T O T H E
READER.
ALTHOUGH we cannot, with juf-
tice, compare Elias Afhmole to
that excellent Antiquary John Leland, or
William Lilly to the learned and inde-
fatigable Thomas Hearne; yet I think
we may fairly rank them with fuch writers
as honeft Antony Wood, whofe Diary
greatly refembles that of his cotemporary,
and intimate friend, Elias Afhmole.
Some
( 4 )
Some anecdotes, conne&ed with affairs
of ftate ; many particulars relating to il-
luftrious perfons, and antient and noble
families ; feveral occurrences in which
the Public is interefted, and other matters
of a more private nature, can only be
found in works of this kind. Hiftory
cannot ftoop to the meannefs of examin-
ing the materials of which Memoirs are
generally compofed.
And yet the pleafure and benefit re-
fulting from fuch books, are manifeft to
every reader.
I hope the admirers of the very labo-
rious Thomas Hearne will pardon me, if
I fhould venture to give it as my opinion,
and with much deference to their judg-
ment, that William Lilly's Life and Death
of Charles the firft, contains more ufeful
matter of inftruflion, as well as more
plendid and ftriking occurrences, than
are to be found in feveral of thofe monk-
ifh
( 5 )
ifh volumes publifhed by that learned
Oxonian,
Lilly affords us many curious parti-
culars relating to the life of that un-
fortunate Prince, which are no where elfe
to be found. In delineating the cha-
racter of Charles, he feems difpaffionate
and impartial, and indeed it agrees per-
fectly with the general portraiture of
him, as it is drawn by our moft authentic
Hiftorians.
The Hiftory of Lilly's Life and Times
is certainly one of the moft entertaining
narratives in our language. With refpedt
to the fcience he profefled of calculating
nativities, calling figures, the prediction
of events, and other appendages of Aftro-
logy, he would fain make us think that
he was a very folemn and ferious Believer,
Indeed, fuch is the manner oÂ£ telling his
ftory, that fometimes the Reader may
poffibly be induced to fuppofe Lilly ra-
ther an Enthufiaft than an Impoftor. He
relates
( 6 )
relates many anecdotes of the pretenders
to foretell events, raife fpirits, and other
impoftures, with fuch feeming candor,
and with fuch an artlefs fimplicity of
flyle, that we are almoft perfuaded to take
his word when he protefts fuch an in-
violable refpeft to truth and fincerity.
The powerful genius of Shakefpeare
could carry him triumphantly through
fubjedts the moll unpromifing, and fa-
bles the moft improbable : we therefore
cannot wonder at the fuccefs of fuch of
his plays, where the magic of witches,
and the incantation of fpirits are defcribed,
or where the power of Fairies is intro-
duced ; when fuch was the Credulity of
the times refpefting thefe imaginary Be-
ings, and when that belief was made a
fcience of, and kept alive by artful and
fuperftitious, knavifh and enthufiaftic
teachers ; what Lilly relates of thefe peo-
ple, confidered only as matter of faft, is
furely very curious.
To
( 7 )
To conclude ; I know no Record but
this where we can find fo juft, and fo enter-
taining a Hiftory of Do&or Dee, Doftor
Forman, Booker, Winder, Kelly, Evans,
(Lilly's Matter) the famous William Poole,
and Captain Bubb Fifke, Sarah Shelborne,
and many others.
To thefe we may add,' the uncommon
effects of the Cryftal, the appearance of
Queen Mabb, and other ftrange and mi-
raculous, operations, which owe their ori-
gin to folly, curiofity, fuperftition, bi-
gotry and impofture.

LIFE
X> F
WILLIAM LILLY,
Student in astrology.
Wrote by himfelf in the 66th Year of his Age,
at Hersham, in the Parifh of Walton
upon Thames, in the County of Surry.
Propria Mann.
I WAS born in the county of Leices-
ter, in an obfcure town, in the north-
weft borders thereof, called Difeworth,
feven miles fouth of the town of Derby,
one mile from Caftle-Donnington, a town
of great rudenefs, wherein it is not re-
membered that any of the farmers thereof
did ever educate any of their fons to learn-
ing, only my grandfather fent his younger
B .
'
fon
2 Mr. Lilly's History
fon to Cambridge, whofe name was Ro-
bert Lilly , and died Vicar of Cambden in
Gloucefterihire, about 1640.
The town of Difeworth did formerly
belong unto the Lord Seagrave, for there
is one record in the hands of my coufin
Melborn Williamfon, which mentions
one acre of land abutting north upon the
gates of the Lord Seagrave ; and there is
one clofe, called Hall-clofe, wherein the
ruins of fome ancient Buildings appear,
and particularly where the dove-houfe
ftood ; and there is alfo the ruins of de-
cayed fifh-ponds and other outhoufes.
This town came at length to be the inhe-
ritance of Margaret, Countefs of Rich-
mond, Mother of Henry VII. which
Margaret gave this town and lordfhip of
Difeworth unto Chrift's College in Cam-
bridge, the Mafter and Fellows whereof
have ever lince, and at prefent, enjoy and
poflefs it.
In the church of this town there is but
one monument, and that is a white mar-
ble ftone, now almoft broken to pieces,
which was placed there by Robert Lilly,
my grandfather, in memory of Jane his
wife, the daughter of Mr. Poole of Dal-
by, in the fame county, a family now
quite extinguifhed. My grandmother's
brother was Mr. Henry Poole, one of the
Knights of Rhodes, or Templars, who
of his* Life and Times. 3
being a foldier at Rhodes at the taking
thereof by Solyman the Magnificent, and
efcaping with his life, came afterwards to
England, and married the Lady Parron
or Perham, of Oxfordshire, and was cal-
led, during his life, Sir Henry Poole.
William Poole the Aftrologer knew him
very well, and remembers him to have
been a very tall perfon, and reputed of
great ftrength in his younger years.
The impropriation of this town of
Difeworth was formerly the inheritance of
three filters, whereof two became vota-
ries j one in the nunnery of Langly in
the parifh of Difeworth, valued at the
fuppreflion, I mean the whole nunnery,
at thirty-two pounds per annum, and this
fillers part is yet enjoyed by the family of
the Grayes, who now, and for fome years
paft, have the enjoyment and poffeffion
of all the lands formerly belonging to the
nunnery in the parifh of Difeworth, and
are at prefent of the yearly value of three
hundred and fifty pounds per annum.
One of the fillers gave her part of the
great tithes unto a religious houfe in Bre-
don upon the Hill ; and, as the inhabi-
tants report, became a religious perfon
afterwards.
The third fifter married, and her part
of the tithes in fucceeding ages became the
B z garl
4 Mi'. Lilly's History
Earl of Huntingdon's, who not many
years nnce fold it to one of his fervants.
The donation of the vicarage is in the
gift of the Grayes of Langley, unto whom
they pay yearly, (I mean unto the Viear)
as I am informed, fix pounds per annum.
Very lately fome charitable citizens have
purchafed one third portion of the tithes,
and given it for a maintenance of a preach-
ing minifter, and it is now of the value
of about fifty pounds per annum.
There have been two hermitages in this
parifh the laft hermit was well remem-
bered by one Thomas Cooke, a very an-
cient inhabitant, who in my younger years
acquainted me therewith.
This town of Difewr
orth is divided into
three parifhes ; one part belongs unto
Lockington, in which part ftandeth my
father's houfe, over-againft the weft end
of the fteeple, in which I was born: fome
other farms are in the parifh of Bredon,
the reft in the parifh of Difeworth.
In this town, but in the parifh of Lock-
ington, was I born, the firft day of May,
1602.
My father's name was William Lilly,
fon of Robert, the fon of Robert, the foil
of Rowland, &c. My mother was Alice,
the daughter of Edward Barham, of Fif-
kerton Mills, in Nottinghamfhire, two
miles from Newark upon Trent: this Ed-
ward
or his Life and Times. $
ward Barham was born in Norwich, and
well remembered the rebellion of Kett the
Tanner, in the days of Edward VI.
Our family have continued many ages
in this town as yeomen ; befides the farm
my father and his anceftors lived in, both
my father and grandfather had much free
land, and many houfes in the town, not
belonging to the college, as the farm
wherein they were all born doth, and is
now at this prefent of the value of forty
pounds per annum, and in poffeffion of
my brother's fon ; but the freehold land
and houfes, formerly purchafed by my an-
ceftors, were all fold by my grandfather
and father; fo that now our family depend
wholly upon a college leafe. Of my in-*
fancy I can fpeak little, only I do remem-
ber that in the fourth year of my age I
had the meafles.'
I was, during my minority, put to learn
at fuch fchools, and of fuch matters, as
the rudenefs of the place and country af-r
forded ; my mother intending I (hould be
a fcholar from my infancy, feeing my fa-
ther's backflidings in the world, and no
hopes by plain hufbandry to recruit a de-
cayed eftate j therefore upon Trinity Tuef-
day, 1 6 1 3, my father had me to Afhby de
la Zouch, to be inftrufted by one Mr.
John Brinfley; one, in thofe times, of
great abilities for inftru6tion of youth in
B 3 the
6 Mr. Lilly's History
the Latin and Greek tongues ; he was ve-
ry fevere in his life and cqnverfation, and
did breed up many fcholars for the uni-
verfities : in religion he was a ftrift Puri-
tan, not conformable wholly to the cere-
monies of the Church of England. In
this town of Afhby de la Zouch, for many
years together, Mr. Arthur Hilderfham
exercifed his minillry at my being there
;
and all the while I continued at Afhby, he
was filenced. This is that famous Hil-
derfham, who left behind him a commen-
tary on the fifty-firft Pfalm -
} as alfq many
fermons upon the fourth of John, both
which are printed : he was an excellent
textuary, of exemplary life, pleafant in
difcourfe, a ftrong enemy to the Brown-
ifts, and diflented not from the Church
of England in any article of faith, but
only about wearing the furplice, baptiz-
ing with the crofs, and kneeling at the
facrament ; moft of the people in the
town were directed by his judgment, and
fo continued, and yet do continue prefby-
terianly affefted ; for when the Lord of
Loughborough in 1642, 1643, 1644, and
1645, had his garrifon in that town, if
by chance at any time any troops of horfe
had lodged within the town, though they
came late at night to their quarters ; yet
would one or other of the town prefently
give Sir John Gell of Derby notice, fo
2 that
OF HIS LlLE AND TlMES. 7
that ere next morning mod of his Maje-
fty's troops were feized in their lodgings,
which moved the Lord of Loughborough
merrily to fay, there was not a fart let in
Afby but it was prefently carried to Derby,
The feveral authors I there learned were
thefe, viz. Sententise Pueriles, Cato, Cor-
derius, iEfop's Fables, Tully's Offices,
Ovid de Triftibus ; laftly, Virgil, then
Horace ; as alfo Camden's Greek Gram-
mar, Theognis and Homer's Iliads : I
was only entered into Udall's Hebrew
Grammar; he never taught Logick, but
often would fay it was fit to be learned in
the univerfities,
In the fourteenth year of my age, by a
fellow fcholar of fwarth, black complexion?
I had like to have my right eye beaten
out as we were at play ; the fame year,
about Michaelmas, I got a furfeit, and
thereupon a fever, by eating beech-nuts.
In the fixteenth year of my age I was
exceedingly troubled in my dreams con-
cerning my falvation and damnation, and
alfo concerning the fafety and deftruc-
tion of the fouls of my father and mo-
ther; in the nights I frequently wept,
prayed and mourned, for fear my fins
might offend God.
In the feventeenth year of my age my
mother died.
B 4 In
8 Mr. Lilly's History
v
In the eighteenth year of my age my
mafter Brinfley was enforced from keep-
ing fchool, being perfecuted by the Bi-
fhop's officers, he came to London, and
then lectured in London, where he after-
wards died. In this ye^r, by reafon of
my father's poverty, I was alfo enforced
to leave fchool, and fo came to my father's
houfe, where I lived in much penury for.
one year, and taught fchool one quarter
of a year, until God's providence pro-
vided better for mp.
For the two laft y^ars of my being at
fchool, I was of the higheft form in the
fchool, and chiefeft of that form ; I could
then fpeak Latin as well as Englifh ; could
make extempore verfes upon any theme
;
all kinds of verfes, Hexameter, Pentame-
ter, Phaleuciacks, Iambicks, Sapphicks,
&c. fo that if any fcholars from remote
fchools came to difpute, I was ringleader
to difpute with them ; I could cap ver-
fes, &c. If any minifter came to exa-
mine us, I was brought forth againft him,
nor would I argue with him unlefs in the
Latin tongue, which I found few of them
could well fpeak without breaking Prif-
cian's head â¢ which, if once they did, I
would complain to my mafter, Non bene
intelligit linguam Latinam, nec prorfus loqui-
tur. In the derivation of words, I found
moft
of his Life and Times. 9
moft of them defective, nor indeed were
any of them good grammarians : all and
every of thofe fcholars who were of my
form and ftanding, went to Cambridge
and proved excellent divines, only poor I,
William Lilly, was not fo happy ; for-
tune then frowning upon father's prefent
condition, he not in any capacity to
maintain me at the univerfity.
Of the Manner how I came unto
London.
Worthy fir, I take much delight to
recount unto you, even all and every
circumftance of my life, whether good,
moderate, or evil ; Deo gloria.
My father had one Samuei Smatty for
his Attorney, unto whom I went fundry
times with letters, who perceiving I was
a fcholar, and that I lived miferably in
the country, lofing my time, nor any
ways likely to do better, if I continued
there ; pitying my condition, he fent word
for me to come and fpeak with him, and
told me that he had lately been at Lon-
don, where there was a gentleman wanted
a youth, to attend him and his wife, who
could write, &c.
I acquainted my father with it, who
w^s very willing to be rid pf me, for I
could
io Mr. Lilly's History
could not work, drive the plough, or
endure any country labour; my fa-
ther oft would fay, I was good for no-
thing.
I had only twenty {hillings, and no
more, to buy me a new fuit, hofe, dou-
blet, &c. my doublet was fuftian : I re-
paired to Mr. Smatty, when I was ac-
coutred, for a letter to my matter, which
he gave me.
Upon ft/Tonday, April 3, 1620, I de-
parted from Difeworth, and came to Lei-
cefter : but I muft acquaint you, that
before I came away I vifited my friends,
amongft whom I had given me about
ten fhillings, which was a great comfort
unto me. On Tuefday, April the 4th,
I took leave of my father, then in Lei-
cefter gaol for debt, and came along with
Bradfhaw the carrier, the fame perfon
with whom many of the Duke of Bucking-
ham's kindred had come up with. Hark
how the waggons crack with their rich
lading ! It was a very ftormy week, cold
and uncomfortable : I footed it all along
;
we could not reach London until Palm-
Sunday, the 9th of April, about half an
hour after three in the afternoon, at
which time we entered Smithfield. When
I had gratified the carrier and his fer-
vants, I had feven fhillings and fix pence
left, and no more ; one fuit of cloaths
upon
of his Life and Times. ii
upon my back, two fhirts, three bands,
one pair of fhoes, and as many ftockings.
Upon the delivery of my letter my mafter
entertained me, and next day bought
me a new cloak, of which you may ima-
gine (good Efquire) whether I was not
proud of ; befides, I faw and eat good
white bread, contrary to our diet in Lei-
cefterfhire. My matter's name was Gil-
bert Wright, born at Market Bofworth
in Leicefterfhire ; my miftrefs was born
at Afhby de la Zouch, in the fame county,
and in the town where I had gone to>
fchool. This Gilbert Wright could nei-
ther write nor read; he lived upon his
annual rents, was of no calling or pro-
feffion ; he had for many years been fer-
vant to the Lady Pawlet in Hertfordfhire
;
and when Serjeant Puckering was made
Lord keeper, he made him keeper of his
lodgings at Whitehall. When Sir Tho-
mas Egerton was made Lord Chancellor,
he entertained him in the fame place ; and
when he married a widow in Newgate
Market, the Lord Chancellor recom-
mended him to the company of Salters,
London, to admit him into their com-
pany, and fo they did, and my mafter in
1624, was mafter of that company; he
was a man of excellent natural parts, and
would fpeak publickly upon any occafion
very rationally and to the purpofe. I
write
12 Mr. Lilly's History
write this, that the world may know he
was no taylor, or myfelf of that or any
other calling or profeffion : My work was
to go before my mafter to church ; to at-
tend my mafter when he went abroad
;
to make clean his fhoes ; fweep theftreet;
help to drive bucks when we wafhed;
fetch water in a tub from the Thames :
I have helped to carry eighteen tubs of
water in one morning, weed the garden
;
all manner of drudgeries I willingly per-
formed ;
fcrape trenchers, &c. If I had
any profeffion, it was of this nature : I
fhould never have denied my being a tay-
lor, had I been one ; for there is no cal-
ling fo bafe, which by God's mercy may
not afford a livelihood ; and had not my
mafter entertained me, I would have been
of a very mean profeffion ere I would
have returned into the country again
;
fo here ends the aftions of eighteen years
of my life.
My mafter married his fecond wife for
her eftate ; flie was competently rich y
fhe married him for confiderations he
performed not, (nofturnal fociety) fo
that they lived very uncomfortably ; fhe
was about feventy years of age, he fixty
fix or more ;
yet never was any woman
more jealous of a hufband than fhe ; in-
fcmuch, that whenfoever he went into
London, fhe was confident of his going
to
of his Life and Times. fc
rj
to women; by thofe means my life was
the more uncomfortable, it being very
difficult to pleafe two fuch oppofite na-
tures : However, as to the things of this
world I had enough, and endured their
difcontents with much ferenenefs. My
miftrefs was very curious to know of fuch
as were then called cunning or wife men,
whether fhe fhould bury her hulband ?
She frequently vifited fuch perfons, and
this occafion begot in me a little defire to
learn fomething that way, but wanting
money to buy books, I laid afide thefe
motions, and endeavoured 4
to pleafe both
mafter and miftrefs.
Of my Miftrefs' s Death, and Occa-
fion thereof by Means of a Can-
cer in her Breaft.
In 1622 fhe complained of a pain in her
left breaft, whereon there appeared at firft
a hard knob no bigger than a fmall pea
;
it increafed in a little time very much,
was very hard, and fometimes would look
very red; fhe took advice of furgeons,
had oils, fear-cloths, plates of lead, and
what not: In 1623 it grew very big, and
fpread all over her breaft ; then for many
weeks pultices were applied to it, which
in continuance of time broke the fkin,
and
14 Mr. Lilly's History
and then abundance of watery tliin fluff
came from it, but nothing elfe ; at length
the matter came to fuppuration, but never
any great ftore iffued forth it was ex-
ceeding noifome and painful; from the
beginning of it until fhe died, (he would
permit no furgeon to drefs it but only
myfelf ; I applied every thing unto it, and
her pains were fo great the winter before
fhe died, that I have been called out of
my bed two or three times in one night
to drefs it and change plaifters. In 1624
by degrees with fcifiars I cut all the whole
breaft away, I mean the finews, nerves,
&c. In one fortnight, or little more,
it appeared, as it were, mere flefh, all
raw, fo that fhe could fcarce endure any
unguent to be applied. I remember there
was a great cleft through the middle of
the breaft, which when that fully ap-
peared flie died, which was in September
1624 ; my mafter being then in the coun-
try, his kindred in London would wil-
lingly have had mourning for her ; but
by advice of an efpecial friend of his I
contradifted them ; nor would I permit
them to look into any cheft or trunk in
the houfe : She was decently buried, and
fo fond of me in the time of her ficknefs,
fhe would never permit me out of her
chamber, gave me five pounds in old
gold, and fent me unto a private trunk of
hers
of his Life and Times. 15
hers at a friend's houfe, where fhe had
one hundred pounds in gold ; flie bid
me bring it away and take it, but when
I opened the trunk I found nothing there-
in ; for a kinfman of hers had been there
a few days before and carried all away
:
She was in a great paffion at my relating
thereof, becaufe fhe could not gratify my
pains in all her ficknefs, advifed me to
help myfelf when fhe was gone, out of
my matter's goods, which I never did.
Courteous Efquire, be not weary of
reading hereof, or what followeth.
When my miftrefs died, ftie had under
her arm-hole a fmall fcarlet bag full of
many things, which, one that was there
delivered unto me. There was in this
bag feveral figils, fome of Jupiter in Trine,
others of the nature of Venus, fome of
iron, and one of gold, of pure angel-
gold, of the bignefs of a thirty three
(hilling piece of King James's coin. In
the circumference on one fide was en-
graven, Vicit Leo de tribu "Judce lietragram-
maton -}-, within the middle there was
engraven an holy lamb. In the other
circumference there was Amraphel and
three 4-. In the middle, Sanftus Petrus,
Alpha and Omega.
The occafion of framing this figil wr
as
thus; her former hufband travelling into
SufTex, happened to lodge in an inn, and
to
16 Mr. Lilly's History
to lie in a chamber thereof ; wherein, not
many months before a country grazier liad
lain, and in the night cut his own throat
;
after this night's lodging hewas perpetually,
and for many years, followed by a fpirit,
which vocally and articulately provoked
him to cut his throat ; he was ufed fre-
quently to fay, ' I defy thee, I defy thee/
and to fpit at the fpirit ; this fpirit foU
lowed him many years, he not making
any body acquainted with it ; at laft he
grew melancholly and difcontented ; which
being carefully obferved by his wife, fhe
many times hearing him pronounce, <
I
defy thee/ &c. fhe defired him to acquaint
her with the caufe of his diftemper, which
he then did. Away fhe went to Dr.
Simon Forman, who lived then in Lam-
beth, and acquaints him with it; who
having framed this figil, and hanged it
about his neck, he wearing it continually
until he died, was never more molefted
by the fpirit : I fold the figil for thirty
two millings, but tranfcribed the words
verbatims I have related. Sir, you mail
now have a (lory of this Simon Forman,
as his widow, whom I well knew, re-
lated it unto me. But before I relate
his death, I fhall acquaint you fome-
thing of the man, as I . have gathered
them from fome manufcripts of his own
writing.
Of
of his Life and Times.
Of Dr. Simon Forman.
He was a chandler's fon in the city
of Weftminfter* He travelled into Hol-
land for a month in 1580, purpofely to
be inftrlifted in aftrology, and other more
occult fciences % as alfo in phyfick, tak-
ing his degree of Doctor beyond feas : be-
ing fufficiently furnifhed and inftrufted
with what he defired, he returned into
England towards the latter end of the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and flourifhed
until that year of King James, wherein
the Countefs of Effex, the Earl of Somer-
fet, and Sir Thomas Overbury's matters
were queftioned. He lived in Lambeth
w7
ith a very good report of the neighbour-
hood, efpecially of the poor, unto whom
he was charitable. He was a perfon that
in horary queftions (efpecially thefts) was
very judicious and fortunate ; fo alfo in
fickneffes, which indeed was his mafter-
piece. In refolving queftions about mar-
riage he had good fuccefs : in other quef-
tions very moderate. He was a perfon of
indefatigable pains. I have feen fome-
times half one fheet of paper wrote of
his judgment upon one queftion ; in
writing whereof he ufed much tautology,
as you may fee yourfelf (moft excellent
Efquire) if you read a great book of Dr.
C â¢ Flood's,
i8 Mr. Lilly's History
Hood's, which you have, who had all
that book from the manufcripts of For-
man for I have feen the fame word for
word in an Englifh manufcript formerly
belonging to Doctor Willoughby of Glou-
cefterihire. Had Forman lived to have
methodized his own papers, I doubt not
but he would have advanced the Jatro-
mathematical part thereof very compleatly
;
for he was very obfervant, and kept notes
of the fuccefs of his judgments, as in
many of his figures I have obferved. I
very well remember to have read in one of
his manufcripts, what followeth.
' Being in bed one morning' (fays he) ' I
' was defirous to know whether I fhould
' ever be a Lord, Earl or Knight, &c.
/ whereupon I fet a figure ; and thereupon
' my judgment / by which he concluded,
that within two years time he (hould be
a Lord or great man : f But/ fays he, ' be-
' fore the two years were expired, the
/ Doclors put me in Newgate, and no-
.* thing came/ Not long after, he was
defirous to know the fame things con-

One Coleman, clerk to Sir Thomas

The Knight brought him into the ftar-
chamber, had his fervant fentenced to be
pilloried, whipped, and afterwards, dur-
ing life, to be imprifoned. The fentence
was executed in London, and was to be
in Leicefterfhire: Two keepers were to
convey Coleman from the Fleet to Lei-
cefter. My miflrefs taking coniideration
of Coleman, and the miferies he was to
fuffer, went prefently to Forman, ac-
quainted him therewith ; who, after con-
lideration, fwore Coleman had lain both
with mother and daughters ; and befides

lock his chain under the horfe's belly
as formerly, but locked it only to one *

fity to untrufs, and fo the other and
Coleman ftood ftill ; by and by the other

C 4 After
24 MR - Lilly's History
After my miftrefs was dead, I lived
moft comfortably, my mafter having a
great affeftion for me.
The year 1625 now comes on, and
the plague exceeding violent, I will re-
late what I obferved the fpring before
it broke forth. Againft our corner houfe
every night there would come down, a-
bout five or fix of the clock, fometime
one hundred or more boys, fome play-
ing, others as if in ferious difcourfe, and
juft as it grew dark would all be gone
home j many fucceeding years there was
no fuch, or any concourfe ufually, no
more than four or five in a company
:
In the fpring of 1625, the boys and
youths of feveral parifhes in like num-
ber appeared again, which I beholding,
called Thomas Sanders, my landlord, and
told him, that the youth and young
boys of feveral parifhes did in that na-
ture affemble and play, in the beginning
of the year 1625. ' God blefs us/ quoth
I, ' from a plague this year/ but then
there fucceeded one, and the greatefl that
ever was in London. In 1025, the vifi-
tation encreafing, and my mafter having
a great charge of money and plate, fome
of his own, fome other men's, left me
and a fellow-fervant to keep the houfe,
and himfelf in June went into Leicefter-
fhire. He was in that year feoffee col-
leftor
of his Life and Times. 25
lcflor for twelve poor alms-people living
in Clement-Dane's Church-Yard whofe
penfions I in his abfence paid weekly, to
his and parifh's great fatisfaction. My
matter was no fooner gone down, but I
bought a bafs-viol, and got a mafter to
inftruft me ; the intervals of time I fpent
in bowling in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, with
Wat the cobler, Dick the blackfmith, and
fuch like companions : We have fome-
times been at our work at fix in the morn-
ing, and fo continued till three or four in
the afternoon, many times without bread
or drink all that while. Sometimes I
went to church and heard funeral fer-
mons, of which there was then great
plenty. At other times I went early to
St. Antholine's in London, where there
was every morning a fermon. The moft
able people of the whole city and fuburbs
were out of town; if any remained, it
were fuch as were engaged by parifh-
offices to remain ; no habit of a gentle^
man or woman continued ; the woeful
calamity of that year was grievous, peo-
ple dying in the open fields and in the
open ftreets. At laft, in Auguft, the
bills of mortality fo encreafed, that very
few people had thoughts of furviving the
contagion : The Sunday before the great
bill came forth, which was of five thoufand
and odd hundreds, there was appointed
a facra-
26 Mr. Lilly's History
a facramest at Clement Dane's ; during
the diftributing whereof I do very well
remember we fang thirteen parts of the
one hundred and nineteeth Pfalm. One
Jacob, our minifter (for we had three that
day, the communion was fo great) fell
fick as he was giving the facrament, went
home, and was buried of the plague the
Thurfday following. Mr. James, ano-
ther of the minifters, fell fick ere he had
quite finifhed, had the plague, and was
thirteen weeks ere he recovered. Mr.
Whitacre, the laft of the three, efcaped
not only then, but all the contagion fol-
lowing, without any ficknefs at all;
though he officiated at every funeral, and
buried all manner of people, whether
they died of the plague or not. He was
given to drink, feldom could preach more
than one quarter of an hour at a time,
&c. In November my matter came home.
My fellow-fervant's and my diet came
weekly to fix (hillings and fix pence,
fometimes to feven {hillings, fo cheap was
diet at that time.
In February of that year, my matter
married again (one who after his death
became my wife). In the fame year he
fettled upon me, during my life, twenty
pounds per annum> which I have enjoyed
ever fince, even to the writing hereof.

May 22, 1627, my mafter died at the
corner houfe in the Strand, where I alfo
lived fo long. He died inteftate ; my
miftrefs relinquifliing the adminiftration,
it came to his elder brother, who affigned
the eftate over to me for payment of my
matter's debts ; which being paid, I faith-
fully returned the remaining part unto
his adminiftrator ; nor had one penny of
the eftate more than twenty pounds per
annum, which was allowed me by con-
tract, to undertake the payment of my
matter's debts,
Of my Marriage the firft Time.
My miftrefs had been twice married
to old men, was now refolved to be cou-
?ened no more; fhe was of a brown
ruddy complexion, corpulent, of but
mean ftature, plain, no education, yet a
very provident perfon, and of good con-
dition : She had many fuitors, old men,
whom ftie declined ; fome gentlemen of
decayed fortunes^ whom fhe liked not,
for fhe was covetous and fparing ;
By my
fellow-fervant fhe was obferved frequently
to fay, fhe cared not if fhe married a
man that would love her, fo that he had
never a penny ; and would ordinarily talk
of me when ftie was in bed : This fer-
yant
2S Mr. Lilly's History
vant gave me encouragement to give the
onfet : I was much perplexed hereat, for
fhould I attempt her, and be flighted, fhe
would never care for me afterwards ; but
again, I considered that if I fhould at-
tempt and fail, fhe would never fpeak
of it; or would any believe I durft be fo
audacious as to propound fuch a quef-
tion, the difproportion of years and for-
tune being fo great betwixt us : However,
all her talk was of hufbands, and in my
prefence faying one day after dinner, fhe
refpecled not wealth, but defired an ho-
neft man ; I made anfwer, I thought I
could fit her with fuch a hufband ; fhe
allied me, where ? I made no more ado,
but prefently faluted her, and told her
myfelf was the man : She replied, I was
too young; I faid nay; what I had not
in wealth, I would fupply in love ; and
faluted her frequently, which (he ac-
cepted lovingly ; and next day at dinner
made me fit down at dinner with my
hat on my head, and faid, fhe intended
to make me her hufband ; for which I
gave her many falutes, &c.
I was very careful to keep all things
fecret, for I well knew, if fhe fhould take
counfel of any friend, my hopes would be
fruftrated, therefore I fuddenly procured
her confent to marry, unto which fhe
affented ; fo that upon the eighth dav
of
i
of his Life and Times. 29
of September 1627, at St. George's church'
in Southwark, I was married unto her,
and for two whole years we kept it
fecret. When it was divulged, and loose
people blamed her for it, (he conftantly
replied, that (lie had no kindred; if I
proved kind, and a good huiband, flic
would make me a man ; if I proved
otherwife, fhe only undid herfetf. In
the third and fourth years after our mar-
riage, we had ftrong fuits of law with
her firft hufband's kindred, but over-
threw them in the end. During all the
time of her life, which was until Oftober
1633, we lived very lovingly, I frequent-
ing no company at all ; my exercifes were
fometimes angling, in which I ever de-
lighted : My companions, two aged men.
I then frequented lectures, two or three
in a week ; I heard Mr. Sute in Lombard-
Street, Mr. Gouge of Elack-Fryars, Dr.
Micklethwait of the Temple, Dr. Oldf-
worth, with others, the moft learned men
of thefe times, and leaned in judgment to
Puritanifm. In October 1627, 1 was made
free of the Salters company in London.
How I came to ftudjr Aftrology.
It happened on one Sunday 1632, as
xnyfelf and a Juftice of Peace's clerk were,
before
30 Mr. Lilly's History
before fervice, difcourfing of many things,
he chanced to fay, that fuch a perfon was
a great fcholar, nay, fo learned, that he
could make an Almanack, which to me
then was ftrange : One fpeech begot ano-
ther, till, at laft, he faid, he could bring
me acquainted with one Evans in Gun-
Powder -Alley, who had formerly lived in
Staffordfhire, that was an excellent wife
man, and ftudied the Black Art. The
fame week after we went to fee Mr. Evans.
When we came to his houfe, he having
been drunk the night before, was upon
his bed, if it be lawful to call that a bed
whereon he then lay ; he roufed up him-
felf, and, after fome compliments, he was
content to inftruft me in aftrology ; I
attended his beft opportunities for feven
or eight weeks, in which time I could
fet a figure perfectly : Books he had not
any, except Haly de judiciis Aftrorum,
and Orriganus's Ephemerides ; fo that
as often as I entered his houfe, I thought
I was in the Wildernefs. Nowfomething
of the man : He was by birth a Welfh-
man, a Mafter of Arts, and in facred
orders; he had formerly had a cure of
fouls in Staffordfhire, but now was come
to try his fortunes at London, being in a
manner enforced to fly for fome offences
very fcandalous committed by him in
thefe parts, where hu had lately lived.;
of his Life and Times. 31
for he gave judgment upon things loft,
the only fhame of aftrology : He was the
moft faturnine perfon my eyes ever be-
held, either before I pra&ifed or fmce
;
of a middle ftature, broad forehead, beetle-
browed, thick fhoulders, flat nofed, full
lips, down-looked, black curling ftiff
hair, fplay-footed ; to give him his right,
he had the moft piercing judgment na-
turally upon a figure of theft, and many
other queftions, that I ever met withal
;
yet for money he would willingly give
contrary judgments, was much addifted
to debauchery, and then very abufive and
quarrelfome, feldom without a black eye,
or one mifchief or other : This is the
fame Evans who made fo many antimo-
nial cups, upon the fale whereof he prin-
cipally fubfifted ; he underftood Latin very
well, the Greek tongue not at all: He
had fome arts above, and beyond aftro-
logy, for he was well verfed in the na-
ture of fpirits, and had many times ufed
the circular way of invocating, as in the
time of our familiarity he told me. Two
of his aftions I will relate, as to me de-
livered. There was in StafFordlhire a
young gentlewoman that had, for her
preferment, married an aged rich perfon,
who being defirous to purchafe fome
lands for his wife's maintenance ; but
this young gentlewoman, his wife, was
defired
32 Mr. Lilly's History
defired to buy the land in the name of a
gentleman, her very dear friend, but
for her ufe : After the aged man was
â¢dead, the widow could by no means pro-
cure the deed of purchafe from her friend;
whereupon {he applies herfelf to Evans,
who, for a fum of money, promifes to
have her deed fafely delivered into her
own hands ; the fum was forty pounds.
Evans applies himfelf to the invocation
of the angel Salmon, of the nature of
Mars, reads his Litany in the Common-
Prayer-Book every day, at feleft hours,
wears his furplice, lives orderly all that
time ; at the fortnight's end Salmon ap-
peared, and having received his com-
mands what to do, in a fmall time re-
turns with the very deed defired, lays it
down gently upon a table where a white
cloth was fpread, and then, being dif-
miffed, vanifhcd. The deed was, by the
gentleman who formerly kept it, placed
among many other of his evidences in a
large wooden cheft, and in a chamber at
one end of the houfe ; but upon Salmon's
removing and bringing away the deed, all
that bay of building was quite blown down,
and all his own proper evidences torn all to
pieces. The fecond ftory folioweth.
Some time before I became acquainted
with him, he then living in the Mino-
ries, was defired by the Lord Bothwell
and
of his Life and Times. 33
and Sir Kenelm Digby to fhow them a
fpirit. He promifed fo to do : the time
came, and they were all in the body of
the circle, when lo, upon a fudden, after
fome time of invocation, Evans was taken
from out the room, and carried into the
field near Batterfea Caufeway, clofe to the
Thames. Next morning a countryman
going by to his labour, and efpying a man
in black cloaths, came unto him and
awaked him, and afked him how he came
there ? Evans by this underftood his con-
dition, enquired where he was, how far
from London, and in what parifh he was
;
which when he underftood, he told the
labourer he had been late at Batterfea the
night before, and by chance was left there
by his friends. Sir Kenelm Digby and
the Lord Bothwell went home without
any harm, came next day to hear what
was become v * him; juft as they in the
afternoon came into the houfe, a meffen-
ger came from Evans to his wife, to come
to him at Batterfea. I enquired upon
what account the fpirit carried him away
:
who faid, he had not, at the time of in
vocation, made any fuffumigation, at
which the fpirits were vexed. It hap-
pened, that after I difcerned what aftro-
logy was, I went weekly into Little-
Britain, and bought many books of aftro-
logy, not acquainting Evans therewith.
D Mr.
34 Mr. Lilly's History
Mr. A. Eedwell, Minifter of Tottenham^
High-Crofs near London, who had been
many years chaplain to Sir Henry Wot-
ton, whilft he was Ambafiador at Venke>
and aflifced Pietro Soave Polano, in com-
pering and writing the Council of Trent,
was lately dead ; and his library being
fold into Little- Britain, I bought a-
mongft them my choicefi books of aftro-
logy. The occafion of our falling out
was thus : a woman demanded the re-
folution of a queftion, which when he
had done, Are went her way ; I {landing
by all the while, and observing the figure,
afked him why he gave the judgment he
did, fince the figmfication fhewed quite the
contrary, and gave him my reafons ; which
when he had pondered, he called me boy,
â¢and muft he be contradicted by fueh a
novice ? But when his heat was aver, he
laid, had he not fo judged to pleafe the
woman, fixe would have given him nor-
thing, and he had a wife and family to
provide for ; upon this we never came
together after. Being now very meanly
introduced, I applied myfelf to ltudy thofe
books I had obtained, many times twelve,
or fifteen, or eighteen hours day and
night ; I was curious to difcover, whe-
ther there was any verity in the art or
not. Aftrology in this time, viz. in 1633,
was very rare in London, few profeffing.

it that underftood any thing thereof.
Let it not repent you (O noble Efquire)
if now I make a fliort digreffion of fuch
perfons as then profefled aftrology, that
pofterity may underftand in what condi-
tion I found it, and in whofe hands that
little that remained was lodged.
There lived then in Houndfditch one
Alexander Hart, who had been a foldier
formerly, a comely old man, of good
afpeft ; he profefled queftionary aftrology,
and a little of phyfick; his greateft fkill
was to eledt young gentlemen fit times to
play at dice, that they might win or get
money. I went unto him for refolutions
for three queftions at feveral times, and
he erred in every one. To fpeak foberly
of him, he was but a cheat, as appeared
fuddenly after; for a ruftical fellow of
the city, defirous of knowledge, con-
tracted with Hart to affift for a confe-
rence with a fpirit, and paid him twenty
pounds of thirty pounds the contraft.
At laft, after many delays, and no fpirit
appearing, or money returned, the young
man indiÂ£ls him for a cheat at the Old-
Bailey in London; the Jury found the
bill, and at the hearing of the caufe this
jell happened : fome of the bench enquired
what Hart did ? * He fat like an Alderman
* in his gown/ quoth the fellow 5 at which
D 2 the
36 Mr. Lilly's History
the court fell into a great laughter, moft
of the court being Aldermen. He was
to have been fet upon the pillory for this
cheat ; but John Taylour, the Water Poet,
being his great friend, got the Lord Chief
Juftice Richardfon to bail him, ere he
flood upon the pillory, and fo Hart fled
prefently into Holland, where he ended
his days. It was my fortune, upon the
fale of his books in 1634, to buy ArgolFs
Primum Mobile for fourteen {hillings,
which I only wanted.
In Lambeth Marfh at the fame time
lived one Captain Bubb, who refolved
horary queftions aftrologically ; a proper
handfome man, well fpoken, but withal
covetous, and of no honefty, as will ap-
pear by this ftory, for which he flood
upon the pillory. A certain butcher was
robbed, going to a fair, of forty pounds
;
he goes to Bubb, who for ten pounds
in hand paid, would help him to the
*hief ; appoints the butcher fuch a night
precifely, to watch at fuch a place, and
the thief fhould come thither -> command-
ed him by any means to flop him ; the
butcher attends according to dire<5tion.
About twelve in the night there comes
one riding very fiercely upon a full gal-
lop, whom the butcher knocks down,
and feized both upon man and horfe
:
The
of his Life and Times. 37
The butcher brings the man and horfe
to the next town, but then the perfon
whom the butcher attacked was John,
the fervant of Dr. Bubb ; for which the
Captain was indifted and fuffered upon
the pillory, and afterwards ended his
days in great difgrace.
There was alfo one Jeffry Neve, at
this time a ftudent in phyfick and aftro-
logy ; he had formerly been a merchant in
Yarmouth, and Mayor of the town, but
failing in eftate, went into the Low-
Countries, and at Franecker took the
degree of Doctor in Phyfick ; he had
fome little fmattering in aftrology ; could
refolve a queftion of theft, or love-quef-
tion, fomething of ficknefs ; a very grave
perfon, laborious and honeft, of tall fea-
ture and comely feature ; he died of late
years, almoft in the very ftreet near Tower-
Hill : He had a defign of printing two
hundred verified queftions, and defired my
approbation ere they went to the prefs ;
that I firft would fee them, and then
give teftirriony. When I had perufed
the firft forty, I corrected thirty of
them, would read over no more : I
ihev/ed him how erroneous they were,
defired his emendation of the reft, which
he performed not. Thefe were after-
wards, in R. Saunders's cuftody, bought

38 Mr. Lilly's History
by him either of his fon or of a ftati-
oner: (a)
There was then William Poole, g.
nibler at aftrology, fometimes a gardener,
an apparitor, a drawer of linen ; as quoifs,
handkerchiefs; a plaifterer and a brick-
layer ; he would brag many times he had
been of feventeen profeffions ; was very
good company for drolling, as you your-
lelf very well remember (moft honoured
Sir) ; (b) he pretended to poetry and
that pofterity may have a tafte of it, you
(hall here have inferted two verfes of his
own making; the occafion of making
them was thus. One Sir Thomas Jay,
a Juftice of the Peace in Rofemary-Lane,
iflued out his warrant for the apprehen-
fion of Poole, upon a pretended fuggef-
tion, that he was in company with fome
lewd people in a Tavern, where a filver
cup was loft, Anglice ftolen. Poole
hearing of the warrant, packs up his
little trunk of books, being all his library,
and runs to Weftminfter ; but hearing

Now alfo lived this Dr. Ardee, but his
true name was Richard Delahay, formerly
an Attorney; he ftudied aftrology and
phyfick, being in neceffity, and forced
from Derbyfhire, where he had lived,
by the old Countefs of Shrewfbury; he
was of moderate judgment, both in altro-
lo.gy and phyfick. He had formerly been
well acquainted with Charles Sledd, (a)

an apothecary, who ufed the cryftal, and
had a very perfeft fight. This Dr. Ardee
hath many times affirmed unto me, [efto
fides) that an angel, one time, appeared
unto him, and offered him a leafe of his
life for one thoufand years : he died about
the age of fourfcore years ; left his wi-
dow, who married into Kent, (a) worth
two or three thoufand pounds, and Wil-
liam Poole's eftate came to four or five
pounds.
In the years 1632, and 1633, John
Booker became famous for a prediction
of his upon a folar eclipfe in the 19th
degree of Aries 1663, taken out of
Leovitius de magnis conjun&ionibus, viz.
Oh Reges & Principes, &c. Both the King
of Bohemia, and Guftavus King of
Sweden, dying during the effefts of that
eclipfe.
John Booker was born in Manchefter,
of good parentage, in the year 1601 ; was
in his youth well inftrufted in the Latin
tongue, which he underftood very well
:
He leemed from his infancy to be defign-
ed for aftrology ; for from the time he
had any underftanding, he would be al-
ways poring on, and ftudying almanacks,.
He came to London at fitting years, and
ferved an apprenticefhip to an haber-

dafher in Laurence-Lane, London ; but
either wanting ftock to fet up, difliking
the calling, he left his trade, and taught
to write at Hadley in Middlefex feveral
fcholars in that fchool: He wrote Angu-
larly well both Secretary and Roman,
In procefs of time he ferved Sir Chrifto-
pher Clethero, Knight, Alderman of
London, as his clerk, being a city Juf-
tice of Peace : He alfo was clerk to Sir
Hugh Hammerfley, Alderman of Lon-
don, both which he ferved with great
credit and eftimation ; and by that means
became not only well known, but as well
refpefted of the moft eminent citizens of
London, even to his dying day.
He was an excellent proficient in aftro-
logy, whofe excellent verfes upon the
twelve months, framed according to the
configurations of each month, being blef-
fed with fuccefs according to his pre-
diftions, procured him much reputation
all over England : He was a very honeft
man, abhorred any deceit in the art he
ftudied ; had a curious fancy in judging
of thefts, and as fuccefsful in refolving
love-queftions : He was no mean profi-
cient in aftronomy ; he underftood much
in phyfick ; was a great admirer of the
antimonial cup; not unlearned in chy-
miftry, which he loved well, but did not
pra&ife. He was inclined to a diabetes
;
ar.d
42 Mr. Lilly's History
and in the laft three years of his life was
afflicted with a dyfentery, which at laft
confumed him to nothing: He died of
good fame in 1667. Since his deceafe I
have feen one nativity of his performance
exaftly directed, and judged with as much
learning as from aftrology can be ex-
pefted.
His library of books came fhort of the
worlds approbation, and were by his
widow fold to Elias Afhmole, Efq; who
moft generoufly gave her [a) far more
money than they were worth ; but out of
his refpefts unto the deceafed and his
memory, he moft willingly paid her the
money. He left behind him two fons
and two daughters. He left in writing
very little but his annual prognostications.
He began firft to write about the year
1630 ; he wrote Belliim Hibernicale, in
the time of the long parliament, a very
fober and judicious book : the epiftle there-
unto I gave him. He wrote lately a
fmall treatife of Eafter- Day, a very learned
thing, wherein he fhewed much learning
and reading. To fay no more of him,
he lived an honeft man, his fame not
queftioned at his death.
In this year 1633, I became acquainted
with Nicholas Filke, licentiate in phyfick,

until he was fit for the univerfity ; but
he went not to the academy, ftudying at;

he afterwards praftifed in Colchefter;
and there was well acquainted with Dr.
Gilbert, who wrote De Magnete. He
came afterwards unto London, and exer-
-cifed his faculty in feveral places thereof.
(For in his youth he would never ftay
iong in one houfe.) In 1633 he was fent
for out of Suffolk by Dr. Winfton of
Grefham College, to inftiuft the Lord
Treafurer Wefton's fon in arithmetick,
aftronomy upon the globes, and their
ufes. He was a perfon very ftudious,
laborious, of good apprehenfion, and had
by his own induftry obtained both in
aftrology, phyfick, arithmetick, aftro-
nomy, geometry and algebra, lingular
judgment : He would in aftrology refolve
horary queftions very foundly ; but was
ever diffident of his own abilities : He
was exquifitely fkilful in the art of direc-
tions upon nativities, and had a good
genius in performing judgment thereupon,
fiut very unhappy he was, that he had

Matthew hath often told me, that where
his father did teach any fcholars in his
time, they would principally learn of him
;
he had Scorpio afcending, and was fe-
cretly envious to thofe he thought had
more parts than himfelf; however, I
muft be ingenuous, and do affirm, that
by frequent converfation with him, I
came to know which were the beft au-
thors, and much to enlarge my judg-
ment, efpecially in the art of dire&ions
:
He vifited me moft days once after I
became acquainted with him, and would
communicate his moft doubtful queftions
unto me, and accept of my judgment
therein rather than his own : He lingu-
larly well judged and direÂ£ted Sir Robert
Holborn's nativity, but defired me to

thereof, which I did, and which nativity
(fince Sir Robert gave it me) came to

[oh learned Efquire] he died about the
feventy-eighth year of his age, poor.
In this year alfo William Bredon, par-

shire, was living, a profound divine, but

had a hand in compofing Sir Chriftopher
Heydon's defence of judicial aftrology,
being that time his chaplain; he was lo
given over to tobacco and drink, that
when he Jiad no tobacco, he would cut
the bell-ropes and fmoke them.
I come now to continue the ftory of
my own life, but thought it not incon-
venient to commit unto memory fome-
thing concerning thofe perfons who prac-
tifed when firfl- I became a ftudent in

In Oftober 1633 my firfl: wife died,
and left me whatever was hers : it was
confiderable, very near to the value of
one thoufand pounds.
One whole year and more I continued
a widower, and followed my ftudies very
hard ; during which time a fcholar pawn-
ed unto me, for forty fhillings, Ars

and thofe prayers appropriated unto the
feveral angels.
I do ingenuoufly acknowledge* I ufed
thofe prayers according to the form and
direction prefcribed for forne weeks, ufing
the word aitrologia for aftronomia ; but of
this no more : That Ars Notoria, inferted
in the latter end of Cornelius Agrippa
fignifieth nothing ; many of the prayers
being not the fame, nor is the direction
to thefe prayers any thing confiderable.
In the year 1634, I taught Sir George
Peckham, Knight, aftrology, that part
which concerns ficknefs, wherein he fo
profited, that in two or three months he
would give a very true difcovery of any
difeafe, only by his figures : He praftifed
in Nottingham, but unfortunately died
in 1635, at St. Winifred's Well in Wales ;
in which well he continued fo long mum-
bling his Pater Nojlers and SanSia Wini-

of that well, nevef fpoke more.
In this year 1634, I purchafed the
moiety of thirteen houfes in the Strand
for five hundred and thirty pounds.
In November, the 18th day, I was
again the fecond time married, and had
five hundred pounds portion with that
wife; fhe was of the nature of Mars.

Two accidents happened to me in that
year fomethin-g memorable.
Davy Ramfey, his Majefty's clock-
maker, had been informed, that there
was a great quantity of treafure buried
in the cloyfter of Weftminfter-Abbey >
he acquaints Dean Williams therewith,
who was alfo then Biftiop of Lincoln
;
the Dean gave him liberty to fearch after
it, with this provifo, that if any was
difcovered, his church fhould have a
fhare of it. Davy Ramfey finds out one
John Scott, (a) who pretended the ufe of
the Mofaical rods, to affift him herein : I
was defired to join with him, unto which
I confented. One winter's night Davy
Ramfey, with feveral gentlemen, myfelf,
and Scott, entered the cloyfters ; we
played the hazel-rod round about the
cloyfter ; upon the weft-fide of the cloy-
fters the rods turned one over another,
an argument that the treafure was there
:
The labourers digged at leaft fix foot
deep, and then we met with a coffin ;
but in regard it was not heavy, we did
iiot open, which we afterwards much
repented : From the cloyfters we went
into the Abbey church, where, upon a
fudden, (there being no wind when we

began) fo fierce, fo high, fo Muttering
and loud a wind did rife, that we verily
believed the weft- end of the church would
have fallen upon us ; our rods would not
move at all ; the candles and torches, all
but one, were extinguifhed, or burned
very dimly : (a) John Scott, my partner,
was amazed, looked pale, knew not what
to think or do, until I gave directions
and command to difmifs the Daemons;
which when done, all was quiet again,
and each man returned unto his lodging
late, about twelve o'clock at night; I
could never fmce be induced to join with
any in fuch-like aftions.
The true mifcarriage of the bufmefs,
was by reafon of fo many people being
prefent at the operation ; for there was
above thirty, fome laughing, others de-
riding us ; fo that if we had not difmifTed
the Daemons, I believe moft part of the
Abbey church had been blown down;
fecrecy and intelligent operators, with a
ftrong confidence and knowledge of what
they are doing, are beft for this work.

upon I ordered fuch a day, fuch an hour

She obeyed; and when {he came to the

In the years 1637 and 1638, I had
great lawfuits both in the Exchequer and
Chancery, about a leafe I had of the an-
nual value of eighty pounds : I got the

In the year 1640 I inftructed John
Humphreys, mafter of that art, in the

being at London, by accident in Fleet-

Humphreys, who prefently enquired, if

told him I was willing to teach, but
would have one hundred pounds. I heard

I was the beft in England. Staying three
or four days in town, at laft we con-
tracted for forty pounds, for I could
never be quiet from his folicitations ; he
invited me to fupper, and before I had
fhewed him any thing, paid me thirty five
pounds. As we were at fupper a client

fufficiently enabled in aftrology as any
I could meet with, I made it my bufi-
nefs to repair thither ; and lb in Septem-
ber 1 641 I did; where, in the years
1642 and 1643, I had great leifure to
better my former knowledge : I then
read over all my books of aftrology, over
and over ; had very little or no practice
at all : And whereas formerly I could
never endure to read Valentine Naibod's
Commentary upon Alcabitius, now hav-
ing ferioufly ftudied him, I found him
to be the profoundeft author I ever met
with ; him I traverfed over day and night,
from whom I muft acknowledge to have
advanced my judgment and knowledge
unto that height I foon after arrived at,
or unto: A moft rational author, and
the fharpeft expofitor of Ptolomy that
hath yet appeared. To exercife my ge-
nius, I began to collect notes, and
thought of writing fome little thing
upon the 6 of T? and v then approach-
ing : I had not wrote above one fheet,
and that very meanly, but James Lord
Galloway came to fee me 3 and, by chance,

of it, yea, fo encouraged me to proceed

that method wherein it was printed 1

I do ferioufly now profefs, I had not the
afliftance of any perfon living, in the
writing or compofing thereof. Mr. Fifke
fent me a fmall manufcript which had
been Sir Chriftopher Heydon's, who
had wrote fomething of the conjuftion
of T? and 1603 ; out of which, to
bring my method in order, I tranferibed,
in the beginning, five or fix lines, and
not any more, though that gracelefs fel-
low Gadbury wrote the contrary ; but,
Seme/ & femper nebula & mendax. I did
formerly write one treatife, in the year
1639, upon the eclipfe of the fun, in the
nth degree of Gemini, 22 May 1639:
It confifted of fix fheets of paper. But
that manufcript I gave unto my moft
munificent patron, and ever bountiful
friend William Pennington, of Mun-
cafter in Cumberland, Efq; a wife and
excellently learned perfon * who, from
the year 1634, even till he died, conti-
nued unto me the moft grateful perfon I
ever was acquainted with. I became
acquainted with him by means of Davy
Ramfey.
Oh ! njoft noble Efquire, let me now
beg your pardon, if I digrefs for fome
fmall time, in commemorating his boun-

friendfhip, by performing many things
fuccefsfully for his advantage.
In 1639 he was made captain, and
ferved His Majefly in his then wars a-
gainft the Scots ; during which time a
farmer's daughter being delivered of a
baftard, and hearing, by report, that he
was flain, fathered the child upon him.
Shortly after he returned, moft woefully
vexed to be thus abufed, when abfent.
The woman was countenanced by fome
gentlemen of Cumberland, in this her
villany againft him ; fo that, notwith-
ftanding he had warrants to attach her
body, he could never difcover her : But
yet, hunting her from one place to ano-
ther, her friends thought it moft con-
venient to fend her to London, where
{he might be in moft fafety. She came
up to the city, and immediately I had
notice thereof, and the care of that mat-
ter left unto me. I procured the Lord
Chief Juftice Bramfton's warrant, and
had it lying dormant by me. She had
not been in the city above one fortnight,
but that I, going cafually to the clerk of
the affizes office for Cumberland, faw
there an handfome woman ; and hearing
of her fpeak the northern tone, I conr-
eluded the was the party I did fo want.
I rounded the clerk in his ear, and told
him I would give him five fhillings to
of his Life and Times. 57
hold the woman in chat till I came
again, for I had a writing concerned
her. I hafted for my warrant, and a
conftable, and returned into the office,
feized her perfon before the clerk of the
aflizes, who was very angry with me :
It was then feffions at Old-Bayley, and
neither Judge nor Juftice to be found.
At night we carried her before the Re-
corder, Gardner. It being Saturday at
night, fhe, having no bail, was fent to
Bridewell, where fhe remained till Mon-
day. On Monday morning, at the Old-
Bayley, fhe produced bail ; but I defiring
of the Recorder fome time to enquire
after the bail, whether they were fuffi-
cient, returned prefently, and told him
one of the bail was a prifoner in Lud-
gate, the other a very poor man : At
which he was fo vexed, that he fent her
to Newgate, where fhe lay all that week,
until fhe could pleafe me with good fure-
ties ; which then fhe did, and fo was
bound over to appear at the next aflizes
in Cumberland ; which fhe did, and was
there fentenced to be whipped, and im-
prifoned one whole year.
This aftion infinitely pleafed Mr. Pen-
nington, who thought I could do won-
ders y and I was moft thankfully requited
for it. All the while of this fcandalous
fcufmefs, do what he could, he could not
difcover
58 Mr. Lilly's History
difcover what perfons they were that fup-
ported her ; but the woman's father com-
ing to town, I became acquainted with
him, by the name of Mr. Sute, mer-
chant; invited him to a dinner; got
George Farmer with me; when we fo
plied him with wine, he could neither
fee or feel. I paid the reckoning, being
twenty two (hillings. But next morning
the poor man had never a writing or
letter in his pocket. I fent them down
to my friend, who thereby difcovered the
plots of feveral gentlemen in the bufinefs ;
after which, Mr. Sute returned tp his
pld name again.
Mr. Pennington was a true royalift,
whom Charles the Second made one of
his Commiffioners of Array for Cumber-
land. Having directions from me con-
tinually how matters did and would go
betwixt the King 'and Parliament, he
afted v^arily, and did but fign one only
warrant, of that nature, and then gave
over. When the times of fequeftrations
came, one John Mufgrave, the moft bold
and impudent fellow, and moft aftive of
all the north of England, and moft mali-
cious againft my friend, had got this
warrant under Mr. Pennington's hand
into his cuftody ; which affrighted my
friend, and fo it might, for it was caufe

Mufgrave being in London, by much
ado, I got acquainted with him, pretend-
ing myieif a bitter enemy againft Pen-
nington, whereat he very heartily re-
joiced ; and fo we appointed one night
to meet at the Five Bells, to compare
notes; for I pretended much. We did

the table all his papers, and withal, the

He was, befides, extreamly abufed by
one Ifaac Antrobus, parfon of Egremond,
a moft evil liver, bold, and very rich ; at
laft he procured a minifter of that coun-
try, in hope of the parfonage, to article
againft him in London, before the com-
mittee of plundered minifters. I was
once more invited to follicit againft An-
trobus, which I did upon three or more
articles.
I. That Antrobus baptized a cock, and
called him Peter.
II. He had knowledge of fuch a wo-
man and of her daughter, viz. of both
their bodies, in as large a manner as ever
of his own wife.
III. Being drunk, a woman took a cord
and tied it about his privy members unto
a manger in a ftable.
IV. Being a continual drunkard,

Antrobus was now become a great
champion for the Parliament ; but, at
the day of hearing, I had procured abun-
dance of my friends to be there ; for the
godly, as they termed themfelves, fided
with him ; the prefent Mafter of the Rolls
was Chairman that day, Sir Harbottle
Grimfton.

Who hearing the foulnefs of the caufe,
was very much afhamed thereof. I re-
member Antrobus, being there, pleaded
he was in his natural condition when he
acted fo ungracioufly.
'

who prefently,
before the committee, being fworn, made
it good, and named the place and ftreet
where he was drunk. So he was ad-
judged fcandalous, and outed of his be-
nefice, and our minifter had the parfo-
nage.
You cannot imagine how much the
routing of this drunken parfon pleafed
Mr. Pennington, who paid all charges
munificently and thankfully.
But now follows the laft and greateft
kindnefs I ever did him. Notwithftanding
the committee for fequeftrations in Cum-
berland were his very good friends, yet
the fub-fequeftrators, of their own heads,
62 Mr. Lilly's History
and without order, and by ftrength of
arms, fecured his iron, his wood, and
fo much of his perfonal eftate as was
valued at feven thoufand pounds. Now
had I complaint upon complaint : would
I fuffer my old friend to be thus abufed ?
it was in my power to free him from thefe
villains.
I hereupon advifed what was beft to
do, and was counfelled to get Mr. Speaker
Lenthall's letter to the fub-fequeftrators,
and command them to be obedient to the
committee of the county.
Whereupon, I framed a letter myfelf,
unto the fub-fequeftrators direfted, and
with it, myfelf and Mr. Laurence Mayd-
well (whom yourfelf well knew) went
to Mr. Speaker, unto whom we fuffi-
ciently related the ftubbornnefs of the
officers of Cumberland ; their difobedience
to the committee ; and then fhewed him
the letter, which when he had read
over, he moft courteoufly figned, adding
withal, that if they proceeded further in
fequeftring Mr. Pennington, he would
command a Serjeant at Arms to bring
them up to anfwer their contempts : I
immediately pofted that letter to my
friend, which when the abfurd fellows
received, they delivered him poffeflion of
his goods again; and, for my pains,
when he came to London, gave me one
hundred
of his Life and Times. $J
Ixundred pounds: He died in 1652, of a
violent fever. I did carefully, in 164a
and 1643, take notice of every grand
aÂ£tion which happened betwixt King and
Parliament, and did firft then incline to
believe, that as all fublunary affairs did
depend upon fuperior caufes, fo there
was a poffibility of difcovering them by
the configurations of the fuperior bodies ;
in which way making fome effays in thofe
two years, I found encouragement to
proceed further, which I did ; I perufed
the writings of the ancients, but therein
they were filent, or gave no fatisfaftion
;
at laft, I framed unto myfelf that me-
thod, which then and fince I follow,
which, I hope, in time may be more per-
fected by a more penetrating perfon than
myfelf.
In 1643, I became familiarly known to
Sir Bulftrode Whitlocke, a member of the
Houfe of Commons ; he being fick, his
urine was brought unto me by Mrs.
Lifle, (a) wife to John Lifle, afterwards
oiie of the keepers of the Great Seal j
(a) She was afterwards beheaded at Winchefter,
for harbouring one Nelthrop, a rebel in the Duke of
Monmouth's army 1685. She had made herfelf re-
markable, by faying at the martyrdom of King Charles
I. 1648, * that her blood leaped within her to fee the
4
tyrant fall for this, when me fell into the ftate trap,
fhe neither did nor could expect favour from any of that
martyr's family. D. N.
having
64 Mr. Lilly's History
having fet my figure, I returned anfwer,
the fick for that time would recover, but
by means of a furfeit would dangeroufly
relapfe within one month ; which he did,
by eating of trouts at Mr. Sand's houfe,
near Leatherhead in Surrey. Then I
went daily to vifit him, Dr. Prideau de-
fpairing of his life ; but I faid there was
no danger thereof, and that he would
be fufficiently well in five or fix weeks
;
and fo he was.
In 1644, I publifhed Merlinus Anglicus
Junior about April. I had given one day
the copy thereof unto the then Mr. Whit-
locke, who by accident was reading there-
of in the Houfe of Commons : ere the
Speaker took the chair, one looked upon
it, and fo did many, and got copies there-
of; which when I heard, I applied my-
felf to John Booker to licenfe it, for then
he was licenfer of all mathematical books ;
I had, to my knowledge, never feen him
before ; he wondered at the book, made
many impertinent obliterations, framed
many objections, fwore it was not pof-
fible to diftinguifh betwixt King and
Parliament; at laft licenfed it according
to his own fancy ; I delivered it unto the
printer, who being an arch Prefbyterian,
had five of the miniftry to infpeft it,
who could make nothing of it, but faid
it might be printed, for in that I meddled

not with their Dagon. The firft im-
preffion was fold in lefs than one week j
when I prefented fome to the members
of Parliament, I complained of John
Booker the licenfer, who had defaced my
book ; they gave me order forthwith to
reprint it as I would, and let them
know if any durfi: refift me in the re-
printing, or adding what I thought fit;
fo the fecond time it came forth as I would
have it*
I mull confefs, I now found my fcho-
lar Humphreys's words to be true con-
cerning John Booker, whom at that time
I found but moderately verfed in aftro-
logy; nor could he take the circles of
pofition of the planets, until in that
year I inftrufted him . After my Introduc-
tion in 1647 became publick, he amended
beyond meafure, by ftudy partly, and
partly upon emulation to keep up his
fame and reputation ; fo that fince 1

66 Mr. Lilly's History
In June 1644, I publifhed Supernatu-
ral Sight ; and, indeed, if I could have
procured the dull ftationer to have been
at charges to have cut the icon or form
of that prodigious apparition, as I had
drawn it forth, it would have given great
fatisfa6tion ; however, the aftrological
judgment thereupon had its full event in.
every particular.
That year alfo I publifhed the White
King's Prophecy, of which there were fold
in three days eighteen hundred, fo that
it was oft reprinted : I then made no
commentary upon it.
In that year I printed the Prophetical
Merlin, and had eight pounds for the
copy.
I had then no farther intention to trou-
ble the prefs any more, but Sir Richard
Napper having received one of Captain
Wharton's Almanacks for 1645, under
the name Naworth, he came unto me :
' Now, Lilly, you are met withal, lee
6
here what Naworth writes/ The words
were, he called me Â£
an impudent fenfe-
* lefs fellow, and by name William Lilly.*
Before that time, I was more Cavalier

but after that I engaged body and foul

and unto monarchy, which I ever loved
and approved beyond any government
whatfoever; and you will find in this
ftory many paffages of civility which I
did, and endeavoured to do, with the
hazard of my life, for his Majefty : But
God had ordered all his affairs and coun-
fels to have no fuccefTes ; as in the fequel
will appear.
To vindicate my reputation, and to
cry quittance with Naworth, againft
whom I was highly incenfed, to work
I went again for Anglicus 1645; which
as fooii as finifhed I got to the prefs,
thinking every day one month till it was
publick : I therein made ufe of the King's
nativity, and finding that his afdendant
was approaching to the quadrature of
Mars, about June 1645, I gave this un-
lucky judgment; ' If now we fight, a
* viftory ftealeth upon uÂ§V aiid fo it did
in June 1645, at Nafeby, the moft fatal
overthrow he ever had.
In this year 1645, I publifhed a trea-
tife call the Starry Meflenger, with an
interpretation of three funs feen in Lon-
don 29 May 1644, being Charles the
Second's birth - day : In that book I
alfo put forth an aftrological judgment
concerning the effefts of a folar eclipfe,
vifible the nth of Auguft 1645. Two
days before its publifhing, my antagonift,
F z Captain
68 Mr. Lilly's History
Captain Wharton, having given his aftro-
logical judgment upon his Majefty's pre-
fent march from Oxford j therein again fell
foul againft me and John Booker: Sir
Samuel Luke, Governor of Newport-
pagnel, had the thing came to his gar-
rifon from Oxford, which prefently was
prefented unto my view. I had but
twelve hours, or thereabout, to anfwer
it, which I did with fuch fuccefs as is
incredible; and the printer printed both
the March and my anfwer unto it,
and produced it to fight, with my Starry
Meflenger, which came forth and was
made publick the very day of the Parlia-
ment's great viftory obtained againft his
Majefty in perfon at Nafeby, under the
conduct of the Lord Thomas Fairfax.
That book no fooner appeared, but
within fourteen days complaint was made
to the committee of examinations, Miles
Corbet then being Chairman, my mor-
tal enemy, he who after was hanged,
drawn, and quartered, for being one of
the King's Judges ; he grants his war-
rant, and a meiienger to the Serjeant at
Arms feizeth my perfon. As I was going
to Weftminfter with the melTenger, I met
Sir Philip Stapleton, Sir Chriftopher Wray,
Mr. Denzil Hollis, Mr. Robert Reynolds,
who, by great fortune, had the Starry
Meiienger meet by fheet from me as it
came
of his Life and Times. 69
came from the prefs. They prefently fell
a fmiling at me ;
' Miles Corbel, Lilly,
f
will punifh thee foundly ; but fear no-
' thing, we will dine, and make hafte
' to be at the Committee time enough to do
' the bufmefs and fo they moft honour-
ably performed ; for they, as foon as they
came, fat down, and put Mr. Reynolds
purpofely into the chair, and I was called
in ; but Corbet being not there, they
bid me withdraw until he came ; which
when he did, I was commanded to ap-
pear, and Corbet defired to give the caufe
of my being in reftraint, and of the
Committee's order. Mr. Reynolds was
purpofely put into the chair, and con-
tinued till my bufinefc was over.
Corbet produced my Anglicus of 1645,
and faid there were many fcandalous
paflages therein againft the Commiffioners
of the Excife in London. He produced
one paffage, which being openly read by
himfelf, the whole committee adjudged it
to fignify the errors of fub-officers, but
had no relation to the Commiffioners
themfelves, which I affirmatively main-
tained to be the true meaning as the
committee declared.
Then Corbet found out another dan-
gerous place, as he thought, and the
words were thus in the printed book
â
' In the name of the Father, Son, and

Corbet very ignorantly read, ' will not

Committee fell heartily to laugh at him,
and fo he became filent.
There was a great many Parliament
men there ; the chamber was full. * Have

the chairman.
' Yes/ faith the Sollicitor for the Ex-
cife, ' fince his Starry Meffenger came

he fpoke to the Sollicitor. Then flood

I was ordered to withdraw, and by and

with a loud voice, < I was under a mef-
* fenger whereupon the Committee or-
dered him or the Serjeant at Arms not

Mr. Reynolds faying,
* Literate men never pay any fees/
But within one week after, I was likely
to have had worfe fuccefs, but that the
before-named gentlemen ftoutly befriend-
ed me. In my Epiftle of the Starry Mef-
fenger, I had been a little too plain with
the Committee of Leicefterfhire ; who
thereof made complaint unto Sir Arthur
Hazelrigg, Knight for that county ; he
was a furious perfon, and made a motion
in the Houfe of Commons againft me,
and the bulinefs was committed to that
Committee, whereof Baron Rigby was
Chairman. A day was affigned to hear
the matter ; in the morning whereof, as
I paffed by Mr. Pullen's fhop in St. Paul's
Church-yard, Pullen bad God be with
you, and named me by name. Mr. Sei-
dell being there, and hearing my name,
gave direction to call me unto him,
where he acquaints me with Hazelrigg's
humour and malice towards me, called
for the Starry Meflenger, and having
F 4 read
72 Mr. Lilly's History
read over the words mentioning that
Committee, he afked me how I would
anfwer them ? I related what I would
have faid, but he contradifted me, and
acquainted me what to fay, and how
to anfwer. In the afternoon I went to
appear, but there was no Committee
fet, or would fit ; for both Mr. Rey-
nolds and Sir Philip Stapleton, and my
other friends, had fully acquainted Baron
Rigby with the bufinefs, and defired not
to call upon me until they appeared
;
for the matter and charge intended againft
me was very frivolous, and only prefented
by a cholerick perfon to pleafe a com-
pany of clowns, meaning the Committee
of Leicefter. Baron Rigby faid, if it
were fo he would not meddle with the
matter, but exceedingly defired to fee me.
Not long after he met Sir Arthur, and
acquainting him what friends appeared
for me, faid, ' I will then profecute him
' no further/
All the ancient aftrologers of Eng-
land were much ftartled and confounded
at my manner of writing, efpecially old
Mr. William Hodges, who lived near
Wolverhampton in Staffordfhire, and
many others who underftood aftrology
competently well, as they thought. Hodges
fwore I did more by aftrology than he
could by the cryftal, and ufe thereof,
which
of his Life and Times. 73
which indeed he underftood as perfedlly
as any one in England. He was a great
royalift, but could never hit any thing
right for that party, though he much
defired it : He refolved queftions aftro-
logically ; nativities he meddled not with
;
in things of other nature, which required
more curiofity, he repaired to the cryf-
tal: His angels were Raphael, Gabriel,
and Uriel : his life anfwered not in ho-
linefs and fan&ity to what it ftiould,
having to deal with thofe holy angels*.
Being contemporary with me, I fhail re-
late what my partner John Scott, the
fame Scott as is before-mentioned, af-
firmed of him. John Scott was a little
fldlful in furgery and phyfick, fo was
Will Hocjges, and had formerly been a
fchool-mafter. Scott having fome occa-
fions into SUfFordfhire, addrefled himfelf
for a month or fix weeks to Hodges,
affifted him to drefs his patients, let
blood, &c. Being to return to London,
he defired Hodges to fhew him the per-
fon and feature of the woman he fhould
marry. Hodges carries him into a field
not far from his houfe, pulls out his
cryftal, bids Scott fet his foot to his,
and, after a while, wifhes him to infpett
the cryftal, and obferve what he faw
there. 1
I fee/ faith Scott, * a ruddy com-
< pjexioned wench in a red waiftcoat,
' drawing
74 Mr. Lilly's History
4
drawing a can of beer/ * She muft be
* your wife, ' faid Hodges. * You are
c
miftaken, Sir, '
faid Scott. 4
I am, fo
' foon as I come to London, to marry a
* tall gentlewoman in the Old-Bailey/
' You muft marry the red waiftcoat,' faid
Hodges. Scott leaves the country, comes
np to London, finds his gentlewoman
married : Two years after going into
Dover, in his return, he refrefhed him-
felf at an inn in Canterbury, and as he
came into the hall, or firft room thereof,
he miftook the room, and went into the
buttery, where he efpied a maid, defcribed
by Hodges, as before faid, drawing a
can of beer, &c. He then more nar-
rowly viewing her perfon and habit, found
her, in all parts, to be the fame Hodges
had defcribed ; after which he became a
fuitor unto her, and was married unto
her; which woman I have often feen.
This Scott related unto me feveral times,
being a very honeft perfon, and made
great confeience of what he fpoke. Ano-
ther ftory of him is as foiloweth, which
I had related from a perfon which well
knew the truth of it.
A neighbour gentleman of Hodges loft
his horfe; who having Hodges's advice
for recovery of him, did again obtain
him. Some years after, in a frolick, he
thought to abufe him, acquainting a
neighbour
of his Life and Times. 75
neighbour therewith, viz. That he had
formerly loft a horfe, went to Hodges,
recovered him again, but faith it was
by chance ; I might have had him with-
out going unto him :
c
Come, let's go, I
* will now put a trick upon him ; I will
* leave fome boy or other at the town's-
â¬
end with my horfe, and then go to Hodges
<
and enquire for him/ He did fo, gave
his horfe to a youth, with orders to
walk him till he returned. Away he
goes with his friend, falutes Mr. Hodges,
thanks him for his former courtefy, and
now defires the like, having loft a horfe
very lately. Hodges, after fome time of
paufing, faid; * Sir, your horfe is loft,
* and never to be recovered/ * I thought
' what fkill you had/ replies the gallant,
* my horfe is walking in a lane at the
' town's-end/ With that Hodges fwore
(as he was too much given unto that
vice) Â« your horfe is gone, and you will
f never have him again/ The gentleman
departed in great derifion of Hodges,
and went where he left his horfe 5 when
he came there, he found the boy faft
afleep upon the ground, the horfe gone,
the boy's arm in the bridle.
He returns again to Hodges, defiring
his aid, being forry for his former abufe.
Old Will fwore like a devil, * Be gone, be

ended not fo ; for the malicious man
brought Hodges into the ftar- chamber,
bound him over to the affizes, put Hodges
to great expences : but, by means of the
Lord Dudley, if I remember aright, or
fome other peffon thereabouts, he over-
came the gentleman, and was acquitted.
Befides this, a gentlewoman of my
acquaintance, and of credit, in Leicefter-
fhire, having loft a pillion-cloth, a very
new one, went to defire his judgment.
He ordered her fuch a day to attend at
Mountforrel in Leicefterfhire, and about
twelve o'clock fhe fhould fee her pillion-
cloth upon a horfe, and a woman upon
it. My friend attended the hour and
place ; it being told, fhe muft needs
warm herfelf well, and then enquired if
any paffengers had lately gone by the inn ?
Unto whom anfwer was made, there
pafTed by whilft fhe was at the fire, about
naif an hour before, a man, and a wo-
man behind him, on horfe- back. Inquir-
ing of what colour the pillion-cloth was
of , it was anfwered, direfrly of the colour
my friend's was : They purfued, but too
late.
In thofe times, there lived one William
Marfh in Dunftable, a man of godly life
and upright converfation, a Recufant. By
aftrology he refolved thievifh queftions
with great fuccefs ; that was his utmoft
fole
of his Life and Times. 77
fole practice. He was many times in
trouble ; but by Dr. Napper's intereft with
the Earl of Bolingbroke, LordWentworth,
after Earl of Cleveland, he ftill conti-
nued his praftice, the faid Earl not per-
mitting any Juftice of Peace to vex him.
This man had only two books, Guido
and Haly bound together : He had fo
mumbled and tumbled the leaves of both,
that half one fide of every leaf was torn
even to the middle, I was familiar with
him for many years : He died about
1647.
A word or two of Dr. Napper, who
lived at Great Lindford in Buckingham-
fliire, was parfon, and had the advowfon
thereof. He defcended of worfhipful pa-
rents, and this you muft believe ; for when
Dr. Napper's brother, Sir Robert Nap-
per, a Turkey merchant, was to be made
a Baronet in King James's reign, there
was fome difpute whether he could prove
himfelf a gentleman far three or more
defcents. * By my faul/ faith King James,
* I will certify for Napper, that he is of
* above three hundred years {landing in
* his family, all of them, by my faul,
* gentlemen,' &c. However, their family
came into England in King Henry the
Eighth's time. The parfon was Mafter of
Arts ; but whether doftorated by degree
or courtefy, becaufe of his profeffion, I
know
yS Mr. Lilly's History
know not. Mifcarrying one day in the
pulpit, he never after ufed it, but all
his life-time kept in his houfe fome ex-
cellent fcholar or other to officiate for
him, with allowance of a good falary
:
He out-went Forman in phyfick and
holinefs of life ; cured the falling-fick-
nefs perfeftly by conftellated rings, fome
difeafes by amulets, &c.
A maid was much afflifted with the
falling-ficknefs, whofe parents applied
themfelves unto him for cure : he framed
her a conftellated ring, upon wearing
whereof, fhe recovered perfeftly. Her
parents acquainted fome fcrupulous divines
with the cure of their daughter :
* The
* cure is done by inchantment,' fay they.
* Caft away the ring, it's diabolical ; God
* cannot blefs you, if you do not caft the
* ring away.' The ring was caft into the
well, whereupon the maid became epi-
leptical as formerly, and endured much
mifery for a long time. At laft her
parents cleanfed the well, and recovered
the ring again ; the maid wore it, and
her fits took her no more. In this con-
dition fhe was one year or two ; which
the Puritan minifters there adjoining hear-
ing, never left off, till they procured her
parents to caft the ring quite away
;
which done, the fits returned in fuch
violence, that they were enforced to ap-
ply

ply to the Doftor again, relating at
large the whole ftory, humbly imploring
his once more affiftance ; but he could
not be procured to do any thing, only
faid, thofe who defpifed God's mercies,
were not capable or worthy of enjoying
them.
I was with him in 1632, or 1633, upon
occafion. He had me up into his library,
being excellently furnifhed with very
choice books : there he prayed almoft
one hour he invocated feveral angels in
his prayer, viz. {a) Michael, Gabriel,
Raphael, Uriel, &c. We parted.
He inftrufted many minifters in aftro-
logy, would lend them whole cloak-bags
of books; prote&ed them from harm
and violence, by means of his power with
the Earl of (b) Bolingbroke. He would
confefs my mafter Evans knew more than
himfelf in fome things : and fome time
before he died, he got his coufin Sir
Richard to fet a figure to fee when he
fhould die. Being brought him ;

of phyfick in Northampton, wrote a
fliarp book of witchcraft, wherein, ob-
liquely, he bitterly inveighed againft the
Doctor.
In 1646, I printed a colleftionof Pro-
phecies, with the explanation and verifi-
cation of Aquila, or the White King's
Prophecy ; as alfo the nativities of Bifhop
Laud and Thomas Earl of Strafford, and
a moft learned fpeech by him intended
to have been fpoke upon the fcaffold.
In this year 1646, after a great confi-
deration, and many importunities, I be-
gan to fix upon thoughts of an Intro-
duction unto Aftrology, which was very
much wanting, and as earneftly longed for
by many perfons of quality, fomething
alfo much occafioned and haftened the
impreffion, viz. the malevolent barking
of Prefbyterian minifters in their weekly
fermons, reviling the profeflbrs thereof,
and myfelf particularly by name.
Secondly, I thought it a duty incum-
bent upon me, to fatisfy the whole king-
dom of the lawfulnefs thereof, by fram-
ing a plain and eafy method for any
perfon but of indifferent capacity to learn
the art, and inftruft himfelf therein,
without any other matter than my In-
trodudlion ; by which means, when many
underftood it, I fhould have more partners
of his Life and Times. 8i
and afliftants to contradict all and every
antagonift.
Thirdly, I found it beft as unto point
of time, becaufe many of the foldiers
were wholly for it, and many of the In-
dependant party ; and I had abundance
of worthy men in the Houfe of Com-
mons, my affured friends, no lovers of
Prefbytery, which then were in great
efteem, and able to proteft the art ; for
fhould the Prefbyterian party have pre-
vailed, as they thought of nothing lefs
than to be Lords of all, I knew well they
would have filenced my pen annually,
and committed the Introduftion unto
everlafting filence.
Fourthly, I had fomething of con-
fcience touched my fpirit, and much ele-
vated my conceptions, believing God had
not beftowed thofe abilities upon me, to
bury them under a bufhel; for though
my education was very mean, yet, by
my continual induftry, and God s great
mercy, I found myfelf capable to go for-
ward with the work, and to commit the
iffue thereof unto divine providence*
I had a hard tafk in hand to begin the
firft part hereof, and much labour I un-
derwent to methodize it as it is.
I ingenuoully confefs unto you (Arts'
great Meoenas, noble Efquire Afhmole,)

compofition or ordering of the firft part
thereof, but my one only felf. You are
a perfon of great reading, yet I well
know you never found the leaft trace
thereof in any author yet extant.
In compofing, contriving, ordering,
and framing thereof (viz. the firft part)
a great part of that year was fpent. I
again perufed all, or moft, authors I
had, fometimes adding, at other times
diminifhing, until at laft I thought it
worthy of the prefs. When I came to
frame the fecond part thereof, having for-
merly collected out of many manufcripts,
and exchanged rules with the moft able
profeflbrs I had acquaintance with, in
tranferibing thofe papers for impreflion,
I found, upon a ftrift inquifition, thofe
rules were, for the moft part, defective
;
fo that once more I had now a difficult
labour to correft their deficiencv, to new
reftify them according to art ; and laftly,
confidering the multiplicity of daily ques-
tions propounded unto me, it was as hard
a labour as might be to tranferibe the
papers themfelves with my own hand.
The defire I had to benefit pofterity and
my country, at laft overcame all difficul -
ties ; fo that what I could not do in one
year, I perfected early the next year,
16475 and then in that year, viz. 1647,
I finiftied
of his Life and Times. 83
I finifhed the third book of {a) nativities,
(6) during the compofing whereof, for
(even whole weeks, I was fliut up of the
plague, burying in that time two maid-
servants thereof; yet towards November
that year, the Introduction, called by the
name of Chriftian Aftrology was made
publick. There being, in thofe times,
fome fmart difference between the army
and the Parliament, the head -quarters
of the army were at Windfor, whither I
was carried with a coach and four horfes,
and John Booker with me. We were
welcome thither, and feafted in a gar-
den where General Fairfax lodged. We
were brought to the General, who bid
us kindly welcome to Windfor ; and, in
effeft, faid thus much :
' That God had bleffed the army with
' many fignal viftories, and yet their work
* was not finifhed. He hoped God would
* go along with them until his work was
' done. They fought not themfelves, but
* the welfare and tranquillity of the good
' people, and whole nation ; and, for
< that end, were refolved to facrifice both
' their lives and their own fortunes. As

his fpeech I prefently made this reply
:
* My Lord, I am glad to fee you here

at this time.

4
and all others of this nation, are very

the great work for which he ordained

This ended, we departed, and went to
vifit Mr. Peters the minifter, who lodged
in the caftle, whom we found reading an
idle pamphlet come from London that
morning. * Lilly, thou art herein,' fays
he. * Are not you there alfo ?' I replied.
' Yes, that I am,' quoth he. -The
words concerning me, were thefe
:
From th' oracles of the Sibyls fo filly,
The curfi: predictions of William Lilly,
And Dr. Sybbald's Shoe-lane Philly,
Good Lord, deliver me.
After much conference with Hugh
Peters, and fome private difcourfe betwixt
us two, not to be divulged, we parted,
and fo came back to London.
King Charles the Firft, in the year
1646, April 27, went unto the Scots,
then in this nation. Many defired my
judgment, in time of his abfence, to
difcover the way he might be taken : which
I would never be drawn unto, or give any
direction concerning his perfon.
There were many lewd Mercuries printed
both in London and Oxford, wherein I
was fufficiently abufed, in this year 1646.
I had then my afcendant ad <s , and C
ad praprium. The Prefbyterians were, in
G 7 their
86 Mr. Lilly's History
their pulpits, as mercilefs as the Cavaliers
in their pamphlets.
About this time, the moft famous
mathematician of all Europe, (a) Mr.
William Oughtred, parfon of Aldbury in
Surrey, was in danger of fequeftration
by the Committee of or for plundered
minifters; (Ambo-dexters they were;)
feveral inconfiderable articles were depofed
and fworn againft him, material enough
to have fequeftered him, but that, upon
his day of hearing, I applied myfelf to
Sir Bolftrode Whitlock, and all my own
old friends, who in fuch numbers ap-
peared in his behalf, that though the
chairman and many other Prefbyterian
members were ftiff againft him, yet he
was cleared by the major number. The
truth is, he had a considerable parfonage,
and that only was enough to fequefter any
moderate judgment: He was alfQ well
known to afFeft his Majefty. In thefe
times many worthy minifters loft their
livings or benefices, for not complying
with the Three-penny Directory. Had
you feen (O noble Efquire) what pitiful
ideots were preferred into fequeftrated
church-benefices, you would have been
grieved in your foul ; but when they
came before the claffis of divines, could

thofe fimpletons but only fay, they were
converted by hearing fuch a fermon, fuch
a lecture, of that godly man Htigh Peters,
Stephen Marfhall, or any of that gang,
he was prefently admitted.
In 1647, I publifhed the World's Ca-
taftrophe, the Prophecies of Ambrofe
Merlin, with the Key wherewith to un-
lock thofe obftrufe Prophecies alfo Tri-
themius of the Government of the World
by the prefiding Angels ; thefe came forth
all in one book.
The two firft were exquifitely tranflated
by yourfelf, (moft learned Sir) as I do in-
genuoufly acknowledge in my Epiftle unto
the Reader, with a true character of the
worth and admirable parts, unto which
I refer any that do defire to read you
perfectly delineated. I was once refolved
to have continued Trithemius for fome
fucceeding years, but multiplicity of em-
ployment impeded me. The ftudy required,
in that kind of learning, muft be feden-
tary, of great reading, found judgment,
which no man can accomplifh except
he wholly retire, ufe prayer, and accom-
pany himfelf with angelical conforts.
His Majefty Charles the Firft, having
entrufted the Scots with his perfon, was,
for money, delivered into the hands of
the Englifh Parliament, and, by feveral
removals, was had to Hampton-Court
about July or Auguft 1647; for he was
G 4 there,
88 Mr. Lilly's History
there, and at that time when my houfe
was vifited with the plague. He was
defirous to efcape from the foldiery, and
to obfcure himfelf for fome time near
London, the citizens whereof began now
to be unruly, and alienated in affeftion
from the Parliament, inclining wholly
to his Majefty, and very averfe to the
army. His Majefty was well informed
of all this, and thought to make good
ufe hereof -
y befides, the army and Parlia-
ment were at fome odds, who fhould
be matters. Upon the King's intention
to efcape, and with his confent, Madam
Whorewood (whom you knew very well,
worthy Efquire) came to receive my judg-
ment, im. In what quarter of this na-
tion he might be moft fafe, and not to
be difcovered until himfelf pleafed.
When fhe came to my door, I told
her I would not let her come into my
houfe, for I buried a maid-lervant of the
plague very lately, f I fear not the plague,
* but the pox,' quoth fhe; fo up we
went. After ereftion of my figure, I
told her about twenty miles (or there-
abouts) from London, and in EfTex, I
was certain he might continue undif-
covered. She liked my judgment very
well ; and, being herfelf of a iharp judg-
ment, remembered a place in Efiex about
that diftance, where was an excellent
houfe, and all conveniences for his re-
ception.

ception. Away fhe went, early next
morning, unto Hampton-Court, to ac-
quaint his Majefty; but fee the misfor-
tune : He, either guided by his own ap-
proaching hard fate, or mifguided by (a)
Afhburnham, went away in the night-
time weftward, and furrendered himfelf
to Hammond, in the Ifle of Wight.
Whilft his Majefty was at Hampton-
Court, Alderman Adams fent his Majefty
one thoufand pounds in gold, five hun-
dred whereof he gave to Madam Whore-
wood. I believe I had twenty pieces of
that very gold for my fhare.
I have fomething more to write of
Charles the Firft's misfortunes, wherein
I was concerned ; the matter happened in
1648, but I thought good to infert it
here, having after this no more occafion
to mention him.
His Majefty being in Carifbrook-Caftle
in the Ifle of Wight, the Kentifh men,
in great numbers, rofe in arms, and joined
with the Lord Goring ; a confiderable
number of the beft fhips revolted from
the Parliament ; the citizens of London
were forward to rife againft the Parlia-
ment j his Majefty laid his defign to efcape

out
90 Mr. Lilly's History
out of prifon, by fawing the iron bars of
his chamber window ; a fmall fhip was
provided, and anchored not far from the
caftle to bring him into Suffex; horfes
were provided ready to carry him through
Suflex into Kent, that fo he might be
at the head of the army in Kent, and
from thence to march immediately to
London, where thoufands then would
have armed for him. The Lady Whore-
wood came to me, acquaints me herewith.
I got G. Farmer (who was a raoft inge-
nious lock-fmith, and dwelt in Bow-lane)
to make a faw to cut the iron bars iu
funder, I mean to faw them, and aqua
fortis befides. His Majefty in a fmall
time did his work ; the bars gave liberty
for him to go out ; he was out with his
body till he came to his breaft ; but then
his heart failing, he proceeded no farther :
when this was difcovered, as foon after
it was, he was narrowly looked after, and
no opportunity after that could be devifed
to enlarge him. About September the
Parliament fent their CommiHioners with
propofitions unto him into the Ifle of
Wight, the Lord William Sea being one
;
the Lady Whorewood comes again unto
me from him or by his confent, to be
directed : After perufal of my figure, I
told her the Commiifioners would be there
fuch a day; I ele&ed a day and hour
when
of his Life and Times. 91
when to receive the Commiffioners and
propofitions -
y and as foon as the propo-
fitions were read, to fign them, and
make hafte with all fpeed to come up with
the Commiffioners to London. The army
being then far diftant from London, and
the city enraged ftoutly againft them, he
promifed he would do fo. That night
the Commiffioners came, and old Sea and
his Majefty had private conference till one
in the morning : the King acquaints Sea
with his intention, who clearly diflwaded
him from figning the propofitions, telling
him they were not fit for him to fign
;
that he had many friends in the Houfe of
Lords, and fome in the Houfe of Com-
mons ; that he would procure more, and
then they would frame more eafy pro-
pofitions. This flattery of this unfortu-
nate Lord, occafioned his Majefty to wave
the advice I and fome others that wifhed
his profperity had given, in expectation
of that which afterwards could never be
gained. The army having fome notice
hereof from one of the Commiffioners,
who had an eye upon old Sea, hafted
unto London, and made the citizens very
quiet; and befides, the Parliament and
army kept a better correfpondency after-
wards with each other.
Whilft the King was at Windfor-Caftle,
one walking upon the leads there, he
looked
92 Mr. Lilly's History
looked upon Captain Wharton's Alma-
nack ;

' and that Lilly underftands aftrology as
' well as any man in Europe.' Exit Rex
Carolus.
In 1648 I publifhed a Treatife of the
three Suns, feen the winter preceding
;
as alfo an Aftrological Judgment upon a
Conjun&ion of Saturn and Mars 28 June,
in 1 1 degrees 8 minutes of Gemini.
I commend unto your perufal that book
and the Prophetical Merlin, which feri-
oufly confidered, (Oh worthy Efquire)
will more inftruft your judgment \De
generalibiis contingentibas Mundi) than all
the authors you yet ever met with.
In this year, for very great confidera-
tions, the Counfel of State gave me in
money fifty pounds, and a penfion of
one hundred pounds per Annum, which
for two years I received, but no more :
upon fome difcontents I after would not

was this ; they could get no intelligence
out of France, although they had feve-
ral agents there for that purpofe. I had
formerly acquaintance with a fecular prieft,
at this time confefibr to one of the Secre-
taries ; unto him I wrote, and by that
means had perfeft knowledge of the
chiefeft concernments of France, at which
they admired ; but I never yet, until this
day, revealed the name of the perfon.
One occafion why I deferted that em-
ployment was, becaufe Scott, who had
eight hundred pounds per A?inum for in-
telligence, would not contribute any oc-
cafion to gratify my friend : And another
thing was, I received fome affront from
Gualter Front their Secretary, one that
was a principal minifter belonging to the
Council of State. Scott was ever my
enemy, the other knave died of a gan-
grene in his arm fuddenly after.
In 1648 and 1649, that I might en-
courage young ftudents in aftrology, I
pubfickly read over the firft part of my
Introduction, wherein there are many
things contained, not eafily to be under-
ftood.
And now we are entered into the year
1649: his Majefty being at St. James's
Houfe, in January of that year, I begun
its obfervations thus
:

furers, and fuch like officers. I had not
then heard the leaft intimation of bring-
ing the King unto trial, and yet the firft
day thereof I was cafualiy there, it being
upon a Saturday 5 for going to Weftmin-
fter every Saturday in the afternoon, in
thefe times, at Wjiite-hall I cafualiy met
Peters ; ' Come, Lilly, wilt thou go hear
Â« the King tried ?' < When?' faid I. < Now,

was permitted by the guard of foldiers to
pafs up to the King's-Bench. Within one
quarter of an hour came the Judges,
prefently his Majefty, who fpoke excel-
lently well, and majeftically, without im-
pediment in the leaft when he fpoke. I
faw the filver top of his ftaff unexpectedly
fall to the ground, which was took up by
Mr. Rufhworth : but when I heard Brad-
fhaw the Judge fay to his Majefty,
* Sir, inftead of anfwering the court,
* you interrogate their power, which be-
* comes not one in your condition/
Thefe words pierced my heart and foul,
to hear a fubjeft thus audacioufly to re-
prehend his Sovereign, who ever and
anon replied with great magnanimity and
prudence.
After that his Majefty was beheaded,
the Parliament for fome ye^rs afFetted

tranquillity of the nation, or fettling re-
ligion as they had formerly promifed.
The interval of time betwixt his Majefty's
death and Oliver Cromwell's difplacing
them, was wholly confumed in voting for
themfelves, and bringing their own re-
lations to be members of Parliament,
thinking to make a trade thereof.
The week, or three or four days before
his Majefty's beheading, one Major Syden-
ham, who had commands in Scotland,
came to take his leave of me, and told
me the King was to be put to death,
which I was not willing to believe, and
faid, ' I could not be perfuaded the Par-
* liament could find any Englifhman fo
* barbarous, that would do that foul
< a&ion/ ' Rather/ faith he, < than they

fhould want fuch a man, thefe arms

and his body miferably cut and mangled.
In 1 65 1 I publilhed Monarchy or no

I had not that learning from books,
or any manufcript I ever yet met withal^
it is reduced from a cabal lodging in aftro-
logy, but fo myfterious and difficult to
be attained, that I hive not yet been ac-
quainted with any who had that know-
ledge. I will fay no more thereof, but
that the afterifms and figns and conftel-
lations give greateft light thereunto.
During Bradfhaw's being Prefident of
the Council of State, it was my happi-
nefs to procure Captain Wharton his
liberty, which when Bradfhaw underftood,
faid, * I will be an enemy to Lilly, if ever
* he come before me.' Sir Bolftrode Whit-J
lock broke the ice firft of all on behalf
of Captain Wharton : after him the Com-
mittee, unto whom his offence had been
committed, fpoke for him, and faid he
might well be bailed or enlarged : I had
fpokeri to the Committee the morning
of his delivery, who thereupon were fo
civil unto him, efpecially Sir William
Ermin of Lincolnfliire. who at firft won-
dered I appeared not againft him * but
upoti my humble requeft; my long con-
tinued antagonift was enlarged and had
his liberty.
In 1 65 1 I purehafed one hundred and
ten pounds per Aiinum in fee-farm rents
for one thoufand and thirty pounds. I
paid all in ready money ; but when hii
98 Mr. Lilly's Histo&V
Majefty King Charles the Second, 1660,-
was reftored, I loft it all again, and it
returned to the right owner ; the lofs
thereof never affli&ed me, for I have
ever reduced niy mind according to my
fortune. I was drawn in by feveral per-
fons to make that fimple purchafe. The
year I bought it, I had my ascendant
directed into a Trine of Jupiter firft, and
in the fame year into the Cauda Draconis
âmy fortune into a quadrant of Mer-
cury, When Colchefter was befieged,
John Booker arid myfelf were fent for,
where we encouraged the foldiers, allur-
ing them the town wr
ould very fhortly be
furrendered, as indeed it was : I would
willingly have obtained leave to enter the
town, to have informed Sir Charles Lucas,
whom I well knew, with the condition of
affairs as they then ftood, he being de-
luded by falfe intelligence : at that time
my fcholar Humphreys was therein, who
many times deluded the Governor with
expe&ation of relief; but failing very
many times with his lies, at lafl he had
the baftinado, was put in prifon, and in-
forced to become a foldier; and well it
was he efcaped fo. âDuring my being
there, the fteeple of St. Mary's Church
was much battered by two cannons pur-
pofely placed : I was there one day about
three of the clock in the afternoon, talk-
ing

ing with the cannoneer, when prefently he
defired us to look to ourfelves, for he
perceived by his perfpeftive glafs there was
a piece charged in the caftle againft his
work, and ready to be difcharged. I ran
for hafte under an old afh-tree, and im-
mediately the cannon-bullet came hiffing
quite over us. * No danger now/ faith
the gunner, * but begone, for there are
* five more charging/ which was true
;
for two hours after thofe cannons were
difcharged, and unluckily killed our
cannoneer and matrofs. I came the next
morning and faw the blood of the two
poor men lie upon the planks : we were
well entertained at the head quarters, and
after two whole days abiding there, came
for London.
Bat we profecute our ftory again, and
fay that in the year 1652 I purchafed my
houfe and fome lands in Herfham, in the
parifh of Walton upon Thames, in the
county of Surrey, where I now live; in-
tending by the bleffing of God, when I
found it convenient, to retire into the
country, there to end my days in peace
and tranquillity ; for in London my prac-
tice was fuch, I had none or very little
time afforded me to ferve God, who
had been fo gracious unto me. The
purchafe of the houfe and lands, and
building, flood me in nine hundred and

fifty pounds fterling, which I have very
much augmented.
The Parliament now grows odious unto
all good men, the members whereof be-
came infufferable in their pride, covet-
oufnefs, felf-ends, lazinefs, minding no-
thing but how to enrich themfelves. Much
heart-burning now arofe betwixt the Pref-
byterian and Independant, the latter Tid-
ing with the army, betwixt whofe two
judgments there was no medium. Now
came up, or firft appeared, that mon-
itrous people called Ranters : and many
other novel opinions in themfelves here-
tical and fcandalous, were countenanced
by members of Parliament, many where-
of were of the fame judgment. Juftice
was neglected, vice countenanced, and
all care of the common good laid afide.
Every judgment almoft groaned under the
heavy burthen they then fuffered ; the
army negle&ed; the city of London
fcorned -
y the miniftry, efpecially thofe who
were orthodox and ferious, honeft or vir-
tuous, had no countenance ; my foul be-
gan to loath the very name of a Parlia-
ment, or Parliament-men. There yet re-
mained in the Houfe very able, judici-
ous, and worthy patriots ; but they, by
their filence, only ferved themfelves : all
was carried on by a rabble of dunces,
who being the greater number, voted
what
of his Life and Times. iof
what feemed beft to their nonintelligent
fancies.
In this year I publifhed Annus Tene-
brofus, which book I did not fo entitle,
becaufe of the great obfcurity of the folar
eclipfe, by fo many prattled of to no
purpofe, but becaufe of thofe underhand
and clandeftine counfels held in England
by the foldiery, of which I would never,
but in generals, give any knowledge unto
any Parliamant man. I had wrote pub-
lickly in 1650, that the Parliament fhould
not continue, but a new government
ihould arife, &c.
In my next year's Anglicus, upon ra-
tional grounds in aftrology, I was fo
bold as to aver therein, that the Parlia-
ment flood upon a tottering foundation,
and that the commonalty and foldiery
would join together againft them.
My Anglicus was for a whole week
every day in the Parliament Houfe, peep-
ed into by the PrenSyterians, one difliking
this fentence, another finds another fault,
others mifliked the whole ; fo in the end
a motion was made, that Anglicus fhould
be infpefted by the Committee for plun-
dered minifters ; which being done, they
were to return them to the Houfe, viz.
report its errors.
A meffenger attached me by A warrant
from that Committee; I had private
H 3 notice
102 Mr. Lilly's History
notice ere the meflenger came, and hafted
unto Mr. Speaker Lenthall, ever my
friend. He was exceeding glad to fee me,
told me what was done ; called for Angli-
cus, marked the paffages which tormented
the Prefbyterians fo highly. I prefently
fent for Mr. Warren the printer, an af-
fured Cavalier, obliterated what was moft
offenfive, put in other more fignificant
words, and (Jefired only to have fix a-
mended againft next morning, which very
honeftly he brought me. I told him my
defign was to deny the book found fault
with, to own only the fix books. I tojd
him, I doubted he would be examined.
â¬
Hang them/ faid he, * they are all

rogues. I'll fwear myfelf to the devil
c
ere they fhall have an advantage againft
* you by my oath/
The day after, I appeared before the
Committee, being thirty fix in number
that day ; whereas it was obferved, at o-
ther times, it was very difficult to get
five of them together, At firft they
fhewed me the true Anglicus, and alked
if I wrote and printed it. I took the
book and infpe&ed it very heedfully;
and, when I had done fo, faid thus :
' This is none of rny book, fome ma-
<
Hcious Prefbyterian hath wrote it, whQ
* are my mortal enemies ; I difown it/
The Committee looked upon one ano-
ther
of his Life and Times, 103
ther like diftracted men, not imagining
what I prefently did ; for I prefently
pulled out of my pocket fix books, and
(aid, ' Thefe I own, the others are coun-
* terfeits, publifhed purpofely to ruin me/
The Committee were now more vexed
than before : Not one word was fpoke a
good while; at laft, many of them, or
the greateft number of them, were of
opinion to imprifon me. Some were for
Newgate, others for the Gate-Houfe;
but then one Bro\yn of Suflex, called
the Prefbyterian beadje, vwhom the com-
pany of Stationers had bribed to be my
friend, by giving him a new book of
Martyrs ; he, I fay, preached unto the
Committee this doctrine, that neither
Newgate or the Gate-Houfe were prifons
unto which at any time the Parliament
fent prifoners : it was moft convenient
for the Serjeant at Arms to take me in
cuftody.
Mr. Strickland, who had for many
years been the Parliament's Amballador
or Agent in Holland, when he law how
they inclined, fpoke thus :
(
I came purpofely into the Committee
* this day to fee the man who is fo fa-
' mous in thofe parts where I have fo
f long continued : I allure you his name
* is famous all over Europe : I come to

t us, and faid to be his he denies it ;
* we have not proved it, yet will commit
' him. Truly this is great injuftice. It
f is likely he will write next year, and
' acquaint the whole world with our in-
f jufticg ; and fo well he may. It is my
f opinion, firft to prove the book to be
f his, ere he be committed/
Another old friend of mine, Mr. R.
fpoke thus
:
* Yqu do not know the many fervices
f this man hath done for the Parliament
* thefe many years, or how many times,
* in our greateft diftrefles, we applying
* unto him, he hath refrefhed our lan-r

* kept up the fpirits both of the foldiery,
t the honeft people of this nation, and
t many Qf us Parliament men ; and now
* at laft, for a flip of his pen (if it were
4
his) to be thus violent againft him : I
4
muft tell you, I fear the confequence
'
urged out of the book will prove ef-
* fe&ually true. It is my counfel, to
f admonifh him hereafter to be more
* wary, and fqr the prefent to difmifs
! him/
Notwithftanding any thing that was
fpoken on my behalf, I was ordered to
ftand committed to the Serjeant at Arms.
of his Life and Times. 105
The meffenger attached my perfon, faid I
was his prifoner. As he was carrying
me away, he was called to bring me
again. Oliver Cromwell, Lieutenant-
General of the army, having never feen
me, caufed me to be produced again,
where he ftedfaftly beheld me for a good
fpace, and then I went with the meffen-
ger ; but inftantly a young clerk of that
Committee afks the meffenger what he
did with me, where's the warrant ? un-
til that is figned you cannot feize Mr^
Lilly, or fhall. Will you have an aftion
of falfe imprifonment againft you ? So I
efcaped that night, but next day obeyed
the warrant. That night Oliver Crom-
well went to Mr. R. my friend, and faid,
* What never a man to take Lilly's caufe
4
in hand but yourfelf ? None to take his
' part but you ? He fhall not be long there.*
Hugh Peters fpoke much in my behalf
to the Committee ; but they were refolved
to lodge me in the Serjeant's cuftody.
One Millington, a drunken member, was
much my enemy ; and fo was Cawley and
Chichefter, a deformed fellow, \mto whom
I had done feveral courtefie-s.
Firft thirteen days I was a prifoner;
and though every day of the Committee's
fitting I had a petition to deliver, yet
fo many churlifh Prefbyterians ftill ap-
peared/ I could not get it accepted. The
laft
jp6 Mr. Lilly's History
laft day of the thirteen, Mr. Jofeph Afh
was made Chairman, unto whom my
caufe being related, he took my petition,
and faid I fhould be bailed in defpite
of them all, but defired I would procure
as many friends as I could to be there.
Sir Arthur Hazelrigg, and Major Sallo-
way, a perfon of excellent parts, ap-
peared for me, and many now of my old
friends came in. After two whole hours
arguing of my caufe by Sir Arthur and
Major Salloway, and other frienda, the
matter came to this point; I fhould be
bailed, and a Committee nominated to
examine the printer. The order of the
Committee being brought afterwards to
him who fhould be Chairman, he fent
me word, do what I would, he would fee
all the knaves hanged, ere he would ex-
amine the printer. This is the truth of
the flory.
The 1 6th of February myfecon4

her as a portion, but fhe and her poor
relations fpent me one thoufand pounds.

In the time of my imprifonment, Mr,
Rufhworth came to vifit me, and told
me, the army would do as much as I had
predicted unto the Parliament.
In Oftober 1654, I married the third
wife, who is fignified in my nativity by
Jupiter in Libra ; and fhe is fo totally in
jier conditions, to my great comfort.
In 1655, I was indifted at Hicks's-HalJ
by a half-witted young woman. Three
feveral Seffions fhe was negleCted, and the
Jury caft forth her bill ; but the fourth,
time, they found it againft me : I put
in bail to traverfe the indictment. The
caufe of the indiftment was, for that I
had given judgment upon ftolen goods,
and received two (hillings and fix pence.
1
âAnd this was faid to be contrary unto
an Aft in King James's time made.
This mad woman was put upon this
aftion againft me by two minifters, who
had
io8 Mr. Lilly's History
had framed for her a very ingenious fpeech,
which fhe could fpeak without book, as
lhe did the day of hearing the traverfe.
She produced one woman, who told the
court, a fon of hers was run from her
;
that being in much affli&ion of mind for
her lofs, fhe repaired unto me to know
what was become of him; that I told
her he was gone for the Barbadoes, and
fhe would hear of him within thirteen
days ; which, fhe faid, fhe did.
A fecond woman made oath, that her
hufband being wanting two years, fhe
repaired to me for advice : That I told
her he was in Ireland, and would be at
home fuch a time ; and, faid fhe, he did
come home accordingly.
I owned the taking of half a crown
for my judgment of the theft ; but faid,
I gave no other judgment, but that the
goods would not be recovered, being that
was all which was required of me : the
party, before that, having been with feve-
ral aftrologers, fome affirming fhe fhould
have her goods again, others gave con-
trary judgment, which made her come
unto me for a final refolution.
At laft my enemy began her before-
made fpeech, and, without the leaft Hum-
bling, pronounced it before the court
;
which ended, fhe had fome queries put
unto her, and then I fpoke for myfelf,
of his Life and Times. 109
and produced my own Introdu&ion into
court, faying, that I had fome years be-
fore emitted that book for the benefit of
this and other nations ; that it was allow-
ed by authority, and had found good ac-
ceptance in both univerfities ; that the
ftudy of aftrology was lawful, and not
contradicted by any fcripture; that I
neither had, or ever did, ufe any charms,
forceries, or inchantments related in the
bill of indictment, &c,
She then related, that fhe had been
feveral times with me, and that afterwards
ftie could not reft a nights, but was trou-
bled with bears, lions, and tygers, &c.
My counfel was the Recorder Green, who
after he had anfwered all objections, con-
cluded, aftrology was a lawful art.
' Miftrefs,' faid he, * what colour was

< with ?'

There were many Prefbyterian Juftices
much for her, and efpecially one Roberts,
a bufy fellow for the Parliament, who
after his Majefty came in, had like to
have loft life and fortune.
I had

I had procured Juftice Hooker to fee
there, who was the oracle of all the Jus-
tices of Peace in Middlefex.
There was nothing memorable, after
that happened unto me, until 1650, and
the month of Oftober, at what time
Captain Owen Cox brought me over from
his Majefty of Sweden, a gold chain and
medal, worth about fifty pounds- the
caufe whereof was, that in the year 1657,
^nd 1658, I had made honourable men-
tion of him : the Anglicus of 1658 being
tranflated into the language fpoke at
Hamburgh, printed and cried about the
ftreets, as it is in London.
The occafion of my writing fo honour-
ably of his Majefty of Sweden was
this: Sir Bolftrode Whitlock, Krtight,
upon the very time of Oliver's being made
Prote&or, having made very noble articles
betwixt Chriftina then Queen of Sweden*
and the Englifh nation, was in his being
at Stockholm vifited frequently by Charles
Guftavus, unto whom Chriftina refigned
during his abode, and ufed with all man-
ner of civility by him, infomuch as fome
other Ambaftadors took it ill, that they
had not fo much refpeft or equal ; unto
which he would reply, he would be kind
where himfelf did find juft caufe of merit
unto any. He was a great lover of our
nation 3 but there was fome other caufes:

The great hopes I had of his prevailing,
and of taking Copenhagen and Elfmore^
which if he had lived, was hoped he
might have accomplifhed ; and had affur-
edly done, if Oliver the Protestor had
not fo untimely died ere our fleet of fhips
returned ; for Oliver fent the fleet on
purpofe to fight the Dutch; but dying,
and the Parliament being reftored, Sir
Henry Vane, who afterwards was be-
headed, had order from the Council of
State to give order to the fleet what to do
now Oliver was dead, and themfelves re-
ftored. Vane, out of ftate-policy, gave
the Earl of Sandwich dire&ion not
to fight the Dutch. Captain Symons,
who carried thofe letters, fwore unto me,
had he known the letters he carried had
contained any fuch prohibition, he would
have funk both fhip and letters. Oliver
faid, when the fleet was to go forth,.
* That if God blefied his Majefty of Swe-
' den with Copenhagen, the Englifh were
* to have Elfinore as their fhare ; which
* if once I have/ faith Oliver, '
the Eng-
* lifh fhall have the whole trade of the
* Baltick Sea : I will make the Dutch find
* another paffage, except they will pay
* fuch cuftoms as I fhall impofe.' Con-
fidering the advantages this would have

pen for being liberal, thereby to have ert-
couraged our famous and noble feamen,
or for writing fo honourably of the Swe-
difh nation, who had moft courteoufly
treated my beft of friends, Sir Bolftrode
Whitlock, and by whofe means, had the
defign taken effeft, the Englifh nation
had been made happy with the moft be-
neficial concern of all Chriftendom* I
fhall conclude about Oliver the then Pro-
testor, with whom obliquely I had tranf-
aftions by his fon-in-law, Mr. Cleypool;
and to fpeak truly of him, he fent one
that waited upon him in his chamber,
once in two or three days, to hear how
it fared with me in my feffions bufinefs
;
but I never had of him, directly or in-
dire&ly, either penfion, or any the leaft
fum of money, or any gratuity during his
whole Proteftorfhip ; this I proteft to be
true, by the name and in the name of the
moft holy God.
In 1653, before the diflblution of the
Parliament, and that ere they had chofen
any for their Ambaffador into Sweden,
Mr. Cleypool came unto me, demanding
of me whom I thought fitteft to fend
upon that ambafly into Sweden : I no-*
minated Sir B. Whitlock, who was chofen,
and two or three days after Mr, Cleypool
came again : 1 I hope Mr. Lilly, my fa-
* ther, hath now pleafed you : Your friend
2 (
Sir
of riis Life and Times, uj
* Sir B. Whitlock is to go for Sweden.'
But fince I have nlentioned Oliver Croirn
well, I will relate fomething of him,
which perhaps no other pen Â£an, or will
mention. He was born of generous pa-
rents in Huntingdonshire, educated fome
time at the univerfity of Cambridge : in
his youth was wholly given to debauchery,
quarelling, drinking, &c. quid non ; hav-
ing by thofe nieafis wafted his patrimony,
he was enforced to bethink himfelf of
leaving England, and go to New-Eng-
land : he had hired a pafTage in a fhip,
but ere fhe launched out for her voyage,
a kinfman dieth, leaving him a confider-
able fortune; upon which he returns,
pays his debts, became affe&ed to reli-
gion; is elefted in 1640 a member of
Parliament, in 1642 made a Captain of
horfe under Sir Philip Stapleton, fought
at Edge-Hill ; after he was made a Colo-
nel, then Lieutertant-General to the Earl
of Manchefteiy who was one of the three
Generals to fight the Earl of Newcaftle
and Prince Rupert at York : Ferdinando
Lord Fairfax, and Earl Leven the Scot,
were the other two for the Parliament
:
the laft two thinking all had been loft at
Marfton-Moor fight, Fairfax went into
Cawood Caftle, giving all for loft: at
twelve at night there came word of the
Parliament's victory ; Fairfax being then
'I laid
ii4 Lilly's History
laid down upon a bed, there was not a
candle in the caftle, nor any fire : up
rifeth Lord Fairfax, procures after fome
time, paper, ink, and candle, writes to
Hull, and other garrifons of the Par-
liament's, of the fuccefs, and then flept.
Leven the Scot afked the way to Tweed :
the honour of that day's fight was given
to Manchefter, Sir Thomas Fairfax's
brigade of horfe, and Oliver Cromwell's
iron fides ; for Cromwell's horfe, in
thofe times, ufually wore head-pieces,
back and breaft-plates, of iron. After
this viftory Cromwell became gracious
with the Houfe of Commons, efpecially
the Zealots, or Prelbyterians, with whom
at that time he efpecially joined; the
name Independent, at that time, viz.
1644, being not fo much fpoken of.
There was fome animofity at or before
the fight, betwixt the Earl of Newcaftle
and Prince Rupert ; for Newcaftle being
General of his Majefty's forces in the
North, a perfon of valour, and well
efteemed in thofe parts, took it not well
to have a competitor in his concernments
;
for if the victory fhould fall on his Maje-
fty's fide, Prince Rupert's forces would
attribute it unto their own General, viz.
Rupert, and give him the glory thereof
:
but that it happened, Prince Rupert, in
that day's fight, engaged the Parliament's
forces
op his Life and Times. 115
forces too foon, and before the Eari of
Newcaftle could well come out of York
with his army ; by reafon whereof,
though Rupert had abfolutely routed the
Scots and the Lord Fairfax's forces ; yet-
ere timely affiftance could fecond his ar-
my, Sir Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell had
put him to flight, and not long after all
Newcaftle's army. Amongft themoft memo-
rable aftions of that day's this happened,
that one entire regiment of foot belong-
ing to Newcaftle, called the Lambs, be-
caufe they were all new cloathed in white:
woollen cloth, two or three days before
the fight. This fole regiment, after the
day was loft, having got into a fmall par-
cel of ground ditched in, and not of eafy
accefs of horfe, would take no quarter
;
and by mere valour, for one whole hour,
kept the troops of horfe from entering
amongft them at near pufti of pike : when
the horfe did enter, they would have
no quarter, but fought it out till there
was not thirty of them living : thofe
whofe hap it was to be beaten down upon
the ground as the troopers came near
them, though they could not rife for their
wounds, yet were fo defperate as to get
either a pike or fword, or piece of them,
and to gore the troopers horfes as they
came over them, or palTed by them. Cap-
tain Camby, then a trooper under Crom-
1 1 6 Mr. Lilly's History
well, and an actor, who was the third or
fourth man that entered amongft them,
protefted, he never in all the fights he
was in, met with fuch refolute brave
fellows, or whom he pitied fo much, and
faid, ' he faved two or three againft their
* wills.'
After the fight, Manchefter marched
flowly fouthward, &c. but at laft came
with his army to Newbery fight ; which
ended, he came for London, and there
he accufeth Cromwell, being his Lieute-
nant, to the Parliament, of difobedience,
and not obeying his orders.
The Houfe of Commons acquaint
Cromwell herewith, and charge him, as
he would anfwer it before God, that the
day following he fhould give them a full
account of Manchefter's proceedings, and
the caufe and occafion of their difference,
and of the reafons why Manchefter did
not timely move weftward for the relief
of Eflex, then in the weft, who was
abfolutely routed, inforced to fly, all his
foot taken, and all his ordnance and
train of artillery, only the horfe efcaping.
Cromwell the next day gave this ac-
count to Mr. Speaker in the Houfe of
Commonsâby way of recrimination.
That after God had given them a fuc-
cefsful victory at Marfton over the King's
forces, and that they had well refrefhed
their
of his Life and Times. 117
their army, Manchefter, by their order,
did move fouthward, but with fuch flow-
nefs, that fometimes he would not march
for three days together; fometimes he
would lie ftill one day, then two days
;
whereupon he faid, confidering the Earl
of ElTex was in the weft, with what
fuccefs he then knew not, he moved
Manchefter feveral times to quicken his
march to the weft, for relief of EfTex, if
he were beaten, or to divert the King's
forces from following of Eflex ; but he
faid Manchefter ftill refufed to make any
hafte ; and that one day he faid, *
If any
' man but yourfelf, Lieutenant, fhould
* fo frequently trouble me, I would call
ft
him before a Council of War. We
* have beaten the King's forces in the
* north ; if we fhould do fo in the weft,
* his Majefty is then undone : He hath
4
many fons living $ if any of them come
* to the Crown, as they well may, they
* will never forget us/ This Major Ham-
mond, a man of honour, will juftify
as well as myfelf. After which he march-
ed not at all, until he had order from
the Committee to haften weftward, by
reafon of Eflex's being loft in Corn-
wall, which then he did; and at New-
bery fight, it is true, I refufed to obey
his directions and order : for this it
was ; his Majefty's horfe being betwixt
t 3 four
n8 Mr. Lilly's History
four and five thoufand in a large com-r
rnon, in good order, he commands me,
Mr. Speaker, to charge them; we hav^
ing no way to come at them but through
a narrow lane, where not above three
horfe could march abreaft ; whereby
had I followed his order, we had been
all cut off ere we could have got into
any order. Mr. Speaker, (and then he
wept; which he could do toties quoties)
I confidering that all the vifible army
you then had, wac by this counfel in
danger to be loft, refufed thus to en-
danger the main ftrength, which now
moft of all confifted of thofe horfe un-
der my command, &c. This his re-
crimination was well accepted by ihe
Houfe of Commons, who thereupon,
and from that time, thought there was
none of the Houfe of Lords, very fit to
fae entrufted with their future armies, but
had then thoughts of making a com-
moner their General; which afterwards
they did, and elefted Sir Thomas Fair-
fax their General, and Cromwell Lieu-
tenant- General ; but it was next fpring
firft. Upon EfTex's being loft in Corn-
wall, I heard Serjeant Maynard fay, ' If
* now the King hafte to London we are
' undone, having no army to refift him.'
His Majefty had many misfortunes
ever attending him, during his abode at

of his Life and Times. 119
Oxford; fome by reafon of that great
animofity betwixt Prince Rupert and the
Lord Digby, each endeavouring to crofs
one another -
9 but the worft of all was
by treachery of feveral officers under his
command, and in his fervice ; for the
Parliament had in continual pay one
Colonel of the King's Council of War
;
one Lieutenant-Colonel ; one Captain
;
one Enfign; one or two Serjeants; feve-
ral Corporals, who had conftant pay, and
duly paid them every month, according
to the capacity of their offices and places,
and yet none of thefe knew any thing of
each other's being fo employed. There
were feveral well-wifliers unto the Parlia-
ment in Oxford, where each left his let-
ter, putting it in at the hole of a glafs-
window, as he made water in the ftreet.
What was put in at the window in any
of thofe houfes, was the fame day con-
veyed two miles off by fome in the ha-
bit of town-gardeners, to the fide of a
ditch, where one or more were ever ready
to give the intelligence to the next Par-
liament garrifon : I was then familiar with
all the fpies that conftantly went in and
out to Oxford.
But once more to my own aftions. I
had in 1652 and 1653 and 1654 much
contention with Mr. Gatacre of Rother-
hithe, a man endued with all kind of
I
4 learningf
i2o Mr. Lilly's History
learning, and the ableft man of the whole
fynod of divines in the Oriental tongues.
The fynod had concluded to make an
expcfition upon the bible; fame under-
took one book, fome another. Gatacre
fell upon Jeremy. Uppn making his ex-
pofition on the ^d verfe of the ioth
chapter,
(
Learn not the way of the heathen,
* and be not difmayed at the figns of
* heaven, for the heathen are difmayed at
' them/
In his Annotations thereupon, he makes
a fcandalous expofition; and in exprefs
terms, hints at me, repeating verbatim^
ten or twelve times an Epiftle of mine
in one of my former Anglicus.
The fubftance of my Epiftle was, that
I did conceive the good angels of God,
did firft: reveal aftrology unto mankind,
&c. but he in his Annotations calls me
blind buzzard, &c.
Haying now liberty of the prefs, and
hearing the old man was very cholerick,
I thought fit to raife it iip â and only
wrote âI referred my difcourfe then in
hand to thp difcufTion and judgment of
fober perfons, but not unto Thomas Wife^
acre, for Series bis pueri : Thefe very words
begot the writing of forty-two fheets

by Dr. Gauden, late BHhop of Exeter,

Several divines applied themfelves unto
me, defiring me to forbear any further
vexing of Mr. Gatacre ; but all of them
did as much condemn him of indifcre-
tion, that in fo fober a piece of work as
that was, in an Annotation upon a

In fome time after the Dutch Ambaf-
fador was offended with fome things in
Anglicus, prefented a memorial to the
Council of State, that Merlinus Anglicus
might be confidered, and the abufes againft
their nation examined ; but his paper was
not accepted of, or I any way molefted.
In Oliver's ProteCtorfhip, I wrote freely
and fatyrical enough : he was now become
Independant, and all the foldiery my
friends for when he was in Scotland,
the day of one of their fights, a foldier
flood with Anglicus in his hand; and

I had long before predicted the down-
fall of Prefbytery, as you (moft honoured
Sir) in the figure thereof, in my Intro-
duction, may obferve ; and it was upon
this occafion. Sir Thomas Middleton of
Chark Caftle, enemy to Prefbytery, feeing
they much prevailed, being a member of
the Houfe, ferioufly demanded my judg-
ment, if Prefbytery fhould prevail, or
not, in England? The figure printed in
my Introduction, will beft give you an

Of the Year 1660; the A&ions
whereof, as they were remark-
able in England, fo were they
no lefs memorable as to my par-
ticular Fortune and Perfon.
Upon the Lord General Monk's return-
ing from Scotland with his army into
England, fuddenly after his coming to
London, Richard Cromwell, the then
Prote&or's authority was laid afide,
and the old Parliament reftored; the
Council of State fat as formerly. The
firft act they put the General upon was,
to take down the city gates and port-
culluTes, an aft which, the General faid,
was fitter for a Janizary to do than for
a General ; yet he effe&ed the Commands
received, and then lodged in the city
with his army. The citizens took this
pulling down of their gates fo heinoufly,
ihat one night the ruder fort of them
procured all the rumps of beef, and
other baggage, and publickly burnt them
ill the ftreets, in derifion of the then
Parliament,
124 MR * Lilly's History
Parliament, calling them that now fat,
The Rump. This hurly-burly was ma-
naged as well by the General's foldiers
as the citizens. The King's health was
publickly drank all over the city, to the
confufion of the Parliament. The mat-
ter continued until midnight, or longer.
The Council of State, fitting at White-
Hall, had hereof no knowledge, until
Sir Martin Noell, a difcreet citizen, came
about nine at night, and then firft in-
formed them thereof. The Council could
not believe it, until they had fent fome
minifters of their own, who affirmed
the verity thereof. They were at a ftand,
and could not refolve what to do ; at laft
Nevil Smith came, being one of them,
and publickly protefted there was but one
way to regain their authority, and to
be revenged of this affront, and to over-
throw the Lord General Monk, whom
they now perceived intended otherways
than he had pretended ; his counfel was,
to take away Monk's commiffion, and to
give a prefent commiffion to Major-Gene-
ral Lambert to be their General ; which
counfel of his, if they would take and put
it fpeedily in execution, would put an end
unto all the prefent mifchiefs. The
Council in general did all very well ap-
prove Nevil Smith's judgment ; but pre-
sently up ftarts Sir Arthur Hazellrigg,
of his Life and Times. 125
and makes a (harp inve&ive againft Lam-
bert, and concluded, he would rather
perifh under the King of Scots power,
than that Lambert fhould ever any more
have command under the Parliament.
The Lord General fuddenly after brings
in the long excluded Members to fit in
Parliament, being perfons of great judg-
ment, and formerly enforced from fitting
therein by the foldiery, and connivance
of thofe who filled themfelves the godly
part of the Parliament. Thefe honour-
able patriots prefently voted his Majefty's
coming into England, and fo he did in
May 1660. But becaufe Charles the Se-
cond, now (1667.) King of England,
Son of Charles the Firft, grandchild to
James the Firft, King of Great Brit-
tany, was fo miraculoufly reftored, and
fo many hundreds of years fince prophe-
fied of by Ambrofe Merlin, it will not
be impertinent to mention the prophe-
cies themfelves, the rather becaufe we have
feen their verification.
Ambrofe Merlin's Prophecy wrote
about 990 Years fince.
He calls King James, The Lion of
Righteoulhefs ; and faith, when he died,
or was dead, there would reign a noble
White
126 Mr. Lilly's History
White King ; this was Charles the Firft.
The prophet difcovers all his troubles,
his flying up and down, his imprifon-
ment, his death ; and calls him Aquila.
What concerns Charles the Second, is
the fubject of our difcourfe : In the La-
tin copy it is thus :
Deinde ab Aufiro veniet cum Sole fuper
ligneos equos9 & fuper fpumante?n inunda-
tionem maris, Pullus Aquilte navigans in
Britanniam.
Et applicansftatim tunc altam domum A*
quilceJitiens, & cito aliamJitiet.
Deinde Pullus Aquilce nidificabit in fumma
rupe totius Britannice : nec juvenis occidet,
nec adfenem vivet.
This, in an old copy, is Engliflied
thus
:
f After then, fhall come through the
' fouth with the fun, on horfe of tree,
* and upon all waves of the fea, the
' Chicken of the Eagle, failing into Bri-
* tain, and arriving anon to the houfe of

Another Latin copy renders the laffc
verfe thus :

Deinde pullus Aquila nidificabit in fummo
rupturn, nec juvenis occidetur, nec ad fenium
perveniet* There is after this, pacificato
regno, 0?nnes occidet ; which is intended

Judges upon his father's death.
The Verification.
His Majefty being in the Low-Coun-
tries when the Lord General had re-
ftored the fecluded Members, the Par-
liament fent part of the Royal Navy to
bring him for England, which they did
in May 1660. Holland is Eaft from
England, fo he came with the fun ; but
he landed at Dover, a port in the fouth
part of England. Wooden-horfes, are
the Englifh fhips.
"Tunc nidificabit in fummo rupium.
The Lord General, and moft of the
gentry in England, met him in Kent,
and brought him unto London, then to
White-hall.
Here, by the higheft Rooch, (fome wjite
Rock,) is intended London, being the
metropolis of all England.
Since which time, unto this very day I
write this ftory, he hath reigned in Eng-
land, and long may he do hereafter. 1 o
December 1667.

128 Mr. Lilly's History-
Had I leifure, I might verify the whole
preceding part concerning King Charles.
Much of the verification thereof is men-
tioned in my Collection of Prophecies,
printed 1645. But his Majefty being
then alive, I forbore much of that fub-
jeÂ£t, not willing to give offence. I dedi-
cated that book unto him ; and, in the
conclufion thereof, I advifed his return
imto Parliament, with thefe words, Fac
hoc & vives.
There was alfo a Prophecy printed
1588, in Greek chara6lers, exaftly de-
cyphering the long troubles the Englifli
nation had from 1641 until 1660; and
then it ended thus
:
* And after that fhall come a dreadful
* dead man, and with him a Royal G/ [it
is Gamma in the Greek, intending C.
in the Latin, being the third letter in
the alphabet,] 1
of the beft blood in the
* world, and he (hall have the Crown, and
â¬
(hall fet England on the right way, and
* put out all herefies.'
Monkery being extinguifhed above
eighty or ninety years, and the Lord
General's name being Monk, is the Dead
Man. The Royal G. or C. is Charles
the Second, who, for his extraction,
may be faid to be of the beft blood in the
world,
Thefe
of his Life and Times. 129
Thefe two Prophecies were not given
vocally by the angels, but by infpe&ion
of the cryftal in types and figures, or by
apparition the circular way, where, at
fome difhmce, the angels appear, repre-
fenting by forms, fhapes, and creatures,
what is demanded. It is very rare, yea,
even in our days, for any operator or
taafter to have the angels fpeak articu-
lately ; when they do fpeak, it is like the
Irifh, much in the throat.
What further concerns his Majefty,
will more fully be evident about 1672 or
1674, or, at fartheft, in 1076. And
now unto my own aftions in 1660.
In the firft place, my fee- farm rents,
being of the yearly value of one hun-
dred and twenty pounds, were all loft
by his Majefty's coming to his reitera-
tion 3 but I do fay truly, the iofs thereof
did never trouble me, or did I repine
thereat.
In June of that year, a new Parlia-
ment was called, whereunto I was un-
willingly invited by two meflengers of the
Serjeant at Arms. The matter where-
upon I was taken into cuftody was, to
examine me concerning the perfon who
cut off the King's head, viz* the late
King's.
Sir Daniel Harvey, of Surrey, got the
bufineis moved againft me in great dif-
K pleafure,
130 Mr. Lilly's History
pleafure, becaufe, at the eleftion of new
Knights for Surrey, I procured the whole
town of Walton to ftand, and give their
voices, for Sir Richard Onflow. The
Committee to examine me, were Mr.
Prinn, one Colonel King, and Mr.
Richard Wefton of Gray's-Inn.
God's providence appeared very much
for me that day, for walking in Weftmin-
fter-Hall, Mr. Richard Pennington, fon
to my old friend Mr. William Penning-
ton, met me, and enquiring the caufe
of my being there, (aid no more, but
walked up and down the hall, and re-
lated my kindnefs to his father unto very
many Parliament men of Chefhire and
Lancafhire, Yorkfhire, Cumberland, and
thofe northern countries, who numeroufly
came up into the Speaker's chamber, and
bade me be of good comfort : at laft he
meets Mr. Wefton, one of the three un-
to whom my matter was referred for
examination, who told Mr. Pennington,
that he came purpofely to punifh me, and
would be bitter againft me; but hearing
it related, viz. my Angular kindnefs and
prefervation of old Mr. Pennington's
eftate, to the value of fix or feven thou-
fand pounds, 4
I will do him all the
* good I can,' fays he. * I thought he
* had never done any good ; let me fee

'
I fit I did fo. At my firft appearance,
many of the young members affronted
me highly, and demanded feveral fcurril-
lous queftions. Mr. Wefton held a pa-
per before his mouth ; bade me anfwer
nobody but Mr. Prinn ; I obeyed his
command, and faved myfelf much trou-
ble thereby ; and when Mr. Prinn put
any difficult or doubtful query unto me,
Mr. Wefton prompted me with a fit
anfwer. At laft, after almoft one hour s
tugging, I defired to be fully heard what
I could fay as to the perfon who cut Charles
the Firft's head off. Liberty being given
me to fpeak, I related what follows, viz.
That the next Sunday but one after
Charles the Firft was beheaded, Robert
Spavin, Secretary unto Lieutenant-Gene-
ral Cromwell at that time, invited him-
felf to dine with me, and brought An-
thony Peirfon, and feveral others, along
with him to dinner: That their prin-
cipal difcourfe all dinner-time, was only,
'
who it was that beheaded the King ; one
faid it was the common hangman ; ano-
ther, Hugh Peters ; others alfo were no-
minated, but none concluded. Robert
Spavin, fo foon as dinner was done, took
me by the hand, and carried me to the
fouth window : faith he, < Thefe are all
â¢ miftaken,_they have not named the man
' that did the fa& ; it was Lieutenant-
K 2 Colonel
^32 Mr. Lilly's History'
'Colonel JO ICE;. I was in the room
* when he fitted himfelf for the work,
4
ltood behind him when he did it;
*
when done, went in again with him
:
* There is no man knows this but my
' mafter, viz. Cromwell, Commiflary
'
Ireton, and myfelf.' ' Doth not Mr.
' Rufliworth know it?' faid I. < No, he
* doth not know it,' faith Spavin. The
fame thing Spavin fmce had often related
tinto me when we were alone. Mr.
Prinn did, with much civility, make a
report hereof in the Houfe yet Norfolk
the Serjeant, after my difcharge, kept
me two days longer in arreft, purpofely to
get money of me. He had fix pounds, and
his Meflenger forty fhillings ; and yet I was
attached but upon Sunday, examined on
Tuefday, and then difcharged, though
the covetous Serjeant detained me until
Thurfday. By means of a friend, I cried
quittance with Norfolk, which friend was
to pay him his falary at that time, and
abated Norfolk three pounds, which we
fpent every penny at one dinner, without
inviting the wretched Serjeant : but in
the latter end of the year, when the
King's Judges were arraigned at the Old-
Bailey, Norfolk warned me to attend,
believing I could give information con-
cerning Hugh Peters. At the fefliohs I
attended during its continuance, but was
never
of his Life and Times. 133
never called or examined. There I heard
Harrifon, Scott, Clement, Peters, Hacker,
Scroop, and others of the King's Judges,
and Cook the Sollicitor, who excellently-
defended himfelf ; I fay, I did hear what
they could fay for themfelves, and after
heard the fentence of condemnation
pronounced againft them by the incom-
parably rnodeft and learned Judge Bridg-
man, now Lord Keeper of the Great
Seal of England.
One would think my troubles for that
year had been ended ; but in January
i66t, one Everard, a Juftice of Peace in
Weftminfter, ere I was ftirring, fent a
Serjeant and thirty four mufqueteers for
me to White-Hall : he had twice that
night feized about fixty perfons, fup-
pofed fanaticks, very ddpicable perfons,
many whereof were aged, fome were
water-bearers, and had been Parliament -
foldiers ; others, of ordinary callings : all
thefa were guarded unto White-Hall, into
a large room, until day-light, and then
committed to the Gate-Houfe : I was had
into the guard-room, which I thought
to be hell \ fome therein were fleeping,
others fwearing, others fmoaking tobac-
co. In the chimney of the room I be-
lieve there was two bufhels of broken
tobacco-pipes, almpil half one load of
allies. Everard, about nine in the morn-
K 3 ing,
134 MR - Lilly's History
ing, comes, writes my mittimus for the
Gate-Houfe, then fhews it me : I muft
be contented. I defired no other cour-
tefy, but that I might be privately carried
unto the Gatc-Houfe by two foldiers
;
that was denied. Among the miferable
crew of people, with a whole company^ of
foldiers, I marched to prilbn, and there
for three hours was in the open air upon
the ground, where the common houfe of
office came down. After three hours, I
was advanced from this (linking place up
the ftairs, where there was on one fide a
company of rude fwearing perfons $ on
the other fide many (Quakers, who lo-
vingly entertained me. As foon as I was
fixed, I wrote to my old friend Sir Ed-
ward Walker, Garter King at Arms,
who prefently went to Mr. Secretary Ni-
cholas, and acquainted him with my con-
dition. He ordered Sir Edward to write to
Everard to releafe me, unlefs he had any
particular information againft me, which
he had not, He further faid, it was not
his Majefty's pleafure that any of his
fubjefts fhould be thus had to prifon
withqut good caufe (hewed before. Up-
on receipt of Sir Edward's letter, Eve-
rard difcharged me, I taking the Oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy. This day's
work coft me thirty feven (hillings. Af-
terwards Everartf ftood to be Burgefs for

Weftminfter; fent me to procure him
voices. I returned anfwer, that of all
men living he deferved no couitefy from
me, nor fhould have any.
In this year 1660, I fued out my par-
don under the Broad Seal of England,
being io advifed by good counfel, becaufe
there fhould be no obftru&ion ; I paffed
as William Lilly, Citizen and Salter of
London ; it coft me thirteen pounds iix
{hillings and eight pence.
There happened a verification of an
aftrological judgment of mine in this
year 1660, which becaufe it was pre-
difted fixteen years before it came to
pafs, and the year exprefly nominated, I
thought fit to mention,
In page 1 1 1 . of my Prophetical Mer-
lin, upon three fextile x^fpects of Saturn
and Jupiter, made in 1659 and 1660, I
wrote thus
â
' This their friendly falutation com-
* forts us in England, every man now
* poiiefles his own vineyard -> our young
* youth grow up unto man's eftate,
* and our old men live their full years
;
* our nobles and gentlernen root again ;
* our yeomanry, many years difeonfolated,

world; new laws, new Lords. Now
' my country of England fhall fhed no
* more tears, but rejoice with, and in
' the many bleffings God gives or affords
1
her annually.'
And in the fame book, page 118,
over-rigainfl the year 1660, you fhall
find, A Bonny Scot aÂ£ts his part.
The long Parliament would give Charles
the Second no other title than King of
Scots.
â
I alfo wrote to Sir Edward Walker,
Kt. Garter King dX Arms in 1659, he then
being in Holland
â
*7V, Dominufqi vejler videbitis Angliam,
infra duos Annos.âFor in 1662, his moon
came by direction to the body of the fun.
But he came in upon the afcendant
direfted unto the Trine of Sol and antif-
cion of Jupiter.
â
And happy it was for the nation he did
come in, and long and profperouily may
he reign amongft us.
In 1663 and 1664, I had along and
tedious law-fuit in Chancery, M. C. com-
ing to Quartile of Saturn and the oc-
casion of that fuit, was concerning
houfes ; and my enemy, though aged, had
1*0 beard, was really faturnine. We
came unto a hearing Feb. 1661, before,
tlje Matter of the Rolls, Sir Harbottle

of his Life and Times. 137
Grimfton, where I had the victory, but
no cofts given me.
My adverfary not fatisfied with that
judgment, petitioned that moft juft and
honourable man the Lord Chancellor
Hyde, for a re-hearing his caufe before
him.
It was granted, and the 13 June 1664,
my M. C. then directed to Quartile of
Venus and Sol. His Lordfhip moft judici-
oully heard it with much attention, and
when my adverfary's counfel had urged
thofe depofitions which they had againft
me, his Lordfhip flood up, and faid,
* Here is not one word againft Mr.

in, by misfortune, he is much traduced
and highly persecuted by his enemies : is

In 1662, and 1664, I was made church-
warden of Walton upon Thames, fettling
as well as I could the affairs of that di-
ffracted parifh, upon my own charges ;
and upon my leaving the place, forgave
them feven pounds odd money due unto
me.
In 1664, I had another law-fuit with
Captain Colborn, Lord of the manor of
Efher, concerning the rights of the pa-
rifh of Walton. He had newly pur-
chafed that manor, and having one hun-
dred and fifty acres of ground, formerly
park and wood ground lying in our pa-
rifh, conceived, he had right of com-
mon in our parifh of Walton : There^
upon he puts three hundred fheep upon
the common ; part whereof I impounded :
He replevins therp, gave me a declara-
tion. I anfwered it, The trial was to be

of his Life and Times. 139
at the Affizes at Kingfton in April 1664.
When the day of trial came, he had not one
witnefs in his caufe, I had many ; where-
upon upon conference, and by mediation,
lie gave me eleven pounds for my charges
fuftained in that fuit, whereof I returned
him back again fifty (hillings : forty {hil-
lings for himfelf, and ten (hillings for
the poor of the parifh he lived in.
This I did at my own coft and charges,
not one parifhioner joining with me. I
had now M. C. unto Quartile of Venus
and Solâboth in my fecond, Ergo, I got
money by this thing, or fuit. Sir Bol-
ftrode Whitlock gave me counfel.
Now I come unto the year 1665, where-
in that horrible and devouring plague fo
extre&mjy raged in the city of London.
27th of June 1665, I retired into the
country to my wife and family, where
fince I have wholly continued, and fo in-
tend by permiffion of God. I had, before
I came away, very many people of the
poorer fort frequented my lodging, many
whereof were fo civil, as when they
brought waters, viz. urines, from in-*
fected people, they would ftand pur-
pofely at a diftance. I ordered thofe in-
fected, and not like to die, cordials, and
caufed them to fweat, whereby many re-
covered. My landlord of the houfe was
.afraid of thofe poor people, I nothing at
1 all,
140 Mr. Lilly's History
all. He was defirous I fhould be gone.
He had four children : I took them with
me into the country and provided for
them. Six weeks after I departed, he,
his wife, and man-fervant died of the
plague.
In Monarchy or no Monarchy, printed
1 65 I had framed an Hieroglyphick,
which you may fee in page the 7th, re-
prefenting a great licknefs and mortality;
wherein you may fee the reprefentation
of people in their winding-fheets, per-
sons digging graves and fepultures, cof-
fins, &c. All this was performed by the
more fecret Key of ^ftrology, or Pro-
phetical Aftrology.
In 1666, happened that miraculous
conflagration in the city of London,
whereby in four days, the moft part
thereof was confumed by fire. In my
Monarchy or no Monarchy, the next fide
after the coffins, and pickaxes, there is
reprefentation of a great qty all in flames
of fire. The memorial whereof fome
Parliament men remembering, thought
fit to fend for me before that Committee
which then did fit, for examination of
the caufes of the fire ; and whether there
was no treachery or defign in the bufinefs,

rous fouls, that I conceive there was
never more civility ufed unto any than
unto myfelf ; and you know, there were
no fmall number of Parliament men ap-
peared, when they heard I was to be

Sir Robert Brooke fpoke to this pur-
pofe
:

The Committee feemed well pleafed with
what I fpoke, and difmifled me with great
civility.
Since which time no memorable aftion
hath happened unto me, my retirement
impeding all concourfe unto me.
I have many things more to com-
municate, which I fhall do, as they offer
themfelves to memory.
In Anno 1634, and 1635, I had much
familiarity with John Hegenius, DoÂ£lor
of Phyfick, a Dutchman, an excellent
fcholar and an able phyfician, not meanly
verfed in aftrology. Unto him, for his
great civility, I communicated the art of
framing Sigils, Lamens, &c. and the ufe
of the Mofaical Rods :
â and we did
create feveral Sigils to very good purpofe.
I gave him the true key thereof, viz.
inftrufted him of their forms, charac-
ters, words, and laft of all, how to give
them vivification, and what number or
numbers were appropriated to every pla-
va j i net
:

rtâ¬t : Cum multis aliis in libris veterum
latentibus ; aut perfpicue non intelleffiis.
I was well acquainted with the Specu-
lator of John a Windor, a fcrivener,
fometimes living in Newbury. This
Windor was club-fifted, wrote with a
pen betwixt both his hands. I have feen
many bonds and bills wrote by him. He
was much given to debauchery, fo that
at fome times the Daemons would not
appear to the Speculator ; he would then
fuffumigate : fometimes, to vex the fpirits,
he would cUrfe them, fumigate with con-
traries. Upon his examination before Sir
Henry Wallop, Kt. which I have feen,
he faid, he once vifited Dr. Dee in Mort-
lack ; and out of a book that lay in the
window, he copied out that call which he
ufed, when he invocated
It was thatâwhich near the beginning
of it hath thefe words,
Per virtutem illorwn qui invocant nomen tuum9
Hermeli
â
rnitte nobis tres Angelos^ &c,
Windor had many good parts, but was
a moft lewd perfon : My mafter Wright
knew him well, and having dealing in
thofe parts, made ufe of him as a fcri-
vener.
Oliver Withers, fervant to Sir H. Wal-
lop, brought up a Windor's examination
L unto
146 Mr. Lilly's History
unto London, purpofely for me to pe-
rufe. This Withers was Mr. Fiike's
fcholar three years more or lefs, to learn
aftrology of him ; but being never the
\vifer, Filke brought him unto me : by
fhewing him but how to judge one fi-
gure, his eyes were opened : He made
the Epiftie before Dr. Neve's book, now
in Mr. Sander's hands, was very learned
in the Latin, Greek and Hebrew tongues.
Having mentioned Dr. John Dee, I
hold it not impertinent to fpeak fome-
thing of him; but more especially of
Edward Kelly's Speculator.
Dr. Dee himfelf was a Cambro Briton,
educated in the univerfity of Oxford,
there took his degree of Doctor after-
wards for many years in fearch of the
profounder ftudies, travelled into foreign
parts : to be ferious, he was Queen Eli-
zabeth's intelligencer, and had a falary
for his maintenance from the Secretaries
of State. He was a ready witted man,
quick of appreheiifion, very learned, and
of great judgment in the Latin and Greek
tongues. He was a very great invefti-
gator of the more fecret Hermeticai
learning, a perfeft aftronomer, a curious
aftrologer, a ferious geometrician ; to fpeak
truth, he was excellent in all kinds of
learning.
With
of his Life and Times. 147
With all this, he was the moll ambi-
tious perfon living, and moft defirous of
fame and renown, and was never fo well
pleafed as when he heard himfelf ftiled,
Moft Exellent.
He was ftudious in chymiftry, and at-
tained to good perfeftion therein; but
his fervant, or rather companion, Kelly,
out-went him, viz. about the Elixir or
Philofopher's Stone ; which neither Kelly
or Dee attained by their own labour and
induftry. It was in this manner Kelly
obtained it, as I had it related from an
ancient minifter, who knew the certainty
thereof from an old Englifh merchant,
refident in Germany, at what time both
Kelly and Dee were there.
Dee and Kelly being in the confines of
the Emperor's dominions, in a city where
refided many Englifh merchants, with
whom they had much familiarity, there
happened an old Friar to come to Dr.
Dee's lodging. Knocking at the door,
Dee peeped down the flairs. * Kelly/
fays he, ' tell the old man I am not at
* home/ Kelly did fo. The Friar faid, * I
* will take another time to wait on him/
Some few days after, he came again.
Dee ordered Kelly, if it were the fame
perfon, to deny him again. He did fo
;
at which the Friar was very angry, ' Tell
L 2 Â« thy
I
148 Mr. Lilly's History
4
thy mafter I came to fpeak with him and
' to do him good, becaufe he is a great
* fcholar and famous ; bat now tell him,
* he put forth a book, and dedicated it to
* the Emperor : it is called Monas Hiero-
* gliphicas. He underftands it not. I
* wrote it myfelf, I came to inftruft him
* therein, and in fome other more pro-
* found things. Do thou, Kelly, come
* along with me, I will make thee more
* famous than thy mafter Dee.'
Kelly was very apprehenfive of what
the Friar delivered, and thereupon fud-
denly retired from Dee, and wholly ap-
plied unto the Friar ; and of him either
had the Elixir ready made, or the perfect
method of its preparation and making.
The poor Friar lived a very fhort time
after : whether he died a natural death,
or was otherwile poifoned or made away
by Kelly, the merchant who related this,
did not certainly know.
How Kelly died aftenvards at Prague,
you well know : he was born at Wor-
cefter, had been an apothecary. Not a-
bove thirty years fmce he had a fifter lived
in Worcester, who had fome gold made
by her brother's projedion.
Dr. Dee died at Mortlack in Surrey,
very poor, enforced many times to fell
fome book or other to buy his dinner
with, as Dr. Napier of Linford in Buck-
inghamfhire
of ins Life and Times. 149
inghamfhire oft related, who knew him
very well.
I have read over his book of Confe-
rence with Spirits, and thereby perceive
many weaknefles in the manage of that
way of Mofaical learning : but I con-
ceive, the reafon why he had not more
plain refolutions, and more to the pur-
pofe, was, becaufe Kelly was very vicious,
unto whom the angels were not obe-
dient, or willingly did declare the quef-
tions propounded ; but I could give other
reafons, but thofe are not for paper.
I was very familiar with one Sarah
Skelhorn, who had been Speculatrix unto
one Arthur Gauntlet about Gray's-Inn-
Lane, a very lewd fellow, profefling phy-
fick. This Sarah had a perfeft fight, and
indeed the beft eyes for that purpofe I
ever yet did fee. Gauntlet's books, after
he was dead, were fold, after I had pe-
rufed them, to my fcholar Humphreys:
there were rare notions in them. This
Sarah lived a long time, even until her
death, with one Mrs. Stockman in the
Ifle of Purbeck, and died about fixteen
years fince. Pier miftrefs one time being
defirous to accompany her mother, the
Lady Beconsfield, unto London, who
lived twelve miles from her habitation,
caufed Sarah to infpect her cryital, to
fee if file, yiz, her mother, was gone,.

fhewed her mother opening a trunk, and
taking out a red waiftcoat, whereby fhe
perceived fhe was not gone. Next day fhe
went to her mother's, and there, as fhe
entered the chamber, fhe was opening
a trunk, and had a red waiftcoat in her
hand. Sarah told me oft, the angels
would for fome years follow her, and
appear in every room of the houfe, until
fhe was weary of them.
This Sarah Skelhorn, her call unto the
cryftal began,
â¢ Oh ye good angels, only and only,' &c.
Ellen Evans, daughter of my tutor
Evans, her call unto the cryftal was this :
O Micoly O tu Micoly regina pigmeorum
veni, &c.
Since I have related of the Queen of
Fairies, I fhall acquaint you, that it is not
for every one, or every perfon that thefe
angelical creatures will appear unto, though
they may fay over the call, over and
over, or indeed is it given to very many
perfons to endure their glorious afpefts

even very many have failed juft at that
prefent when they are ready to manifeft

defirous to fee fornething in this nature.
He went with a friend into my Hurft
Wood : the Queen of Fairies was invo-

;
after that, amongft the hedges, a fmart

black curling hair rofe up, and I believe
a bullrufh would have beat him to the
ground : he was foundly, laughed at, &c.
Sir Robert Holborn, Knight, brought
once unto me (a) Gladwell of Suffolk, who
had formerly had fight and conference
with Uriel and Raphael, but loft them
both by carelefihefs ; fo that neither of
them both would but rarely appear, and
then prefently be gone, refolving nothing.
He would have given me two hundred
pounds to have aflifted him for their
recovery, but I am no fqch man.âThofe

It hath been my happinefs to meet
with many rarities in my time unex-
pectedly. I had a fitter lived in the
Minories, in that very houfe where fcav
merly had lived one Evans, not my tu-
tor, but another far exceeding him in
aftrology, and all other occult learning,
queftioned for his life about 16 12. I am
fure it was when the prefent Earl of
Manchefter's father was Lord Chief Juf-

by a peevifh Jury : but petitioning King
James by a Greek petition, as indeed he
was an excellent Grecian ; f By my faul/

I bought the moulds and (a) book for

There was, in the late times of troubles,
one Mortlack, who pretended unto Spe-
culations, had a eryftal, a call of Queen
Mab, one of the Queen of Fairies ; he
deluded many thereby: at laft I was
brought into his company ; he was de-
filed to make invocation, he did fo ; no-
thing appeared, or would : three or four
times in my company he was put upon
to do the work, but could not; at laft
he faid he could do nothing as long as I
was in prefence. I at laft fhewed him his

nan te fngit and therefore I will acquaint
you with one memorable ftory related
unto me by Mr. John Marr, an excellent
mathematician and geometrician, whom
I conceive you remember : he was fervant
to King James and Charles the Firft.
At firft, when the Lord Napier, or
Marchifton made publick his Logarithms,
Mr. Briggs, then reader of the aftrono-
my lecture at Grefham-College in Lon-
don, was fo furprized with admiration of
them, that he could have no quietnefs,
in himfelf, until he had feen that noble
perfon the Lord Marchifton, whofe only
invention they were : he acquaints John
Marr herewith, who went into Scotland
before Mr. Briggs, purpofely to be there
when thefe two fo learned perfons fhould
meet. Mr. Briggs appoints a certain day
when to meet at Edinburgh : but failing
thereof, the Lord Napier was doubtful he

would not come. It happened one day
as John Marr and the Lord Napier were
fpeaking of Mr. Briggs ;
f
Ah, John/
faith Marchifton, ' Mr. Briggs will not
' now come:' at the veryinftant one knocks
at the gate ; John Marr hafted down, and
it proved Mr. Briggs, to his great con-
tentment. He brings Mr. Briggs up into
my Lord's chamber, where almoft one
quarter of an hour was fpent, each be-
holding other almoft with admiration,
before one word was fpoke : at laft Mr.
Briggs began.
* My Lord, I have undertaken this
* long journey purpofely to fee your per-
* fon, and to know by what engine of
' wit or ingenuity you came firft to think
* of this moft excellent help unto aftro-
' nomy, viz. the Logarithms ; but, my
* Lord, being by you found out, I won-
* der no body elfe found it out before,
* when now known, it is fo eafy.' He
was nobly entertained by the Lord Na-
pier, and every fummer after that, during
the Lord's being alive, this venerable man,
Mr. Briggs, went purpofely into Scot-
land to vifit him. Tempora nunc mutantur.
Thefe two perfons were worthy men in
their time ; and yet the one, viz. Lord
Marchifton, was a great lover of aftro-
logy, but Briggs the moft fatirical man
againft it that hath been known : but the
reafon
156 Mr. Lilly's History*
reafon hereof I conceive was, that Briggs
was a fevere Prefbyterian, and wholly
converfant with perfons of that judg-
ment; whereas the Lord Marchifton was
a general fcholar, and deeply read in all
divine and human hiftories : it is the
fame Marchifton who made that moft feri-
ous and learned expofition upon the Re-
velation of St. John ; which is the beft
that ever yet appeared in the world.
Thus far proceeded Mr. William Lilly
in fetting down the account of his life,
with fome other things of note. Now
fhall be added fomething more which
afterwards happened during his retire-
ment at his houfe at Herfham, until his
death.
He left London in the year 1665, (as
he hath before noted) and betook him-
felf to the ftudy of pbyfick; in which,
having arrived at a competent degree of
knowledge, affifted by diligent obfervation
and practice, he defired his old friend
Mr. Afhmole, to obtain of his Grace Dr.
Sheldon, then Lord Achbifhop of Can-
terbury, a licenfe for the practice of phy-
fick ; which upon application to his Grace,
and producing a teftimonial [O&ober 8.
1670,] under the hands of two phyficians
of the college in London, on Mr. Lilly's
behalf, he moft readily granted, in the

Hereupon he began to praÂ£tife more

Saturday rode to Kingfton, where the

parts, and received much benefit by his
advice and prefcriptions, which he gave
them freely, and without money. From

then received a fhilling, and fometimes
an half crown, if they offered it to him,
otherwife he demanded nothing ; and, in
truth, his charity towards poor people
was very great, no lefs than the care and
pains he took in confidering and weighing
their particular cafes, and applying proper
remedies to their infirmities, which gained
him extraordinary credit and eftimation.
He was of a flrong conftitution, and
continued generally in good health, till
the 1 6th of Auguft 1674, when a vio-
lent humour difcovered itfelf in red fpots
all over his body, with little pufhes in
his head. This, in the winter [18 De-
cember] following, was feconded by a
diftemper w7
hereof he fell fick, and was
let blood in the left foot, a little above
the ancle.
The 20th of December following, a
humour defcended from his head to his
left fide, from eight o'clock at night till
the next mornii>g; and then flaying a
while in the calf of his leg, at length
defcended towards his toes, the anguifh
whereof put him into a fever. This hu-
mour fixed in two places on the top of
his left foot (one in that where he was
let blood two days before) which (upon
application of pledgets) growing ripe, they
were [28 Dec] lanced by Mr. Agar of
Kingfton, his apothecary (and no lefs a
fkilful
l6o Mr. Lilly's Historv
fkilful Surgeon :) after which he be-
gan to be at eafe, his fever abated, and
within five months the cure was per-
fected.
The 7th of November 1675, he was
taken with a violent fit of vomiting for
fome hours, to which a fever fucceeded,
that continued four months : This brought
his body exceeding low, together with a
dimnefs in his eyes, which after occafioned
him to make ufe of Mr. Henry Coley, as
his amanuenfis, to tranfcribe (from his
dictates) his aftrological judgments for
the year 1677; but the monthly obfer-
vations for that year, were written with
his own hand fome time before, though
by this time he was grown very dim-
fighted. His judgments and obfervations
for the fucceeding years, till his death,
(fo alfo for the year 1682,) were all com-
pofed by his directions, Mr. Coley com-
ing to Herfham the beginning of every
fummer, and frayed there, till, by con-
ference with him, he had difpatched them
for the prefs ; to whom, at thefe oppor-
tunities, he communicated his way of
judgment, and other aftrological ar-
cana's.

In the beginning of the year 1681, he

him, not having any glimmering as for-
merly.
He had dwelt many years at Herfham,
where his charity and kindnefs to his
poor neighbours was always great and
hearty; and the 30th of May 168 1, to-
wards the evening, a dead palfy began
to feize his left fide. The fecond of
June, towards evening, he took his bed,
and then his tongue began to falter. The
next day he became very dull and heavy
:
fometimes his fenfes began to fail him.
Henceforward he took little or nothing,
for his larinx fwelled, and that impeded
his fwallowing.
The fourth of June, Mr. Afhmole
went to vifit him, and found he knew
him, but fpake little, and fome of that
Icarce intelligible ; for the palfy began
now to feize upon his tongue.
The eighth of June he lay in a great
agony, infomuch that the fweat followed
drop after drop, which he bore with
wonderful courage and patience (as in-
deed he did all his ficknefs) without com-
plaint ; and about three o'clock the next
morning, he died, without any {hew of
trouble or pangs. Immediately before his
breath went from him, he fneezed three
times.
He had often, in his life-time, de-
fired Mr. Afhmole to take care of his
funeral, and now his widow defired the

leave from Sir Mathew Andrews (who
had the parfonage of Walton) to bury
him in the chancel of that church.
The ioth of June, his coarfe was
brought thither, and received by the mi-
nifter (in his furplice) at the Litch-Gates,
who, paffing before the body into the
church, read the firft part of the Office
for the Burial of the Dead. In the read-
ing defk he faid all the evening fervice,
and after performed the reft of the office
(as eftablifhed by law) in the chancel, at

WILLIAM LILLY.
OBSER-
OBSERVAT IONS
UPON THE
LIFE and DEATH
KING CHARLES I.
CHARLES STUART, late King
of England, was born at Dumfer-
lin in Scotland, about fifteen miles
from Edinburgh, November 19, 1600.
He lived forty eight years, and about
feventy two days. He died in the begin-
ning of his climafterical year, fatal many
times where killing directions in the na-
tivity threaten. Several charafters are
given of him ; fome do too much mag-
nify him, others as much vilify him. He
was well educated by his father under
careful tutors, men of great knowledge
in all manner of qualities, fit for educa-
tion of princes ; and came to the crown
being,
176 On the Liee and Death
being aged twenty-four years and about
four months, even in the flower of his
age. Of his infancy we have little to
mention, only he was noted to be very
wilful and obftinate by Queen Anne his
mother, and fome others who then were
about him. His mother being told he
was very f\ck and like to die, faid, He
would not then die, or at that time, but
live to be the ruin of himfelf, and the
occafion of the lofs of his three King-
doms, by his too much wilfulnefs : A
fad prediction from a mother, who moft
entirely loved him ; but it proved very true
in the fequel. Some affirm file had that
forefight of his condition from a ftranger,
who had not only great judgment in nati-
vities, but in the more fecret learning ;
others, that one Englifh, a Scot, inform-
ed her thereof firft. Queen Anne may be
thoughtto have the fpirit of prophecy in
judging fo rightly on her fon and daugh-
ter ; for (he fo much fcorned and under-
valued the Palfgrave for a hufband unto
the Lady Elizabeth, that in moft of her
language after and before the marriage,
fhe would call her Goodwife Palfgrave;
a name and title fhe thought good enough
for any woman fhould marry that dull and
unfortunate man : and indeed her fears
and predictions proved moft true. ,
The
old Scotifh Lady his nurfe was ufed to
1 affirm
of King CHARLES' I. 177
affirm as much, and that he was of a very-
evil nature even in his infancy; and the
lady, who after took charge of him, can-
not deny it, but that he was beyond mea-
fure wilful, and unthankful : Yet while
he was young, he followed his book feri-
oufly, which his elder brother Prince
Henry could not endure ; and therefore
King James would frequently blame
Prince Henry with the negleft of his
book, and tell him how his brother Charles
followed it ; whereupon the Prince would
reply, when that he himfelf fliould be
King, he would make his brother Charles
Archbifliop of Canterbury. And to fpeak
truly of him, he had many Angular parts
in nature ; he was an excellent horfeman,
would fhoot well at a mark, had Angular
Ikill in limning and pictures, a good ma-
thematician, not unlkilful in mufick, well
read in divinity, excellently in hiftory,
and no lefs in the laws and ftatutes of
this nation ; he had a quick and fliarp
conception, would write his mind Angu-
larly well, and in good language and
ftile, only he loved long Parenthefes. He
would apprehend a matter in difference
betwixt party and party with great readi-
ngs, and methodife a long matter, or
contract it in few lines : infomuch as I
have heard Sir Robert Holborne oft fay,
he had a quicker conception, and would
N fooner
178 On the Life and Death
fooner underftand a cafe in law, or with
more fharpnefs drive a matter unto a
head, than any of his Privy Council ; in-
fomuch, that when the King was not at
the Council Tabic, Sii Robert never cared
to be there. He had alio, amongft other
his fpecial gifts, the gift of patience ; in-
fomuch, that if any offered him a long
difcourfe or fpeech, he would with much
patience, and without any interruption or
diftafte, hear a fpeech or ftory out at
length ; but then he would expect the
fame civility from others. He was a great
admirer of his Queen (if he diffembled
not), very uxorious, feldom denying her
any requeft, and for' her fake was very
civil to the old Queen of France her mo-
ther. The height of his affection unto
the Queen, fully you may perceive in
thofe tranfeendent expreffions of his, in
letters fent unto her, the copies whereof
were intercepted at Nafebv, and fince
printed -
y his conclufion being always,
<c
Thine eternally," or, " Farewel dear
Â«â¢ heart."
He communicated bis weightieft, and
moft private defigns unto her; nay, tbere
was very little of any moment, but fhe
whs advifed with concerning it : and yet,
what reafon the Queen knew to the con-
trary, I could not learn, but ihe more

than once twitted him in the teeth with
diflembling, &C. a quality which indeed
he was as fufficiently mafter of as any
man living, and which queftionlefs he
had partly from his father, and partly
from the climate he was born in, viz.
Scotland. An indulgent father, careful,
if not too covetous to have provided pa-
trimonies for his children ; for he would
often fay, when fome beggarly courtier
propounded a monopoly or projeft unto
him, affirming it would produce unto
his coffers fo many thoufand pounds a
year, or much increafe his revenue; he
would prefently fend for the Judges, or
fome of his Counfel at Law, and if they
affirmed and confented he might by law
grant the thing defired, he often would
fay, * He knew no reafon, but that he
* might grant the matter in queftion,
f
. fith the thing itfelf was juft and law-
* ful, for he had many children to pro-
â¬
vide for/ Before the wars he was a
great enemy to bloodfhed, or wilful mur-
der, infomuch, that when one Stamford
had in an infurreclion in Fleet-ftreet, kil-
led a man, he could by no means be drawn
to fign a pardon unto him, though Stam-
ford had been Buckingham's favourite
and countryman, and very great inter-
ceffion had been made unto him for his
pardon. Where he once really affe&ed,
N 2 he
1 8Â© On the Life and Death
he was ever a perfeft friend ; witnefs his
continuance of affe&ion unto all Buck-
ingham's friends after his death, yea, un-
til his own laft decay of fortune. He
was a great lover, if not too much, of
the clergy, and highly advanced them ; in-
fomuch, as under him they grew firft in-
folent, and then faucy ; and indeed, his
indulgence unto them did in pait procure
unto himfelf the people's hate. Whether
his indulgence unto the clergy, proceeded
from a religious affeftion rather to ad-
vance the ways of righteoufnefs, or God's
caufe, than his own private defigns, it
hath been by many controverted $ but by
judicious men adjudged, that his own felf-
ends were therein more fought after than
propagating the gofpel ; fo that he ferved
himfelf by pretending to advance the
clergy. He erred extreamly in this one
bufinefs : when divers godly chriftians in
Norfolk delivered him a petition againft
the tyrant Wren, their bifliop ; he lent
for Wren, and bad him anfwer it. No-
velties in doctrine he hated, as much as
in ceremony. He loved not greatly the
ancient nobility or gentry of this nation
;
but did rather prefer creatures of his own,
or father's making. How much he loved
any of the nobility or gentry, but for his
own ends, he made it plainly appear at
Oxford, where he procured fundry of the
Eng-
of King CHARLES I. 181
Englifh nobles, and many gentlemen,
members of the Houfe of Commons, to
recede from the Parliament at Weftmin-
fter, and convene at Oxford, where him-
felf was ; and after that this mock Par-
liament, to fatisfy his defire, had convened
and afiembled, done what they could,
and thereby engaged their perfons and
eftates for him ; yet, becaufe they would
not in all things comply with his tyran-
nical humour, in a letter of his unto the
Queen, he complains of them unto her,
and faid,
c
He was fo troubled with a
* mongrel Parliament, he could do no-
* thing, &c/ This fcornful epithet, or
badge of difgrace, was all the reward any
of thofe unfortunate gentlemen had from
him ; but it was juft they fhould be fo
paid their wages, that in fo traiterous a
way deferted the Parliament at Weftmin-
fter, which fits to this day, &c. He
cared not much for the Common Law, or
very much for the Long Gown men ; he
learned that difaffeftion of his from his
father jemmy, who could not endure the
Lord Chief Juftice Coke, becaufe he ever
faid the Prerogative was bounded by Law,
and was limitable â¢ but that excellent pa-
triot was worfted for his dear affedtion to
his country, by Egerton the Chancellor,
who maintained the contrary; and was
worthily as well rewarded by the old Scot
N 3 for
182 On the Life and Death
for his labour, Jemmy taking the Great
Seal from him before he was dead, yea,
in a difgraceful manner. The Common-
alty of England he neither cared for, took
much notice of, or much difrefpected
;
holding this opinion only, becaufe he was
their King, they ought in duty to ferve
him. The Citizens of London, though
they much courted him with their flat-
teries, and large gifts, and in his latefl
extremities relieved him with confiderable
fums of money, yea even at Oxford in foap
barrels ; yet he flighted them, thought
them ever too rich, and intended for them
a fevere revenge. Had he ever mattered
the Parliament, he was advifed, by one I
well knew, to have demoliflied half the
city : what he would have done had he
been victorious, God knows. He would
often fay, it was the nurfery of the
prefent rebellion, for fa he called the
wars, &c. and that the body of the city
was too large for the head. I have heard
it from the mouths of many worthy gen-
tlemen, whofe hap it was to ferve him in
the late wars, that they did believe, had
he, viz. the King, by arms conquered
this Parliament, he would have proved
the greateft tyrant the Englifh nation ever
had to rule other them, and therefore they
did ftill pray for a reconcilement betwixt
the Parliament and Him, but could never
endure
of King CHARLES I. 183
endure to hear he fhould conquer our ar-
mies, &c. And fo much in a manner *
dropped out from the mouth of Rupert,
who giving command for executing fome
things contrary to the laws; and being ac-
quainted with his miftake, " Tufh," quoth
he, " we will have no more law in Eng-
<c
land henceforward but the fword." He
had a natural imperfection in his fpeech,
at fome times could hardly get out a word,
yet at other times he would fpeak freely
and articulately ; as the firft day of his
coming before the High Court of Juftice,
where cafually I heard him ; there he
ftammered nothing at all, but fpoke very
diftinftly, with much courage and mag-
nanimity. As a man he had his imper-
fections, for he was veiy covetous and
gripple, and fparing of his treafure (qua-
lities nothing commendable in a King ;)
and if at any time liberal, it was rather
to the undeferving or boifterous fellows,
than well meriting : by how much the
more humbly any made their addreffes
unto him, by fo much the more was he
imperious, lofty, and at a diftance with
them ; whereupc 1 it moft an end hap-
pened, that the impudent and bold were
rewarded, and the virtuous flighted ; which
imperfection of his enforced a bold-fpi-
rited Courtier to fay, ' There was no way
* to get any boon from him, but by im-
N 4 4
pudence,
184 On the Life and Death
c
pudence, and cajoling him with unbe-
c
feeming language/ Yet he himfelf was
never obfcene in his fpeech, or affefted it
in others. I have only met with, or
taken notice of, two paffages, which
argue him guilty of unbefeemimg lan-
guage. Firft, in all or moft of his letters
unto the Queen, he terms the Parliament
rebels, though they were lawfully con-
vened, and not diflblved, or to be dif-
folved, without their own confent ; but
time, and their victories, acquainted him
with more civil language, and taught
him to ftyle them a Parliament. In ano-
ther letter of his unto her, he calls the
Lord General Fairfax, who was then the
Parliament's General, their brutifh Gene-
ral ; a moft uncivil term and epithet to
beflow upon fo brave a man, fo civil, fo
valiant, and fo much a gentleman as Fair-
fax was, and is. Affuredly the progeni-
tors of the Lord Fairfax were gentlemen*
and of good eftates then, and at what
time the anceftors of the Stuarts were
but poor ftewards unto a family in Scot-
land : and what a preferment it is now,
or was fome three hundred years fince, to
be bailiff or fteward unto a Scotifh. family,
let the whole world judge ; for this was
the true original of the rife and growth
of the family of Stuarts, and no other;
though fince by marriage they came to be
Kings
of King CHARLES I. 185
Kings of Scotland, (as their own chroni-
cles relate). He did not greatly court the
ladies, nor had he a lavifh affe6tion unto
many. He was manly, and well fitted for
venerious fports, yet rarely frequented il-
licit beds. I do not hear of above one or
two natural children he had, or left be-
hind him. He had exquifite judgment
by the eye, and phyfiognomy, to difcover
the virtuous from the wanton. He
honoured the virtuous, and was very fhy.
and choice in wandring thofe ways, and
when he did it, it was with much cauti-
oufnefs and fecrefy ; nor did he proftitute
his affeftion, but unto thofe of exquifite
perfons or parts : and this the Queen well
knew ; nor did fhe wink at it. He had
much of felf-ends in all that he did, and
a molt difficult thing it was to hold him
clofe to his own promife or word : he was
apt to .recede, unlefs fomething therein
appeared compliable, either unto his own
will, profit, or judgment ; fo that fome
foreign princes beftowed on him the cha-
racter of a moft falfe prince, and one that
never kept his word, unlefs for his own
advantage. Had his judgment been as
found, as his conception was quick and
nimble, he had been a moft accornplifhed
gentleman : and though in moft dangerous
refults, and extraordinary ferious c6nfulta-
tions, and very material, either for ftate
or*
*86 On the Life and Death
or commonwealth, he would himfelf give
the moft folid advice, and found reafons;
why fuch or fuch a thing fhoukl be lb,
or not fo ; yet was he moft eafily with-
drawn from his own moft wholefome and
found advice or refolutions ; and with as
much facility drawn on, inclined, to em-
brace a far more unfafe, and nothing io
wholefome a counfel. He would argue
logically, and frame his arguments arti-
ficially -
y yet never almoft had the happi-
nefs to conclude or drive on a defign in
his own fenfe, but was ever baffled with
meaner capacities. He feared nothing
in this world, or difdained any thing
more than the convention of a Par-
liament ; the very name was a bugbear
unto him. He was ever refraftory againft
the fummoning of a Parliament, and as
willingly would embrace an opportunity
to break it off. This his averfenefs be-
ing well known to fome grave members,
they contrived at laft by wit, and the
neceflity of the times, that his hands were
faft tied up in granting a triennial fit-
ting, or a perpetuity as it were unto
this prefent Parliament ; a thing he often
blamed himfelf for fubfcribing unto, and
as often thofe who importuned him there-
unto. And therefore I wonder at that
pafiage of his (if it was his, which I
doubt of) in that book publifhed under

his name, and called his PORTRAI-
TURE, wherein he maintains this Par-
liament was called as much by his own
choice and inclination, as advice of others :
whereas it is manifeftly known even unto
all, it was only neceffity, and the impor-
tunity of the Englifh, who would not
fight with the Scots, and this only caufe
was it which gave occafion for calling of
this Parliament ; the Scots at prefent
being pofleffed of Newcaftle. For the book
itfelf, it maintains fo many contradidtions
unto thofe things manifefted by his own
letters, under his own hands, unto the
Queen, that I conceive the raoft part of it
Apocrypha ; the Meditations or Pfalms
wholly were added by others : fome loofe
papers he had, I do well know, but they
were nothing fo well methodifed, but ra-
ther papers intended after for the prefs,
or as it were a Memorial or Diary, than
fuch a well couched piece, and to fo little
purppfe. But it is anfwered by the
learned Milton. He was feldom in the
times of war feen to be forrowful for
the flaughter of his people or foldiers,
or indeed any thing elfe : whether by na-
ture or cuftom his heart was hardened,
I leave for others to judge. When un-
fortunately the Parliament had loft fome
of their men in the weft, at Marlborough,
and the Devizes, and they brought in 3
miferable
1 83 On the Life and Death
miferable condition, without hofeorfhoes,
or fcarce cloaths, into Oxford as a tri-
umph, he was content to be a fpeclator
of their calamities, but gave neither order
for their relief, or commands for eafe of
their fufferings ; nay, it was noted by fome
there prefent, he rejoiced in their fad af-
fliction. So afterwards, when Hambden
was wounded, or near that time in Buck-
inghamfhire, it happened a very valiant
foldier of the Parliament's fide to be
taken, fhipt ftark naked, his body being
Ihot in many places, and his fhoulder
broke : this poor foul in this condition
and pickle, was fet on a poor lean jade,
and brought as a triumph before the
King, where he ftood accompanied with
many Nobles. It would have pitied any
one's heart, to have heard how this poor
man was reviled and upbraided by lewd
people, even as he paffed clofe by the
King's prefence ; who neither pitied the
man, rebuked the unruly people, or gave
order for cure of his wounds : but God
cured the foldier inftantly, for he died
ere he was forty paces from the King's
prefence ; and notwithstanding the mifery
of the man, and fharpnefs of his wounds,
yet was the greatnefs of his fpirit and
courage fo undaunted, that he rode very
upright upon the poor jade, nothing
daunted either at his own prefent con-
dition,
of King CHARLES I. 189
dition, or prefence of the King. It was
obferved, that a lewd woman, as he pafled
by, calling him Rebel, he only looked
fternly at her, and faid, ' You whore/
Some Nobles feeing the hard-hearfednefs
of the King upon this fad accident, and
how little he valued thofe who either
fought for or againft him, upon this meer
occafion deferted him, and came for Lon-
don, &c.
Even the looks and geftures of Princes
are obferved, you may fee, and feveral
either good or ill conftruftions grounded
thereon. He was obferved in his diet to
feed heartily, and would drink wines at
meals freely, but not in excels. He was
rather violent than moderate in exer-
cifes : when he walked on foot, he rather
trotted than paced, he went fo faft. He
was nothing at all given to luxury, was
extream fober both in his food and ap-
parel ; in the latter whereof he might
rather be faid to go cleanly and neat,
then gaudy or riotoufly ; and as to the
former, he rather loved fober, full and
fubftantial difhes, than kickfhaws, which
the extravagant Nobles feed for their
wantonnefs fake; though many times, ere
they are fatisfied with curiofities in diet,
their eftates lie pawned for them. In the
general he was not vicious -
y and yet who
ever lhall fay he was virtuous, extreamly
errs.
tg6 On the Life and Death
errs. He was a medley betwixt virtue
and vice. He was magnificent in fome
meafure, and was the only caufe of the
building that miracle of fhips called the
Royal Sovereign : and when fome of his
Nobles acquainted him with the vaft
charge thereof, he replied, '
Why fhould
* not he be admitted to build that (hip
* for his own pleafure, and which might
* be upon occafion ufeful for fervice of
* the kingdoms, as well as fome Nobles
* prodigally fpent their patrimony in rio^
* tous and ungodly courfes, nothing either
* for their credits or reputations, or any
* way beneficial to the kingdom ?' It was
wifely faid of him at that time, * Every
â¬
man had his proper vanity, and that was
c
his, if the people accounted it fo.' He
was ill thought of by many, efpecially the
Puritans then fo called, for fufFering the
chapel at Somerfet-Houfe to be built
for the Queen, where mafs was pub-
lickly faid. Yet was he no Papift, or fa-
voured any of their tenets ; nor do I re-
member any fuch thing was ever objefted
againft him. Myfelf was once there to
gaze, whilft the prieft was at high mafs
:
the fexton and others thruft me out very
uncivilly, for wr
hich I protefted never to
come there again.
The aftions of Kings and Princes are
lookt upon with many eyes, whereof fome
ever
of King CHARLES t igi
ever prove either fquint or purblind. So
long as we live in this world, our con-
veriation cannot be with faints, but with
the fons of Adam, who ever fmell of
fome corruptions. Many alfo have blam-
ed him for writing unto the Pope when
he was in Spain : others think ill of him
for the many reprieves he gave unto femi-
nary priefts -> and Mr. Pryn fweats to
purpofe in aggravating his offenc^ there-
by. Why he might not as well in a civil
way write unto the Pope, as write and
fend his Ambaffador to the great Turk,
I know not : and for his mercy to thofe
priefts, who had not occafioned rebellion
in his dominions, truly charity bids me
to make rather a good than ill conftruc-
tion. And were not the common law of
this nation more in force than that canon
of fcripture, thofe things could not be
juftified, putting men to death for reli-
gion, or taking orders beyond fea, &c.
He was ambitious, and difdained in his
youth to match with any of the Englifti
ladies ; and therefore, upon hopes of a
marriage with the prefent Kine of Spain's
fifter, Monday the 27th of Feb. 1622.
he fet forward for Spain, went firft into
France, and from thence with his high
thoughts pafled the mountains. Neither
had he fuccefs in the marriage defired, or
did he get honour by that journey, al-
though
192 On the Life and Death
though moft magnificently entertained in
Spain. Some private difgufts happened
there and in that voyage, infomuch as he
never, after his return into England,
much cared for the Spaniard; which he
made publickly known in feveral years of
his reign. He was accompanied to Spain
with the Duke of Buckingham, one
whom formerly he extreamly hated, but
after i- at journey as extreamly fancied,
being his only great favourite. People
generally were nothing fatisfied with that
his journey undertaken fo rafhly; yet
many fober men judged very well of the
marriage itfelf, and thefe did publickly
aver, the Spaniard was rich, and a brave
man, would not be troublefome unto us
with unneceilary vifits, would ever bring
gold in his pockets ; was a people, with
whom the Englifh merchants had a great
and rich trade, and with whofe natural
conditions the Englilh did pretty well
fympathife ; and for the Infanta's ftrict-
nets in the Roman religion, there was by
many prudent men very little question
made, that it would produce any ill to
this nation, which now had been Prote-
ftant above fixty years : and they did alio
confider that the Prince was very furely
grounded in his own Proteftant faith, and
that the common law would well provide
for the multiplicity of priefts, who might
prefume
of King CHARLES L 193
prefume to come upon her account. The
27th of March, being Sunday 1625, King
Jamefc died. All that whole year a moft
furious plague affli&ed the city of Lon-
don, there dying above fifty thoufand
people. Amongft thofe, whofe misfor-
tune it was to abide in the city, during
that peftilent contagion, myfelf was one,
and therein beheld God's great mercy
unto me, being nothing at any time
vifited, though my converfation was daily
with the infededi Arid I do well re-
member this accident, that going in July
1625, about half an hour after fix in the
morning, to St, Antholine's Church, I
met only three perfons in the way* and
no more, from my houfe over againft
Strand-bridge, till I came there ; fo few
people were then alive, and the ftreets
ib unfrequented.
In June 1625, Mary, daughter of
Henry the Fourth, King of France, came
over, and was married to the King the
fame month. Several conftruftions were
made upon this marriage with France,
and many difputations in private were
had, whether fhe or the Infanta might
have been better for this nation. How-
ever the Parliament, in regard of the
ficknefs, was tranflated to Oxford, Au-
guft 1, 1625, anc* I2th Â°f the fame
diflblved. There are two main reafons
O given
194 0N the Life and Death
given for its dilfolution : one was, be-
caufe the Duke of Buckingham his own
favourite, fhould not be queftioned con-
cerning King James's death; and the
fecond was, his Majefty made feveral
propofitions unto the people, which they
would not confent unto. That King
James was really arid abfolutely poifoned
"by a plaifter, applied by Buckingham's
mother unto King James's ftomach, was
evidently proved before a Committee.
But whether Buckingham himfelf, or the
late King, was guilty either in the know-
ledge of, or application of the plaifter,
I could never learn. Many feared the
King did know of it, and they gave this
reafon ; becaufe, when the Parliament did
order to queftion Buckingham for it, and
had prepared their charge or articles, to
prefent againft him in the Houfe of
Lords, and to accufe him thereof, his
Majefty, contrary to all expectation, and
as an affront of both Houfes, and in the
Upper Houfe, when the articles came
up, gave Buckingham his hand to kifs,
carried him away with him, &c. This
aftion loft him the prefent Parliament's
affections. Even the moft fober of his
friends held him very much jverfeen to
deny a Parliament juftice in any matter
whatfoever; but in matter of poifon,
and the party poifoned being his father,
in
op King CHARLES L 195
in that to prohibit a due courfe, or a legal
proceeding againft the party fufpected, it
was to deny juftice with a refra&ory
hand. But at that time he was lufty
and young, and in his infancy of con-
vening Parliaments, thought to make him*
felf fure ever after, or to mafter the
Commons of England. There is no pen*
how able foever, can take off the blemifh
that will ever hang on him, for falling
out with his Parliament, becaufe they
queftioned, how and by what means his
father came to his death.
The fecond of February 1625, he was
crowned at Weftminfter. William Laud
altered the old coronation oath, and fram-
ed another new. And in March follow-
ing was a Parliament again fummoned,
and therein Montague queftioned for Po-
piili and Arminian tenets ; and Bucking-
ham was again alfo put to it by the Com-
mons. In time of this Parliament he fent
for the Bifhops, and blamed their back-
wardnefs, for that they did not inform
him, how he might promote the caufe
of the church. Indeed, he did well
know what fawning Jacks moft of them
were, and how eafily he might with hope?
of profit win them to his fide : they made
up a good part of the Houfe of Lords in
number. Here,again the Houfes of Par-
liament were troubled with Buckingham
O a and'
196 On the Life and Death
and Briftol, who was the vvifer man of
the two, but had leaft friends. Thefe
framed bills, and accufed each other of
freafon. At that time moft men pitied
Briftol, and thought him ill rewarded for
all his fervice in Spain ; for it was con-
ceived he acted not but according to
commiffion. In this Parliament he com-
mitted Sir Dudley Diggs, and Sir John
Elliot, Members of the Houfe of Com-
mons, becaufe they moft rigoroufly had
managed an accufation againft Bucking-
ham : An high affront it was to the Par-
liament, and a great breach of privilege
to commit a Member of that Houfe,
v/ithout the Houfe's confent : that matter
was much refented and very ill taken. By
thofe and other his high mifcarriages unto
both Houfes, they began to miftruft him ;
many gave fad conjectures of his actions,
and thought that in the end he would
either have or lofe all. June 15, 1626,
he diffolves the Parliament, only becaufe
they (hould not profecute Buckingham.
An argument of found affection unto his
favourite, to hazard the love of millions
only for him ; but a deep imprudence and
high overfight, to flight a whole nation
for love only of one man, and he but of
yefterday ; or a new creature, of but his fa-
ther's ftamping, and his own continuing.
It was in Auguft this year, that Tilly
overthrew his uncle the King of Den-
mark
of King CHARLES I. 197
mark in a pitcht field. How the King
carried the bufinefs witli his uncle, or
what treafure he promifed to fupply him
with, and did not perform, I know not.
Sure I am, the old King, after this fight,
could never endure our King, but Would
fwear, he endeavoured what in him lay to
make him lofe his kingdom. This I had
from the mouth of Dr. M. who heard the
King of Denmark fpeak what I write.
In Anno 1627, he fet forth men and
fhips to the Ifle of Rhe in France, under
the conduct of Buckingham. We loft our
beft men in that fcurvy defign, who were
no better than butchered by the French,
through the indifcretion of fome that had
principal command therein. But give
me leave, before I proceed farther, to re-
late what I had from the mouth of an
eminent Colonel, employed in that fuc-
cefslefs expedition, and one of the Coun-
cil of War, and a fworn enemy to the
Duke. Buckingham I well know was
extremely blamed about the lofs of our
men, the day of their retreat unto the
fhips. The matter was thus carried
:
The night before the retreat, the Duke
called a Council of War, and there fhewed
them the neceffity of their retreat the
next day, and th^t himfelf in martial
difcipline being wholly unexperienced, he
left the managing of the next day's action
O j to
198 On the Life and Death
to the ordering of the Council of War,
offering the fervice of his own perfon unto
any hazard whatever as far as any private
foldier. The Council committed the ma-
nagement of their retreat, by a free con-
fent, unto old Sir William Courtney, a
heavy dull covetous old man, who hav-
ing been twenty or thirty years a private
Captain in Holland, was, by Sir John
Burrows's means, made Colonel in that
expedition. And Burrows being now
dead, and Courtney the oldeft Colonel, it
was referred unto him how with fafety
to bring off our men. But he, either
through want of judgment, or forgetful-
nefs, having not fufhciently provided for
iecurity of our rear, our men were moft
unfortunately many of them cut in pieces :
and had not Sir Pierce Crofby with eight
hundred Irifh made good the retreat, all
our men had been loft. Courtney him-
felf fell injo a falt-pan in the defeat, and
was faved by means of his man Anthony's
crying, < O f^ve my Captain :'
but the
poor fellow loft his own life, and faved
his mafter's.
A bullet by chance, during their ftay
in that ifland, was fhot at the faid Court-
ney; and he having a piece of gold of
twenty one fhillings price in his fob, the
bullet light there, bent the gold, and fa
he was preserved, Courtney, at his re-<
turn*
of King CHARLES I. 199
turn, fhewed me the gold, and told me
the ftory. The King hearing of our
lofs at the Ifle of Rhe, and landing of
the Duke, inftead of being angry at the
lofs of fo many gallant men, or calling
him to account, lent to comfort the Duke,
deliring that he fhould not be troubled at
the lofs, for the chance of war was
And now we are fpeaking of Rochelle,
let me acquaint the world, that his Ma-
jefty was the fole caufe of its loling, for
he lent the King of France eight or ten
of his own navy, by which means the
Rochellers fhips were funk and deftroyed,
who before were ever able to relieve them-
felves with their own fhips, againit all
oppofition the Kings of France could
make. And that it may appear, he wil-
lingly lent thefe ihips unto the French,
and was not forced unto it by Buck-
ingham, as many have affirmed, I will
relate this pailage, perhaps not vulgarly
known. Sir John Pennington, being
Vice-Admiral, had commiffion to carry
eight or more royal fhips into France,
When he arrived there, the French ac-
quainted him the Ihips were to ferve the
French King againft the Rochellers, and
if that he the laid Sir John would ferve
in that employment, he fhould be ho-
nourably rewarded. But this gallant man
O 4 being
too On the Life and DeatHk
being truly Englifh, fcorned the proffer,
and utterly refufed the employment, and
ere he would refign the fhips unto the
French, came privately hin^felf unto the
King, and informed the King of the
French intentions againft Rochelle. But
the King faid only thus much :
* Pen-
i nington, go and deliver your fhips, and
' leave them in France and then gave
him 3. particular or private warrant un-
der his own h^nd for his difcharge, &c,
He had much ado to get his fhips again
from the French, and then was enforced
to fend Sir John Pennington amongft
the French, who feifed above a hundred
French fhips, and kept them until ours were
delivered. One thing is obfervable, that
we had only two failors affifted againft
Rochelle in our fhips, and no more,
This I rdate in honour of the feamen.
The deftru&ion of Rochelle is wholly
laid upon our King's fcore, as well and
jjuftjy it may he, to his eternal difhonour
and blemifh ; for had he not furnifhed
the French with fhips, Rochelle could not
have been taken as it was. And verily I
believe, the fad groans and miferies of thofe
poor Proteftants poured out unto Al-
mighty God in their height of calamities
againft our King, were extreme inftru T
mental in haftening down the anger of
Gqd againft the late King. However,
of King CHARLES I. 201
this aftion of his loft him the love of
the Proteftant Princes in all parts of the
world, and his own fubje&s could after
that a&ion never well brook him, but
daily were alienated in their affeÂ£i:on
from him, fuppofing him either not well
grounded in the Proteftant Faith, or elfe
a meer ftate-juggler and no other. I know
fome have accufed Buckingham to be in-
ftrumental about the lending thofe fhips :
'tis poffible he was. However, in March
1627, a Parliament was fummoned again,
Buckingham articled againft, and in Junq
prorogued until October ; after in March
diffolved, becaufe William Laud was re-
monftrated againft by the Commons, his
ruin laboured. There were alfo articles
exhibited againft Buckingham in the Par-
liament, but the latter of the two, vma
Buckingham was ftabbed the 23d of
Auguft 1628, he being ready to go unto
fea for relief of Rochelie, then befieged.
Many complained of the King in this his
various aftion about Rochelie, viz. in firft
aiding the French to deftroy the P^ochel-
lers fhips, then to take pajt with them
againft the King pf France; but to no
purpofe. Some therefore compared him
to a black witch, whom they lay can be-
witch and hurt cattle, but hath no ab lity
to cure them again. It was an a6t of
great inconftancy, and much diflionour
to
202 On the Life and Death
to himfelf and whole nation, though the
nation had no hand in it. When firft
the news was brought unto the King of
Buckingham's death, he was at a fermon,
or in a church, or at fervice. He did not
feem much troubled at the news, but
ftayed out the fermon with much pati-
ence, only gave Maxwell prefent direc-
tions to feize the Duke's cabinet, where-
in his letters and private inftruftions were.
All men generally, except a few court
parafites, were glad of Buckingham's
death : yet nothing was bettered in the
court or commonwealth after his death
;
which moved many to affirm, that all the
mifgovernments in the realm proceeded
not from Buckingham's ill advice, but
moft from the corrupt and depraved na-
ture of the King's own hafte. Sith I
am upon the death of Buckingham, I
fhall relate a true ftory of his being ad-
monifhed often of the manner of his death
he fhould die, is this manner.
An aged gentleman, one Parker, as I
remember, having formerly belonged un-
to the Duke, or of great acquaintance
with the Duke's father, and now retired,
had a daemon appeared feveral times unto
him, in the fliape or image of Sir George
Villiers the Duke's Father. This daemon
walked many times in Parker's bed cham-
ber, without any aÂ£tiou of terror, noife,
op King CHARLES I. 203
hurt, or fpeech but at laft one night
broke out into thefe words :
* Mr. Parker,
* I know you loved me formerly, and my
\ fon George at this time very well : I
Â« would have you go from me, you know
* me very well to be his father, old Sir
\
George Villiers of Leicefterfhire, and
\ from me acquaint him with thefe and
* thefe particulars, &c. and that he above
* all refrain the counfel and company of
* fuch and fuch/ whom he then nominated,
< or elfe he will come to deftruction, and
* that fuddenly.' Parker did partly,
though a very difcreet man, imagine he
himfelf was in a dream all this time,
and being unwilling to proceed upon no
better grounds, forbare addrefling himfelf
to the Duke ; for he conceived, if he fhould
acquaint the Duke with the words of his
father, and the manner of his appear-*
ance unto him, (fuch apparitions being
not ufual) that he fhould be laughed at,
and thought to dote, being he was aged,
gome few nights pafTed without further
trouble to the old man. But not very
many nights after, old Sir George Villiers
appeared again, walked quick and furi-
oully in the room, feemed angry with
Mr. Parker, and at laft faid, ' Mr. Parker,
1 I thought you had been my friend fo
< much, and loved my fon George fq
5 well* that you would have acquainted
f
him
204 THE Life and Death
* him with what I defired, but yet I
Â« know that you have not done it. By
* all the friendfliip that ever was betwixt
i you and me, and the great refpeft you
1
bear my fon, I defire you to deliver what
* I formerly commanded you unto my
f
fon.' The old man, feeing himfelf thus
folicited in this manner, promifed the dae-
mon he would; but firft argued it thus :
That the Duke was not eafy to be fpoke
withal, and that he would account him
a vain man to come with fuch a meffage
from the dead ; nor did he conceive the
Duke would give any credit unto him.
Whereunto the daemon thus anfwered;
' If he will not believe you have this dif-
c
courfe from me, tell him of fuch a
* fecret,' and named it,
1
which he knows
c
none in the world ever knew but my-
* felf and he/ Mr. Parker being now
well fatisfied, that he was not afleep, or
that the apparition was a vain delufion,
took a fit opportunity therefore, and feri-
oully acquainted the Puke with his fa-
ther's words, and the manner of his ap-
parition. The Duke heartily laughed at
the relation, which put old Parker to a
ftand : but at laft he afiumed courage,
and told the Duke, that he acquainted
his father's ghoft with what he now found
to be true, viz. fcorn and derifion :
* But

m
of King CHARLES I. 205

me acquaint you by this token, and he
* faid it was fuch as none in the world
* but your two felves did yet know/
Hereat the Duke was amazed and much
aftonifhed ; but took no warning or no-
tice thereof, keeping the fame company
ftill, advifing with fuch counfellors, and
performing fuch aftions, as his father by
Parker countermanded. Shortly after,
old Sir George Villiers, in a very quiet
but forrowful pofture, appears again un-
to Mr. Parker and faid, * Mr. Parker, I
* know you delivered my words unto
5 George my fon ; I thank you for fo
1
doing : but he flighted them ; and now

I only requeft this more at your hands,
* that once again you repair unto my fon,
* and tell him, if he will not amend, and

pulled a knife or dagger from under
his gown, * fhall end him ; and do you
* Mr. Parker fet your houfe in order, for

ker once more engaged, though very un-
willingly, to acquaint the Duke with
this laft meflage, and fo did ^ but the
Duke defired him to trouble him no fur-
ther with fuch mefiages and dreams : told
him, he perceived he was now an old
man, and doted. And within a month
after meeting Mr. Parker on Lambeth-
Bridge,
2o6 On the Life and Death
Bridge, Â« Now, Mr. Parker, v/hat fay yotl
1
of your dream ?' Who only returned,
* Sir, I wifh it may never have fuccefs/
&c. But within fix weeks after, he was
ftabbed with a knife, according to his
father's admonition before-hand -
y and Mr.
Parker died foon after he had feen the
dream or vifion performed.
The 2.9th of May, 1630, being Satur-
day, near unto one in the afternoon, the
preient King of Scotland was born. The
next day the King came to Pauls-Crofs;
to give God thanks for the birth of his
fon, where were prefented unto him thefe
verfes
:

he had a dangerous paflage from Brunt-
Ifland, and hardly efcaped drowning.
Some of his houfhold-ftuff or plate was
loft.
In 1634, he was infinitely troubled with
faftion in his court, which much difpleaf*
ed him; but by little and little he put
all things in order again. Then alfo he
levied
of King CHARLES R 207
levied a general great tax upon the whole
kingdom, vulgarly called Ship-money,
becaufe it was pretended, it was for
maintenance of the navy : and truly much
of it was that way expended, and the
failors well paid their wages ; which oc-
cafioned for two years together a good
fleet of royal fhips to be fet forth, much
for the honour of the nation.
This fhip-money was generally miflik-
ed, being a mere innovation, and a cleanly
trick to poll the fubjecls, and cheat them
into an annual payment. Myfelf was
then a collector for it in the place I lived
in. I remember my proportion was twen-
ty two fhillings, and no more. If we
compare the times then, and the prefait
in which I now live, you fhall fee great
difference even in afFeffinents, the necef-
fity of maintaining our armies requiring
it : for now my annual payments to the
foldiery are very near or more than twenty
pounds, my eftate being no way greater
than formerly. Againft this Ihip-money
many gallant men oppofed, and at laft in
Parliament it was voted down.
In July 1637, viz. 23d day, there
was great difturbance in Edinburgh, about
a new Service-Book endeavoured to be
obtruded on the Scots by the King and
Canterbury. I have heard, an old wo-
man begun the quarrel by calling her
ftool
2o3 On the Life And DÂ£ath
ftool at the prieft, when he read thfc
Service-Book. Many very modeft divines
exceedingly blame both the King and
Canterbury far that bdok ; it admitted
unto the people, as I remember, the
Communion but in one kind. However,
by the prudence of feme grave men, be-
ing then Privy-Counfellors in Scotland,
matters were Rubbered over all that win-
ter in Scotland ; but in May, or April*
new tumults arofe, and truly I may almoft
fay, that that corrupt Common-Prayer-^
Book was the fole and whole occafion of
all the miferies and wars that fince that
time have happened in both nations.
Had his Majefty firft endeavoured the
impofition of that lame book upon ths
Englifh, moft men did believe we had
fwallowed it, and then the Scots muft
have done it afterwards ; for the clergy
at that time generally were fuch idle
and lazy lubbers, and fo pampered with
court preferment, and places temporal in
every lhire of England, and fuch flat-
tering fycophants, that doubtlefs the
great hand of God was in it, that thofe
rude Scots firft broke the ice, and taught
us the way to expel an infulting prieft-
hood, and to refift the King ; he endea-
vouring by unwarrantable means to in-
trude things contrary to the divine law of
Almighty God upon our confeiences.

In Anno 1638, the Queen- mother of
France, and mother unto the Englifh
Queen, widow of Henry the fourth,
King of France, landed in England, and
came unto London the 31ft of October.
She was very meanly accompanied, and
few of quality attending her. The King
moft humanely and generoufly receives and
entertains her, though all men were ex-
tremely againft it 5 for it was obferved,
that wherever, or unto what country
this miferable old Queen came, there fol-
lowed immediately after her either the
plague, war, famine, or one misfortune
or other. Strange it is unto me, how fhe
could be fo fatal to any land fhe entred
into* True it is, and I do very well
know> that fome people born under an
unfortunate conftellation of heaven (with-
out this, that they live above nature, and
live wholly in the fpirit) are fo extreme
unfuccefsful in every thing they under-
take, that let them ufe the greateft in-
duftry they can to be rich* all will not
amount to obtain a poor living, though
they are affifted not only with a good
ftock of money to begin their profefhon
with, but have alfo many very profitable
and affifting friends, and means for their
better encouragement and furtherance.
It is very poUible, that fuch like ill for-
2 tune from her infancy might attend this
P ~ old
210 On the Life and Death
old Queen, as to be thought an unlucky
prefage of what mifchief prefently fol-
lowed her in thofe countries flie refided
in.
in November, proclamation was made
to diffolve the great affembly in Scotland,
but to little purpofe ; for the Scots have
this privilege belonging unto them, that
where, and when they pleafe, to obey no
edicts or commands of their Kings, ex-
cept thofe edifts fancy their own humours.
This proclamation was laughed at, and
flighted by the Scots, who made it appear
they were in good earneft, and began to
raife an army for their own defence, by
no means enduring the half Popifti Com-
mon-Prayer-Book. This raifing of an
army by the Scots, in oppofition of the
Common-Prayer- Book, made our pre-
lates prick up their ears, and the lazy
bifhops moft of all, who convened, and
raifed amongft their own Levitical Tribe
great fums of money towards the main-
tenance* of an army againft the Scots,
whom they now hated worfe than Turks.
Several particular men are fummoned to
appear at court, are enforced to lend vaft
fums of money towards the maintenance
of an army. I have heard fome affirm,
the King had in his coffers at that time
above fix hundred thoufand pounds : No
great
of King CHARLES I. 2x1
great fum for fo provident a prince, and
fuch large incomes as he had.
In or about the 27th of March. 1639,
the King fet forward towards Scotland.
His army followed immediately : the Earl
of Arundel being made general, a man
of great nobility, courage, and refolu-
tion, and one whofe anceftors had been
generals feveral times againft the Scots
with excellent fuccefs. There attended
the King in this expedition moft of the
nobility of this nation, but with great
unwillingnefs ; for the Englifh and Scots
having now lived like brethren, or na-
tives, or people of one nation, one a-
mongft another for almoft forty years>
and having intermarried one with ano-
ther, both the nobility or gentry, and
others, they thought it a very ftrange
thing, and not lawful of convenient, that
this nation fhould now take up arms,
and engage againft the Scots, only to
fatisfy the infatiable luft of a few domi-
neering priefts, and half popifh biihops
;
as alfo of an obftinate King, wholly led
by the nofe by thefe fnaffiing Priefts.
The common foldier was nothing well
pleafed, and marched moft unwillingly
upon this fervice. At laft both armies,
for many days, accofted each other ; yet
I never heard of fo much as one loufe
killed by either army; the Scots being
P 2 very
212 On the Life and Death
very tender of provoking the Englifh, and
they as willing to give no offence unto
the Scots. In June of that year a peace
was concluded betwixt both nations, the
Englilh nobility much defiling and fur-
thering it.
The King himfelf was mofl greedy
above all men of this union with the
Scots, as will appear by this enfuing
ftory. That day which was affigned for
certain of the Englifh nobility and Scot-
ifli to treat about thofe articles of agree-
ment or pacification the Scotifh nobility
were to produce ; the nobles of each na-
tion being fet, the Earl of Arundel be-
gan with much gravity to rebuke the
Scots for their unadvifednefs and rebel-
lion in raifing their army againft their
lawful King, and difturbing the peace of
both nations ; and yet he commended
the good nature of the King, who was,
notwithftanding their high provocations
and mifdemeanors, veiy inclinable to hear
their juft grievances, and to that purpofe
.had appointed himfelf, being General of
the Englifh army, and fbme other feleÂ£t
nobles of his council, to meet them that
day, to treat with them, and to hear
their grievances, and what they could fay
for themfelves. This gallant man was
proceeding further in his fpeech, and ag-
gravating the Scots offences, when, lo,
z unex-
of King CHARLES I. 213
unexpectedly his Majefty entered the
room, called for the articles the Scots
defired to he ratified, or confented unto,
read them fcarce over, but took pen and
ink immediately, and figned them, with-
out ever advifing with any of his coun-
cil j which fo difpleafed the nobility of
the Engliflh nation, that the very next
day after figning the Scots articles, they
all halted- home to their own habitations
;
the King flaying behind, and for his
daily exercife, played at a fcurvy game
called pigeon-holes, or nine-pins. His
fellow gamefters alfo were equal to the
game, viz. lackeys, pages, and fuch
others, ejufdem generis. He again no
fooner came to London, but as I remem-
ber, caufed thpfe articles to be burned by
the common hangman; making himfelf
a? ridiculous in doing the one, as he was
reputed weak and fimple of judgment in
doing the other. But at that time moft
imputed the burning of the Scots articles,
unto the advices given him, and importu-
nity of the proud clergy and bifhops, vyho
humoured him in every itcjiing defire pf
hjs, even to his ruin.
There happened many memorable ac-
cidents in this year 1639 ; as firft, five
eclipfes of the fun and moon ; three of
Jhe fun, twp of the moon 5 none was

the fun, which here began with us at
London the 2 2d of May, being Wednef-
day, at 3 hours and 52 minutes after
noon ; its middle was at 4 hours and 52
minutes, and its end at 46 minutes af-
ter 5. The digits eclipfed were 8. 51 mi-
nutes, 41 feconds; the whole time of its
continuance was 1 hour, and 54 mi-
nutes of time : The icheme of heaven

* They felt not a more fharp cold day in

* of the year, and height of the fun con-
* fidered. Til meddle little with the prog-
noftick part of this eclipfe : yet I might
tell you, that Mercury, at the time of
the beginning of the eclipfe, reprefented
the clergy, and he was retrograde near to
conjunftion with Mars : one ill omen unto
the clergy. At the middle of the eclipfe
the moon was their fignificator, and fhe
eombuft and near the dragon's-tail, which
fignified much calamity unto the priefts,
This eclipfe fignified unto the King much
treachery and damage by his friends the
Scots ; the degree eciipfed was in the op-
pofite degree, almoft, of the fun in his
radix. As this eclipfe fhewed his troubles,
or their beginning; fo the moon's eclipfe
in 8 / in 1648, ended his afflictions,
&c.
The elFefts of this eclipfe had moft in-
fluence upon the King of Spain, it falling
even in the very degree of the feventh
houfe ; fo that upon the 1 ith or 12th of
October 1639, upon our Engiifh coaft,
and under our nofes, almoft in our har-
bour, the Hollander burnt and funk a
great navy of his, with many miferable
fouls in the navy, which were to be land-
ed in Flanders. I know fome have not
ftuck to affirm, that the eight thoufand
â¢
P 4 men,
216 On the Life and Death
men, tranfported iji the Spanifh navy,
were intended to have been landed here in
affiftance of hi5 Majefty : but it was a
meer untruth ; for who could have hin-
dered their landing in Kent, if his Ma-
jefty had commanded it ? Sure I am, the
Spaniard took it ill at his Majefty's hand,
that he fuffered them to perifh fo near
our harbour. They alfo took exception,
that his Majefty having promifed them
ammunition and powder, which it feems
they wanted, it came not at the place for
them, either by neglect or treachery of
our officers, until they were worfted. The
truth of the ftory of thefe eight thou-
fand Spaniards in the navy was thus.
There was a part of that country where
the Walloons inhabit, under the domi-
nion of the King of Spain, in the Ne-
therlands, which was taken notice to be
very difaffefted unto him : now upon
landing thefe amongft the Walloons, fo
many of that people were to have been
tranfported into Spain, &c. When his
Majefty firft heard of the Spanifh. and
Dutch fleet, and their near approach, he
faid to one {landing by him, * I would I
* were well rid of both navies/ To fpeak
the truth of him, either as he was virtuous
or vicious, is not to wrong him but in
every trivial mifcarriage to make him the
author
of King CHARLES I, 217
authol of it, I hold it barbarous, and not
the part of an honeft moral man.
In this memorable year, the Scots, by
aft amongft themfelves, thruft out all
bifhops ; who after came fneaking hither,
and had by Canterbury's means large and
plentiful exhibitions for their mainte-
nance. His Majefty took the expulfion
of the bifhops fo ill, as that he refolved
to check the faucinefs of the Scots, his
dear countrymen, and caufed their trade
with us to be prohibited, and their fhips
to be feifed ; which fo enraged the Scotifh
nation, that they were again in 1640 in
arms. The King fummons a Parliament
in April about the Scots, which Parlia-
ment would not give a farthing unto
him towards maintenance of his intended
army againfl: the Scots therefore in May
he diflblves the Parliament ; which gave
great difcontent all over the nation, and
great encouragement unto the Scots
:
whereupon their army was fuddenly rea-
dy, and their prefumption fuch, as with-
out invitation, they, the 17th of Auguft
1640, entred England. The King pre-
pares an army of Englifh to refift them :
but fuch was the general inclination even
of the common foldiers, and fo great an
odium or hatred was caft upon William
Laud, Archbifhop of Canterbury, that
nothing would ferve the common foldiers
but
2i8 On the Life and Death
but a Parliament ; not a man of the
Englifh would fight againft the Scots,
who were now crept into the ftrong town
of Newcaftle : our foldiers were mutinous,
the officers generally difaffected to the
fervice : in fome countries the new raifed
foldiers flew their officers, and would not
go. All thefe commotions moved the
King little to defift from the war, being
continually furthered by the bifhops and
clergy, who in their convocation gave a
large benevolence towards the mainte^
nance of thofe wars, and commanded
their tribes in their feveral pulpits to in^
veigh, and cry aloud againft the profane
Scots, and to perfuade the people to aflift
as willingly as againft Infidels or Turks.
His Majefty again commanded the nobili-
ty to attend him in this Northern expe-
dition, who leifurely, and rather unfea-*
fonably or unwillingly, than otherways,
attended him at York.
All men knew this war was promoted
by the clergy, whom the nobility began
to difdain and fcorn, and the gentry and
yeomanry of England extreamly to hate
;
for at this prelent time the high com-
miffion-court, and other bawdy courts,
did moft horrible injuftice againft the
perfons and eftates of any gentleman,
who by misfortune came thither. There
was alio one Wrenn, bifhop of Norwich,
of King CHARLES I. 219
born in London, a fellow whofe father
fold babies and fuch pedlary ware in
Cheapfide. This fellow very peremptorily
one day, as he fat in Judicature in the
High Commiffion-Court, faid openly,
* He hoped to live to fee the time, when
6
a Mafter of Arts, or a minifter, Ihould
< be as good a man as any Jack gentle-
f man in England.' And verily the pride
of this faucy citizen's fon, hath been one
main Â£aufe of the ruin of the clergy.
Concerning this Wrenn, I know Canter-
bury preferred him, and brought him to
thofe Ecclefiaftical advancements in court
and church, which he enjoyed. I do alfo
know, and have heard it from fome who
waited on Canterbury in his chamber,
that he would oft fay, that the rafh ac-
tions and unwarrantable proceedings of
this Wrenn would undo the clergy ; but
in regard he had been the fole means of
his advancement, he could not well do
any aft prejudicial againft him, but it
would redound to the difhonour of him-
felf, and the clergy in general : alfo he
had many reluftancies in himfelf, for
preferring fo unworthy a fcornful fellow,
who proved the fcandal and fcorn of
churchmen, and an extraordinary plague
to the whole nation. For upon his
plaguing and punifhing many godly
clothiers in the countries of Norfolk and
Suffolk,
220 On the Life; and Death
Suffolk, they were forced to leave their
native country, and betake themfelves and
families into the United Provinces, where
they have taught the Dutch the art and
manfaÂ£ture of cloathing, even to the ut-
ter impoverifhment of this whole nation,
&c. and yet this wretched Wrenn lives,
&c.
As I remember, near upon, or in this
year 1639, or 1640, the citizens of Lon-
don were miferably abufed by a beggarly
Knight, one Sir Phillips of Ireland, who
exhibited his bill againft them, for cer-
tain mifdemeanors pretended to be com-
mitted by fome of their fub-officers in
Ireland, about the parts of London-Derry.
True it is, the citizens of London very
gallantly, about the coming in of King
James, or not long after, fent colonies of
their own in great numbers, and at their
own extreme great charges, to fettle a
civil plantation in the North of Ireland.
They had a large patent from King James,
and many privileges granted unto them
for their fo doing and planting. Above
thirty years they had quietly poflefled their
own lands there, had built many beauti-
ful market-towns, one or more city or
cities, many churches in the territories
afligned them. But near thefe years of
1639, or 1640, this Sir Phillips demand-
ing fome unreafonable things of the citi-
zens,
of King CHARLES L 221
Zens, and being denied them, he in ma-
lice exhibits his bill for mifdemeanors of
their officers, againfl: the Londoners in
the Star-chamber ; brought the caufe unto
a hearing; the court of Star-chamber fined
the Londoners deeply, adjudged their plan-
tations forfeited to the King, who as ea-
gerly and greedily fwallowed them for his
own. This very acl: in or near this exi-
gence of time, fo imbittered the fpirits of
the citizens, that although they were
fingularly invited for loan of monies, and
had as great plenty in their pofleffions as
ever, yet would not contribute any af-
fiftance or money againft the Scots, or
advance of his Majefty in this his Scotifh
expedition. And though I do not at-
tribute thefe cafualties and lolTes of the
cities, to be derived or caufed from the
eclipfe of 1639, although the eclipfe was
in Gemini, which fign is the afcendant
of London : yet certainly, that Eclipfe
did in a natural way threaten or portend
much damage unto them, and did mani-
feft the cafualties, but was not the caufe.
There was at laft a ceffation of arms
by confent of both parties, Scots and
Englifh. Some petty fcuffling there was
to no purpofe. The King, when he faw
no other means could be thought on for
to ferve his turn, and that the common
foldier unanimoufly refufed engaging with
the
Â£22 On the Life and Death
the Scots, by the conftant and earnefi
defire of the Englifh nobility, which at-
tended him, he with much unwillingnefs
at length was content to give fummons
for another Parliament to be convened
the third day of November 1640. But
you mull underftand in the mean while,
when the King faw he could no ways
engage the Englifh againft the Scots, he
had fent unto Ireland for the then pre-
fent Lord Deputy, the Earl of Strafford,
formerly Sir Thomas Wentworth, a York-
fhire gentleman by birth, and one who
had formerly been a great ftickler againft
him, until, poifoned with court-prefer-
ment, he turned Royalift, and fo was
made Lord Deputy of Ireland ; a man of
the rareft parts and deepeft judgment of
any Englifhman living ; I fay, he fent
for this Strafford to confult with him
about compofmg thefe emergent differ-
ences. Strafford advifes with Canterbury,
all to little purpofe ; for the Bifhop was
a very afs in any thing but church-mat-
ters ; the hand of providence now going
along with the Parliament and common-
wealth, who became mafters of all pub-
lick fpirited people, the King daily de-
clining. In April 1641, the Parliament
accufe Strafford for feveral mifdemeanors,
treafons, tyrannies, &c. againft the com-
monwealth, during his government in
Ireland.
of King CHARLES L 223
Ireland. The Parliament follow it fo
luftily, that notwithftanding Strafford
fpoke and defended himfelf as well as
any mortal man in the world could do,
yet. he was found guilty, had his fentence
to die, and did die. Thomas Earl of
Arundel being Lord High Steward, the
King figned the warrant for his death,
either by himfelf or Commiffioners. Thus
died Strafford, the wifeft politician this
nation ever bred.
All men accufe the King for his falfe-
nefs and cowardice unto this man, who
being fatisfied in his own confcience, that
Strafford was not guilty of treafon or
death, but only of mifdemeanors, yet
ligned a warrant, either under his own
hand, or by commiffioners. Some there
are who do fay, with the fame pen, and
at the fame time, he figned the warrant
againft Strafford, and alfo the Act for a
triennial or perpetual Parliament, which
Ihould not be diffolved without confent
of both Houfes. Many affirm, the Queen
procured him to do both thefe things
:
others impute it to Hamilton. It mat-
ters not who did it, or perfuaded him, it
was his ruin, &c.
The matter is not great, who invited
the Scots into England: fome thought
Pirn, Hambden, and feveral other gen-
tlemen were inftrumentaL It is very like
it
224 On the Life and Death
it was true, and that the King kneiv
as much, but could not remedy it. The
Parliament however in policy and judg-
ment gave the Scots a round fum of
money for their lofies, and ordered them
to depart this kingdom, which they did
;
fo that in Auguft 1641, the King went
into Scotland purpofely to pacify and com-
pofe the prefent threatening differences
there.
In the fame month of Auguft 1641, I
beheld the old Queen-Mother of France
departing from London, in company of
Thomas Earl of Arundel. A fad fpec-
tacle of mortality it was, and produced
tears from mine eyes, and many other
beholders, to fee an aged, lean, deCrepid,
poor Queen, ready for her grave* necef-
iitated to depart hence, having no place
of refidence in this world left her, but
where the courtefy of her hard fortune
affigned it. She had been the only ftately
and magnificent woman of Europe ; wife
to the greateft King ever lived in France,
mother unto one King and unto two
Queens. The King cared not much for
the Eal*l of Arundel, bdng he was of
a fevere and grave nature, could not en-
dure court-novelties or flatterers, was
potent in allies, &c. But there was one
thing or caufe mainly above the reft, and
that was, becaufe the Earl of Arundel
being
of King CHARLES I. 225
being Lord High Steward and Judge in
Strafford's trial, gave his voice that he
was guilty of treafon, &c. The Earl
alfo had but a few years before given the
King a touch of his own great heart, and
the King's unthankfulnefs unto him and
his family. The cafe was thus : A prieft
pretends the King had a right in a
reftory : the Earl challenged for his, and
had procured Canterbury for his friend
and fecond. The matter had many de-
bates : for Arundel wr
as no fool, but flood
ftoutly for his right. Canterbury was as
violent for the prieft, and had procured
the King to take cognizance, or hear the
matter. The King upon fome flight
evidence maintained it was his, viz. be-
longed to the Crown. The Earl feeing
the obftinatenefs of the King, and his
fiding with a petty prieft againft him, and
his proper right, out of the greatnefs of
his heart, faid, * Sir, this reftory was
* an appendant unto fuch or fuch a
* manor of mine, until my grandfather,
* unfortunately, loft both his life and
* feventeen Lordfhips more, for the love
* he bore to your grandmother/ This
was a fmart fpeech, and home to pur-
pofe: it fo aftonifhed the King, that he
replied pretty mildly, * My Lord, I would
* not have you to think that fo poor a
' thing as this reftory or thing in queftion
"
' (hall
226 On the Life And Death
* fhall ftand in competition betwixt my
* refpect unto you and your family, which
*
I know to be deferving,' &c. After
that time the Earl little liked the King's
aftions, and therefore took this opportune
occafion of going away with the Queen-
mother: and when one faid unto him,
his Majefty would mifs him ; *
It is an
* ill dog/ faid the Earl, ' that is not worth
* whittling and though he is a King, he
â¬
will find Arundel's affe&ion unto him
* would not have been inconfiderable/
&c. Some few years fince, this Earl died
at Padua, being the laft man of the
Englifh nation, that maintained the gra-
vity and port of the ancient nobility; a
great lover of antiquities, and of the
Englifh nation. He brought over the
new way of building with brick in the
city, greatly to the fafety of the city, and
prefervation of the wood of this nation.
He was a great patron of decayed gentry ;
and being Lord High Marfhal of Eng-
land, carried too ftrift an hand againft
the yeomanry and commonalty ; for which
he was nothing beloved, but rather hated
of them. However, the gentry and no-
bility owe much unto his memory.
In Oftober 1641, the Irifh unanimoufly
rebel and mafiacre the poor Englifh, who
were not able to relieve themfelves, as
matters at prefent were handled, wanting
able
of King CHARLES I. 227
able governors to direft them. And the
very truth is, the way which at firft was
takÂ£n to fupprefs the rebellion, did only
fupport it : for confidence being given to
fortie of the Irifh nobility, and many of
them furnifhed with arms, they furnifh
their own kindred, being native Irifh;
who were no fooner poffefTed of arms,
but they became errant traitors to the
Englifh. A great queftion will here arife,
whether the murder of the Englifh was
5
by confent or commiffion from the King
unto the Irifh ? Many have affirmed in
words and in print publickly, that he
fhould be guilty of fuch a villanous aft
;
which I cannot believe, in regard I could
never have any allured relation, what thofe
commiffions were the Irifh boafted of,
they being only the affirmations of the
Catholick Irifh, purpofely to win others
unto their party, and feducing many by
faying, they afted by the King's commif-
fions. Had this been true, it had been
more than equal unt) his affifting for
deftruftion of Rochelle ; but I may hope
better things, both as he was a Pro-
teftant, a Chriftian, aid a King. Yet
methink there is little fatisfaftion given
unto this in his late pretended book.
Two main things are objected againft the
King, which that book meddles not with,

fo tender-hearted 6f the Irifh, as not to
fuffer above forty proclamations to iflue
ont againft thofe rebels in Ireland, and
thofe alfo to no purpofe, or unoppor-
tunely, when too late. Befides, to fhew
his refpeft unto them, I know he obli-
terated with his own hands the word
Irifh rebels, and put in Irifh fubje&s, in
a manufcript difcourfe, writ by Sir Ed-
ward Walker, and prefented unto him,
which I have feen of the Irifh rebellion,
&c. Secondly, whereas the Parliament
were fending over cloaths, and other ne-
ceffaries, for the Englifh. foldiers in Ire-
land, the King feized them as they went,
armed and furnifhed the Englifh and Welfh
againft the Parliament. The reafons of
thefe are omitted by the penner of his Por-
traiture.
In November 1641, the Parliament
ftill fitting, the King comes for London,
is entertained by them in the greateft ftate
might be, and met on the way by fome
hundreds in gold chains ; and nothing is
now cried but '
Holanna, welcome home >
* your Majefty is welcome.' The Queen
perceiving a breach was likely to be be-
twixt the King and Parliament, thought
politickly to engage the city for him. He
gives the citizens good worJs, tells them,
he will give them their lands in Ireland
again, a promife he was never able to
perform,
of King CHARLES I, 229
perform, &c. As I remember at their
requeft, he alfo kept his Chriftmas at
Whitehall, intending otherways to have
kept it at Hampton-Court, and alfo knight-
ed fome of the Aldermen. At his return
from Scotland, he affirmed in a fpeech
lie made unto both Houfes, how he had
left that kingdom in as quiet and good
condition as eould be expe&ed. The
devil was in the crags of the Scots, if he
left them not contented, who gave them
whateyer they required, and figned what-
ever they defired or demanded, confirmed
as much as their large confeiences could
require.
But now in January 1641, began a
fea of misfortunes to fall upon us, and
overwhelm our long-continued happinefs,
by difagreement of the King and the two
Houfes of Parliament, and partly by the
daily coming to the Parliament Houfe of
many hundred citizens, fometimes in very
rude manner. True it is, the King dif-
liked thefe too frequent addreffes unto
both Houfes in fo tumultuous and un-
warrantable a manner : whereupon, fear-
ing the worft (as himfelf pretended) he
had a court of guard before Whitehall of
the trained-bands. He ha4 alfo many
diffolute gentlemen, and fome very civil,
that kept within Whitehall, with their
fwords by their fidgs, to be ready upon
Q^3 any
230 On the Life and Death
any fudden occafion. Verily, mens fears
now began to be great, and it was by
many perceived, the King began to fwell
with anger againft the proceedings of
Parliament, and to intend a war againft
them : fome fpeeches dropped from him
to that purpofe. It happened one day,
as fome of the ruder fort of citizens
came by Whitehall, one bufy citizen muft
needs cry, ' No Bifhops fome of the
gentlemen iflued out of Whitehall, either
to correÂ£t the faucinefs of the fool in
words, if they would ferve, elfe it feems
with blows : what palled on either fide
in words, none but themfelves knew;
the citizen being more tongue than fol-
dier, was wounded, and I have heard,
died of his wounds received at that time.
It hath been affirmed by very many, that in
or near unto that place where this fellow
was hurt and wounded, the late KING'S
head was cut off, the SCAFFOLD
(landing juft over that place.
Thofe people or citizens who ufed thus
to flock unto Weftminfter, were moft of
them men of mean or a middle quality
themfelves ; no Aldermen, Merchants, or
Common-Council Men, but fet on by
fome of better quality ; and yet moft of
them were either fuch as had publick
fpirits, or lived a more religious life than
the vulgar, and were ufually called Puri-
1 tans,
of King CHARLES I. 231
tans, and had fuffered under the tyranny
of the Bifhops : in the general they were
very honeft men, and well meaning.
Some particular fools, or others, per-
haps now and then got in amongft them,
greatly to the difadvantage of the more
fober. They were modeft in their appa-
rel, but not in language : they had the
hair of their heads, very few of them,
longer than their ears : whereupon it
came to pafs, that thofe who ufually with
their cries attended at Weftminfter, were,
by a nick name, called Roundheads. The
courtiers again wearing long hair and
locks, and always fworded, at laft were
called by thefe men Cavaliers : and fo after
that this broken language had been ufed a
while, all that adhered to the Parliament
were termed Roundheads ; all that took
part or appeared for his Majefty Cavaliers
;
few of the vulgar knowing the fenfe of
the word Cavalier. However, the pre-
fent hatred of the citizens were fuch un-
to gentlemen, efpecially courtiers, that
few durft come into the city ; or if they
did, they were fure to receive affronts,
and be abufed.
To fpeak freely and ingenuoufly, what
I then obferved of the city tumults, was
this. Firft, the fufferings of the citizens
who were any thing well devoted, had,
during all this King's reign, been fuch,
0^4 and
232 On the Life and Death
and fo great, being harrowed or abufed
continually, either with the High Com-
miflion Court, or the Star Chamber, that
as men in whofe breafts the fpirit of liber-
ty had fome place, they were even glad
to vent out their fighs and iufferings in
this rather tumultuous than civil man-
ner ; being affured, if ever this Parlia-
ment had been diflblved, they mult have
been racked, whipped, and ftripped by
the fnotty clergy, and other extravagant
courfes. And for any amendment which
they might expect from the King, they
too well knew his temper : that though
in a time of Parliament he often pro-
mifed to redrefs any grievances, yet the
beft friend he hath, cannot produce any
one aft of good for his fubjefts done
by him in the vacancy of a Parliament.
The lofers ufually have leave to fpeak,
and fo had the citizens.
All this Chriftmas 1641, there was no-
thing but private whifperings in Court,
and fecret councils held by the Queen,
and her party, with whom the King fat
in council very late many nights. What
was the particular refult of thofe clan-
deftine confutations, it will prefently ap -
pear.
January 4, 1641. By what finifler
council led, I know not, but the King
in perfon went into the then Lower
Houfe
of King CHARLES I. 233
Houfe of Parliament, where the Com-
mons r2t9 and for fome things he had
been informed of, demanded five of their
principal members, viz. Pimm, Hollis,
Hazlerigg, Hainbden, and Stroud. In
that book called his Portraiture, he af-
firms, he went to the Houfe of Com-
mons to demand juftice upon thofe five
members ; and faith, * He thought he
* had difcovered fome unlawful corre-
' fpondencies and engagements they had
* made to embroil his kingdoms.' He
confeffeth he miffed but little of pro-
curing fome writings, &c. to make his
thoughts good. So here is no evidence
againfl- thefe members, but his own
thoughts, as himfelf confeffeth. But
affuredly, had he demanded juftice of the
Houfe of Commons againfl them, and
proved his charge, he might have had
it ; but for himfelf to attach their bodies,
and be Judge alfo (as he intended) was
a matter moft unequal. And furely,
had it been in his power to have got
their bodies, he would have ferved thefe
members as he did Elliot, whom with-
out caufe he committed to the tower,
and never would either releafe him, or
fhew caufe of his commitment, till death.
All that time he had a guard with him
at the doors of the Houfe of Parliament,
confifting of many gentlemen with hal-
berts
_j4 On the Life and Death
berts and fvvords. Truly, I did not hear
there was any incivility offered by thofe
gentlemen then attending unto any mem-
ber of the Houfe, his Majefty having given
them ftridt commands to the contrary.
This rafh aftion of the King's loft him
his Crown : for as he was the firft of
Kings that ever, or fo imprudently, brake
the privileges by his entrance into the
Houfe of Commons aflcmbled in Parlia-
ment; fo by that unparalleled demand
of his, he utterly loft himfelf, and left
fcarce any poflibility of reconcilement ; he
not willing to truft them, nor they him,
who had fo often failed them. It was
my fortune that very day to dine in
Whitehall, and in that room where the
halberts, newly brought from the tower,
were lodged, for ufe of fuch as attended
the King to the Houfe of Commons.
Sir Peter Wich, ere we had fully dined,
came into the room I was in, and brake
open the chefts wherein the arms were,
which frighted us all that were there.
However, one of our company got out
of doors, and prefently informed fome
members, that the King was preparing
to come unto the Houfe $ elfe I believe
all thofe members, or fome of them, had
been taken in the Houfe. All that I
could do further was prefently to be
gone. But it happened alfo the fame
of King CHARLES L 235
day, that fqme of my neighbours were
at the court of guard at Whitehall, unto
whom I related the King's prefent defign,
and conjured them to defend the Parlia-
ment and members thereof, in whofe
well or ill doing confifted our happinefs
or misfortune : they promifed affiftance if
need were, and I believe would have
ftoutly flood to it for defence of the Par-
liament, or members thereof. The King
loft his reputation exceedingly by this
l}is improvident and unadvifed demand
:
yet notwithftanding this his failing, fo
wilful and obftinate he was in purfu-
ance of that prepofterous courfe he in-
tended, and fo defirous to compafs the
bodies of thefe five members, that the
next day he pofted and trotted into the
city to demand the members there. He
convened a meeting at Guildhall. The
Common Council afTembled : but mum
could he get there, for the word London-
Deny was then frefh in every man's
mouth.
But whereas the author of the King's
Portraiture complains, < That the info-
* lency of the tumults was fuch, that his
' Majefty's perfon was in danger in the
* ftreets.' This is a very untruth : for
notwithftanding his Majefty dined in the
city that day he required the five mem-
bers pf the citizens, yet he had no in-
civility
236 On the Life and Death
civility in the leaft meafure offered unto
his perfon ; only many cried out as he
paffed the ftreets, 1
Sir, let us have our
* juft liberties, we defire no more/ Un-
to which he feveral times anfvvered, '
They
' fhouid,' &c.
An honejft citizen, as I remember,
threw into his coach a new fermon, the
text whereof was, as I now remember,
' To thy tents, O Ifrael.' Indeed the citi-
zens (unto their everlafting honour be it
fpoken) did with much refolution pro^
te6l the five members : and many thou-
fands were willing to facrifice their lives
for defence of the Parliament, and the
feveral members thereof.
The tenth of January approached and
came : upon which day the five demanded
members were brought into the Houfe of
Cpmmons with as much triumph as
could be exprefied, feveral companies of
trained bands marchipg to the Parliament
to aftift if need were. There were upon
the River Thames I know not how many
barges full of failqrs, having fome guns
ready charged, if occafion were : and
thefe alfo came in multitudes to ferve
the Parliament. A word dropped out of
the King's mouth a little before, which
loft him the love of the feamen. Some
being in conference with his Majefty,
acquainted him, that he was loft in the
afteÂ£lion
of King CHARLES L 237
affettion of the feamen, for they intended
to petition the houfe, &c. * I wonder/
quoth the King, ' how I have loft the
4
affe&ion of thole water-rats.' A word
fure that flipped out of his mouth un-
advifedly ; for all men muft and do know,
that the (hips of England, and our va-
liant failors, are the very ftrength of Eng-
land.
His Majefty finding nothing thrived
on his fide, and feeing the abundant af-
fection of the commonalty in general for
the Parliament, the aforefaid tenth of
January 1 64 1, went unto Hampton-Court,
and never after could by entreaty, or
otherwife, be drawn to come unto his Par-
liament, though they in moft humble wife,
and by many and feveral addrefles, ex-
ceedingly defired it. One misfortune fol-
lows another: for the 25th of February,
1641, the Queen went into Holland, and
afterwards the King into Yorfhire. There
was at this time a fufficient magazine
of arms in Hull, being the remainder
of thofe employed again ft the Scots. The
Parliament fent down a member of their
own, one Sir John Hotham, to take care
of them ; who undertook, and alfo did
maintain the town, and preferve the arms
therein for the Parliament. Although his
Majefty, in April 1642, came unto the
walls of the town to require them, yet
couid
23S On the Life and Death
could he neither procure arms, or admit-
tance into the town.
The Earl of Warwick, exceedingly be-
loved of the feamen, fecured the navy;
fo that in few days the Parliament had
ftore of arms for land foldiers, and plenty
of ftout fhips for their fea occafions. His
Majefty in the mean time being deftitute
both of the affe&ions of his people, and
means to fupply an army, which it was
perceived he intended fhortly to raife, re-
turned from viewing Hull unto York.
The Parliament having perfeÂ£t intelli-
gence, and being allured he would raife
an army againft them, began to con-
fider of their prefent condition; whom
to make their General ; how to raife
men and money for their own, and
commonwealth's, defence. But one would
have bleffed himfelf to fee what running
and trotting away here was both of Lords
and Commons unto his Majefty. I do
aflure you a very thin houfe was left
:
of Lords who remained, Efiex the peo-
ple's darling was chief; a moft noble
foul, and generally well efteemed : he in
this exigency was by both houfes nomi-
nated and voted the Parliament's Gene-
ral. I do herein admire at the wonder-
ful providence of Almighty God, who
put it into the peoples hearts to make
this man General, this very Earl, this
of King CHARLES L 239
good man, who had fuffered beyond be-
lief, by the partial judgment of King
James ; who to fatisfy the letchery of a
iuftful Scot, took away Effex's wife (being
a lewd woman) for one Carr, alias Somer-
fetj fhe pretending EfTex was Frigidits in
Corfu, and old Jemmy believing it.
Had EfTex refufed to be General, our
eaufe in all likelihood had funk in the
beginning, we having 'never a Noble-
man at that time, either willing or ca-
pable of that honour and preferment:
indeed, fcarce any of them were fit to be
trufted. So that God raifed up EfTex
to be a fcourge for his fon, whofe father
had fo unjuftly abufed him. And for
the Countefs, fhe had abundance of for-
row ere fhe died, and felt the divine hand
of heaven againft her; for fhe was un-
capable of coition at leaft a dozen years
ere fhe died, having an impediment in
that very member fhe had fo much de-
lighted in and abufed : and this I had
from the mouth of one who faw her
when bowelled. For Somerfet himfelf,
he died a poor man, contemptible and
defpifed of every man ; and yet I never
heard any ill of that Scotchman, except
in this alone bufinefs concerning the Earl
of EfTex, and his wife. In this fummer
the citizens lifted themfelves plentifully
for
24Â° Ox T & E LifÂ£ and Death
for foldiers . Horfe and arms were provided,
and the Lord knows how many trea-
cherous knaves had command in this firft
expedition in the Parliament army : fo that
if God himfclf had not been on our fide,
we muft of necefnty have perifhed.
The youth of the City of London
made up the major part of Effex's in-
fantry. His horfes were good, but the
riders unlkilful : for they were taken up
as they came and lifted, or offered them-
felves unto the fervice. The truth is,
the Parliament were at that time glad to
fee any mens willingnefs and forwardnefs
unto their fervice ; therefore they pro-
mifed largely, and made fome pleafing
votes ; fo that the plate and monies of
the citizens came tumbling into Guild-
hall upon the publick faith.
His Majefty in the interim, and at
that time, was neceffitated for money
and arms extreamly, having no magazine
to command, but thofe of the northern
counties yea, into what other county
foever he came (and he traverfed many)
he was fo courteous, as he made fhift to
feize their arms, and carry them along
for his ufe, pretending for the fafety of
the people, and his perfon.
The King had lain moft part at York,
or rambled into fome other counties near
adjacent until Auguft, and done little to
any
of King CHARLES t $4t
amy piirpofe ; for the feverai counties were
generally nothing inclinable to his pur-
pofe : in moft whereof, and in every
county he came in, he rather received
petty affronts than fupport : yet at laft
he came to Nottingham, and there fef
up his STANDARD (with a full refo-
lution for war) the 2 2d of Auguft, 1642,
under this conftellation, having fome few
horfe with him; but in great expefta-
tion of more aid from the Welch, &C*

The heralds, or at leaft thofe who theti
Were with the King, Were ignorant how,

242 On the Life and Death
and in what manner to fet up the Stan-
dard Royal : they therefore hung it out
in one of the turrets, or upper rooms
of Nottingham Caftle, within the Caflle
Wall. King Richard the Third fet up
his Standard there, &c. His Majefty dif-
liked his Standard was placed within the
caftle. He faid it was to be placed in an
open place, where all men that would
might freely come unto it, and not in a
prifon : they therefore carried it, at his
command, without the caftle, towards or
into the park there adjoining, into an
open place and eafy of accefs. When
they came to fix it in the ground, they
perceived it was a meer rock ftone, fo
that they with daggers and knives made
a fmall hole for the Standard to be put
in ; but all would not ferve ; men were
inforced for the prefent to fupport it with
the ftrength of their arms and bodies ;
which gave great occafion unto fome
gentlemen there prefent, to give a very fad
judgment on the King's fide, and to divine
long beforehand, that he would never do
any good by arms. I have alfo heard,
that in eight or ten days he had not thirty
attended the Standard, or lifted them-
felves.
All the remainder of his life after this
Auguft 22, 1642, was a meer labyrinth
of ibrrow, a continued and daily misfor-
2 tune,
of King CHARLES I.
243
tune, unto which it feems providence had
ordained him from the very entrance of
his reign. His wars are wrote by feve-
ral learned hands, unto whom I refer the
reader. I (hall only repeat a few more
things of him, and then conclude. Fa-
vourites he had three ; Buckingham ftabbed
to death; William Laud, and Thomas
Earl of Strafford, both beheaded. Bi-
fhops and Clergymen, whom he moll
favoured, and wholly advanced, and oc-
cafionally ruined, he lived to fee their
bifhopricks fold, the Bifhops themfelves
fcorned, and all the whole clergy of his
party and opinion quite undone.
The Englifh Noblemen he cared not
much for, but only to ferve his own turns
by them : yet fuch as had the unhappi-
hefs to adventure their lives and fortunes
for him, he lived to fee them and their
families ruined, only for his fake. Pity
it is many of them had not ferved a more
fortunate mafter, and one more grateful.
The Scots, his countreymen, on whom
he beftowed fo many favours, he lived to
fee them in arms againft himfelf ; to fell
him for more money than the Jews did
Chrift, and themfelves to be handfomely
routed, and fold for knaves and Haves.
They made their beft market of him at all
times, changing their affection with his
fortune.
R 2 The
.244 On the Life and Death
The old Prince of Orange he almoft
beggared, and yet to no purpofe, the
Parliament one time or other getting all
arms and ammunition which ever came
over unto him. It is confidently averred,
if the King had become ablolute here in
England, Orange had been King, &c.
The city of London, which he had fo
fore oppreffed and flighted, he lived to fee
thoufands of them in arms againft him
;
and they to thrive, and himfelf confume
unto nothing. The Parliament, which
he fo abhorred, and formerly fcorned, he
lived to know was fuperior unto him
;
and the fcorns and flights he had ufed
formerly to Elliot, and others, he faw
now returned upon himfelf in folio.
With Spain he had no perfeft corre-
fpondency, fmce his being there ; lefs after
he fuffered their fleet to perifh in his
havens ; leaft of all, after he received an
Ambaflador from Portugal ; the Spaniard
ever upbraiding him with falfhood, and
breach of promife. Indeed, the nativities
of both Kings were very contrary.
With France he had no good amity;
the Proteftants there abhorring his leger-
demain and treachery unto Rochelle ; the
Papifts as little loving or trufting him,
for fome hard meafure offered unto thofe
of their religion in England. He cun-
ningly
of King CHARLES I. 245
ningly would labour to pleafe all, but in
effe6t gave fatisfaftion to none.
Denmark could not endure him; fent
him little or no afliftance, if any at all
:
befides, the old King fufpefted another
matter; and made a query in his drink.
The Swede extremely complained of him
for nonperformance of fome fecret con-
tract betwixt them, and uttered high
words againft him.
The Proteftant PRINCES of Germany
loathed his very name, &c.
The Portugal King and he had little to
do ; yet in one of his own letters to the
Queen, though he acknowledges the Por-
tugal's courtefy unto him, yet faith, that he
would give him an anfwer unto a thing of
concernment that fhould fignify nothing.
The Hollanders being only courteous
for their own ends, and as far as his money
would extend, furnifhed him with arms at
fuch rates as a Turk might have had them
elfewhere : but they neither loved or cared
for him in his profperity, or pitied him in
his adverfity ; which occafioned thefe words
to drop from him, ' If he ere came to his
(
throne, he would make Hans Butter- box
* know, he Ihould pay well for his fifhing,
c
and fatisfy for old knaveries/ &c.
In conclufion. He was generally un-
fortunate in the world, in the efteem both
R 3 of
246 On the Life and Death
of friends and enemies : his friends ex-
claim on his breach of faith ; his enemies
would fay, he could never be faft enough
bound. He was more lamented as he was
a King, than for any affe&ion had unto
his perfon as a man.
He had feveral opportunities offered
him for his reftoring. Firft, by feveral
treaties, all ending in fmoke, by his own
perverfenefs. By feveral opportunities
and vi6lories which he profecuted not.
Firft, when Briftol was cowardly fur-
rendered by Fines : had he then come un-
to London, all had been his own ; but
loitering to no purpofe at Gloucefter, he
was prefently after well banged by EfTex.
When in the weft, viz. Cornwall, he
worfted EfTex : had he then immediately
hafted to London, his army had been
without doubt mafters of that city ; for
Manchefter was none of his enemy at
that time, though he was General of the
affociated counties.
Or had he, ere the Scots came into
England, commanded Newcaftle to have
marched fouthward for London, he could
not have miffed obtaining the city, and
then the work had been ended.
Or when in 1645, ^e na^ taken Lei-
cefter, if then he had fpeedily marched
for London, I know not who could have
refilled him : but his camp was fo over-
charged
t
of King CHARLES I. 247
charged with plunder and Irifli whores,
there was no. marching.
Amongft many of his misfortunes, this
I relate was not the leaft; viz. when
the Parliament laft time were to fend
him proportions unto the Ille of Wight,
he had advice, &c. that the only way,
and that there was no other means re-
maining upon earth to make himfelf
happy, and fettle a firm peace betwixt
himfelf and Parliament, and to bring him
out of thraldom, but by receiving our
Commiffioners civilly ; to fign whatever
proportions they brought ; and above all,
to make hafte to London, and to do all
things fpeedily : he was willing, and he
promifed fairly to perform thus much.
Our Commiffioners were no fooner come,
but one of them, an old fubtil fox, had
every night .
private and long conference
with him ; to whom, when his Majefty
had communicated his intentions of fign-
ing the propofitions, he utterly difliked
the defign, and told him plainly, ' He
* fhould come unto his Parliament upon
* eafier terms ; for he affured him, the
6
Ploufe of Lords were wholly his, and
* at his devotion/ This old man knew
that well enough, himfelf being one of
them : and in the Houfe of Commons he
had fuch a ftrong party, th^t the propo-
fUiqns fhould be mitigated, and made

248 On the Life and Death
more eafy and more fit for him to fign,
Upon this, the old Lord was to be Trea-
furer apud Gracas Cakndas, and a cow-
ardly fon of his, Secretary of State. This
was the laft and greateft misfortune ever
befel him, to be thus ruled and fopled by
that backfliding old Lord, who was never
fortunate either to Parliament or com-
monwealth. But by this aftion, and the
like, you may perceive how eafily he was
ever convertible unto the worfer advice.
In like nature, the former time of pro.-
pofitions lent unto hin), when of himfelf
he was inclinable to give the Parliament
fatisfa&ion unto their proportions, the
Scots Commiffiqners pretending what their
cold afFeftionate country would do for
him : upon this their difTembling, he had
fo little wit, as tQ flight the Englifh, and
confide in the Scots, though he well knew
they only had been the fole means of
ruining him and his pqfterity by their
juggling, felling, and betraying him.
Whilft he was in prifon at Carifbrook-
Caftle, horfes were laid at feveral ftages,
both ir\ Suflfex and Kent, purpofely to
have conveyed him to the Kentifh force?,
Â£nd to have been in the head of them, and
with the revolted fhips, if he could have
pfcaped ; and he was fo near efcaping, that
his legs and body, even unto the breaft,
\yere out at the window: tut whether
fear
of King CHARLES I. 249
fear furprifed him, or, as he faid himfelf,
he could not get his body out of the
window, being full-chefted ; he tarried
behind, &c. and efcaped not. Many
fuch misfortunes attended him ; fo that
one may truly fay, he was Regum infceli-
cijfimus. Some affirm before his death fe-
yeral prodigies appeared. All I obferved
a long time before, was, that there ap-
peared almoft in every year after 1664*
feveral parelia, or mock-funs ; fometimes
two, fometimes three. So alfo mock-

greateft prodigies I ever obferved or feared.
He was beheaded January 30, 1648. The
figure of that moment is as followeth.
250 On the Life, and Death
After the execution, his body was car-
ried to Windfor, and buried with Henry
the VHIth, in the fame vault where his
body was lodged. Some, who faw him
emhowelled, affirm, had he not come
unto this untimely end, he might have
lived, according unto nature, even unto
the height of old age.
Many have curioufly enquired who it
was that cut off his head : I have no per-
million to fpeak of fuch things ; only
thus much I fay, he that did it, is as
valiant and refolute a man as lives, and
one of a competent fortune -f.
King Charles being dead, and fome
foolifh citizens going a whoring after his
pifture or image, formerly fet up in the
Old Exchange ; the Parliament made
bold to take it down, and to engrave in
its place thefe words
:
Exit Tyrannies Regum ultimus> Anno Li-
bertatis Anglia rejiitutce primoy Anno Dom.
1648. Jan. 30.
For my part I do believe he was not
the worft, but the moil unfortunate of
Kings.

Several

Several Englilh Prophecies, relat-
ing to the Life and Death of
Charles Stuart, late King of
Britain.
WE ufually fay prophecies and ora-
cles are beft underftood, when
they are performed ; many having com-
plained of the ambiguity of oracles, and
their ambodextrous interpretations -
y as
many alfo finding fault with the obfcure-
nefs of prophecies, imagining no mortal
men can give the proper ienfe of any
oracle or prophecy, except tadued from
above with the fame divine fpirits as were
given unto the firft authors. Were I to
meddle with divine prophecies, I could
tranfcend a volume in difcourfe of this
fubjeft ; but I have confined my prefent
endeavours in the enfuing treatife, only
to manifeft unto the whole world, and
this nation principally, the certain and
unqueftionable events, of very many Eng-
lifh prophecies, long fince delivered unto
us, and ftill remaining amongft us, which
have fo clearly and manifeftly declared
the aÂ£lions of thefe prefent times wherein
we live, and with that lively portraiture,
that it were the higheft of incredulties to
queftion
252 On the Life and Death
queftion their abilities in the gift of pro-
phefying, or by unneceflary and ambigu-
ous queries to make the world believe
there can be any other interpretation
rendered of their fayings, than fuch as
we have vifibly with our eyes beheld,
even in this very age and time we now
live in. And if any curious impertinent
ihall be fo nice as to queftion by what
divine fury, or heavenly rapture infufed
into them, either by dreams, vifions, or
any other no&urnal revelation, thefe
reverend perfons became fo wife, fo fore-
knowing : I muft firft intreat fuch criticks
to acquaint me how, and by what means
either the Sybils, or many others, and
efpecially Balaam the Prophet, came fo
truly to prophefy either of Chrift, as the
moft learned believe he did, or of the
kingdom of the Jews, or of both, in
Numb. xxiv. ver. 17. * Then fhall come a
* ftar out of Jacob, and a fcepter fhall
* arife out of Ifrael.' I willingly confent
with the feveral expolitions of the learned
upon thofe words : yet do think it no
herefy, if I fay Balaam intended, by the
ftar there mentioned, Jefus Chrift ; and
by the fcepter, that the people or nation
of the Jews, fhould in future time be-
come a great and mighty people, and have
Kings to rule over them as other nations
had at that prefent j whereas the Jews were
of King CHARLES I. 253
only governed by Mofes at that time
:
yet we know Balaam was not of the peo-
ple of the Jews ; and yet in the 1 6th
verfe of that chapter he plainly faith,
* He heard the words of God, and knew
* the knowledge of the moft High/ We
muft acknowledge that he prophefied very
truly; for the fcripture, againft whofe
evidence there is no appeal to be made,
confirms it. But if Balaam loved the
ways of unrighteoufnefs, and laboured
with that continued infirmity of the
clergy and priefthood, viz. covetoufnefs,
let us lament and pity human kind, that
fo excellent a man as he in many things,
fhould blemifh all his rare parts, with
thofe filthy, but pleafmg minerals, gold
and filver.
If God Almighty, in thofe times of fo
great darknefs or heathenifm, did not
leave fome kindoms deftitute of prophetick
fpirits, though the true caufes by which
they did prophefy, lie concealed unto
pofterity, or are manifefted unto very few
at prefent living ; fhall we now think,
that in the pureft times of Chriftianity*
God either hath been, or is lefs merciful
than unto former ages he was ? or that he
is not as able or willing to infufe into
fome Chriftians the fpirit of prophecy as
into fome heathens of old ? How truly
did Homer deliver, that prophecy of iEneas,
many
254 ^N THE Life and DeIath
many hundred years before it came to
pafs
:
At Domus IEne<z ciinBis dominabitur Oris,
Et Nati natorum, & qui nafcentur ab Mis*
A prophecy it was of the greatnefs of the
Roman empire which we all know was
fully verified. How true is alfo that of
Seneca
:
â Venient Amiis
Seculafens, quibus Oceanus
Vinculo, rerum laxet^ &c.
Which was a prophecy of the difcovery of
the Weft-Indies and America, never known
to the ancients, and to us not above one
hundred and fifty years fince. But I
leave mentioning of heathen prophets, &c.
What fhall we fay of that prophecy of
Henry the Vlth, King of England, which
he delivered fo pofitively upon Henry the
Vllth, then a boy, and holding water
Unto him :
* This is the lad or boy/ faith
he, 1
that fhall enjoy the crown for which
'we ftrive/
Or of David Upaft or Unanthony, who
jnany years fmce prophefied of the pulling
down of Charing-Crofs. His prophecy
was printed 1558 ; the words are thefe
:
To
of King CHARLES I. 255
To tell the truth, many one would wonder,
Chartng-Grofs ihall be broken afunder
:
P. Shall preach, R. mall reach, S. (hall ftand
R. Signifies Round-head. P. Pref-
bytery. S. The Soldier, &c.
Charing-Crofs, we know, was pulled
down 1647, in June, July, and Auguft,
part of the ftones converted to pave
before White- Hall. I have feen knive-
hafts made of fome of the ftones,^ which
being well polifhed, looked like marble.
But I leave further determination of
thefe things unto fome other pen,, or
difcourfe, and come unto the prefent in-
tended difcourfe itfelf, wherein I ihall
make it very clearly to appear, that all,
or moft of our ancient Englifh, Welch,
and Saxon prophecies, had relation to
Charles Stuart, late King of 'England,
unto his reign, his aftions, life and- deaths
and unto the now prefent times wherein
we live, and unto no other preceding
-King or times whatfoever 5 which I prove
only by this undeniable argument, viz.
no King or Queen reigning in this nation
or kingdom did ever write or ftyle him
or herfelf, King or "Queen of Britain,
before King James, who being naturally
King of Scotland, and fucceffively of Eng-
land and Wales, was the firit that ever
either
256 On the Life and Death
either really was King of all Britain, or
that did fo entitle himfelf -
y nor was ever
any King crowned in white apparel but
King Charles. Befides there is a pro-
phecy extant, and printed long before
Queen Elizabeth died, viz.
When HEMPE is fponne,
England's donne.
O R,
When HEMPE is come and alfo gon,
Scotland and England fhall be one.
Which words intimate, that both Henry
the Vlllth, Edward the Vlth, Mary,
Philip, and Elizabeth, Kings and Queens
of England, muft firft have reigned, be*
fore Merlin's Prophecy could take place
:
in King James both nations were united,
and not before. Let me alfo add unto
this, a very ancient prophecy of the
Welch, viz.
Koronog fab Ane a wn& ddiwedh ar y
daroganeu.
In Englifh thus 2
The fonne of Ann crowned, ends all our
of King CHARLES I. 257
We never had yet any King whofe
mother's name was Anne ; but King
Charles's mother was Anne, fifter to the
King of Denmark, late deceafed.
The putting to death of the late King
was prophefied of above eighty years be-
fore it was done, by Noftradamus : the
book itfelf was printed about 1578, as I
remember in century the 9th : thefe are
the words,
Senat de Londres mettront a mort leur
Roy, viz.
The Senate or Parliament of London,
ftiall put to death their King.
Thefe examples (hew, that chriftians
have had the fpirit of prophecy, and
foretold plainly many ages before, what
fhould fu&eed.
The moft fignificant of all our Englifh
prophecies, is that of Ambrofe Merlin,
which I have made choice of in the firft
place, repeating orderly a verfe of the
prophecy, and then how it was fulfilled.
S A Pro-
[ 2 5 8 ]
A Prophecy of the White King,
wrote by Ambrofe Merlin, nine
hundred years Unce, concern-
ing CHARLES the late
KING.
' TT THEN the Lion of Rightful-
c
VV nefle is dead, then lhall arife a
* White King in Brittaine, firft flying,
' and after riding, after ligging downe,
' and in this ligg down, he fhall be lymed,
* and after that he fhall be led/
We have feen with our own eyes, and
thoufands befides, firft King James, who
reigned peaceably, and was therefore called
Jacofa/s Pacifiais, is dead, viz. that ftyling
himfelf King of Great-Britain, ^and reign-
ing two and twenty years, died 1625, the
27th of March. Many affirmed he had the
pifture of a lion on his breaft or fide
;
but it is probable he had fome eminent
natural mole there, which might caufe
that error ; becaufe in his nativity he had
both Saturn and Mars in Leone. In re-
gard of the great tranquillity and peace
we enjoyed in King James's time, and
the little or no blood fhed in his reign ;
and in confideration of the propagation,
of King CHARLES i. 259
and free admittance of the gofpel all over
this kingdom, he was rightly by the Pro-
phet ftyled, < The LION of Rightful*
' neffe.' But if the Prophet had given
him the name of Lion in any other
fenfe, he had notorioufly failed; being
King James was the moft pufillanimous
Prince of fpirit that ever we read of, and
the leaft addifted unto martial difcipline.
But in judgment either in things divine
or human (whilft fober or unbiased) the
moft acute and piercing of any Prince
either before or fince. He was admo-
nifhed of his death by a dream. He
dreamed that his mafter Buchanan ap-r.
peared unto him in his fleep, and gave
him thefe two verfes. I thought good
for the rarity thereof to repeat them.
Sexte verere Deum, tibi vitce terminus inflate
Cum tua candentiJiagrat carbunculus igne.
The Englifli whereof is
;
Thou James the Vlth of that name,
King of Scots, fear God, the term of
thy life is near or at hand, when thy
carbuncle-ftone burns in the hot fire,
The King told his bed-chamber men,
and fome other Lords, of thefe verfes next
morning, relating them really, and averred
S 2 i\Q
260 On the Life and Death
he made not the verfes, nor could his
mafter Buchanan ever almoft get him to
make a Latin verfe. The fuccefs was
thus : the King had a very large and fair
carbuncle ftone ufually fet in his hat ;
and we have feen him pi&ured many
times with fuch a carbuncle fixed to his
hat. But thus it happened : fitting by
the fire, not long after, this great car-
buncle fell out of his hat, and into the
fire : a Scottifh Lord took it up, and
obferved the King fickened, and alfo died
very fhortly after.
After King James was dead, Charles
Stuart, his then only fon, was proclaimed
King of Great Britain, by a general con-
fent of the people, his title being unques-
tionable. The occafion of the Prophet's
calling him White King, was this : The
Kings of England anciently did wear the
day of their coronation purple cloaths,
being a colour only fit for Kings : both
Queen Elizabeth, King James, and all
their anceftors did wear that colour the
day of their coronation, as any may per-
ceive by the records of the wardrobes.
Contrary unto this cuftom, and led unto
it by the indireft and fatal advice of Wil-
liam Laud, Archbifhop of Canterbury,
he was perfuaded to apparel himfelf the
day of his coronation in a white gar-
ment. There were fome dehorted him frpm
wearing
of King CHARLES I. 261
wearing the white apparel, but he obfti-
nately refufed their counfel. Canterbury-
would have it as an apparel reprefenting
the King's innocency, or I know not what
other fuperftitious device of his. And
of this there is no queftion to be made,
myfelf, though not occularly feeing him
that day, yet have had it related verbally
by above twenty, whofe eyes beheld it;
one or two were workmen that carried
his Majefty's apparel that day ; fo that I
challenge all the men upon earth living,
to deny his wearing white apparel that
day of his coronation, &c. It is alfo
reported, and I believe it to be true, that
fuch was his hafte to have the crown
upon his head, that he had not patience
to wait the coming of the Archbifhop,
whofe office it was to do it, but impa-
tiently in great hafte, he placed the crown
upon his head with his own hands ; which
moved the Spanifh AmbafTador, who was
then prefent, to fay, ' The King's putting
* the crown upon his head fo rafhly with
â¬
his own hands, was an ill omen.'

King Charles fummons a Parliament,
November 1640: the troubles of Scot-
land arifing in 1641, he left the Englifh
Parliament fitting, and went in perfon
S 3 himfelf
262 Otf the Life and Death
himfelf to fettle the difturbed affairs of
Scotland. He came home to London
about November, and was himfelf and
Queen royally entertained by the citizens,
who cried then ' Hofanna,' &c. But fee
how fuddenly many of the fame city cry
* Crucify, crucify/ For lo, in January
1 64 1, the citizens of London, and other
rude people, in great numbers flock down
unto the Parliament, and affront the King,
the Bifhops, and other temporal Lords
:
which rudenefs and faucinefs of theirs,
as himfelf pretended, moved him, the 10th
of January, 1641, firft to fly or remove
unto Hampton-Court, then to Windfor,
then into Kent, from thence into York-
shire ; fo that all the remainder of his
life, until he furrendered his perfon to
the Scots, was running and flying from
one place to another. I muft ingenuoufly
acknowledge, my eyes were witnefs of
very great rudenefs in the citizens, and
of as great a defect of civility and judg-
ment in fome courtiers, unto thofe ill-
bred citizens.
* And after riding.'
The firft horfe his JVIajefty raifed, were
in Yorkfhire, and thefe in or about July,
Auguft, and September, 1642, pretend-
ing they were for a guard for his perfon
:
from
of King CHARLES h 263
from which time, until the very time he
rendered himfelf to his countrymen the
Scots, which was May, 1646, he had an
army of horfe, and was frequently him-
felf amongft them : though it is not once
reported himfelf ever charged, as he was
fometimes invited unto it by the Lord
Charles Gerrard, a mod gallant man,
who would fay unto him many times,
* CHARGE, SIR/ &c. And indeed,
who would have loft three kingdoms,
without firft lofing fome blood in the
quarrel
!
* After ligging downe.'
From the time of his own voluntary
rendition unto the Scots, until his dying
day, he was never in the head of an
army, but did ligg down or lie flill, and
was carried up and down from one place
to another as a prifoner : yet had he
very great liberty until he difcharged him-
felf of his own word or parol at Hampton-
Court, and immediately efcaped to the
Me of Wight.
â¢ In this ligg down he fhall be lymed/
During the time of his imprifonment,
or from that time the Scots fold his perfon

S 4 it

it may properly be faid, * In this ligg down
â¢ he fhall be lymed/ that is, he was at-
tempted and allured firft by one fide, then
another ; or he was feveral times, and by
feveral occafions, tempted or treated with-
al, (every one thinking themfelves fureft
who poffeffed his perfon) fometimes by
the Scots, other times by the Englifh, as
well Parliament as army : but notwith-
standing all overtures, his perfon was ftill
fafe looked unto, &c.
4
And after that he fhall be led/
After that propofitions had been pre-
fented unto him at Hampton-Court, and
laft of all at the Ifle of Wight, he re-
futing to fign them, or give fuch fatis-
faclion as was required; from that time,
viz. from December, 1648, until his
death, he was led, viz. he was more
ftriclly guarded and imprifoned than ever
;
nor from that time had the benefit of his
liberty as formerly he had had, but was
removed firft to one caftle, then to ano-
ther; then to Windfor, then laft of all
to Whitehall. So that moft properly he
may be faid to be now led. For I dare
fwear he went and came into all thefe
places moft unwillingly.
1
And
of King CHARLES I. 265
* And there (hall be (hewed whether
' there be another King/
Since King Charles did retreat from his
Parliament, they on the behalf of the
commonwealth afted as Kings, ufing re-
gal command, railing armies, monies,
taxes, & quid non, breaking his Majefty's
Great Seal, nlaking a new one of their own,
and fmce have altered the frame of govern-
ment, and converted monarchy into a
commonwealth.
* Then fhall bee gadered togather much
' folk, and he fhall take helpe for him.'
How many of the nobility, gentry, and
clergy, and what numbers of the com-
monalty affifted him, we know, and
they who were his affiftants do well to
their coft remember : for indeed, the
greateft part of the nobility, and gentry,
and priefthood, moft cordially and unani-
moufly followed him, and affifted him to
the hazard of their lives, and confumption
of eftates. And we know, even whilft
he was in Carifbrook-Caftle, what a re-
bellion was raifed by Goring, and others,
&c. in Kent and Effex 1648, befides that
great army of Scots and Englifh routed
i\\ Lancafhire.
< And
266 On the Life and Death
' And there fhall be merchandife of men,
' as of an horfe or an ox.'
This part of the prophecy was exaftly
verified in King Charles's, or the White
King's Time; for in 1648, after the de-
feat of the wretched Scots in Lancafhire,
the Englifh merchants did give money
for as many of the common foldiers as
were worth any thing, and fent them for
Barbadoes and other foreign plantations.
Some were fold dear, others cheap, ac-
cording to the quality of the perfon or
profeffion he was of. It is reported, that
many of thofe miferable wretches, fmce
their being at the Barbadoes, do fay,
they have left hell, viz. Scotland, and
are arrived into heaven. There was in
1644, 1645, &c. exchanging of foldiers
and prifoners ; but in 1648, abfolute
merchandifmg of mens bodies, and not
before. What price the Scots were fold
for, I know not : he that gave but
twelve pence apiece for any of that nafly
people, gave too much.
â¢ There fhall bee fought helpe, and there
* fhall none arife, but bed for head.'
What Prince or State of Europe, was
not attempted fmce 1642, unto 1648, to
alM his late Majefty ? but in vain. Pro-
vidence
of King CHARLES L 267
vidence being not to be deluded by any
mortal man : each man that affifted, had
only a bed for his head, viz. a grave or
piece of earth for his burial. And how
many royal Englifh families, both of
gentry and nobles, I pity to relate, who
have mifcarried for his fake.
* And then fhall one gone there the fun
* arifeth, another there the fun gone
f
downe/
Intimating no more, but that the fear
and fadnefs of thofe times fhould be fuch,
as fhould caufe feveral perfons to leave this
kingdom or nation, for their fafety, as
many nobles and gentry, who took part
with him did, fome going to Holland,
others to France, others to feveral coun-
tries, as their fancies or occafions led
them : or it may import his Majefty
fhould go Eaftward or North-Eaft, as he
did when he went firft to the Scots ; and
the Queen before went Weftward or
South-Weft, viz. to France. I pity ex-
ceedingly the fad condition of many noble
families, which ftill to this day continue,
in foreign parts, poor, beggarly, and in
a moft uncomfortable condition.
1
After this, it (hall be faid by Britain,
' (King is King,) King is no King: after
'this hee fhall raife his head, and he
* fhall be taken to be a King.'
After
268 On the Life and Death
After he went to the Scots, and whilft
he was in durance, he was treated with
both by England and Scotland, as a
King. Yet afterwards it appeared he had
not the power of a King, to conclude
any thing : nay, afterward our Parlia-
ment made a vote,
* That no Addreffes fhould be made unto
' him any more.'
But that vote was repealed, and addreffes
were made, but to no purpofe. So that
the Prophet faid well, ' Sometimes King
;
* after, King is no King/ &c.
c
Bee many things to done, but wife men
* reading, &c. and then fhall a range of
* gleeds, and ever each hath bereaving,
* he fhall have it for his owne.'
I conceive this intimates no more than
the multiplicity of affairs in thefe times
:
but whether by the range of gleeds, he
intend either the Parliament themfelves,
or the army, or the Parliament's fub-
officers, I know not. I conceive here are
fome words wanting in the copy, which
might lead to explain thefe words, viz.
' And hee fhall have it for his owne/
Unlefs
of King CHARLES I. 269
Unlefs it be intended, thofe meant by the
range of gleeds, viz. great oppreffors, or
thole who then rule or command, fhall
have all for their own ; the Latin copy-
hath no more, but
Pofl hcec erit tempus mihomm> & quod
qui/que rapuerit, pro fuo habebit.
Viz. After thefe things, it (hall be a
time of kites or gleeds, and what every
man can get or purloin, he will take it
for his own. And this feems to be the
genuine fenfe of it : for how many very
poor men have we known to arrive unto
great eflates, fince thefe times, even to
thoufands a year and more ? Some, I
know myfelf, were men of very mean
fortunes in the beginning of this Parlia-
ment, that are now fo elevated, fo proud,
fo rich, fo arrogant, having had a hand
in fome publick employments, they fcorn
their kindred and country, forget their
birth and that neighbourhood which
brought them to this height of honour
:
and although like poor fneaks they came
to London in leather-breeches, and in
1642 were but vulgar fellows; yet now
coach it with four or two horfes, are
impudent, becaufe in authority: yet to
require fome of thefe, to write true Eng-
lifh, or fpeak fenfe, were to command a
270 On the Life and Death
fât from a dead man : but fuch as thele
muft know, if they have good eftates as
that they have, we of the commonalty
muft have an account of our treafure.
< And this {hall laft feven yeares, loe
c
ravening and fliedding of bloud.'
If we confider that our wars began in
Anno 1642, we fliall then find that our
diftempers and wars have continued feven
whole years, within our own kingdom ;
for one copy hath it,
Et feptennio durabit guerra intra.
The war fliall endure feven years within
the bowels of the kingdoms : and whereas
he mentions ravening, I conceive where
the foldier is quartered, that action of
ravening cannot be avoided. England
hath felt free quarter, both of her ov/n
countrymen, and of the Scots and Scotifh
army, who were the trueft harpies that
ever lived, ftealing and purloining where-
ever they came, even unto a difh-clout.
You fliall have one example of two Scots
in Lancafliire 1648, quartered there in
a poor houfe, where they got a kettle of
brafs, being all their poor landlord had,
and having it on the fire with oatmeal
boiling in ale or milk 3 an alarum comes,
of King CHARLES I. 2jt
and one of their own countrymen pafles
by and invites thefe two foldiers to run
away, for all was loft. But fee their
villany, and prefent reward of thefe two
fools : away they trudge, but carry the
kettle and porridge on a ftaff betwixt
them, their landlord in vain crying out
for his kettle. But it pleafed God an ho-
neft trooper of ours, making hafte to pur-
fue the knaves, flew both thefe gluttons,
and fo returned the kettle to the right
owner,
' And ovens ftiall be made like kirkes or
c
churches/
If it were not publickly done in many
places of this kingdom before 1646, viz.
that churches were many times as beaftly
as ovens: yet in 1648, and 1649, Paul's
church was made a horfe-guard, and fo
continued until of late.
After, ' Then fhall come through the
* fouth with the fun, on horfe of tree,
â¬
the chicken of the eagle fayling into
* Brittaine, and arriving anone to the Houfe
* of the eagle, hee (hall fliew fellowfhip to
* them hearts/
Here the copies vary exceedingly, one
faying only,
Deinde
272 On the Life and Death
Deinde Pullus Aquilce veniet fuper ligneos
equos anno & fenio & erit guerra in Brit-
tania.
Viz. After the chicken of the eagle
fhall come upon wooden horfes within a
year and a half, and there fhall be war
in Britain.
Another copy hath it thus :
Deinde ab aufiro veniet cum fole fuper
ligneos Equos \ & Junto fpumantem inunda-
tionem maris, pullus aquilce navigans in
Britanniam, & applicans Jlatim tunc alta?n
'
domum aquilceJittens & cito aHamftiet, viz.
Afterwards the chicken of the Eagle
fhall come with the Sun upon wooden
Horfes, &c.
Verily, in a former treatife of ours, we
were not much eftranged from verity : yet
our modefty was fuch, and our refpeft to
his Majefty's perfon, we were in many
thing? filent. But upon further confi-
deration, this chicken of the eagle will
prove one of his Majefty's children. And
we remember, that the prefent Scots King
did about July 1648, upon the South or
South-Eaft coaft of England, come in
perfon unto the revolted fhips : he landed,
or w as viftualled at Yarmouth, and then
failed towards Kent, but without fuccefs
:
He alfo after that attempted Yarmouth,
of King CHARLES I. 273
but that attempt proved fuccefflefs. But
whereas, the prophecy mentions, â¢ He
* fhould fhew (fellowfhip unto them

copy that I have feen : however, at that
time of the Prince's being at fea, here
was no treaty or overture either offered by
him unto the Parliament, or by them
unto him ; only the reft of the fhips,
.which revolted not, were feveral ways
dealt with to deliver them up unto him.
If by the eagle be intended King Charles
lately dead, as doubtlefs he was, the
chicken of the eagle muft of confequence
then be one of his children, and the pre-
fent King of Scotland ; and then the
words may have this fenfe : That the
Prince at that time fliould be defirous of
getting fome footing or landing-place in
Kent (called here the High Houfe of the
Eagle) in regard Dover-Caftle ftandeth in
Kent on a rock : but failing there, he
made his journey to Yarmouth, and fb
was defirous to procure that town : but
herein he alfo was deceived* It is evi-
dent that the late King was the Eagle;
for he did nothing but fly or ride up and
down, during fome years, before his
reftraint s and it muft of neceffity then

This fhews a continuance of the wars,
either abroad or at home for fome certain
time, or feveral years. And we know in
1646, that moft excellent man the Lord
Fairfax had even ended our wars ; but lo,
in 1648, feveral revolts and rebellions ap-
peared againft the Parliament befides the
Scotifh treacherous invafion; all which ma-
nifeft a continuance as it were of the wars

fhould either perfonally land himfeif, or

there would be no faith given to words*
Or any peace come from treaties : and we
well know with what difficulty the laft
treaty with his Majefty was obtained*
The Parliament had juft caufe to fear no
good would come from thence. The White
King, who ever loved to fifh in troubled
Waters, gave fuch ambiguous anfwers un-
to the Parliaments' propofitions, as figni-
fied nothing. Whereupon, confidering the
great engagement which lay upon them,
they at laft refolvfed,
Immedicabile vulnus etife reddendum* And
fo it was.
For verification of the latter part
:
Sed qui/que curabit quomodoy &c.
That every mail, who under the Par-
liament hath pilled, poled, or cheated
the people ; or any Parliament-man,
who hath by the ruin of the common-
wealth inriched himfelf, will be careful to
preferve his ill gotten goods, I do as verily
believe, as I do that there is a GOD in
Heaven.

It is in the Latin

At what time His Majefty went from
Hampton-Court, he went feeble, viz.
accompanied with no more than two or
three (a feeble company for a King) ; and
he then went to the Ifle of Wight, and
there furrendred himfelf to one Ham-
mond, governour of Carifbrough-Caftle
in the Ifle of Wight. That caftle ftands
near or upon the water. From this time
of his ifurrendring himfelf unto Ham-
mond, he was beclipped or ftraitly looked
unto by the foldiers. This is that Ham-
mond, as the King himfelf acknowledged
at Windfor, unto Ad. A. who furnilhed
him with that fmutty fheet Elenfticus
;
which accufed me of connivance with one
How of Gloucefterfhire, about Arabella
Scroop, one of the natural daughters of
the Earl of Sunderland. I challenge the
whole world, and both How and his
wife, and Hammond, to declare publickly,
if I had the leaft engagement, or did give
the leaft advertifement of any meeting of
theirs in the Spring-garden, or had any
connivance or plot in their defign : all
that
of King CHARLES I. 277
that ever I did, was a refolution of two
or three horary queftions, which pro-
miied the enjoyment of the woman. Not
having met with a fit opportunity of the
prefs, fince that flander caft upon me,
I took liberty herein to repeat this mat-
ter; giving that cavalier my moft hearty
thanks, that in publick took the pains to
vindicate my reputation: and although
I never had the happinefs, fince that his
vindication of me, to fee him ; yet let my
acknowledgment of that his courtefy be
accepted from him. Indeed, that oracle
of the law, whilft he lived, Sir Robert
Holborne, Knight, and my fingular friend,
both acquainted me of the man, and his
great labour to fift out the matter wholly,
ere committed to the prefs. The Lord
guide me in my ways, for I ferioufly pro-
teft unto pofterity, I never received fuch
injurious afperfions or calumnies, from
thofe who in reafon had caufe to be my
enemies, viz. the Royalifts, as from many
of our own party, or fuch as will or
would be called Roundheads. Had not
the virtue and honour of one not to be
paralleled member of Parliament, been
ever my fupport and defender, I had buried
my conceptions in filence, and fmothered
my endeavours in deep obfcurity. For

We may juftly wonder, how exactly
this was fulfilled in the death of King
Charles, or the White King, The truth
of it was thus : that fome few nights be-
fore his death, he was brought to White-
hall, the regal feat of his progenitors :
againft the day of his death a fcafFold was
framed over againft the new Banqueting-
Houle, built by King James : and when
the King went unto execution, a way or
paffage was made out at one of the
weft windows for him, to pafs out unto
the fcafFold, where his head was cut off.
So that very pertinently it was prqphe-
fied, he fhould fall into a, churchyard over
a hall.

ELIAS ASHMOLE, Efq.
IELIAS ASHMOLE, was the fon and
only child of Simon Afhmole of Litch-
field, fadler, eldeft fon unto Mr.
Thomas Afhmole of the faid city, fadler,
twice chief bailiff of that corporation ;
and of Anne, one of the daughters of
Anthony Bowyer of the city of Coventry,
draper, and Bridget his wife, only daugh-
ter to Mr Fitch of Aufley in the
county of Warwick, gentleman*
I was born the 23d. of May 16 17,
(and as my dear and good mother hath
often told me) near half an hour after 3
o'clock in the morning.
When I rectified my nativity, An. 1647.
I found it to be 3 hours 25 minutes 49
feconds A. M. the quarter cP of u af-
ceading. But upon Mr. Lilly's rectifica-
tion
283 The LIFE of
tion thereof, Anno 1667, he makes thd
quarter 36 afcending. I was baptized, the
the 2d of June following, at St. Mary's
church in Litchfield. My godfathers were
Mr. Chriftopher Baxter, one of the
proctors of the Bifhop's Court, and
Mr Offey, facrift of the cathe-
dral church.
Before I was carried to church, it was
agreed my name fhauld be Thomas (as
was my grandfather). But, when the
minifter bad name the child, my god-
father Offey anfwered Elias, at which his
partners wondered -
y and being (at their
return home) afked, why lie fo called me,
he could render no account, but that it
came fuddenly into his mind, by a more
than ordinary impulfe of fpirit. My god-
mother's name was Mrs. Bridges.
When I was about a year old, and fet
by the fire, I fell into it, and burned the
right fide of my forehead, it refting upon
the iron bar of the grate (of which a fear
always remained) but my good mother
being near, prefently took me up, and
applied fomething for my cure.
I had the fmall-pox (yet but few) as
alfo the fwine-pox and the meafles, when
I was young ; but know not the certain
time of either.
Being about 8 or 10 years old (but
the year I cannot remember) my mother
and
ELIAS ASHMOLE, Es^ 289
and I were invited to my Coufin Black-
burn's in Long Parifh ; at that time they
were building of a barn, and I getting up
by ladders to the top thereof, fell down ;
in which fall the infide of my right knee
ftruck againft the edge of a great beam,
which thereby received a deep triangular
gafh, of which I lay a long time before it
was cured.
James Pagit, Efq; fome time Puifne
Baron of the Exchequer, married to his
fecond wife, Bridget, one of my mother's
fifters, and widow to Moyre, a
confeftioner in London. He had a fifter,
who firft was married to Dr. Mafters
Chancellor of Litchfield ; and after, to
Dr. Twifden his fucceflbr in the faid
Chancellorship.
Thomas Pagit his fecond fon (the chief
inftrument of my future preferments,
which I acknowledge with all gratitude
to his memory) being much beloved of
his aunt Twifden, came often to Litch-
field, when he was young; whofe ftay
there, as it occafioned an acquaintance
with my mother (fifter to his mother-in-
law) fo it begat in him an affe&ion to-
wards me; infomuch, as having given
fome good charafter of me to his father,
he became inclined to have me fent up to
London : And becaufe he and his fons
were greatly affe&ed to mufick, and very

grounded therein, I became a chorifter
in the cathedral church, where I remained
till the laid Baron fent for me up to his
houfe.
Mr. Meftenger, and after him Mr. Toby
Henchman taught me Latin.
Mr. Henry Hinde, organift of the ca-
thedral, who died the 6th of Auguft, 1641,
taught me the virginets and organ.
1633. The 2d of July I began my jour-
ney from Litchfield : my father and mo-
ther brought me onward to the far end of
Baffet's heath.
The 5th of July, about 11 o'clock be-
fore noon, I entred London.
16 July, the before-mentioned Mrs.
Twifden died of the iliaca pqjjio, and was
buried the 1 8th following, in Litchfield
cathedral, in a chapel on the right hand
of the Lord Baffet's tomb ; where was a
monument for Dr. Matters and herfclf,
but broken down by the foldiers in the
Parliament war.
4 October, Mr. John Perfon, a phyfician
in Coventry (who had my mother's eldeft
fitter) was buried.
1634. My father died about eleven
o'clock before noon.

22. Mr. Simon Martin's letter, which
gave me notice of his death, bears date,
the 2 2d of June.
My father was born upon a Whitfunday
in the morning.
He was bred up by his father to his
trade ;
yet when he came to man's eftate,
followed it but little : He more affected
war, than his profeffion, and fpent many
of his years abroad, which drew on him
a courfe of expences and ill-hufbandry.
His firffc voyage was into Ireland, with
Robert Earl of Eftex, Anno 159 .. . Two
other voyages he afterwards made, with
his fon, Robert Earl of Effex into the
Palatinate, from whom he received good
refpeft. He was an honeft fair condi-
tioned man, and kind to others ; yet
through ill hufbandry, became a great
enemy to himfelf and poor family.
1635. In this year I was taught on the

For the truly honoured Elias Afhmole,
Efq. at his chamber in the Middle
Temple, over Serjeant Maynard's cham-
ber. In his abfence, to be left with
the Butler or Porter of the Middle
Temple, London.
Honoured Sir,
day of this inftant January (a day
ever to be rubrical amongft our city re-
mem-
O F
Thurfday, being the 17th
APPENDIX. 383
membrances) we received your Tina Ar-
gentea, your munificent filver bowl,
cloathed, in its delivery, with all thofe
rich circumftances of advantage, that could
poffibly either enable the gift to befpeak
the goodnefs and prudence of the giver,
or invite the faireft acceptation in the
receiver. For if we confider the perfon
from whom, it is the gift of an Elias,
a herald, not only proclaiming, but ac-
tually contributing good things to our
city ; and that by the hands of a Zacha-
rias, a faithful mefTenger, who with the
gift, did emphatically communicate the
fenfe and good affeftion of the giver.
And if we confider the time it was pre-
fented, it was the day of our Epiphany
feffioris of the peace for this city, where
our Bailiffs, High-Steward, Sheriff, Grand
Jury, and the reft of the body politick of
this ancient and loyal corporation, toge-
ther with other perfons of quality both
of the clergy and laity were convened to-
gether, and fo became prefent at this great
offering : As if fome propitious ftar ari-
fing in the Eaft, had (at this time) gone
before our Magus, fleering its courfe to
this our city of Litchfield (the Sarepta of
our Elias) and flood over the new-erected
pyramids of our cathedral (where as yet a
ftar appears) darting its benign influence
upon this poor and loyal city, inviting the
Magi
384 A P P E N D I X/
Magi from afar> to offer fome tribute to
it : A city that hath nothing to glory in,
but its ancient and modern loyalty to God
and Caefar, evidenced by her ancient
bearing in the city efcutheon (three Knights
martyred) as ancient as the days of
Dioclefian, and her name fignifying a
field of blood then fpilt ; to which may
be well added her modern and unparalleled
loyalty to that bleffed faint (now in hea-
ven) King Charles the martyr ; univer-.
fally witneffed by thofe honourable marks,
eraces, and wounds of loyalty, fhe yet
bears upon her perfons, temples, ftreets,
and walls ; (trophies of honour) Effici-
ently blazing to the world the true heraldry
of her ancient arms : nor have you only
given us this great cratera (upon which'
you have wifely impreft our city arms),
to folace the beft of the city, after their
time of fuffering; but, like one of thofe
true Magi, that offered to Chrift in his
pooreft condition, you have, largely of-
fered to the repair of his. church, our
ruined cathedral, which, by the unwearied
labour, prudence, piety, and charity of
our good (a) Bifhop, a fecond Cedda, and
the charity of yourfelf, and others, hap-
pily depofited in his hands, is (almoft to

pioufly to engrofs and cover all our ne-
ceffities, under that warm and nourilhing
mantle of Elias, we have received inti-
mation of your promifes of greater good
intended this great city. Now, Sir, give
us leave to conclude (having been already
too tedious) by informing you that, ac-
cording to your defire, (upon the firft
receipt of your Poculum Charitatis, at
the fign of the George for England) we
filled it with catholick wine, and devoted
it a fober health to our moft gracious
King, which being of fo large a conti-
nent, paft the hands of thirty to pledge

nor did we forget yourfelf in the next
place, being our great Maecenas ; affur-
ing you that (God willing) we fhall take
courfe that this great Tina Argentea
fhall, with our city-mace, and other
publick enfigns of dignity and authority,
be carefully tranfmitted, by indenture,
from Bailiffs to Bailiffs, in a continual
fucceffion, fo long as this ancient and
loyal corporation through the favour of
Princes (which we hope, we fhall never
forfeit) fhall have a charter to give it
life and being. For which end your many
