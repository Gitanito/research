I tºſometimes taken it into my head to write a long preface to
this little book, but this year find it inconvenient and unneceſſary,
becauſe I have filled it with ſomething elſe; and have, for ten years
and upwards, without regard to the ſtile of my predeceſſors, taken
the reſolution to endeavour to ſtuff my book as Aft of good ſenſe, as
an egg's full of meat. This brings to my recolle&tion the ſingular
ſenſible ode I have heard in days of yore; - - -
- When Bibo thought fit, from the world to retreat,
As full of champaigne as an egg's full of meat; -
He wak’d in the boat, and to Charon he ſaid,
He would be row’d back, for he was not yet dead.
Trim the boat and fit quiet, ſtern Charon reply'd,
- You may have forgot, you were drunk when you dy’d.
My readers will cry out, bravo, Robin what, this fooliſh drunken
ſong is given as a ſpecimen of your returning regard to ſober ſenſe,
to fill your book as full of ſenſe as an egg is of meat. But hold, I ſay,
can it § ſuppoſed that theſe lines would have ſtood the teſt of ages, of
arrived at that high degree of celebrity and honour that they have, to
be vociferated from the red-hot lungs of the choice ſpirits, at all the
drunken clubs in the united kingdom Could this have happened, if
they had not been univerſally allowed to be ſuperlatively beautiful ?
Surely then none can better deſerve a place in this ſuperlative per
formance, which has alſo ſtood the teſt of ages. How many unſucceſs
ful imitators has it had, as you all know, vain, and in vain emulating
Poor Robin's Almanack, which is like the ſun-ſhine illuminating the
darkneſs of theworld, diſpelling the miſtsof ignoranceand error,warm
ing the heart, and charming the eyes of all beholders. Where ſhall its
fellow for all this be found? Like the wiſdom it attempts to teach, it is
ineſtimable. Yet for all this it cannot make fools wiſe, for none are ſo,
deaf asthoſe that will not hear, and to ſtrive toſow edification among
ſuch is like preaching to the wind. The truth of this every day amon
us, if poſſible, makes it more apparent. Here are different orders Ó
men among us, who make it their buſineſs, nay, whoſe livelihood
it is to teach others, yet will not thoſe others hear them; they pro
claim undeniable ū: around, yet will not others believe them;
things of the moſt momentous concernment they offer and promiſe
yet will not others truſt them. What then are thoſe others but ſº
A race of mortals wheſe progeny is never, while the world laſts,
likely to fail. Abounding in every rank and ſtation, in every nation
ungovernable, yet pretending to govern others, though moſt unable
to govern theniſelves. From this moſt numerous fraternity the fools,
I wiſh my kind readers to declare quite off. To do this, or give this
good advice, I am in duty bound. And though ſome may unwit
tingly belong to this numerous clan, I mean to ſtrive to alter them,
if poſſible. And becauſe chriſtianity might fright fools, I have, in
the ſecond part of this my delectable performance, given them, in a
new verſified dreſs, Heathen Philoſophy, as ſummed up in the very
edifying Tablet of CEBEs, which ſtood the teſt, and has eſcaped the
wreck, of ſo many ages and nations. * -- a

• THE TABLET of cedes;
a picrureof HUMAN LIFE.
~ : from rat crºss. - -
As we in Saturn's Temple walking were,
Among the Curioſities plac'd there; . .
A kind of ſacred Tablet we all ſaw, .
... Before a chapel, with a kind of awe.”
Figures peculiar and foreign too,
Depicted on it, we admiring view.
We doubted not it had ſome meaning fine,
But what the ſubjećts were could not divine.
The pićture look'd like neither camp nor town,
But an incloſure, and within its own
Peculiar bound, two others pićtur'd were,
And theſe a greater and a leſs appear.
The whole Park's portal had an open door,
And many people ſtanding it before.
Within the fence, we many females ſcan,
And ſtanding in the porch an aged man,
If at appearance we to gueſs might venture,
Directing and commanding thoſe who enter.
Whilſt we with one another were debating,
What all this mean could, which I here am ſtatin
. Near us a man, advanc'd in years, addreſs'd
Us thereupon, and thus himſelf expreſs'd :
As you are ſtrangers, it no wonder is,
You're at a loſs to know what's meant by this.
To ſeveral people, natives of this town,
The true intent and meaning is unknown.
Indeed it was no native placid it here, ,
But a learn’d ſtranger, now gone many a year.
He the wiſe tenets of Pythagoras taught,
And juſt and prudent, § in deed and thought ;
This lofty temple he both elevated. -
To Saturn, and this Tablet dedicated. *
Have you, ſir, ſeen the very perſon, who
This conſecrated, which us puzzles ſo *- :
Yes, well I knew him, and him much admir’d,
Tho' rather young, his company deſir'd ;
* l 803.

An 1
No. 141. Poor Robin. 35
So full of wiſdom was his converſation: ... ;
I’ve often heard him, not I hope in vain,
The ſubject of this Tablet here explain. .
As we the meaning too much wiſh to know,
Pray, ſir, explain it to us ere we go. >
This, he replies, with pleaſure I would do, , .
But that it dangerous may be to you. .
We aſk, ſurpriz'd, what danger can there be .
'Tis this, without delay, thus anſwers he.
If you the leſſon taught here well obſerve,"
And never from the wiſe inſtruction ſwerve ;
As wiſe and happy you will merit praiſe,
If not, you wretched will be all your days.

He then was ſavid, if not, ſhe ſuck'd his blood. . .
So ignorance in life as fatal is, " . . * . "
As if the monſter's meaning you ſhould miſs.
All, good, bad, and indifferent in life, . .
Here pićtur'd is before you, and your ſtrife
Muſt be to underſtand, the good to chuſe,
And all that’s bad as carefully refuſe;
Or you will be deſtroy'd without all cure, , ,
And ruin’d by degrees, tho' ſlow, yet ſure; ,
By ling’ring tortures given up to death,
Certain as if a monſter ſtopp'd your breath.
But if you rightly underſtand what's here,
All ignorance muſt forthwith diſappear: -
You're ſav’d, and found deſerving of all praiſe,
And happy ſpend the remnant of your days.
To all I ſay, attend then as you ought,
It well, believe me, merits all your thought.

You ſee a tribe of women looſe appear, . . .
In great variety of dreſs and air. . . . .
Thoſe the Opinions are, Déſires and Pleaſures,
Who, ...enter, call them treaſures; . .
Fly to them,"and embrace them all the way, , .
And with great earneſtneſs lead them aſtray:
Who to perdition run in folly's race,
Tho' ſome of them they too in ſafety place. . .
Why drank they of that liquor coming in,
Since here the road to ruin muſt begin?"
You ſay. Becauſe theſe tell all they embrace,
They'll lead them to the beſt and happieſt#:
Whilſt blinded by large draughts from Falſehood’s cup,
Greedy, as if they meant to drink all up; . -
In life, cannot diſtinguiſh the right way,
But wand'ring here and there, all from it ſtray;
And they who have been in ſome time, obſerve,
Do juſt the ſame, and from the right way ſwerve:
Yes, we reply. But who's that woman ſhown,
Here blind and mad, ſtanding on a round ſtone?
'Tis Fortune, he rejoins, as ſtrange as true,
Nor only blind and mad, ſhe's ſtone-deaf too.
Her buſineſs is to fly about and ſnatch,
From any one, whatever ſhe can catch,
And give it to another, then from him
To take it, and a third ſerve ſo, for whim.
No certainty of meaning can appear, -
As repreſented by her figure here.
Cn a round ſtone unſtable moſt ſhe ſtands,
To ſhew uncertain gifts come from her hands;
And that her votaries muſt expect withal,
To meet ſome great miſchance, or fatal fall,

Why thus ſhould ſome thus vary from the reſt,
What want they of her He replies, Theſe all
The tribe of Inconſiderates we call, , , , ,,
And what they want of her, are all thoſe things,
She, without rule or reaſon, round her flings. .
Such as receiv'd have ſomething at her hand,
Here ſmiling and rejoicing you ſee ſtand,
The title of Good Fortune give her; known
Too by their paſſions, who what ſhe had thrown
Had gather’d, but ſhe from them again took ;
Bad Fortune theſe her call, with a ſad look.
Wealth, glory, rank, birth, dignity, a crown,
The gifts are ſhe thus ſcatters up and down.
All theſe mankind in general eſteem * . .
As good, and matter of rejoicing deem.
Rightly and wiſely whether thus they do,
I, in the ſequel, more at large may ſhew.
On with our pićture let us here proceed.
After this portal is thus paſt indeed,
Another cloſe upon an higher ground,
And ſeveral gaudy ladies there are found.
Intemperance and Luxury ſtand there,
And Avarice with Flattery appear.
The Inconſiderates theſe wait for, who
Have Fortune's gifts receiv'd before; and lo,
How with the greateſt fondneſs they embrace,
Forthwith attach themſelves with pleaſing grace;
Promiſe they every delight ſhall ſhare -
In life, quite free from trouble, pain, and care.
Now to Voluptuouſneſs, who carry'd is
Away by them, at firſt not much amiſs,
Will find or think their company or faſhions,
While fondling thus and tickling all his paſſions.
But ſoon, alas ! the caſe is alter’d quite,
When he recovers once his ſenſes right,
As not he them, but that they him enjoy,
They prey upon him, and will him deſtroy,
Inſult and force him to become their ſlave,
After he waſted has all Fortune gave;
Him yield to actions ſcandalous will make,
And villanies of all ſorts, for their ſake,

To cheat, rob, ſwear, and lie, he hence is driven,
And then to puniſhment he up is given.
For you may ſee beyond thoſe women there, w
A narrow cavern, and ſmall door appear:
Some miſerable females too within,
In nothing clad but filthy rags are ſeen;
This is the cave of Puniſhment, who ſtands
Here, holding up her ſcourges in her hands;
And Sorrow bent near double too is near,
Anguiſh of mind ſits tearing her own hair.
Repining's that bare figure of a man,
Deſpair, his ſiſter, that lean woman wan.

To be tormented by them while they pleaſe;

To find out Science, either falſe or true. , , , , . "
Here, into branches two, divides the way,
And along either of them walk he may. -
The one leads up dire&t to Science true, *
The other, bent to Science falſe, you view.
And if the firſt of them he wiſely chuſe,
This makes him happy, and his ſoul renews,
But if he take the other of theſe ways,
Falſe Science may perplex him all his days.
Goodneſs! we cry, new danger then is here! -
Pray tell us which falſe Science is, and where *
He ſays, the ſecond Park here you may view,
And juſt without it, ſee a woman too
Stand by the entrance, elegantly dreſt,
More ſtriking in appearance than the reſt.

She in reality falſe Science is. -
Thoſe ſav'd out of the houſe of Miſery there,
In paſſing to true Science, oft call here.

And who thoſe buſy crew of women round,
So like Intemperance and all her race, -
We aſk, as thoſe you in the firſt Park place R
They are the very fame, he ſays, who here
Come too, but not ſo readily as there.
The Opinions alſo to this Park belong,
And all thoſe whom Deceit at firſt led wrong:
With Ignorance and Folly by their fide,
And with them muſt continure and abide,
Till they ſhall quit falſe Science for the true,
And drink her purifying liquor too :
The evil dregs that in them ſtill remain
To purge away, and waſh out every ſtain :
Which nothing elſe can do. Falſe Science never
This can remove, but it will laſt for ever.
But to proceed. You ſee that place on high,
It, as if uninhahited, you ſpy.
A little opening between the rocks,
With a faint track is ſeen, and not in flocks; _*
The people who walk there ſeem very few,
The path ſo rough and hard is to purſue.
A high cliff alſo on the hill is ſeen,
With two ſteep precipices plac'd between;
As frightful as you doubtleſs think this may,
This to true Science is the only way:
Above the cliff you ſee a riſing rock
With precipices round, a fearful ſtock;
Upon the rock two women; notice take,
What firmneſs and what beauty in their make
Their hands ſo earneſtly you fee out ſtretch,
As if they ſomething had they wiſh'd to reach.
Theſe are two fifters, Temperance the one,
The other Perſeverance, both well known.
The reaſon they ſo ſtretch their arm is this,
Leſt thoſe who're got thus far their end ſhould miſs.
Encourage them, bidding them never fear,
For that the end of all their ſuff'ring's near.
One noble effort if they make will more,
The road's all ſmooth and pleaſant them before.
And as the rock is ſteep and trackleſs known,
To help them up, to meet them they come down.
To reſt a little while they then deſire them,
So with new ſtrength and courage they inſpire them.

Here is the habitation of the bleſt, ... . . . *

In what a charming place they have to dwell -

How beautiful and ſteady in her look . . * ,
Of middle age, or paſt it, ſhe ſeems took. . . .
Dreſs'd in a plain long robe, ſhe takes her ſtations.
Without all ornaments or affectation. w
She ſtands not on a round but a ſquare ſtone,
By which her great ſtability is flown.
Two other ladies, plac'd on either hand, . . . "
Are her two daughters, we may underſtand. . .

But if he will not take his med'cines, he
By the diſtemper then deſtroy’d muſt be.

She all the noxious things that in him are, .
Drives out of him, by drinking of her cup,

As from the cup of fell Deceit he had
Pride, Luſt, and Anger, every thing that's bad ;

If wiſely you will follow in the way . . . . .
Which I have ſhewn you, and it is no leſs
Than that, which to their mother Happineſs
Will lead you. That high edifice ſee you, , , ,
Higher than all the Parks and buildings too ! . . . . .

O’ertopping all the edifices round. . .
That compos'd Lady. Beautiful, and ſo
On a throne ſitting in the portico;
A chaplet of ſweet flow’rs her head ſurrounds,
And ſhe is Happineſs, that knows no bounds.
Aſſiſted ſhe by all, the Virtues here,
With her own influences crowns him there,
In the ſame manner as they crowns have gain'd,
Who have the greateſt conqueſts now obtain'd.
The greateſt victories he’s won indeed, 4.
From monſters terrible himſelf has freed,
Who once tormented him, enſlav’d, devour’d,
Theſe driving quite away, has overpower'd;
Become is maſter of himſelf, nay more, y
Makes thoſe obey, whom he obey'd before. -
Error and Ignorance are what I mean,
Greater than theſe, no monſters e'er were ſeen.
His ſorrows and repinings, covetings,
Intemperance, and all that evil brings, -
Theſe he has quite ſubdu'd, is from them free,
Tho' they his tyrant maſters us’d to be.
For ſuch exploits he’s worthy, as you ſaid,
To wear a glorious crown upon his head:
Whoſe influence, when once he has it on,
Is, that he feels the bliſs he now has won,
And
Poor Robin. ... 1806.
And that he thus is eaſy made will find,
Poſſeſſing mild tranquillity of mind. ---
After he's crown'd then, as you wiſh to know
What he will do, and whither he will go
The Virtues take, and lead him to the phace "
Which firſt he left, and bid him mark the caſe
of thoſe, who there had all the while remain'd,
That pain and trouble only they'd obtain'd.
Shipwreck'd in life, about in it they toil,
Or led along as captives for a ſpoil;
Some by Intemperance, others by Pride,
By Avarice, and every Vice beſide.
Much to eſcape they ſtrive, but all in vain,
The Vices load all with a heavy chain.
To find a place of reſt, vain is their ſtrife,
One ineffectual ſtruggle is their life.
All this woe riſes from their firſt neglect
Of what the Genius rightly would direét.
This, we reply, appears to be the caſe;
But why the Virtues back to the ſame place
Should take the perſon, where he firſt was found,
And after he'd by Happineſs been crown'd?
To this, he ſays, he'd no idea juſt
Before, he gueſs'd alone, and took on truſt.
The draught of Ignorance and Error, he
Drank #. him dazzl’d ſo he could not ſee.
But bad he took for good, and good for bad,
As wretchedneſs in common there all had.
But now what really good is he can know,
Happy himſelf, he ſee can others woe.
Free, ſafe as thoſe in the Corycian cave,
Where the nine Muſes their ſnug dwelling have.
Secure and undiſturb’d he lives in bliſs,
And by all others now receiv'd he is,
With as much pleaſure, as a good phyſician
Is by his patients, when in heal’d condition.
The female monſters he no longer dreads,
They either ſkulk away, or hide their heads.
From Grief, from Anguiſh, and Intemperance frees
From Avarice fafe and Poverty is he.
He's maſter and ſuperior to all, -
That once him held in fuch a ſtate of thral.

Seen, as it were, deſcending in a flock -

A crew of women follow them and flout them.

To Science true. . And thoſe who crowns have not,
And ſeen returning in condition ſad, -
Are ſuch as when they ſafe arrival had
At the dread precipice where Patience ſtands,

Thoſe who it wiſh, this too's a uſeful thing: , ,
They are like tranſport ſhips, returning ſtreight
For other, when déliver'd is one freight; , , , ,
we thank you, fir, who have explain’d ſo well.
The figures in the picture ; but to tell, -
If not too troubleſome you think us will,
One more enquiry we to make have ſtill.
What the direétions moſt important are
which the directing Genius gives here,
Upon their entring the firſt portal, as
It influence may much what comes to paſs
The Genius bids them of good courage be,
On entºring into life, and ſo let me... -
Bid you be of good courage, whilſt you hear,
I'll do my beſt to every thing make clear.
The woman ſtanding on the round ſtone muſta
The Genius ſays, be one you cannot truſt;
Nor look upon her gifts as firm, fecure,
Northink them property that will endure.
Her from reſuming them none hinder can,
And giving them to any other man,
And thus ſhe is extremely apt to ačt, -
*Tis Fortune's proper buſineſs, in fact.
He orders them, to think of ſmall account
Her preſents, whatſoever their amount.
Nor over-much rejoice when ſhe will make them,
Nor be dejećted if away ſhe take them.
Yet of her to think neither well nor ill; .
For without thought are all her doings ſtill. -
On this account the Genius commands . -
Nothing to over-rate, fallen from her hands.
Nor like thoſe firmple bankers be, who when
Receiving, upon truſt, ſome caſh, are then
So pleas'd with it, as if it were their own;
And when they’re call’d upon to pay it down
Again, uneaſy grow, and i. it think
To part again with the beloved chink;
Forgetting it was put into their hands
To ſatisfy the owner's juſt demands.
he Genius thus gives orders to all men,
To look upon the gifts of Fortune then.
And be aware, whenever ſo inclin'd, -
She may recal them, which they muſt not mind,

Qf what is really good the Knowledge true, , , ,

And when they come where thoſe two women ſit,
Voluptuouſneſs and Intemperance, , , , , , ,

I now have the whole Parable explain'd,
That in this curious Tablet is contain'd. . . . . .
So now I ready am to take the taſk
of anſwering any queſtion you may aſk.
To you our many thanks are very ſmall ., r
Reward, pray ſay why to the Park at all - -
Of Science falſe, the Genius men ſends • *

The literature,which, Plato ſays, to youth,
Is like a bridle guiding them to Truth.

As to what's bad and good, are hurt and griev'd.
Continue funk in Vices all, we ſee, -
Tho' maſters of all literature they be. - 2
Knowing all Science, yet a man may ſtill -
A drunkard be, or glutton, if he will.
He may become a mifer, and unjuſt,
Or ſo improvident none will him truſt.
we inſtances of this ſee every day; . . .
Then where’s the º: great of learning, pray :
Of all this infelicity, we ſee, -
This is the cauſe. They haſtily agree, -
When in the ſecond Park, to place their home
With Science falſe, and to the true ne'er come.
What can be got by that Many are found, - -
Who from Intermperance and the Vices round,
Direétly from the firſt Incloſure, to -
That of true Science, on are ſeen to go;
And that without once ſtopping on the road,
Where thus the learned . up their abode.
How then can it be ſaid that learned men -
Have over others the advantage then? * -
As in activity they leſs abound, - -
And are leſs aiming at inſtruction found 7
For in the ſecond Park, when all is done,
Of all their faults to mention only one.
To know, what they know not, they all profeſs,
So in their ignorance they acquieſce. -
To ſeek true Science they no motive find,
And then another thing them helps to blind.
The Opinions coming from the firſt Park here,
Theſe with them freely to converſe appear.
As much ſo as before, ſo that they may
Eſteem'd be in no better ſtate, I ſay;
Unleſs Repentance too ſhould interfere,
And them convince true Science is not there.
But what they’ve been embracing all this while,
Is her falſe ſemblance, apt ſo to beguile,
That has deceiv'd them. ...And while in this mind,
Small is the hope they will Repentance find.
So to cloſe all, my friends, I you intreat,
Think over in your minds all I thus ſtate;
Repeatedly it ponder, and well weigh,
And let it guide your practice every day.

From this no difficulties let affright; ' " '
Walk in the ways of Virtue, and account
All other things to be of ſmall amount:
Then will this leſſon, thus ſet in diſguiſe,
Render you eaſy, happy, good, and wiſe... "
But, fir, the gifts that Fortune about flings,
'Tis hard to think of as indifferent things,
Are not life, health, with riches, glory, ſons,
- And ſuch like, reckon'd to be boons :
And evils the contrary Admirable,
And hardly to believe you're ſpeech we're able.
In anſwer to all this, he ſays, I too ... **
In turn, have a few queſtions to aſk you. ºr
is life itſelf a good to him that will,
By all his ačtions, prove that he lives ill
Or had you rather live ill whilſt you’d breath,
Or honeſtly and bravely ſuffer death
The latter I ſuppoſe now, ſay you will, -
Hn this caſe death can ſcarce be call’d an ill.
Both life and death then, rightly underſtood
Are as they’re us’d here either ill or good.
Thus life and death are either good or not,
Like, in compariſon, an iron hot ;
- To thoſe who're ſick ſalubrious it may turn,
While thoſe that ſound are, it will pain and burn.
And ſo it is of life, as well or ill
You ačt or uſe it, ſo it turns out ſtill.
And if we turn our thoughts to riches, then,
They are not always bleſſings found to men.
And hence it probably is underſtood,
That learning, and not riches, make men good.
When better, men the owners for them are,
Riches are good, but otherwiſe a ſnare.
And thoſe who know not rightly how to uſe them,
Will, in all probability, abuſe them. -
We ſee them magnify’d beyond all meaſure,
This even makes them ceaſe to be a treaſure.
- When impious men, thro’ them, all crimes commit,
… Thro' wilful ignorance of what’s good and fit.
Act wiſely then, do good with all your might,
And it ſhall be both treaſure and delight.

during all the ſeventecnth, and I am Poor Robin yet, and not about
to change my name to Rich haſtily. “I have poverty by preſcription,
for Rich Robin would ſurely found, very queerly. And as this is .
ele&tion time, no doubt the mob will cry, Poor, Robin for ever.
Courage, brother burgeſſes, who are poor as I am, I truſt you are
not haſtily going to loſe my fraternity, my poverty the better enables
me to be your repreſentative. Sedſatis, a word to the wiſe is enough.
And to make you wiſer I now inform you, º
That the Sun will be eclipſed on Monday, the 21ſt of February,
but it being at # min. paſt nine o'clock at night, at new moon, when
you can neither ee her nor it, except you ſail to the great South-Sea,
which is hardly worth your while, if you can go to bed and ſleep in
Old England. - -:
So ſtay a month longer, till Monday, the 21ſt of March, when at
20 min, paſt : in the afternoon, the Qaarter called Spring will begin :
the finging of birds will be in ſeaſon, and in April the voice of the
cuckow will be heard in our land, which ſome think a miſnomer,
ſome abuſe, but I delight to hear, becauſe of the good tidings ſhe
brings, that this is the ſeaſon of melody and love. -
On the 22d day of June, 2 min: paſt 11 in the morning, the Summer
Quarter begins, during which,that is, on the 17th day of Auguſt,
a ſecond Eclipſe of the Sun will happen, may more than that, will be
ſeen here to begin at 55 min, paſt 5 in the morning. Greateſt obſcu
ration at 41 min. 1-half paſt 6. Viſible conjunétign at 44 min. paſt 6.
The end at 30 min, 1-half paſt 7. So that it will be but a ſmall and
ſhort one. Digits 3°12', and at 167° from the Sun's vertex on the
left hand, the Moon makes her firſt impreſſion on the Sun's Diſk. .
Autumn Quarter this year begins on the 24th of September, very
early in the morning, but if you riſe ever ſo ſoon you cannot ſee the
Sun's ingreſs into the Jºãº ſign Libra, he being then below the
horizon. In reality, it is little more than an imaginary affair to ſee
the Sun enter an imaginary point. Now if you have any fruit gather
it in ; if you have not, buy while it is cheap, for it will certainly be
dearer, as well as the potatoes and other roots, before the froſts come
and ſpoil them. For ſhortly you muſt expečt the - - -
Winter Quarter, which will, as it did laſt, begin this year on the
22d day of December, and nine more ſhort cold days ºãº. this
revolving year to a concluſion. . . . - ,
