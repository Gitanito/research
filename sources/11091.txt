  		              		Experience Description   

    This happened to me in 1978.  
  
  I am sad to admit that I was born into a Catholic family, but my parents never totally believed or converted. My mom was pregnant with me as her second child. She was eight months pregnant,  riding a bicycle and had an accident. I was born almost on an ambulance bed in   1971.  At a very early age, I understood why I was not a very welcomed baby.  
  
  When I was three years old, I was a very talkative little girl and  had witnessed some events. I had the tendency to speak my mind and was very close to my dad.  I mentioned to him what I had seen. I was so innocent at the time, I didn't know why that had caused so much trouble. My life took a sad turn. I had to act normal while my dad was present, but I was being punished by my own mother. I was forced to keep silent. I thought this was what normal was, so I always tried to be happy and prayed to God that my mom would show  love to me.  
  
  In December 1978, my mother was upset with my dad for not arriving home soon enough. It was a very cold winter and we were poor. My mom wanted  me and my two brothers to go to sleep. She put the little Mexican grill, called a brasero, and placed it in the middle of the room.  Then she lit the charcoal.  She covered the bottom of the door with newspaper so no air could come in from outside. I felt like something hit my chest and got a bad feeling like she was about to do something terrible.  She was incredibly upset and acting irrational, so I asked her to stop what she was doing.  All she did was scream at me to obey her and go to sleep.  
  
She locked the door and the windows. The last thing I remember was trying sleeping on the bed next to my brother.  I was feeling so scared that my heart was beating so fast. I could feel the sound of my heart all over my body; in my head, my ears, and even my feet. I started to cry. I covered my mouth with my left hand and assumed a fetal position. I closed my eyes and recited prayers. I thought, 'Please God, don't let me die without having my first communion. I want to feel the sensation of receiving your body and your blood at least once.'  

The fire started and I remember a weird feeling rising in my throat. I opened my eyes and I saw a black cloud all over the room. I started coughing and my head was so heavy. I felt dizzy and that was the last thing I was aware of. The room had quickly filled with toxic smoke. We all suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning and lost consciousness.  

Then, I saw a beautiful light on top of my bed. I will describe it as a golden figure that was calmly radiating light. The figureIt extended its left arm and pulled at my hand, so I got up and surveyed the room. Smoke was everywhere.  My little brother was crying, and my mother and other brother were sleeping.  

I tried to run to the door, but my movements felt like they were in slow motion. I was following this beautiful beam of light. I reached the door and the golden figure passed through. I remember I tried to open the door, but it was locked. I was floating and wanted to come down to reach the door, but it was impossible.  

I then saw the beautiful beam of light outside on the patio. It was floating up and I moved his left hand so I could follow him. He was more beautiful outside. This was like the Jesus images I saw in the Bible. His face was shining and he was smiling.  His eyes were so deep. I felt that he could sent me lights of love. I wished to stay like that forever. It was the most amazing experience in my whole life! It was like he was taking me to heaven with him and I was happy to follow him.  

I then came back for a moment. I remembered my mom and my brothers, so I couldn't just leave. I ask him to please save them and he smiled. I flew through the door.  The two of us went up to the next floor. We were outside the door of my neighbor’s. She was a 60 year old lady who was very close to my family. I recall trying to scream her name, but I had fallen mute. I tried to pull the door knob and it was impossible. I then turned my face to the Lord and silently begged with my heart for God to save my mom and my brothers, even if it meant my death.  

What happened next was a miracle. I saw Jesus knocking on her door three times.  She came out of the house and asked who knocked.  She did not see anyone and was under the impression that this was a prank committed by the neighborhood kids, so she went back inside her house. I tried to ask her to come downstairs and save us. I saw the Lord Jesus closing his eyes, position His right hand in the air, and then place His left hand on the shining heart that was on the center of His chest. He then touched the door knob and it opened.  

In that moment, my neighbor turned around and started toward the door.  She then ran down the stairs that led into my house because she could smell the smoke from her house. She started to screaming so loudly that a few people woke up and came to help.  

I saw her knocking on our door and screaming my mother’s name so loudly, but there was no response.  She then tried to forced the door open, but it was so heavy that she couldn't open it alone. Then, her son came down and she asked him to break the glass window in the door. He took a piece of wood and broke it the window.  He was able to unlock the door from inside.  

They opened the door, grabbed two towels, and took the little burning brasero outside to the patio. I saw them reaching the bedroom and trying to carry out my little brother and my mom.  They took them outside, and I begged for them to hurry and bring my other brother. I saw them going to my bed, and  I was expecting to see my brother there, scared and wide awake. But, my heart froze over. I saw my brother and myself lying down on the bed unconscious. They had to carry my brother outside and then me.  

We were lying down on the floor.  My mother was already gaining consciousness while another woman was trying to give her water. My brothers and I were on the patio floor. People were performing CPR. Everything felt like a movie. Once I regained a little consciousness, I turned onto my right shoulder to thank the Lord Jesus, but He was gone.  

The last thing I remember was feeling a very strange force inside my body. My soul was filling into my body again, so I opened my eyes.  I was trying to get up despite the coughing and dizziness. I had a massive headache, sore eyes, and a sore throat.  I knew that this wasn't a dream and that everything was real.  I tried to get up to look everything around me, so I could observe every detail.  

Everybody was regaining consciousness. My brothers were crying. My neighbor asked my mom why she did such a crazy thing by lighting the basero with no air in the room.  My mom replied with nonsense. I tried to say something but my mom's eyes were already staring at me and I felt afraid to say anything.  

A man who was there had some kind of nursing knowledge and said that we needed to cleanse all the toxic smoke and the carbon monoxide from our bodies.  We were poisoned by it, and it was very dangerous.  They made us drink milk, and then a man lifted each one of us children and spun us in a little circle in order to force us to vomit. My mom did not want to take us to an emergency room or any clinic, so I know that it was a miracle that Lord Jesus saved us. My neighber never know who was knocking at her door.   

Then, I saw a little light in the corner.  It looked like golden halos. I walked towards that light, still feeling dizzy. As I got closer, I clearly saw a beautiful angel with a bright sword in his right hand. He pointed down with his sword to the little grill that still was burning while saying penance three times.  

Then he told me to take the plastic bowl, fill it with water, put some black charcoal inside, and then drink. I did. After I drank the water, the angel told me to grab some burned ashes and make a cross on my forehead with them. He said that those were signs of penance and obedience. The water was the sign of purification, the ashes represent our Lord burning with his fire of justice and this was a symbol of the love and promise from the encounter with Jesus. I will remember forever that I was marked by Our Lord as His loving child.  

Afterwards, He told me that I was going to be fine, but different. He said that I would see things than others could not see, and that I must be humble and good in my heart. He told me to pray more for people who deeply needed prayers, especially for the innocent children that are killed in the womb. I could not totally comprehend it at the time, but as the years progress, I feel as though I finally understand what he meant.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes On the beginning I kept the secret, no one on my family even suspect anything but like I have experienced the dreams premonitions, hurt, pain, visions, telepathy phenomenon my mother and siblings were very aware that I was a very different girl, I was very insulate always, no to social, very often they left me alone at the house because I never enjoyed big parties I complained about the loud music all the time, so they were very upset with me until I growed up and was able to work at 16 yrs old so I can paid my own education, my dad was always a factory worker, we were not able to afford education, it was a big family of 7 and my parents didnt want me to go to school, but the blessed mother of God want me to do so, I started working and going to school until I graduate from Collage.  My relations-ship with my family and relatives was always very dry, they always though I was sick or anormal, but because I was working and giving them money to build a bigger house and helping them with most of the bill payments, they left me speak my mind sometime.  After years I work for an international company and move to USA so I never came back to live ovethere, I married my american husband and have 4 children.  A few times went to Mexico City to visit them or they came to USA to visit us.  On the Last years that I was more and more involved on the Pro Life Ministry, on completely dedicating my life to my apostolate, they decide to stop any kind of relationship with me, not before warning me to choose between my faith and believes or them.   I choose God so I continue working for his mission, even though I encountered so much hate, discrimination, hate, persecution, defamation, judgment, rejections I will continue fighting for defending life of the innocent children and to share the love of Christ of Lord and his blessing mother.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  Something like this will can't ever be forgotten, the experience continue because the Lord continue to appear and my dreams always have a lecture a psalm on the scripture, a teaching that can help me to reinforce my faith and my mission  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     Premonitions, telepathy, experience pain at the distance for others while I pray for them, even for people that were not to close to me, I experienced things like accidents and attacks that they experienced. I did have more and more encounters with Angels and the Blessing Mother of God and Saint Padre Pio. On my 3 yrs of life I experienced a intense pain while they put a shot on my left shoulder, I was bleeding so bad that the nurses, my mother and people at the clinic were scared, the blood cover all my clothes and the floor, it was inexplainable on that time, but after that experience they were so many to come and I learned why after my encounter with Jesus.    

Since that day, everything was different like the angel said. I was able to see him and two other angels. When I turned eight years-old, it was on Saint Michael Archangel, San Gabriel, and San Rafael Feast Day. I experienced a different encounter this time. I was woken up at six o'clock in the morning by the Angel Michael, and he said to follow him outside. I was wearing my blue nightgown.  Istepped barefoot into the street where there was a huge tree. He then got on his knees, bowed his forehead on his hands that were touching the floor. He asked me to do the same.   

He then started praying and asked me to repeat after him the Fatima prayer, 'Oh my Jesus forgive us our sins…'  

I was asked to get up and if was studying hard for my first communion.   

I eagerly told him that I was almost ready to received my first communion in December.  He said to me, 'Our Lord knows how important this is for you. You must be good. You must pray more, and even if you suffer, never be bad. Sacrifices must be done for others that need more prayers.'  

I smiled. He pointed to a rock at the bottom of the tree, and he told me to take the rock. Once I had done so, the rock became a silver medal with a beautiful angel on it that had the following inscription on the back: 'V+K.'  

The Angel was the Angel of Peace and he told me that the letters would make sense to me the next time that I stopped in front the door. Then he said, 'I will see you soon' and left.   

When I turned 9 years old, I experience a terrifying vision of Hell. I was totally awake and conscious.  I was in ecstasy because I was left alone at home, while my parents went out for a few hours.   while I was sleeping, it was around 4 o'clock in the afternoon when they left.  They locked the doors and turn off all the lights.  I was awakened by the same Angel around 7:30 at night only this time I had the most terrified experience.  He asked me to be brave. I felt myself falling down into a very dark and deep pit, like a volcano.  I was able to hear screaming and it was so hot. There were burning fire stones everywhere.  I was falling down so slowly that I felt that I was fighting back the gravity and trying to escape.  I almost got back to the top, but nothing helped.  This was so horribly vivid that the neighbors were able to hear my screaming.  The same neighbors who rescued me a few years earlier, were now trying to take me out of my house.  They broke the kitchen window and were able to rescued me.  I was on shock.  I couldn't move or talk.  I was almost frozen, cold like a stone.    

The Angel told me not to say a word, that I was brave, and he feel sorry for me.  But, it was need it to be that way.    

A month later, the Angel appeared again.  It was a beautiful morning, very early right before sunrise.  He asked me to follow him to the Chapel.  Outside in the street, I then experienced the first of many apparitions.  Our blessed Mother Mary was sitting on a bench crying.  She was dressed all in white.  She seemed unconsolable.  I rushed to kneel next to her. I grab her legs and beg for her to stop crying.  'Please, please,' I said, 'I will die for you if you want but please don't cry anymore.'  I then kissed her feet, they hurt her and were bleeding.  I kissed them and my tears were cleaning her wounds.  She then started crying and held my arms.  She was intently looking me and asked if I know who she was.  I said, 'Yes, you are the Mother of God and I want you to be my Mamita too.'  

  I had written down this experience and waited 36 yrs in obedience to delivered the letter to Pope Francisco on August 17, 2016.  After all these years, I still receive messages and visions about everything that is happening in the world, like all the hurricanes, earthquakes, attacks, and persecutions.  It was everything that was said by our blessed Mother on 1979.  
    

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          After that experienced, I had several with Angels and visions, I understand that miracle of the encarnation while having a vision on March 25th of 1979, then more Angelical encounters, on Nov 11th 1979 I was taking to a horrific vision of the Hell, It was a very traumatic experience I know exactly that Hell exist and its not a place that no one will imagine, I make a promise to the Lord I will be good so I can never go to that horrific place, many times I still bringing that memory back to my mind just to make sure i don't loose my goal to become a better person. On December 8th 1979 I was on front of the Blessing Mary Mother of God and I was able to talk to her, to be on my knees and kiss her blessed feet, she was crying so sad that make me feel that I want to die for her, I didnt want her to cry like that, I offered my life for her. I kissed her feet my tears touched her wounded feet than turned to green roses, she consoled me too and I promised her to complete the mission that she asked me.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Only with the priest but he didnt believe me, so I kept the secret for 36 year like our Blessed Mother said, on 2016 I look for the priest she told me and I went to see the Pope at the vatican, I gave him a letter from our blessed Mother form 1979, the content only the Pope and I knew on that moment, it was a very strict warning. After a year nothing happened, I did contacted the Mexican priest from the Basilica, but they are so strict, they didnt believe me and warning me to keep the secret.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I had an experience on 1977 while we were on a beach on Mexico, I didnt know how to swim, so I entered on a pool and started drowning while I was trying to gasp for air, I saw a light and I started to pray, asking Jesus for Help, so I felt some one pulled my hair, it was my uncle he carried me out the pool, the next day I enter the edge of the ocean, I felt so much pain, I scream loud, my mom took my hand, I could walk, the bottom of my feet were bleeding on the center, like something sharp poked them. I could walk for a fews days, they said it was maybe the sharp seashells that dit it.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     Like a mencioned that was physical evidence that will definitely proof that it was real  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Until these days, the manifestation are growing bigger and extranormal phenomena still occurred, the premonitions and visions, dreams, message, everything like our Blessed Mother of God said will happen, the connection Guadalupe, Lassalette, Fatima, Lourdes and Akita is so strong and real. The Knowledge I receive from our blessed mother and lord Jesus about the secret codes on the Tilma of Juan Diego and the Shroud of Turin, is information that I have never share before, but its a most importan thing to do, specially because the Fatima message hasn't totally happened yet and our Blessed Mother instructed me on 1979 what to do and how.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   The apparitions continue to this days, actually descriptions and numerical formulas that are unexplained but that point on 1979 the last events like the flooding and earthquakes in Mexico City, how could that be possible people said, but the 9.19.1985 I received the invisibles stigmata, exactly 32 yrs ago I was almost 14 yrs old, everything written like our Lord Command , the physical changes on my body continue as well, things that could be unexplained to science but totally evidences that can help the human being to understand why the love of God is endless and the Eternal Life is the most important meaning in our lives to look forward  that miracles are real, the Lord Scripture is the only way to find the true, nothing alse should matter than his love.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         If that will be just one persone on this world to wants to listen and gave the opportunity to share this information and experience, I'm absolutely sure many souls will be touched, that this is not only my experience, it will be like everyone will remember things that happened on their childhood, if they only knew why Our father in Heaven send his only son to Save us, why he left so many signs but we need it to open the eyes of the heart to understand, to become child kind on our hearths again the plan has been delivered many times on different way through his prophets, must beloved Son Jesus, most loyal servant and wife Mary and her  Immaculate heart, the Holy Spirit, his angels, priest, ministries and children, his only One truth he is the Only One God and he love us all.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think you did great and nothing I will change, I'm so grateful to find you in my life, regardless what happen next, I said God Bless You Always for your work and dedication.
