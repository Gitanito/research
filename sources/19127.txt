and that morning in two of the
english-speaking newspapers there was a
picture of two UFOs so I had placed
those on his table where he was going to
be sitting and I said good morning mr.
president and sent him down and said
we&#39;d like to have some coffee and juice
and I said yes so while I was getting
bed he&#39;s looking at the papers I came
back in President Kennedy says what do
you think I looked at him I looked down
at the picture and I said well sir what
do you think
and with that magnificent granite is he
said I asked you first
I said what I&#39;ve learned we can&#39;t be the
only living beings in God&#39;s creation he
says you&#39;re right young man there is
considerable knowledge as far as the
actual being of UFO and et phenomena
that we&#39;re aware of today
