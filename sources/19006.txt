when you accept what this science is
showing us that we are all connected and
you then say well hold on a second if
we&#39;re not just connected with human
beings but we&#39;re also connected with the
plant life with the planet itself with
the entire animal kingdom and you begin
to develop that deeper sense of empathy
with all that who&#39;s to say that that
interconnectedness doesn&#39;t extend to all
the other planets to the cosmos if we
share that with extraterrestrials what
is that world look like if consciousness
and thought can affect something at a
distance and at a very great distance
even many miles or thousands of miles
away instantaneously what does that mean
for us communicating with the
civilization that is centered in the
science of consciousness and that is
their chief operating system it&#39;s not
electromagnetic they use it but it&#39;s
beyond that so now add to everything we
know about the internet and
communications that telecom and then at
a deeper level of transdimensional
physics that involve electronic devices
very clearly picking up intended
coherent thought that&#39;s what you&#39;re
dealing with it&#39;s like dr. John&#39;s random
number generator experiment on a cosmic
scale but at a level of perfection where
there&#39;s precision with the thought that
you project to it it&#39;s reception and
then it&#39;s activity interstellar
civilizations are using consciousness
assisting technologies and technologies
that assist their own consciousness both
and all their travel and communication
systems the central operating system for
any interstellar competent civilization
is the science of consciousness and all
the physics that go with that
