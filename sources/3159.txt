THE
SECRET TEACHINGS
OF]ESUS
By
Dr. M. Doreal
Those who have delved deeply Into Biblical lore
know that the sayings which we have in our Christian
Bible, in English translations, comprise only a very
small part o fthe true teachings of Jesus. We know,
also, that Jesus taught two separate, and distinct
teachings; that is. he taught one teaching to the great
mass of people, and another teaching to those who
were able to understand. We have evidence of this
in the gospel of Matthew, where the disciples,
questioning Jesus because he taught the people in
one manner, and themselves in another, received
this answer: "Unto you it is given to know the
mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but unto them
it is not given, because seeing, they see not, and
hearing, they hear not, and will not understand, for
their eyes are blind and their ears closed, and they
will not understand." This is sufficient evidence,
alone, to prove to us that there must be some hidden
teaching above, or beyond, that which was given to
the great mass of people. Ifwe realize that the things
which we have been taught, and have been living
by, are those things which were given to people who
had neither eyes to see, nor ears to hear, and could
not understand, we begin to wonder why it is that
we are expected to advance, develop ana find God,
unless we have some means of gaining access to
those mystery teachings.
Of the life of Jesus, very little is shown in
-1 -
the Bible. For instance, we have, altogether,
about three years of his life that is touched up^
the Bible. We have his birth, the age of 12. then he?
disappeared until the age of 29 or 30. when we have
about three years of his teachings Resolved down
to its final analysis, we are told only of about forty-
two days in the life of Jesus.
In the Fast Jesus was known under another
name than Jesus. In the East we find that a great
deal more is known about the life of Jesus than it is
in the Western World, for instance, about the ages
between twelve and twenty-eight. ' *
m I want to say, briefly, that after he was twelve
years of age he went to Egypt for a time, and their
after that he spent five years in a Tibetan Monastery,
and then five more years teaching and healing in
India, before he returned to Palestine. Jn India he is
still known under the name of Vikata.
* • - tfiCi b — ; v . f ’
*
I myself spent over eight years in India and Tibet.,
I spent two years in a Monastery in which Jesus
spent five years of the ynknown period in his lif$,.
and while there, discussing with one of the Lamas;
the Christian teachings, he’said. "We krioW more
about the teachings of Jesus than do you in the
Western World because he spent five years here. "
and ne asked me if Iwanted to see the manuscnpts
of Jesus. When I examined them I found that they1
were composed of rolls ofparchment with the letters
written on them with a black material that looked
like paint. It stood out like it-had beerv applied with-
a brush, and the letters were in Aramaic characters
Aramaic was the language which was common in
Palestine at the time of Jesus: Hebrew was a dead
language even at the time. It was only the high priest
that read from the Ancient Hebrew, and the lesser
priests would read from the Targums. which w
ere
in
- 2 -
Aramaic.
The main object of this article tetogiye you some
selected verses from the works That I faad in the
Tibetan Monastery, and explain them tQ you. The
orthodox Christian Interpretations of the teachings
of Jesus are very much reinterpreted.; |h the fifst
place the Christians say that he died for theta, white
hp said, There is no death." What he said. was. "I
gp to show you the way into eternal life, "so they
say. that he died for then* Orv that basis the very
foundation principle of our orthodox Christianity is
erroneous. Jesus was an Avatar, a Sun of God. He
came to show mean a path so that they could again
return into the light that they;bad lost The trouble
was he did not find many that were able to receive
that Light: ' Y . •
In these passages that I am going to give you,
you will only find a few fragments of those scrolls
that I xead. that are in the Bible They were in the
form of notd$:'\hey were thoughts, or sayings, that
Jesus, puf c^dwri as. they occured td him, so these
thingsthat),wifigive are fragmentary and I am going
td try,to connect them as much as possible.
I have, complete transcriptions of the thirty two
scrolls p ra y in g s and two which deal with other
thingsentirely. Some day{ hope to be able to publish
them. I am working under instruction aH the time,
not from some unseen guide or spirit, but by the
direction of the Great Teachers of the White Lodge.
The first of the sayings that I want to give you is
a very peculiar one in the form of a question. The
question is this: "How long shall death reign?" and
the answer was, "As long as woman give birth, for I
come to make an end of
- 3 -
the works of woman." Birth and death are each the
completion of the other. They form two points of a
circle, a beginning and ending. He came to make
an end of birth and its consequence, death, because
his work was to cause the ego or soul of the
individual to so unfold that it mastered death, and
by mastering death it would free itself from the
Wheel of Life, and therefore, from Re-brith. He could
only make an end to death by conquering the causes
for rebirth In other words, by teaching men the Truth,
they could remove themselves from the-Wheel of
Life and he would thus enable them to overcome
the necessity for rebirth.
The next statement is this: "I stood on a high hill
and saw a tall and a short man. and heard a voice
as of thunder and I drew near to hearken; and it
spoke to me; 'I am thou, and thou art I, and where
thou art, there am I also; and in ail things am I sown.
And from whencesover thou gatherest me, in
gathering me thou gatheiest thyself.The tall man
and short man were, in the ancient Hebrew
Mysteries, considered as being Do, and man, the
Great Man, was called in the Kabbalistic Mysteries,
Adma Kadmon. He was the man of the Greater or
Divine World, while the short man was the lesser
Adam, the race of man. of human mankind
He saw upon the hill the tall man and the short
man standing together side by side, and he heard a
voice saying, "I am thou, and thou art I," and he
said this: "Where I am thou art also." Where the
lesser man of the material world exists, there also
exists the Divine World there I am. I also am in all
things, and when thou gatherest me thou gatherest
thyself." In more simple form he gave this to the
mass of people when he said, "I am in the Father
and the Father is in me and ye are in me." In other
words, all is one in the Divine Man The high
- 4 -
hill is considered to be the hill of the skull because
in the Ancient Mysteries a skull-shaped hill
represented the heaven-world, "thehead of.man. The
giant man. and the lesser man had-evolved to the
point where he had reached the apex of the world;
and there fore, stood by the tall yman; he htfd
conjoined himself with the Great and Dfvine Man.

The next statement is this: It concerns the coming
of the Kingdom of Heaven. "When shall the Kingdom
come? When two shall become one, that which is
without as well as that which is within, and the male
with the female, neighther male nor female." A great
many of those writings and scrolls were put in the
form of a question and then he answere the
question, and he answered this in this manner:
"When two shall become one, that which is without
as well as that which neither male or fe m a le H e
expressed it in the words of the Christian Bible in
this form, in answering a question, about marriage
or giving in marriage. What did he mean? In the
beginning, before the soul incarnated in the animal
body, it was positive and negative in one; the male
and female were a duad in a monad. We are taught
in the Ancient Wisdom that "God created man after
his own image, male and female, created he them.”
Therefore, we know that God, the Divine Spirit in
manifestation is both male and female in one arid
the original state of man was both male and female;
this was not referring to the physical body, but rather
to the polarity of the soul. When man fell, that soul
was divided into two parts and throughout the path
of life the attraction between the two sexes has been
caused by the pull of the positive and negative to
again blend and become one. This is the source of
the law of attraction between the two. We are told
in the Ancient Wisdom, at thatthis was the beginning
of the doctrine of twin souls.
It divided to form the two polarities, positive and
negative, and in the end that soul will again become
one, not in the material plane, but in the spiritual
plane, when it comes to that point when the
animalistic nature is conquered, then the two
polarities of soul again become one and the Christ
Consciousness appears. Where the duad becomes;
- 6 -
the monad, the two become orje again as they were
in the beginning. In that state th& male and female
because they are then the one consciousness,
blended into the Christ state.
Jesus was male-female, the two in one, and this
is the state that is attained by those who attain to the
absolute at-one-ment with GtxJ because we know this:
that in the material world two polarities are necessary
for manifestation You cannot even find gold in the
fo u n ta in s without finding two kinds of rock present,
bull quartz and the mother lode. This is true in the
animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, and is also
true in the Spiritual Kingdom. In the instant when they
attain the Christ Consciousness they enter fully into
the Kingdom
The next statement: " Ask great things and the
small shall be added unto you; ask heavenly things,
and the earthly shall be added unto you." The mistake
that so many of us make is that we ask great things,
and we get little. We do not ask for heavenly things
and have all earthly things added to us. In the Bible it
is expressed in this manner: “Seek ye firsi the
Kingdom of Heaven and all these things sha:! be
added unto you," that is, seek not the things which
loom great in your material mind, but seek for heavenly
fhjna?, seek the spiritual and all of these things of
earth shall come to you
Here is another statement that I think contains a
beautiful thought It is expressed in another 'way in
the Christian Bible That is this: For those that are
weak I am weak: for those that hunger. I suffer
hunger, and for those that thirst, I suffer thirst.” We
find this statement completely given in his injunction
to his disciples when he said. "Go ye forth and be ye
afl things to all men.” He said go out among men. be
able to enter into any condition of their life, under-
- 7 -
stand the things that they are seeking to express in
their lives. Only thus, can you help them. You cannot
help man in a cave or mountain; you are not even
going to help yourself Wherever you come into
contact with men, think as they think, feel as they
feel and yet, hold your balance, and attunement with
Divine Spirit.
Again, Jesus said: "There are three principles
In the Univorse; the Deity, the Father or Spirit: the
Creative Power, Elohim; and the World soul From
Elohim and the World-soul, twenty-four Cosmic
powers or Angles come forth; twelve the Nature of
the Mother-soul. The lower twelve are the World-
trees of the Garden of Eden. The trees are divided
into four groups of three each, the four rivers of
Eden." Iwill try to explain that as clearly as possjble.
First, we find that there are three principles in
the Universe: The Deity, the Creative Power, and
World-soul. What are these'? First: Deity is the
Source of all things, the Divine and Intangible
Essence; the Elohim is the World of the Breath of
the Divine, that which is spoken of in Ecclesiastes
as ‘Hebeir, or Divine from the old Hebrew is actually.
'Divine Breath’ and ’Elohim' is the Divine Breath or
word which comes forth from the all-pervading
Essence, the Divine Light, or as the Kabbalists called
it, the Ain Soph Aur.
The W orld-soul is the Spirit of Life which
pervades all matter, including the animal body of
man, the lesser animals, the vegetable kingdom and
mineral kingdom. It is the life force of the world, the
world-soul, the creative spirit of the Divine, and the
Divine Source of all things.
8 -
"From the Creative Breath, the Divine Breath and
Spirit or Force of Life." In our Christian Churches,
Spirit and Soul are considered as synonymous. The
Soul was the Divine Essence in man. the Spint was
the Force of Life which is inherent In all living things.
;That is expressed in Ecclesiastes in mistranslated
version as. "Who knoweth the Spirit of man which
goeth upward and the Spirit of the beast that goeth
downward to the earth7'Correctly translated this is,
"Who knoweth the soul of man which ascended into
the heavens and who knoweth the Spirit ofthe animal
body which descended into the earth?" The Spirit or
animal body is part of the World-soul, came forth.
The soul of man is a conscious part of that Divine
Essence, from the Creative power, that is . the Word,
which moved upon the face of the waters. The waters
pf Genesis were the World-soul, the life force or
energy. The Divine Breath moved on the face of the
water and God said, "Let there be light and there
was light, and light was the first creation of the Divine
Spirit of the Spiritual plane, the Supernal Angels of
the twenty-four spheres of the primal creation
Remember where you read in the Book of
Revelations, about the twenty-four Spirits before the
throne? Those twenty-four are the first manifestations
of creative power or expression They came into
creation before the World-soul and they formed the
powers or agents through which the Divine created
man. Those twenty-four are symbolized by the twelve
Spiritual centers, and twelve material centers in
man's Astral body, the twelve great Spiritual centers
which are found in Ns head and the twelve material
centers through which that power is expressed
We are told that "twelve follow the will of the
Father-Spirit;" the Elohim, they are the channels
through which the Divine Power flows, and "twelve
follow the will of the Mother." Then they say this:
"That the Ipwer twelve are the World-trees of the
Garden of Eden and the trees are divided into four
groups of three each, and they form the four rivers
of Eden ” In other words, Eden and the four rivers
of Eden are within your own body Did not Jesus
say, 'The Kingdom of heaven is within?" And the
four rivers and twelve manners of fruits of the Tree
of A Life In the old Hebrew it says, "And the Tree of
Life bore twelve manners of fruits" In the Christian
Bible it only speaks of the Tree of Life. Those four
rivers are three divisions in twelve channels in the
body of man, through which the Divine Spirit flows.
They are the twelve houses of the Zodiac of the
Astrologer even though. Astrologers as a rule have
no concept of the Occult Laws behind,their Astrology
as there are not many who have delved deeply
enough into the mysteries.
The next statement is: "The Elohim is symbolized
as a woman above, and a serpent below. From the
Serpent came forth animals and from the woman,
man." Rather a peculiar statement, is it not?
Remember that Elohim was the Creative or Divine
Spirit of God. The Divine Spirit manifested into the
lower world in which negation or inharmony was
found The woman represents the upper or spiritual
nature in man; the serpent represents the animal
body and nature of man. From the Divine Spirit was
formed the soul of man, but from serpent, the lower
manifestation in the World-soul was formed, the
animal body of man and thus, man is dual in nature;
and we are told that the woman bruises the head of
the serpent. In other words, that the Spiritual stands
upon the material and the woman must crush the
serpent, the animal or material, before the Elohim
can return to Deity, the Source from which it sprang.
- 10-
The next statement from those scrolls: "When man
was formed, Eden and Elohim depute their powers
unto him: the World-soul bestows on him the Soul,
and the World-spirit infuses into him the Spirit." In
other words, man is a composite being, man is
composed of Spirit, form or his animal body, and he
is composed of soul, his Spiritual nature, and he has
in his nature Eden, the three combined ih one This is
the man of the triangle, as shown by the Brahmins
and as used in the Kabbalistic mysteries, thb triad in
man, Spirit, Soul , and that balanced equilibnum
between Spirit and Soul in which lies Eden, into which
he can enter if he will. The trouble is not enfough of us
will.
The next statement "The real 'man' is male-
female,-devoid ofsex therefore he strives to abandon
the animal nature where there is neither male nor
female, but a new creature.” That is. the real 'man' is
neither male nor female. He strives to abandon the
animal nature where he is divided or separated and
return to the pure Spirit where he becomes two in
one. l am not speaking of abnormal individuals who
are sometimes called hermaphrodites. That is a
psychological condition. This is an entirely different
thing. It is the two parts of the soul blended, not
become two in one. but one which has all the powers
of dual creation
The next statement "Forthis is the Gate of Heaven
and this is the House of God, where the Good God
dwells alone, into which no impure man shall come,
no psychic, no fleshly man but it is kept under watch
for the Spiritual alone, where they must come, and
casting away their garments, all become bridegrooms
made virgin by the virginal Spirit. For such an one is
the Virgin with child, who conceives and brings forth
aeon, which is neither psychic, animal nor fleshly.
-11 -
but a blessed aeon of aeons." What does this mean?
It means very simply this: That the goal of mankind
is to return to God in whom there is no division, only
eternal oneness and that into that condition, no.,
impure thing, no impure man. can como. If you have,
in your consciousness, your mind, your nature, fear,
hatred, anger, inharmony, you cannot approach God.
Do you remember the statement in the Bible,:
"Only the cure in Spirit shall know God.'' That is why-
so many of you have been unsuccessful in your
attempts to find God. because you have approached
Him >na condition which God refuses to recognize
as part of His nature. God only recognizes, and,
attunes with that which comes to him in perfect
peace, quiet, calmness, harmony, and purity.
The is no psychic because the psychic deals witty
demons, elemental forces and other things Yog.
know, too many people seek ohenbnfena, rathen
than seek to purify themselves so that they can come
closer and closer to the Divine Spirit Know that your,
path to manifestation of true power is the changing
and transmuting of your lower nature
Again. "No fleshly man," that is ho one that is*
bound by bondage ot the earthly body.,We must
free from the flesh, that does not mean die, but be!
able to separate the intelligent consciousness fronri
its bondage to the flesh, so tnat we can ascend iniw
the Spiritual planes. When we can feave behind all
n e g a te arid impure thoughts then wh cart enter thd1
Spiritual plane and oome as a vlrgfh t>ridd. because
all disorder has been washed away; it has been left
behind and we are made virginal by the virginal spirit;'
because our spirit has then become two in one. This'
is really becoming an ascended Master;
.jo. * f
.
,»
\n o tt& n sm * ;•
when the two become one and ^here is only the
one Spirit of God manifest in the vehicle and when
we can enter into that state we bring forth a son,
but that son is ourself, the Sun of God.
"It is neither fleshly, psychic, animal, but is a
blessed aeon of aeons" It exists from the beginning
to the end. because what has come forth from the
bondage of life is the pure soul of man which has
been bound by the bounds of flesh.
The next statement is one that deals with
Reincarnation, where he says this: 'That the soul
must pass through every kind of existence and
activity in Its cycle or rebirth ." In other words, it must
meet every kind and condition of life and then free
itself from it. We are told that "A Master is one who
has mastered circumstances, and things instead of
being mastered by them." We are bound to the cyde
of birth, death and rebirth, until we overcome and
master life, and the lower nature of ourselves.
The next statement: "Perfection is attained by
those souls who, led on by remembrance of their
former conditions, soar above all limitation of the
higher Unity." In other words this: That when we
look back upon our life, after certain development,
• leam from the mistakes of the past, what to avoid
in the present, from the inharmony of the past how
to create harmony in the present and when we do
so we begin to soar above and beyond the
limitations of the flesh and the environment and
earthly conditions around us. We center our
attention in the Higher Unity rather than diversity.
The next statement is very dee^ ’""or what sort
of emanation is there rv * cort

of matter must we make supposition, in order that
God should form the Universe, like as a spider
weaves its web from itself? But "He spoke and it
was," and this is the meaning of the words of Moses,
where he said, 'God said." Let there be light and
there was light.'" Whence, then was the light? From
naught For it is not written of the only from the Voice
of the Speaker of the Word. And He who spoke the
word was not; and that which was. was not. For the1
Seed of the Universe, the word that was spoken,
’Let there be Light’was from the state beyond being.
And this is the True Light which lighteth every man
that comethTnto the world Man both deriveth this
principles fflontthe Seed and is enlightened by it.
This primordial Light and Life is the Source of all
things."
Man, living in a world of form and substance, is .
accustomed to measure God by his oWn idea of-
form and substance That is what man's concept qF
God is. Man may conceiveofGod to be the lightning^
fire, or the ocean, but is God something? No, God
is not something; God'is not, because God is without
limitation, center or circumference, G0d.i5
F.the Great
Nothingness which contains all things. And T ie :
spoke the word and the universe was created but
what was it created from? Frpm nothing. It.W&S
created within and as a pari of God just "As the.
spider spins a Vneb from itsfelf" andthdi) the "Light
of God moved and the Universe was created." The
Light of God is the true nature of being beyond from,
and that is the true"Light which lights every man in
the world, and, therefore, man must withdraw from
form before he can find the true nature of the
formless God."
The old teaching of the mysteries said this

Another statement: "The Sons of Godarethe Dtvine
sparks, the real Spiritual man within, who.have been.
left in the seed-mixture, to order and informand correct
and perfect the souls which remain in the downward
state ofexistence.” Theseare the Spiritual Avatars who
have never been bound in the flesh, excepting as they
took on flesh of their own accord. They^exist in the
Divinefor the purpose ofguiding, and teazling man back
into that same state of oneness of "consciousness
Them « a statement that I want you all to remember,
it )s the name which Jesus is known by in all-planes,
and spaces. Remember how.Jesus said, 'They cast
out devils in my pame?" TheChurch says this was the
name of Jesus, but this is not the name. This is the
reason^ that they pave had dissensions and fights,
because they have never known the secret name that
Jesus taught tjis discipies, whereby they coujd.call him
frdm the furthest reaches of infinity. This'name is his
s6^l name, whipfi remains a part of his beingthroughout
all ages I am really translating this literally, "Amen,,,
Amen, J say unto you. my name through the Ages is
Aberamentho. If thou wouldst know the first mystery
call upon me by the name my Father has given me."
This knowledge, that the sould had a name other than
the hame of the pddy is known to every race in the,
wptld. except 6m modem.English race Even our
American Indian had a secret name bywhich he called
the child So did the early Irish, and the Hindoos Thte
name of the soul has been the concealed name.
- 15-
and Jesus gave that name to those that he inducted
into the mysteries so that they could call him when
the need arose.
The five great words of power that Jesus used
when healing the sick, and casting out devils, were
the following Zama. Zama, Ozza, Rachma, Ozzai."
By these words I cast out demons.” Later, he wrote
a full length as to how he used those words to cast
out demons.
In further passages he went on to explain that
Zama, Zama, was the create and uncreate power
of the Divine and that Ozza. Rachma. Ozzai. were
the words of power which vibrated the three great
center of energy in the head of man that the Hindoos
called Rajas. Sattva, and Tamas. Rajas and Tamas
are Cain and Abel, the centers of activity and
inactivity in the Hindoo mystery teachings They are
preserved in the old Bible as Cain and Abel, and
according to the further writings of Jesus, those
words had power to restore the dead Abel to life.
As that power expelled the imperfection of the body,
the healing would take place and if there was a
negative or inharmonious spirit around, it would be
driven away, as by a mighty wind.
