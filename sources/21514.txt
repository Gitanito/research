INTRODUCTION
Great men and women in all ages have been
endowed with psychic power. You carmot be
notable in any line of worthwhile endeavor
unless you are attuned and helped by invisible
forces, whether conscious of it or not. You
feel drawn toward those people in whom the
magnetic force is strong and similar to your
own; they only become popular and admired.
It behooves all who come in contact with the
public to cultivate this finer force. It may be
said with assurance that the next generation
will come in upon us freer, more magnetic and
better attuned. They will be living radios.
Quick perceptions and super mental gifts will
be theirs with less effort than we enjoy at the
present.
The physical body is a most important
vehicle, if from earliest childhood the body
is kept well nourished, free and easy, unhamp-
ered, untaxed. Without cramming the brain,

better results from " insight" as from mental
observation and brain calculation. Tumult
and overactivity in the mental world is a stum-
bling-block for finer development. I t is not
how much you have crammed into your brain-
self that counts, but how much and how well
you can bring it out and ex press it for good
use.
From a practical as well as from a scien-
tific viewpoint conscious psychic development
is a great aid to human growth. W hen you
know how to use your finer forces, you will not
stoop to anything that is contrary to good
taste.
Systematic development is advisable, no
short cut, no hurry, but sensible guidance com-
ing through accomplished teachers. They can
point the way to your highest goal.
The old type medium is being replaced by
the newer, the more scientific one, who is able
to ex plain the whys and wherefores of phenom-
ena. At best so much still remains unex plain-
ed because this field is so vast and rich, that
much ex ploration is still req uired.

Remember there is no short cut to spiritual
development. Y ou must proceed step by step;

Nothing can be of real value or use before

Remember there is no short cut to spiritual
development. You must proceed step by step;
cultivate, nurture and bring out into visibility
what is now latent within you. Caution
should be used not to overdo, so as to avoid

Nothing can be of real value or use before

ber. Each spiritual gift will be presented in
sequence so that you can see where you fit in.
Wlrat is your spiritual gift? Do you heal?
Do you make others happier with your pres-
ence? Do people confide in you easily? Are
you willingto help when you are called upon?
Then know you are a conscious healer, and

I NSPI RATI O N
Do you feel inclined to ex press yourself
freely? I f you do it intelligently and sensibly,
you are tapping the inspirational plane. Y ou
may attempt this phase of mediumship but
bear in mind inspiration can only crown you
when you have prepared the way (that is your-
self), by study, reading, meditation and ex -
pression.
The Unseen will transmit to you that
only which you can assimilate and ex press
intelligently. The rosy road to inspiration is
achieved by constant practice. Proficiency is
obtained when you acknowledge what you
know and look forward to receiving more ad-
vanced knowledge that will surely come forth
in due course of time. Under all conditions,
during development, never ex pect something to
come or burst upon you unawares.
Spirit is scientific, therefore in perfect accord
with natural and spiritual law. Use what you
know and more will be given you.

Suffice it to say, your own inner growth

Psychic gifts manifest gradually and only
with persistent effort. They come easier when
you are mindful of an all-around development.
Much takes place during development that
is seen and much more that is never revealed,
not even during one' s entire lifetime.
The road to this attainment is usually strewn

TRUTHS ABOUT PSYCHIC
SCIENCE
Every person is to a degree psychic, some
more, others less. The subject under consid-
eration would become too complicated, should
this be explained in detail.
Suflice it to say, your own inner growth
is responsible on what plane you are now func-
toning and how far you have evolved your
psychic self.
Psychic gifts manifest gradually and only
with persistent effort. They come easier when
you are mindful of an all~arounddevelopment.
Much takes place during development that
is seen and much more that is never revealed,
not even during one's entire lifetime.
The road to thisattainment is usually strewn
with thorns in the form of handicaps; such as

a state of consciousness to want to pursue such
studies. Y ou had to earn it, sometime, some-

the Power in helping mankind, but you may
not use it for selfish purposes.
W hen using the Power in the right way the
Supervising I ntelligences will shield and pro-
tect the psychic I nstrument and keep him on
the earth plane till the service rendered reaches
those destined to receive his help.
V iewing higher psychic developing sanely
and without bias, one well versed in this
science comes to the conclusion that the medium

human organism. They feel too keenly any

The Psychic and Medium can find solace
and peace only on planes where peace prevails,
where the ether waves are lighter and where
order and harmony is the key-note.
The contrary state has a confusing and dras-

development without preparation get into con-
flicting and sometimes obsessing conditions.
Their mode of living and thinking tend to make
them abnormally sensitive. Their thoughts

The foregoing reveals facts about Psychic

CONCLUSION
It is a mistaken idea thatMediums are nega-
tive. Wlrat proof is there to justify this er-
roneous statement? The fact is, that highly
unfolded mediums and psychics are very posi-
tive. They rely on themselves, they co-operate
with the unseen, in love and obedience and not
in negation, as it is often asserted.
To appear before the public, to expand any
philosophy,to definitely convey ideas, all re-
quire a positive personality. How could it be
done otherwise?
It behooves all who want to develop them-
selves for greater work, to unfold their psychic
power. This should be done for various rea-
sons.
First: when you go through certain ex-
periences yourself, you believe without doubt-
ing or taking anyone else's word for granted.
It is proof to you, especially in psychic matters.

ble world where the five sense consciousness
fails to discern. Because of your unfoldment,
you dare do things you would not do otherwise.
Few persons can ex press what they know and
feel within them— they live and die repressed.
E ven a fine intellect is not always much of a

I t takes half one' s time and effort to develop
mediumship. The guiding forces that help
along are perhaps more lenient toward their in-
strument while development goes on. W hile
the psychic must never stop unfolding, always
giving an ear to what step to take nex t, help-
ing others in a constructive way, he is an in-
strumentality, yet not as much subj ect to outer
forces as the medium is ex posed to at all times.
