        Summary:&nbsp;    From Pat Deveney's database:

  Theosophical Worker, The. 
  1939--1946  Monthly
  Adyar, India. 
 Publisher: C. Subbarayudu, at the Vasanta Press. 
 Editor: George S. Arundale; N. Sri Ram.
  Succeeds: Adyar News --> Theosophical World (1936-1939)
    4/4-5, April 1939-11/3, March 1946. 
 24-28 pp.  Volume numbering continues that of Theosophical World.

 This was a supplement to the Theosophist and its price was included in the subscription price for that journal (18/- a year).  This and its predecessors (Adyar News and Theosophical World) were intended by Arundale specifically for the members of the Theosophical Society in contrast with the Theosophist, which was directed at a more general audience.  It was to be "a monthly journal printed at Adyar giving the busy Theosophist 'news of the family elsewhere.'"  It became in practice an exposition for members worldwide of the ceaseless work for the cause of the society's staff at Adyar and an exhortation for members of the society to work harder to propagate Theosophy in the dark days of World War II.  "Work Matters More!" was the regular introductory article by the editor.  The underlying tone of the journal is pessimism about the current status and the fate of the Theosophical Society.  C. Jinarajadasa, the new president of the society, incorporated the journal with the Theosophist in 1946.  NYPL; BL.
