  Originally two volumes a year were issued beginning with volume 1 in 1902, and then the volumes were numbered sequentially with the numbering (1-16) of the Journal of Hygeio-Therapy of Kokomo, Indiana, which the journal absorbed. "Reformed" spelling.  This was a Mormon version of Fowler and Wells' Phrenological Journal.  Schofield was a graduate of their American Institute of Phrenology and Miller was a "first-class Scientific Phrenologist" of the Haddock Institute of Phrenology in San Francisco.  It offered articles of general interest and progressive thought on diet, education, current fashions, "drugless medication," "prenatal culture," court reform, and the like, as well as regular excerpts from the writings of J.H. Kellogg, and sketches of prominent reformers and phrenologists like Newton N. Riddell.  As did many of its contemporary journals, the Human Culture Company offered its subscribers a discount book-buying Character Building Club, a Human Culture Institute, a Human Culture League (promoting "psycho-diagnosis"), and the like, and also promoted its own stock.  Noted in William C. Hartmann's Who’s Who in Occult, Psychic and Spiritual Realms (1925).
