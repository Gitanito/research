  		              		Experience Description   

    I remember being enveloped in a gray mist. Then I was surrounded by a light that I cannot describe; it was neither white nor blue. But it was brilliant and beautiful. I had the overwhelming feeling that all was good and that I was going home to Father. Although, I was not sure who father was at the time. I was in the arms of Father and held with a love that I couldn't comprehend.  I received a lot of information and remember hearing my oldest daughter's voice asking me to stay. I wasn't worried about my daughters, they would be okay without me. Then I heard my son say, 'Mom please stay.' I felt he wouldn't be okay without me because he was so young. Then I was back. I never shared this with my kids although I have told a few friends.

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     It was as if I got a ton of information at once about some flaws I need to correct. I also received  a big reminder that Judgment is not mine  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Green things that were alive glowed for weeks afterward. It was as if trees, plants and eyes 'hopped.'

What is your religion now?         Jewish     

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I thought we because  dust to dust after death. I was very surprised to find out I was completely wrong.  I am blessed to have had this experience, although it has left me a bit confused about the injustices here on Earth. I used to be able to hear about sad things and it would roll off my back.  Now, sad things cause actual physical pain in my heart when I hear them. That might be a sign of age, though.  
  
Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     My job is to leave every instance better than I found it.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   It was mostly emotional.  I was being held by Father and he was sharing a love that was awesome. It was the right thing to be happening.  
  
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I felt this was a universal passage  

Did you believe in the existence of God prior to your experience?         God probably exists  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I know there is a God now.  He held me in his arms and made me understand the word awesome.  
  
Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?         God definitely exists  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I felt like I had been let in on the secret of the journey to the afterlife. I am not fearful of dying now  

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Are possibly meaningful and significant  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No     God is the judge.
  
Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?         An afterlife probably does not exist  

  Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?         An afterlife definitely exists.     Yes.     I felt like this was the passage but not the end destination.  
  
Did you fear death prior to your experience?         I greatly feared death  

Do you fear death after your experience?         I slightly fear death  

Were you fearful living your life prior to your experience?         Not fearful in living my earthly life  

Were you fearful living your life after your experience?         Not fearful in living my earthly life  

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Are possibly meaningful and significant  

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant after your experience?         Are probably meaningful and significant  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     We are not here to judge. Judgement is God's job  
  
Were you compassionate prior to your experience?         Moderately compassionate toward others  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     Our relationships with everyone should be filled with loving intent  

Were you compassionate after your experience?         Greatly compassionate toward others  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life.     I was a good person before. But now I do things from my heart not because they are the right thing to do. I feel we need to leave every experience better than we found it because that one thing may be the reason we are here and we shouldn't miss that opportunity.  
  
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes They all matter more but then nothing really matters.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   There are no words to describe the emotions. The word 'awesome' is as close as I can get. Some other words could be loving, peaceful, accepted, and perfect.
  
  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I still have very strong emotions about this incident and I can cry when I think of it. These are tears of joy, not sadness. I find these emotions embarrassing since it has been so many years ago, but it still is as vivid as yesterday. My heart still swells with excitement when I remember the warm light and the love of Father.  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I never told my kids but I have shared with a few friends.  Some are honestly interested and others scoff.  I am hesitant to share because I am fearful of the reaction I might get.  
  
  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Just saw them on TV specials  or read about them in the newspaper. Nothing concrete.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     My doctor was my running partner, so he was really vested in keeping me alive. He thought I was home already after the initial surgery but he saw my daughter in the elevator. He learned that I was not doing well at all. I now had peritonitis and a small bowel obstruction. He rushed me back to surgery. When I woke up after the last surgery, I found him frantic and teary. I thought more about it after he said, 'You are so lucky, you know you almost died!' I could have told him about Father and the light then but I was afraid he would think I was nuts. I have never told him.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I think we all experience the same passage and perhaps we create religion to explain this passage to add comfort. I still have feelings of confusion about what life might be about, but probably everyone does.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         This is the only time I have written about my experience.  I was a bit uncomfortable but maybe if I took it again it would be better.
