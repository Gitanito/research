Deluge be\ng asked of Deu-
calion and Vyrrha^ how Man-
kind fwept away with the over*
flowing of the Waters^fhould again
be reftored and multiplied , com-
manded them to throw over their
heads the Bones of their Great
Mother : the which Oracle they
rightly interpreted concerning the
ftonesof the Earth , and thereby
attained their delired end 5 For
which caufe 'ihemis was afterwards
accounted the firfi Promulgatrix
of Laws. But without doubt Her

the ancient Poet^^ who fuppofed

kind was generated by two ftones^
the Male, and the Female, whence
proceeds the wonderful! multipli-
cation

his Wife that he kils her^ and thca
bewraps her with hib bloody man-

the true knowledge of the Cracle^

only an Hiftory , and thence draw
fooie wholfome Morals^which 'hz\t
have no place , neither were they
ever intended.

For feeing it is as much the Pro-

cioufly to determine^as it eflentially
belongs to a bird to fly, or an horle

advifedly feigned Ihemis to he the
Daughter of Heaven :iid Earth, to be
the Sifter of ^^^twr^jand Aunt to Jupiter^
and have done her very much honour,
and celebrated her Fame, becaufe (he (o
conftantly adminiftred Juftice; forE-
qiiity and upright deiling were by her
cnjoyned, and all Vertues which might
render men either acceptable to the gods>
or ferviceablf to each other, were to be
embraced. She therefore taught them ta
live ;ulHy and contentedly,* to (hun vio-
lence, in;uries and robbery , that they
fhould ask nothing of the gods ( as Feftus
obferves ) but what (hould favour of ho-
nefty and Religion, or otherwrfe that
their prayers would have no good ifTue,
She furthermore faid that the great God
did look down upon the earth, and view
the aft ion's of men, whether good or evil 5 poi
andthathefevercly punifted the wicked Jnd
for their iniquity with eternal punidi-
ment; that he rewarded the good for
their integrity with a life which (hall
neither end nor decay.
Others were cf an opinion that thiAav
ofthe Rofecriiciam* ^

Grecians, and did foretel what fhould
happeh, by which endowment (he got
great Authority ; (b that they efteemed

When (he was accoiinted the GoddeO'e of
Juftice, by her Kings held their Domini-

to their Subjects, and made the rudemul-
cy titude pay due honiage and fubjefiion to

ly ftru(^ure of Politicks 5 for which caufe

iDorced, They erected Temples to her,

and this folemnity the Roman Patri-

This Equity is that rule by which men
DUght to frame their words and actions.

great comfort and advantage of man-

ihofe Laws vfhkh the Founder ofthis m

are all gocd and jyjt. ^'
AS no Rational man can deny the ab-

it IS moft fie that fnch Laws fhould have ^^
their due praifeand comaiendationsjthat ^^
ofthe RofecTHcians. j
'. le fluggard hereby might be pricked on
Vertue, and the diligent might have
is dcferved reward.
jjj
Seing therefore that thefe Pofitions
J,,
T Laws, laid down by the Father of the
05
ionourable Fraternity are worthy o£
„,
pedal view, we (hall truly according to
,n heir nature, and the advantages men
jl
nay receive from them. Crown them

iOt onely worthy of acceptance, but an
[ncomium.
Firft it is moft reafonabie that every
Jociety if it be nood, fhould be governed
*y good Lawsi if otherwifejby bad : but
hat this Society is good and lawful, we
lo not ontiy iuppofe, but may gather
roni particular circumftances to which
heir Pofirions are agreeable.
Something miy be laid concerning
heir nu»nber of fix, which hath very
nuch of perfeftion in it ; (b that the So-
iety by an abundance of Laws is not in
:onfufion, nor yet by the paucity and
cwnefle tied up from all liberty. When
here are multitudes and great diverfity
DfLaws, we may probably conjefturc
^
hat there Will happen many crimes and
\
:normities5 for he that fleighteth the
B 4 ftreight
8 ihe Myfteries andLaws
flrdght path of Nature and Reafon, will
cercainly bemifled into many windings
and labyrniths before he comes to his
journeys end. From thefe inconvenien-
ces our Laws are free^ as well in quality
as number ; they are voluntary, and
fuch to whom all may eafily affent as
moft Rational.
They folloiv in their order.
1. That every one of them who (hall
travel, niuft profcflt Medicine and cure
Gratis. ,
2. That none of them^ notwithftanding
theirbeing of the Fraternity, Ihall bcen-^
'joyned one habit ; but may fuit theni^
felves to the Cuftome and Mode of thofc
Countries in which they refide.
3. That each Brother of the Fraterni-
ty (hall every yearc upon the day C. make
his appearance in the place of the holy
5pirit,orel(e (ignihe by Letters the true
caufe of his Abfence.
4. That every Brother (hall chufea
fit perfon to be his ^ucctflbur after his
deceafe.
5. That the word K. C, (hall be their
Scale, Charafter, or Gognifance.
6. That this Fraternity (ball be con-
ceal'd an hundred years.
The
of the Rofej^cians^ 9
The Brethren are folemnly fworn and
riftly cngfged to each other^to keep and
ibfervethefe Conditions and Articles;
1 all which we finde nothing either pre-
iidicial to themfelves, or hurtful and
njurious to others ; but that they have
excellent fcope and intention, which
I"s
the glory of God and the good of their
•Jcighbour. We (hall further profecute
ihefe things, and by running thorow
heir feveral caufes and circutnftances,
i'ive any one a greater 1 ight into them.
In the firft place, as touching thefirft
l\uthor of thele Lawes, it will be worthy
our conlideration to examine whether
le had power and authority to make
fuch Laws for himfelfe and others, and
b(f requiring obedience thereto; then
who was the Author ? and why his name
hath been hitherto concealed >
•
1 1 is moft certain that a Prince who is
gts^H were an Head to his Subjects that are
his Members, it is indeed a thing un-
iqueftionable, but that he hath full power
ibf making and ratifying of Lawes ; For
chiefly it belongs to the Emperour, then
to each King, becaufe they have right to
govern. Lafily it concerns any Princes or
Civil Magiltrates.

But Lawes that are brought in by In-
feriours, extend onely to thofe that have
-
a particular Relation to themj neither)
are they long lived, nor do they excufci
iipm the Lawes of Superiours, bdns, one-yjL,

^
Amongft the Andcnts thofe men who.
were of beft repute for their Wifdomey
Learning, Aurhority, Sincerity, and of,-
greateft Experiences, might fet up Lawes
in any City or Nation. Thus we fee
that Mofei was made Ruler and Chcifcain

frighted into good manners % for before ii

From what hath already been faid
lerc may be gathered thus much, viz.
H'1'hat any one hath liberty ( his Compa-
^ ions complying and faithfully enga-
ing ) to prefcribe Lawes to himfelfe and
leni, efpecially if fuch Lawes arcfoun-
ledupon Reafon and Equity; For fas

the wicked is unlawful, fo are thof*
bands that oblige them damnable^whoft
truftand fidelity are but true cheats anc
fure deceits ; their conftancy but obftina-
cy, their oaths curlings, their rules me-
thods of villany, their lawes are com

Our Author indeed was a private man
and no Magifirate ; but in his particulai
relation he was inveftcd with much Au'
thority, whereby he might oblige anc
binde others, be both Lord and Father ol
the SocietYj and the firft Author anc
Founder of this goldenMedicineand Phi-
lofophical Order. If any one fhall atccmp
toufurpe jurifdiftion over any againf
their wills and confent, he (hall findehii
labour to be in vaine ; for he muft need,
fuppofe them to have a prejudice againP
fuch dcfigne.^. fince he playes the Bifliof
inanothers Diocede: But certainly the
cafe is different here, becaufe by a fain
rcfignation they devoted theml'elves tc
his command.

Our Author is namelefle, but yet wor-

ut well known to his own Society. And
jme may ask the reafon of his conceal-

Wherefore the Father of this Fraterni-

Hence Galen concealed his Golden
Umplaifter for the Squtnaftcyy by which he m
got an hundred Crownes, which indeed
was in it felfe of little worth ; for there [|](
are many things of excellent ufe which if la
they

hey were divulged, would be foolifhly
lefpifed, becaufe vulgar hands pollute
jrhatever comes into them ; fome reafon
lay be why after they arc not fo Tuccef-

/orks not fo ftrongly, and defpond? as
o the cure from fuch (light meaner, and
hinders the operation ; (or although
nother mans imagination hath little
Dree upon mcjyct mine own much alters
he body, and either hinders or furthers
remedy in its working.
As this is cleare in many difeafes, fo
fpecially in Hypocondriack Mclancho-
y, called the flianie of Phyfitians, becaufe
arely cured; wherein the non*efiefting
f the cure depends upon the prejudiced
ih^nagination of the Patient, who defpairs

,0 al ter and change the blood, corrode
ihfjhe heart, overwhelmethe fpirits^ that
id hey cannot performe their offices; if
injberefore thefe can firft be removed, there
1 vei y great hope of recover y.
Under this Cloak many cover their
navery and covetoufnefle, who feek no*
hing but gain by their praftice; for
hey call their Medicines by great names,
hat the imagination of the Patient
E 4 clofing
56 ^he My^trks and tamf
clofing with fo rich apd precious remc- '«
dies may promote the cure ; and there- m
fore they compound their Medicines of 1
k
rare Ingredients, as Gold, Silver, Pearls, 8
Eezoar, Ambergreafe, Musk, and many 1 jci
more; and then they chriften themac- Ifi
cording to their birth. They call them o(

and Ojle of the Sim : and who indeed: p]

draw in and delude fuch multitudes o£ [fii

are not altogether infignificant 3 for by ^
their Baljom of Life^ they meanethai ai
which maintains and keeps thcmfelves |
alive.
But grant thefe coftly Medicines to bfl
good and ufeful, yet they muft confeffe
that others not fo chargeable have grea-
ter vertues in them.
We may alfo queftion whether they
deale honeftly, and do not fellalittlt
fait for Gold, and ranke poifon for the
Balfom of life-^ we have known fomeat
deaths door by their Mercury : I fpeak
this that others may be cautious h chink

arfly : thus they try experience upon
lens bodies, and kill one tofaveano-
ler.
Be(ides, though thefe may be very
Accllent Cordials or Antidotes, y e tae
at hey not appropriated to the difeafe, and
CD confequently little conducing to the
ilitreife.
Confidcrthen the abufe ; the Patient
eAays a great price for that which is of
mall advantage to him, and fcornes
5 hofe mcanes which are at an eafty rate 5
iDi vherein alio there is no danger, as being

It is not hard to prove that each Coun-
ry abounds with Simples fuitable to the
Oireafes of that Country, and that we
•ej leed not go Indiay or ufe Exotick
Drugs.
This Queftion hath been handled by
li(]
many learned men ; at prefent we will
not Ipend much time about it. We deny
tti not men the ufe in Food and Phyfickof

Neither would we be thought ignorant 01
of the great vertoes and rare efficacy oiin
Gold ; but we fpeak againft the abule of m
thofe Impoftors who inftead thereof do J
cheat and robbe ; and we can aflure all| iff
that there is no worth in the boiling and (t
reboilingof Gold ; They indeed gvi^%
their menftruous ftuffcs for diflblvecli!
Gold, which being reduced to a fpiriliw
may corrode ; and let all men beware of hi
it; imitating a carekfle Cook, who if K
he hath loft the broth in which the meat ri
hath been boiled, fets new upon the l
Table which hath no heart nor ftrength b
in it ; So they when they haveconfumed :ei
and loft thefr Gold with Salts and other i
wayes, they fell that which remaines ; («
when the Bird is gone they fell the Ncft 5 1(

Should any one enquire into the exccl-
ncy of our own Countries Simples, he
rai ould hive work enough upon his

me and place.
But befides the price^may we not Juflly

le faults of remedies we will come to
le faults of Phyfitians themfelves, by
a.hich fo many Pacients do and have
^/ifcarried.
They are commonly thcfe ; Self-con-

gno ranee, Joyned with agratftockof
[Confidence, or rather Impudence.
This Self-conceit becomes no man; if

md he who even now was lifted up

the earth. It is not true learning thaip
caufeth men to fwell, but an emptinefs
they fuppofe themfclves tobeknowin
men, when as indeed they underftaro
not the depths of Nature. Socrates h
learned a IcfTon of ignoranccjafter muchk,f

thefe vapourers would turn over a ne^^^^
leaf, they would fee their former pre

when two are fet againfteach oiher, theyd^,
endeavour by making thcmrdves a com-Q^,
mon laughing ftock, utterly to undo,f
both, and each at length is whip'd with,.,
his own rod. There is this benefit in
having an envious adverfary, that h<^
Ipends and wafts away; his malice feeds
upon hirafelf 5 To that it is better for any
man to deferve the envy of another rather
then his pittvj the one fuppofing hin\
happy, the other miferable; This vice
as the Ivie by embracing trees doth
fpoile them ; this vice I Cay clings to
great perfons5and fecretly corrodes their
Honour and Fame ; what noble exploits,
what vertuous deeds have been performed

defire do they endeavour after money ;iic
nay though they have one foot in the on

counterpoize them. Phyficians indeed |iii
above others are urnpted to this vice; for
when they grow old they are moft fought Im

of Magick, it being ©f it felfe fo honour-

oftentimes degenerate, and from Natural
becomes Diabolical, from true Philofo-

wholly to be charged upon its foil ower«j
who abufing or not being capable of
that high and myftical knowledge, do
immediately hearken to the temptatit^ns
of Satan, and are milled by him into rftc

Magick
9 2 ^he JUyJienes andLawes
Magick lies under difgrace^ and they who
feek after it are vulgarly cfteemed Sor- tl
cerers ; wherefore the Brethren thought
it not fie to ftile themfelves Magicians 5
butPhilofophers they are not ignorant
Enipiricks, but learned and experienced
Pbyiitians, whofe remedies are not onely
lawful bur divine : and thus we have
at large difcourfed of their firft Law^

MAny perhaps may blame my pro-
lixity upon the firft Law; to whom
I (hall anfwer, that weighty bufjnefles
are not to be perfunftorily run over;
twnfaftions in the little World may
onely
of ibe RofecTHcia^f. 93
oncly dcferve to be touched upon, but
the affairs of the great World ought to
have an anfwerablc coniidcration ; Co
that I muft ncceffarily crave pardon for
my brevity, because I could not wrap up
the due commendations of (iich fubjeds
in fo narrow a compafle.
This fccond Law gives birth to the
firft ', for without it the Brethren would
have no opportunity of doing good,
who by its benefit are fecure and fear no
danger : for as a Bird although it fing-
ethnot, is known by the colour of its
feather j fo every one accufloming him-
felf to one Habit is thereby diftinguiftied.
We findein Hiftory that many by their
enemies have been difcovered by their
apparel, and the difguife hath oftentimes
procured liberty. Otho being overcome

parts and abilities are cenfured by their

concealed muft not have a bejng ; tis a
Courtier who muft onely be accounted
a Schollar; but indeed the foul is cloath'd
with the body, which to adde ornament
to it needs no help of Taylours or Pain-
ters, it is grac'd with true Philofophy,
and fecret Arts are its glory.
Margaretha a Queen ofFrance is faid

There are yet many reafons which

Our Brethren change their Habit for
I vertUQUs end, which as it is not gaudy,
bit is not contemptible; they are al-
vaycs civilly clad, and not affededly,

There are many i^^aiej by which men Hwy

be deluded, as by a Fallacy, Equivoca-

cheate and deceive them.

Wherefore iince that the Brethren, be-
ing Mortals, muft certainly once ceafe to
be, and undergoe the common Lot oi

their Nature ; their wife Lawmaker did
not rafhly make this Law, that each Bro-
ther (hould chofe to himfelfe a fit perfon
to be his ^ucceflTour: in which choice they
do not look to the obligations offriendsj
their natural relation neither to Sonnes
or Brethren,but purely to Qualifications,
as Learning, fecrecy, Piety and other
fuch like endowments.
Amongft the Egyptians the Tonnes did
not onely inherit their Fathers eflate, but
ufed the fame trade and imployment, the
Sonne of a potter, was a potter, a Smiths
fonne was a Smith : But the Kings were
chofenout from amongft thePritfts, the
Pfiefts from amidft the Philofophers, and
the Philofophers were alwaies Sonnes of
Philofophers, but many times there hap-
ned a great difference of parts between the
Son and Father 5 outward Goods may be

The Philofophers would have my fteries

There were certain rites and Ceremo-
nies done at Athens in the honour ofPr<3-
vietheufy Vulcarty and Mefterva after thi^
manner : many were appointed to run in-
to the City with lighted torches, and he
whofe light was out, gave place to the o-
thers, fo that the viftory was obtained by
him who could come fir ft at the goal with
his flaming torch : The meaning was to
cxprcfs the propagation of fecrets for the
putting out of the torch is the death of a
Predeceffour, fo that another living with
his lighted torch fucceeds him, by which
meanes the rare myfieries of Chymiftry
come fafe to after generations.
Chymiftry indeed is a Science above all
Science?, the Mintrva that fprang from
JufiUrs braine^an heavenly ray which
doth difplay it felfe to the cornforiing of

underftanding , whofe propagation is a$
neceffary as that of the body : we may
obferve the antipathy of fome bodies to
others, and we may fee as great difference
in minds : mens difpoiitlons are to be

Some may aske why they have fueh an
Eleftion, and do not rather let their
knowledge be buried with them (or if not
fo unworthy) why do they not print,that
every one rnay have^read, and qnderftand

Firft, why do they leleft a few perfons ?
and will not have their fecrets perifh? we
anfwer, there is good reafon for both.

Wc may woefully lament the lofs of
ecrets which being writ have unhappily
^een burnt, not Wrft have been forgotten,
.hereforefor prevention of both it is con-
venient that they (hould be entrufted in a
"ew h^ndF, and by thofe careful be trans-
mitted to others. Before the flood, the
Arts were engraven on two pillars Icaft

The Heathens had their Colledges in
which were admitted none but fuch as
were of an unbiamt able converfation ^nd
of choice partsjfo that every one who was
educated in a Scholaftick way was not
thought a fit perfon to be of their Socie-
ties, but they would picke of themofta-
ble and they were few, the which rule is
obfcrved by the Fraternity of the R. C,
who admitted few and thofc upon good
defert.
In the next place we come to the rea~
fon why they do not print and make theii*

and Charafters of deep knowledge which
none might expound to others under
oath and the pleafure of the Gods.
Junior Philofophers have employed
all their paines and ftudy to finde out the
meaning of thcfc Hieroglyphicks : the
Phenix (properly belonging to Chy—
miftryj was accounted a creature dedica*
ted to the Sun, and this Embleme agrees
to all the holy marks : fo likewife the
R* C. have diverfe letters to difcover their
minds to their friends, and to coriceale ic
from others.
Their Charafters are K. C, which they

fcarcely be known to live when they (ball
not abide long t Their aftions are fuch
as become thofe who hope to appeare

How great is their madncfs who fpcnd

too often dangerous and deflruftive.
Wherefore fuch vices ftiould be covered
as filthy, that others may not be provo*
ked and ftirred up to the like enormities ;
nay let fuch things not onely be conceal'd
but buried, and things more profitable
be ufed in their rodme ; But if all good
and honeft fecrcts were brought to light,
1 dare fay, the Fraternity of the R. C.
would not be the laft as having no caufe
of fear upon them, but 1 doubt whether
yet we (hall fee thofe happy daies.
There arc many things bad which by
cuftome have been in good efteeme, and
the continuance of vice makes it be
thought at length Vertue : The Brethren
would give nooccafion of fufpition,for
that which is not known, cannot be pra-
ftifed ; without praclife no cuftome;
without cuftome no fuch miftake, al-
though their being altogether honeft need

We do not deny but that the beft thing
may be abufed, but that is not to be char-
ged upon the thing ic felfe $ but upon the
perfon foiraployingofit ; fonone can
truly fay that the Fraternity and Lawes
thereof are unlawful, whofe inftitution
and intention may be juftlfyed j but yet
envious perfons who have devoted them-
felve8 to malice may carpe at them; and
endeavour the ditfjtisfaftion of mens
minds) wherefore in this Chapter we will
(hew the profit and difprofir. ariling either
from them detefted or concealed.
There are four kinds of Good, Necef-
rary:,Honeft,Pleafant and Profitable, by
each of them men may be drawn to the
affcftation or difrslifh of any Subjeft ; the
two fiirft amongft thefe have the prehemi-
ncncy,the others are of Jefs authority ^but
yetvery often the latter prevaile above the
firft, and many had racher enjoy pleafure
and profit fiitable to their natures ; then
the others as being fomcwhat harfb,
wherefore we will treat of them, but not
as feparated from neceflary and honeft
Good.
To what purpofc fhould there be fuch
a Society, if the profit and benefit there-
of (hould be wholly concealed/ iheEr^i-
ofians

ofians and Jndtans kaving never heard of
their FtfWtf and Confelfion are not taken
with the Fraternity, but if they fhould
believe that there is fuch a feleft company
of men, yet they would beheedkfs, be*
caufe they (hould receive no advantage by
them : we care not for the r2chcft,minds,if
f
we cannot enjoy them, and affaires tran-
flated at a great diftance from us,are no-
thing to us,we do not take notice how the
Jndzam fight, and they negleft our Arts.
If the Fraternity had not made known
therafelves, there might feeme to have no
great damage thereby accrewed to lear-
ning, fince it is not more augmented ; for
heretofore cure of difeafes, and preferva-
tions of health were pradifed and profef-
fed, the Sciences have been fo refof-
med, efpecially the laft hundred years
pait, that they have attained their utmoft
perfection : On the contrary if the Fra-
ternity had been concealed, many might
have great hopes and expectations of pro*
fit, for all kind of curiofity had been laid
afide, men would not have vexed them-
felves with fearcbing dilligently, after
them5whom they (hould with the greatel)
difficulty hardly find, fo many defires
had not been unfatisfied, fo many pro-
mifcs
i54 ^^^ Myfterief andLawes
mifes fruftratcd, fo many fighs and tears
vain: laftly, no occafion of confufion,
butjbecaufeall thefe things are fo falfe
and abfurd we (hall not think them wor-
thy of an anfwerj we (hall therefore pro-
ceed to the profit of the Fraternity as it is
detefted and made known. There is in
the world fuch an abundance of all
things by-the diverficy of Species, multi-
tude of Individuallsthat itisalmoftim-
polTible to difcernc either their increafe
or decay. Hence is it that perfons of
Quality being taken av;ay by death are
not miftj becaufe others do fucceed them,
and the rifing Sun makts us take little
notice of the Set.
Had the Fraternity not been difcovc-
red, the world had lacked nothing ; for
that which is unknown is not deiircd and
fought afterj& the abfencc of it is no lofs,
and we doubt not but that there are very
manyfuch things in nature:who ever drea
med of a new world now called America
before it was found out? who thought of
ufefulnefs of wrinng and printing till
they were invented? but now it is fuffici-
ciently known what benefit the whole
world receives by them, although there
feemed before to be no want.

^
or as no line is fo long, nor any body fo
^ig, to which fomething cannot bead-
led ; fo the perfeftion of the world was
lot fo abfolute but that it was capable of
iddition.
Thus the deteftion ofthe Fraternity
did cncrcafe the worlds glory , and we
(hall (hew after what manner, viz,, by re-
vealing fecrets and finding out others
much conducing to the profit of man-
kind.
The Poets report ofAnteus that he figh-",
ting with Hercules, and by him beaten of-
ten to the ground, did as often recover
himfelf byvertue received from the touch
of the earth (for he was thought to be
Sonne of the earthy by which help he was
alwaies viftcrious^till he firove with Her^
culesywho finding out this myftery caaght
him in his armes and holding him in the
aire crufhedhim to death. By Hercules
is underftood a laborious and skilfull
Philofopher^ by Aniens thefubjeft to be
wrought upon, in which are contrary
Qualifications : This matter is not cafily
known, becaufe it lies hid everywhere,
and at the fame time lies open^underftand
thefirft inrefpeft of mens intcl lefts, the
other in refpe^t of Senfe^and if it were
known
t26 'iheMyJieries and Lavpes
known, yet the preparation is fo difficult'
little good can becxpeded, The Philo-
fophical esrth is his Parent whofevertue
isnoteaiily attained, Hence it is that
this Antem is fecrctly ftrengthned from
bfsmoihcr, and fo all endeavour of kil-
ling Anteus IS in vain and to no purpofe.
Therefore Of^ris being about to travel
intolndi^ did not unadvifedly confult
with 'Prometheus <i
joyn Mercury as a Go-
vernour, a.nd Hercules as Prefident of the
Provinces, by whofe direction and his
own induftry he alwaies accomplifhed his
end, he ufcd Vulcans (hop, the golden
houfe where Apis is fed and ivouriflied, for
thofe three forementioned have their fe-
verall offices in the Philofophical worke
:
but fon)e may fay what is this to the Fra-
ternity ofthe R.C, ,^ it properly apper-
taines to them, for they have overcome
Anteus , they have fufficiently declared
their Herculean ftrength, the wit of Mer^
cury^ and the Providence of Frometbeus :
This, this is the knowledge in which the
Fraternity is skilled, fetched from the in-
nermoft depths of nature j which to neg-
(ed or to fuffer to pcrifh were folly and
madnefs : There is no Chymifi who un-

ternity doe imitate both, fo that nothing
is wanting to hinder their perfeftion.
As for that reproach they lie under
concerning their difturbing of the Com-
monwealth, it is altogether falfeand by
them coined; therefore la it return upon

That there are fo many Herefies a-

the Fraternity that they are abufed , but
theirs who are fo wicked astocalumni-

and painful to advance their eftates; they
who bend their thoughts to change Com-

vate the Arts, make ufe of very often
moft dtfpicable infiruments to doe their
bufinefs : from this Tpring head hath
iffued many murmuring ftrcamesj fuch
Caufcs (\ fay) have produced many tu-

vain thoughts and foolifli dreame€,asit
now doth evidently appcare both in the
Artabaftifis and Enthufiafts : are there not
many even in this our age, who being
ambitious to be ringleaders in new waies,
inftead of a Reformation, havedifturbed
all order, and law /* they forfooth would
have Religion and Learning luit with
the irfentaftical ©pinions. ; ;; ^h
As foone as thefe had heard of thS
Honourable Society, they affuredthem-
ielve^ that their deiires would have an
happy iffue 5 for knowing thet thefe Bre-
thren were able in learning and riches,
they doubted not but that they would
imploy
134 ^*^ Myjleiries andBar^t
imploy both thofe talfents to caufe ah

therefore immediately promlfed to thcm-
felves one Empire, one Religion, unity
and concord 5 but in all thefe things-they
were belyed and abufedjfor they did never
affert any fuch things; neither is there
any ground of them in their writings
:
Out of their Books fomething may be
gathered concer»5ng the Reformation of
the Arts which was indeavoured by tht
firft Author about 217. years agoe, about
A, C. 1460. and at that time th6y had
heed of a Reformation ; witilefs the la-
bour and ftudy of eminent men who have
to good purpofe fpent their time to pro<
tnote learning, as Kudolfhm Agricola^ E-
rafmus Roterodammyl). Lutherufy phiiippus
MeldftchthomsyTheop, Faracelfus^Joh* Re-
gioffiOHtanusyCopernicusvjith many others!
and there is no doubt but the Arts may be
more encreafed, their Iiiftre more poli*
flied^many more fecrets difcovered. But
herein Religion is not at all concerned.
Let Rome therefore that Whore oiBahyloftj

may a reformation be produced , and

:hat thefe as they who are rich and po-
werful will not judge that true which
may any waies prejudice them , they I

However the Brethren fas all good men
