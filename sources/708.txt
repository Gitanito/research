Ts:a subsequent 'little Work owes its rise .....
progre111 to very trifling circumstances.:
In the early part of my life, having read many
books ~n favour of Ghosts and Spectral Appear..
IUJces, the recollection remained so ~trong in my
mind, that, for year• after, the dread of phantoms
bore in:esistible sway. This dread continued till
about my ,twenty-third year, when. the following
simple aft'air ·fully convinced me, how necessary it
. Was ·tlatW'oMgl&ly to investigate etJtry thinK •that
tended tO' supernatural agency, lest idle fear
should gain a total ascendan~y over my mind~
About this period, I bad apartmen~ in.a large
old-fashioned country mansion. From my_ bed-
·cbamber was a secret door. leading to a private
staircase, which communicated with some of the-
lower ..OOms: This door was fastened bothwithin
and without ; con~quently all fear of i~ruaiea
from that quarter _was entiHiy removed. . How-
a ever,

ever,. ~t times. I could not help ruminating on the
malpractices that mi~kt have been committed by
evil-disposed persons, through this communica-
tion ; and ." busy meddling fancy" was fertile in
conjuring up i!Jlagiuary...horrors. Every thing,
however, was quiet, and agreeable to my wishes,
for some mo~ths after my a~rival. One moon-
light night, in the month of June; I retired to· my
bed, full of thought, but slept soundly till ahou.t
one o'clock; when I awoke, and discovered, by the
he,Ip of the moon which shone full in my room, a
tall figure in white, with arms extended, at the
foot of my bed. Fear and astnnishment over-
powered me for a few seconds ; I gazed on it
with terror, and- wall afraid to move. 'At length I
•had conrage to take a &~cond peep at this disturber
of my rest, and stiU continued ni"uch alarmed, and
irresolute how to act. I hesitated whether to
speak to the .figure, or aro~ the family. The
first idea I consiJered as a d8llgerous act of hero-
ism ; the latter~ as a risk of. being laughtd at,
should i.be subject of my story not prove superna-
tural. Therefore, after taking a thit·d view of the
phantom, I mustered up all my te!'olution, jumped
o~t· of bed, and ,boldly went up- to the figure,
gra11ped it round aqd _round, .and found it incorpo-
real. I then looked at_ it again, and felt it again ;
when, reader, jud'ge of my ~touiebment-thia

large newflannel dressing-gownwbicli had beensent
ho~e to me in the course l)f the ·day, and which
bad been bung on some pegs against the wainscot
at -the foot of my bed.• One arm accidentally
crossed two or three of th~ adjoining pegs, 'and
the other was .nearly parallel by coming in con-
tact with some article of furniture which stood
near. Now the mystery was developed: this
dreadful hobgoblin, which a few minutes before I
began to think was an aerial being. or sprite, an<l
whicl, must havt> gained admissi~n either through
the key:bole, or under the door, turned out to be
my own garment, · I smiled at my groundless fears,
was pleased wit~ my resolution, returned light-
hearted to my bed, and moralized nearly the whole
of· the night on the simpllclty, of a: great pa:rt
of mankind" in being so credulo~s as to believe
every idle tale, or conceive ev~ry noise t~ be a
spectre, without first duly exami"ning into causes.
- This very trifling accident was of great senice
to me 88 I travelled onward th"rougb life. Similar I
circumstan<·es transpired. · Screams, and shades,
I encountered ; which always, upon due investi-
gation, ended in·" trift~s light as air," •; ,
Nor did the good end here. My story -circu-
lated, and put other young men upon the alert, to.
~ard apiiist similar' delu~ioos. They likewise

imparted to me their ghostly encounters, and
\ ' I
these I thought deserving pf record I always com-
mitted to writing ; and, as many of them are well
· authenticated filet~. and both instructive · and
amusing, they form a part of the volume aow
presented to the'Public. .
The other stories are selected from history, and
re~pectable publications; forming in the whole, I
hope, an antidote against a too credulous belief.io
every village 'tare, or old gossip's story.
Though -I candidly acknowledg~ to have l'f'~
ceived great pleasure in forming this ·Colle-ctici~,
I would 'by no means wish it to be imagined, that I
am sceptical in my opinions, or entirely disbelieYe
and set my face against all apparitional recOrd. ,
No; I do believe that, for certain purposes, aod;
on certain and all-wise occasions, such things
are, aod Iamie been peTmitted -by the Almighty:
but by no meens do I believe they are suffered to
appear half so- frequently as our modern ghost-
mongers manufacture them. Among the variou1
idle tales in. circulation, nothing ·is more commo~
than the prevalent opinion concerning what i11 ge-
nerally called a deat/&-watcla, and which is vulgarly
believed t~ foretel the death of some one jn the
family. " 'fhis is,'' observes a writer in tbe
Philosophical Transactions, " a ridiculo~s fancy
crept mto vulgar .heads, and employed to terrify

that no sW:h thing is .in~ded by it. It has o~
tained. the name of death-watch, by making. a
little elinkin_g noise like a watch; which having
given some disturbaoc~ to a gentlemao in his
cbaiDber, who was not to be ~&'righted wi~ luch
vulgar errors, itrtempted him·to a diligent search
after tlae true cau1e of-this noise, wlrleb. I shall
relate in his own words:
.. I bave· been, some time since, accompanied
with thi1 little noise. One evening,l sat down by
a· table from whence the noise proceeded, aod laid
ay watch upon .tile same, and perceived, to my
aclmira~ion,.tbat the sound ma~e by this invisible
automaton was louder. th~· that' of the artifif;ial
machine. Its vibratioD», would fall as regular; .
bot much quickeJ:. Upon a. atri~t exam'ina'tiol,J, it
was .found ~o ~ nothing .bJJt a little. beetle, or .spi-
der, in the wood of a bqx." Sometimes they are
found in ·the plastering of a ·wall, and ar other
times in a rotten post, or in some old chest or
trank ; and the .uoiee is· made by J;»eatiag if.f head

a dark brown, ·with spots some,rhat lighter, nd

Phil~ophical Transactions of. the Royal So-

Some people, influenced by common report,
lnlve fancied this little animal a spirit sent to ad- ·
monistnhem of their deaths ; and, to uphold the
fancy, tell you of other strange monitors altoge•
tber as ridicul0ua. Though, as.l before observed,

GHOSTS AND APPARITIONS.
THERE is no t'~lly mQr~ p~doD!inant, in _the
country at least, tban a ridiculous and superstition~
fear of ghosts and apparitiol!~. Servants, nurses,
old women, and otben of the same standard of'
wisdom, to pas!! away the tediousness of a wintt>r's
evening, piease. and terrify themselves, and the
children who compose their aud~~. with strange
relatioos ofthese things, ~ill tlJe.Y are even afraid of
.removing their eyes·from one another,·for fear of
seeing a pt~le &pectre entering the ro'?m· Fright-

strong a possession of the faculties, that ~hey
often ~main for ever fixed; and·all the argu'!lent~
of reason are unable to remove them. Henc.e it.

ESSAY, ON. GHOSTS
i11, t~at so m~ny grown-up people still keep the
ridiculous fears of their infancy. I know a ljldy,
;of very good sense in other thing~, who, if she is
left by herself after t~n o'clock at night, will
faint away at the terror of thinking some horrid
. spectre, with~yes sunk, iuea_gre cQuntenance, and
threatening aspect, is &tl\llding at her elbow. And
.~ Officer in the Guar4s, of my acquaintance, .
who has o~en, abroad,' shewn no concern in
marching up ,to fbe mo1,1th of-a ca1p1on, ~ not
courag~ enough to be in the d~rk without com-
pany. As I take t~e fear of ghosts, like all other·
prejudices, to. be imbibed in our infancy, I ~vould
recommend this advi.ce to paren\s---:to. use the
utmo~ ·care, that the DU!lds of their children are
~y.t v~tiaA!d by their ~rvants~ tales of ghoJitS, hob-
goblins, and bugb~_ats; which, thougb told to
p.l<!ase, or frigbte~1 theJD into ~.ocl, ~~eldo.m fail of
producing the :very worst ei'ecta.
There are soJJJ.e .w.bo are ghost.:mad, a~d terrify .
~emselves~ because tbe Sc.ripture has. ~entioned
t}le appearance of ghosts. 1 shall not dispute,
h\ll, by the power of God, an i~c~por~ b~_ing
may be visible to human eyes; bu.t 'tb,e.ll, B!l all-·
wise Power would ~aot have recourse to a preter-
natural eJfect but on some importllOt occuioo. ·
Therefore, my intention is only to laugh a ridi-
·culoua fear out of the WQrld, by sllewing on what

own part, I quickly found, by the lady's .looks,
that she.regarded me as a very odd kind of fellow,
witla an unfortunate aapect. For which rea&On.l
too~ my leave immediately after dinner, and with-

evik that attend fttese, superstitious follies of mUJ..:
. kind i how they subject us to imaginary atftictiOoa
and additional sorrows, that do not pt;operly eome
~ithin _our lot.. As if the uaturai calamities of
·life were not'sufficient fo~ it, we turn the most ia-
difFerent circumstances into misfb,..tlines, ~nd suffer
as much fr,om trifling accidents as. from real evils.
I have known the shooting of a star spoil a night's
rest; and ha~e seen a man in love·grow· pal~,. and
lo~e his appetite~ upon the pluckiug of a merry-
thought. A screech-owl _at midnight has alarmed
a famiiy more than a band of robbers; nay, the'
voice of a cricket hath struck more terror than
t~e roaring of a lion. Tbere is nothing so incon-
siderable, which may not. appear dr~dful.to .an ··
. imagiilation that· is filled with omens and prognos-
tics. A rusty nail, <?r .a crooked pin, shoot up
into prodigies.
·~ I remember, I was once in a mixed a~sembly:,
that was full of noise and mirth, when on a suddea
~n old wo~ unluckily observed there were tbir-
, teeD.

teea· of us in company. This remark struck a
paoic terror i.ato several who were ·present, inso-
much that one or two. of the ladies were goin~ to
leave the room : but. a friend of.mine, ·taking. no-
tice that one of our female 'companions was big
with child, affirmed there ·were. fourteeD in. the
rGOm r a,t1.d t)lat, instead of por~ending one of the
compluiy should di('. it plainly foretold one of
them ~hould be .-bom. Had not my fri.e~d found .
out this expedient to break the omen, I question·
.. not but half the women _in the company would .
have fallen s~ck that vt;ry night. .
" An old maid, that is troubled with the vapours,
produces infinite disturbances of this kind among .
her friends and neighbours. I onee knew a
maiden aunt, of a great f.tmily, who is one of
these antiquated sybils, that forebodes and 'pro-
phesies from one end. of the year to the other. ·
· She is · always. seeing apparitions;, and hearing
death-watches • and was the other day almost
frighten~d out of her wits by the great house-dog•..
. '
that howled in the stab!e at a time when she. lay
ill of the tootb-ach. Such an.extravagant cast of
' mind engeges multitudes of people not only in·
impertinent .terrors, but in .supernumerary -duti.tl~
o.f life ; and arises from tha~ fea~ and ignorance
which are natural to the ~oul of man; The hor-

A~ the following story, whieb 'is, averred to be
aotbeutic.._ and to have happened very lately, may
se"e to shew, that the stories of this kind, witb
which ·the public- ...-e,. from time to time, every
now ad then alarmed, are nothing lilore tbaa
artful impostures, it ia Pz'e11umed, it will be usefUl
11 well u eotert.ining to our ftad-ers .to giYe it
a place.
A person who kept a lodging-.boUIIe near; the
springs. at Aix-la-Chapelle, having lost his· wife,.
committed the management ·of his family to· his
-daughter, asprightly, well~made, handsome- girl;
about twenty.
There were,'•at· that time, -in the house, two
ladies and their waiting-womaa, two Dutch officers,
aud a Dominican Friar.
It happened, that, as the ytmng woman ·of the·
house was asleep one night in her bed~ she was
awakened by something that attempted to draw ·
the clothes off the bed•. She was at first frightened;.
but .thinking, upo.R recollection, that it might be,
the

the boose-dog, •~ called him by his JJame, The
clothes, however, were .still pulled from her : lind
she still iJUginiltc it was by tile dog. took up a
brtuh that l&y in her reach, and attempted k) strike
him. At that IDomeat she eaw a fta.ah of sudden
light, that tilled t&~ whole room ; upon which she
slpieked out; all was again dark ~d silent, IPld
-the clothes were Db IO.ager draWJr from her.
Ia the moming, whee she related this story.
every one treated it as a dream: and the p-1 her-
. ~ at Jut took. it tor SralliJecl, that it was no
actre tbatt an illilsioD.
The· night fbUowing,· abe was !tpiD awabbed

.she felt what she. suppOsed to be a hod again in
the ·bed : ihe again endeavoured to repress it,
and, looking towards the root of tbe bed, 88W a
large luminous cross,· on whiCh was Written dis-
tinctly, as with light, the words, " Be SlferUI" .

do well to obey the commands of the yision, aad
that no harm would cuwe uf it• . He said, he
would p~main to·see the issue; and, ip the mean

which be most devoutly joined his own.
The girl was l;l()mforted wiU. this ·spiritul u-
. sistance ; but; notwithstan'ding, took one of the
maids to be ber bedfellow the aext .night. In the
dead of the night." the flaming cross was again
vit~ible, but no attempt was made on either of the
women. They were, however, great~y terrified~;
and the servant said, she would rather leave her
place, than lie in the room again.
The Friar, the ~ext morning, took the merit of
the ~pirifa peaceable beb&v~our to himself. Tile

usistaoce. The good Friar, in the mean time,
was by no means idle at home : be performed his
devotious with great ardour; and towards evening
hestowed a plentiful libation of holy water on the
ebamber and the bed.
Tbe girl'not being ablt!·t~ persuade the ~~e·..Vant ·
to sleep with her again in the haunted room, and
being encouraged by the Friar to abide the issue,
having ~o great confidence herself in the pray~rs,
ml188ell, and sprinklings, that had been used on the
OC('.a&ion, she ventuted. once more to sleep in the
same room by herself. .

' :Seb.Jg hiulf greatly terrified at t:laese ippear-

.to the haunted room. · The Friar'at first excused

there in bed, Ae aoon as be entered, and saw the
. '
crosses, he.prO.h;ated himself oo. the ground, and
uttered maay prayers ·.w~ inc&Dtations, to which
the honest landlord most heartily said .At~~tt~. ·
The poot girl, in the mean tim-e, lay in a kiad
Qf trance; and her father, when the prayers were
ove~, mn ·down stairs for some wine, a cordial
being n~cessary to recover her: the Friar, at
tile om~ time, ordered him fD ·light and bring
with him a consecr~ted t~Jper; for hitherto they
had no light but that of tbe yiJiion, which was
&till
OOMI:NI(lAN PRIA'I.,
still atro~g eaougb -to discover every thing in. the
mom.
In a short time the old man entered with a
taper iu. his haod, and in a moment au· the lumi-
llOae appearances vanished. 'Fhe girl, soon after,
RCOvered, and gave a very sensible account of all
that ·bMI happened ; and. the landlord· and the
friar spent the rest of1tlie oigbt together.
The -Friar, bowe'ver, to shew lhe power of the ·
daemon, .and the holy virtue of the taper, removed
it several ti~Ha ·"- the <lhamber, be(ore the d·ay
broke;-and the ci:Qsses and inscriptions were·again
viaible, aod remained so' till the taper was brought
bac", .anithen vanished as 'at first.
When the suo aroae, the Friar took his lc:ave to
go to. naa.tiiiS, and ~id not return till noon. In·.
the mean time tbe two J)utch officers came ,home,
and aoon lear.nt wllat baa happened, .though the
landlord took all the pains be could to conceal
it. The reports tbey beard w~re confirmed by
tbe· pale and terrified appearance of the girl; their·
curiosity.was greatly excited, and they asked her
innumerctble questions. Her. answers, instead of
a~Aguishing, increaied it. They assured the
landlo~, they would not leave his bouse, but, on
the contrary, would afford him ~til the assistance ·
in their power. · ·
As they were you~g gentlemen of a military

to adopt the opinion o( the la{Jdlord, that the
appearanteR were s'!pernatural; but it happeaed
that, upon going into 'the room, they found the.
remainder of the taper, on the virtues of whjch the
'landlord had so largely expatiated, and immedi-
ately perCeived that it was Qnly a common candle
of a large size, which .he had brought by ~ill.~
/ ·
. in his fright, . .
This dis~;overy convinced them that there was
a fraud,' and that appea~nces that vanished-at the
. approach of UJ;lCOQsecrate~ lig..t must be prod11ced
by mere hum~n artifice•.
They tber~fore conaulted together, apd at length
agre~d, that the mass~s should be continued; that
the landlord should. not say one word. of .the can-
dle, or the suspicions it had prod~ced ; that. his
~aughter, the next night, should ~t)eep .in the
ai>artment which h~d been quitted by the ladi~;
ad that one of th~ officers should .lie in the girl's
,bed, while the other,, with the landlord, should
wait i~ the kitcbea, to see the issue.

carried into execution. · ·

called.Cotmao Deau, where, it lflts said; abe· was
frequently aeen.
There was -.a ~ding~hool of boys ~ that
town, some of_ whom were. JNP1icularly roguish,
and contrived all this walking,.from the ~~io~g
~ the etad. First, u-ey got ~ smaU rope; _aDd,
tying one ~ of it to ao old chair wllich,itood io
au upper room of the house .(.for they had found
the means to get in and out of the bouse at plea-
sure), they brought the.other end of the rope dowa
on the other'side of the bouse, in a private place,
where it could not easilybe seen ; and by this they
{lUlled ~e old chair up, aad then Jet itfall dowo
again: this made a great noise in the house, and
was heard diatiuctly by many of the ueighboura.
Then other 'boya of the IIUile gang took eue to·
eall out the old women ·in the next houses, that
·~w they might he~ the old lady playing her
pranka; and, accordi~gly, tbey w~uld allaauemble

ia the night, one of these ~nlucky boys got a
dark lanthom, which was a tliing, at that time,
the country-people did not und~rstand ; and with
this he walked about the orchard, and two or
three closes near the bouse, shewing the light in
difFerent direetions. His comrades would then
call all the eld wom~n about them to ~ it. Then:
on a sudden, the light would seem to go out, at
the boy closed up the lanthoro,. • Then be woultl

more question, but'that the Qld lady walked witla

of it; jo a word, it passed for an. apparition, aud
was generally conceived as su.cb by the neighbour·

upon the point of being made happy, by a more

passion for the young maiden, unfortunatelycrossed
their inclinations ·by demanding her in marriage.
"The allurements of a more brilliant fortune se~ ·

change. To their entreaties~ however, she was
-obliged to yieid, and sacriijced her affections by

this violence.done to her inclinations- by entering
into an engagement of interest, brought on ·her a
..
malady, which so far benumbed her faculties, that
at lengt~ abe was given over"by the. faculty, appa-
.rently died, and was accordingly ~aid ?ut for burial.
Her former lover, wh? had once before beheld
lJei in a aimilar situation, flattered himself that he
might pOssibly again iind her in a trance. This
idea not only suspended his grief, but pro~pted
him to bribe the grave-digger, by whose aid he
dug up the_ body io the night-time, and conveyed
it home. He then used evt:ry means in his power
-for recalling her to life, and was overjoyed ou diS-

It is. not easy to conceive the sarprilltf bf the
young womaq on Iter resussitation, wbea she fOund
herself in a strange house, and, as It were, io tbe
arms of her lover, wbo BOOb infor$ed her of whal

that the 6118Dcier met his wife In one of the public
walks. Tht! sight of her made so strong an im-
pression on him, tha~ for some time he imagined
it must be.her apparition; and, being fully per-

~weted the Justice, " ai I lay one Bight in my bed_

sleep, it being about twelve o'clock, on a sucJden I
was awalr,ened bY. a very strange and uncommon

As~UT the middle ofJanuary l762,· a gt>ntlemau
was sent for to the house of erne Parsons, the oti-
ciatiog parish clerk of St. Sepulchre's, in Cock ·
Lane, near West Smithfield, to be witness to th~
noises, and ,other extraordinary circbmstances, .at-
tendiDg the snppo~ presenl:e of a spirlt, that, for
two yeus preceding, had been heard in the nigtJf;
~o the great terror of the family:· This knocking
and scratching w~ alwayS beard under the· bed
where the .children lay: the. eldest was about
'twelve years of age. To iind out the cause, Mr.
~arsons,·the pa~b-clerk~ ordered the wainscot to
be taken down:· which was accordingly done :
' but tbe noise, instead 6f ceasing, as' be hoped, bC-
came more violent than. ever. The children were
afterwards removed itito the two-pair of stairs
roo.;, where the same noise followed, and was fre-
qnently"beard all night.
From these circums~nces it was apprehended
that the house was haunted; and the other child de-
clared, that slle-, some time ago, bad 'seen·the appa-

rition of a woman, surrounded, as it were, with- li.
blazing light. About two years prior to ~hich, a -
publican in the neighlx;urhood, bringing a pot o£
beer into the ho~se, about eleven o'clOck at night,
was so frightened that be 'let the beer full, upon -
seeing on t~e stairs, as' be wa11looking up, a bright
shining figure of a woman, by which he saw -
th~gb a' window into the chari~-school, and
aa.w the dial in the 1!1Chool. The tigure passed by
him, and beckoned him to follow;' but be was too
~och terrified to obey its directi.ons: be·ran home,
and, was very sick. Soon after, Mr. Parsons him-
self, having occasion to go ioro another room, saw
the same· appearance. Both -these happened .
within the space of an hour. '
l'o thro"! some light upon this very myste.
rious affair, we· shall ~gin with the .oarrame of
_Mr. Brown, 'Of A10en Comer, published January
28d,)762; the s\1bstance of whieb is as follows-
That in 1769, one Mr. K-- emplo)red an agent
to carry a letter to a young gentlewoiiUIIi of a re-
putable family ill Nmfolk, apd to bring her up to
London in a post-chaiie, if she· would be willing

to a ·lodging ne.ar the Mausioa-House: from thence
to locl~ngs bellind St. Sepulclue's. cburdl; aad, '
lastly, to a bouse in Bartlett Court, in the pariah
of Clerkenwell. Het'e, in 1760, she wu taken ill
of the small-pox; and, on or about the 31st of ,
Jaauary, her sister, who lived reputably in· Pall•
Mall, was first blade aeq~aiated with her illnes80
and place of teaidence. Being greatly cooceftJed.
thus to bear of her, she went immediately~ and
found Iter ia a fair way of doing well; next day she

aitted to sec her·sister's. corpse, the coffin beiag'

· Such is 'the account given by _Mr. Brown~ of

who attended her. several times, .an\1 who. admi-
nistered to her the last comforts of his function,
d~clares, ·that the small-pox with which she·was
eeized, was of the confluent sort ; and that the
' ~ntleman of the faculty, who ·attended her, bad
pronounced her irr-eCoverable IIOIIle days before
hud~th. · '
It was, however, tlie ghost of this persoa, that
Parsons declar~d.had taken possese_ioo ofhii girl,
· a chil~ about·t~elve years old, who lay with the
deeeased in the abseilce of her supposed husband.
when he was in the country at ·a wedding; and
then it was, that the knocking was _first beard. to
the great terror of this child, she frequently crying
out that she might not be taken away.· -Soon after,
this woman died, whose apparition was' now sup-
posed to appear to this 'same·child ;.and, in answer
to the question put to her, What w~ the. o~casioa
of the .first knocking, ~c. before she died ·J an-
swered, that it was the spirit of her. sister, the first
wife of M~. K--, who was husbatid to them
both.
Having now sufficiendy prepared the reader,
we shall proceed ill our narrative. Theptleman
already

almuiy said tO have been sent for, attended,·and
found the child in bed; and, the spirit beiag at
hand, several questions were put_ to it by the fa.
tber,. which. to avoid repetition, 'we shall relate
hereaft~r. The gentleman not caring to proao'unce
too hastily upon what appeared to him extraordi-
nary- got some friends toa:ether, among whom were
two. or three clergymen, about twenty other
persons, aad two negroes, who sat up another
Dight. -
Tbey first thoroughly ·examined the bed,·IN!d-
eloihes, &c;; aud, being satisfied that there was
no visible ap,Pearauce of deeeit,· the child with its
.uter was put into bed, which was found to shl\ke
extremely by the gentleman who had placed him-
self at the foot of it. A~o.ng others; the following
questions were asked:-·

-At four o'clock. ·
Accordingly, at this· hour the noise· removed to
the Wheat-sheaf, a public-house at the distance of
a few doors, in the bed-chamber of the landlord
and la~dlady, to the' great affright and. terror of
them both. Soch was the manner of interrogating
tbe spirit: the answer was given by knocking or
scratcbir~g,' 'An· affirDl11tive was. one lnock; a
negative, two. Displeasure was expressed by
I!Cr&tching. · ·
Nothing more occurred till the fuRowing mor~­
ia~, when the knocking began about seven o'Clock.
But, no!witbstanding some extraordinary amwers
to the several questions proposed, it was ·still a
matter of doubt whether the whole was n~t a piece
of imposition; and it was resolved to remove the
child elsewhere. .Accordingly, instead ofits being
carried home, itwas conveyed to a house in Cr~wn-:
and-Cashion Court, at the upper end of'Cow Lane,
.near Smithfield, where t1vo clergyoien, several gen-
tlemen; aad some ladies, assembled in the evening.

triek of her's, t)le child was uneasy, and' cr~d:
on which the knocking was ~eard louder, and much
faster than before; ·but DO answer could be ob-
'tained. to any question while that gentleman sbud
·· in the room,
'After be was· gone, the ·~ise ceasid: ud no-
·thing was heard till a little after twell':e o'clock,
whe!l the child ~ sei-ed w~th a trembli~g and
shive.ring ; in which manner she had always been
·affect~~. on the departure as well as the approach
of .the ghost. Upon thilb one of the company·
asked, whether it would return again,.and at what
time1 Answer: was made in the usual manner by
knoeks, that it would return agail~ before seven in
the morning ; .and then a noise, like the. flutte~g .
of wings, was Jiell!d; after which all was quiet till
' bet.Veen six and seven on Friday morning, ':fhen
the knocking began again.
A little before seven, two clergymea came, when
the fluttering noise was -:epeated, which in this
strange affair was considerecl as'11 mark of the spi-
rit's being pleast:d.- ·Then several qfl~tions', par-
ticularly one, by a gentlewo.man, who was 3D ac-
q~ntan~e of the deceased, who came out o( me~
curiosity', and had been to see her some time
before

befor~ she died: the_ question wu, How many days
it was· before her death,. that this gentlewoman
rame to see her1 The answer given was three
knocks, signifying .three daya; which waa exactly
right. Another -qtrea~on·Willi, Whether some of
the then company had not a· relation that had
been buried in the _same vault where she lay 1 To
whic.h ~t replied by one knock, Yes. They asked,'
severally,-if it was their. relation'l To all of which,
e~cept the- last, she answe~ by two knocks,
meailing No; but to the last person she gave one
knock,'w'hich was-right. These two circumstances'
greatly alarmed all the company.
Near twenty persons sat up in the room: but it
was not till about six. o'clock in the morning that
the first ala~ was given, which coming spontane-
ously, aa well as suddenly, a good deal struck tlie
imagination of the auditors. The scratchea were
_compared to tbat·ofa cat_upon a cane chair. Tlae
child now appeared to be in a soun"d sleep, and
nothing further could be obtained. It had been
observed, in conversation,· by a per~oo who ex-
pressed himself pretty warmly Qll the subject, that
the whole was an imposture, ud more to the sam~
purpose: whichgave rise to some sharp altercation .
among the company-some believing, and others ·
disbelieving the reality of the apparition. This dis-
puk was no sooner begun, than the spirit was gone~

About seven o'clock the girl seemed to awal:e
in a violent fit of.cryiag and tean. Upon being
asked the ocCIIIIiop, and assured that nothing of
balm should happen to her, she declared that her
tears were the effect of her imagination Itt what
would beeome of her daddy, who oiust needs be.
JIUined aDd uodone, if this matter should be sup-
posed to be an imposture. She was told, that the

On the Stmday night fOllowing, the girl lay at a

A«Mdingly, when St. Sepnldrre's -dock struck·
se'ftll, on Monday morning, this' invisible agent
bocked Oe same' number of times. Some few
questi0118 were asked at this meeting, much to the _
same purport as those above inserted;and answered
ia -the s~e manner. Every person was· put out
pi the room, who could be supposed to have tbe-
leut eonnexion with the girl : her hanCJs w~re •
laid ov-er tbe bed-clothes, and the bed narrowly
looked 'under, &e. but n~ diseo•ery was made.
On· the ni:ht of the 1st of' February, many gen-
demeu, eminent for their ~nk and cliaracter,~ were,
by the invitation of the Rever~nd Mr. Aldrich, o( .
Clerkenwell, as~bled at his house, for the exa-
. miuation of the noises supposed ·to be made by a
departed spirit for the detection ~f some enormoult
crime.
About ten at night, the gen'tlemen "met in the
cbflmber, in which the girl supposed to be dis-
turbed by a spirit bad, wfth proper caution, been
pot· to bed by several ladies. _ They sat with her
rather more than an hour ; and, bearing nothing,
went <knvn stairs, when they interrogated the father
of the girl, who denied, in_ the strongest terms, any
knowledge or belief of fraud.
·The supposed ~pirit had. before publicly pro-
m_ised, by an affirmative knock, -that it,wonld at-
tend one of the gentlemen into the null under the
G 2 church
136 COCJt-L.tNB GHOST.
church of St: Johu; Clerkeawell, where tbe body
was deposited ; and give a token of her presence
tllere, by a knock upon her coffin:· it was,. theR-
fore, 'determined to make th~ trial of the- existence
or veracity of the supposed spirit.
While they were inquiring aqd deliberating,
' they were summoned into the girl's chamber by
the ladies.who ·remained near her bed, and -who
heard lmoeks and scratches. When the gentle-
men entered, the girl dec!ared .that sht> felt the
Jpirit like a mouse open her back, mel was required
to hold her hands out of bed. From that time,
tbou~h the spirit was very·solemnly required to
• ~anifest _its existence, by appearance, by impres-
sioD; oil the hand or body of any person preseat.
by scratches, knocks, or any·. other agency, DO
evidence of any preternatural power was exhibited.
The spirit was then very seriously advertised,
that the person to whom the promise was made, of
strikin; the coffin, was ~eo about to visit the
vault, and that the performance of the promise
.was then claimed. The ~mpany, at one o'clock,
went into the church;· and that~ gentleman, to
whqm the promise wai made,_ went,. with O..e
·more, into the •ault•. The spirit'was very soh~mnly .
required to perform its_pro~ise, but nothing more
than 8i!ence ensued : the person supposed to he
·.,aceoaed by the spirit then went dowu, with several
others,

•tberi, but no elect was perceived. · Upo~ their
retum, they e'llimined the _girl, but could draw no
ebafessioo from her. Between two and three,
s~e desired, aad was permitted, to go b.ome with.
her father.
No do•bt now remained of the fallacy of this
·· spirit. ·It"'as supposed that the girl was practised
.in _the art of ventriloquism:. an •rt better known·
11ow than formerly ; but it was soon after disco-
..-ered that there was not so much inpulty in the
~-· . .
A bed was slnng like·a ~mrpock, in the mid-
. die of a room, at a gentleman's ·house, where
t'he gfrl wu sent. The servants were ordered to
watch her narrowly ; and, about a quarter of an
hour before bed-time; sh~·was observed to cou.~eai·
something under _her clothes•. Information of this
being giren to"the gentlemen attending, they were
of opinion, that a connivance at the beginning of
the scene wo11ld be the ~ost likely means of le,ad-
iog them to a.full disco~ery of the fact. In the
morning, about 'Six o'clock, the knockings came,
· -and ~nswered to . questio.;s- ·as usual, bnt in so
d~erent a sound, that it was very apparent this
method of operating was. a ttesb contrivance.
When the kno"ckings, wliicb co~tinued ·for near ·
half aJi hour, were- over, shf' was several times

ordered to take her o..i ~f bed, a piece of beard

Soon· after, ·a trial came on b~J'e Lord Mans-

a special jury, on an indictment against Riclaard

It happened tJuit he wu abroad at a friead'a
house later thlln ordioary one night ; but, it
. being moon-light, and baviog a servant with llim',
be seemed· to be easy, and was observed to be
-cheerful, and even merry, with a great deai more
· of good-humour than had been observed in him
fur some time before.
He knew his way perfectly well, for it was
within three mile:t of the town where he lived, and
be was very well mounted : but, though the moon·
\vas up, an acdde.nt, which a little disordered him,
was, that a very thick black cloud appeared · to
.bim to oome suddenly over his head, which made
it very dark; and, to add to his discomfort, it
began to raio violently. •
Upon this he resolved to ride for it, baviog not
aboy.e two miles to 'the town; so, clappiug spun
tO his -
horse, hf gallope(t B\~Y· His. man (whose •
name was ~ertai11), not be~g iJo well mounted, was
a considerable way behind. The d~rlmess of the
nig~t, and the .l'llio together; put him a little out
of b:umour,and made him ride rather harder than
his .usual P!lce.
_ lo his -
way home, there was a small river for him
to pallli; .but there was a good bridge over it, well
walled oa both sides, so that there_ waa no more-
danger than in aoy other place. .!I'he gentleman
kept on .at a good pace.. and was ratlter more than
o 4 half
·140 ' HYPOCHONDJUAC SE~T...EVAN,
half over the bridge, when his horse stopped all
on a sudden, and would not go on. He saw nO-
thing ~t first, an,d was therefore not much discom-
posed at .it, but spurred his h~tse to go forward.
The horse then went two or: three 'Steps ; then
stopped again, snorted, ·and started; then at-
tempted to turn short bl\ck. The ·gentleman, in
endeavouring 'to see what: frightened ·the horse,
· saw two bro,d staring eyes looking him full i~ the
face. , .
.He was:now most lrear~ily frightened ; but, .by
this time, he beam his man Jetvais ~~ming up.
When he came n~ar, the._first thing he heard his
master say, was, •r ·Bless. me, it is the devil!" at
which exclamation the man ·\vas almost as much
frightened as his master; However, the gentleman,
a little encouraged to hear 'his mao so near· him,
pressed· bill botse ·once more to go·forward, and
calJed aloud to his servant to follow; but J,ervais,
being much fnghtened, mad~ no baste.· At le~gtb,
with great difficulty, 'he got over the bridge, llnd
passed by the creature with the . br.oad starillg
-eyes, which he positively affirmed was the .devil.
· Thougb·Jervais was· near enougb, yet, fearing
his master would order 'him to go before, he kept .
as far oW as he possibly could. Wheu his master
ealled, he· anllwered, bot proceeded very ·slowly,
till he observed his in..ter had gone past : when,

what .it was his. master's. hot:Se snorted· at,,which
tile reader wiJJ..1M! made acquainted with pre-
seotly. ·
. The gentleman, having now past the di~culty, ·
~lloped home as fast as possible, and got into the
houSe long before J~rvais could get up with him.
As soon as be alighted,.he swooned away, such ilD
e&"ect the fright had on him ; 1Uld with much
difficulty they brought him to hilliself. When be
recovered, b~ told the family a{ormal story, tbat
at such a bridge he met with the devil, who was
staniling at the ,ieft-hand comer of the wall,_and
stared him rull in the face; and be so fully 'expa-
tiated on· -this su~ject, that all believed, atJeast,
be bitt"met with an apparition. .
Je!"3is. soon after came home, and went directly
.to the stable to take care of the horses; where he
toldhis story in fbe following maniier to his feltow-
setvant;: " Finding," say$ be, "-that my master Was
in danger .of being thro:wn over. the bridge, .I fear-
lessly rode nea~ him; when,·to my very .greal; sur-

young and ~kittish) was frightened at ~n ass, which
stood grazing near the corner of the wall." " Are

wing was prepared for his acco~ation. .
The family,_ and_ their young ~esb, spent the
day very agreeabl)'; and, after supper, they sat
round a_ comfortable'large fi~;e, and diverted them-

119me of the leader and pathetic kind; but the lat-
ter 1Jere,for the 01011t part, of the melancholy cast,
particularly those· which r~lated ib preternatural
occurrences. The soc~ party separated at half
past tweiYe o'clock; and Bubaroase retired to his
cbainber. It was a handsome .room on the first

t~ two little closets, one on the right that over- -
looked a farm-yard, and another more to the left
that presented a view through the window of a
large romantic wood ; the third door- was that by
'l!Vhicb be entered his room~ after tn(versing a_loog

·morning, and looked o_ut of the window to eqjoy
the prospect for a gr~t while.
. As he entered this apartment, wi1h his mind
full of the diversion just left, he set his candle
down upon the table, and looked about him.
There_was an excellent fire in the chimney, with
an iron grating before it, to preve~t aceidenls; a
large elbow-chair sto~d near it; and, not being at
all sleepy, he sat. down reflecting ·on t~ amuse-

and astonishment at the- roaupectee apparition,
sunk down ·cortvullitl• ir;a his chajr.
The phantom was armed de c11p ea' pied, and
clad in a black garment. On his crest a black
plume waved majestically; and, instead of a glov;e ·
or any other so~:t of lady's favour, he wore a blood-

hand ; but a gloomy shield, made of ~e feJthers of
some kind of bird, was ·Cast over eacla shoulder.
He was booted and spurred; and, looking upon
Barbarosse with ardent eyes, raised his feathery
arms, and struck them vehemeatly against his
sides, .making at the lame time the most vociferoua

- The cburch belonging to the_college fronted the

HAMMERSMITH GHOST.
IN the year1804, the inhabitants ofHammel'lllllith
were much alarmed by a nocturnal atppearaoce;
which, for a considerable time, eluded ·d~tection
or discovery. In the course of tbis uofortuoabr
affair, two innocent persons met with an untimely
death ; and ~~ this transaetion engaged the atten-
tion of the public ~ a high degr~e, we shall fully
relate the particulars of it. _
An unknoWn person made ii his. diversion to
alarm theiahabitmts, inJaauary 1804, byas~uming
the figure of a speetre. This s~ gh~t has cer-
tainly much to 110swer .for. One ~r woman,
who. was ,far ad•anced_ in be~ pregoaocy of a. se-
~ond child, was. so much shocked, that she took
to· her bed, and survived only two days. She had
been- crossing ·near. the church-yard· ab«)ut ten
o'clock at _
night, when she bebel.d something, as·
she described, rise fro~ the tomb-stones. The
figure was .very tall, and .very wbi_te I .She at-
tempted t~ run, but the supposed gb,ost soon over-
. took her..' and, pressing her·in his a.:.O., she fainted;
in which situation •.he remamed some hours, till

cliscoYered by the Jleishboun, who kindly led bel!
home, whm she took to her bed; from which, alas I
she neTer I'OIIe. A 'ft!goner belongios: to 'Mr.
Ruuell was also .o alarmed, ~bile dri'ring a team
·of eis:ht hones, wbieh bad sixteelr ~r:a at
the time, tbat be took to his heels, and left the
,..,goa, hones, and ·passeagen, in the greatat
danger. Neither man, woman, or child;- would
pass that way for some time; and the report was. . f
· that it was the apparition of a mau who had cut his
throat in that neighbourhood a~ve a year before.
Several lay in wait difFerent nights for the ghost;
but there were so mauy bye-lanes, ~d p&~ lead-
ing to Hammenmith, that he was always sure of
being in that whiel! .was unguai-ded, .~d every
nipt ·played ·oft' his tricks, to lhe terror of tli~
puseugen.
One Francis Smith, doubtless inceilsed at the
unknown.penon who was in the habit of assuming
the supernatural character, and thus frightening
the superstitious inhabitantsof the Tillage, rashly
determined on wateh~ng for, ·and ~hooting the
ghost; when, unfortunately, in Black-Lion Lane, he
shot a poor 'inaoeent Dian, -Thomas Millwood, a
bricklayer,. ":ho was in a '!bite dress,· the usual
"habiliment ofhis occupation. This rash act, haT-'

AT a· towa in the we1t of Epgland, was held &'
cbab of twenty-four persons. which aBae~Dbled ooce
a week, to driok punch. smoke tobacco, aud &alk
politics. Like Ru~ens's Academy at Antwerp, eaek
member had. hie peculiar chair. and the pn!sitieaf~
was more exalted than tlie rest. One of the raea-
bers had been in.·a dyillg st:afe for aome ·time ;

of course;. his chair, while he was absent, reeaiaed
vacant.
The club bein~ met on their usual night, inqui-
ries were naturally mad~·after their asSQciate; As
he lived in the adjoining bouse, a particular friend
went bimseJf to"inquire for him,.and returned with'
the dis~al tidings, that he could not possibly sur-
vive the, night. This threw a gloom on the COm·
pany, and all efforts to turn the oonversatiou from
the sad subjectbefote them were ineft'ectuat.
· A'bout midnight (the time, by long prescription,
appropriated for the walking of spectres), the door
opened ; and .the form, iu white, .of the dying, or
rather of the dead man,' Walked into the room.
and took bi.s seat iu the ac~usto~J~e'd ~hair: ·there
' he ren1ained in·silence, imd in silence was he gaJ!ed
at. .The apparition continued a sufficient time in
the chair to·convince all present of the reality of
the vision: 'at length, be arose, and stalked towards
the door, which be opened as if living:_went out,
and then shut the door .after him. After' a long
pause, some one; a:t last, bad the reSGiution to say,
" If only one of us bad seen this, be would not
have been believed; but it is impossible that so
many persons can be. deceived."
The oompany, by dEgrees, recovered their
speec~; and the l,Vbole conversation, as may be
imagined, was upoil the .dreadful object which bad

e.p.d their at&ention. They broke up, aud went
hCHUe. In the morning, inquiry was made after
their 11ick friend ; it was answered by an acc~uut
of his death, which happened nearly at the time of .
his.. appe.aring in the club. There could be little
doubt before,. butnQw.nothing could be more cer-
1ain, than the reality oftbe apPll;rition, wliich bad
been seen by so.maoy persons together, ,
It is need.ess to say, that such a story spreaf,i
over the couutry, aud found credit, .even from infi-
dels; for,. io this c.&se, all re~sooing became super-.
1luous, when op.,osed to a plain fact, attested by
three-and-twenty witnesses. To assert the doc-
tri~e of the fixed laws ·of nature, was ridiculous, ·•
when th;re were so many people of credit to prove .
tha~ they.mjgb~ be oofixed.· ' Years rolled oo; the
story cea~d to ~ngage attention, and it was for-
gotten, . unles~ when occasionally produced to
silence an uubeliever,' .·
One of the club was an apothecary. In the
course of his practice, he was called to an old wo-
man, whose profession was attending on sick per-
sons. She told him, that she could leave the world
with a quiet conscience, but for one thin! which lay
~n her mind. " Do not you -remember. Mr.--...

THE

The figure then approaphing· his l?ed, he had

were codlmonly.introduced among us by means of
the pantomimes aod novela of the day,· a gentlemaa
of a philosophical turn of mind, who was hardy
enough to deny· the existence of any thing super~
natural, flappeoed to pay a visit at an old bquse in
Gloucestersbire, whose u'iifortunate owner had
ju&t become a bankrupt, with. a view to oi'er such
assistance and consolation aa he could beatow :
·when, ill one.rainy dull evening in the monUJ of
March, the family being· seated by the kitchen
.fire-eide, the convenation tumed on supematnral
appearances. The p'bilosopher was· endeavouring
to convince his auditors of the folly and absurdity
of such opinions, with rather ao unbecoming levity,
when the wife left the party and went up stains;

'itad never returned. It was next affirmed, tha.t a
tradesman, paasi.ng the church-yard about twelve
• midnight, bad seen four men catty a deati
.e~orpse into that t:emetery: ·
These three facts being joined together, seemed
perfectly to agree, and to confirm one another;

committed. The- relations of the ger!tleman
thought they were· called upon. to make inquiry
into the truth of these allegations~ they accord-

ther aoy of them bad lately been dur, Gr bad the
appearance of containing more than one coffin.

summoned to appear before a. meeting of the
justices t>f the peace. · Upon examination, he de-

, I '
the: court to another p-erson, from whom he had
received ·his information; This petson was exa- '
mined;·and the result was the _same as the former.
In short, one person had )Jeard it from ·another,
who h~ad received it from a-third,. who hl!d heard
it from a fourth ; 'bu~ it had received a little eui-

UNFORTUNATE PRIEST,
AND
DEAD BODY. .
IN a provin~e of Pr~ssia, a man being dead, wa~
carried,. as is CU»tomary, i~to the church the
evening previous to the day of his interment. It
is usual· to place the corpse in an open coffin ; aDd
a priest, attended only by a boy· of the choir, 're-
mains all night praying by the side of the dead
body, and on the following day the friends of the
dece8$!d come to close up the coffin, and inter the
corpse~ Qn t~s occasion, after the e~ening service '
had been performed, every one retired from the
church: and the priest, with the young chorister,
'wjthdrew to supper; but soon returned, and the
former commenced the usual prayers. , What was
his astonishment,_ when be beheld the dead body·
rise from the coffin, and advance towards him.
Terrified in_the extreme, the priest flew to the
foot; and, conjuring the corpse to return· to its
proper station, showered holy water on him in
abundance. But the o~stinate and evil-minded
spirit, disregarding tb~ power of holy water,

ground, and. soon, by repeated blows, left him
extended, without life, on the pavement. Having
committed this act of barbarity, he ~ppeared to
return quietl.Y to his coffin. On the, following
morning, the pe~oas who came to prepare for the
funeral, found the priest murdered, and the corpse,
as before, in the coffin. Nothing could throw any
light on this extraordinary event but the testimony
of the boy, who had concealed himself on the first
movement of the dead body, and who persisted
in declaring, that he saw from hi~ hiding-place 'the
priest killed by the corpse: Conjecture, and en-
deavours to discover the truth; were alike 'vain,
tormenting, and fruitless. Many resources .were
tried; for it was not every one 'that submitted
themselves to the belief of a dead body rising to
kill a priest, and then quietly resigning itself to
.the plac·e of its consignment. Many ye-an after-
wards, a malefactor, condemned to'death for va-
rious crime,. and b~:ought to the torture, confessed,
that havin~ (for some unknown reason) conceived
an implacable hatred against the priest in question,
'he had formed the design of thus avenging him-
self. · Hllving found means to remain in the church,
he seized the moment of the priesfs retiring to
supper, withdrew the dead body from the coffin,
aad placed himself in its stead, in the shroud·and
other

other appurtenances. After executing the murder
of the priest, he returned the corpse to its place,
and got unperceived out of the church, when the
friends of the deceaSed came in the morniug to
attend the funeral.

REBECCA was the f~irest maid
Tbat on the Danube's borders play'd;
And many a hand11ome nobleman
For her in tilt and tourney ran:

Rebecca heard the gossips say,
•• Alone, from dusk till midrrigbt, stay

Upon the Vigil of ~t. Mark;
And, lovely maiden, you shall see

Stepp'd to St. Stephen's.church to see
What youth her husband was to be.
Rebecca heard the screech-owl cry,
AJ!d saw the black-bat round her fty;
She sat till, wild with fear at last,
Her blood grew cold, her pulse bea~ fast;
And yet, rash maid, she stopp'd to see
What youth her hu_sband was to be.
Rebecca heard the. DJidnight chime ..
Ring out the yawning peal of time,
Whe~ shrouded Paul, unlucky knave!'
Rose, like a.spectre from the grave,
And cried-" Fair.maidm, COfiU wit/& me,
For I your_ bridegrootn 11m to be.''
Rebecca turned her head aside,
Sent forth a horrid shriek--and died ;
While Paul confess'd himself in vain;
Rebecca never spoke again•.
Ah! little, hapless girl, did she
Think Deat/& her bridegroom was to be.

THE
FLOA'llNG· WONDER,
OR
FEMALE SPECTRE.
TuE bridge over the river Usk, near Caerleon, in
in Wales, is formed 9f wood, and very curiously'
constructed, the tide ris~g occasionally to the al·
mo~t incr!ldible height of fifty or sixty feet. 'fhe
bo~rd~ which compose the flooring of thi~ bridge
being designedly loose, in order to float with the
tide, when it exceeds a certain height, are pre.
;vented (rom escaping only by little pegs at the end
of them ; which mede of fast~ning does not afford
~ ':ery safe footing for the ,traveller, !lDd some
awkward accidents have been known to arise from
this <;ause. The following singular a~venture oc·
curred about twenty years. since to a female of the
neighbourhood, as she was passing it at night.
14 The
188 ·FLQATING WONDER.
Tb~ heroine in question .was a Mrs. Willialbs,
who bad been te spend a cheerful evening at a
neighbour's house on the eastero side.of the river,
ad was'returning home ,t a decent hour. The
aight being extremely dark, she hall. provided her-
self with a lanthom ud candle, by the assistance o£
whi~h she found her way to the bridge, and had
already. passed part of the daugerou~ structure.
when she unfortunately trod on a plank that had
by some accident lost the tenons originally fi1ed to
•the ends of it; and bad slipped from its proper
situation ; the fuithless board yielded to the .weight
df the good lady, who was rather corpulent, and
carried her through. the flooring, with her candle
and lanthorn, into the river. Fortunatel)·, at the
moment of falling, she was standing in suclt a po-
sition, as ga'·e ber a seat on the plank similar to
that of a horseman on his nag. It may be easily
imagined, that Mrs. Williams must have betoo
dreadfully alarmed at this ~hange ohituation, as
well as the difference of element. Blessed, how-
ever, with great presence of mind, and a patient
endurance of evil, the good lady was not over-
whelmed by her &n; but steadily maintained her
seat on the board ; taking care, at the same time,
to preserve her candle lighted, rightly supposing
it would serve as ll guide to &!JY one who might
'he able or willing to assist her. Thus bestriding
th~
FL()ATING WONDER. 189
. I
the plank, our heroine was hurried down the river
towards Newport, the bridge of which, she trusted,
would stop her progress. or that she might alarUl
the inhabitants with her cries. In ~oth her hopes,
however, she was disappointed: the rapidity of a
spring tide sent her through the arch with the ve-
locitY of an arrow discharged from a bow, and the
good people of the town bad long been wrapped
in slumber. 'fbus situated, her prospect became
each ~oment more. desperate; her candle was
nearly extinguished! and every limb so benumbed
with cold, that she had ~he greatest difficulty in
keeping ker ssddle. Already she had reached the
mouth of the Usk, and was ori the point of encoun-
tering the turbulent waves of the British Channel,
when the master of a fishing-boat, who was re~urn­
ing from his nightly toils, discovered ·the gleaming
of her iaper, and hearing her calls for assis~ance,
though he at first thought her a witch, yet ven-
tured to approach thi~ floating wonder, and ~ap­
pily succ~eded in rescuing Mrs. Williams from a
watery grave, and bringing her in safety Jo the
shore in his boat.
Thus was the life of a fellow-creature preserved
by apoor"fisherman's courage, in not being daunted
by what lie at first _conceiv"ed a mysterious· light
proceeding from some sprite or hobgoblin; but,
from duly examining jnto causes, proved himself
both a hero and friend.

THB following singular adventurf! is related by a
ailitary captain.
" I was coming home one night on horseback,
from a visit J:· had been making to a number of the
neighbouring villages, where I had quartered my
recruits. It happened there l,lad fallea a deal of
rain that day, since noon, and during all the even-
'ing, which had broken up the roads, and it was
rain.ing still with equal violence; but, being forced-
to join my company next morning, I set out, pro-
vided with a· lantlrorn; ·having to pass a strait
defile between two mountains. I had cleared it, ·
'When a gn~t of wind took off my-hat, and carried
it so far, that I despaired of getting it again, and
therefore gave the matter up. By gr~at good for-
tune, I had with me,my red cloak. I covered my
li~ad and shoulders with it, leaving nothing but
a little hole·to see my way, and bre!Jthe through;
and, for fear the wind should take a· fancy to my
cloak, as well as my hat, 1 passed my right arm
round my body to secure it: so that, riding on in

wbieh I held in my right hand, was under ~y left:

I met three travellers, who no _aooner saw me tha~
they ran away as fast ~ 'possible. For my part, I
went on upon the gallop; and when I came into the
town, alighted at m inn; where I desig~ed to rest
myselfa little. Soon after,,w)lo should ~oter, but
my three poltroons, as pale as d~ath itself. They
told the landlord and his people, trembling as ~hey
spoke, that in the ro~d they had encountered a
great figure of a man.all over ·blood,.whose head
was like a ftaril.e of fire, and to increase the won-
der, placed beneath his shoulder. H~ was mounted
on .a dreadful horse, said they, quite black behind,
and grey before ; w.hich, ootwiths!anding it was
lame, he spurred and whipped rigbt up the moun-
tain with extraordinary swiftness. Here they . ,'
ended their relation. They had taken care to
!!pread the alarm as ·they were flying from this
wondrous apparition, and the people had come
with them to the ion in 'such a drove, that up-
~ards of an hundred were all squeezed together,
opening both their mouths and ears at tbi~:~ tre·
mendous story. To 1.11ake up in some sort for my
dismal journey, I resolved to laugh a little, and be
merry at their cost, intending to cure them of such
friiht, by shewing them their folly in the present
instance. ·

again, behind .the inn; and went round about 'till I
had rode the distance of a. niile or thereabouts ;
when, turning, I· disposed' of my accoutrements,
that is to say, my croak and lantborn, as before,
and on I came upon a gal.lop tow~rds the inn.

figure he had seen me by his kitchen fire. It was
not without real difficulty, we could bring the
simple people who had. crowded in for safety from

THE following story is extracted from a letter I
l'ecei.ved, some time since, from a friend,· on the
subject of apparitions.
• cc Returning, one e~ening in the summer, te my
apartments, at a short distance from town, I was
invited by my landlady, a brisk "young widow, to
partake of un petit •ouper, as she termed it. The
invitatiqn, of course, I accepted; and, after a
pleasant repast; the cloth being removed, various
conversation ensued, and the tetminating subject
was ghosts and hobgoblins. After my attention
bad been greatly excited by many dreadful re-
citals, I thought I perc"eived something black
glide swiftly by my feet. My back at that time
being towards the door, I instantly turned round;
,
and, perceiving the same to be shut, I fancied my .
fear to be only a chimrera arising fro~ the subject
we had ~een convers-ing· on. I therefore reple-
nished my glass;. and the su~ject of spectres was
again renewed. In the midst of the disci)Urse,
when I was all attenti~n to some dreadful tale, I
felt

felt something gently brush the bottom of my
chair; when, on looking down, I beheld the most
hideous· black figure imagination can conceive.
It was a monster on all fours, witla cJoven feet,
horns on its head, and a long tail trailing after it
'as it moved along. My terror, I wil~ acknowledge,
was ao great, that I instantly jum~d up as high as
-th~ table, and loudly vociferated, • Lord have
mercy upon me! what is it 1' My friendly hostess
now begged me to sit down and be a little calm,
and she would explain to me the cause of my
alarm. The figure having again disappeared, the
lady of the ceremonies thus addressed me-• I
beg your pardon, Sir, for the fright I have thus
occ~ioned you. It- is only a little joke I have
been playing off, merely to see whether you were

of mine having been to a -masqued· ball in a
do~ino, I prepa~ed the stratagem, by IJ!akiog a
head-piece to the dress, with horns, falae legs,
clov~n feet, and a tail. I then instructed my ser-
vant, who was by agreement to be in the adjoining
room~ on ijearing ·a certain part of my storjr, to
open the door as sot'tly as possible, and to make
her mtre -in this habiliment. This she attempted
before the plot wu sufficiently ripe, when you
turned round..towards tht". door, and she retreated•

THE
SPECTRE OF THE BROKEN.
\
THE following observations on that singular pbe-
Domenon called.tbe Spectre of tM Broken. in Ger-
many, ilrrelated by Monsieur J. L. Jordali, in the
following words.
·~ In the cou111e of my repeated tours through
the Harz (mOWttains in Germany), I ascended the '
Broken twelve times ; but I had the good fortune
only twiee (both times about Whitsunti~) to see
tbat atmospheric phenomenon called ' the Spectre
of the Broken, which appears to me so worthy of.
particular attention, as it mnst. ao deuw, ·be' ob-
served on other high mountains, wbicli have a
situation favourable for producing it. -The fust
time I was deceived· by this eJ.traordina.ry J;theoo-
menon, I bad clalllbered up to the summit of the
Broken very early in the morning, in order to wait
for the inexprestibly beautiful view of the &JlD
rising in the east. The laeaveos were already
streaked
20.f SP:£CTRE OP THE BROK.EN.
streaked ~ith red; the sun' was just appearing
above the horizon in full m~esty; and the moat
perfect 1erenity prevailed throughout the· sur-
rounding coootry; when the other Harz moun-
tains in the aouth-west, towards the Worm moun-
tains, &e. lying under the Broken, began · to
.be covered by thick clouds. Ascending at that
moment the granite rocks called the Tempelskan-
zel, there appeared before me, though at a great
distance, towards the Worm mountains and the
Aucbtertnansbobe, the gigantic· figure of a man,
as if standing on a large pedestal. But scarcely
had I dis_covered it~ wb~n it began to disappear;
the clou(,ls sunk down apeedily, and expanded;
and I saw the phenomenon no m.ore. 'ffte. se-
cond time, however, I saw-this spectre somewhat
more distinctly, 'a little below the summit of the
Broken, 1md. near the .Ueinnicbsbobe, as I wa•
looking at the sun-rising, about four o'clock•in the
.morning. The weather was ~tber tempestuous;
the sky towards the level country was pretty clear;
but the Harz mountains bad attracted several
thick clouds which bad been hovering round them,
and which, beginning on· the Broken, co¢ined the
prospect. -In these douds, soon after the rising
of the sun, I lj&W my own shadow, of a molilstrou~
size, move itself, for a couple o_f seconds, in the
clouds; and the phenomenon disappeared. It is
·impossihle
SPECTRE OP THE BROKEN. 20&
impossible to see this phel)omenon, ex<:eP,t when
the sun is at such an altitude as to throw his rays
upon the bod{in an horizontal direction; for if
he is higher, the shadow is thro.wn rather qnder
the body than before it.
" In the month of September, last year, as-I was
making a tour through the Harz with a very agree-
able party, and ascended the Broken, I fouad an
excellent account and explanation of this pheno-
menon~ as a~en by'~· Haue on the 23d of May
1797, in his diary of an excur~ion to that moun-
tain ; I shall therefore take the liberty of tran-
scribing it. . .
• After having been here for the thirtieth time,'
says M. Haue; •and,_ besides other objects ofmy at-
tention, haviDg procu~d information respecting the
above-mentioned atmospheric phooomenon, l was
at lt?Igth so fortunate as to have the pleasure of
seeing it.; and, perhaps, my description may aft"or~
satisfaction to others who visit _the Bro~ei:t through
c;uriosity. The sun rose about four o'clock; and,
the at~osphere being ·quite serene towards the
east, his rays could pass without any ob~truction
over the Heinnicbs~e. In the. south-west, ·how-
ever, towards the Auchtermaunsbohe, a brisk west
wind carried before it their transparent vapours,
which were not yet condens~d into thick heavy
clouds. Abeut a qua~ter past four I went to-

wards the inu, and looked round to see whether
the atmosphere would permit me to have a free
prospect to the south-west; when I ob&e(Ved, at a
very great distance, towards the A~~ehtermaun­
sbobe, a human figure, of a monstrous size. A
violent gust of win<J having aimos~ carried away
my hat, I clapped my ha~d to. it by moving my
arm· towards my heRd,. and the colossal figure did
the same. T~e pleasure which I felt on this dis-
covery can.bardly be described; for I had already
walked many a weary step in·the bop~ of seeing
this shadowy image, withou~ being able to satisfy
my curiosity. I immediately made another move-
ment by bending my body, and the colossal figure
before me repeated it. I was desirous of doing
tbe same thing once more; but my colossus had
vanished. I remained in the same position, wait-·
iug to see whether it would return i and, in afew
minutes, it again made its appearance in the Auclr
termaunshohe. I paid my respects to it a second
ti~e, and it. did UJe same to me. · I then called
the landlor,d ·of the B_roken ;, and, ha\'ing both
taken the same position which I h~d taken alon~,
we looked.towards the AuchtermaunshQhe, but saw
nothing. We bad not,,however, stooa long, when
hyo such colossal figures were formed over the
above eminence, whic,h repeated our compliment,
bybending their bodie~ as we did ; after whtch they
vanished.

..Dished. We retained our position, kept our_
eyes .fi_xed upon the same spot; and, in a· little
time, the two figures" again stood before us, and
:were joined by a third. Every move_ment that we
made by bending our bodies, these figures ~mi­
tated; but with this differt'nce, that the pheno-
menon was sometimes weak and faint, sometimes
strong and well-defined.- Having thus bad an o~
portunity of discovering the .whole .secret of this_
phenomenon, I can give the following information
to such of my readers as may be_desirous of seeing
it themselves. When the rising sun (and, accord-
ing to analogy, the case will be-the same at the
aetting sun) throws his rays over"the Broken upon
the body of a man standing opposite to fine light
clouds floating around or hovering past biQJ, he
needs only fix his eye stedfastly upon them, and
in all p~bability he will see the singular spectacle
of his own shadow extending _to the length qf five
,or six hundred feet, at tlie distance of about two
miles ft.o~ him. This is _one of the most agree-
able phenomena I have evet had an opportunity
of remarking on the great obse"ations of Ger-
many.'-'' · '

SIR HUGH .ACKLAND.
TuE following remarkable, fact shews tbe nece&-
sity of minutely examining people after death,.
prior to interment,·aqd 9f not g~viog way to ridi-
culous fears about aupernatural ap~arances.
The late Sir H~gh ~ckland, of Devonshire, ap-
parently died of a fever, and was laid out as dead•
.The nurse, with two of the footmen, sat up with
the corpse; and Lady Ackland sent them a bottle
of ~randy to drink in the nigqt. One of the ser-
~ts, being an arch rogue, told the other, that
his mas,ter dearly loved brandy when he was alive;
• ".and," says h~, " I am resolved be shall drink
one glass with us now he is dead," The'fellow,
accordingly, poured out a bumper of brandy, and
forced it. down his throat. A gurgling immedi-
ately ,ensued, and a violent motion of the neck
and upper part of the breast. ·. Th~ other footman
and the nurse were so terrified, that they ran down
·stairs; and the brandy genius, hastening away
with rather too much speed, tumbled down stairs
head fore~ost. The noise of the fall, and his
eries, alarmed a young gentleman who slept,in

The above story is well ·known to the Devon-

AGREEABLE EXPLANATION.
A GENTLEMAN of undoubted veracity relates
the following. story.
" Wbt>n I was a young man, I took up my re-
sidence at a lodging-house, ,which was occupied
by several families. On taking possession of my
apartm~n,!s, I agreed with the old lady of the
house, who had two ehiJdren, to accommodate
me with a key to the street.:door, to prevent un-
necessary trouble to the servant or family, as I

things more agreeable, I had alway• a light left

made, things continded'very comfortable for some
months ; till, one night, or ~ther morning, retum-

heard a faint scream--:J paused for a few seconds.

hesitated how to act, when·the' cry of _• Murder!'
was again more loudly vociferated. This very
much alarmed me; .and, instead of going forward,
I instantly re-opened the street-door, and was in
the act of calling the watch, when a tall spare
figure, at least:six feet high, in a complete white
dress, and pointed. cap, with a candle in its hand,
appeared before me. This unexpected encounter
complett>d my astonishment, and I was about to

at finding what r at first supposed. a supernatural

ta a divine exorcist.'' '
THE
SPMERSETSHIRE DEMONIAC.
' .
01!f the 13th of June 1788, Geofge Lukins, of
Yatton, in Somersetshire, was exorcised in· the
Temple Church at Bristol, and delivered from the
possession of seven devils by the efforts of seven
clergymen.
·Lukins was first attacked by a kind of epileptic
fit, when he was going about ,acting Christmas
play's, or mummeries : this he ascribed to a blow
giv!!n by an inviMble hand. He was afterwards
seized by fits; during which he declared with a
roaring voice that he was the devil, and sung dif-
ferent songs in a variety of keys. The fits always
began and ended'with a strong agitation of the
right hand; he frequently uttered drea_dful exe-
'K 4 erationa
212 SOMEBSETSHill& D_.BMONIAC.
crations during the fits: and the whole duration of
this disorder was eighteen years. ·
!t-t length, viz. in'June 1788, he declared, tli~t
he was possessed by seven devils, and ~uld only be
freed by the prayers, in faith, ofsev~n clergyJDen.
Accordingly, the requisite number was summoned,
and the patient sung, swore,"laugbed, barked~ and
treated the company with a ludicrous parody on
the Te Deum. These astonishing symptoms re-
aisted both hymns and prayers, till a 1mall, faint
eoice admonished the ministers to adjure. The
apirits, after some murm.uring, yie!ded to ~he ad-
juration; and the happy patient returned thanka ,
for ·his wonderful cure. It is remarka~le,. that,
during this sole(Du mockery, the fiend swore, by
his infernal den, that he would not quit his pa·'
tient; an oatb, l belie_ve, no. where to be found
bl}t in the ·Pilgrim's .Progress, (rom whence Lukins
probably got it.
Very .soon after the first relation of this story
was published, a person weJI acquainted with Lu-
kins, took the trouble of undeceiving the public,
with regard io his. pretended disorder, in a plain,
aensible, narrative of his 'conduct. He asserts,
. that Lukins's first s'eizure was nothing else than a
6t of drunkenness ; that he always foretold his
fits, and remained sensible during tbeir continu·
ance. ~hat be frequehtly, saw Lukins in his fi~s;
in
SOMERSETSHIB.E DEMONIAC, · 213
in every one of which, exCE'pt in singing, he per-
formed not more than most active young people
c~n easily do. That he was detected in an im-
posture with respect to the ·clenching of his hands.
That after money.had been collected for him, he
got v~ry suddenly well. That he never. had any
Jits while he was at St. George's Hospital, in
London ; nor when visitors were excluded from
his lodgings by desire of the author of the narra-
tive : and that he was particularly careful never
to hurt himself by his exertions during the
paroxysm.·
. Is it for the credit of this philosophical age,
t~at so bungling an imposture should deceive
seven clergymen into a public act of exorcism 1
This would not have passed even on the authora ·
of the Malleus Maleficaram.; for they required
signs of supernatural agency, such as the suspen-
sion of the posse~sed in the air without any visible
support, or the use of different languages, unknown
to the demoniac in his natural state.-

.FATAL EFFECTS OF W..lN7'0N MISCHIEP.
SoME years ago, a. very intelligen~, handsome,
and promisin~ youth, whose name is Henry Par-
_geter Lewis, the son of a respl!ctable attorney, in
,the town of Dudley, was placed f~)f a probation-
ary time, pre~iously to an intended apprentice- .
ship, with a surgeon and apothe:cary of the nam_e ·
of Powell; in the immediate neighbourhood of
one of our great public school1. He had not been
there long, before one of. the scholars, who
lod~d at the surgeo~'s, in league with the ser-
nnt-boy of the house, devised the following stra-
tagem to frighten him. One night, during an· ab-
sence of the maater, the servant-boy concealed
himself under the bell of Henry, be-fore the latte~
retired to rest, and· remai~ed there till the hour
of mi~night; when, on a preconcerted signal of
three raps at the chamber door, it suddenly
opened, and in stalked the scbpol-bo)t, habited in
a 'white aheet,,wi~h his face honibly disguised,
and bearing a lighted candle in his hand : tb~

went to call him; and, not answering, except by

The· melancholy tidings of his situation were
conveyed to his friends, on his removal to them ;
the facts· having been disclosed, partly by the

ltEMARKABLE INSTANCES
OF TH&
POWER OF VISION.
A S-HEPHERD upoa one 'of the mountains in
Cumberland, was suddenly en\eiOped with a thick
fog Cir mist, through which. every objec~ appeared
so greatly increased in magnitude, that ~e 110
longer .knew where he was. Jn this state 6f con-
fusion he wandered in search of some unknown
object, from w-hich be might direct his fut~re

steps. Chance, at last, brought thia lost shepherd
within "Bight of what he supposed to ·be··a very
.-large mansion, which he did not remem.ber ever to
have seen before ; but, on his enteriqg.this vision-
ary castle, to inquire his way home, he found it
inhabited by hilS own family. It was nothing more
than his own cottage. But his organs of sight had
so far misled his mental faculties, that some little
time elapsed before he could be convinced that he
saw real o~jects. Instances of the same kind .of
illusion, though not to the same degree, are not
unfrequent in those mouotai~ous regions.
From these efftcts of vision, it is eviden.t that
the pupil a~d the pi~tu:re·of·an object within the
eye, increase at the same time.
The writer o~ the above account was passing
the Frith of Forth, at. Queensferry, near E(iin-
burgh, one morning" when it was extremely foggy.
Though the water is only two miles broad, the
boat did not get within sight of the southern shore
till it approached very near it. He then saw, to
his great surprise, t large perpendicular rock,,
where he knew the shore was low and ahnost flat.
As the boat advanced ·a little nearer, the rock
seemed to split perpendicular!y int!> portions,
which separated at a little distance from one
another.. ·He next saw these perp«:ndic~lar divi-
sions.move; and, upon approaching a little nearer,

found it was a number of people,_ standing oli the
beach, waiting the arrival of the ferry-boat•
. '
-The following extract of a letter, from a gen-
tleman of undoubted veracity, is another curious
instance of the property of vision:-
c• When I was a young man, I was; like others,
fon,d of sporting, and seldom liked to miss a day,
if I could any way go out. From my own hou'se
I set out on foot, ~d pursued my diversion on a
-foggy day ; and, after 'I had been.out some time,
~he fog or mist increased to so great a degree,
that, however familiar the hedges, trees, &c. were
to me, I lost myself, insomuch that I -did not
know whether I was going to or from home. In a
f\eld where} then was, I suddenly discovered what
_I imagined was a well known hedge-row, inter-
spersed with ~liard trees, &c. under which I
purposed'to proceed_homewards; but, to my·great
surprise, upon approaching this appearance, I
discavered a row of the plants known by the name".
of rag, and by·the vulgar, Clinker weed, growing
• on a mere balk, dividing ploughed fields : the ·
whole height of both could not exceed three feet,
or three feet and a half. It struck me so forcibly
that I shall never forget it ; this too in a field
which I knew as well as any m~tn could know a
field."
THE
TH"t
PHILOsOPHER GASSENDI,'
AJID TRB
HAUNTED BED-ROOM.
IN·one of the Jetten ~f ~is celeb~ted philoso-
pher, he says, that he was consulted by his friend
and patron the Count d'Alais, governor of Pro-
vence, on a pb~nomenon that haunted his bed-
chamber while he was at Marseilles on some busi-
ness relative to his office. The Count tells Gas-
sendi, that, for several ·successive nights, as soon
as. the candle was taken away, he and his Countess
saw a h.tminous spectre, ·sometimes of an oval,
and·somdi~es of a triangular form ; that it al}'l'ays
disappelll'ed when light eam~ into the room ; that
hehad often struck at it, but could discover nothing
~olid. Gassendi, as a natural philosopher, endea-
voured to account for it; sometimes attributing it
to some defect of vision, or to some dampness of
tire room, insinuatin' that perhaps it might be
sent from Heann to him, to give him a warning
in due time of something that should happen.
The tpectre still continued its visits all the time
that he staid ~t Marseilles; and some years 1lfter-
wards, on their return to A,i.x, the Countess d'Alais
· confessed

confessed to her husbaad, that she played him thi1
trick, by means of one of her womep placed under
the bed with a phial of phosphorus, with an io.;
tention to frighten him away frora _Marseilles, a
place in which she very much disliked to live.
GHOST ON SHIP-BOARD.
A G.ENTLEMAN of high respectability in .the
navy relates the following story. .
" When on a voyage to New York, we had not
Been four days at sea, ~efore an occurrence of a
very singular nature broke in upon our quiet.
It was a glao&t I Oae night, ~hen all was still
and dark, and the ship rolling at sea before the
wind, a man sprung suddenly UpOn deck i"u his
·shi~t, hi• hair erec;t, his ey~s starting from their
sockets, and loudly vociferating he had seen a
ghost. After his borror had a little subsided, we
asked hi~ what he.had se'en1-he said~ the figure of
a woman dressed in white, with eyes of flaming fire;
that she came to his ·baminock, arrd stared him in
the face. This we treated as an idle dream, and
sent the frantic fellow to his bed. The story be-.
came the subject o{ every one.; and the sneceeding

!24. GHOST ON SHJP-BOAllD.·
night produced half a dozeil more terrified men
-to corroborate what had happened the first, and
all agreed in the same story, that it was a wo~.
This rumonr daily increasing, at leugth came to
the ears of the captain and officers, who were all
equally solicitous to discover the true cause of this
terrific report. I placed :myself night by night
beneath the hammocks to watch its appearance,
but all in vain ; yet still the appearance was
nightly, as usual, and the horrors and fears of the
people rather daily increased than diminished. A
phantom ofthis sort rather amused than perplexed
my mind; and when I bad given over every idea of
· .discovering the cause of this strange circumsta~ce,
and the thing began to wear away, I was surprised,
one very dark nigbt, as seated under tire boats,
with a stately figure in white stalking along the
deck ! The singularity of the ev.-.nt struck my
mind that this must be the very identical ghost
which had of late so much disturbed the ship's
company. I therefore instantly dropped· down
from the place I was in, to the deck' ~n which.it
appeared, .when it passed me immediately very
quickly, turned round, and marched directly for-
wards. I followed it closely, through the gallery,
and out 'at the head-doors, when the figure in-·
stantly disappeared, w~ich very mu-ch 1\Stonished
me. I then leape~ upon the forecastle, and asked '
of
OH()ST ON IHI:P-BOARD. 22i
of the people who were walking there, if soch a
figure had passed them t They replied, No, with .
some emotion and pleasure, as I bad ever ridiculed
all tht;ir reports on this subject. However, this
night-scene between me and the ghost became the .
theme of the ensuing day. Nothing particular
transpired· till twelve" o'clock, when, as the people
were pricking at the tub for their beef, it was
discovered Jack Sutton was missing. The ·ship's
company was directly mustered, and Jack was no
where to be foun~. I then inquired of his mess-
mate~ the character of the man; and, after anum-
ber of interrogatories", one of them said, that poor
Suttc;m used to tell him a number of comical jokes
about his walking in his sleep. Now the mystery
was unravelled ; and tbia terrific ghost, which had
so much alarmed all the sailors, now p~oved to be
the poor 'unfortunate Jack Sutton, who. bad walked
overboard in his dream. '
The first fellow who spread this rt>port, and
~ho shewed such signs of horror, was found on
inquiry to be a most ftagitious villain, who bad
murdered a woman, . who he believed alway•
bauntl!d him, and the appearance of this sleep-
walker confirmed in his mind the ghost of the
murdered fair one; for, in such cases, conscience
is a busy monitor, and ever active to its own pain
and <!isturbance. · -

A REMARKABLE STOR.Y
OF
A GHOST,
TArice. calledjor, tu an Evidence, in a Cot~rt
of JuBtice..
A FARMER, on hi11 return from the market at
Southam, in the c;ounty of Warwick, was mur-
dered. A man went the nell.t morning to his
house, and inquired of the !Jii&tr.ess, if her basband
came home the evening before; she replied~ No,
and tb,at she was ·under the utmost anxiety and.
terror on that account. ~· Your· tqror," ·added
he, " cannot equal mine; for, last night, as ll~y
in bed quite awake, the apparition of your hus-
band ap~ed to me, shewed me .several ghastly
stabs in his body,'told me that he had be4)n mur-
dered by such a person (naming the man), and hi•
body thrown into such a marl-pit, which he then
particularly described. The alarm was given,
the pit search~d, the body found, and the wounds
answered the description giyen of them. Th.e
man whom the ghost bad accused ' was appre-
hended, and committed, on a violent suspicion of
murder. His trial. came ort at Warwick, before

must be a,cquitled~: But, from many circum-
