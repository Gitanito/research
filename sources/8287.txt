For an instant, time stood still. I had my four children with me; Autumn, five years old; Summer, two years old; James, eighteen months old; and Brandon, three months old. I was scared to death for them. If it was not for the children needing me, I could have just let that feeling of calm and love take me away. Then I came back right when my van got smashed by the other car. I remember some lady pulling my oldest daughter from the car. Then I got out of the car. I was pretty shook up.  But when I saw my kids were okay, I was fine. I don't know why I didn't die, my van was totaled the whole front end on the driver's side smashed in. I am just glad, you know something told me that day to make my daughter Autumn sit in the back and I am so glad she did because the air bag popped out on that side first and she probably would have died.
