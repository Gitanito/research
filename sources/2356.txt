THE FLOWER MEDIUM
[Note by LP:—During the 1930s, an apport medium
produced what Nandor Fodor later called “tremendous
excitement” among Spiritualists. The case of Hilda
(sometimes spelt Hylda) Lewis left a mass of
documentation that is worthy of re-assessment.
Perhaps the longest reports were in “Psychic Science”,
but the briefer accounts in LIGHT as the argument
raged, occupied over 11,000 words. Readers who wish
to follow this can obtain an electronic copy of the
LIGHT reports from the editor of Psypioneer. We
reproduce below what must have been a very difficult
report for Mrs McKenzie to write for “Psychic
Science” readers.]
The accompanying photograph was taken by Mrs. Edwards at
her home in Highgate. The Flower Medium—Hilda Lewis is the
lady standing. At the time this photograph was taken the medium
was publicly known only as Miss X. The picture is taken from

BY MRS. HEWAT McKENZIE—PSYCHIC SCIENCE 1
In view of the confession of the Flower Medium, it seems necessary to put on record in
“Psychic Science” some facts relating to this mediumship, as articles which honestly supported
its complete genuineness appeared in the October, 1934 and January, 1935 issues, dealing with
seances held on the College premises.
When in June 1934 Mrs. Champion de Crespigny was invited to examine the manifestations,
she arranged for the sittings to be held at the College; no money was given to the medium, nor
was any money taken from sitters amongst whom were members and non-members of the
College invited personally by Mrs. de Crespigny. The matter was not brought before the College
Council, Mrs. de Crespigny preferring to keep it entirely in her own hands at this stage, though
members of the Council attended various sittings and discussed these with her. She also invited
various researchers to assist her, Professor Fraser-Harris, Lord Charles Hope, and others. The
sittings continued almost up to the time of Mrs. de Crespigny’s passing, and on my temporary

assumption of the duties of Hon. Principal in March, 1935, the continuance of investigation by
the Council was raised for the first time.
I had before me data as to suspicious incidents observed during the investigation, of some of
which Mrs. de Crespigny was aware, and with which she would have dealt had she survived,
which seemed to indicate that on some occasions at least the work of Miss Lewis was not
genuine.
Flowers were found in her attaché case at the College by three witnesses—an hour previously
she had refused proper examination of this case. Petals were found on various occasions in the
cloakroom where she had gone without a witness, corresponding with those of flowers produced
at current séances, and withered stems and leaves and fresh petals were found on the window-sill
of the same cloakroom. A reliable detective agency was employed, with Mrs. De Crespigny’s
cognizance, to follow Miss Lewis for a whole day previous to a séance at the College. After her
business hours, she was seen to visit four different flower shops in West End and to buy flowers,
the colours of which were noted. She was seen manipulating these outside one shop, placing
some under her coat and in her case, and the débris left on pavement was examined. She was
followed to the College door and seen to enter. Unfortunately on this occasion she was not taken
charge of immediately, her case secured and coat examined. The flowers produced at this séance
corresponded with those described in the detective’s report.
An infra-red film was exposed on her on several occasions by a College group; she wore no
coatee at these times, as she usually did. The light was insufficient for close personal observation
and full examination of her person was hindered. The film reveals constant movement of her
right hand, as if pushing something from behind. The flowers appear on the left as if oozing out
of her skirt band or from the split which had been observed in her bathing costume; an
unexplained loop of some kind of material was also noticed in the film and aroused suspicion.
The clairvoyance given by the medium at séances, from “Robin,” evoked much interest; the
details, names, etc. were amazingly accurate. Some sitters, who had an opportunity of comparing
notes on this, observed that these communications had almost invariably reference to telephonic
conversations which they had had in their own homes about the date of the séances which they
attended; the medium was often aware as to who would be present at séances. An enquiry began
as to Miss Lewis’s opportunities for acquiring such knowledge. She was known to be in the
employment of a City Firm, but what her job was, was not known. The authorities were informed
of the suspicions, and observation was made upon her, and on the telephone lines of various
persons. She suddenly lost her job, and made much capital out of the story that the Pepper
Scandal was responsible for her firm’s reduction of staff. She applied to one of the College
Council for assistance in securing a job, and told him she was on switch-board work. When he
proceeded to make inquiries, her late manager informed him personally of the reasons for her
instant dismissal at the request of authoritative persons.
At the request of the Council I interviewed Miss Lewis in March and told her of the various
allegations and of our knowledge of the above, and invited her, in order to re-verify her
mediumship, and for Mrs. de Crespigny’s sake, to give the College a series of six seances with a
friendly group, under conditions made by the Council. She was told that if she required flowers
151
at her séances they would be amply provided, but they must be marked College flowers. She
attempted some inadequate excuses in reply to the charges.
I saw her on a second occasion in the presence of Miss Evans, her friend, and Mrs. Hankey,
the College Secretary, and again asked her to consider the above proposal. Miss Evans wrote
some days later that Miss Lewis would give one séance at the College. This I refused.
Meanwhile she was visiting other Societies offering her services. She undertook a contract with
the Marylebone Spiritualist Association, and after two exhaustive test sittings, which appeared to
satisfy her examiners, broke her contract. Mr. T. Dudley Parsons, the Hon. Principal of the
Reading S.P.R. and an experienced lawyer, also states that he has seen the production of flowers,
under test conditions. Dr. Fodor says that his searchers found no flowers on the medium, but that
nevertheless flowers appeared at the sittings. His full report of the sittings has yet to appear. I
have also a full report of a sitting in a private house on April 13th from Mr. De Brath and Miss
Hyde in which they state positively, giving full details, as to the production of 12 roses and 6
sprays of lily-of-the-valley, after the medium had been stripped to the skin and re-clothed in
examined garments. All the flowers, produced together, were fresh and unbruised. They certify
that the medium never left the room, nor was for one moment out of sight.2
I think it well to
mention these facts, having no desire to suppress anything. She began to sit here, there and
everywhere, often twice a day, and to take money for her services. I have in my possession all
the data re above, and much more as to the early history of the medium, and have offered
examination of this to persons who are now making themselves responsible for further
examination of her mediumship but my offer has not been accepted. I may say that much
information has been supplied spontaneously by persons who have suffered through Miss
Lewis. I have letters from a dozen people, heads of Societies and private persons, who have
discovered flowers in her attaché case on their premises; on one occasion a pineapple was seen
by three responsible persons; this was produced afterwards as an “apport.”
She has seemingly always been gifted with a romantic imagination, to put it mildly, and
some of her imaginative ventures have had sorry outcomes both for herself and others. She
apparently came to a knowledge of spiritualism in 1931, and this gave her new ground to work
upon. It will be remembered that no one, unless Miss Evans, knew anything about her when
she was introduced to the College. She had boasted, however, to one of her hosts, that she
belonged to some occult society, and that sleight-of-hand was prominent in the instruction
received in order that the “members might protect themselves.” From what? This may only be
another fairy tale like so much else that issues from her lips and has been accepted at face-
value by her friends. In any case what has anyone working amongst spiritualists, and
postulating a saint as a guide, to do with sleight-of-hand?
Her “doctor” father guiding from the other side, is a myth; her father is alive. I have
evidence as to the origin of “Robin” in a very simple story, and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux is
little likely, if she wishes an earth contact, to use an instrument of this calibre. Some of the
statements accepted about the mediumship are likely to pass into legends and to prevent this, a
2
Psychic Science—A later addition to this positive report reveals that two roses were found before the séance
hidden in an armchair in which the medium was to be seated. She and Miss Evans had been in the room. (Mr. De
Brath was not made aware of this discovery).
152
few plain words may be of use to our readers. We may all be mistaken at times in the
investigation of the delicate forces of mediumship, but we must seek and find the truth
regarding these at all cost.
Marks of burning. Professor Fraser-Harris was accused of producing such marks on her skin by
touching her when in trance. This accusation has been repeated against the Professor ad nauseam
wherever Miss Lewis has held sittings, causing him much annoyance. In a letter to “Light” of August
29th, he has made it clear on what slender foundation this rests, and suggests how such marks could be
artificially produced. It made a good story to tell, however, to prevent other people from touching her.
Flowers out of season. A Colchicum, (autumn crocus) and forget-me-nots were produced on
one occasion and claimed to be impossible to find at that season. Both were found growing
freely in private gardens and public parks at the time.
Other Plane Flowers, or Heavenly Creations. “Sister Thérèse” claimed that the roses were
from spirit planes, and not apports. They have been duplicated on many occasions by flowers
bought in the open street. The usual rose was the well-known “Butterfly” which is largely
grown for commercial purposes. On one occasion a green fly was found on a rose examined by
a sitter, and shown to others. On other occasions “rust” has been found on the flowers. If
apports had been suggested these features might have been accepted.
Dew has been claimed as the origin of the moisture so frequently found on the roses. It has
been pointed out that dew is not only caught on outside leaves but within the rose; this
moisture was superficial, and on occasions had an unpleasant odour.
The sealing of the stem-ends was described as a non-mundane peculiarity. It is a common
commercial practice, to preserve the freshness of flowers!
Thornless roses. There are thornless roses on the market, and their suitability for
concealment is evident; it is also easy to remove thorns if necessary.
To give Miss Lewis the benefit of anything that can be said in favour of her mediumship, I
would note that she sat in good light with persons close to her on either hand, scrutinizing her
closely, and that she submitted to a degree of previous search of her person. The latter was
usually vitiated by the alleged on-coming of trance, by nausea and sickness, and by the use of a
towel which became an object of grave suspicion. The room in which she was examined and to
which she had free access was not always subject to the strict observation necessary. She often
escaped out of the hands of her examiners to the cloakroom without being kept under
observation, when otherwise the search was said to be satisfactory, so defeating the aims of her
examiners.
One investigator supplies me with data of occurrences which need further explanation. On
July 19, 1934, he sat in a group at the College, on her left side. “The medium lent forward and
her hands disappeared from view for a time. She then sat upright and placed her hands on her
knees, when I noticed a rough, greyish convex mass in which there was movement, suggesting a
heaving rubber sponge, in the midst of which I could see leaves and flowers which seemed to
153
form as the mass vanished. I did not speak of what I saw at the moment, but several other sitters,
among them Mrs. de Crespigny on her right, mentioned the appearance independently; others did
not see this.
“On July 28th
, I saw the ‘greyness’ again; my note read:- ‘The greyish mass was visible as
before.’ My recollection is that it was more mist-like and did not seem to be in movement.
“I thought I heard rustling as of leaves in a faint breeze and I saw leaves and rose buds in the
mist. I spoke of this after the séance, and Dr. Coulthard and Miss Tom-Gallon said they too had
seen it.
“On August 27th
, I saw this appearance again, and it was the least distinct of the three
occasions. One sitter said he saw ‘points of light’ in the greyness as the flowers were ‘coming.’
“On September 3rd
, I have an independent report from a person who sat next her that he saw
the ‘greyness.’ I did not on this occasion as I was not so near her.”
If anyone can add to these observations of such an appearance I shall be glad to hear from
them.
Lights have been observed during some dark seances. These when examined by experts, by
the spectroscope, corresponded with the spectrum of the light given by a small electric torch. At
the source of the light was observed what appeared to be the filament of an ordinary pocket lamp
electric bulb, and that Miss Lewis carried such an article is confirmed from another source. Does
this provide an explanation of the above ‘points of light?’
It would have been a great pleasure if we could have endorsed genuine mediumship of so
remarkable a nature, but instead we find ourselves faced with prevarication and deceit, of a
peculiarly distasteful kind, against devoted friends, who, accepting Miss Lewis’s story of her
wonders, gave her the utmost trust.
A new group of workers have now taken her in charge, and it is said that she will submit to
tests by an Oxford Society: this remains to be seen. A promise had been given to the Institute for
Psychical Research to continue the examination begun there by Dr. Nandor Fodor. It has now
been intimated to him that further sittings under ‘dangerous test conditions’ will not be given
until Hilda Lewis proves herself a bona-fide medium!
Some hazard that this girl is a pathological case, and deserving of our pity; that she really has
genuine psychic powers, but “provides” in case of failure. But this does not explain why she had
any need to “provide,” not only since last March as suggested when she began to take money for
seances, but while she was in a job, and receiving the devoted and loving interest of our late
Hon. Principal. It is my considered opinion, in view of all the facts I have before me, that psychic
students waste their time on such uncertain cases.

End Note by LP:—For the experiments in Oxford, the flower medium stayed at the home of J.
Cecil Maby. A report was published in Journal Society for Psychical Research (JSPR) 29
December 1936 p. 303-4. Maby was a trained botanist and he was not favourably impressed.
What eventually became of the medium? Just before the 1939 war there were reports of a
materialisation medium in Reading. Her name was Hilda Lewis.
Finally, and to return to the BCPS, the late Denise Iredell,3
daughter of Muriel Hankey the
secretary at the BCPS, wrote to Psypioneer:—
I cannot find any notes about what Muriel told me on several occasions and others of
what also happened at the examination of the Flower Medium. I should explain that
Mrs. de Crespigny was a woman of such probity herself that she could never entertain
the possibility that anyone could cheat. In this respect she was not a sound investigator.
She thought that an intimate physical examination (p.v., for instance) would be highly
indecorous. In the printed records there is no reference that Miss Lewis always went to
the w.c. immediately before the I. Mrs. de Crespigny would not allow Muriel to
accompany the medium even into the lavatory area. However, after the said visit to w.c
Muriel stood on the lid, put her hand up and into the cistern and withdrew it clutching
flowers—I think roses!!
I’m quite happy to come in on this matter if you write about the Flower Medium. I
consider it is quite important that Muriel’s finding of the flowers in the flushing cistern
should be mentioned, if any assessment is now being made. Forty years ago Muriel
was anxious that the matter should not be brought up to stir up trouble again, but
maybe now, forty years on, the matter can be written about with the safety of distance
in time.
Denise also stated that in tracing the phone activity of Miss Lewis, it was necessary to enlist the
aid of the authorities. Mrs Hankey’s husband was quite well connected, and a sympathetic
former Home Secretary put in a word. He was Mr Churchill M.P.

THOMAS SHORTER—THE MEDIUM AND DAYBREAK 4
[Note by LP:— We are privileged to reprint this
biographical sketch of an eminent working class
Spiritualist, editor and reformer, which reminds us once
more of the industriousness of the first pioneers. Mr.
Shorter fell into undeserved obscurity, considering that
he was once, as the author here notes “perhaps, the most
voluminous writer on Spiritualism in this country.”]
~~~~~~~~
The subject of our present sketch was born in London, in
that busy hive of watchmaking industry, the parish of
Clerkenwell, in the year 1823, on the first day of
November, the month in which—according to the French
novelists—Englishmen generally hang and drown
themselves. Losing his father at an early age, and the
mother being left with a family of young children, he had
little opportunity of school education, but soon
manifested a passion for reading, eagerly devouring
whatever books came in his way, for he had no judicious Mentor to guide his choice, and,
indeed, little chance of picking and choosing.
At eleven years of age he began the battle of life as an errand boy with Southgate, the book-
auctioneer, in Fleet Street. At thirteen he was apprenticed to the business of a watch-case joint
finisher, his regular hours of work being in summer from six in the morning till eight at night,
and in the winter from seven till nine. At that time there was no working-men’s college, and the
only means of mental cultivation free to him, besides such few books as his scanty means could
buy, was by what were known as “mutual improvement societies,” and by attendance at public
meetings and lectures, and at coffee-houses, where discussions were held on public affairs and
on questions social, political, and theological. He took a keen interest in these subjects, and when
only about fifteen years of age, occasionally joined in these coffee-house debates and began to
receive invitations to deliver public lectures, with which he complied whenever it was possible to
do so. His sympathies were especially enlisted in favour of the socialist movement, to which the
impulse was given by Robert Owen, and to the political movement for the enfranchisement of
the working-classes.
When about eighteen he became honorary secretary to a branch society of the friends of the
former movement in Finsbury; and was one of a committee of five who drew up the rules of the
first Bowket Building Society in London, and remained on its board of management till other
4

156
avocations compelled him to withdraw from it. He also joined the committee of the People’s
Charter Union, and took an active part in forming a small local society in Finsbury, which was
its immediate precursor. His political action at one time very nearly brought him into serious
trouble. He had been the leading speaker at a public meeting at Farringdon Hall; a grossly false
report of his speech appeared the following day in the Morning Chronicle, in which sentiments
and language of the most violent and outrageous character were imputed to him; and on this
scurrilous report a leading article was based, calling on the Government to prosecute the speaker.
That this recommendation was not adopted was probably due to the circumstance that a
Government reporter was present, and made a verbatim report of the proceedings. An indignant
letter from Mr. Shorter appeared in the Morning Chronicle, but the editor declined to withdraw
the false and offensive imputations that had been made.
The great political events of 1848 and the letters on “London Labour and the London Poor,”
which appeared in the Morning Chronicle, and at the time attracted such wide attention, gave a
new impulse to inquiries into the condition of the working classes, and to efforts for its
amelioration. One of these may be here referred to.The late Professor Maurice and Professor
Kingsley, with Mr. Thomas Hughes, Mr. J. M. Ludlow, and other professional gentlemen,
invited certain working men, among whom were Mr. Walter Cooper, Mr. Joseph Milbank, and
Mr. Thomas Shorter, to meet them in order to learn the views and feelings of those working men,
and to confer with them as to any practical measures which it might be considered advisable in
consequence to adopt. The outcome of these conferences was the establishment in 1850 of the
Society for Promoting Working Men’s Associations, afterwards called the Association for
Promoting Industrial and Provident Societies, and to which Mr. Shorter was appointed secretary.
Several industrial co-operative societies were formed in London—tailors, shoemakers,
engineers, printers, bakers, pianoforte-makers, &c., and a central co-operative agency was
established in London (chiefly through the generous aid of Mr. Edward Vansittart Neale) for
supplying co-operative stores throughout the country with groceries of unadulterated quality and
at wholesale prices, and a correspondence was entered into with these and all co-operative
societies in Great Britain, of which information could be obtained, in order to promote greater
unity of action among them and mutual support. A register was also kept, giving the date of
formation of each society, the number of its members, the amount of business done by it, and
such other particulars as it was deemed useful to learn, and which these societies were willing to
communicate.
Mr. Shorter attended as Secretary the Annual Co-operative Conferences convened by the
Society and held in London, Manchester, and Leeds, and took part in the public meetings
which followed. It would be out of place, and would occupy too much space to enter here into
the causes which led to the failure of this movement in London. It may be sufficient to say that
co-operation can only be successfully carried out by co-operators, and that most of the
members of these industrial co-operative societies had no previous knowledge of co-operation,
and were only interested in it for what they hoped individually to get out of it; and the few who
really cared for co-operation as a principle, had little of the practical knowledge and business
experience on which success in business is so largely dependent.
157
The movement of “Christian Socialism,” as it was termed, however, bore some valuable
fruit. Its publications, lectures, meetings, and conferences did much to spread a knowledge of
the principles of co-operation throughout the country, to elevate; the moral tone of the
movement, to diffuse a higher spirit amen its workers, and to smooth the road for co-operators in
the future. Mainly owing to the indefatigable exertions of Messrs. Hughes and Ludlow, the
Industrial and Provident Societies Act was passed, by which legal protection to these societies
was first obtained. The Working-Men’s College in Great Ormond Street, founded in 1854, was
the direct outgrowth of the Christian Socialist movement, and Mr. Shorter was appointed its
secretary, a position which he held till 1867, when ill-health and failing sight led him to resign
the responsible office, whose duties he could not efficiently discharge, and which he left not
without substantial evidence of the good-will of those with whom he had so long been working.
Mr. Shorter’s investigations into Spiritualism began in 1854, and his experiences were
published in a series of papers in the Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph in 1856 and 1857. This was
the first extended narrative of the kind in England. It was subsequently published in a volume
(now out of print), entitled “Confessions of a Truth-seeker.” Besides being a constant contributor
to the Yorkshire (subsequently the British) Spiritual Telegraph, he contributed to other journals
more or less devoted to the advocacy of Spiritualism. Among these were The Two Worlds, a
weekly journal, edited by Dr. Dixon, advocating Spiritualism, homœopathy, and total abstinence;
the Spiritual Times, the first weekly journal in London exclusively devoted to Spiritualism; and
the Biological Review. In connection with Mr. W. M. Wilkinson he established in 1860 the
Spiritual Magazine, to which he has ever been a constant contributor; though, from loss of sight
at the commencement of last year, the resigned its editorship to Dr. Sexton. Besides numerous
contributions, in prose and verse, to spiritual journals, several volumes and pamphlets on
subjects connected with Spiritualism have been written by him. These include the volume
already named; “The Two Worlds,” a work of some 500 closely-printed pages, the fruit of much
careful reading and research; an essay on “What is Religion?” in which the bearings of
Spiritualism in its rotation to religion are considered and defined; a “Reply to a Sermon by the
Rev. John Jones Zones, entitled ‘Spiritualism the Work of Demons;’” a “Sketch of the Life of
John Murray Spear;” an essay, entitled “Concerning Miracles;” a treatise on “Immortality in
Harmony with Man’s Nature and Experience;” and a small volume of poems, entitled “Wayside
Verses,” chiefly in illustration of spirit-communion and kindred themes. It may not be out of
place to mention here that the plan of a spiritual Institute, as it appeared on the cover of one of
the early numbers of Human Nature, was drawn up by Mr. Shorter, as were also the addresses
severally presented to Emma Hardinge, William Howitt, and Judge Edmonds; and he has
recently contributed the article on “Modern Spiritualism” to the new edition of Chambers’
Encyclopædia, by invitation of its editor, at the special recommendation of Mr. Alfred Russel
Wallace.
Mr. Shorter has never been a professional lecturer, but he has freely given himself to the
advocacy of the spiritual philosophy from the platform, as well as in the press. He was one of the
promoters of the Conferences on Spiritualism in 1869, hold in Lawson’s Rooms, Gower Street,
in which Emma Hardinge took the lead—one of the most useful series of meetings in connection
with the movement ever held in the metropolis. Mr. Shorter, by request of the committee, acted
as vice-president, and delivered the opening address, and, next to Emma Hardinge, he was the
most frequent speaker at these meetings.
158
On his retirement from the post of secretary to the Working-Men’s College in 1867, a number
of friends who appreciated his services to Spiritualism presented him with a testimonial as an
expression of their sympathy and regard. His address in acknowledgement of this mark of
kindness and good-will towards him, published in the Spiritual Magazine for April, 1868, is an
example of his public oratory.
In addition to his writings on Spiritualism, Mr. Shorter has been a contributor to other
branches of journalism and literature. Among these journals we may mention Cooper’s, Journal,
Christian Socialist, Journal of Association, Weldon’s Register, Working-Men’s College Magazine,
and Quarterly Journal of Education, of which latter journal he was for three years the editor; he
was also for some time sub-editor of the London American, a weekly newspaper devoted to the
cause of the American Union during the great civil war in the United States. Several reading-
books of general interest, though most of them primarily intended for scholastic use, have been
compiled and edited by him. These are, “Poetry for School and Home” “A Book of English
Poetry,” “A Book o' English Prose,” “Shakespeare for Schools and Families,” “Love: a Selection
of Poems from the best Poets.”
It will be seen from this brief sketch that Mr. Shorter’s life has not been an idle one. He has
been, perhaps, the most voluminous writer on Spiritualism in this country. When the committee
of the Dialectical Society began its investigation, Mr. Shorter was one of the first persons to
whom they applied for information and advice, and his letter to the committee and the evidence
given by him appear in its Report. Though failing sight and ill-health now cripple his efforts,
and prevent the execution of some important works on Spiritualism he has long contemplated,
his interest in all questions affecting human improvement, and especially in a broad catholic
Spiritualism, is unabated, and to its advocacy the best powers of his mind are still devoted.
Our portrait is taken from a photograph by Mr. F. Hudson, of 2, Kensington Park Road,
Notting-Hill Gate, and the earlier part of this memoir from the Bee-Hive newspaper of Nov.
20th last.

THE PHYSICAL MEDIUMSHIP of
GORDON HIGGINSON
[Note by LP:—In our April issue,5
we printed an inside account by
Dr Barrie Colvin about the 1977 Sunday People story attack on
Gordon Higginson., which explained how Dr Colvin, who did not
instigate it, came to check it before publication by meeting the
reporter (the year of this meeting was 1977, and not 1974 as
wrongly printed by us). Higginson commented on the People story
in his autobiography:—On the side of Angels (1993) which was
compiled by Jean Bassett.]
[Note by Psypioneer:—Brigadier Frank Spedding’s report is
published after “Gordon Higginson replies.” Spedding mentions in
his report three guides/controls during the séance he attended:
Paddy—Kuku—and an older man who welcomed the sitters. The
last is probably Choo Chow, his primary guide during his trance
work and teaching. Paddy generally took charge at Higginson’s physical circles. As to Kuku—
Cuckoo, Higginson had said this young black girl was with him during his early schooldays.
Gordon Higginson’s autobiography referred to— On the side of Angels—is still available at
Psychic News Bookshop Online.6
The photograph was taken at a Bedford Corn Exchange demonstration circa 1974.]
Gordon Higginson replies: —On the Side of Angels 7
I, along with other mediums, have often been accused by sceptics of secreting muslin or such
about our persons or even swallowing the stuff only to regurgitate or produce it during the
seance. If so, how then is it dry to the touch? How then can the material be soft at one moment
and hard the next? These sceptics ignore the variety of textures, the density and the speed with
which it moves from one location to the next.
What vast quantities of material would have to be used and manipulated in the dark to
produce the results of just one successful sitting, one where normally people are sitting so close
that they could, with little difficulty, reach out and touch me as at Barbie’s flat. There, two sitters
were one on either side of me, holding my hands.

One person, a scientist called Dr Colvin, instigated a most dreadful story in the national
papers. He and a brigadier, who also belonged to the Society for Psychical Research, said one of
my seances was a cheat. Dr Colvin stated that he searched the library at Stansted Hall before a
seance and found yards of material hidden in my chair.
Neither he nor the paper in question offered any explanation of why he had not complained at
the time and waited four years before releasing this accusation. If he had discovered material
secreted in my chair, why did he not draw the attention of the people present to this fact at the
time?
Dr Colvin did not offer an explanation of how the material was manipulated. The materialised
forms often move yards away from where I am seated; they float above the head and sometimes
seem to just disappear, as if into a hole in the floor. He did not mention any equipment which
would, presumably, have to be used in order to produce shapes and movement.
Anyone who knows Stansted Hall also knows that the floors are solid and that any such
hole for ectoplasm to disappear into would be immediately obvious. It is not only my integrity
in question when these accusations are made, but also the integrity of the people who organise
and those who witness the event. During the seance, Dr Colvin was invited to feel the
ectoplasm and had declared to all present that it had a gauze-like texture. If he was going to
make a statement four years later to national papers, then it would have been better had he said
so at the time. Well-known Spiritualist Peter Parnham was present at this session and made a
statement in my defence. It was his mother’s materialised form that was one of those “bits of
cloth.” Peter resented the implications that first I was a cheat, and then that he and all those
present were so gullible as to be fooled by such methods.
He pointed out that his mother had given intimate personal evidence of her identity, and
that as she came away from the cabinet he and his sister remarked how tall she was. The
control said that was because they had not materialised her legs. Once this was done, she
assumed her normal proportions of some four feet ten inches. The form did not come back into
the cabinet for this adjustment, but it was made there and then.
Incidentally, the seance was taped. Peter ordered a copy after the seance as Dr Colvin was
offering them for sale. When he received it some time afterwards his mother’s speech was not
on the tape. You can imagine that when all this came out I felt quite sick. Spirit have been so
good to me over the years, but they are powerless to protect me from the venom in this sort of
affair. Incidentally, after a lengthy investigation, the verdict of a tribunal to investigate
allegations after I demonstrated in Bristol was “Not proven.”
I was so very upset at Dr Colvin’s claims. They came when the union was holding its
annual general meeting. Distraught, I just could not attend the Sunday of conference after
reading of the accusations in a Sunday paper. It had surely been timed just for this! I was
ashamed that my name should be so used; I was ashamed that Spiritualism should be so
smeared. I was actually frightened of the support that I knew I should get from our members. I
didn’t want to risk breaking down. And I truly felt that I might.
161
I cannot say how it hurts me when I read of such things. I do not gain materially. Such
events as materialisation seances do not even enhance my ego for I know nothing of them other
than that which is relayed to me afterwards. Even photographs are not proof for the sceptic.
The Spiritualist papers picked up the story and printed it. I was cross at the time, but then I
was going through a very bad patch. I had been threatened physically. Bomb threats were sent
to my church and my home. I was ready to give up altogether. Good friends defended me,
Spirit stayed close, but it was a difficult time and I cannot forget these sort of things.
Spirit forms who are both larger and smaller than me have materialised over the years,
sometimes more than one at the same time! I am trying to be honest here. Not all have been
recognised by their features, but many have. This is something that cannot be done by trickery.
Above all is the evidence that they present, the personal information, the little matters like a
father’s braces which were always falling down help in their recognition.
All these are part of the signs and wonders permitted to us from the spirit world not just to
show us that we go on, but that our love links do not die: they are always there for us. It is
some time now since I have sat just for materialisation. My health does not permit this these
days.
I don’t believe anything is right for those who are determined not to believe; they will
believe what they want to believe. I have risked my health and strength over the years.
Materialisation mediumship does produce changes in the body during the production of
ectoplasm. This can—and often does—have an effect on the biological balance of the body and
can be detrimental to the medium.
The sceptic cries “Fraud!” They produce magicians who by trickery can produce
“phenomena.” They risk nothing for if they do not prove fraud they merely state that the
medium is “too clever.” Their world is flat: they do not see the wonder of the Master. Their
minds are closed: they do not accept the glorious diversity and splendour of the works of God.
I would not change the work I have done except perhaps to make it better. I have been very
privileged to be the instrument through which many have found comfort, hope and strength.”

SITTING WITH GORDON HIGGINSON
AT STANSTED HALL
By Frank Spedding, March 23rd
1974
[Note by LP:—We are printing below Brigadier Spedding’s report on the séance – which
report it is doubtful the medium ever saw. It will be apparent that there are several problems
with the Spedding report.
1) He concludes with some general remarks about the supposed credulity of Spiritualists
which are not really called for in a description of a séance. Whether or not Spiritualists
(or for that matter psychical researchers) are credulous is a wider question requiring
much more evidence—certainly the investigation of the flower medium, reported
elsewhere in this issue, involving several Spiritualist societies working together
{British College of Psychic Science (BCPS), London Spiritualist Alliance (LSA),
International Institute for Psychical Research (IIPR) etc} showed considerable acuity.
2) The Brigadier witnessed one séance. Crookes wrote about Florence Cook after
numerous séances. This does remind us that when a person sees a single séance with a
particular medium, he is perhaps as likely to be repelled as convinced, a disadvantage
of séances for rather disparate groups.
3) Inevitably Spedding was confined to the séance room, and therefore did not see the
precautions taken before the séance began. The normal sequence was events was:
a) GH searched
b) GH visits gents at Stansted.
c) GH enters séance room.
It was once pointed out to GH that evidentially, it would be better if (b) came before (a) but he
adhered to his custom, and in any case, no muslin or the like was ever found in the Stansted
gents. Nevertheless, to anyone who recalled the flower medium, and her use of the ladies
lavatory at BCPS as a hiding place, this was unfortunate.]
Spedding’s report:
Since a cassette record of the sitting, made by Dr. B. G. Colvin, will be available, the
following notes give my general impressions and do not contain any verbatim statements by
those present.
The sitting was specially arranged for members of the Eltham Spiritualist Church and rather
over sixty of these arrived by coach at about 3pm and returned after the sitting. Also present at
163
the sitting were a few members of the staff of Stansted Hall and four ‘outsiders’, these being Dr.
Barrie Colvin, an SPR member, a Mr. Joe Mckie from Newcastle, my wife and myself. Dr.
Colvin and Mr. Mckie are interested in carrying out research into materialisation phenomena
with Gordon Higginson and had a discussion with him before the meeting at which he said he
would like to co-operate, but I gathered that this would be very much on his own terms—for
example, photographs could be taken only when the ‘guides’ give permission. He allowed Dr.
Colvin to bring a camera to the meeting, but just before it started he told him that some of the
Eltham group had complained that, as they had been told that no photographing would be
allowed, it would be unfair for Dr. Colvin to use his camera and asked him to remove the camera
which he had mounted on a tripod. I very much doubt if anyone had complained, and I think it
was just an excuse to prevent Dr. Colvin taking photographs.
The seating arrangements and the position of the cabinet seemed to be in exactly the same
format as the sitting attended by Dr. Alan Gauld on the 26th May 1972; so was the general
pattern of events. The main difference was in the lighting. It was a dull evening and practically
no light came through the gaps between the window curtains and the ceiling. A 60w red light
controlled by a rheostat was used throughout the meeting. It was mounted on the top of the
cabinet at the front and was controlled by Dr. Colvin. Even with the red light on, the front
interior of the cabinet was in complete darkness and I found it difficult to see whether the
curtains were drawn. During the sitting, ‘figures’ appeared from time to time a foot or so in front
of the cabinet. All I could see was the top of the figure’s head, which looked remarkably like that
of the medium covered in some sort of material and dimly illuminated by the red light; then what
might have been a face, but it was too dark to distinguish any features; then a quantity of
‘ectoplasm’ starting from where the figure’s mouth might have been and trailing down into
darkness. The ‘ectoplasm’ seemed to be an inch or two wide at the top, broadening out to eight
or nine inches when it became no longer visible. On two occasions the ‘guide’ announced that
the medium AND a materialised figure or figures would be seen together. What I saw was the
vague outline of the medium and at his side an object (and on accession two objects) about the
size of melons with ‘ectoplasm’ coming down from them. It must be emphasised that the light
was very dim indeed.
The proceedings started with a short talk from Higginson which included a request for Dr.
Colvin to remove his camera. He explained that a meeting would be arranged in the future at
which photographs may be taken. It was emphasised that no-one should get up in order to touch
their ‘loved-ones’ and that it is possible that nothing will happen at all. After the singing of the
23rd Psalm, Higginson said a prayer. He then entered the cabinet and the only form of lighting
was the small red light on the top of it. After several minutes we heard heavy breathing followed
by the appearance of what purported to be a much older man who welcomed the sitters with the
words ‘Bless you! He continued:—“We greet you in the name of the spirit and ask that you put
aside all that may come between us. And to know that as we gain life from the same God, we
are? in love, we have the same opportunities ...........”
He asked that his chair be placed in the cabinet and he followed it. After sitting down we
heard some heavy breathing followed by the voice of ‘Kuku’ saying “We won’t be long now”.
Heavier breathing followed and then we heard ‘Paddy’ who was well known to the sitters. He
asked us to sing something Irish in order to break the ice. This was accordingly followed by a
164
verse of ‘If you’re Irish’. After further heavy breathing, a whitish form appeared at the join of the
curtains which prompted the sitters to coax the entity a little further out of the cabinet. Paddy
then asked that the gentleman controlling the light should make it a little brighter, which was
done at once. The medium was clearly seen standing up in the cabinet and a length of
‘ectoplasm’ was apparent. It appeared to come from the mouth of the medium and almost
reached the floor. He then returned to the interior of the cabinet and there followed a period of
clairvoyance, still with the voice of Paddy. The dialogue was as follows:—
“Hey, I want to say first of all that I have a gentleman that’s going to try and manifest, who
says that there is a lady here that has the initials of N and F”.
(Yes, Daddy!)
“Can you hear all right?” (Yes)
“Is there someone with the initials of N and F?”
After some difficulty in finding the relevant recipient, Paddy says:—
“Hey, this gentleman is talking about Rochester Way”
(Yes, that’s right)
“He says that he knows something about it”
(Oh, I suppose he does)
“Can you follow now”
(Yes)
“He says that he’s got something here to do with the name of Flower”. “Can you follow
now?”
(Yes, that’s the lady’s name - Mrs. Flower)
Paddy then explains that he would like us to sing in order that the entity may build more easily.
The dialogue continues:—
“The gentleman that’s here is a relation to you through marriage that wants to come to you.
The lady, will she speak to us? ..... it’s a gentleman named Flower, is this your father-in-law?”
(Oh, my father-in-law ... bless his heart)
“Hey, he wants to be remembered to you. Can you follow now?”
(Yes, I can follow .........)
165
“Can you follow now?”
(Yes)
At this stage a white figure appeared at the entrance of the cabinet and the sitters tried to coax
him out saying ‘Come along ......’ Paddy stated that the form was quite separate from the medium
and the sitters tended to agree with this. Personally, I was quite unable to verify this from my
seat which was on the front row (but a little to the side) He then asked that the light be turned
down a little. This was done. After some general discussions, Paddy said that the ‘gentleman’
was giving him the number ‘375’. The recipient replied that she lived at this number. Paddy then
said that he would try to get the gentleman out and emphasised that the light should stay as it is.
The sitters then began to sing ‘When Irish Eyes Are Smiling’. At the end of the song, the
materialised form could be clearly seen although no definite features could be distinguished. It
approached the recipient (a lady in the front of the meeting) and began to speak in a whispery,
almost inaudible voice:—
“Bless You”
(Bless You)
“How are you?”
(Oh, I’m fine)
“It’s so nice to see you”
The form returned to the cabinet and we then heard Kuku’s voice again. A number of similar
‘materialisations’ followed, the dialogue between sitters, Paddy, Kuku and spirit form being
recorded on the tape.
Sometimes Paddy would call out a name and several sitters would answer ‘Yes, we know
him’. In such cases, Paddy would ask for a message to be delivered to the absent member. Exact
addresses were nearly always given and, as far as I remember, there was only one mistake; 827
instead of 837, as a house number. I could see no difference between any of the materialised
forms except when the form and the medium appeared together and then the head was smaller.
Before Higginson went into trance he said he had asked two ladies to sit close to the cabinet
on either side to restrain any sitters who were carried away by emotion and might try to clasp the
materialised form of their loved one. In the event, their services as guard-dogs were not required.
When the child ‘Kuku’ spoke, several sitters who seemed to have had previous acquaintance
with her tried to cajole her out of the cabinet in the sort of tones one would use to entice a small
dog from under a table:—‘Come on Kuku, come on dear, don’t be shy—come on, there’s
nothing to be afraid of’.
166
Afterwards, my wife was in the cloakroom with about a dozen of the Eltham group and they
were all eulogistic about the sitting; not a word of criticism or disappointment.
Our opinion was that the materialisations were crude fakes which should not have deceived
anyone of normal intelligence. Higginson said he only gives four materialisation sittings a year,
but I believe he gives a lot of platform demonstrations and his speciality is the production of
accurate names and addresses. In the present instance, it would have been easy to memorise a
few names and addresses of members of the Eltham Spiritualist Church who were likely to be
present. It didn’t matter if they were there or not; someone could always pass on a message from
a ‘deceased’ relative. The accuracy with which he was able to give a few family details was
puzzling at first hearing, but analysis of the tape recording might throw further light on this.
Whether it was significant or not, Higginson changed from his fairly light-grey suit he was
wearing in the afternoon to a pair of dark trousers and a dark blue pullover which made it even
more difficult to see him in the cabinet. He also made no secret about removing his shoes before
he went into trance.
At the sitting at which Dr. Gauld was present, a number of sitters actually touched the
‘ectoplasm’. Nothing like this happened on the present occasion and Higginson made it very
clear that touching was not going to be allowed.
Incidentally, Higginson announced that he had been searched by one of the Eltham visitors. I
had, by chance, spoken to this man beforehand and he struck me as a simple and sincere sort of
person, unlikely to have been an accomplice. As Higginson was never stripped completely to be
searched, it would have been relatively easy for him to conceal a length of nylon gauze or some
such material.
Dr. Gauld mentioned an incident when a lady close to the cabinet was told by Higginson that
some threads of her white underskirt had been taken and used (presumably by Paddy to build up
materialisations—I can’t see what else they could have been wanted for). The same thing
happened on this occasion but I didn’t see the significance of it.
To sum up, the platform clairvoyance gave a number of accurate names and addresses and
some family details, but I noticed that on a few occasions when a direct question was asked, it
was not answered. The materialisations were so obviously fraudulent that one is left wondering
how so many people who presumably conduct their lives in a reasonable way can accept such
rubbish with apparent enthusiasm. Is it because they dare not let one thought of doubt or
criticism enter their minds, for if they did this whole balloon of self-deception would be
punctured and what they now believe is a life-line to the next world would just disappear.
Frank Spedding

167
We are grateful to Dr Alan Gauld for the following comments in June
2010:—
Yes, I did indeed attend a Higginson materialisation session at Stansted, and remember it rather
well. So far as I can recall I did not write any ‘Report’ on it for anyone, though I did make some
notes on it (probably buried somewhere in the mass of files in my garage!) and I may have
mentioned it to Frank Spedding. I went with the members of a home circle I sat in in Leicester
for some years. My experiences were very much the same as those of Frank Spedding and Barrie
Colvin, except that the light was unusually good. A bright evening sun filtered through the blinds
and we had quite a good view of the ‘phenomena’. The materialisations appeared to me to be
egregiously fraudulent. I could quite clearly discern the plump figure of the perambulating
Higginson through what appeared to be a sheet of fine nylon net curtaining that served as
‘ectoplasm’. When, as the piece de resistance, ‘the medium and the materialisation came out
together’ the materialisation was manifestly Higginson holding up his hand in front of him to let
the nylon hang down from it. In fact the minor phenomena that took place at the above—
mentioned home circle were far more puzzling and interesting than the Higginson
materialisations. I could not understand the gasps of amazement from the sitters in the front row
(I suppose we were about three rows back) as the materialized figures passed them. But then who
am I to say that they rather than I were victims of ‘motivated seeing’?
The incident at the end of the sitting was as follows. The materialisations had ceased and
Higginson came out of the cabinet to address us. He turned to the lady who was sitting outside
and just to the right of the cabinet (from our point of view—i.e. to Higginson’s left) and asked
her if she was wearing a nylon underskirt. She seemed rather taken aback by this question, but
said that she was (as I recall she was a Mrs. Betty Wakeling, a medium from Blackpool). He then
warned her not to be surprised if she found a few threads were missing from this underskirt,
because ‘they’ (the spirits) had run out of ectoplasm and had had to make up the deficiency.
Words fail one!
Discussing the sitting afterwards with the lady who had sat next to me (another circle member
who was also a member of the SPR) we both agreed that there was nothing in the sitting that
needed explaining except how he got the nylon netting into the cabinet (she had her own theories
about that). As for the matter of the nylon underskirt, she remarked that what had happened was
probably this (which is the only way I can think of to make sense of Higginson’s absurd
question). The centre of the library floor was covered with some rather rough matting (coconut?)
and Higginson, walking along under cover of his ‘ectoplasm’, must have felt the nylon sheet
catch on the matting. He was afraid that some captured threads from it might have remained
behind for unspiritual persons to detect and wonder about, and therefore invented this ready—
made excuse.
Before this I had been to a couple of his demonstrations of clairvoyant mediumship and was
quite impressed. I had heard some of the pieces of circulating scuttlebutt about his methods of
obtaining advance information concerning sitters, but didn’t take them seriously. However one of
them was to the effect that he was in the habit of himself taking the mail from the Stansted Hall
post box to the post office in town and examining it en route. This too I dismissed as scuttlebutt
until later when some friends and neighbours of ours (a husband and wife, keen spiritualists)
168
went there for a weekend. When they got back she was enthusing to my wife and myself about
the correct information they had received from Higginson about their private concerns. But her
husband suddenly interjected ‘you know that was all on the card you sent to Paul (her son in
Germany) and posted from the Hall.’
[End Note by LP:—As with our previous article, we do not claim to have explained the GH
physical mediumship. From some other seances, conducted in a different way, there are reports
of impressive ectoplasm from experienced witnesses. The sinking of materialisations into the
floor, though simulated by other mediums in various ways, also puzzled observers on occasion.]
