  NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE REMAINS A MYSTERY&nbsp;
  (pp 2010, 2039)

Authors of a Dutch study in this  week's issue of THE LANCET conclude that medical explanations cannot account  for the phenomenon known as near-death experience (NDE). Only a relatively small  proportion of patients who became clinically dead (resulting in oxygen  deprivation to the brain) reported NDEs after successful cardiac resuscitation.

Some people report a near-death  experience (NDE) after a life-threatening crisis. Most previous NDE research has  been retrospective and is therefore of limited value. Pim van Lommel and  colleagues from Hospital Rijnstate, Arnhem, The Netherlands, aimed to establish  the cause of this experience and assess factors that affected its frequency,  depth, and content.

344 cardiac patients who were  successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest in ten Dutch hospitals were  prospectively studied. All patients had been clinically dead. NDE was defined as  the reported memory of all impressions during a special state of consciousness,  including specific elements such as out-of-body experience, pleasant feelings,  and seeing a tunnel, a light, deceased relatives, or a life review. The  investigators compared demographic, medical, pharmacological, and psychological  data between patients who reported NDE and patients who did not (controls) after  resuscitation. In a longitudinal study of life changes after NDE, the  investigators compared the groups 2 and 8 years later.

62 patients (18%) reported NDE, of whom  41 (12%) described a core (deep) experience. Occurrence of the experience was  not associated with duration of cardiac arrest or unconsciousness, medication,  or fear of death before cardiac arrest. NDEs were more common among people  younger than 60 years; deeper NDE experiences were more common among women.  Substantially more patients who had an NDE-especially a deep experience-died  during or shortly after NDE-related hospital stays. At two-year follow-up,  people who had NDE had a significant increase in belief in an afterlife and  decrease in fear of death compared with people who had not had NDE. At  eight-year follow-up, people who had reported NDE generally did not show any  fear of death and strongly believed in an afterlife, in contrast to people who  had not reported NDE.

In an accompanying Commentary (p 2010),  Christopher French from Goldsmiths College, University of London, UK, cautions  that problems with NDE definition and reliance on patients' memory about NDE  makes clear interpretation of the study difficult. He concludes: 'Perhaps the  switching of classification of patients represents nothing more than changes in  definition of NDE at different stages of the study. This possibility may receive  some support from the fact that, at the 2-year follow-up, over a third of the 17  patients who had originally reported superficial NDEs were then deemed to not  have had NDEs at all. Another possibility is ordinary forgetting. Such problems  must be rectified in future studies because their overall effect would be to  blur the distinction between NDE and non-NDE-patients. This overlap would make  it much more difficult to identify possible physiological and psychological  differences between the groups.'
