I left my body instantly. I was hovering above my body watching myself getting shocked with no fear but a strong sense of peace and love. I knew I was in God's presence. I asked Him telepathically, 'wow this is it huh? This is how I am going to die?' Then boom. 

I was back in my body, flopping around until power resided. I was able to go to the hospital. The doctor said I should be dead or have major organ damage, but nothing. It's been four years and no damage. I went from 95% faith to 100% faith and have a close relationship with the Lord. He still gives me that intense love feeling, that's how I know he is with me.
