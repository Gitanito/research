INTRODUCTION.
The object of the following pages is to present to
the Public a few plain Facts, with a selection of Cases,
by which they may be enabled to form an opinion of
the good already effected through Mesmerism.
When it is considered, that in the majority of cases,
Mesmerism is only resorted to as a last resource,
frequently, without any belief in its powers by the
patient—and almost always in direct opposition to the
advice, feelings, and opinions of the ordinary medical
attendants,—an attentive observer cannot but be struck
and surprised to find, that so much should have been
already accomplished.
To extend these benefits, should he the desire of all
this will be best accomplished by making known the
subject, and, on all occasions, giving a fair and im-
partial consideration to the enquiry.

As a practical remedy in disease, Mesmerism ought
to be confined to the members of the Profession; but
owing to their present supineness, relief must be sought
in many instances from those whose zeal and assiduity
may have led them to its application.

a potent remedy, because the Professors of the healing

ADDRESS.
Mesmerism, Animal or Vital Magnetism, Vital
Electricity, or by what other name known, has of
late engaged so much of both public and private
attention, as to make it a subject of the deepest
interest, whether considered in relation to the highly
curious phenomena developed, or in its more im-
portant application as a remedy in disease. It is to
this point, that I wdsh to confine myself, and shall
therefore refer only to those topics which are more
immediately connected with this enquiry ; in doing
this, however, it will be necessary briefly to men-
tion those circumstances which have hitherto most
retarded its progress. There cannot be a doubt, but
that the greatest opposition to Mesmerism has arisen
from the Medical Profession; let us therefore en-
quire upon what grounds their judgment has been
formed. In the ordinary pursuits of life, we gene-

rally consider individuals most qualified to give
an opinion, in proportion to the time and labour
tliey may have bestowed on any particular sub-
ject. But in regard to Mesmerism, the very re-
verse of this has been allowed ; for it is notorious,
that as a body, medical men have refused to inves-
tigate,—they have condemned unheard,—some have
declared that they would not believe the evidence
of their own senses, and others have endeavoured
to cast ridicule and contempt on every one who has
had the abihty, honesty, or courage, to carry out
the enquiry for himself.
If proofs were wanting, I could give many ; but
let us take a well known example. What has been
the treatment of Dr. EUiotson by the Profession?
Is he not considered by his most obstinate opponents
to be a man of science in the highest sense ? and are
not medical men more indebted to Dr. EUiotson
than to any other li\ing English physician, for the
most important and practical additions to the philo-
sophy and science of medicine ? Let us refer to a
few. Has not Dr. EUiotson advocated Phrenology,*
in liis lectures on the practice of medicine, his
clinical lectures, and his writings for above 20 years ?
* The London Phrenological Society was established chiefly by
Dr. EUiotson 20 years since. At that time there was hardly more
than one medical man in twenty a believer; now there is scarcely
a well educated medical man who does not admit its general prin-
ciples—many its minutise.

as practical means in their several applications
and though last, not^ least, follows Mesmerism,
which, of all, promises to be the greatest boon to
suffering humanity. Yet in the promotion of this,
how unfairly—nay, cruelly—has he been treated
though, before very long, he will have the proud
gratification of seeing Mesmerism, like all his pre-
vious labours, acknowledged, if not practised, by the
very men who have hitherto denied and ridiculed.
The Professionf ought to have been doubly
guarded in thus acting ; for the public know full
well, this has been their ordinary way of treating
* When the Stethoscope and quinme were introduced some
years since, a now fashionable Court physician used to say, that
the Stethoscope was just the thing for Elliotson to rave ahout, and
that quinine would not last twelve months. This same individual,
at the present time, never goes to a bed side without tlie one, and
rarely passes a day without prescribing the other.

every new discovery, and will ask, whether the same
Profession, did not thus condemn the discoveries of
Harvey, Hunter, and Jemier. Medical men must
however, before long, investigate, or they will
soon find their legitimate province invaded by those
who have less title ; those who believe, must soon
declare themselves, and those who vdll not examine,
camiot justly be entitled to give an opinion.
The public, however, are now so impressed by
the good already accomphsheJ by Mesmerism, that
they will be too happy to have its benefits extended
to all those cases which have hitherto baffled medical
skill ; and are there not too many diseases to which
the present state of science is quite unequal ? I
ask the question fearlessly and honestly of medical
men, of what avail or certainty are their remedies
in many cases of Paralysis, Epilepsy, St. Vitus's
Dance, Tic Douloureux, Hysteria, Mental, Spinal,
and other affections of the Nervous System ? Are
they not the very opprobium of the healing art ? and
are they not too often, especially among the poorer
classes, made the causes of exclusion from some of
our pubKc hospitals ? If, then, there be a power,
which will reheve and cure many of these extreme
cases, is it not the duty of medical men to investi-
gate that powder, instead of denying its facts and
condemning unheard ?
Observe the example set us by our Continental
every new
discovery, and will ask, whether the same
Profession, did not thus condemn the discoveries of
Harvey, Hunter, and Jenner. Medical men must
however, before long, investigate, or
they will
soon find their legitimate province invaded by those
who have less title; those who believe, must soon
declare themselves, and those who will not examine,
cannot justly be entitled to give an
opinion.
The public, however, are now so
impressed by
the good already accomplished by Mesmerism, that
they will be too happy to have its beneits extended
to all those cases which have hitherto baflled medical
skill; and are there not too many diseases to which
the present state of science is quite unequal? I
asl; the question fearlessly and honestly of medical
men, of what avail or
certainty are their remedies
in many cases of Paralysis, Epilepsy, St. Vitus's
Dance, Tic Douloureux, Hysteria, Mental, Spinal,
and other affections of the Nervous System? Are
they not the very opprobium of the healing art? and
are they not too often, especially among the poorer

our
public hospitals? If, then, there be a
power,
which will relieve and cure many of these extreme
cases, is it not the duty of medical men to investi-
gate that power, instead of denying its facts and
conderrming unheard?
Observe the example set us
by our Continental
brethren. In Frcancc, the late Commission of 1831
composed of men of the highest scientific cliaracter,
declared, that the facts of Mesmerism were unde-
niable, and entitled it to rank among the sciences;
and in Paris, at the present time, every fourth
medical man is a Mesmerist. Throughout the Con-
tinent, its reception has been equally gratifying.
In Germany, it is studied and practised to a consi-
derable extent ; in Prussia, many physicians make
use of it under the authority of government ; in
Berlin, the greatest success has attended its use; in
Stockholm, degrees are granted in the University
by an examination into its laws; in Russia, the
Emperor appointed a Commission of medical men
to enqmre into it: this Commission pronounced it
" a very important agent," and the first physician to
the Emperor, with many others at Petersbm-gh and
Moscow, have employed it successfully for years
in Denmark, physicians practise it under a royal
ordinance, by a decree of the College of Health ; in
Holland, the first men adopt it. Let us hear also
the opinions of two of the greatest of the Conti-
nental philosophers. La Place says, " that the
testimony in favour of the ti'uth of Mesmerism,
coming with such uniformity from enlightened men
of many nations, who had no interest to deceive,
and possessed no possible means of collusion, was
such, that, applying to it, his own principles and

brethren. ln France, the late Commission of' 1831,

possible means of collusion, was
such, that, applying to it, his own
principles and
10
formulas respecting human e\'idence, he could
NOT WITHHOLD HIS ASSENT FROM WHAT WAS SO
STRONGLY SUPPORTED."
Cuvier also writes, that "it is no longer per-
mitted us to doubt, that the proximity of two
animated bodies in a certain relation, and with the
help of certain motions, do produce a real effect,
wholly independent of the imagination of either."
Let us also see, what has been done in our own
country; though little, still, we have reason to re-
joice, and, uniting the labours of all, we may say,
without fear of contradiction, that Mesmerism can
claLEQ amongst its advocates and behevers, the
highest in rank, science, and literature. As names,
especially in this country, do too frequently influ-
ence us ; to prove my assertion, and to give encou-
ragement to doubters, let us mention a few of those,
who have expressed their belief in Mesmerism, many
of whom practise it. In science, can any names

attainments: indeed, the Clergy have done much,
and would do more, were it not, that there appears
to be an opinion abroad, that ^Mesmerism has an irre-

by the Rev. Hugh Mc. Neile. He has partly dis-

In the legal profession we have barristers of high
standing; alnongt others Basil Montague. In the
Church we have dignitaries of the highest order;
and three excellent \'orl;s on Mesmerism have been
lately written by Cll?1'§I}'1llC1l, of good standing and
attainments: indeed, the Clergy have done much,
and would do more, were it not, that there appears
to be an
opinion abroad, that Mesmerisnx has an irre-
ligious or Satanic agency. This beliefhas oliginated
chiefly from a Sernlon, said to have been preached
by the Rev. Hugh Mc. Neile. He has partly dis-
avowed the production, but 110t entirely; and so
far, renders himself responsible for those, who
choose only to act and think through the prejudices
of others.

Prince Albert stated before a large party at the Palace, only
a mouth ago, "That the incvlical men of this country were con-
ducting themselves in a
very improper manner, by refusing to in-
vestigate the facts presented to them by the scicncc of Mcsxncrisnn."
12
Yet on this point, can any objection be more irre-
ligious or uncharitable ? We will see. It is the
universal belief of every well regulated mind, and
ought certainly to be that of every Christian, that
whatever has been created, or exists, is for a wise
and benevolent purpose. It is very true, that we
do not always perceive the application, but that
does not destroy the power, and ought not to lessen
the value.
Now, when we find Mesmerism being applied
to the relief of the most hopeless of cases and
sufferers, and when good is effected, this must na-
turally dispose the mind to contemplate in a still
higher degree, the additional blessing received, and,
as a consequence, gratitude from the receiver—to
the Giver of all Good. Such benefits rather tend
to convert an unbeliever, and confirm a Christian.
Several objectors will be answered by the record
of cases given; but there are others, who, after
actually seeing certain benefits derived, then assume
the results to be merely the efforts of nature, the
force of imaguiation, or even imposition. Xow,
if the efforts of nature set in, after all other means
have been tried in vain, and the good only appears
to follow, from the time Mesmerism has been com-
menced, why not accord to it this slight credit?
and as regards the imagination, if several of the
most fearful and painful operations—such as tlie

of the jaw, the opening of tumours, and the extrac-

many more, can be effected ^s-ithout pain, and even
through the imagination, then, it becomes the
absolute duty of the College of Physicians to admit
this agent at once into the number of their remedies.
On the prejudices of medical men, Miss Marti-
neau has most tritely remarked in her interesting
letters,
—" How can the Profession hold its domi-
nion over minds, however backed by law, and the
opinion of the educated, when the vulgar see and
know that limbs are removed \s'ithout pain, in
opposition to the vsill of doctors, and in spite of
their denial of the facts ? What avails the decision
of a whole College of Surgeons, that such a thing
could not be, when a whole town fuU of people
know that it was ; which must succumb, the
learned body or the fact?''
There is no excuse for medical men not making
the enquiry for themselves, inasmuch as the appeal
is simply to nature, and is within the reach of every
one,—and when men are found, who will not
investigate, and prefer condemning unheard, let
them, however high their assumed character or
station, consider how just is the following, from
the late ^Ir. Chevenix, who on tliis very subject
was so able an advocate :

peared to him ? surely, what great men believe,

Mr. Chevenix further observes—" In the whole

upon experiments more numerous, more positive,
or more easily ascertained; and, to him, and before
long, the opinion must be universal, the most ex-
traordinary event in the whole history of human
science is, that Mesmerism ever could be

opinions are not those of a mere book worm, or
crude theorist; for, on referring to his writings,

actions, it will be seen, that he personally operated

it is not expecting too much, that, when opponents
to Mesmerism arise, they at least, should bring
facts against facts, well knowing, as they ought, that

which, by an over dose, would destroy life. Look
at Chemistry, and one of its applications—steam.
We wondered, when the first steam vessel was pro-
posed; and ridiculed, when told we might by the
same power, travel by land 30 miles in the hour
but even this was in its infancy, since, we now double
that speed, and by the electric telegraph, a corres-

of miles, in as many seconds of time. If matter

perceive.
Newton's humility of mind into enquiries of this
nature affords us another beautiful example. Dr.
Chalmers, in illustrating this point in his character,
says, " that he wanted no other recommendation for
any one article of science than the recommendation
of truth: with this, he would open to it all the ave-
nues of his understanding, though authority might
scowl upon it; and taste be disgusted by it; and
fashion be ashamed of it; and all the beauteous

To those who will not believe in Mesmerism until
we can explain causes, we refer to a paragi'aph
from the Rev. Mr. Sandby's excellent work, and
with which I shall now conclude :
" Gravitation is perhaps of all powers the most
universal ; and the best understood ; but who can
explain this ? We see the stone fall to the ground,
and the smoke rise above ; the storm rushes by, and
the mountain torrent dashes over the precipice into
the gulf below. But of the causCf of all these
various and apparently opposite effects, we know
nothing—but that the power is simple and uniform
it is named attraction—a sympathy between bodies,
but which is no explanation.
"It is the same with the phenomena of animal
life, which we perceive through the action of Mes-
merism, the results of which are uiiifonn under
similar conditions, but vary with all the changes
observable in the living body; and so far as we
are acquainted with these changes, can we calculate
upon the result of mesmeric action ; and it is the
same with the effects which follow in the course of
every other power by which the living body is
influenced. The laws of action are but the recog-
nised material conditions under w^hich any effects

SELECTION OF CASKS
In recording the following Cases, I have selected
tliose, which appear to have the greatest amount
of importance, in reference to the actual disturbed
conditions, previous to Mesmerism being adopted,
and to the general authentic character of the reports.
I have also preferred those cases to w^hich the names
of parties are affixed, and otherwise well attested.
In the cases taken from the Zoist,* it must be
understood, that I have selected only one or two,
as illustrating the particular diseases treated of,
there are numerous similar cases, reported by a
variety of medical men in difierent parts of the
country. My difficulty has been in the selection
from such a variety, as there are many others

Mesmerism ; it contains a great number of the worst description

I have purposely omitted any detailed reference
to my own experience, though I will just add, that
I have succeeded beyond my most sanguine ex-

violent Hysteria, Tic Douloui'eux, and other ner-

all the ordinary means of routine practice. I have
also been requested by one or two parties not to
report their cases, chiefly owing to the local preju-

remedy these drawbacks, when I shall be enabled
to give the results of several interesting cases, some
of them still under treatment and progressing
favourably.

has been a most extensive mesmeriser, was the
operator on this occasion. Mrs. Ra}Tnond, a lady
residing at Chehnsford, had suffered for nine years
from a spinal complaint, being coMCned to her sofa.

to be moved from my sofa night or day, I was never
free from pain; sometimes the agony was inde-
scribable : the last three years I have been entirely
speechless. I had given up all hope of recover}-,
and almost prayed for death. At the very time
that I had resigned myself to my fate, and begged
that my sufferings might soon be ended, God, in
his great mercy, made me acquainted with Captain
Anderson, who offered to try the effect of mesme-

of the cures he had performed, I complied, being
anxious to grasp at anything which would do me
good. Without follo^\'ing out the details, this is
the result. I am now able to walk out daily alone
and unassisted. I am regaining my speech ; and I
am free from pain, sleep soundly, and take no
medicine, and am now seldom mesmerised." Well

much respected, when comparing " her past suffer-

"feels thankful to God and grateful to Captain
Anderson."

Case of Uterine Disease, loith general Nervous
Derangement,
For the following interesting case, I am in-
debted to Mr. Vernon, of the Institute of Mesme-
rism, London; a gentleman, whose lectures and
demonstrations have done much towards diffusing
the knowledge of the science :
" Sir,—At Mr. Vernon's request, I send you
some account of the good resulting from the appli-
cation of mesmerism in my own case, after an ill-
ness of 5 years. I have suffered from an internal
complaint of a very painful and aggravated nature,
partly originating from an adverse circumstance at
the birth of an only child. I experienced little or
no relief from surgical aid during the period I have
mentioned. A detailed account of the many years
duiing which my health has slowly but surely de-
chned, would be unnecessary ; I will but briefly
explain my state when forced to apply to mesme-
rism for relief, as my last resource. I unfortu-
nately met with a severe accident in the begiiming
of last March, in consequence of which my com-
plaint was so much aggravated, that in the course
of a few weeks I was entirely confined to the sofa.

Sir,-At Mr. Vernon's request, I send you
some account of the good resulting from the appli-
cation of mesmerism in 1ny own case, after an ill-
ness of 5 years. I have suffered from an internal
complaint of a
very Painful and aggravated nature,
partly originating from an adverse circumstance at
the birth of an
only child. I experienced little or

mentioned. A detailed account of the many years
dtuing which my health has slowly but surely de-
clined, would be unnecessary; I will but briefly
explain my state when forced to apply to mesme-

nately met with a severe accident i11 the beginning
of last March, in consequence of which my com-
plaint was so much aggravated, that in the course
of a few weeks I was
entirely confined to the sofa.
I was attended by Mr. R. Tayler, of 27, Old Steine,
2:3
Brighton, and Dr. G. Hall, H, Old Steinc. Mi'.
Taylor's reputation is too high in Brighton for mc
to doubt that his treatment of nic was otherwise
than judicious. I believe that all was done for me
that surgical skill could do, notwithstanding wliich,
each week, almost each day, saw mc worse, until 1
was unable to walk, or even move, without the
greatest pain. From June last until the end of
November, I was leeched every fourth day, yet I
experienced little or no relief from this, or any other
treatment ; my sufferings were incessant and ago-
nizing. I was only enabled to bear them by
frequent and large doses of morphine and other
sedatives, wliich, together with the pain, produced
an equally distressing effect on the mind. The
events of that period are too indistinct and too
painful for me to recall ;
you will understand the
probable mental condition of one whose physical
strength was exhausted, and nerves rendered weak
and irritable by long continued suffering, and the
remedies taken to relieve them. My mother was
frequently told by Mr. Tayler *
that he knew not
tuhat to do for me; that I must trust to time and
to the advantages which I derived from my age *
(25).
This declaration was repeated only two days before
I was mesmerisedy when I was confined to my
bed, and felt my strength fiiiling rapidly, so that I
could not endure much longer. I freely confess
23
Brighton, and D1'. Cr. Hall, 14, Old Steine. Mr.
Tayler's reputation is too high in Brighton for me
to doubt that his treatment of me was otherwise
than judicious. I believe that all was done for me
that surgical skill could do, notwithstanding which,
each week, almost each day, saw me worse, until I
was unable to walk, or even move, without the
greatest pain. From June last until the end of
November, I was leeehed every fourth day, yet I
experienced little or no relief from this, or any otl1er
treatment; my sufl`erings were incessant and ago-
nizing. I was
only enabled to bear them by
frequent and large doses of morphine and other
sedatives, which, together Vltl1 tl1e pain, produced
an
equally distressing eifect on the mind. The
events of that period are too indisti11ct and too
painful for me to recall; you will understand the
probable mental condition of one whose Iihysical
strength was exhausted, and 11CFVOS rendered weak
and irritable by long continued suffering, and the
remedies taken to relieve tl1e1n. My mother was
frequently told by Mr. Tayler
'
that /ze knew not
what to do for me; that I must trust to time and
to the advantages wl1icl1 I derived from llly age
'
This declaration was
repealed only two days before
I was mesmerised, Vl1C11 l was confined to my
bed, and 'felt my strength failing rapidly, so that l
could not endure much longer. 1 freely confess
24
that had I not been so hopeless of relief, I would
not have applied to mesmerism from the fact of
the prejudice and ridicule attending it. I will only
premise that I believed in the poiver, but I did not
beheve the possibility of its efficacy in my case.
" On the evening of the 4th of December, 1844,
Mr. Vernon mesmerised me. When he arrived, I
was in extreme pain, and in a state of excessive
irritability and restlessness, so that I did not believe
it possible for me to lie still to allow Mr. V. to
make the attempt; notwithstanding which, after
what appeared to me to be a very short time, I
felt that the pains moderated, and a sensation of
ease and freedom from restlessness steal over me,
which no opiates could ever induce. I soon lost all
consciousness, and on waking, was ahnost free from
pain. That night I was far calmer than I had been
for many months, although the pains retm'ned.
Mr. Vernon continued to mesmerise me twice a
day, with one or two exceptions ; at the end of a
week I found myself enjoying several hours quiet
and refreshing sleep at nights. After a fortnight's
mesmerising, I discontinued the opiates which T
had regularly taken for many months, and was able
to walk about the room without much inconvenience
and at the end of three weeks I found sleep, appe-
tite, and strength of body and mind restored to a
degree which astonished no one so much as myself.

My mother, by wliose advice and persuasion I first
determined to try mesmerism, removed with me
to London in order to perfect my cure, which object
has been most happily and decidedly accomplished

without fatigue or inconvenience, as a proof of

Case of Nervous Suffering, leaving the patient Dumb,

bodily and mental suffering, leaving the patient
Dumb, until mesmerism was applied, deserves to be
made known ; the facts were thus recorded in the
"North Devon Journal":

The girl is in her 15th year, her name Catharine
Brown; and is the daughter of a mechanic, living
at Compass hill, Ilfracombe. Her mother states
that she was taken alarmingly ill in the mouth of
October, l84l; her complaint lying in her head,
side, and stomach. At this time, she presented a
most deplorable picture of human wretchedness and
suffering, and her screams, which were terrific, could
be heard at a
very considerable distance. She could
never be left for a moment, as, during the absence
of the attendants, she would beat her head against
27
a wall most iiiiinorcifuUy, so as to leave wounds as
well as bruises ; she was likewise often convulsed,
durinpj which paroxysms, it was as much as two
could do to hold her. Many medical gentlemen of
the town visited her, and gave her medicine; in
fact, she was an object of general charity, and, 1
believe, there was not even an occasional medical
visitor in the town who did not prescribe for her.
" After a lengthened period of duration and suf-
fering, the violence of her complaint greatly sub-
sided, but left her dumb ! From that period up to
the time of being first mesmerised, she had never
spoken a single syllable, although bribes had been
offered her in order to induce her to try and do so.
She still continued the object of charitable visits
from the town, among whom was — Lee, esq., a
magistrate, who offered her money to pronounce
his name ; but even this monosyllable she was
unable to articulate.
" After being mesmerised three times, and as
soon as consciousness was wholly destroyed, she
began to speak ; but at first her speech was slow,
and she dwelt on the first letter of the word just as
those persons do who have an impediment in their
speech, commonly known as stammering: thus, on
pronouncing the word cat, she dwelt on the c, as
c-c-c-at; dog, d-d-d-og, &c. &c. ; and in a similar
manner was her pronunciation of other monosylla-

the Abbey parish in St. Albans, who formerly
drove the mail cart from thence to Watford. For
a short time this poor girl gained her Kvehhood by
working in a silk factory: from the scrofulous habit
of her constitution, and being subject to epileptic
fits, she was not always equal to full employment
and, in 1837, when she was only sixteen years of
age, she was compelled to give up work altogether,
to go home and nurse a sick mother, who was also
suffering from a scrofulous affection, under which
she gi'adually sunk. The mother's disease had
taken strong hold of the daughter, for the over-
wTOUght exertions of a twelvemonth had now too
clearly brought out the hereditary taint. Anne
Vials, in fact, required a nurse for herself; for not
only was the general state of her health broken
down, but the left arm, which, for three or four
years had been giving her much pain and uneasi-
ness, became now in so diseased a condition as to-
tally to deprive her of its use. She was placed

nine months; thence to St. Thomases, in the Bo-
rough; and thence to Hemel Hempstead again,
in none of which places did she obtain any effectual
benefit. The state of her health at length became
so serious, that to save her life, some decisive mea-
sures were necessary; and she was taken up to
London again, to Guy's Hospital, where her arm
was amputated by Mr. Morgan, the 22d of March,
1841. At the end of tliree months, when the
wound was healed, she returned back to St. Albans.
After she had been at home some little time, a
violent convulsive action commenced in the stump.
This movement became rapidly worse and worse ; in
fact, the stump moved up and down, night and day,
unceasingly, and much quicker, to use her own ex-

Her sufferings became intense, and her general
health was affected in proportion. She was now
removed backwards and forwards, as before, to the

three or four'iits in a
day, ofa most violent nature,

which continued for more than an liour; the stunip
moved up and down without cessation, not a
merely nervous twitching, but violently up and
down. She suffered continuous excruciating pain
in the head and back ; and at the end of the stump
too, the pain was most agonising. She had pain
too in all her limbs and joints, particularly in the
elbow of the remaining arm, just as she had before
amputation in the other. Masses of sores were con-
stantly breaking out in different parts of the body
palpitations at the heart, pains in the chest, suspen-
sions of the functions of nature, and a spitting of
large quantities of blood, accompanied by solid
matter, were some of the other symptoms. In
short, a more terrible complication of evils have
seldom been united in one sufferer.' At the first
few sittings the epileptic fits were brought on, as
if by the mesmeric effect ; but this prevented their
recurrence in their ordinary way. At the fourth
or fifth seance the deep sleep, or trance, was super-
induced, when the action of the stump suddenly
stopped, and from that moment it never moved in
that way again; the fits too ceased; the pains in
the back of her head were almost instantly reUeved
and a gradual improvement in her general health
set in. Upon the wonderful results of the mesmeric
treatment in this case, I shall make little comment

sufferings, the amputation, the movement of the
stump, and the other attendant evils are known to
numbers—to medical men in St. Alban's, and to
the surgeons and nurses at the hospitals ; and it is
also known, that all the remedies suggested for her
benefit were fruitless : the best surgical advice was
of no avail ; but the fifth day, after the application
of mesmerism, the stump ceased to move, and the
other fearful symptoms of the case began to dis-
appear ! Mesmerism was perseveringly continued
when intermitted at one period, she relapsed.
Mesmerism was renewed, and in her case, shewed
all the higher manifestations of its powers; when
she was finally restored to perfect health—a blessing
to herself, and the utmost gratification to those
most interested in her welfare."

most interested in her welfare."
Case of Spasmodic Asthma of long szfanding,
The following case was treated by Mr. Kiste, a
gentleman who has devoted much attention to the
subject, and published an
interesting pamphlet
under the title of "
Facts against Fallacies." This
case is attested by the Rev. Mr. Holdsworth, who
is one of the Prebends of Exeter, and Vicar of
35
Brixhaiu in the same diocese; this gentleman, in ;!
published letter, authorises Mr. Kiste to add his
notes.
The patient, Elizabeth Spurdens, is wife of tiie
footman in Mr. Holdsworth's family, a female above
the middle age of life, whose sufferings for many
years have been intense, and by the simple appli-
cation of mesmerism has been restored to perfect
health. Previously, she had been under the care
of several medical men in her locality, who pro-
nounced her case incurable, and of the worst possi-
ble character. The Rev. Mr. Holdsworth thus
writes to Mr. Kiste, the operator:
" According to your wish I send you a copy of
the notes taken at the time when you favoured us
with yoiu' company and mesmerised the wife of my
footman—an operation which so far has been of
most essential service to her. The asthma under
which she has so long suffered was of a most dis-
tressing character ; so much so, that her neighbour
who inhabits a part of the house, I am informed,
was afraid to remain wdth her alone in the house,
unless her husband or some friend of her's was
there also, so frightful was her appearance when
under the attack. You know already that for six
weeks after she was put under mesmeric influence
she had no attack; then a slight one, brought on,
she says, by her own imprudence, and from that

and Mr. Kistc concludes the case with the I'ollow-

" It should here be mentioned, that about six
weeks after the time of her mesmeric slumbers, she
caught cold and the symptoms of her disease made
their appearance, but her altered constitution evi-
dently did not seem to admit of any intrusion of
her former complaint ; in a letter to me respecting
it she says,
—' It came on in the morning, but I did
not get ill until between 1 1 and 12 in the forenoon
in the evening there were preparations made as usual,
and a person sent for, to stop the night, but to my
great surprise and to the utter astonishment of all, I
got better before night, and didnot require any assist-
ance during the night, but slept soundly, and had
but one spasm during the day; before now in that
time, I may have had a dozen.' About three weeks
after this I saw her and mesmerised her for several
days, during which time the faculty of clairvoyance
was often spontaneously developed. A year has
now elapsed, and she has uniformly enjoyed her
health. When seeing her lately, she said to me
in her simplicity, that frequently when sitting by
herself she would look back to former years and
fancy she could not be the same person.

to sleep ; and when aware of her improved state of
health, she constantly imagined she would have a
return of her illness ; and I strongly beheve that,
even at this monent, she is not free from that appre-
hension. But considering the time, and her having
had some severe colds, which generally brought on
violent attacks, reason and facts combine to decide
in favour of the cure being a perfect one ; and I have
only to add, had this been the only case in which
I have been able to accomphsh a cure, I should

This lady has related her case i_n a.

For eighteen years she suffered from neuralgia of
the heart, and was
successively under the care of
39
Dr. Warren, Sir C. Bell, Mr. Abernethy, Dr.
Maton, and Dr. Elliotson; but the various reme-
dies which were suggested did not in the least re-
lieve her. At this period, 1834, she was taking
forty grains of opium a day. Her sufferings con-
tinued unalleviated till the end of last year, 1844,
when she was fortunately introduced to Mr. Kiste.
" The Lady writes—' On the 16th of Sept. last,
we had some friends to dinner, amongst whom was
Mr. Kiste, who is an amateur mesmerist, and has been
successful in curing diseases which had baffled the
skill of medical men. He expressed a wish to tiy his
power ; but as our friend Mr. B., Mons. Lafontaine,
and Dr. Ashburner had failed to produce the sleep, 1
sat down with the idea that I could not be affected by
mesmerism ; he sat before me earnestly and steadily
gazing in my eyes. In a few minutes I felt a most
unusual tranquillity of mind; the objects in the
room seemed to lose their outline ; and the last
thing I remember having seen were my mesmeriser's
eyes. I was afterwards told, that in eight minuteis
I sank dovm in the arm-chair, and that Mr. K. pro-
nounced me to be in what is called mesmeric som-
nambulism, a peculiar state of the nen'ous system.
After nearly two hours' sleep, Mr. K. awoke me,

months I have twice had occasion to have my dresses
much diminished, and I am now able to walk five
or six miles without the least fatigue.

Having been for nearly two months free from
my usual sufierings, Mr. Kiste proposed to me to
diminish my doses. Although I thought this an
impossibility, I made the trial, when I found I did
not as formerly feel the loss. I continued by de-
grees to lessen the quantity, and from having at that
time been in the habit of taking from sixty-six to
upwards of eighty-six grains daily, I have now re-
duced it to considerably less than thirty, and I am
going on to diminish the quantity.

mother as most deplorable, and one in which every
other mode of treatment had been tried and found

nothing more than the common reports on the sub-

from its employment; but that they proposed to

I was informed that the young lady had for

above two years been entirely out of health,
suffering acute and capricious pains in the head,
teeth and face, after the slightest exposure to cold,
and pains at the pit of the stomach after every meal
that about six months previously she had had an
attack of brain fever : that from defective capillary
circulation she was always shivering from cold, and
her countenance had assumed a perfectly exsangui-
neous aspect : that she suffered so much depression
of spirits as rendered life a burden : and that for
the last fourteen weeks she had been attacked every
night by a pain extending over the right side of the
head down to the shoulder, lasting for about five
hours, and so acute as nearly to deprive her of reason.

lady experienced a sense of warmth which she had
not felt for months,—the first night, the agonising

weeks, wholly ceased, or was superseded by only a
slight uneasiness, continuing but five minutes in-

peared—and to the present time no sign of it has
ever returned. The general improvement of her
health is manifested by every indication of bodily
and mental vigour—at the end of six weeks the
dull heavy languor of long disease had given place
to the natural buoyancy of youth,—a colourless,
lack-lustre complexion was replaced by the genuine
hue of health,—the hair, which had nearly all fallen
off, not only grew rapidly in length, but sprang up
thickly over the whole head,—the appetite became

health and strength—^have been raised from the
couch of suffering and restored to their friends and
society—^have recognized the power by means of
which they have been healed, and promulgated
again and again their thanks ; but their tale has not
been heeded, or, if Kstened to for a moment, it was
soon forgotten, and they were ranked in the same
category with the nervous, the visionary, or the
insane. It is then in a great measure to the pub-
lication of Miss M.'s case that this sudden change
is to be attributed. From every quarter we hear of
extraordinary cures. We understand that even
medical men, some of them belonging to the Lon-
45
sufficient accuracy to cause him to quote fairly the
documents of a
past age, or chronicle the facts of
the present.
"
The immediate cause of all this activity is the
publication of the case of Miss Martineau, who,
after_/ive years of incessant suffering and confine-
ment to her couch, is now well; and we, knowing
the particulars from the first day of her illness to
the last day of her continuance of pills and mix-
tures, and from this period onwards day by day,
during the mesmeric treatment, as medical men,
unhesitatingly assert, that this cure has been accom-
plished by the aid of mesmerism alone. But Miss
l/I. is not the first person cured by this plan of
treatment. Ilumlreds and thousands have received
health and strength-have been raised from the
couch of sujfering and restored to their friends and
society--have recognized the power by means of
which they have 'been healed, and promulgated
again and again their thanks; but their tale has not
been heeded, or, if listened to for a moment, it was
soon
forgotten, and they were ranked in the same
category with the nervous, the visionary, or the
insane. It is then in a
great measure to the pub-
lication of Miss M.'s case that this sudden change
is to be attributed. From every quarter we hear of
ext1'ao1'dina.ry cures. Ve Luiderstand that even
medical men, some of them belonging to the Lon-
47
don phalanx of opponents, are daily requesting from
Dr. Elliotson interviews for themselves or their
friends. Yes, the medical butterflies are again
beginning to be attracted towards that centre, which
on former occasions afforded them light, and con-
tributed in no small degree towards the elevation
they now enjoy. And when they hear that Royalty
has given an opinion regarding the facts they have
so long neglected—when they hear that Royalty
recognizes a method of cure which they have for
so long a period sneered at, why then we shall really
dread the consequences; for the sudden change
from a state of wilful ignorance to an ardent desire
for knowledge—from the emplo}Tnent of promul-
gating calumnies, falsehoods and misrepresentations,
to the practice of the science they have so long ridi-
culed, must be considered a great revolution. May
they in their new position be guided by the dictates
of conscientiousness, and strive manfully to over-
come the petty promptings of mere animal impiilse.
" If it were possible for us to place before our rea-
dei*s the details of the prolonged sufferings endured
by ^liss Martineau, unalleviated by ordinar^• treat-
ment, we feel convinced that no unprejudiced me-

there, suddenly experienced the first symptoms of
her distressing malady. From this period till the
autum of 1838 her health gradually gave way. She
was not only conscious of this herself, but her de-
licate appearance alarmed her relations and friends,

49
took to convey an invalid cousin to Lucenic. Dur-
ing tlie journey her travelling companions were
painfully struck by her depression of spirits, and she
became conscious of an increasing inability to enjoy
anything ; in fact, the whole party became so
alarmed, that on their arrival at Venice, Dr. Nardo
was consulted, and a letter was despatched to Mr.
Greenhow containing a full detail of all her s}Tnp-
toms, After the consultation with Dr. Nardo, an
immediate return home was determined on. The
journey was made as easy as possible, and by the
end of July 1839, Miss M. was under the immediate
care of Mr. Greenhow.
" We shall now take the sufferer's own account
of her state from this period, July 1839, till Sept.
1841. Miss M. continued to take daily exercise
till the middle of October 1839, when her sufferings
from sickness, breathlessness and pain in the back,
made it too painful to be worth the cost. In
January 1840, all the symptoms had increased.
It was for some time impossible to raise the right leg
more than sufficient to permit walking, and through-
out the whole period she could bear none but a re-
cumbent posture from the intolerable sinking which
attended every effort to sit upright. She could not
sleep at night till she devised a plan of sleeping
under a basket, for the purpose of keeping the
weight of the bed-clothes from her body, and even

weight of the bed-clothes from her body, and even
50
then only in a prone position. She was scared by
horrors all night, and reduced by increasing sickness
during the day. This sickness increased to such a
degree, that for two years she was extremely low
for want of food. A very small breakfast and tea
were nearly all she could take, and these only
through the operation of opiates to prevent the
vomiting. At the earnest desire of ]\Ir. G. and
her family, she repeatedly (four times) attempted
to take gentle exercise, but the pain, sinking, and
especially the vomiting that ensued, were such as
clearly to shew that the cost was too great for any
advantage gained.
" From this period the patient was placed under
the influence of iodide of iron, and this remedy
was continued for three years. The general
health improved, but the disease remained. In
January 1844, Mr. G. expressed his regret at being
compelled after so long a use of iodine, to give up
all hopes of its affecting the complaint, or of any-
thing beyond alleviation being henceforth practi-
cable. This opinion he again expressed in April
and also in June, 1844.

About this period, the beginning of June 1844,
the period be it remembered of Miss M.*s greatest
suffering, several friends wrote to her to suggest a
trial of mesmerism; and while her thoughts were
engaged on tliis subject, lo! Mr. Greenhow himself

then only in a
prone position. She was scared by

About this period, the beginning of June 1344,
the period be it remembered of 1Iiss M.'s greatest
suffering, several friends Wrote to her to suggest a
trial of rnesmerism; and while her thoughts were
engaged on this subject, lo! Mr. Greenhow himself
made his appearance on the 20th of the same month
—a fact, by the bye, which he most carefully avoids
stating in his pamphlet. They conversed on the
subject of mesmerism, and he promised to bring
Mr. Spencer Hall, who was then lecturing at New-
castle. On the 22nd of June, Messrs. Greenhow
and S. Hall visited Miss M. At this interview such
phenomena were produced, that Mr. Hall's \-isit
was repeated on the following day. On Monday,
the 24th of June, Mr. H. was prevented from keep-
ing his appointment, and Miss M. had recourse to
passes made by her own maid. We refer our
readers to her letters, for the detail of the future
progress.
" We must here remark that our intelligent and
benevolent friend, Mr. Atkinson, from hencefoi*ward,
directed the course to be pursued, and after a few
weeks, fortmiately enlisted the s}inpathy of his
friend, Mrs. Montagu Wynyard, jun., who imme-

energy, for the purpose of mesmerising an individual
she did not know, but solely influenced by a desire
to alleviate human suffering, we are sure that we

" As we have just said, the entire course pursued
by Mrs. Wynyard was indicated by Mr. Atkinson.
He received notes describing the progress made and
then gave directions accordingly, w^hich were im-

after the commencement of the mesmeric treatment,

was placed upon her back on an apparatus, under
the care of Mr. Thornber. But the epileptic fits
were so violent that the cure was prevented, and
Mr. Thornber wished to give up the case. She re-
required five people to hold her, and in spite of
them all, would turn round on her face. Mr. Carter,
now of Readmg, and then Mr. HaUion, mesmerised
her twice a week for six months.
" Her fits continued as frequent as before, but
were less violent, so that she did not require hold-
ing, and was not exhausted, as previously, on com-
ing out of them. She fell asleep when mesmerised
for a quarter of an hour.
" I mesmerised her in December, 1839, and she
w^ent to sleep the first time. I spoke to her and
she answered me, and proved to be in the deeper
sleep-waking, for she knew me and knew she was
asleep. I asked whether I should be able to cure
her: ^Yes.' I enquired, when ? * In four months.'
" Her attacks were numerous and in rapid suc-

came every other day for six months ; then once a

great pleasure in seeing an old patient of our's from
Camden Town, Miss Spong, who you may recollect

"

"
Three months previously he fell upon his left
59
side on the ice, and, thougli liis licad was not struck,
it was so shaken that he docs not know liow he got
home, remembering nothing between the fall and
his finding himself at home. As soon as he found
himself at home, he had repeated fits, decidedly
epileptic, so that many men could scarcely restrain
him ; and in four hours he was bled, and had no
more fits for a day or two. But afterwards the least
noise startled him, and caused a fit, even the sud-
den cough of a child. They were very frequent,
and each left him weak for an hour.
" That I might judge of their present frequency,
I enquired how many had occurred tliis month, and
found that there had been one on the 2nd, the 8th,
the 14th, and two on the 15th. I requested Mr.
Wood to mesmerise him for me, and he was mesme-
rised for half an hour daily, except on Sundays,
" He had no fit for a fortnight after mesme-
rism was begun. He then was frightened by a per-
son behind him saying he would be run over ; felt
ill,
—' felt the fits in him,' but had no fit till even-
ing, when, going up stairs in the dark, a cat jumped
out and he was instantly seized with a paroxysm.
It was very severe—stronger and longer than usual,
and he tried to bite in it, felt ill and stupid all
all night, and did not sleep.

Case o St. Vitus's Dance o nine '1 ears d11l`(Zff0I1.
J
Dr. Elliotson mentions the case ofa patient whom
he found labouring under a very severe form of St.
Vitus's dance of nine years duration. Dr. Marshall
Hall prescribed "mustard cataplasms to the spizze,
capping on the back of the nec/c EVERY FIFTH DAY,
and mercury to such an eactcizt that not one sound Ioolh
is left in the patienfs head." He treated the case for
t/Lree months, and wished to continue his plan for a
twelvemont/z. The friends, however, interfered, and
Sir Benjamin Brodie was consulted,
"
who con-
64
demned the treatment in the most unqualified man-
ner, declined to prescribe medicines, or to see the
patient again, and stated that nothing more could
be done than to endeavour, by every means, to
strengthen the debilitated frame." Dr. Hall, hov^^-
ever, wrote a letter, still in the possession of the
family, maintaining his opinion, and treating Sir
Benjamin Brodie's opinion most contemptuously.
On being consulted, Dr. EUiotson advised that, " as
mesmerism had been begun, it should be continued
rather than the case be abandoned ; though he en-
treated them not to be disappointed, if no good re-
sulted." And he adds, " For the last four months,
mesmerism has been daily persevered with ; and the
gradual but steady improvement in the strength, the
sleep, and looks of the patient, and the decline of
the disease, astonishes every one. Now that Dr.
Hall has learned the improvement by mesmerism,
he says that he all along (while cupping every five
days, and giving mercury freely, and proposing to
do all this for twelve months!) suspected, and is
noiv (mesmerism having done great good) perfectly
certain that the case was feigned ! I should like to
observe his countenance when he says so."

reports of cures of the same complaint in the practice
of Dr. Simpson of York, Mr. Prideaux of South-
ampton, and in other cases of his own. The case of

Master Linncll of Northampton, nine years of age,
had baflled a j^rcat number of medical men, when
at length application was made to Dr. Elliotson.
" On January 4th, 1843," says the Doctor, " he
was bi ought in a coach to me, and obliged to be
carried into the house. Supported by his motlier,
lie walked with great difficulty from my dining-
room into my library.
" His debility was such, that he could not stand
a moment unsupported; his head hung on one side;
his tongue out of his mouth, which constantly slob-
bered ; his look was quite fatuitous ; he could not
articulate, making only inarticulate noises, and these
with extreme difficulty; even *Yes' and *No' were
said in the strangest manner, so as hardly to be un-
derstood. He often fell into a passion at not being
able to articulate; he ground his teeth and sighed
greatly, continually blew bubbles of saliva from his
mouth, and moved his tongue. The movements of
the disease had lessened, so as not to be in propor-
tion to his extreme muscular debility. He could
use neither hand for any purpose, and scarcely ever
raised the right. He was low-spirited and fretful,
and often cried almost without cause.
" His tongue was clean and moist, his appetite
good, and his bowels in the most healthy condition

at length application was made to Dr. lilliotson.
"

"

was

"
He cried sadly at being brought to me, thinking
that I should give him loads of physic to swallow,
and blister him, as others had done.
" I mesmerised him by vertical passes before his
face for half an hour. He sat well supported in an
easy chair, his head on his breast; but he sat so
quietly in comparison with his usual state, that his
mother noticed it. He was mesmerised daily for the
same time in the same way."
Dr. Elliotson proceeds to narrate the progress of
the cure until the 15th of February, when the pa-
tient was mesmerised for the last time—and thus
concludes
" Nothing could be more decisive of the power of
mesmerism than this case. The disease was getting
worse and worse at the time I began. An effect
was visible in a few days ; the benefit steadily in-
creased—and from being a slobbering, idiot-looking
child, his head hanging on one side, miable to speak
or stand unsupported, in three weeks he could stand
easily, and walk five miles. Not a particle of me-
dicine was given after the first day.
" The true gratitude of the boy and his mother
was delightful. But my medical reward was, that
the surgeon who attended him, and whose very name
I had never before heard of, gave way to such bad
feeling as publicly to attack me, by reiterating a
silly and ignorant string of sentences from a very
dull and feeble medical periodical, but took care

The work of Mr. Braid, entitled Neurypnology,
contains accounts of a great number of highly in-
teresting cases. The phenomena induced by this
mode of producing sleep, and that of the Mesme-
risers, Mr. Braid, for a considerable time, conceived
to be identical, and he still believes " the condition
of the nervous system induced by both modes to be
at least analagous;" but he has latterly been led to
think that the agencies are distinct, because the
Mesmerisers assert that they can produce certain
effects which he has never been able to accomplish
by his mode. Pehaps, therefore, medical gentle-
men who had formed a determined resolution to
have nothing to do with Mesmerism, maybe tempted
to bestow a few minutes consideration upon the
merits of Neurypnology. They will meet in Mr.
Braid's volume with none of the ugly words which
used to form such stumbhng-blocks in their path.

merised they have hypnotised, meaning one who
has been put into the state of nervous sleep. These
changes will, we hope, please our medical friends,
and induce them to turn a favourable eye to the
cases which Mr. Braid has laid before tbem.
Hypnotism has been applied by Mr. Braid to
numerous diseases, and seemingly with great suc-
cess. He has tested its efficacy in cases where the
senses of hearing, sight, and smell were affected.
In tic-doloureux, spinal complaints, paralysis, rheu-
matism both chronic and acute, nervous head-ache,
epilepsy, and several other diseases, he bas also
found it highly beneficial. Several cases of spas-
modic affection are referred to as affording " strong
grounds to bope that tetanus, hydrophobia, and
other analagous affections, may be arrested and
cured by this agency." We extract the following
account of a
Case of Tetanus, or severe Spasmodic Affection.

attacked with chilliness and pain all over his body, on
the evening of the 30th of last March. I was called
to attend him the following day, when I considered
he had got a febrile attack from cold, and prescribed
accordingly. Next day, however, it had assumed a
very different aspect. I now found I had got a

has been put into the state of nervous
sleep. These
changes Will, vve
hope, please our medical friends,
and induce them to turn a favourable eye to the
cases which l[r. Braid has laid before them.
Hypnotism has been applied by hir. Braid to
numerous diseases, and seemingly with great suc-
cess. He has tested its efficacy in cases Where the
senses of hearing, sight, and smell were affected.
In þÿdC-dOlO].l' ¬l1X,
spinal complaints, paralysis, rheu-
maijsm both chronic and acute, nervous head-ache,
epilepsy, and several other diseases, he has also
found it highly benencial. Several cases of spas-
modic affection are referred to as
alfording
"
strong
grounds to hope that tetanus, hydrophobia, and
other analagous affections, may be arrested and
cured by this agency." We extract the following
account of a
Case of Tetanus, or severe
Spasrnodic Afection.
"
Master J. B., thirteen years of age, was
suddenly
attacked with chilliness and pain all over his body, on
the evening of the 30th of last March. I was called
w attend him the following day, when I considered
he had got a febrile attack from cold, and prescribed
accordingly. Next day, however, it had assumed a
very different aspect. I now found I had got a
severe case of opisthotonos* to deal with. The
head and pelvis were rigidly drawn back, the body
forming an arch, and the greatest force could not
succeed in straightening it, or bringing the head
forward. Whilst the spasm never relaxed entirely,
it frequently became much aggravated, when, the
head was so much drawn back as to seriously im-
pede respiration. The legs were also sometimes
flexed spasmodically. The effect of the spasm in
obstructing the respiration, and hurrying the circu-
lation, was very great, and seemed to place the
patient in great jeopardy. The pulse was never
less than 150, but during the paroxysm was consi-
derably increased. It was e^'ident I had got a most
formidable case to contend with, and that no time
ought to be lost. I therefore determined to trj- the
power of h^-pnotism, well knowing how generally
such cases end fatally under ordinary treatment.
He was quite sensible, and the only difficulty in
getting him to comply with my instructions arose
from the recurrence of the severe spasmodic attacks.
In a very few minutes, however, I succeeded in re-
ducing the spasm, so that his head could be carried
fonvard to the perpendicular, his breathing was re-
lieved, his pulse considerably diminished, and I left

him in a state of comparative comfort. In about
two and a half hours after I visited him again, ac-
companied by my friend Dr. Cochrane. The spasms
had recurred, but by no means with the same vio-
lence. Dr. Cochrane had no difficulty in recog-
nising the disease ; but did not believe any means
could save such a case. He had never seen a pa-
tient hypnotised till that afternoon, and watched my
experiment with much interest and attention. He
seemed much and agreeably surprised by the extra-
ordinary influence which an agency so apparently
simple exerted over such a case. The pupil was
speedily dilated, as if under the influence of bella-
donna ; the muscular spasm relaxed, and in a few
minutes he was calmly asleep. Having ordered
three calomel powders to be given at intervals, we
left him comfortably asleep. Next day there was
still spasm of the muscles, but by no means so severe.
Whilst I determined to follow up the hypnotic treat-
ment, which had been so far successful, I considered
it would be highly imprudent to trust wholly to that,
in the treatment of such a case. As I consider such
cases are generally attended with inflammation of
the medulla oblongata, and upper part of the spinal
cord, I bled him, and ordered the calomel to be
continued. The same plan was persevered in, hyp-
notising him occasionally for some days, administer-
ing calomel till the gums were slightly affected, cold

lotion to the head, and the antiphlogistic regimen,
till I considered all risk of inflammatory action past,
when he was treated more generously, and I am
gratified to say he is now quite well."
In conclusion, Mr. Braid remarks—" I feel quite
confident that without the aid of hypnotism, this
patient would have died. I sincerely wish it may
prove equally successful in other cases of the kind,
and also in that hitherto fatal disease hydrophobia.
My anxiety to see it fairly tried in the latter disease,
induces me to offer my gratuitous services in any
case of that disease occurring within a few hours'
journey of Manchester."
Another case of Spasmodic Affection—that of
Miss Collins of Newark—which led Mr. Braid to
think that his mode of treatment might prove suc-
cessful as in the case just quoted, is thus recorded
by the father of the patient:
" My daughter, sixteen years of age, had been
afflicted for six months with a rigid contraction of
the muscles on the left side of the neck to so great a
degree, that it would have been impossible to insert
an ordinary card between the ear and shoulders, so
close was their contact; and consequently she was
rapidly becoming malformed. She had had the best
7]
lotion to the head, and the antiphlogistic regimen,
till I considered all risk of inflammatory action past,
when he was treated more
generously, and I am
gratified to say he is now
quite well."

advice to be procured in the country, and I had
taken her to London with a ^vritten statement of the
treatment previously employed, and had the opinion
of Sir Benjamin Brodie, who approved of what had
been done, but gave no hope of speedy relief.
" In consequence of seeing a report of a lecture
given on the subject by Mr. Braid, sm-geon, St.
Peter's Square, Manchester, and a letter written to
that gentlemen by Mr. Mayo of London, I went
with her, by the advice of Dr. Chawner, who, in-
deed, accompanied us, and placed her under the care
of Mr. Braid, on Thursday evening, the 24th March
last, (1842.) In less than a minute after that gen-
tleman began to fix her attention she was in a
mesmeric (neurohypnotic) slumber, and in another
minute was partially cataleptic. Mr. Braid, then,
vdthout awaking her, and consequently without
giving her any pain, placed her head upright, which
I firmly beheve could not, by any possibility, have
been done five minutes before, without disruption
of the muscles, or the infliction of some serious
injury ; and, I am thankful to say, it not only con-
tinues straight, but she has the perfect control over
the muscles of the neck. A nervous motion of the
head, to which she had been subject after her return
from Manchester, has entirely ceased, and she is at
present in excellent health. It is necessary to re-
mark, that at Dr. Chawner's recommendation she

Mr. Braid subsequently adds:—"After the lapse

Mr. Braid gives reports of cases, amounting to
between sixty and seventy, in the various branches
of disease which w^e have enumerated, and which
we hope the Profession will have the candour to
receive, in the manner they merit, as coming from an
intelligent member of their own profession. It is
really time that the disgraceful, and, in some in-

men to mesmerism should cease. What, for ex-

following ?

"
I consider it necessary," says Mr. Braid, in his
preface, "to explain that my reason for having
inserted some cases attested by the patients. and
74
others, is, that most unwarrantable interferences
have been resorted to bv several medical men, in
order to misrepresent some of them. In one in-
stance, in order to obtain an attested erroneous do-
cument, the case was read to the patient, and
others presejit, the very reverse of what was
WRITTEN. However extraordinary such conduct
mav appear, the fact of its occurrence was publicly
proved and borne testimojiy to by the patient and
other parties present on the occasion when the docu-
ment was obtained."
Strange as such conduct may appear, yet it is
not unconunon. Every experienced Mesmeric
practitioner could bring forward many various il-
lustrations; thus some, as soon as mesmerism is
proposed or commenced, take every opportunity of
trying to weaken the &ith of the patient, though
no more confidence is really required, than what the
ordinarv attendant knows is necessary for any thing
he may himself prescribe ; others, will ridicule the
idea of any agency whatever, but should the least
thing unfavourable occur during the treatment,
then they change about, and unwittingly ascribe
the accidental occurrences to the injurious effects
of a power which they had previously denied.
Common prudence, if no higher motive, should
point out to medical men, that in all such in-

idea of any agency whatever, but should the least
thing uniavourable occur during the treatment,
then they change about, and unwittingly ascribe

higher motive, should
point out to medical men, that in all such in-

Surely it is for the honour of the profession that
such atrocious proceedings should be universally
scouted, and that the vilest of calumnies should no
longer be propagated in order to damage the cause

It was my intention, had space allowed, to have
given insertion to many other cases treated by
different medical gentlemen ; however, the sources
of this information are open in so accessible a fonn,

conclude the selection with a few, intended chiefly
to shew the efiicacy of Mesmerism, in Surgical
Operations without pain. Already tliese cases are
very numerous, and even if mesmerism never ac-
complished any thing more, tliis alone would en-
title it to the kindly consideration of every well
wisher to our species. How many operations have
been postponed until too late, in consequence of
75
opinion and confidence of their patients and the
family.

been postponed until too late, in consequence of
76
the dreaded pain ! and how many actually operated
upon, have sunk from the consequent irritation,
produced hy pain and fear ? Should this little work
fall under the eye of any Governors of Hospitals,
and other Charities, it is sincerely to he hoped,
that they will at once see the propriety of allowing
mesmerism a fair trial. They may be opposed most
probably by the medical officers ; but it is now time,
that the independent Governors should think and
act for themselves, on matters in which all are so
deeply interested, and in which every one who
takes the trouble, can form a competent opinion.
Independent of Surgical operations without pain,
there are also many other affections which can be
relieved, and oftentimes cured, by mesmerism. In
every Hospital there should be a Mesmeric Ward,
and then we should not find about our streets so
many distressed objects, suffering from fits and
other complaints, which have been discharged as
incurable. I have seen several of these cases, here
and elsewhere, and I do not hesitate to affirm, that
mesmerism would succeed in curing many. My re-

Case of Amputation of the Thigh without Pain.
On the 22d of November, 1842, the Royal Medi-
cal and Chirurgical Society of London were presented
with an " account of a case of successful amputation
of the thigh, during the mesmeric state, \Wthout the
knowledge of the patient," in the District Hospital
of Wellow, Nottinghamshire. The mesmeriser was
W. Topham, Esq., Barrister of the Middle Temple;
the operator, W. Squire Ward, Esq., surgeon, of
Wellow Hall. The patient was a labourer, six feet
high, and forty-two years of age, named James
Wombell. The details appeared in many of the
journals at the time, and it is therefore unnecessar}-
to repeat them. Those who are desirous of further
infonnation may consult a pamplilet by Dr. Elliotson,
entitled " Numerous Cases of Surgical Operations,
witliout Pain, in the Mesmeric State."
As usual, a report was soon circulated, that this
poor man had confessed he had been deceiving all
present, and had really suffered great pain ; tliis,
however, was flatly contradicted by the attestation
of the poor man himself, signed in the presence of
a clergpnan and Mr. Wai'd.

Two operations have within a few months been
performed at Leicester during the mesmeric state;
the last case, that of Mary Ann Lakin, has excited
E
78
mucli interest. She had been suffering from exten-
sive disease of the knee-joint, which became so
alarming as to render amputation necessary, even to
prolong her existence. The operation was per-
formed by ^Ir. Tosswell, surgeon ; the mesmeriser
was Mr. J. Collins. An eye-witness affirms, that
'•
she remained during the operation almost motion-
less, so that there was no occasion to support her
on the table, as is usual on these occasions." On
being put to bed and demesmerised, she was asked
what she had felt ? She said, " she had been dream-
ing that a person had tied something tightly round
her sound leg, and that she felt angry, and gave him
a kick to make him desist." Her features did not
change from the calmness first noted ; and the wit-
ness, a surgeon, concludes by saying, that " he be-
lieves and feels assured, that the girl by mesmerism,
has evaded the horrors of the operation."
A report here also, was raised by some medical
men, that the poor girl was an impostor. She was
ably vindicated by the Editor of the " Leicester
Chronicle," who had witnessed the case throughout,
and who concludes an interesting article by saying,

operation of mesmerism in the case of Mary Ann

letter addre§ed to Dr. Elliotson, describes the case
of a
patient who had a
great number of decayed
80
teeth and stumps, from which she suffered severely,
but who still could not summon resolution to un-
dergo their extraction. While in the mesmeric
sleep, and at various sittings, Mr. Prideaux ex-
tracted, in all, from the mouth of this patient,
eleven teeth and eleven stumps, the last being re-
moved preparatory to her being supplied with a set
of artificial teeth. During the sitting at w^hich two
of the most troublesome teeth were extracted, Mr.
Prideaux says, " The patient sat with the hands
quietly folded in the lap—the countenance was
placid and serene, and the whole attitude that of
repose." The other sittings were attended with
equally satisfactory results.
Mr. Prideaux mentions several other cases, and
he states, regarding one of these,
—" A fifth patient,
on w^hom I have operated during the mesmeric
state, is a young lady who required to have several
of her molares separated with a file, on accomit of
the commencement of decay, and one stopped. I
found her a most troublesome and restless patient,
in her natural state, shrinking when the cavity of
her tooth was touched, and complaining greatly of
the unpleasantness of the sensation of filing. I
succeeded in entrancing her at the first trial, in
about five minutes, and, in this state, she allowed
me to operate for two hours with the most passive
indifference, assuring me she felt nothing, except
S0
teeth and stumps, from which she suffered severely,
but who still could not summon resolution to un-
dergo their extraction. Wliile in the mesmeric

phrenology, and in others, who were not aware of the experi-

far superior to any thing that could be sunulated in the natural

evidence of our own senses; in truth, supposing it were collusion,

Phreno-Mesmerism, and the still higher condition, Clairvoynnce,
present themselves in some form or other during the mesmerie
treatment of many patients; indeed, those who have been much
engaged in enquiries of this nature, must have seen so many in-
stances of these higher manifestations, as to place beyond all doubt

ments being made, and the manifestations exhibited have been so
far superior to any thing that could be simulated in the natural
state, that to deny the existence of the phenomena is to doubt the
evidence of our own senses; in truth, supposing it were collusion,
the imposition would be far more surprising than the reality. To
Mesmerisers they are common results; to those who have only
seen an occasional case or two, they are staggering; and to those
who havc not witnessed anything, they are considered too \'onder~
ful to be true. On this subject, Mr. Chevenix says-
"
Wonderful, indeed, it may appear, but what makes anything
wonderful to us, if not our ignorance? In my recollection they
have wondered at hydrogen and oxygen, ata dead frog jumping
betveen tvo plates of metal, at gas-lights and steam-boats, and
'now they wonder at any one who wonders at these familiar things.
Everything in creation is wonderful or nothing is so, but the last

known truth always appears the most miraculous to imreflecting
minds. Since the world began, men have been wondering at every-
thing, till habit tamed their minds upon it."
"In receiving facts upon testimony," Dr. Abercrombie, in his
work on the Intellectual Powers, says, " that although it should
lead us to examine carefully the evidence upon which we receive
facts, "".ve should beware of allowing it to engender scepticism. For
while an unbounded credulity is the part of a weak mind which
never thinks or reasons at all, an unlimited scepticism is the part
of a contracted mind which reasons upon imperfect data, or makes
its own knowledge and extent of observation the standard and test
of probability. An ignorant peasant may reject the testimony of a
pliiiosopher in regard to the size of the moon, because he thinks he
has the evidence of his senses that it is only a foot in diameter ;
and a person holding a respectable rank in society is said to have
received with contempt the doctrine of the revolution of the earth
on its axis, because he was perfectly satisfied that his house was
never known to turn with its front to the north. When the King
of Siam was told by a Dutch traveller, that in Holland at certain
seasons of the year water becomes so solid that an elephant might
walk over it, he replied, ' I have believed many extraordinary
things which you have told me, because I took you for a man of
truth and veracity, but nov7 I am convinced that you lie.' Had
the King of Siam once seen water in a frozen state, he would not
only have been put right in regard to this fact, but his confidence
would have been shaken in his own experiience as the test of pro-
bability in other things, and he would have been more disposed for
the farther reception of truth upon the evidence of testimony."

SUMNAMBULISM AND CLAIRVOYANCE -A young gentleman,
known as Alexis the Somnambulist, has just arrived from Paris
under the care of M. Marcillet, and was exhibited yesterday, for the
first time (we believe) in London, at the residence of DI. Elliotson.
Alexis has for some period excited much interest in Paris by the
wonderful powers ofclairuayanee which he manifests whilst in a state
of magnetic sleep. Through the kindness of Dr. Elliotson, a
large
n_1rnber of ladies, and scientific and distinguished persons, had an
87
opportunity yesterday of witnessing M. Marcillet's experiments. It
is but just to Dr. Elliotson to observe, that previously to the com-
mencement of the experiments, he stated that he did not hold himself
at all responsible for what M. Marcillet had advanced. Knowing
M. Marcillet to be a gentleman of undoubted respectability, Dr.
Elliotson permitted him to hold his first levee in Conduit-street,
taking no part whatever in the proceedings. Without admitting
that we have become believers in the possibility of producing such
a condition as that known by the name of clairvoyance, we must
nevertheless honestly confess that we have been much staggered by
what we saw after M. Marcillet had thrown his patient into the
magnetic state, and exhibited the tetanic spasm or rigidity of the
muscles of the arms and legs which usually accompanies this con-
dition of the nervous system. Preparatory to the phenomena of
clairvoijance being shewn, the patient's eyes were bandaged. We
pledge ourselves that we did this effectually. To see, in the ordi-
nary sense of the word, a ray of light was physically impossible.
Two large pieces of wool were placed over each eye, and above this
were bound with great care two linen handkerchiefs folded several
times. Thus blindfolded, he was placed at a table and commenced
playing ecarte with a strange gentleman in the room. It was, in-
deed, wonderful to see with what accuracy he played, not only
knowing every suit he had in his own hands, but, by a species of
divination, being able to detect the condition of his opponent's hand.
Several persons played with him, and among others Mr. Jerdan,
who, however, was fortunate enough to beat the Somnambulist. To
exhibit the youth's extraordinary powers, a large book of plates,
nearly two inches in thickness, was placed between Alexis and liis
opponent, and, notwithstanding this physical impediment, the Som-
nambulist was able to tell the person with whom he was playing
the cards he held in his hand. It may be said there was collusion.
We know such was not the case. Alexis then had a letter placed
in his hands by Colonel Gurwood, with the view of ascertaining
whether he was competent to make out the name of the party who
had written the letter. It appears that Colonel Gurwood had
placed himself in communication with Alexis, some time back in
Paris, in order to discover whether he had it in his power to give
him any hint by which to enable him to discover the residence of
a French soldier, whose life Colonel Gurwood had saved during the
87
opportunity yesterday of witnesshig M. Marcillet's experiments. It
is but just to Dr. Elliotson to observe, that previously to the com-
mencement ofthe experimcnts,he stated that he did not hold himself
at all responsible for what M. Marcillet had advanced. Knowing
M. Marcillet to be a

placed himself in communication with Alexis, some time back in
Paris, in order to discover whether he had it in his power to give
him any hint by which to enable him to discover the residence of
a French soldier, whose life Colonel Gurwood had saved during the
88
siege of Badajos. Alexis, during the magnetic state, gave Colonel
Gurwood some valuable information on the subject of his enquiry;
and, acting upon this, he was fortunate enough to find not only
the name of the person, but his place of abode. Colonel Gurwood
wrote to the soldier, and the letter which he had placed folded in
Alexis' hands was the answer which he had received. Alexis, after
a little examination, wrote down the person's name, and told Col.
Gurwood the purport of the letter wliich he held in his hand. He
made certainly one mistake, in the final letter of the person's name;
but this did not in the slightest degree detract from his ordinary
penetration. Another gentleman who had not seen Alexis pre-
viously, (Colonel Gardener we believe,) asked the Somnambulist
to describe his residence. This he did with great accuracy, telling
him the number of pictures he had in his drawing-room, their pe-
culiar position, and the subjects of the pictures. "Watches were then
placed in his hand, and, by merely feeling on the back of the case
for a few minutes, he pointed out, with one exception, the exact
position of the hour and minute hands. A large book of plates
was subsequently held to the back of his head, and to the amaze-
ment of every person in the room Alexis was able to describe the
various prints to which his attention was directed.
" We have thus endeavoiu-ed faithfully to record the facts which
we witnessed this day. It is our belief that the experiments were
performed fairly, and that in no single instance did anything like
collusion exist. We do not pretend to account for the strange,
the wonderful phenomena which the youth certainly manifested.
Of course there were many present who refused to admit the pos-
sibility of any person seeing under such circumstances. One gen-
tleman, more incredulous that the rest, declared most emphatically
that Alexis was able to see down his nose—an hypothesis, we must
confess, at variance with all our anatomical and physiological
knowledge. With his eyes almost hermetically sealed he was able
to read a book taken from among a munber of works on the table.
Independently of this, a handkerchief t^\dce folded was placed over
the printed page of a large volume, and through this the Somnam-
bulist was able to read with faciHty. We have thus endeavoured
faithfully to record the experiments performed this day. We draw
no conclusions from the facts : we confess they are mysterious and
inexplicable—beyond our comprehension. Let those who are dis-

position of the hour and minute hands. A large book of plates
was subsequently held to the hack of his head, and to the amaze-
ment of every person in the room Alexis was able to describe the
various prints to which his attention was directed.
"
We have thus endeavoured faithfully to record the facts which
we witnessed this day. It is our belief that the experiments were
performed fairly, and that in no single instance did anything like
collusion exist. We do not pretend to account for the strange,
the wonderfull phenomena which the youth certainly manifested.
Of course there were many present who refused to admit the pos-
sibility of any person seeing under such circumstances. One gen-
tleman, more incredulous that the rest, declared most emphatically
that Alexis was able to see down his nose-an hypothesis, we must
confess, at variance with all our anatomical and physiological
knowledge. With his eyes almost hermetically sealed he was able
to read a book taken from among a number of Works on the table.
Independently of this, a handkerchief twice folded was placed over
the printed page ofa large volinne, and through this the Somnam-
bulist was able to read with facility. We have thus endeavoured
faithfully to record the experiments performed this day. We draw
no conclusions from the facts: we confess they are mysterious and
inexplicable-beyond our
comprehension. Let those who are dis-
81)
posed to be sceptical examine the matter for themselves; they will,
we understand, have frequent opportunities of doing »o."
In the Zoist will bo found other reports of Alexis on difierent
occasions. In the month of July last, another demonstration i>f
his powers was shewn at Dr. Elliotson's. The followin<; jrenth -
men having witnessed, some having tested, the above experiments,
voluntarily subscribed their names to a paper, expressive of tlicir
conviction of the integrity of these wonderful phenomena :

I avail myself of this opportunity to refer to the conduct of a
few medical men here in reference to Mesmerism, and more parti-
cularly to Clairvoyance and the case of Jane Knowles. If the
subject had been confined to Bath, I should not have taken any
further notice, as the matter was fully discussed in the local papers
but these gentlemen have been circulating even to this period a one-
sided report in different journals,—that I do not exaggerate, I will
mention that I have seen very lately accounts in three separate
pamphlets. In justice, therefore, to Dr. Owens, myself, and the
patient, I will give a condensed account of what actually occurred,
and on which they ground a charge of fraud. A certain set of ex-
periments took place at the Photographic Institution in this city.
The patient on being mesmerised read distinctly /owr times through
opaque substances, such as the covers of books when firmly and
skilfully secured by string. The proprietor was so struck with the
results, as voluntarily and emphatically to declare, that he should
feel it his duty to go to every medical man he knew and thus state
his convictions. After the experiments, four medical men called
at the Institution ; one of them, Mr. Thomas Barrett, retires into
a separate room with one of the books, and presently returns, say-
ing he had discovered the way in which the reading was efiTected:
on now looking at the book. Dr. Owens and myself find one of the
strings broken and the cover much creased. Mr. Barrett admits this,
but says it makes no difference ! as it was done in his attempt to
shew how the reading was accomplished; and at a subsequent
meeting, said he was so confused he did not know what he did. On
this meagre evidence a letter appeared, headed ''Fraud Detected,'*
signed hy four medical men, not one of whom had witnessed a single
one of the experiments ; and the only collateral proof appears to
have been this, that because Mr. Barrett, with the full use of his
sight (the patient was in the mesmeric state), and by breaking one
of the knots, was able to make out a portion of reading similar to
the patient's, that therefore the little girl must have been an im-
postor. Our reply was and is still, that, judging from what she
had previously done many times when rigidly tested—what she
had accomplished that very afternoon four times—and what she
has repeatedly done since (see Bristol and Cheltenham papers), that
there was not the slightest occasion for the presumed fraud ; and

able to form an opinion as those who were absent ; and we further
believe, that the presumed fraud could not have been committed
without immediate detection, as was shewn by us in Mr. Barrett's
own attempt.
To judge dispassionately on matters we have never seen, require:*
the mind to be free from all prejudice; let us then, on this subject,
hear the expressed and written opinions of those who had consti-
tuted themselves judges of mesmeric phenomena. Dr. Ferguson,
at a meeting in the City Rooms, though he ackowledged Dr. Elliot-
son's claims on the Profession, considered him a lost man, because
he believed in Clairvoyance; and from conviction, in the evidence
of his own senses. Mr. Barrett declared it as his opinion, that any
one who believed in such nonsence must be devoid of common
sense; and Dr. Cardew has twice written, that he "always had,
and ever should consider the subject the grossest humbug."
I conclude these remarks with a short account of Jane Knowles
at Cheltenham, after leaving Bath, and attested by the editors of
two newspapers there, with many others :
\_From the Cheltenhavi Examiner.^
" Yesterday morning, we had an opportunity of witnessing Jane
Knowles for the first time. She is a slightly made, intelligent girl,
about twelve years of age. On being placed in the mesmeric state
by Dr. Owens, she tried her strength on a gentleman present,
weighing, as he stated, 14 stone, or 200 lbs. He was lifted with
ease from the ground. The patient was then put through a series
of phrenological experiments, which proved successful; and at last
exhibited that peculiar condition of clairvoyance, wherein the patient
is supposed to read and see what passes with the eyes firmly closed.
In this state, a lady and gentleman of the audience, one holding
the hands firmly over the eyes, and the other placing a printed
paper in the patient's hand, the characters were deciphered with
ease. Several things were read in this manner, such as passages
selected at random from books, address cards, and hand-bills, and
all with the same result. Yesterday evening the patient was put
under a more searching examination: on that occasion, determined
to test the reality of the exhibition to the utmost, ]\Ir. A. Harper,
of the Free Press, provided liimself with a new book, a copy ofwhich
the patient had never seen ; and Mr. Norman, of the Examiner, ap-

the subject, and having only tmth for our
object, are as
fully
able to form an
opinion as those who were absent; and we further
believe, that the presumed fraud could not have been committed
without immediate detection, as was shown by us in Mr. Ban-ctt's
own attempt.

Knowles for the first time. She is a

exhibited that peculiar condition ofclairvoyance, wherein the patient
is supposed to read and see what passes with the eyes finuly closed.
In this state, a
lady and gentleman of the audience, one
holding
the hands firmly over the eyes, and the other placing sprinted
paper in the patient's hand, the characters were
deciphered with
ease. Several things were read in this manner, such as
passages
selected at random from books, address cards, and hand-bills, and
all with the same result. Yesterday evening the patient was put
under a more
searching exaininationz on that occasion, determined
to test the reality of the exhibition to the utmost, Mr. A. Harper,
of the Free Press, provided himself with a new book, a
copy ofwhich
the patient had never seen; and Mr. Norman, of the Examiner, ap-
92
plied his hands to the patient's eyes. The utmost care was taken
that no trick could be played: the eyes were closely held down, and
the experiment watched throughout, yet the patient read not only
the title-page of the book, hut one or two other portions of print
which were presented to her. Similar experiments were made by
others of the audience with the like success. It was the general
opinion among the spectators, that the exhibition was perfectly ge-
nuine; it certainly was of those who applied the different tests. It
is the more necessary to make this admission, if only as an act of
justice to Dr. Owens and the little girl, who have been lately de-
nounced as impostors, and on the authority, it is said, of individuals
who never themselves witnessed any of the experiments.
" Dr. Owens then alluded to the wager between himself and Dr.
Cardew of Bath, who had offered to lay £1000 to £100, that a case
could not be produced of reading a word enclosed in a box. Df.
Cardew most unhandsomely evaded his challenge, by stipulating,
amongst other things, that he should be allowed to hold a string
attached to the box, during the experiments ; whilst that Dr. Owens
should not come within so many feet of his patient ; that the expe-
riments should be confined to three or four of his own friends ; and,
although Dr. Cardew professed to allow an hour daily for a month,
he afterwards inserted a clause making one failure final. These
conditions he termed fair and honorable ; but such peculiar illus-
trations induced Dr. Owens to withdraw from such an unequal
contest."—[See also Bristol papers for December, 1844.]
As Dr. Cardew has repeated his challenge in one of the papers
referred to, I am deputed on the part of a gentleman to say, that,
subject to fair and honourable conditions, he is quite ready to accept
the challenge. Dr. Cardew offered, if he won, to give £100 to the
Bath Hospital: my friend makes the same offer; therefore, if Dr.
Cardew is "always sincere in his professions," the Hospital is sure
of £100 from one of the parties, with which sirni the Governors
may lay the foundation of a Mesmeric Ward, and then mesmerism
can be applied to many cases, which have hitherto been discharged
as incurable. If Dr. Cardew now declines, we must consider his
professions Vox etpretarea nihil.
