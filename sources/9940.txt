At approximately 3:45 a.m., I started having symptoms of ventricular tachycardia and my blood pressure started dropping. The last thing I remember was my blood pressure was 60/40. 

The next thing I know is that I am standing in a field and the grass was the greenest I have ever seen. I also saw that the sky was the bluest I have ever seen. Then the clouds were the whitest I have ever seen. It was so peaceful and the sun was shining brightly, even though I did not see the sun. I could feel the wind against my skin. I remember that it was very calm and I felt so serene and at peace. I said, 'Oh wow!' 

Suddenly, I felt my body being pulled to the right side and I awoke and saw that they were placing the wooden board under my body in the hospital. They were preparing to shock me but when I awoke, the doctors saw that my heart rate had returned to normal. I asked the nurse why all the doctors were in my room and she said that I had gone into cardiac arrest and that they had lost me. I told the nurse about my experience and she said that I surely must have gone to the other side.
