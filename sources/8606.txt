Oh   Sane and Sacred Death,    by Louise Ireland-Frey, M.D.    Blue Dolphin Publishing, 2002
  
  The   best book ever on Death and it's role in being!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I feel 'excited to the brim' in directing and inviting you to read this   marvelously crafted work of art, love, and wisdom.&nbsp; Having consumed many   hundreds of books on philosophy, ideology, mysticism, grief, loss and death; I   am awed at the comprehensive and compassionate content of Dr. Ireland-Frey's   work.&nbsp; She has drawn on her decades of work in medicine, psychiatry, and   personal fulfillment to present the public with this gift of insight and   understanding on life, death, and the LIGHT within us all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her   book; subtitled: 'First person accounts of Death'; she truly conveys the   insights that show us 'Death does not Exit'.&nbsp; She introduces us to her work with   'Philosophical Assumptions' that are, in fact, the most accurate and concise   enumerations of the Wisdom of the Ages.&nbsp; She goes on to illustrate these   insights with examples from NDE stories, personal experiences, exercises we can   use to enhance our own personal progress, and suggestions of how we can serve   each other thru the process of grief, loss and death.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I   especially enjoyed the chapter on animals.&nbsp; It gives great insight to why so   many of us seek harmlessness to all living things.&nbsp; She illustrates with Albert   Schweitzer's commitment to 'Reverence for all life'.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met   this petite 80+ year old angel at a recent 'Meet the Board' gathering of the   IANDS board of directors in Pagosa Springs, Colorado.&nbsp; In her own quiet,   unassuming way, she brought a sweet quiet delight to our meeting.&nbsp; She reminded   me of my time spent with Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross in her manners and of Ram   Dass and Stephen Levine in her thoughtful communications.&nbsp; A week later, I   received her book as a gift in return for my gift to her of When Ego Dies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I invite   and encourage each of you to spend some quiet time enjoying this great gift of   understanding.&nbsp;

Regards,

Edward
