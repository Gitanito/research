Time, would’st thou hurt us? Never
Break as thou w ilt these bodies of
blind clay,
Thou canst not touch us here, in our
stronghold.
Where two, made one, laugh all thy
powers away.
Though ramparts crumble and rusty
gates grow thin,
And our brave fortress dwine to a
hollow shell,
Thou shalt hear heavenly laughter, far
within;
Where, young as Love, two hidden
lovers dwell.
We shall go clambering up our twisted
stairs
To watch the moon through rifts in
our grey towers.
Thou shalt hear whispers, kisses, and
sweet prayers
Creeping through all our creviced
walls like flowers.
W ould’st wreck us, Time? When thy
dull leaguer brings
The last wall down, look heavenward.
We have wings.
shall we grow old.

INTRODUCTION
W h a t is T h e Short Cu t ?
n p H E Short C u t is the im m ediate possession o f
your h e a r t ’s d e sir e ; n ot n ext year, n o t
n ext m onth, nor tom orrow , bu t N O W .
T h e prom issory side o f the N e w P sychology
is so great that it com es w ith an alm ost stagger­
ing suddenness to the old m ind im bued w ith the
old th ou gh t ideas.
"There is noth ing w e cannot have,” says the
new seer " if you w an t any thing, w h y don’t you
have it?” T his is the only really p oten t question
o f the day.
T he new P sychologist goes deeply to the root
o f hum an desire and sees that all hum anity
w ants the same things, on ly in varying degrees,
and know s that all hum an endeavor is directed
tow ard the attainm ent o f the heart’s desire.
N o m atter how frail the m ethod, no m atter
how frau ght w ith superstition, tradition, or
weakness, through everything there runs the
slender thread o f hum an desire, calling insatiably
for its ow n.
T he new seer says, "Y ou w an t health, w ealth,
love and usefulness. So do I, so does the w hole
w orld;— w ell, you can have them . I f it is
health you are calling for, bring it to yourself

and cease to drag around a body that shrieks
w ith pain. Is it w ealth you w ant? T h en get it,
and stop your soul-sickened cry for liberty from
your lim itations. Is it love you seek? T hen call
it to you, to have and hold till the w an t grow s
cold, or links your soul w ith your "other soul”
to the edge o f the grave and on beyond into the
dream to com e. A re you tired o f idleness?
T hen get busy. W h y should your soul stand
dum b and useless amid the great w orld throng?
W hat do you w an t to do? G o do it. There
is no one w ho says no to you bu t yourself; the
great U niversal Supply o f all these things stands
w aiting to be acted upon. Y ou are the actor. N o
one w ill give to you b u t yourself, no one can
take aw ay from you bu t yourself; the U niversal
Supply is w illin g,— w h at is the m atter w ith
you?”
T he N e w P sychology explains all o f the laws
o f attainm ent. It explains them in a w ay that can
be understood and practiced, bu t after the last
w ord has been said and the last lesson absorbed,
there com es from the questioning students this
never failing question and these statem ents:—
"Is there no short cut? I believe if I fo llo w the
new laws laid dow n this higher revelation o f our
day and hour, I shall eventually send m yself
in to possession o f all that m akes life w hole and
com plete; but these m ethods take tim e, this
kingdom o f conquest is not born overnight.
"I do n ot w an t to w ait. If these things are
law — and all things are accom plished through
the law o f the thing itself— is there no w ay by

w hich w e can transcend the slow er action and
becom e one w ith the finer actions o f the same
law , as the m otor car transcends the ox cart in
the law o f transportation?
"I cannot w ait. There is noth ing I w ill n ot
do to get w ealth at once, there is no personal
test I w ill n ot stand to free m yself from the
galling chains o f poverty; I w ill lay dow n some
part o f m y ow n life for the love that loves m e;
I w ill spare no effort o f personal givin g to be able
to be o f great use to m y day and age. T ell m e,
is there no short cu t? ”
In answer to the thousands w ho ask these
questions this book is w ritten .
Yes, there is a short cu t to R E G E N E R A ­
T IO N O F O U R W H O L E B E IN G . It is a short,
steep clim b ou t onto the m ountain tops where
life ’s finer forces do the super-w ork, and the
m ethod is sim ple: just fast and breathe, control
eating, exercise, think, feel, and act in unison
w ith the H igher Law and R egeneration w ill be
yours.
"Strait is the gate and narrow is the w ay—
and few there be w h o w alk therein.” M any are
called but few are chosen, but to the one w ho
falters not, the promises are all fulfilled at once,
because he sets the law o f the prom ises in action
by his ow n extended consciousness.

W h y W e Fast
W V T e fast prim arily because w e have found
o u t that through fasting w e can outstrip
the law s o f evolu tion and find the hum an p ath ­
w ay o f transm utation. E volution is the long
w ay; transm utation is the Short C u t to higher
hum an attainm ent.
T here are fou r distinct hum an reasons w hy
w e fast. W e fast for purification, first o f all.
I f there w ere no other reasons, this w ould be
sufficient cause to entice us to this m ethod o f
u n fold m en t. It is an u n w ritten law that
N atu re m ust unload the old as it passes on in
its processes. T here is no place in any o f N a ­
tu re’s schem es w here the old is retained longer
than necessary to m ake a fittin g p rotection for
the new .
T he physical body m ust unload its w aste
products or the bloated, discolored flesh is its
reward. There is no m istaking the signals
N atu re sets on the face o f the ordinary individ­
ual. It speaks its message in tones too plain to
be overlooked. O ne has only to look at the
great crow d o f disease-laden folk ,— just go to
the rest-hom es, or the hospitals, or hom es. A ll

w ho tell in every line o f their faces how far they
have violated this first holy law .
E very bit o f food taken in to the body m ust
be throw n ou t again. It is the D ivin e Law o f
the physical cell. N atu re does n ot use any o f
the crude food consum ed by individuals for an y­
thing excep t fuel. It is used to set in operation
the activity o f the cells o f the body, and these
secrete their ow n substance,— m uch too fine a
product to be taken from any o f the badly
cooked, m ixed and m al-digested food stuffs.
T his is the lastest discovery in nu trition; w e
m ust kn ow , once and for all, that the cells o f
the body are the divine producers, and all food
taken in to the body m ust be throw n ou t as soon
as it has served the purpose o f stim ulating the
cell into generation, secretion and excretion o f
the finer food substance w ith in it.
T he coarser substance o f the food is throw n
out from the gastro-intestinal tract, the finer
through the kidneys, others through the per­
spiratory tract, and the still finer particles
through the breath in respiration. B ut no
m atter through w hich channel it is done, there
are m illions o f cells o f intelligence in the body
w orking ceaselessly, night and day, in the g i­
gantic plan o f excretion and elim ination, ab­
sorption and nutrition. A s long as the norm al
unloading process is m aintained, the physical
body retains its norm al health; break this balance,
and disease begins to be apparent in the flesh.
W hen the elim ination is n ot equal to the in ­
com ing substance, it has to be taken care o f in

the flesh body o f the individual and it is stored
up as fa t or deposits. T h en the individual be­
com es the unsanitary receptacle o f his ow n
w aste products. T his substance is o ften dis­
solved into fine solutions and finds its w ay into
the circulation, poisoning the blood, overw eight­
ing it and congesting it in m any different parts
o f the body.
E very pain that racks the flesh is the voice o f
N atu re saying "U nload, p u rify, purify, P U R I­
F Y !” W ith purification com es peace.
There is only one real cause o f disease in the
w orld and that is congestion', there is on ly one
cure and that is circulation. C irculation cannot
be norm al w hen the blood current o f the body
is a heavy stream loaded dow n w ith the w aste
products o f the naturally changing flesh.
Purification is, too, a m atter o f the m ind.
A fter w e have paid atten tion to the purification
o f the body, w e have yet the m ind and the
em otions to unload and, beyond these, the higher
part o f the m ind w h ich, like a dusty m irror,
shuts us out from the fu ll ligh t o f the higher
registration o f the Celestial light.
T he second reason for Fasting is discipline.
N o one can ever hope to outstrip the evolu tion ­
ary laws o f life w hile he sets for him self only
the tasks o f the ordinary hum an. O n ly to the
breathless runner up life ’s hill w ho, spent and
dust covered, beats his breast against the tape
o f w isdom , w ill higher T ru th reveal or M ystery
explain.
T he price o f the better part is understanding,

and understanding o f life ’s finer forces can only
com e w hen one holds his w hole being subject to
the discipline o f higher laws.
There are those w h o long to possess the very
last g ifts that life can hand them , yet w an t to
gain them w ith ou t self-conquest or com radeship
w ith the things w h ich are a part o f the larger
gain. T h ey w an t fam e, pow er, strength,
w ealth, love;— great recognition w ith ou t the
needed spiritual exertion to w in it.
There are m any w h o never set any kind o f
test for them selves. T h ey are w eaklings in
body, m ind and soul. W hen asked to give up
anything,— from a dou ghn ut to a dollar,— they
w hine, and sulk, and are perpetually sorry for
them selves.
"W hat shall a m an give in exchange for his
soul?” was the question o f the old seer. T he
new seer says "W hat shall a m an give in exchange
for his soul’s desire?” T he answer is,— "E very­
thing that w ill fulfill the law o f that desire.”
A nd there are seven planes o f consciousness on
w h ich he has to m ake the exchange and fulfill
the law .
T h rou ghou t all tim e the short cu t for ex­
change has been fasting and celibacy. W h en ­
ever the ordinary race m an w anted anything
m ore than his ow n hum an indulgences, and was
w illin g to p u t up the proofs by fu lfillin g the
higher law o f discipline, he m ade him self—
through self control— a m agnet attractin g to
him , from ou t the Infinite Supply, the things
he desired.

W hen a m an can look at a tem p tin g dinner
and n ot eat, w h en no one says no to him b u t
him self, or w h en he can face the m ad urge o f a
strong radiant passion and curb it— n ot because
he m ust bu t because he will, k n ow in g that he
w ants som ething a thousand tim es m ore than he
w ants his ow n natural satisfaction, then he is on
the short cu t to higher possessions and neither
deep nor high can keep his ow n aw ay from
him . H ig h stakes are hard to w in , and the short
cu t is n o t the path w ay o f the w eakling or the
cow ard, b u t it belongs to the strong heart and
resolute m ind.
T he third reason for fasting is attainm ent.
T here are those w ho never get w h at they w an t,
never get it w hen they w an t it, nor how th ey
w an t it; never keep it if they get it and o ften ,
w h en th ey have gotten it and grow n tired o f it,
they cannot cast it aside and go on in to union
w ith their n ext desires.
So w e fast for attainm ent on all planes o f
being and for attainm ent w h ich w ill fu lfill and
accom plish our selfhood. W e have learned that
w e m ay have w hat w e w an t, when w e w an t it
and how and where, and that w hen w e have lived
up our desires w e m ust unload them and elim inate
just as w e did on the physical plane. M ental,
em otional or spiritual stagnation is just as dan­
gerous as plethora in the flesh. W e fast to dis­
place the old things and attain the n ew qu ick ly
and harm oniously.
There is no use dragging on year after year
w ith hope dead in our breasts. L ife is joy

through love and service, G od has n ot given us
a spirit o f fear, but o f love, joy and a sound
m ind. People p u t up w ith things and places
and other people that, in the true schem e o f
life, should have been unloaded long ago.
O ld th ou gh t teachings, traditions, lack o f dis­
cipline and a consciousness born from these
teachings bind and enslave the m ind o f the evol-
ing crow d; bu t the transm utation m an, on the
short cu t, know s that as he clim bs he m ust dis­
place the old things o f one level b y the incom ing
things o f the n ext, and, as he fasts and m entally
unloads, he stands ou t— stripped to the spirit­
ual skin, ready to call around him self all the
things o f this n ew fou n d kingdom . These things
are fashioned through the fresh desires o f his
ow n m ind.
Physical, m ental and em otional baggage m ust
be laid dow n, and new , fresh, un polluted desires
m ade ready for fulfillm en t.
W hen one has decided w h at he wishes to u n ­
load, planned carefully w h at he desires to attain,
fasted and breathed for it, it can no m ore escape
him than the budding flow ers can escape the
w arm penetrating rays o f the sun w hich, b y n a t­
ural law , drive them on in to a w ild burst o f
bloom .
T he fou rth reason for fasting is m anifesta­
tion. T here are so m any w ho live , m ove and
have being in a w orld o f realization and never
get farther than that in their un fold m en t.
It is n ot enough to possess anything in th ou gh t
that does n ot fulfill. W e w an t to "kiss the lips

o f our desires”. There are m any w ho feel rich
in their being, yet are ever cou n tin g pennies;
m any w ho feel strong as a gaint inside, y et falter
w hen needed to lift a pound, the spirit is w ill­
ing b u t the flesh is w eak; there are m any w ho
have a constant w ell-spring o f love and u sefu l­
ness in consciousness but w ho never find an
ou tlet to their deep wells. T h ey ask "W h y is
it that I seem alw ays just about to accom plish
and yet all that makes life really w orth w hile
passes m e by?” T he new seer says "W hen you
have had enough, you can quit. H ave you
w aited long enough? T hen stop. W ho makes
you w ait? Yourself!”
W hen w e are ready to step ou t from the law
o f relay in to the larger one o f m anifested con­
ditions w e can turn on the stronger ligh t o f
higher w isdom and Burbank ourself ou t o f the
old law and, through fasting, produce a new
realization in a n ew form . W e can un k n ow
a thin g ourself, w ith the pow er w e realize in to
being.
"T he thin g w e seek is seeking us.” T here is
nothing the m atter w ith the law , there is only
som ething the m atter w ith our m anipulation o f
it. "God has provided som e better things for us
that, w ith ou t us, cannot be m ade p erfect.”
W hen once w e have taken our desires firm ly
into our m inds and com e to the m om ent where
w e w ill n ot w ait another hour, then fasted, our
realization m ust pass, by natural cosm ic .law ,

passes step by step, building the supra-structure
o f the n ew Self. H e w ants p erfection m ore
than he w ants self-indulgence. H e takes body,

and Illum inati fasting.
There are n ot m any things to be said; the
m ethods, on all planes, are sim ple to tell, yet n ot
so sim ple to do. A ll the w ritten words on earth
could n ot cover everything that the Initiate w ill
w an t to know . Each faster presents a new
problem , as each one w ill react to the Fast in his

A fter years o f careful scientific and psychical
study, these instructions have been chosen as
fundam ental principles for all, w hich, if fo l­
low ed, w ill lead the Initiate on in p erfectly nor­
m al developm ent. It is im possible for any one
to have m alicious reactions in either body or
m ind if he follow s these instructions.
There are those w ho have fasted outside o f
instructions, w ith just a little learning, never
acquainting them selves w ith the real m eaning
o f the Fast, then w hen they have com e upon
som e unexplainable phenom ena in m ind and
body they have laid the blam e on fasting, w hen
in fa ct it was only their ow n ignorant use o f a

"The first law o f a N o v itia te or an Initiate is
to O B E Y ” , and unless w e w an t to do this and
obey fa ith fu lly the teachings to those w ho
know , w e had better let things alone and take
our chances w ith the great evolvin g masses w ho
take life as it com es— easy, safe and slow .
There is n ot a single sym p tom o f body, m ind,
em otion or revelation w hich cannot at once be
reduced to norm al by a single cup o f coffee or
tea. A fter one has fasted a w hile he w ill be
disgusted w ith his o w n weakness and at the
"hold” a little food has upon him . It w ill fire
his spiritual pride w hen he finds that the very
slough o f despair and the valley o f physical
prostration, a little like a cup o f coffee, tea or
m ilk w ill m ake him feel a norm al m an, w h ich
w ith ou t, he had not the soul pow er to be. T he
real d ivin ity w ith in us com es to laugh at our
frail dust "dam ning us ever to decay and death,
w h en at our center burns the flame o f God ”
T he m ethod o f the physical fast is very
sim ple. Just stop eating: Eat one m eal every
other day for ten days. In the last tw o days o f
the fast do not drink any w ater, or at least only
enough to keep from real thirst. T he Fast is
n ot penance,— it is a joy, and thirst that one
can easily com bat w ill do the w ork o f em p ting
the blood vessels. G et a big thirst, bu t do not
push it to the point o f suffering.
W h y do w e eat one m eal every other day
instead o f fasting continuously? Because this is
the w ay to fast and n ot destroy any o f the nor­

In this m anner the gastro-intestinal tract is kept
norm al, and, w hen the F A ST is ended, the faster
can resume his norm al meals, w ith ou t discom ­
fort, the blood current is relieved o f all its waste
substance, the blood cell itself exhausted w ith ou t
affecting the nucleus o f the cell. In an u n in ­
terrupted fast the w hole cell is oftim es destroyed
and a long tim e is needed for the reconstruction
o f the blood current. O ne m eal every other day
com es in tim e to save the life o f the cell but
does n ot interfere w ith its reconstruction.
W hen should this m eal be eaten? B etw een
eleven and tw o every other day. T he m idday
meal com es just w hen the energies are fagging
and it restores the equilibrium o f the body again.
A fter the m eal there com es in to the body a great
influx o f vital energy, and this energy w ill m ake
for w akefulness if the m eal is taken at n igh t or
late in the day. Sleeplessness is a part o f the
norm al reaction after a w eek o f fasting and
does n ot need accentuation w ith food.
W h at should be eaten at this meal? E very­
thing and anything agreeable to the appetite
and as m uch as one w ants. Eat a m ixed diet;
the system needs all kinds o f food from w hich
to select the new fuel for its new release o f in ­
terior substance, and a single diet w ill not sat­
isfy the dem ands o f the physical cells.
Shall w e drink w ater w ith meals? If you
like,— it does n ot m atter. D o JU S T as you

T he ordinary individual, fasting for a short
cu t to health, freedom , liberty, success, love and
truth, can be just as happy and norm al in his
one m eal as he know s how to be.
C om m on sense dem ands that he eat slow ly,
Fletcherizing his food. It w ill give him a
sense o f uncom fortable distension o f the stom ­
ach and som etim es bloating and gas if he does
not. W hen one feels worse after eating than
before, it is because he has eaten too fast and not
taken tim e to m asticate his food.
D u rin g these ten days o f abstinence from
food, the body tissues w ill fall aw ay; the m us­
cles w ill becom e flabby and soft and it is here
that physical exercise, breathing, massage, w alk ­
ing, dancing, electricity and all attention to the
flesh should be given. O ne m ust break up all
his old flesh tracts and lay the foun dation for a
new body. If he does n ot like his face he can
change it; if he does n ot like his form he can
give him self a new one just as easily as he can
order a new suit o f clothes.
A ll old age is in the food body. T he life body
is young, fresh, unw rinkled; n ot fa t or flabby
nor skinny, but just w hole. W hen one gets his
m isfit food body out o f the w ay by fasting,
breathing and exercise, he gives the life cells a
chance to m ake him a new flesh suit, and this
flesh suit can be o f any type that he him self
decides. O ur life cells are creators and they
create just w hat w e determ ine they shall create;

to build the pattern w e give them and our per­
sonality is a picture o f our ow n thoughts o f
G od (G o o d ).
W e k n ow that all fever diseases kill off the
food body and w e have all seen instances w here,
after a prolonged fever, the patient lost hair,
was reduced to skin and bone. W hen he recov-
eered and took on flesh, he was a new creature,
plus a new crop o f shining hair.
W e k n ow now that fasting does just this re­
arrangem ent o f the flesh, and does it w ith ou t
the penance o f fever, pain and disease. So w e
just stop eating and break up our old flesh body
in every w ay that w e can; w e get back to norm al
posture, stand erect w ith all our bony structure
held as it should be, so that w h en our new body
com es on it w ill be draped w ith grace over our

A beautiful figure is the birthright o f every

line and w rinkle, free the m uscles from the

W rinkles under the chin are caused b y sagg­
ing m uscles on the back o f the neck. W hen
these are tightened b y fasting and massage and
the new body com es on, they act as a strong
guard against fu tu re looseness. H o llo w cheeks
and skinny faces, bones and hollow chests are
all set free by the Fast, massage and exercise.
W hen the new food body appears, the hollow s
are norm ally filled and a so ft contour takes the
place o f the old ugliness.
M ental states and m ental pressure set their
stam p in the physical form and face; "A s a m an
thinketh, so is he” and every person th irty years
old wears the stigm ata o f his ow n thoughts.
There is also an occu pation personality,— w e
say "H e looks like a farm er, or a preacher, or a
professional m an, or a business m an” and this
tells us som ething, w ith ou t seeing the person,
o f his personality.
There is nothing so p itifu l as a retired business
m an tryin g to be an idle gentlem an w ith m arks
o f his old business all over him . A w orking
w om an’s face does n ot fit w ell the g et-rich -

the faces and form s o f m ost m others, bu t there is
no reason w h y the grandm other should bear yet
upon her face and form the traces o f conditions
w hich have ceased fifteen or tw en ty years ago.

T he answer to w h y they do n ot com e is sim ­
ple. First, they do not believe that it can be
done, they have never seen it done and the old
race teachers are w edded loyally to eating. T h ey
have m ade food their god instead o f the G od

m ake a carbon through w h ich the passing cu r­
rents can break into energy. "M an is n ot flesh,
he’s fire: and at his undiscovered center is the
flame from w hence he cam e.”
T hen again, by the tim e old age com es on,
they have have an old old age consciousness and
they hug to them selves the c o zy corners; they

T he physical body is m ade up o f tw o kinds o f

O ne great arm y o f intelligence is called the
"perm anent atom ” electrons— m entoids— bu t
psychologically and preferably, the "life cells” ;
these cells are em bryonic and are first and last in
the schem e o f creation o f the flesh. These kn ow
noth ing o f age or pain, decay or disease; they
are life, noth ing bu t life, expressed in unceasing
construction and reconstruction.
T he other cells are the food cells and these are
the cells w h ich proliferate, build and change.
T he food body is p u t off and on; it is on ly the
insulator o f the life body and the food cells

There are those w ho are really dead in their
shell o f food cells; no m atter w hat th ey eat or
w hat they do, they cannot bring any effect to
bear on their flesh. It is just as m uch a sign o f
error to have a body that never responds to food,
never puts on a pound o f flesh, as to have one
w h ich calls for food continu ally and builds it
all in to excess flesh.
O ur first step, then, in the physical fast, is
just to stop eating long enough w h olly to re­
arrange the food body. W e m ust w an t to fast
m ore than w e w an t to eat and have spiritual
discipline enough to set the law for our ow n
cell calls. A ll appetite is in the food body and as it
lives by the stim ulation o f food, it m ust die if
it does n ot receive it.
There are several different degrees o f vitality
in the food cells. In the first d ay’s fast, m illions
o f so ft cells w ill perish b u t there are others
w h ich w ill still persist. W e m ust fast un til,
from every organ o f the physical body, the food
body has died out, leaving just the one natural
layer w hich nature gave in the beginning as in ­
sulation o f the life cells.
T he thirst o f the drunkard and the habit o f
the drug fiend is in his food body. It is the
appetite o f the cell that calls for its continual
satisfaction, w hich keeps them both returning
to the drink and the dope long after the m ind

food is stronger than the w ill pow er w h ich the
m ind sets up in opposition,— in spite o f resolu­
tions the cell hunger conquers them .
T he first real aid to a degenerate o f drink or
drugs is to fast off his saturated food body and
let him grow a new one under the vibrations o f
a new thou ght im pluse; after a w hile his body
has a new cell consciousness and it has becom e
his helper instead o f his destroyer.
A ll one needs to do in order to determ ine the
tru th o f this statem ent is to look at the flesh
body o f the drunkard before fasting and after
fasting. N o w ill pow er on earth is strong
enough to break the chains o f a saturated, w his­
key-sodden flesh desire unless it is linked w ith a
m ethod that helps conquer through a higher
law .
A ll physical disease is due to abnorm al tissue
changes, beginning w ith fu n ctio n and ending
w ith change o f structure. A ll kidney trouble
begins in change o f tissue and all change o f tissue
is food -cell change. T he kidneys break dow n

There are those w ho need the fast for em o­

com plete and p erfect self-expression. T here are
m any w ho have never in their lives done the
things w hich they really w anted to do; they have
shut ou t all sentim ent, all softness, all sweetness,
— never loafed w ith their souls: "T hey have
starved their heart; w alked where beauty was a

the soul w hich should be free,— treading the

These are longing w ith a m igh ty desire to be

their innate tim id ity, w h ich has kept them re­
pressed all their lives, has at the same tim e kept
them from developing their biggest selfhood;
they need a larger fling into experience, and
fasting opens the door to larger opportunities.
W hat they call liberty w ill be to the really free
people sim ply a smaller form o f bondage.
I f you belong to their class, then w hile you

soul.

It was the false interpretation o f this part

Beauty is a perfect balance in the flesh of all
of life’s finer forces. W ith o u t this one m ay

CHAPTER VI
T h e Illum inati Fast
^
’JpHERE are grades of fasting which one must
recognize when he begins his short cut to
at-one-ment with finer forces.
The one who is taking the fast for the first
time cannot expect to take the same kind of
fast as those who have done the fast for several
months or years. After we have established the
habit of fasting, we can go as far as we like in
experimenting with occult laws; but in the be­
ginning we should take the Novitiate instruc­
tions and follow them faithfully; through these
we reach the point of mental and psychical
endurance and discipline which enables us to
take up the Initiates’ fast or the fast of the
Illuminati.
After one has taken many fasts, our several
bodies become accustomed to the new action
and reaction, and the new demands made upon
them cannot throw them out of harmony or
allow them to over-intensify in any of their
sensations.
The Illuminati Fast is a fast from food, water,
emotional stimulus (sex) and sleep.
There are many who learn to fast from food
more easily than from drink or sleep. It is as
[ 4 4 ]
Original from
UNIVERSITY OF MICHK
important to fast from drinking as it is to fast
from food. All the fluids of the body must be
withdrawn and the blood current depleted as
far as possible.
In the olden days the masters used to bleed
the patients, understanding even then that the
life of the body is in the blood and that a new
blood current would bring about great changes
in the body, and also that the blood current is
the carrier of poisonous debris, and the serum of
the blood is often only a stagnate pool of sub­
stance, breeding disease in the body, as a stag­
nant, malaria-laden pool of water poisons the
air. When the infected blood was spilled, the
blood current rebuilt itself and bleeding was a
short cut to regeneration, sometimes to rein­
carnation as it was, like many of the old methods,
too strenuous a process for the already depleted
patient, and it is much too strenuous for the
soft consciousness of this day and age.
In the new method of fasting, the same effect
as bleeding is secured, with none of its limita­
tions; the blood current is drained to the lowest
ebb, and when eating is begun again, a clear,
sparkling stream of oxygenized blood is ready
to carry the substance which Nature intended
it should carry.
To fast from drinking until the flesh is
thoroughly drained of all serum, is a part of
the Illuminati test. It is easily done and the
rewards come quickly to the Initiate. A new
blood stream quickens every state of conscious­
ness, while good, rich, red blood exerts a new
[ 4 5 ]

T h e S h o r t C u t T o
influence on body, mind and heart.
Many can readily fast from food and water,
but not from sleep. The fast from sleep is to
some the greatest discipline. The world is full
of "sleepy-heads” who are nodding if they go
an hour over their bedtime, and are cross, de­
pressed and out of all harmony if they are
obliged to rise before their regular hour. The
loss of one night’s sleep makes perfect wrecks
and cranks of them, and to have a night of
broken rest renders them inert the whole of
the next day.
There are thousands of people who say "I
must be regular in my habits or I am perfectly
worthless.” Yes, these must be until they learn
a new form of regularity; some form of regu­
larity persisted in leads to stagnation and slow
unfoldment. Ruts are not valuable on any plane,
—even the common race man in the wagon
avoids them on his way.
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man
healthy, wealthy and wise” was written by one
of those nodders who believed in it, while "Early
to bed and early to rise may do very well for
sick folks and guys” was written by one who
had passed the time when sleep as a habit con­
quered him.
Sleep as a restorer, educator and revelator is
the truth of sleep, but sleep as a habit is the con­
sciousness that has not yet come to the power
of the "short cut”.
Those who do not know the mysteries of
night (night, in which the long vigil of the
[ 4 6 ]

R egeneration T hrough Fasting
human mind lets in the higher forces of the
higher mind) have lived but half of life. There
is something born from a solitary vigil that is
not found in the glare and activity of the day­
light world.
Every hour differs from the last. There is a
time just between three o’clock and five when
all the vibrations of the earth change. It seems
the good-bye of the night and the awakening
of the day. Day holds night in some subtle,
lingering embrace that will not let go until the
very gray o f the dawn drives the reluctant
darkness from the earth.
It is at the hour of three that egos who are
just lingering for the silver cord to break, will
slip away. This is the death hour of the planet,
—here is where the balance is most often cast,
and those who fight death may well take their
place at the bedside. Whether they see their
ghostly visitor or not, they may know he is
there, and only a strong, enduring recognition
of life will hold the sick friend or loved one on
this side of the veil.
No one really needs to die if he deeply cares
to live, but it takes a conscious choice of the
ego-man to extend his own life orbit, and, with
this, a strong centralizing power on this side of
the veil. Those who feel the chill of this hour
creep into the room and over them, will do well
to understand that "The river widens as it nears
the sea,” and they must fling their minds with
no uncertain desire for life, and more and more
life. Then when the gray dawn comes in, the
[ 4 7 ]
G o < >gle Origin
UNIVERSITY
T h e S h o r t C u t T o
watcher can lie down to sleep in peace and the
patient turn with new rest to his pillow, and all
will rejoice because "he is better in the morning.”
To the Illuminatus who watches these hours
through for increased vibration and wider rev­
elation, there will come the same consciousness
of the ebbing tide of life,— the whole sea of
power is gone and all the gray rocks and mud
covered valleys of his life will stand revealed,
all weakness, all regrets, all remorse, all failures,
all loss, will take mental form again and mock
him,—the light of hope will burn low.
Empty of normal physical food, alone with
the haunting memories of his past of millions
of years, facing all the unrevealed adventures
of a million years to come, he thinks in eterni­
ties as well as in time, and often here the Initiate
turns back; the load of revelation is too heavy
and he turns shudderingly away, seeking eagerly
the fleshpots and the path of evolution, rather
than meet himself in the karmic precipitate of
his own transmutation short-cut.
The daylight is powerful, beautiful and com­
plete, but it is filled only with objective calls
and rampant, active, surging force; it is an in­
sistent energy that does not mean to let the
mind of man rest. It is induced action on every
plane, and that thing which does not move into
radiant life it kills by the force of its own
surging rays.
The moonlight, starlight and midnight are the
great receptive forces and in their passive action
something falls like a soft mantle over the tired
[ 4 8 ]
Original from
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIC
life of the world,—no work at night can take
on the wear and tear of the day to those who
are in harmony with the forces of the hours.
The stillness, the lack of noises that fret the
nerves and brain, the soft, slow turning of the
table of time, the changing vibrations of the
hours themselves,— the white light of the mid­
night hours,—the dull gray of the coming dawn
—all bring their own subtleties and weave them
into the life substance of those who have the
strength of character to seek and find.
Fasting, breathing, meditation, concentration,
and sleepnessness, this is the discipline whereby
the race man opens the doors to higher power
and perfected perception. "He who puts his
hand to the plow and turns back, is not fit for
the kingdom of God,” the olden mystics said.
There are seven bodies, with their own exist­
ing states of consciousness, which are at all times
in action in the physical one, and when one fasts
from sleep he intensifies the second, or astral
body, and through this he can register all the
wisdom of the Akashic records of his physical
brain.
One part of the brain is for registration—a
form of thought higher than mental thinking.
In this part of mind one does not think— the
thoughts think him. His own mind is a re­
ceiving radio center and not a generator of
thought force; he receives a stream of thought
force so big that he does not need to translate
it into thought, form or speech. It flashes into
his idea centers and the ideas, words and all are
[ 4 9 ]
Origi
UNIVERSITY
T h e S h o r t C u t T o
registered at once, like sight reading as compared
to the old tiresome way of spelling and pro­
nouncing.
This registration part of the mind is the "flash
consciousness” used by seers, prophets and re-
velators.
"Before ye call, I hear” the masters said of
old, and this is the part of man’s divine mind
which IS and only needs to be contracted to
know. Back of the knowing and the thing
known stands the KNOW ER, which is ever
ready to flash all wisdom into the human idea
centers when the human himself will get the
wireless machine of his own mind in perfect
accord with the within.
The Illuminati Fast subordinates the flesh, it
stills the discordant thinking, it hushes the
emotional call and clears the field of conscious­
ness for the flash lights of the higher self.
Sometimes the bodily senses become a thou­
sand times more acute, but this acuteness only
serves as a springboard for the higher bodies; the
mind then becomes equally alert, all five senses
over-intensified, the emotions quickened, until
joy can be so intense it almost becomes pain; or
pain so sweet that it becomes a pleasure to match
it against the ever widening reaches of the self
conscious attainment.
One often has to go far on in extended sen­
sation before he will understand how pleasure
is pain and pain is pleasure, but there is a spot
where they blend, just as there is a change of
normal sensation in the body in which one can-

not distinguish between heat and cold when
applied to the skin. In the old world this is
called disease, but in the new world, where men
act naturally with so-called abnormal laws, it
becomes only a place in consciousness which
holds in its unrevealed crypts some revelations
of the self, unguessed by the normal dwellers of
the world of normal sense.
In the flights of illumination which come to
the Illuminati, many things are revealed which
before were sealed. "He that lacketh wisdom,
let him ask of God” was the admonition of the
masters of the past, and here in this illumined
place in our own human mind, we are in direct
contact with the universal mind and all things
being written on the records of the Infinite
become our personal possessions.
There are many great kingdoms of conscious­
ness awaiting our discovery, and as the higher
race mind has found new levels of the physical
air and with the aeroplane is carrying his physi­
cal body far beyond the level of the path of the
common man, and with the submarine is seeking
out the plan of the lower kingdoms, just so the
Illuminatus rises into the transcendental king­
dom of his inner selfhood and discovers there
new spheres of intelligence waiting for his con-
There is a table-land of the self, and those
who seek it find it, and those who do not find

And then— there is no darkness in life’s skies,
No night, dear God, no night,
For listening ever to life’s glorious song,
All earth is light— light— light.
He who fasts and goes only as far as the
Novitiate Fast does well and he need not be con­
demned by his own mind, nor hurry to force
himself on into the Illuminati Fast; Eternity is
a long time and the race need not hurry. It
may take an even pace and still short cut a
million years of experience, expression and in­
clusion; but to the one who is ready and who
comes with an unfaltering determination to go
on up the steeps of the highest experiences,
willing even to short cut those who are on the
Novitiate’s short cut, these can come into the
Illuminati Fast with fearless hearts. The past,
the present and the future are one, and they
must be made one in every consciousness some­
time, somewhere. Somewhere we must face our­
selves and all the actions and reactions of our
many desires.
Through the mighty years, with a million fears,
We have waited silently so,
It must bring our own when the night is flown,—
It must let the dawn come through.
There is nothing in all the mighty past of
which we need be afraid. After all, we cannot
face anything but our own desires; why should
we fear in the now the things which our souls
loved in the forgotten past? The brave soul
longs for freedom, balance, more than for any-

thing else; and he will stand with uncovered
head, or kneel in silent consecration, command­

all that is less than freedom for his evolving soul.
There is nothing that can have any power over
a soul victorious; all the elemental consciousness
of many millions of years will sink into oblivion
before the calm determination of an illumined
So, in the wisdom born from on high, the
Illuminatus takes his place in his own universal
setting, he calls from all the past behind him and
from all the future before him, the balance sheet
of his own soul. Then he says in the voice of
the Mighty Silence "By the power that is vested
in me by Thee, Oh God, I command the ele­
ments to fall before my will. God of all the
hosts of heaven, God of angels, God of men,
the light of Thy benediction covers me.”
Instructions for th e Illum inati Fast
When taking the Illuminati Fast, never take
more than two days and nights at first; when
taking the simple fast for illum ination and
prophecy it is well to begin with one night with­
out sleep; after a while, if this leaves you normal,
you may take two nights, only the real mystic
can take three nights. There is never anything
gained by straining for revelation.
Two days and nights is the lim it for the
Novitiate of the spiritual discipline; after that,
sleep and eat to your heart’s content. The Illu­
minati fast should come at the end of the ten-
life

day fast. If it is taken alone without prepara­
tion, it will not do the work that is done at the
close of an ordinary fast. Eat at night on the
eighth day and then neither eat, sleep nor drink
until twelve or three o’clock the morning of the
eleventh day. Twelve o’clock is for those who
feel unable to go farther.
Should this fast seem too hard you should use
you own common sense and stop anywhere that
the strain seems too great. A glass of milk, then
off to bed will cure any sensation you may
contact.
In this fast one often has extended vision and
hearing. Clairvoyance, clairaudience, trance
conditions, suspended animation, are all a part
of the plan. The fast takes the dimness of the
Soul away.
Do not try this fast unless you are not bound
by the old race superstition and fear of the
things of the other world. There are many new
fields of discovery before the one who knows
and is not afraid. There is no danger to the
one who is afraid, for his own fear will send him
to the table or to bed long before anyone is
anxious but himself.
It is in this fast that we became adept with
the mystic mirror and it is in this fast that we
can discover, and afer a while interpret, the
Akashic records, and here is where we learn the
true power of our wireless mind and catch
messages too high to translate into speech.
It is in this fast that we see the White Light
of Reality and can commune, not with the

familiar spirits of the earth plane, but with the
Heavenly hosts and masters of the spheres, and
more than this, through our own transcendency
we become aware of the elemental consciousness
of nature, the masters, the Solar system and the
Solar gods. Forces of earth, air, fire and water
obey our command, for through this Cosmic
awareness they know and love us.
The world is only a mirror in which is re­
flected the other worlds and their inhabitants,
and when we are transcendental enough we see
the reflected worlds of many universes and take
our place, a whirling center of divine intelli­
gence, in accord with the mighty master minds.
From these illumined heights we return to the
normal vibrations of our every day world, but
our soul is filled with the infinite and the joy of
things supernal; our wisdom is not the wisdom
of the human, but the wisdom born of our inti­
macy with what men call God. We can trust
our human mind in our human affairs to the
uttermost because it is God Himself enshrined.
The ILLUMINATI FAST is the short cut of
the "Short Cut”, and we may rise to this con­
sciousness and "be as one who walks a pathway
fashioned from the stars and sheds his light about
him as he goes.”

built by thought. All the fasting of the past
was, to a certain extent, futile just because those
who fasted never knew that they had to destroy
completely the mental picture, before they could
set in a new one. They simply fasted off the flesh
and made a feeble change in mental pressure
without changing the mental image, often ag­
gravating the old emotional conditions without
destroying them.
"Without vision, the people perish” the masters
of the past taught and true it is today. With­

When we fast we must become the true artist
and conceive a new, original thought picture to
paint into flesh and environment. The true
artist strives always to produce the perfect thing
and we, as artists, must strive to produce a per­
fect thing which is not put on canvas nor cut
into stone, but is worked out in our own form.
The expression of a beautiful, perfected self­
hood is our new work and we must have the
perfect conception and perception of this self­
hood before the work can be done.
Is it health you want?
Then, when you fast, hold a mental image of
yourself just as you want to be. Do you want
to change your face or form? Then hold a
changed vision, or the vision of a new type,
while you fast and your friends will pass you
on the street or take you for your younger
brother or sister.
If you cannot build the vision yourself, then
take some picture which in a way fulfills your
idea of a perfect personality. You will not re­
produce this in exact likeness, but in one year
you can put the main characteristics into your
own type.
"That which we see we must become, richer
and richer, breath by breath; im m ortal gain
immortal room.”
Just as the sculptor works on his marble,
cutting away all unsightly turns, just so, with
your mental tools— your thoughts— you must
work on your own vision, shaping it to your

highest ideals.
Hold the vision and fast, then let your own
new body tell the tale to the passerby. It will
set in flesh, just what you have imaged mentally.
If it is in environment you desire a change,
or if it is any other kind of change you desire,
the method is the same. Just hold every day,
all the time, the vision of yourself set in the
situation and conditions which you desire—don’t
make them less in the vision than you really
want. Hold this vision, do with your might
what your hand finds to do; soon the old con­
ditions will begin to change and you will be
face to face with new opportunities and new
privileges.
Any one who will fast once a month under
full instructions, projecting the VISION power­
fully from and in his mind, can, in one year,
and often in less time than this, change his whole
body and environment, bringing himself, out of
impossible conditions, a world of beauty, free­
dom and peace.
The VISION is the beginning and the end of
fasting, even after the fast is over, the one who
lives con stan tly under the vision of health,
wealth, love and service will find that his steps are
led closely in these paths and as he thinks, he is.
The vision is built into our bodies and en­
vironment by the elemental intelligences of the
universal life which our own recognition com­
mands. Cosmic Intelligence is waiting to be
acted upon. We are actors; intelligence must
obey because it is mindless mind, it can only

higher mind, then it gladly obeys our slightest
wish. The way the command carries through
to elemental mind is through the vision we set
and project each day in unchanging creation.
Then fast; hold the vision of your heart’s
desire, work, wait, serve, fast again and again,
project the vision with ceaseless realization, and
one day you will stand face to face with your
heart’s desire in form. The very presence of
your soul’s command in visualized creation will
turn nothing into something for you, for the
law saith "Behold I come quickly and I make
all things new.”

T h e Psychology of th e Breath
* I ' h e life of the body is the blood, and the
life of the blood is the breath. "It is the
breath of the Almighty which gives us Life.”
There are many who seek to be one with all
higher laws and who at the same time fail to
connect with the first im portant law,—con­
scious breathing.
We all breathe involuntarily as well as volun­
tarily,—if it depended on our own consciousness
to establish the rhythm of normal breathing, we
would pass out very quickly. When we see the
flagrant violations of nature’s law of breath we
cannot help wondering at the long suffering
endurance of the defrauded body and the mar­
velous compensation nature laboriously makes.
We do not sin away our day of grace all at
once. Disease of body, mind and soul is not a
thing of a moment’s birth, but is the inevitable
reaction of a long violation of the natural ad­
justments of true being.
The overloaded vital centers, on all planes,
stagger on under the increasing strain thrown
on them through ignorance and actual spiritual
stagnation.
It has taken centuries to know that the direct
[ 6 0 ]

SITY OF MICHIC
T h e S h o r t C u t To R e g e n e r a tio n
road to excretion and nutrition is through the
physical breath. It is a new light on the secrets
of the self to find that there are two avenues of
sustenance by which the race man feeds himself,
on through food and the other through breath­
ing. U ntil man knows how to awaken the
nutrition centers with his breath and make the
breath-call the stimulus to which his cells re­
spond with their im m ediate release of vital
energy, he must take the old man’s method and
waken them through food particles brought to
their nuclei from food passed into his stomach.
With normal lungs we breathe naturally a
certain number of breaths a moment, with defi­
nite inspiratory and expiratory rhythm. This
air, coming from without, is laden with the new
substance which is to be taken into the blood
current through the exchange made in the
blood-vessels of the lungs. The lungs release, in
expiration, all the finer waste products of the
body, they pass out in the form of carbon dioxide
gas and are replaced by oxygen in the inspira­
tory act.
Inhalation and expiration are the tidal waves
of the physical body and the tide rises, falls, falls
and rises, just as regularly as the tide of the sea
in its long, rhythmical roll.
When we shorten the beat between, or when
our expiration and inspiration halt the normal
pulse beat of our body, we gather debris so dense
that after a while we have no space for incoming
breath and no strength to empty our already
overcharged physical spaces.

T h e S h o r t C u t T o
The blood is the carrier of life to the physical
body and it is breath, not food, that keeps the
blood flowing in our veins. It is breath not food,
that purifies the blood streams and keeps new,
fresh, red, oxygenated blood going the rounds
of the human tide. The rise and fall of the
body forms the suction power which sends it
onward laden with its life giving force.
There is always a certain amount of residual
air in the lungs whcih keeps them inflated and
gives the individual a chance to call for more
breath in emergencies, also a chance to let out
more breath if the need is great.
The residual breath is often a source of disease
and nearly always takes a part in the inharmony
of the body. There are many who never really
change the residual air in their lungs; this air
remains like a stagnate pool over which the fresh
air only passes in ineffectual ripples, while it
creams over with the fetid, unexpelled carbon
dioxide gas,—it becomes so completely saturated
with gas that it is sometimes more gas than air
and then we have the fetid breath, the coated
tongue, the yellow biliousness, the "taste in the
mouth” and all the things which have, in the
past, been laid at the door of the intestinal tract
but which really have their origin in the lungs.
The glutton, with his distended stomach full
of food, does not take a normal breath—he can­
not; the drunkard cannot breathe enough for
elim ination, while the sick, puny invalid, to
whom every effort is painful turns wearily away
from the physical effort which enforced breath-
[ 6 a ]

ing entails. There are not ten persons out of
twelve whom one can command to breathe the
true vibratory breath, who can do it for ten
minutes without giddiness, nausea or even a
complete fainting collapse.
This residual air is, in our new understanding,
the seat of all conquest and the source of all
limitation. It must be emptied thoroughly if
it has lost the normal law of exchange; there
is no use trying to breathe on an already over-
inflated lung space, it must be emptied con­
sciously to the very last bit of breath which can
be expelled, then inhalation will be easy and
will bring results.
There are many persons who breathe and
breathe, but do not get results in their flesh,
simply because the normal exchange is not made
within the pulmonary vessels; the cells in the
passing blood stream in the lungs are so satu­
rated with the narcotic of the carbon gas that
they do not release in time to catch the oxygen
as it enters, this is why long, deep respirations,
—holding the inspired breath—is imperative in
most cases. The new oxygenated breath, held
long enough, will force the sluggish cells to re­
lease; and with the next exhalation, the gas is
expelled and oxygen replaces it in the blood.
Twenty-five per cent more oxygen in the
blood current will cure a headache, set indiges­
tion at rest, prevent colds or weariness and give
new inspiration and feeling to mind and body.
The union of conscious breathing and fasting
makes the very quickest exchange possible.
[ 6 3 ]

T h e Short Cut T o Regeneration
When one fasts his respirations quicken natu­
rally, because the muscles becoming weak de­
mand more subjective force, and anything that
calls for more energy in the blood will quicken
the breath and, through this, the flow of the
blood.
Through increased circulation there comes
increased elimination, and through elimination
there comes release of all congested parts; then
from this, arises new nutrition, power and health.
With the new elixir of oxygenated air flowing
into the blood as it passes through the ductless
glands, and the minute occult centers of the
brain and spinal cord, all the very fine activity
of the body is reestablished. The kinetic fluid
of the body is released and new vital life force
immerses every cell of every tissue.
Cosmic Breath is inexhaustible— it is always
waiting to pour into our blood stream. The
ignorant m ultitude simply passes by all these
gifts. We forget that our nostrils are open for
the Breath of Life. To breathe is to give the
body a chance for more life,—life that is full of
exhilaration and strength.

Special D irections For Fasting
"^TThen we are fasting we throw all our
physical machinery out of normal action.
We must therefore give it more attention than
we would otherwise.
Assimilation—Nutrition— Digestion— Elimi­
nation, all struggle under an abnormal condition;
for as soon as we cease eating we lose the stim­
ulation which food gives the system and by
which it takes care of these things.
Our physical food cells die by the thousands,
and must be elim inated quickly or the blood
stream will become filled with decaying sub­
stance which carries with it the touch of ptomain
poisoning. There is no poison more deadly than
ptomain and unless we throw out the waste of
our own flesh we soon become saturated with it.
A systemic cathartic on the day we do not eat
is imperative—there is no use saying "Oh I don’t
need it.” "Yes! you do!” and a local enema
will not do the work. This will only unload the
lower bowel and the need of the system is for
a cleansing of the blood stream, as well as the
intestinal tract. There are plenty of cathartics
which will do the work quietly without disturb­
ing effects.

While fasting, the elim ination through the
pores of the skin is also most important—and
hence good body massage and Turkish baths.
Swimming, electrical baths are also good as they
stimulate the molecular activity of the whole
system.
Body massage loosens the muscles and helps in
breaking up old adhesions and errors of physical
angles— a muscle which is too long will shorten
when released and a too short muscle can be
stretched to its full length.
Hence the change in the shoulder muscles—
round shoulders can be completely cured and
flat chests filled in. Double chins can be oblit­
erated, big, full, and sagging abdominal muscles
shortened; and the body pulled into its normal
shape.

Exercises
Breath as Force— Muscle Tensing,
-with Fasting.
W / h e n we begin to fast, our first attention
is to our flesh structure. We must tear
down our old house of worn-out substances and
gather new material for our new construction
work. The body is always reconstructing itself
but it is too slow a process to fit the whirlwind
consciousness of the new Illuminatus.
Saint Paul said "I die daily” and this is true,
but this death is in the form of a gradual change
of which the individual is more or less uncon­
scious; but with this new death of the flesh
through fasting, the struggling cell consciousness
must be helped out of its place by quick meth­
ods and these methods are breathing and muscle
tensing.
Idle tissue atrophies, a breathless, airless blood
stream putrefies and decays; while both together
form a morgue for the half-dead ego man within
the pulseless body.
As soon as a cell has outlived its usefulness,
it should be cast out; as soon as air is thoroughly
deoxygenized it should be exhaled from the
body. There is no place in the true economy
[ 6 7 ]

of normal flesh for waste material.
It is the retained refuse in the form of urea
and carbon dioxide gas that prematurely ages
the flesh, dulls the mind and causes the whole
being to mature too rapidly.
There is no doubt but that at the root of all
old age of the flesh there are seeds of carbon
products, while fresh air, perfect breath control,
exercise, a limited amount of pure food and
muscle education, is the open secret of rejuve­
nation.
Air and Fire, or Breath and Vibration, which
form the fuel of the flesh, are the most potent
forces of the Illuminatus. The conscious breath,
passed over the lips in a rhythmical breathing,
becomes like a bellows igniting the dry cells
waiting for the spark of higher energy. This
increased vibration of the cell body and circu­
lation starts a violent conflagration in the body
and burns out, like dead leaves, the lingering
waste products.
This conscious control of the breath, with
fasting and muscle tensing, were the mysteries
of the tem ples of Lemuria and Atlantis over
thirty thousand years ago, and those who knew
the law continued their lives thousands of years
in youthful, free, healthy bodies.
Greece caught something of this mystery many
thousand years later as it was repeopled with the
incarnate egos of ancient civilizations and it be­
came a world of artistic wonder.
Under the new method of exercise we con­
serve all our energies, yet have results the old

methods never gave us. This new method is
not alone the normal muscle function, but an
almost abnormal action, brought about through
tension and release. A muscle used and released
will keep normal, an unused muscle atrophies
and an overused muscle hypertrophies. There
is a normal use and disease which must be main­
tained or a weak, dying flesh body results.
In the life of our m odern civilization the
ordinary individual does not use more than two-
thirds of his muscular system, nor does he use
one-third of his lung space. A few important
muscles are made to do all the work, the rest lie
dormant or, at the best, try to urge themselves
upon the attention through lameness, weakness
or stiffness.
Our flesh body is our personality, and our
personality is our presentation card; and by it
the world reads the story of our death or our
abundant life.
Not many people are really proud of their
personality; we outgrow the states of mind that
build it; and, when we have outgrown anything,
nothing connected with it is as beautiful as our
new desire.
The old world never knew that we could
change our personality just as fast as we can
change our desires and that when we have out­
grown a situation or an idea, we can take off
the old face and form which fitted them, and
grow new ones just as easily as a lobster grows
a new claw.
With fasting, breathing, thinking, tensing we

lines of our past thinking and acting, and with
our new wisdom, born from this higher revela­
tion, we get out of Nature’s way and let her
forces order for us a new outfitting, and this
may be of any style or texture we decide. We
are the highest expression of intelligence on this
planet. It is for us to command—all the ele­
mental minds of nature must take our orders,
they cannot choose but obey.

TH E M EN TA L A T T IT U D E is a great
factor in this part of the breath, “As a man
thinketh in his heart, so is he.” One must feel
himself inside his own body, breathing his own
breath out through his flesh just as he would if
his face were covered and he was forced to
breathe the breath through a thick veil. This
is true Regenerative Power. “It is the breath
of the Alm ighty that giveth us life.” This
breath gives us life because it fans to a radiant
flame the latent fires within the being.
The Temple Fires of the Ancients were only
this living fire from within, which is the fire
which consumeth not, yet transmutes the baser
metals into pure gold.
With this divine alchemy, the Illum inatus
melts out the coarser substance and keeps the
Temple fires forever burning beneath his caldron
of immaculate flesh.
NOW TO SUMMARIZE QUICKLY: First
the emptying of the chalice (the lungs); then
long, deep physical breathe until the blood
stream of the body carries a current of crimson
substance charged with the radio-active energy
of the higher vibration; then the breath held
in, yet driven out through the body by an iron
will-force from behind, which is one with the
pressure of the universal Energy. When this
exercise is correctly followed, there will come
a moment when the muscle, bone, brain, spinal
cord and every tissue of the body will glow and
tingle with an energy before unknown, while
the cell nuclei have changed into shimmering
[ 7 2 ]

electrons, holding in their centers the spark
divine. Then, gathering together inside the
pulsing dynamo called the body, sealing all
escapes like a herm etically sealed casket, this
mighty force will escape through the tiny ap­
ertures of the cell body. "Man is not flesh, he
is fire, and at his center burns the flame from
whence he came.” And, as a smouldering fire
burns its way beneath the surface of a field until
at last it bursts forth in the blaze of a flaming
heat, just so the flesh is molten, cleansed, purified,
exalted.
Within this wall of flesh, like a fire in an iron
vault, this conflagration burns itself to white
ashes and expires in the intensity of its own heat
taking with it the waste products in the flesh.
This is the Illuminati Law of REGENER­
ATION and the physical body that is born
from the funeral pyre of the dead flesh can
never know a tomorrow of pain, its day of con­
tent and peace is eternal.
While the breath is being intensified, the
muscular system must be kept en rapport with
the rising vibration and this is accomplished
through tensing.
There is just one instruction needed for the
Initiate here and that is, TE N SE , TE N SE ,
TENSE,—RELEASE your muscles— as you re­
lease your breath;— and TENSE, TENSE,—
again and again. The TENSE muscle is the
vibrant one, and w ith this new activity, the
flesh body keeps pace with the fires of the breath
within; and the release floods the whole body
[ 7 3 ]
Original from
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIC
T h e Short Cut To Regeneration
with the transmuted product of breath, which
is force.
Bring every muscle in the body, deep and
superficial, under the control of the will; twist
— turn—breathe— tense, until like a contortion­
ist every intelligence within your body springs
spontaneously to your command.
The awakened, eager, muscular system casts
off at once all that is clogging response. An
used muscle cannot deposit fat, neither can it
become bound and inert in its sheath.
With this call the muscle juice (myocine) re­
constructs itself, lubricating the whole internal
flesh, while the skin slipes again over every
muscle and becomes a normal excretory channel,
covering, protecting and feeding the tissue be­
neath.
There is no exoteric exercise that will accom­
plish what this esoteric one of breath and tensing
will; it frees the body, exalts the mind, restores
healthy emotions, rejuvenates the whole being,
while it lets the higher concept centers become
unclouded to receive transcendental revelation.
Fasting, Breathing, Thinking, Tensing; this is
the sunrise over our new world. It wipes the
dullness of our old dead cells off our spiritual
horizon like mists from glass and we look out,
clear eyed, over a new kingdom which our own
inspired wisdom has conquered.

intensification of all our human senses. Sight,
hearing, taste, touch and smell awaken with a
new, thrilling sense of finer use, becoming
merged into a vivid new sensation, which is a
blend of all.
All senses are used, not disused, but used in
a sort of overtone of function which perceives
without contact and translates with the deeper
perception of the essence-sense rather than the
crude extracts of the old senses.
Where others see only empty space and hear
no sound and find no perfume, the Illuminatus
rarefied with his Fast, sees colors and visions,
hears voices and merges himself with the music

of the spheres in entrancing sounds.
The faster does not go far in the search for
the secrets of himself before he comes face to
face with the unrevealed secrets of the world in
which he lives—secrets sealed to the masses but
revealed to him because he has pushed his mind
behind the veil of matter in which the common
senses had shut him.
In the very beginning in this search for wis­
dom, he comes to a world of color and sound;
he finds these so wonderful that they bewitch
his senses; the color sinks him into introspection
while the sound either soothes him or jars him
into more and more mystery. When fasting has
opened his vision to the color scheme of the
universe, and his ears to its wonderful harmony,
he must then pass, by higher law, into the added
peace, power and usefullness which these gifts
bring him.
It is a perfectly natural thing for the Illumi­
nati to see colors and hear the vibrations of their
life song. Thousands are born just on the edge
of these deep, etheric vibrations. Clairvoyance
and Clairaudience are just natural expressions
of these intensified states of mind and body.
They are not the gifts of God to some especial
saint or seer, but are the gifts man gives to him­
self through the normal use of the finer senses
already in his possession.
Form, color, sound, this is the trinity of life;
every blade of grass gives off its own keynote,
or life song, as a tuning fork gives out its notes;
every mineral, animal, or man, everything, sings
[ 7 6 ]

its own song of life.
The metaphysician only hears, but does not
understand; the occultist hears, sees and studies
all these laws, but they operate on him, not he
on them. The Illum inatus sees, knows and
operates all these laws, blending them into one
grand whole, from which he writes the sym­
phony of his own life.
Within this extension of vision and sense there
comes the wonder of the sense of smell, and the
Illuminatus detects everywhere the auric smell of
all things: he can speak as one who speaks with
authority even before he has either seen or heard;
he can walk, blindfolded, in the most dangerous
levels, be surrounded with the beasts of the
human plane and yet, with an unerring subtlety,
his finer sense of smell will open the truth for
him and become the book of wisdom from which
he can read the directions of the trail.
Every one carries with him, in his aura, the
finer etheric vibrations of his life; and these,
translated into smell, reveal his place in the
scheme of all things. The drunkard, the pros­
titute, the thief, the liar, the glutton, the mur­
derer, at heart, all have the odor of their own
vibration, and no matter how beautiful they
may appear externally, no matter how much
they deceive the uninitiated, the Illuminatus can
stand before them, or across the room, or even
with a wall between, and by the almost imper­
ceptible perception of his higher sense of smell
can gain the truth of their soul position.
It has not entered into the heart of man to
[ 7 7 ]
Origi

conceive of the glories that are prepared for
those who love the Lord (Law). The higher
Law of Understanding is always a lamp to his
feet, the wonderful senses of our physical body
are linked with the wisdom of the universe; and
through these, the higher consciousness leads,
directs and inspires the human heart.
Sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell,—these to­
gether form the life line for the whole human
race. Blest indeed is he who, turning inward
for his light, finds that intensified union of all
these senses which can lead him fearlessly along
the sharpest precipices of life. Then thrice
blessed is he when, turning into the world around
him, he can use these to help humanity on to
higher mastery of its environment and itself.
This consciousness attained by taking the
Short Cut—makes for physical, mental, and
emotional everlasting efficiency. Those who
bring it to bear upon human conditions heal
themselves and others, they change their en­
vironment and turn a lamp to the feet of the
struggling, they help all to get health, wealth,
love and success, not tomorrow nor next year
but here and now. These are the real magicians,
but men unthinkingly call them financiers,
builders, promoters, et cetera. Their thoughts,
wished out into form, make a fit place for the
weaker multitude to live in and they are always
the humanitarians, giving their life for the world.

CHAPTER X III
T h e Super-Ma n
" D e fo r e we start to fast, we ask why we should
fast, and after we have fulfilled all the laws
for the Short Cut we have a right to demand
that we shall have, as a permanent possession,
some things that are worth while.
We have followed for an ultimate good and
we demand that the end shall justify the means.
The H um an Mind is so constituted that no
effort, sacrifice or endurance is too great if it
brings the desired end and aim; so the Initiate
may well ask "What is in all this for me? What
is the complete reward? What do I get to re­
compense me for the many human indulgences
I am obliged to pass up in my search for the
Higher Good?”
There is pleasure in self-indulgence, that one
cannot deny, and there is hard discipline in this
ceaseless round of self-denial and self-education.
The Initiate will go on to accomplishment if
he can have positive proof of the certainty of
perfect fulfillment at the end. These proofs can
be given and are given him. He can find them
everywhere in song and story; history itself
stands laden with the gifts of this new world.
The final gift to the one who faints not is

Divine Revelation. With this SHORT CUT
one becomes a Revelator and he has the light of
higher wisdom over his path. The master said
“He that followeth me shall not walk in dark­
ness; he shall have the light of life” and those
who develop this consciousness within, escape
the dark miasma-laden swamps of human ignor­
ance and walk in a light that is not only over
all but in all.
The mind of the Illuminatus is ever the open
doorway betw een heaven and earth through
which genius passes; his plus-consciousness con­
tacts with planes of intelligence unknown to the
simple multitudes; he moves upon the same
levels as his kind, but is above and beyond them
in thought and perception. He eludes, by his
own revelation and greatness, the measuring
power and the submerging pull of the common
crowd. The com m on man can only catch
glimpses of the true light of revelation, the plus
man lives it, is it, and through being this he can
help the whole world.
Through fasting, breathing, thinking, feeling,
being, we become individualized gods on this
planet and can enter the eternal Orders of
Health, Wealth, Love and Service, then, like a
mighty magnet, draw others into these Orders.
Those who pay the price of purification, disci­
pline— which the Short Cut demands, will find as
their ultimate possession and reward a new con­
sciousness w hich embodies in super-hum an
powers.
Nothing in the common walks of life can
[ 8 0 ]

Regeneration T hrough Fasting
interfere with the progress of these Illuminati;
limitation is unknown to them. They simply
absorb or dissolve the puny human laws which
bind and hold the ordinary race man by meeting
them with a perception which finds the higher
laws.
With the higher laws of life they enter natu­
rally into a new order of possession so great, so
limitless, so free, that it can only be called divine:
"They come to grief and bid it pass to joy,
Their touch unbinds the blinding bands of pain;
The soul finds happiness without alloy,
They turn all seeming loss to greater gain.”
This is the fulfillment of the promises, and
by their deliberate appeal to the power of higher
knowing and their unchanging response to higher
discipline they command and accomplish all.
The plus man does not separate himself from
his kind; he is only more closely identified with
everything. His exiled human heart has only
lost its life on a lower plane to find it on new
levels of living. He is now at home on the bosom
of reality; he can speak from the wisdom of the
all, merged in the all, the parts made perfect in
the whole.
The true growth of the human soul is pain­
less, and, knowing this, he turns his transcenden­
tal consciousness upon his flesh and heals it. Pur­
ified by his long fast, the cell consciousness of
his body accepts the new invitation to peace and
freedom. Every cell intelligence awakens to the
new call, and night and day, works out tri­
umphantly, the plus body.

Then, standing in the midst of the world of
intelligence, himself a creator, a receiver, a dis­
tributor and an unfolder, he builds his own mat­
erial world and says—"let there be light over his
new u niverse.” He is universal intelligence,
substance and force. He knows that he must
manifest his own form, and that, in order to
manifest it, he must command the Divine In­
telligence around him.
By a conscious fling of mentation, then, he
speaks his own desire into atomic mind of matter,
and from empty, formless space, cosmic con­
sciousness appears in forms of wealth, success,
power, freedom,— anything he desires.
There is concerted action between the atomic
mind of substance and the mind of the Illumined.
They become the Supreme Creator and Director
of their own pathway through life, and through
contact with the higher levels of Intelligence,
their revelation enables them to be a redeemer
of the race.
Nations may come and go, wax strong and
perish into nothingness but, still higher than the
changing law of time and ignorance, there will
always be the voice of the Eternal Truth speak­
ing its message into the minds of Illumined men.
Amid the world throng there will always be
those, who, pushed by the power of a glorified
conviction, will lift their life to the level of the
universal life, so that, from the shores of in­
finite wisdom, great waves of truth, illumination
and revelation will beat in upon them.
Above all the seeming lim itation s o f our
[ 8 2 ]
Original from

human consciousness and our lim ited under­
standing, revelation and prophesy will sweep into
the soul when we have fulfilled the law, and up­
lift our mind to a great endeavor.
The voice of the Infinite is calling us today,
just as it has called to men of all races through­
out all time, and as soon as the human mind
looks up and seeks and asks, it finds. The answer
is already written; waiting for that supreme
crest in race consciousness when, like a mountain
peak, the rising intelligence unites with its source.
In the everyday life, we must all pass between
the world of sense and the world of revelation.
The Novitiate and the Initiate are side by side,
and each takes his place in, and works with, the
power of his own kingdom, and through this
reaches complete Illumination.
Whenever or wherever the soul awakens to a
great thirst for higher wisdom, it overcomes the
limitations of the finite laws and counts as
naught the self culture which these higher pos­
sessions demand of it.
This, then, is the Short Cut, the pathway of
the plus man, the new world of the Illuminati. It
is filled with eternal possessions and any life, no
matter where it may be in the lesser pathways
or the broad, white ways of human ignorance,
can find this straight and narrow path and build
itself a way from the lowlands of human reality,
into a new world of peace.
Crowned, then, with the joy of deeper con­
quest which we have won through unfaltering
allegiance to the laws of the "Short Cut;” we
[ 8 3 ]

hold in our hands the key to the secrets of Ab­
solute Creation.
The path began by awakening within the self
an embryonic Consciousness of Divine Reality,
and it ends with reality coming forth not from
some strange, far-off outside world of conjec­
ture, but gently and surely from the very heart
of life within our own being. From our own
center, life’s perfect flower of Divine Realiza­
tion has budded, bloomed and blossomed. We
are no longer under the law of the race con­
sciousness but under the grace of Divine poten­
tialities and possibilities.
