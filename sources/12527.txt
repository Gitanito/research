It all happened in an instant - I remembered my whole life and what I had done. It is a very peaceful feeling, (besides from the trauma of almost drowning) everything was very relaxed and calm. It felt like I was underwater at least ten minutes before I blacked out, but only two minutes had actually passed. Then I could feel nothing; like my brain wasn't working at all, for I don't how long. Then suddenly with a flash of white light, I came to as I was being pulled out of the water but I could not see anything but white light for five minutes. Afterwards everything just looked new to me, like the trees and grass and everything looked so much brighter and vibrant for a day at least. Now I feel so much better about life, like the event changed the way I feel.
