There was no time or dimension. It was very clear but not dazzling; the light was good. The light was everywhere and at the same time full of love and happiness. It's hard to describe with human words because the human world seems to me now so small and limited. Where I was, there existed everything you need for happiness. It was good emotionally; I did not feel any pain or depression which I had been suffering before this event. Everything was so good and awe-inspiring at the same time, but not amazingly complex. On the contrary, it seemed to me that I belonged to this world and it was quite natural that I should have found it in August, when I did. 

I remember the moment when 'I returned' to this body. I did not want that. I wanted to stay there, where there was love and the vastness of good. My body was full of pain and such. Everything after returning seemed to me small and limited. Things hurt. Even every heartbeat which you never thought about was associated with pain. It hurt me too much in the left hemispheres of the brain, with an ophthalmic migraine (migraine ophtalmique fra.) The tubing they placed in my nose for oxygen made my nose ache. I was not happy.  I felt that I was wrong to return. In the first few moments, everything was mingled.  For instance, the time when I was unconscious and the present. However, I was and am sure it happened; it was not a dream. It really happened. I had and I still have sometimes beautifully colorful dreams but the difference between them and an NDE is not comparable. I was there and no one can convince me otherwise.

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Christian- Catholic

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       Uncertain     I am still a practitioner but pray differently. I think this experience dispelled all, even the smallest doubts, about the existence of God. It seems to me also that you do not need to be 'holy' to achieve eternal life. I think now, that God gives man more slack than I believed before.

What importance do you place on your religious/spiritual life after your experience?       Slightly important to me

What is your religion now?       Christian- Catholic

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?       Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     Because life does not end with the moment of death. Because there is a 'vast intelligence' that created the world and guides us. Our brain is too limited to understand it. This intelligence can be called God. There is something great and grand, and good.

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?       Large changes in my life     I do not pray to God to take care of my loved ones or to watch over them. Now I pray not to suffer. If you die (my cousin just died) I know that there, it is happier than here. I'm not afraid of death but of suffering. From mundane things, Iâ€™ve observed I have the impression that I started a new life. I'm not totally depressed though still I take drugs on the advice of my doctor. I do not smoke cigarettes although I was a great smoker. Tobacco smell bothers me as if I never smoked.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        Yes I'm more forgiving. Anyone can do what he or she consider appropriate, and I do not mind.  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   My sister found me unconscious in my house. I was lying on my back and was told that my saliva blocked the esophagus and lungs. I could not be awakened. An ambulance was called. I did not respond to attempts to awaken me. I regained consciousness after 3-4 days in the hospital.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Unbelieving

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     I sometimes wish my sister hadn't called the ambulance and that I remained there; I sometimes have a little regret.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     I read a lot about this and I see that I am not alone. As I read of or hear people telling their experiences, I get goose bumps

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I feel perfectly well!!! Much better than before the experience; both physically and mentally.

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       What changed concretely and physically in your life after the experience?  I got rid of depression and no longer feel like smoking cigarettes.
