         Experience  description:   &nbsp;&nbsp;     </b>

Pam is 45 year old.&nbsp; She met her soul mate 15 years ago when she was 30.&nbsp; He was 18.&nbsp; The experience when they met was one of profound recognition.&nbsp; The first time they saw each other they felt they were not strangers.&nbsp; 'It is hard to explain but I felt like we had always known each other.&nbsp; I knew he was IT'&nbsp;

However, given the age difference and the circumstances at the time, it was inappropriate to pursue the possibility of any kind of relationship, particularly love or sexual.&nbsp; Pam chose to stand back and watch her soul mate grow and grow up.&nbsp; 'It was the most painful experience knowing that we could not be together.&nbsp; I yearned for him.&nbsp; I yearned for him for 6 years until it got to the point that I had to move away from him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I moved to another part of California and cut myself off.'&nbsp;

I had other relationships but nothing ever matched up to what I had experienced with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still thought about him and missed that level of connection that I knew was possible.&nbsp; He was the only person I have ever met who I had felt totally comfortable with.&nbsp; In his presence I can be totally who I know myself to be. This year, when I turned 45, I decided that I could not continue to live my life without knowing the answer to the question:&nbsp; 'Is he really my soul mate?&nbsp; If I found him again, would it feel the same?'&nbsp; I had to know. &nbsp;

So I went back to the place where I had lived before, not knowing where he was or whether he would still be there.&nbsp; But he was still there.&nbsp; He had been married but his marriage had ended. He was now 33.&nbsp; When we saw each other again, it was amazing. The feelings we had experienced before were still there.&nbsp; The first thing he said to me was: 'Why did you leave me? How could you have gone away?'&nbsp; He had had the experience of never finding that level of connection with anyone else.&nbsp;

We were at peace again.&nbsp; Now I know we will always be together. Being apart now is very difficult, especially for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He harbours fears that I will abandon him again.&nbsp; We find it hard to be apart.&nbsp; &nbsp;

For me, meeting a soul mate is a feeling of being totally comfortable with who you are in their presence.&nbsp; We have an extraordinary level of communication but we can also just 'be' together without even having to talk.&nbsp; It is not a physical experience although passion is definitely present. But lust shifts the focus to a physical thing.&nbsp; When you are with your soul mate it is more to do with the 'essence'.&nbsp; It is as though everything gets reduced to an essence, a single potent concentrated drop.&nbsp; And you recognise that essence in each other. &nbsp;

Needless to say I was so moved by Pam's story and I acknowledged the courage it had taken for her to go back and to search again for her soul mate.&nbsp; She had no idea what she might find by going back but could no longer live her life without knowing the answer to the question: Should they be together?&nbsp;

Now they have rekindled the spark of their relationship.&nbsp; The fire had never gone out.&nbsp; Pam shared with me that at age 45 she is pregnant and will be having his baby.&nbsp; They have decided to call the child 'Aidan', a Gaelic, Middle English name that means 'Little Fire'.
