I did have a lot of heartburn. I woke up with severe heartburn at 12:30 am. I turned on my left side and waited for it to go away but it got worse. At some point I decided it was a heart attack so I tried my best to relax, I don't know why. The pain became very strong. Then the pain went away. I searched for signs of breathing – nothing; signs of a heartbeat - nothing. Absolutely no feelings of pain or worry but my mind was working. As time went on I became very happy, filled with joy. It was extremely dark, no sound no senses, nothing except my mind. I was not concerned about my family or anything. My thoughts were, I have died, and I will be the first in my extended family to find out what comes after death. I was so happy.

I began to leave my body when slam I was back in my body with pain, and hurt and worry. My sheets and body were soaked wet and the pain was back. When I went to a cardiologist, he confirmed to me that I had a heart attack.

I have now had bypass surgery and I am on lots of heart medication. My personality has changed; I am so much more relaxed - mellow. It has caused a serious change in me that everyone in my circle has noticed. I lost all fear of death. The death experience is painless and joyful.
