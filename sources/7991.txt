  		              		Experience Description   

    I stopped breathing during a phone call, late at night.  The other person called people to resuscitate me.  I was out of my body by this time and watching the resuscitation efforts.  I was actually above the ceiling and looking down at events.  I was engulfed by a warm, yellowish glow.  I knew that I had crossed over and felt totally at ease.  I realized that  the answer to all questions was 'it doesn't matter.'  Things only matter while you're alive.  When you've crossed over, all worldly issues 'don't matter.' At some point, I was back in my body.
