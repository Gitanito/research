  		              		Experience Description:   

  				  I woke up above my body, and I was still having electrical thoughts. I felt like I was in the shape of a clear ball, and the back of me was connected to some type of electrical force, that was using me, but not hurting me. I never thought this was the afterlife at the time, but after analyzing it now, I can see how it could be. I was surprised how I could move around, by just wanting too. The pressure of going back into my body was rough, but I was hoping it would all work out in the end, and it did.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     After my brother died in 2005, I decided to use my experience to try and figure out a way where we can communicate with future out of body people in a way that can be measured, and now I believe I know how we can do it.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       Please listen to my theory, give me some input, and if you believe in it, like I do, help me make it a reality.
