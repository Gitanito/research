One friend was pulling another and myself in a wagon. Another friend was running side by side chasing the wagon down a sidewalk. I tripped and started to fall. The second I hit the ground I saw myself from about one hundred and fifty feet in the air. I could see everything looking straight down. The tops of the trees, the top of my house, myself and my friend running. It was all in a freeze frame. It felt like I was looking down on everything for about five to seven solid seconds. It was like looking at a photo. There was no fear of being high in the sky, just a freeze frame as if time stopped. I could still feel it was a good period of five to seven seconds that I was looking down.

As soon as it was over, I felt myself on the ground and looked forward thinking my friends were further ahead because of the time lapse. In fact, the person running next to me was still right next to me and the wagon and friends were only a couple of steps ahead. It was almost as if the looking down part never took up any time. I was surprised and just stood up very confused. I looked over at my parents, who were outside talking to neighbors to see if they witnessed what I did. They noticed nothing other than me tripping and falling. I didn't hit my head or anything like that. I simply fell to my hands and knees. I remember telling my friends about it and I think they thought I was crazy. I clearly remember this because it frightened me! What does this mean?
