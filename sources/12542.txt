  		              		Experience Description   

    It was 1963 and I was in the last month of my pregnancy with  my third baby. I had pre-eclampsia and my blood pressure had skyrocketed. I spent four weeks in hospital. Four days before my baby was due, they decided to induce me. I had gone through four hours of labor when the doctors started to panic because the baby was in the wrong position. They sedated me to turn the baby.  

  I am confused about what went on afterwards. The next thing I knew, I was looking down at the bed from a corner of the room. Two doctors and several nurses were around the bed. I could see that two of them, at the head of the bed, had bags of blood. I saw my body as a 'thing' in the bed and not important.  What was more important was in another corner of the room. I could hear a baby crying and I looked across the room. I saw a crib with my baby screaming and unattended. I was concerned as nobody was taking care of him.  I became agitated and furious. I was in the corner one moment and the next moment I was back in the bed in a semi-conscious state.
