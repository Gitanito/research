There was an overwhelming feeling of joy and peace. Time as we know it didn't seem to exist. I felt like I was taken on an emotional journey of the joy of my childhood.

Background Information:

Gender:	 Male

Date NDE Occurred:	  October

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes  Illness    'Life threatening event, but not clinical death'   I had fallen into a deep coma, due to severe illness. I had an unknown form of acute hepatitis, and urgently needed a liver transplant. I was unconscious for a week and doctors had estimated I had less than a day to live. I was put to the top of the transplant list in England. Luckily a liver became available, the transplant was performed and I made a full recovery.

How do you consider the content of your experience?      Wonderful

Did you feel separated from your body?    No    I lost awareness of my body

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?      More consciousness and alertness than normal   As above.

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       I was unconscious and in a coma throughout the entire experience, though I felt like I.

Were your thoughts speeded up?       Incredibly fast

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning

Were your senses more vivid than usual?       Incredibly more vivid

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.     It was almost like I could see emotions, vision in the traditional sense did not exist. It was as if another dimension existed and it was so far from what we experience day to day that I cannot describe it accurately.

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    Sound and sight didn't exist in the sense that we know them.

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere?     Yes, and the facts have been checked out

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you see any beings in your experience?       I actually saw them

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       No

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?       A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin

Did you see an unearthly light?       No

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     The entire experience was completely extra dimensional and not comparable to life as we know it.

The experience included:       Strong emotional tone

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       Overwhelming joy and peace that I have never felt before or since the experience.

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?       Incredible peace or pleasantness

Did you have a feeling of joy?       incredible joy

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?     I felt united or one with the world

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe

The experience included:       Life review

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control     I have not feared death since the experience. I feel like the experience made me a more laid back person.

Did scenes from the future come to you?       Scenes from the world's future

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will     

God, Spiritual and Religion:

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Liberal   Catholic

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       No

What is your religion now?       Liberal   Catholic

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       No

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?       I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?       I actually saw them  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    No

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        No   

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      Yes   The experience was so overwhelming that words cannot accurately portray it. There is nothing comparable to the experience in day to day life.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I shared the experience as soon as I woke from my coma. People are not very interested because they probably assume it was just like a dream.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Yes   I was aware that they occurred.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     I viewed it to be definitely real because it happened. I don't understand this question.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     Again, it happened to me and therefore it was real, I don't understand the question.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No   Nothing comes close.

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       I do not understand the questions concerning the reality of the experience. By definition an NDE is an experience and therefore it is real.
