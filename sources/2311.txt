PREFACE.
Tai: substance ofthe present pamphlet wasprepared originally with a view to publication
in one of the daily papers of this city. But as it formed an article of considerably greater
length than we could reasonably expect !he Editor of a daily paper to afford room for, as it
might, moreover, provoke a reply from !orne quarter, and as the views which it embodies
are regarded as too important to be suppressed, the writers determined on publishing it in
its present ii:>rm. They have not attempted to give a complete analysis of the!le pre11tRded
" Revelations," for that would require too much time, besides being quiee unnecessary as.
this brief review will ehow. The principal reasons which have led them to notice this
singular book in the manner and under the aspect they have, are, lst. Because·the name of
Swedenborg occurs quite often in the volume, and has been repeatedly mentioned in connec-
tion with it in notices of the work which have appeared in several public journals. 2. Be-
cauee we believe that the book contains monstrous errors, whose infiuence on the eommu-
nity we would fain do something to avert. 3. Because we think the writings of Swede11-
borg alfored the only satisfuctory explanation of this singular phenomenon, at the same time
that they lead us to expect, under all the circumstance!', just such a mixture of truth and
lhlsehood as this book contains, and show us the reason of it. To these reasons we would
add our settled conviction, that even infidel publi~tions had better be always met and an-
swered by fair argument and solid ·tacts, rather than be passed by in silence, or assailetl
with the poor but oft-selected weapons of denunciiition and abuse. This is the best way,
we think, to extract the poi80n from the serpent's tOOth, or to render it powerless for evil. A
rta10fl4ble public have a right to demand some rational ~ution of the mystery involved in
this strange publication. 'fo call it weak, or wicked, or other harder names, and leave it
where it is, may be sufficient for some minds, but will not satisfy the more sensible or en-
quiring class. Most heartily, therefore, do we concur with a writer in one of our eastem
papers: who, in a recent notice ofthis book, says: .. It will be read, and ougM to be met,
not by mere scolding and denunciation; for that, whether from the College, the Conventicle,
or the Vatican, will be merely laughed at; not by toaying that it is a wicked book, and none
but wicked people will read it ; hundreds of people will read it so much the more : but by
showing that part of the pretended Revelation is false and absurd, and of course, that it is
altogether without authority."-We have attempted this, and more than this ;-have at•
tempted (with what success our readers must judge} to acc0tmt in some rational manner fOI'
the falsities and absurdities which the book contains. But we have not, neither do we, can
in question the honesty or sincerity of the parties concerned in getting it up. We have not,
neither do we, deny or doubt the eubstantial truth of the Scribe's Introduction. And as to

the Clairvoyant himself, we have been led from the slight acquaintance we have had with
him, to fonn a favorable estimate ofhis honesty, benevolence, simple-heartedness and natural
amiability. What his religious fu.ith is in his normal state, or whether indeed he has any
very clearly defined, we are not able to say. 1 We have reasons for believing, however, that
it ie unsound, or deficient, and perhaps both. The Scribe in his Introduction tells us that he
is " disconnected from all sects, parties, creeds, and denominations, and governed solely by
his o~ intuitiat11." Ifthis be indeed the fuct, which we are not disposed to doubt, and if
young Davis bas no faith in any Divine Revelation but that of Nature, it is not difficult to
account for the theology of bis book. The teachings of Swedenborg would lead us to expect
from 1vch a clairvoyant-one who is " governed 1okly by his own intuitions," pl'Qeisely such
views of the Bible as we find in this volume. Those in the other world-and there are
doubtless many such-who have deified and worshipped " the Principles of Nature," and
listened to none but " Her Divine Revelations," would find in this young man a congenial
spirit, and a fit subject in hiir abnormal state through WhQIIl to communicate just such " Rev-
elations'' and such a system of theology as his book contains. Indeed, from what we know
of the doctrine of Spheres, of Influx, and of the great law of Spiritual Affinity which pre-
sides over the intercourse ofspirits with each other as well as with men on earth, if the book
had contained any different or truer views of the Scripture than those we find in it, we
might have had more difficulty than we now have in accounting for the fact.
We concede, then, the alleged genesis of the book, the honesty of those concerned in its
production, and the naturally amiable and unsophisticated character of the clairvoyant ; and
we venture in the following pages to propound a theory, furnished us by Swedenborg, which
we trust may help to account in a rational and satisfactory manner for the strange mingling
oftruth and error which we find in this volume. And we would here add, that, if any one
has a better theory to offer on the subject, we hope he will not fail soon to allow us and the
public generally the opportunity ofconsidering it.

EXAMIN ATIO~, &c.
THE work, to an examination of which the ensuing pages are devoted, has
recently come forth among the novel developments in which the present age is
so prolific. It is a singular specimen of the singular phenomena of Mesmer-
ism. It is the crowning marvel of a class of psychological facts, which, after a
rough encounter with the stubborn incredulity of the world, may be said to have
vindicated their claims to the character of reality with at least a large portion of
thinking minds in every grade of society. Though far transcending in their
manifestations the sphere of tl;>.e natural, and leaving all ordinary philosophy at
fault in the attempt to proffer a satisfactory solution, still the facts have pressed
themselves upon the senses of mul~itudes with such overwhelming urgency of
appeal, that skepticism the most inwterate_
has been silenced, and the convic-
tion become widely established, that a uew world -of influences from the spi-
ritual realms of the universe, is here opened upon us in which alone a clew is
to be found to the causes of the phenomena in question. A new phasis of the
action of mind upon mind has been distinctly revealed in the Mesmeric devel-
opments, and the only ground on which the promiuent facts alleged can be
denied, is the ground which involves the great laws of human testimony in
governing the belief of mankind. The theory of fraud, collusion, imposture,
after weighing the facts in its balance, has itselfbeen weighed and found~­
ing. It will not solve the problem, and if anything more were needed its
total discomfiture, it would be the immense and irresistible array of testimo x.
which goes to establish the preternatural origin of the work before us.
Indeed, were the evidence on this head less conclusive than it is, we should
deem our time and labor very ill bestowed even in the task of exposing its
errors aud falshies. But it is not to be disguised that a prodigy wholly unparal-
leled in the history of the human mind meets us in the present case. If it be
possible to establish any fact by an unimpeachable competency of proof, we
hesitate not to aver that we have, in this volume, replete with deep philosophi-
cal speculation and the most varied knowledge, the emanation of the mind of
an illiterate yomh of twenty, given forth by a process of dictation in a state arti-
ficially induced, and ranging over a vast field of subjects of which he was and
is, in his normal state, utterly and absolutely ignorant, except so far as the sub-
sequent perusal of his own work has made him acquainted with them !
In a fact like this we find an ample apology for entering upon the task which
we have proposed to ourselves, ·of instituting a rigid inquest into the intrinsic
merits and demerits of this :remarkable production. Assuming its genuineness

on the score of origin-a claim which appears to be extensively conceded it by
the public-it is obvious that the general propensity to confound the preternat-
ural with the supernatural, and the supernatural with the Divine, must clothtl the
work with a pre-eminent power of harm, provided ~s teachings on the most
mom~utous themes are- at variance with truth. This effect will be greatly en-
hanced by the imposing title of " Revelations" under which the book ushers
itself into the world. Without, however, paringthis term to the quick, or ascrib-
ing to the book the intention of arraying itself formally or by implication, against
any prior revelation, it must still be confessed to bear on its face the import of a
communication from a higher sphere of intelligence, and it is doubtless from
this fact that it has, from its outset, challenged so large a share of the public
attention. This circumstance alone would warrant the subjection of any work
of the kind to the ordea1 of the strictest scrutiny; more especially if it shall be
found, on examination, to be in conflict, in any respect, with oracles which the
world has long agreed to regard as divine and infallible. That this is the case,
in the present instance, is capable of the clearest demonstration, and when it is
considered that the volume is meeting an unexampled sale-that it is finding its
way to the bosom of a very wide public-that its influence, for good or for ill,
bids fair to tell upon large masses of mind in every variety of state-it will be
easy to justify the anxiety which prompts the present publication. Add to this
that the parties more immediately concerned are about starting a weekly or
monthly paper designed to be the o:rgau of propagating the doctrines contained
in this volume, and that Lecturers are soon to go abroad over the land proclaim-
ing the Gospel af Nature, and " her Divine Revelations," and it will not be
doubted that a loud call is made for a faithful expose of the intrinsic character
of a work which is to constitute t~ basis of a new dispensation.
That this task should have been voluntarily assumed by us will not probably
be surprising to any one who has read the work and noticed the manner in
which Swedenborg and his revelations are spoken of by the " Poughkeepsie
Seer." Although the general tone of his'.allusions to this distinguished man is re-
spectMJJ and honorary, yet we propose to show that they are calculated greatly
.to mislead the reader as to the true character of his teachings and of the relation
which they sustain to the doctrines set fonh in the present volume. As the
writings of Swedenborg have as yet made themselves known hut to a very
limited circle of the readers of Davis, they will be apt, unless otherwise advised,
to accept his statements respecting them as true. It is certain, however, that
these statements are, on some leading points, extremely erroneous, and we
feel bound, in our pt1blic character of receiversand expounders of Swedenborg's
doctrines, to disabuse the community, who may not have access to other means
of information, of the false impressions on this score, which the book is calcu-
lated to produce. We are the more readily induced to enter upon this eclair-
cissement from two considerations ;-(1.) We are in hopes to be able to present
an adequate solution of the psychological problem involved in the case-one
which shall admit all the positive truth embraced in the book, and at the same
time unfold the source of its errors. (2.) We are imprei;ised by the fact that the
present is no isolated case. A multitude of similar phenomena, though for the
most part lesa striking perhaps, are revealing themselves 011 every side, and if

• we mistake not, the indications are rife of a grand demonstration about to be
made, or now being made, of the most pernicious delusions breaking forth from
the world of spirits upon the world of men. In these circumstances we cannot
but feel that the time has arrived for the attempt to lift up a standard against
the incoming flood of falsities, and this we are persuaded can only be done by
a clear exhibition of Swedenborg's teachings on this subject. He has at once
unfolded the true nature of the. delusions in question, and supplied the requisite
safeguards. In this way and no otherdo we recognize any relation between the
two classes of disclosures. ,
In such an attempt we regard it as utterlyidle to deny the main 'facts asserted,
whether in the case of Davis or of his numerous compeers in the same line of
Mesmeric extase. The evidence on this head is too overwhelmingly abundant
to admit of reasonable doubt, and in our discussion of the subject we shall
waste little time in arguing the question of the genuinmua of the present work.
To say nothing of 011! personal acquaintance with the parties concerned, and
our full assurance oftheir general character·for uprightness and veracity-noth-
ing of their-own incompetency to such a production, which we can intimate
without invidious reflection, as they have themselves made the same acknow-
ledgment-nothing of the huge incredibility of such a fraud being concocted
and successfully carried through in the midst of this community, and yet not the
slightest clew obtained to its prime movers, who must have been at once some-
what numerous, profoundly learned, and detestably unprincipled-we de~m
the claims on this head unequivocally established, first, by the amount of testi·
mony accumulated in the Introduction from the most respectable sources, not
one iota of which has yet been impul{lled, and which, at the same time, is so
easy of refutation if false; and, secondly, by the circumstance that the matter is
reduced, even upon the admission of opponents, to the simple alternative of
human or superhuman dictation, i.e. dictation from men in this world or of spirits
in the other. The fact that the entire work came proximately from the lips of
Davis neither is nor can be, denied by any one who has duly weighed the
evidenee. It is expressly conceded by Prof. Lewis, the most unsparing de-
nouncer ofthe whole affair as a "shameless imposture." As then the work came
confessedly from Davis' mouth,the only question is, how it came into his mind.
Prof. L. contends tl:.at it was committed to memory and recited verbatim.
Strangely regardless of the difficulties which render such an hypothesis absurd,
and disdaining to bestow the slightest attention upon the testimony to powers
and performances onthe part of the clairvoyant which make the present achiev.
ment credible, he contents himself with suggesting how the work might have
been produced, when the real question is, bow it wa1 produced-i. e. the question
of the validity of the evidence so largely proffered on this head. All this he un-
ceremoniously sets asideby sayingin reply to what he terms " the mostabsurd
question, (how absurd 1) Whencecame th.ebook 'r'-" we neither know nor care, so
longasa greatmany probable suppo11itions maybestated, each more crediblethan
anything which involves its preternatural origin!" That is to say, no matter what
amount of testimony may be adduced. in support of any alleged preternatural
fact-no matter how excellent and unimpeachable the general charac\er of
the witnesses-yet they are evidently unprincipled liars and their testimony

• DAVIS' REVELATIONS
worthless, because they testify to a fact contrary to all prior experience, and
because various other hypotheses may be resorted to, which, although they do·
indeed outrage all the laws of human testimony, yet they save the uniformity of
the divine operations, and exclude the impious idea that one generation of men
may enjoy a higher light than their predecessors ! This is certainly a remarka-
ble specimen of evangelical logic. It is in fact precisely the reasoning of Hume
against the admission of the miracles of Christ and his Apostles, and we have
the singular spectacle of a Christian advocate staving off the pretensions of an
all!'lged infidel work by weapons drawn from an infidel armory! Yet to this
charge, as urged on former occasions, the only reply is, a burst of holy horror
at the blasphemy of even presuming to compare the two cases; as if it were not
perfectly legitimate to show how the same logical principles bear when applied
to two different subjects-how a rule of reasoning, if held to be valid in one
case, will infallibly be fatal in the other.
Declining then to argue further with a theory which deems it proper to set
aside an impregnable body of proof simply because it fonfiicts with precon-
ceived opinion, we shall assume as indubitable the asserted origination of the
book. As there is no other possible alternative than that of the preternatural
suggestion or the memoriter recitation of its contents, we hesitate not to adopt
the former as far.the easiest solution of the two, especially as the same testi-
mony which ascertains the delivery at all of the Lectures by Davis, certifies also
that hundreds of paragraphs were extemporaneously uttered by him, of a wholly
incidental nature, which are not embodied in the volume. With the exception
of Prof. L. himself, who listened to a single Lecture, the scores of witnesses,
from time to time in attendance, .will <?De and all testify their unqualified con-
viction, that not one page of the 800 before us was, or could have been, under
the circumstauces, recited from memory.
A! then it is beside our purpose to call in question the origin claimed for the
book, so neither do we feel disposed to speak slightingly of its contents. While
we recognize great and grave errors in certain departments, we cannot be blind
to tl1e fact of important t~ths and able discussions in others. Indeed, with all
our firm assurance as to the true 11ource of the intelligence evinced in the work,
we frequently stand amazed at the depth, order, and wideness of thought
which it displays, and at the wondrous wealth of scientific, historical, metaphy-
sical, and psychological resources in which the prompting mind seems to revel
as it expatiates from theme to theme through the circle of nearly all knowledge.
We pause to ask ourselves whether we are indeed listening to the voice of an
untutored apprentice boy, utterly ignorant of all science, yet, discoursing in
our ears the wisdom of sages! No abatement therefore on the score of theolo·
gical or even scientific errors will preventthe book's remaining an unprecedented
prodigy in the sphere of psychology, and as such claiming the profound atten-
tion of all students of th.
e phenomena of mipd. That others fail to perceive
any such qualities as we l)ave alluded to in the work, and consequently char·
acterize it as mere incoherent rhapsody and babble, strikes US' as little less won-
derful than anything contained within the lids of the volume. Without con-
senting to be deemed the endorsers of all the scientific and philosophical
theories advanced in the book, we are still satisfied for·ourselves of the general

ability it evinces, and especially of the soundness of its leading principle of the
. spiritual origin of all material things•~of the progressive development of forms
and organisms from the primitive substance-and of the propriety of the
method of reasoning from cause to effect, which is well adhered to throughout
the volume. We cannot think therefore ofgiving force to our exceptions by with·
holding just admissions. We conceive that·all wholesale and sweeping con-
demnation will be seen to re-act in favor of.the work, certain as we are that the·
deliberate verdict of the public will not susiain it. Truth i~ sometimes found
in bad company, but it is still truth, and as such sacred, and nothing is gained
by vilifying it, or by weaving the robe of reproach so wide as to enwrap
both err.or aud truth in its folds. It pleads something perhaps in favor of our
solution of the matter that we can afford to be entirely just to the claims pre-
ferred.
So far as we are conscious of our own sentiments we have endeavored to
form an impartial estimate of the volume before us. The result maybe stated
in the words of the prophet ;-" The Lord showed me, and behold, two baskets
of figs were set before the t~mple of the Lord. One basket had very good figs,
even like the figs that are first ripe: ancl the other basket had very naughty figs,
which could not be eaten, they were so bad. Then said the Lord unto me,
What seest thou, Jeremiah ? and I said, Figs ; the good figs, very good; and
the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil." The phil0$ophy (much
of it at least) and the theology are, as we conceive, in two different baskets.
Such then being, in our judgment, a no uufair character of the work, the ques-
tion at once occurs, how is the problem to be solved? Whence came the book,
and how came it to be what it i~? Tlie true solution we believe to be afforded
by Swedenborg, and.by him alone. His disclosures of the mental laws of our
being conduct us clean through the " chambers of imagery" which are opened
to our view in the effects of the Mesmeric trance. An abnormal condition is
induced by the manipulating process, and in certain temperaments, which
measurably emancipates the spirit from the bondage of the body and renders it,
for the time, more immediately accessible to spiritual influxes. These wilt
naturally be according to the dominant moral state of the subjects from whom
they emanate and of the subjects upon whom they act. Without denying that
the influences radiating unconsciously from the sphere of the operator and other
associates may be reflected by the mesmetic mind, we are still led to attribute
far more to the effect of the inflowing of disembodied spirits. These, we learn
from Swedenborg, and not less from Scripture rightly interpreted, are all from
the human race of our own or other earths in the universe, and are formed into
orders and societies according to their interior states of affection and thought
and all living and acting in close connexion with men in the flesh. Between
multitudes of these spirits and men existing on the earth the difference is little
more than that made by the poss.
ession and the non-possession of a material
body. All that constitutes character, moral and intellectual, goes with the
translated spirit into the other world, and they will infallibly act there according
• "There is nothing at all given in the natural world, which is in order, but what derives
its cause and birth from the spiritual world, that is, through the spiritual from the Divine."

to the rulingimpulses ~hich governed them here. Ifthey were Deists, Atheists,
Materialists, &c. here, they will be so there, for the Lord never does violence to
the laws of a rational and moral nature byforcing the truth upon it. Truth has
its appropriate evidence, and by that evidence it must be seen, whether in this
world or in any other. Accordingly Swedenborginforms us that he encountered
numbers in the world of spirits who yet strenuously denied the· exietence of
any such world. However strange this may seem, yet it id doubtless accordant
with the laws of our being, for if we suppose men in the present life to Jove a
lie and to confirm themselves in it, and are therefore given up to strong delusion
to believe the lie, how should the mere dissolution of the body tend to dissipate
the delusion? How then can they do otherwise than aot under its influence ?
When they speak a lie they speak of (i. e. from) their own.
We are well aware that the prevailing theology of Christendom knows little
of such a post mortem state of being as Swedenborg discloses, and consequently
it must inevitably be atfault in every attempt to dispose of such a case as that
of Davis. Its holders cannot deal with it'-there is no place for it in their
system-they are compelled therefore to deny the facts, however palpable the
evidence. Their plea is that preternatural facte require a larger amount of evi-
dence than do natural facts, and under this plea they refuse to admit any
amount of evidence however great; for if ;you stop at any given quantum of
testimony they will still say that that is not enough. ••Give us more" therefore
really means " we will be satisfied with none." ·
It is beyond question that, according to the current theology, both heaven and
hell are equally subjective states of truth, and they are both in effect about as
little in actual contact with our earth as they are with each other. Such a thing
as a vitally intimate conjunction between the spiritual and the natural spheres of
existence, however admitted in words, is practically unknown to the mass of the
Christain world.• We are thankful for clearer light on this head-a light which
comes tQ. us not on the naked authority or ipsi dizit of a gifted Seer, but a ra-
tional light, which finds confirmation in the whole philosophy of our being.
Guided by this philosophy, so liiminously unfolded by Swedenborg, we see the
minds of mesmeric subjects operated upon by the mingled influences of truth
and falsehood, emanating from corresponding sources in the spiritual world, and
one or the other predominating, according as the established life and faith of the
individual shall sway the balance; for theprecise relations betweenthe moral and
the intellectual departments of our nature is by .no one so clearly rleveloped a8
by Swedenborg. This is the point on which all novitiate readers must be pre-.
• " That there is an influx from the spiritual world into the natural world, and that the
natural world thence subsists as from it it began to exist, is at the present day utterly un-
known ; because it is not known what the spiritual is, neither do men wish to know any-
thing but what is natural, wherefore they deny anything else, especially the learned. Con-
sequently it oannot be known what spiritual influx is, and that thence is the life of thought
and will. Man was created to be a type of either world; his interiors to be a trJ>e of the
spiritual world, and his exteriors to be a type of the natural world, to the end that in him
both might be conjoined. Hence it is that his natural world, or mircocosm, does not live
except by infiux from the spiritual world, and that there is with any one a continual COfWltN
to the union ofboth worlds in him."-Sp. Diary, 4602, 4603.

pared for surprise when they come to form an acquaintance with his writings,
after having been accustomed to hear him spoken of as a mere retailer of idle
dreams ancl visions. They will find here a philosophy of which they little
dreamed. N'bw upon no point is this enlightened teacher more explicit than in
regard to the necessity of a true faith and a spiritually good life, i. e; a regenerate
life, in order to a safe or reliable converse with spirits. And we may here ob-
serve, that it is not a little remarkable that Davis himself in a communication
addressed to one of us from Poughkeepsie, and published in " Mesmer and
Swedenborg," p. 165, was prompted to quote the following passage from Swe-
denborg, together with the annexed references to the Arcana Celestia:-" Where-
fore he whose interiors are opened may discourse with them (angels and spirits)
as man with man,bttt notunless hebeof trv.efaith and be led by the (Divine) principle.''
-A. C. 784, 9438, 10, 751. The following sentences occur among the passages
here referred to :
" The reason why heaven wlls shut up involves a ~t arcanum; and also why at this
day it is so closed, that man docs not know that he is attended by spirits, much less by
angels, but supposes himself to be altogether alone when he is separate from ·worldly com- ·
pany and in meditation with himself, when nevertheless he is continually in consort with
spirits, who observe and perceive what he thinks, intende, and devi~ as clearly and openly
as if it were exposed to the view of the whole world. Man is altogether ignorant of this,
although it is a certain truth:, and thus heaven is closed in respect to him, in COfllt'qutfl« of
hil Mt being prin.eipltd ifl faith, and still ltu ifl tht tnith. offaith., af&dluut ofall i• ch.arity;
i>rwere heavenopened to him he would be exposed to the greatest danger."-A. C. 784.
Again; " It is given to no one as a spirit and angel to speak. with angels and spirits,
tltllas h.t be of tuCh. a gualitw th.at ke can comociate t11ith. th.tm iu to faith iind love; nor can
he consociate unless the mith be directed to the Lord (i. e. to Christ) and the love be directed
tp the Lord, inasmuch as man by mith in Him, thus by truths of doctrine, and by love to
Him, is conjoined, and when he is conjoined to Him, he is secure from the assaults of evil
spirits who are from hell. With others the interiors cannot be opened at all, fur they are not
in the Lord."-..&. C. 9438.
To the same purport is the following:
" The aogcls wheu they ftow in with men, flow in, as Iar as possible, into his goods, and
by ~ into truths, tlte truths, tha.t is, which h" had impressed upon himselfand of which
he had become persuaded ; that they withhold him Crom mises and guard him from evils.
When they flow iuto his goods, they flow into truths, for they are conjoined, and when into
truths, they tlow al.."O into goods. Evil spirits flow into the affections ofeviland into fulses;
in a word, into one's cupidities and appetites, as also into tlae persuasions and principles of
the false, and thus hold him captive. If a tMn ~ Mt th.t truth. of faith from th.t good• of
ch.arity, th.t angtZ. caft'&otflot.o in, becauu th.ty h.at1t "° place. But in this caee they tlow in
through spirits in!O his externals, thus holding him in an honest e.xttlrnal. This is the plane
into which heaven ftows at this day."-Sp. Diary, 4620, 4622.
"Unless a man is in tht inttrior ptr1nasioo of the thfog1 which. ptrtaiK to faith in th.t Lord,
he cannot be. in the angelic and eel«*>tial sphere, for there are repugnances, which repugnances
expel. him, nay, put him in torture. This it was given to perceive bya spiritual idea."-Sp.
Diary, 2703.
Now in the case of Davis, as his work contains enunciations directly at va-
riance not only with the teachings of Swedenborg, but with the creed of the
whole Chrliltian world on the great cardinal doctrines of the Bible, and in the

12 DAVI& REVELATIONS
character and claims of the Bible itself as a divine revelation, we have no al-
ternative but the conviction,that seeing such enunciations are manifest falsities,
he is not in true fa?th, and cont1equently has not enjoyed a true communication
with the spiritual spheres, as far as these points are concerned. He has doubt-
less been gifted with a species of internal sight-he has been brought into a con-
dition which has opened his mind to the reception of various natural, scientific,
and philosophical truths.; but in all this he hae not been elevated. above the
intellectual plane, and this has left him exposed to the inroads of the most griev-
ous delusions in regard to moral themes, to the economy of redemption, and the
whole circle of its cognate verities. This is precisely in accoroance with what
Swedenborg assures us of the distinction between the opening of the spiritwl

• " When a man is born, he first· comes into the natural degree, and this increases
in him by continuity, according to his knowledge and the understanding he acquires
by it to the highest point of understanding called rationality. Nevertheless the second or
spiritual degree is not hereby opened. This degree is opened by the love of uses, derived
from intellectual things, that is, by the spiritual love of uses, which is love towards the
neighbor. This degree likewi!ie may increase by degrees of continuity to its summit, and it
increases by the knowledges ofgood and truth, or byspiritual truth. Nevertheless the third or
celestial degree is not opened by these, but by the celestial love of use, which is love towards
the Lord; and love towards the Lord is nothing else than committing to life the command·
ments ofthe Word; ofwhich the sum is, to flee from evils because they are infernal and
diabolical, and to do goods because they are heavenly and divine. These three de-
grees are thus successively opened in a man." "Since these degrees are successively opened,
4 according to a man's life, it follows that the two superior degrees may not be opened, and
that man then continues in the natttral or ultimate degree." " The natural man is a full
man when his spiritual degree is opened ; he is then in association at once with angels in
heaven, and with men in the world, and in his relation to both lives under the guidance of
the Lord; for the spiritual man imbibes precepts through the Word frOilll the Lord, and exe-
cutes them by the natural man.-D. L. f' W. 237, 248, 252.

t.han ever before. When they peroeived that I was reflecting upon their influx they became
highly indignant and wished; as they said, to withdraw, but they knew not whither. The
things that flowed from them were contrary to the Lord and contrary to whatever is of fuith.
They were exceedingly complaisant to every cupidity that was given, and when they could
hold men in any evilcupidity, they were then in theirlife.and delight, as was also said to them.
In such cases they suppose themselves to live as the man, for they then appropriate his life fS
their own, because in a similar life, consequently in society with the man. But where there
is a repugnance, as with one who does not suffer himself to be perverted by them, but re·
mains in fuith, with him they cannot live, for he is not in the stream of their life."-Sp.

From this it appears to be so much more than possible, ihat it is very easy
for one to come, when least suspecting it, under a delusive influence from this
source, that shall prompt the most egregious falsitiea which neither the subject
himself nor his favoring auditors may be able to detect owing.to their accordance
with that moral state which exercises so marked a control over his views of
truth. That young Davis has unwittingly fallen under the action of these sub-
tle prompters, is, we fear, but too -transparently evident from the tenor of
his givings-ont on a variety of snbjeeta.
But we here anticipate a query which is by no means unnatural in view of
what has just been said. If all this be so, why may not Swedenborg himself
have been equally liable to delusion and thus his reports from the other world
be entitled to little credit? We would say in reply, that one's being enabled at
all to disclose such fallacies affords a strong presumption of his being armed
against them, for why should he otherwise have been thus empowered ? But
this is not all. We hav~ his own explicit statement on this head in the {pllow-
ini language:-

yea, sometimes they were indignant, when they peTCeived that I was reflecting. Thus have
I been instructed ; consequently by no spirit, nor by any angel, but by the Lord alone, from
Whom is all truth and good : yea, when they wished to ilJ!!trUct me concerning various thingll,
there was scarcely anything but what WM fu.lse: wherefure I was prohibited from believing
anything that they spake ; nor was I permitted to infer any such thing as was proper to

pe~ion that the thing w1lli such, and not as they wished ; which also they wondered at :
the perception was manifest, but camot be easily described to the apprebensioo of men."-

In a letter to the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, after speaking of the favor
which the Lord had granted to himself in opening the eyes of his spirit, and
thus introducing him into the spiritual world, be says~

So also in the work on Divine Providence when treating or the inherent in-
efficacy of miracles, signs, visions, conversing with the dead, &c. to work a
saving reformation in men, he says ;-
" Yet speak.itlg with spirits, but rarely with angels of heaven,,is still given, and bas been .
given for many age8 back; but when it is given they speak with man in his mother-tongue,
yet only a few words: but they who speak from permis~ion of the Lord, never speak any
thing which takes aWf!>Y freedom of reason, nor teach; for the Lord alone teaches man, but
mediately throuah the Word in illustra_tion. That it is so.it bas been given me to know
from my own experience ; I have had speech wjth spirits and angels now for many years,
neither has any spirit dared, nor any angel wished, to tell me anything, still less to instruct
me concernixig any things in the Word, or concerning any doctrinal frcim the Word ; but the
Lord alone has taught me."-D. P. 135.
Every one will judge of course for himself of the trustworthiness of one who
speaks thus the language ·of calm assµ.rance. and apparent truth. . For ourselves
we are very far from doubting it, aud we think too that the gratitude of all sober
and devout minds iii largely drawn apon by such an exposure as he has made
of the fallacies, phantasies,. and delusions originating in the world of spirits.
·These inftuus are so amazingly subtl8-\they come oftentimes in a guise so ex-
quisitely specious-they form themselves into propositions so apparently ra-
tional and logical~their persu&.11ive power is so well nigh irresistible-that but

titudes of unsuspecting minds would be at th.is- day in d!lnger of being duped
.into the belief of the most infernal falsities, 11imply from the force of the current
idea, that what.is1 in the ordinary sense of the term, supernatural, must of ne-
cessity be true. Thanks to the grace of the Lord's providence that we are not
left to be led at the mercy of these seducing spirits !-that we are abundantly
warped of the peril of committing ourselves to the guidance of these fatuous
lights! Availing ourselves of the benefit of Swedenborg's illumination, we may
adopt a prophylactic policy which shall guard us against the pernicious illusions
to which our moral obliquities render us liable, and which we can scarcely sup-
pose would have been allowed at this day to break forth, like an armed man,
from the spiritual sphere, had not the appropriate safeguards been afforded prior
to their invasion. ·
The errors of the present volume which menace the most mischief to the
unwary reader are those which are conveyed in its theological teachings. The
evident drift of the work is to elevate and enthrone Natural above Revealed
Religion. Taking advantage of philosophical. principles,which are in the main
sound, it goes to erect upon them a system of pure unmitigated Theism, which
utterly ignores any other Divine Revelation than that which is made in the vol-
ume of Nature. The idea of an inspired Book embodying the counsels of the
Divine Will and Wisdom, .and serving as a medium of conjunction between
heaven and earth, it not only does not admit, but openly scouts and ridicules,
and occasionally in language strangely at variance With its predominant tone,
which is ealm and dignified. But although the argument on this head is for the
most part specious, and considerations are occasionally urged which involve
real difficulties onthe ground ordinarily assumed in regard to the biblicalwritings,

making the minds ofthe sacred penmen the original prompting and producing
causes of the thonghts of which their language is the vehicle. One would think
that the analogy of his own case would have suggested the possibility of a
spiritual influx from the fountain-head of Truth, altogether over and above
anything that might have entered into their own perso!lal and conscious in·
tention, which is doubtless the true idea of inspiration.• Now in regard to the
nature of that influence under which the Bible was written, Davis recognizes
merely the prompting of the spirits of the writers, and colilleqnently on the seore
of interpretation, he denies to Swedenborg the credit of having developed an
interior spiritual sense which natively pertains ·to tl).e sacred text, and simply as·
cribes to him a new application of the letter of the record. "His·writings do
not unfold a germ of spiritual truth in those primitive pages, because it is im-
possible for them to contain such1 inasmuch as they are only historical accounts,
and not spiritual revelations. So he does not unfoW an interior meaning from
these writings; but develops a novel exterior application and signification, which
robs the Old and New Testaments of their present garb, and clothes them in a
garment of spiritual beautyof which theyare unworthy." We shall by and byex·
pose the author's inconsistency on.this subject, but we would here advertsimply
to the fundamental principle affirmed, which is/that as the books of the Bible
are the product of the minds of the writers, whose thoughts were the cau.ru of
their expressions, and as these causes did not involve any Divine element, there-
fore no such element exists in their writings. Thie·is repeatedly intimated in
different parts of the volume, but nowhere perhaps more· explicitly .than in the.
following passages;-" In speaking of superstiJ;ions and false interpretations,·I
refer to the fact that it is"taught with a great deal of sanctimoniousness, that its
contents are an influx from the Divine ·Mind into the minds of those who wrote
it. I am distinctly impressed with the conviction that no book, or any other
superficial production of man, can legitimately and truthfully claim such inspi·
ration. For nothing can be of divine origin which is not inseparably connected

in the thought, and the thoug!lt was led to the understanding of these words, and the idea

'revelation was sensibly made; Concerning other species of revelations, which arenumerous,

in such a way that if an attempt were made to write otherwise it would be impos8ible; and
this not only with an adjoined perception ofthe subject, buteven-what bas again and again
happened to me-without this perception, so that I was ignorant of the series of things till
after they were written ; but this in very rare instances, and only for the sake of informing us
that revelations are made in this manner. Those papers therefore were destroyed, as God
Messiah did not design that the revelation (through me) should be thus made. Neither is it
permitted to dictate.anything tritta '1oce, although a '1itia tioce discourse (with spirits) has
beel2 enjoyed by me almost continually for sci long a time; but whenever I wrote they were
silent. Concerning these things, God Messiah permitting, I shall speak more fully in another
place, that men may know how tile case was in regard to revelations in the primitive church,
afterwards in the representative,.and finally in the symbolical church, that they may thence
acknowledge that there is not even a jot in the books of Moses, ofthe prophets, and ofDavid,
which is not inspired, and that theee cele8tial things are invariably oontained 111:iderthe fonns

with, and incessantly developed by, the laws, qualities, and principles, contain-

man creates or invents merely by his evanescent. imagin'ltion, can not be any

"Giving to any book or its contents a' spiritual signification,' is not to unfold
an interior origin or cause of the ideas expressed ; but it is merely setting aside
its literal signification, and clothing its teachings with a spiritual garment. This
is manifestly covering or concealing expressions, which are sometimes loose,
unguarded, and even unrighteous and insignificant, with a brilliant external and
ornamental garl\lent. But it is distinctly clear that in order to search into the
interior or germ of a thought, the mind must become acquainted with the causes
engaged in developing that germ into the form of a written expression. And it
is absolutely impossible to give a real signification to expressions the soul or
cause of which originated merely in the theology and mythology of an age when
misdirection and unreasonable hallucination had possession, to a great extent,
of the mind of every human being."-p. 540. ·
" I am particularly desirous of being apprehended aright in speaking of this
important distinction between the interior signification of a tenn or expression,
and that spirituaz application which has been called an interior meaning. In
order to be distinctly understood, I again repeat that no mind can search into
and analyze the interior meaning or origin of words and expressions, without
arriving irr~sistibly at the conclusion which has been heretofore attained-that
the contents of the Bible, like those of all other books, have originated among a
number of productive causes, all of which must be taken into consideration be-
fore any validity or importance can be attached to the records therein contained."
-p. 541.
"These considerations show that it is impossible to give an interior significa-
tion of a spiritual character to that which does not already contain a Divine and
celestial element."-p. 541.
Now Swedenborg teaches that although the words of the sacred writers were
in a sense, their own, and expressive of certain ideas in their minds, yet that
there was an influx or infusion of the Divine principle into their language giving
it a meaning beyond their personal intention, and that in this their real sanctity
and divinity consists. In other terms, their words are receptive vessel• into which
the divine ide~ flowed, which thus constitute an essential element of the Word,
and make it a truly inspired composition. " Inspiration implies that in all parts
of the Word, even the most minute, as well historical as others, are contained
celestial things which are of love, or good, and spiritual things which are of
faith, or truth; consequently, things divine. For what is inspired by the Lord
descends from Him through the angelic heaven, and thus through the world of
spirits, till it reaches man, before whom it presents itself such as it is in the let-
ter."-A. C. 1887. · "The literal sense of the Word is representative of divine
arcana, and i~ a receptacle and thus a repository of the celestial and spiritual
things ofthe Lord."-A. C. 1888. This truth our" Seer's" faculty did not enable
him to discern, although it is in fact in full accordance with the better part of
•his own philosophy, which recognizes the principle of correspondence between
spiritual and natural things-essentially relative between cause and effect-and

on which principle the sacred Word is constructed. Thus, for instance, as the
affection of meekness is the spiritual cause of the existence of a d01Je, the tenn
d01Je necessarily conveys to a spiritual mind the idea of mtekness, and this is its
interior sense; and such a sense Swedenborg infonns us runs through the entire
Word, a sense based upon a uniform law, and a sense. which it was his grand
mission to develope. As Davis himself knew nothing at the time on this subject
one way or the other, what deplorable fatuity or consummate effrontery must have
moved his prompting spirits to deny so palpable a point as Swedenborg's dis-
closure of the fact and the law of a spiritual signification inhering in the letter of
the Word ! But we are expressly assured that the same denial of the interio1
sense of the Word obtains among the spiritual sophists of the other world. From
the internal repuguancy growing out of the state of their affections towards
Divine things, they often persist in the stubborn rejection of that latent spiritual
import which constitues in fact the very soul of Revelation. We see this strilt-
ingly illustrated in the following passages :
" There are spirits who are in other respects good. but who cannot as yet be admitted into
heaven, because they are not willing to hear and to admit the interior, and still less the more
interior, things of the Word ; and who, on this account, thought evil llgllinst me and inter-
preted what I said in an evil sense. For those who do not approve internal things, cannot
learn those things which belong to the interior and internal man ; for they are ignorant that
there are interior things, still less do they know that things more interior exist ; hence, in re-
spect to works oi faith,, they call those good which are done by good men, in obedience to
the Word, and from a good heart. But when they are told that good works must be works
ofcharity, and that charity is of mercy, and thus from the Lord the Saviour, they admit that
it is so, but they do not think so profoundly as to see that it is so. Such spirits, therefore,
as cannot as yet admit interior truths, cannot as yet be introduced by the way of knowledge
[even] into the exterior heaven.
" Moreover, such as will not at all hear or admitof interior things, remain out of heaven, nor
can they do otherwise than hate such things, because they are more or less interior, and also
those who teach them. As upon earth there will, as I think, be many who will hate the
interior and mare inward things of the Word, because they more closely touch the life of
their love, in favor of which they object to certain difficulties which appear to them as im-
possible to be explained ; thus they ra,ther prefer that the way to interior things should be
closed against them, than that they should fuvor them by their assent; besides this, they are
not willing to be disquieted by such things as they assert they are not capable ofunderstand-
ing.
" Such spirits have very often conversed with me, and have frequently reproached me for
teaching interior things, because such things appeared as paradoxical to them ; and al~
some this day who were of a similar ~haracter, and who.on that accoun"'t thought ill of the
acts of my life. In a word, at the present time the heaven ofspirits is ahnost filled with
such; but it is otherwise with all such as are in heaven."-Sp. Diary, 1139-1141.
What then can be fairly inferred but that the young man bas been obsessed
by precisely this class of spirits, and under their instigations has given forth this
pernicious heresy to the world ? It is obviously impossible that such sentiments
could have come from heaven, and yet the proof we deem equally conclusive
that they have not, in this case, come from earth. How inevitable then the in-
ference, that communications may emanate from the spiritual world, and yet be
replete with the most diabolical falsities. And what a commentary do we read

in this on the truth of Swedenborg's discfoaures of the other life. Indeed, we
are fully persuaded that this is infact the true provi.dential mission of the book. In
itself and its sequences it is expressly designed to be overruled to the further-
ance of that very system of revelations against which, on several points, it sets
itself iu hostile array. While its friends and favorers are dreaining of entirely
another issue, and look upon it as a fresh apoc;ialypse of celestial verities, which
are destined to demolish the old crazy citadel of biblical Christianity, the result
will doubtless be that the weapon will be quietly taken out of their hands, and
the whole demonstration made to tell in the establishment of the grand truths of
the New Jerusalem. Reflecting minds cannot be insensible to the ground occu-
pied by a system which takes the most perfect cognizance of the phenomenon
exhibited in the present work, treating it as a matter .of course from its own
stand.point, and pressing even its most ·egregious falsities into the service imd
confirmation of paramount truths. Thus the arch-deceiver will be found to have
outwitted himself in aiming to ply this master-piece of infernal cunning against
the immovable fabric qf Revelation., We say "cunning," which applies to it
for the most part, though it must be confessed that we not unfrequently discern
a shallowness in the devices ofthe book which savors butlittle of the proverbial
craft of their origin, while at the same time their singular boldnt88 precludes the
supposition of human imposture. What man in his right senses wonld ever
think that such crudities could be digested by the gastric potencies of the. stom-
ach of any christian community as the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures from
Persian manuscript during the captivity in Babylon-the divination of the my-
tlws of the biblical Trinity from the Hindoo legends respecting Parama, Vishnu,
and Siva-the passing over of the idea of hell from its birth place in central .
America, to the Jewish :nation in Asia, :and, though last not least, the grave
acccount of 318 bishops assembled under Constantine at the Council of Nice
deciding upon the Canon of Scripture, when church history does not whisper a
syllable of any such action on the part of that body. It would seem as if the
poet's hint of occasional Homeric dimnitations were so far applicable in the pres-
ent case as to allow of a change of the epithet into Satanic. To receive such
"revelations" as true would at any rate, imply, not a mere drOflJsy nodding, but a
profound .Zumber, on the part of the reader. But to return.
The theology of the Bible, Davis perpetually confounds with mythology, of
which he regards it as a form, and by thus investing it with the air of fable, he
paves the way for the µniversal desecration of w4atever is most holy and
reverend in the estimation of all pious minds. The sentiments with which the
sacred books have always been cherished by Christians he invariably treats as
" affections for erroneous principles created only by early impressions," and
seems to be wholly unaware that his reiterated demand for appeal to the de-
cisions of" reason," of "judgment," of the "spiritual sensibilities," has been
fully responded to by thousands of enlightened minds, in every age, who have
attained to a full assurance of the divinity of these lively oracles, by applying
to them the same principles of evidence on which we are required to receive
the dicta of this book in opposition to them.

ful reflex of the speculations of spirits in the other world, yet the following ex.
tract from Swedenborg's Spiritual Diary will show how accurately the utter-
ance on the stage corresponds with the prompting behind the scenes. The
article is headed ;-Concerning revealed Theology, or the Word, and natural Theol·
ogy.
"For seyeral days a.D earnestdispute was kept up between certain spiri~ who believed in
the Word, and that it was all from the Divine, and Divine in itself, and certain others who,
in the lllil of the body, had believed that natural Theology wu to be preferred, and that this
shed light upon that, and not 1'ice 1'eraa. The dispute was such as to enkindle enmity, but
only on the part of those who argued for natural theology, and not of those who contended
for the Word; the former croclly infested the latter for some days, and breathed nothing Jess
than their destruction both in body and soul. They even admitted the infemals into them·
selves, who acted from their own promptings, and while these infernals spake through them,
they not only denied that the Word or revelation was anything, but they despised it for its
simple and uncouth style, as they teml6d it, and utterly rejected it in their hearts. It was
then said to them that the style was such from its containing within itself the deepest
arcana which are lai open in order in their heavens, and because the Divine wi!!dom in·
heres in it, from whence is celeatial and spiritual nourishment; for the heavens are conjoined
with men, especially thoee of the church, and the) dwell in their good a.B"ections, thus mak·
Ing one with the men of the church through the Word. Still they could not receive this;
they under ood indeed that it was l!O, and they also know it in the other life; but because
they were such as they were, in the life of the body, it did not remain with them, but the
infemals continued to act through them, and therefore they burnt to deeuoy those who had
mith in the Word. Thence it was manifest how the case is with tbose who believe that it
may be known from nature.thaf there is a Divine being, of what quality he is, that there is
a heaven and a hell, and a life after death-viz. that they believe ab!'<>lutely nothing of all
this, the rea~on of which is, that they are in the lumen of nature, and not in the light of
heaven, thus with infilmals, and not with celestiale."-Sp. Diary, 4757.
We are well aware that the world is not indebteP, to Swedenborg a.lone for
sormd views on the inadequacy of NatlUal Religion to meet the demands of
man's moral nature, but the train of reflection on this head embodied. in the
following paragraph, will be seen to be of great importance in connexion with
this mass of anti-revelation" revealments."
"It is believed in the world, that man from the lmnen of nature, thus withont revelation,
1:an know several things which relate to religion, as tbat there is a Cod, that He is to be
worshipped, and also that He is to be. loved, likewise that man is to live after death, with
several truths besides which deper on these ; and yet they are Sl!Ch as are derived from
self-inteltigenee: but I have been instructed from rnueh eiq>erience, that man himselfknows
nothing at all coruiemiug Divine things, and concerning thoee things which relate to celestial
and spiritual liil, without revelation ; fur man is bom into tlle "!ls of the Jove of selfand of
the world, which are such as preelude iillllll from the beavene, and open illilm: from the
hell!; thus sueh as -ke man blind, and ineline him to deny die wstenee of the Divine, of
heaven and hell, and of the Bk after death. This is Tery maniht from the learned ones of
the world, who by sciences have raised the lumen of their mature a'bove others, for it iif
known that these deny the Divine1 and acknowledge nature instead of the Diville, more than

nature without revelation. It has also been shown, that several who have written natural
theology, and from the lumen of their own nature have dexterously confirmed those things
which related to the doctrine of their own church, in the other iife deny those things in
heart more than others do, and also deny the Word itself, which they attempt altogether to
destroy, for in the other life hearts speak; it hath been also shown, that the f'llllle can re-
ceive nothing of influx out of heaven, but only from the hells: hence it has appeared evi·
dent what is the quality ofthe lumen of nature without revelation, consequently what is the
quality of that which comes from self-intelligence. But two considerations have occurred,
which place the mind in doubt on this subject ; first, that the ancients, who were Gentiles,
still knew that there is a Divine, that It is to be worshipped, and. that man as to the soul is
immortal; 8flOndly, that these things are known also to several nations at this day, with
whom there is no revelation. But as to what concerns the ancients it is to be observed, that
they did not know those things from the lumen of .their own nature, but from revel.11.tion,
which flowed down even to them from the chureh; for the church of the Lord from the most
ancient times had been in the land of Canaan; hence such things appertaining to Divine
worship were diffused from th11m to the nations round about, and. likewiseto the neighboring
Greeks, and from these to the Italians or Romans; hence both the latter and the former had
knowledges respecting the Supreme Deity, and concerning the i=ortality of the soul, on
which subjeCts their learned men have written. As to what concerns the nations at this day,
who are also acquainted with the existence of the Divine; and of a life after death, they have
not derived this knowledge from the lumen of their own nature, but from the religious [doc·
trine] haaded down to them from ancient times, whWh was founded on such [knowledge],
as by various ways had flowed down from the church which had revelation ; this was of
the Divine Providence of the Lord ; and that such of them as from their religious persuasions
acknowledge the Divine over all things, and perform offices ofcharity to their neighbor, in
the other life, when they are instructed, receive the"truths of faith and are saved."-.<f. O.

Nothing can be more evident than that a state of mind, however induced,
which thus exalts the claims of natural above those of revealed religion, will
infallibly prompt to j11St that slighting ·and contemptuous esteem of the Bible,
as a Divine revelation, which manifests itself throughout this tissue of pseudo-
theology, and the counterpart of this again we find in Swedenborg's disclosures
of the.discnssions 0£.the spiritual world.
"A certain society was heard where they were conversing among themselves, and saying
that their discourse was concerning the Word. It was maintained that there was nothing
Divine in it, and they aho opened the Books of the Bible and wherever they read therein
they found nothing else, as they said, th!Ul what was merely terrestrial, and noWhere any
thing trui:t was Divine; wherefore they took up the idea that the Word was not divine, but
that it was merely accepted .and held as hqly. But a certain one of them, whom I heard
speaking, answered that it was necessary that there should be a Divine principle inherent in
the Word, and that there was something inwardly latent in the sense which is not known,
and he addueed several things from the prophetical writings showing that this recondite in·
terior meaning did not appear before man; the ground of all which (he said) was, that it
was indispensable that there should be some Divine Word on the earth, because man was
born that he mightcome into anothe.
r life. He said afterwards thatmany of the interior things
ofthe Wordwere opened to him, but that the restcould perceive nothing ofthem."-.sp. Diary,

the spiritual wodd. It is now submitted to the reader whether the solutions

proffered do not adequately meet the exigencies of the present case. If what
is termed the Mes~ric state be a reality-if the spiritual world be a reality- •
do we not find the two here presented in such relation to each other as to ac-
count satisfactorily for the extraordinary features of the work before us 1 The
phenomena ofthe case must be explained in someway. Itis certainthathereis
a book which, with all its errors, discovers an amount of knowledge, a reach of
thought, and sometimes a force of reasoning, which is confessedly of a high
order. It is certain that this book came from or through the mind of a young
man, concerning whom it is clearly in evidence, that, considered in himself, in
his previous attainments, and in his general mental habits, he Wat utterly in-
competent to its production. Yet here it i&-a fixed fact incapable of denial.
The work has come into existence somehow, and with it an enigma which
demands to be solved. From all that has been disclosed of the effects of the
Mesmeric trance it appears beyond question that persons in that state fre-
quently evince a degree of intelligence incomparably beyond that of their ordi-
nary state, and as no experiments or indications have as yet set limits to this
intelligence, it cannot be said to be absolutely incredible that the state should
have given birth to the work before us. It differs rather in degree than in
kind from various other manifestations of the same power which have ap-
proved themselves as real to a very large class.of observers. Assuming, on
the other hand, the truth of Swedenborg's representations of the other world
merely as a hypothesis, the facts developed in this case are certainly such as
we should be authorized to anticipate provided what he says were true. As
the minds of men are continually in contact with the minds of spirits, and as
these spirits are distinguished by the same diversities of moral character with
tho.se upon whom they act in this world, what more natural than that a two-
fold influx of truth and falsehood should emanate from their sphere, and show
itself visible in the utterances put forth by xµesmeric subjects 1 And what
more natural again than that the predominance of the one or the other should
depend upon the interior moral state of the recipient1 Every man, we are
informed, is actually though unconsciously associated with spirits who are
in the same ruling love with himself, which is in all cases the infalli-
ble touch-stone of his moral state in the sight of God. It is not however to be
inferred that one who is dominantly in evil receives none but evil influences,
any more than that he who is dominantly in good receives none but good in·
fluences. As man's states in this world are mostly mixed states, so they are
liable to mixed influences from the world of spirits. But as the ruling love,
or the will principle, always moulds the form of intellectual belief, and as this
principle is as truly operative.in the mesmeric state as in any other, it will
naturally follow that those persuasions will hold the ascendency which are
most in accordance with the love that determines the morai state. "Inas-
much," says Swedenborg," as good and truth are a one in the Lord, and pro-
ceed as a one from him, it follows, that good loves truth, and- truth loves
good, and that they desire to be a one. . The like is true of their opposites: evil
loves the false, and the false loves evil, and they are desirous of being a
one."-" Good relates to the will, truth to the understanding. From the
love of good in the will, proceeds the love of truth in the underetanding!J,

from the love of truth proceeds the perception of truth ; from the perception .
of truth the thought of truth ; and from these comes the acknowledgment
of truth, which is faith in its genuine sense."-D. L. 33, 36.
In the present instance it is perfect!¥ palpable that Davis, under some kind
of spiritual prompting, denies without reserve the grand central truths which
have always been held by the mass of Christians as inseparably connected
with the good which forms the ground-element of their character. Instead of
regarding Christ as Divine in the highest and truest sense, that is, as Jehovah
incarnate, he speaks of him simply as a "great Moral Reformer," purely hu-
man, the son of Joseph and Mary by natural generation, and kno.ws nothing of
him in his asserted character of Redeemer and Saviour ofa fallen race. Now
apply to this the test of the apostle ;-" Every spirit that confesseth not that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God." The work before us has no
other confession on this head than that Christ has come in the flesh just as
Plato, and sOcrates, and Confucius came in the flesh, which is a manifest con-
tradiction of the true purport of the apostolic testimony. We allude·to this
not for the purpose of arguing the question, but to sustain our inference of de-
lusion as respects the influxes under which he has uttered his "revelations."
That there are those in the nominal Christian world who upon this, as well
as several other of the doctrinal positions of the book, would side with the
"revelator,'' rather than with us his impugners, cannot operate to lower the
tone of assurance with which we denominate the t~achings false and prompted
by spirits offalsity. The estimate formed of the character and office of Jesus
we.are constrained to regard as in general a just exponent of a moral posture
of the soul, to which they have a direct and all-important reference. The
interWr state, lying behind or below all speculative opinions on the subject, and
by which the judgment of the inte\lect respecting lt will be governed, we con-
sider as forming the most momentous of all distinctions among men. Upon
the veritable character of this state in any given case we are not allowed to
pronounce judgment, but we may be permitted to say that for ourselves the
convictions we entertain on this point are to our wh9le system of religious
faith what the heart is to the human body, and as we feel and believe, we
speak. The foundations of a religious creed lie, in our view, much deeper
than we are conducted by the bare interpretation of a ·text, and we deem it
neither weakness nor narrowness to confess that we have a secret dread of
being warped by our affections into anything less than the acknowledgment
of God incarnate as the basis of our hope of heaven. If there is a ground
for a holy jealousy on the score in our own case, it is not perhaps uncharita-
ble to suppose it may be so with others. At any rate, we see clearly that all
the other theological errors of the work in question are mere off-shoots from
this parent stock of heresy in the bold denial of anything more than a simple
humanity in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Our conclusion therefore is that Davis has been grievously deludea by the
arts and machinations of deceitful spirits and that occasion for this has been
given by the lack of a true faith, the product of a moral state rightly affected
towards all divine things. He has thus been prevented from associating with
a sphere of pure truth and been made the subject of the most enormously

24 DAVIS' REVELATIONS
false impressions in regard to the whole circle of religious doctrines. We are
shut up to this conviction by the very nature of his utterances. No man who
is in the truth of faith can, by any possibility, so falsify and vilify the sublime
doctrines of the Word as is done in the work under consideration, and no de-
gree of native amiableness, gentleness, or benevolence can preclude the assur-
ance of some radical defect in the moral habitudes of the soul from which
such monstrosities of dogma flow forth. The supposition is doubtless entirely
groundless that the young man is, in his abnormal state, freed from the influ-
ence of moral, affinities which bring him into fellowship with spirits of a kindred
stamp, which is in fact the great law of association in the other world. Con-
sequently we cannot but recognize a very great error in the following passage
of the Introduction to these Lectures, where the reporter is speaking of the
peculiarities of the state into which the m~smeric subject is broughf. "His
mind is now entirely freed from the sphere of the body, and, consequently,
from all preconceived ideas, from all theological isms, and from all influences
of education and local circumstances, and all his impressions are received from
the interior or spiritual world..... He is thus elevated above all the narrow,
local, and sectarian prejudices that pervade the earth. His philosophy is only
that which is involved in the laws and principles which control the Universe
and viankind unerringly, and his theology is only that which is written on
the wide-spread scroll of the heavens, in which every star is a word and every
constellation a sentence." Bating the rhetoric, this is a virtual assumption of
absolute infallibility. But to say nothing of the fact that such a mental state,
if it could exist, would destroy a man's identity, it is a mere creation of the
brain. It is impossible that any state should so completely divest a man of
his proprium or self-hood. The oxydized adherences of an iron conduit will
not more surely tinge the water that flows through it than will the internal
moral qualities of the man affect the spiritual influxes of which he is the sub-
ject. We are aware that Mr. Davis considers himself as having been freed
from every theological bias, even in his ordinary state, during the delivery of
the Lectures, and that he scarcely felt himself at liberty to form a single opi-
nion on religious doctrines lest it might interfere with that blank indifferentism
which he deemed so essential to the purity and truth of his revelati~ns. This
was clearly wrong, and the very suggestion of such a surrender of liberty and
rationality ought to have been regarded as the breathing of the serpent, for all
such methpds of receiving instruction in matters of faith are contrary to order
and never to be justified by any imagined use that is to result to one's self or
the world from such teachings. "Because the Lord wills," says Swedenborg,
" that man should be reformed and regenerated, that he may have eternal life
or the life of heaven, and no one can be reformed or regenerated unless good
is appropriated to his will and truth to his understanding, and because no-
thing can be appropriated to any one, except what is made of the understanding
from freedom of will according to reason, it follows that no one is reformed in
states of non-liberty and non-rationality." Nor may we suppose for a moment
that any one is ever prompted by the Divine spirit to engage in any kind of
ministry for the benefit of others of such a nature as to be inconsistent with
the orderly furtherance of his own regeneration.

We would not'Of course be understood by this as passing a sentence of con-
demnation upon every form of the mesmeric operations, or intimate a moral
wrong in every instance in which one submits himself to the influence of that
mysterious power. It is only in cases when it is resorted to as a medium for
obtaining the knowledge of religious truths, that our strictures apply. It is
when one resigns his moral freedom of belief and puts his waking rationality
in abeyance in order to become a vehicle of sleeping oracles, that the order
of heaven is departed from, and the door opened to the ingress of the most
deplorable delusions.
In the work on "Pn.eumatology," by the celebrated Jung-Stilling of Germany,
occurs the following passage which finds the most pertinent illustration, as
we conceive, in the work before Ul!.
"Experience teaches that persons far advanced in piety may fall into this state of natural
magnetic sleep, and aISo enter into connection with good spirits, and even angels. Vain and
false spirits frequently interfere on these occasions, and seek to deceive and mislead the seer.
These study his inclinations and wishes, and then arrange the communications, imagery
and ideas, in such a manner as to gratify' his favorite inclinations. Now if he regards all
this as a divine revelation, he will be satisfied that his wishes are agreeable to God, and thus
he may fall into the most dangerous errors. The tnith and importance of this obeervation
cannot be too premngly urged ; for if a man or even a child, fall into a trance, or into any
other state of supernatural elevation, and then begin to preach repentance, predict future
things, and speak in a ·style to which he is naturally incompetent, the common spectator,
especially if be is religiously inclined, regards it all as divine infiuence and revelation; and
the poor somnambulist himself believes it also, rejoices at it, is deeply e.ffected by it, thanks
God fur it, and now the thought secretly arises in his mind, that he is something particular,
and that God has some great object in view with him ; he comes into connection with false
spirits of light, who strengthen him in such ideas by a variety of delusive imagery, and •
then the arch-enthusiast is completed."-Theory of Pnewnatology, p. 69.
Still more amply is this idea confirmed by Swedenborg in the important ex-
tract that follows from the Apocalypse Explained.
"Something shall now be said concerning the diScourse of spirits with man. It is be-
lieved by many that man may be taught ofthe Lord by spirits speaking with him; but they
who believe thil, afld are "1illing to beline it, do not know that it ii cOflflected with danger to
their 1ouli. · As soon as spirits begin to speak with man, they come out of their spiritual
state into the natural state of man, and in this case they know that they are with man, and
conjoin themsel"!63 with the thoughts of his affection, and from those thoughts speak
with him: they cannot enter into anything else, for similar affection and consequent
thought conjoins JIJI, and dissimilar separates. It is owing to this circumstance, that the
speaking spirit ii i• the 1ame principk1 with the man to whom he apeak1 whether they
be true or jalu, and likewise that he excites them, and by his affection c~njoined to the
man's aftection strongly confirms them: hence it is evident that none other than similar
spirits speak with man, or manifestly opt>mte upon him, for manifest operation coincides
with speech. Hence it is that no other than enthusiastic spirits speak with enthusiasts:
also, tliat no other than Quaker spirits operate upon Quakers, and Moravian spirits upon
Momvians; the case would be similar with Arians, with Socinians, and with other
heretics. All spirits speaking with man are no other than such as have been men in the
world, and were then of such a quality ; that this is the case hath been given me to know
by repeated experience. From these considerations it is evident to tohat dat1ger lll4tl ii u;.

Expl. 1182.
It is a truth, therefore, which cannot be too deeply impressed on the minds
of all, that a communication is not mcessarily true, beeauu it is made in a super-
natural or preternatural manner. Inasmuch as there are both good and evil
spirits in the other world-a heaven of angels and a hell of devils-and inas-
much as both these classes of spirits have access to human minds, and either
of them may exercise a controlling influence, and infuse their own tlioughts,
according as the mind on which they wish to operate is directed towards the
Lord and imbued with a true faith, or otherwise, therefore there. may befalse
as well as true communications made to a man in a transic or abnormal state ;
and there may also, as in the case before us, be communications contai:qing
a mixture of truth and error. They may be from above, or from beneath, or
from both these sources. It is, however, to be remarked, that evil spirits may
for the sake of more effectually accomplishing their malignant purposes, often
communicate much truth. Swedenborg declares that evil spirits can at times
not only "assume the appearance of angels of light" (A. R. 839), but "are able
to discourse [upon some subjects) so wisely, that an angel could scarce dis-
course more wisely."-Ath. Creed, 65.
• We are fully aware that the current opinion among christians at the present
time is contrary to what is here stated. The prevailing belief appears to be,
that whatever is communicated to men in any extraordinary or preternatural
manner, as is claimed for, and conceded to, the Lectures before us, must there-
fore be from heaven, and of mcessity true. The safety of c1tristians at the pres-
ent day lies, as we conceive, in rejecting this idea as alike false and dangerous,
and in adopting the more rational and scriptural doctrine on this subject pre-
sented by Swedenborg. The more Scriptural doctrine, we say: for do not the
Scriptures declare that evil spirits have power to do wonderful things 1 Do
we not read of the " spirits of devils, 'llJOTking miracles 7" (Rev. xvi. 14.) And
does not Paul speak of one to be revealed, " whose coming is after the work-
ing of Satan, with all power and signs, and lying tlXmders 1" (2 Thes. ii. 9.)
And does not the Scripture authorize and require us to reject the communica-
tions of one who may give ample evidence even of a prophetic gift-who may
tell us things that shall really come to pass-if his teachings do not square
with "the law and the testimony," and would lead us away from tlte living
and eternal Word 1 " If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of
dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder tome·to
pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, let us go after other gods which thou
hast not known, and tet us serve them ; thou shalt not hearken unto the words
of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams" (Deut. xiii. 1, 2, 3).
Now let it be understood and admitted th~t falsehood as well as truth may

be communicated from the spiritual world, since there are evil and lying as
well as good and truthful spirits in that world, and let the mental or moral
conditions, which, according to Swedenborg, are necessary to secure any seer
against the seductive influence of lying spirits, be clearly seen, and men will
be in no danger from these "Revelations" by Davis, nor from any other similar
ones. For they will see that, however the things iii the book may have been
preternaturally communicated, they are not on tkat account necessarily true.
The seer, as well as all concerned in the book, may have been honest and
well-intentioned; but still he may have '.been, while in the mesmeric trance,
under the influence of a cla.Ss of spirits, whose real character and intentions
he knew nothing of; and he may have been used by them as a subject through
whom to communicate great and pernicious errors.
We now proceed to show, by a few references to the volume before us,
that the author must have been, some of the time at least, under the influence
of spirits "from beneath;" and has therefore given utterance to such thoughts
as these spirits may b~ supposed to have. The evidence of this, amply suf-
ficient to satisfy every believer in the christian religio;, may be seen in what
he says of the Lord, the Scripture, regeneration, sin and hell. His thoughts
on each of these subjects are certainly notworthy of a very exalted origin ; they
are worthy rather of spirits who·hate the Lord and His Word-who see not by
the light of heaven, but by that fatuous light which Swedenborg tells us the
devils see by. No christian, therefore, needs any further evidence of the
source of some of these " Revelations," than what they contain on these sub-
jects.
But· th'ere may be, and probably is, a considerable class of minds, honest,
but sceptically inclined who may wish for other eviqence that our clairvoyant
was under e. delusive influence, especially when he came to discourse upon
theology. For the benefit of such persons, therefore, we will refer to some
of his own inconsistencies and self-contradictions, and some of his palpable
contradictions of known factS, particularly in the passages where he speaks of,
or alludes to, the writings of Swedenborg.
On page 348 of the volume before us, the author, after giving an account of
the deluge, which differs considerably from the literal account given in the
Bible, says: "The original description of the flood [i. e. the scriptural account
of it] is, however, an entire spiritual, carrespondence-representing in an imperfect
manner this great catastrophe, which was the basis of the whole illustration.
The exact corresponden~ will be discovered and related hereafter: but it is well
io mention that it was by this volcanic occurrence and this great inundation
that the correspondence was suggested, ~aving an internal meaning; for it is
impossible for the account to have a literal signification.-! am impressed that
the internal meaning of many sayings that were apparently literal has not as
yet been properly and generally understood by mankind, notwithstanding their
true meaning was understood by those who wrote them, and has since been
unfolded to the world by an expanded and suitable intellect."
It 'is clear from this that the author recognizes an internal and spiritual sense
to the Scriptural account of the flood, aswell as to other parts of the Bible; and
considers the science of correspondences developed by Swedenborg, as the

true key to this spiritual sense. Forbe declares the Bible account of the flood
to be "an entire spiritual correspondence," and to possess " an internal mean-
ing;" and adds that the "true," " internal meaning of many sayings that were
apparently literal," bas "been unfolded to the world by an expanded and suita-
ble intellect." That Swedenlxrrg is the person here referred to, is obvious from
many other parts of the book.
· Moreover, on a previous page the author attempts to give us the wrrespond-
sme of several things mentioned in Genesis, as of the Garden of Eden, Adam
and Eve, the tree of knowledge, the aprons of fig-leaves, the land of Nod, Cain
and Abel, &c. We stop not here to inquire how far his correspondences are, or
are not, correct. It is sufficient for our present purpose that be declares that
these things have a correspondence.
He also speaks repeatedly of" the scimu of correspondences" (p. 72, and
elsewhere), and in one place says: "All things in forms and corporeal investi-
ture,'which exist upon the face of the earth as displaying life, are wrre5pofldent&
of their inner life or principle-which not only actuates them to thriftiness, but
is working b'y an undeviating law, the refinement of all subordinate substan-
ces" (p. 20). This shows what the author would have us understand by corres-
pondence, as he employs the term. It is " the relation of the inner principle or
unseen essence to the outward visible form-or therelation of cause and effect.,;
Now all this will be recognized by those familiar with the writings of the
great Swedish Seer, as very good Swedenborgian doctrine-whether true or
false, is not the point which we wish our readers now to consider. But what
says our clairvoyant in a subsequentpart of his book? And how does it cohere
with what is here said ? On page 403, after citing a passage from Genesis, and
mentioning the name of Swedenborg in connection with it, he adds : " But it is
impossible to find in these words as originally employed in the •primitive his-
tory,'• one particle of spiritual signification. It is not true that he [Swedenborg],
with all his enlightenment, unfolded an interior truth as expressed in these primi-
tive sayings-These primitive records do not contain, as divinely originated, a
minute spiritual meaning or application."
.'• Again, be says (p. 449) : "His [Swedenborg's] wrHings do not unfold a germ
of spiritual truth in those primitive pages, because it is ~mpossible for them to
contain such." And stronger still," I am not able to discover any such interior
meaning in any portion of the contents of the Word as he [Swedenborg] repre-
sents" (p. 588).
The reader will not fail to discover how palpably this author contradicts
himself on this subject; for in the first place he affirms that the Scripture ac-
count of the flood is " an entire spiritual correspondence,'' and bas " an internal
mea"ling,'' which, together with the true internal meaning of many apparently
literal sayings, "has been unfolded" by Swedenborg ; in another part of the vol-
ume be says, there is not, that he can discover," o~ particle of spiritual signifi-
cation" in the words of the " primitive history"-that Swedenborg'$. writings
"do not unfold a germ of spiritual truth in those primitive pages," because no
such truth resides there-and that he is unable " to discover any such in·

presents.
. Again: The author says, (p. 589): "I am much drawn to the pnre, gigantic,
and powerfully-intellectual spirit of Swedenborg. His philosophical revelatio\ls
are of vast importance, because of their truth ; and his spiritual and psychologi-
cal revelations are also qualifiedly tn1e, and are susceptible of being verified in the
spiritual spheres." And on the same page he further says, that when men's moral
and spiritual perceptions shall become sufficiently elevated by an abundant
supply of social requirements, "they will readily discover the signification of
his [Swedenborg's] spiritual teachings, which at present, to the mass of man-.,
kind, seem like the wildest hallucinations of a misdirected and inflated mind. . .
Therefore I discover this gigantic mind as in its conceptions transcending com-
pletely the ordinary powers, even of all interiorly enlightened men, and con-
sequently as· being removed from the natural i~to spiritual spheres. Hence
some of his mighty revelations will only be known to be tme when man as-
cends to a higher degree of wisdom and knowledge."
This is certainly high praise bestowed on Swedenborg, and a clear recogni·
tion of the general truth of his spiritual revelations. We should expect to find
one who could say all this, agreeing pretty closely with Swedenborg's teachings,
which he thinks too .pure and too exalted in wisdom to suit the present age of
the world. But what is the fact? We find the author, in other parts of his
book, guilty ofthe singular inconsistency ofdiffering toto Ullo from Swedenborg,
not only upon points of minor importance, but upon those which Swedenborg
regards as funik.mental ~n his theology-upon the existence of a hell in the
other world, upon the nature of sin, the need of regeneration, the divinity of the
Lord, and the divinity and sanctity of the Word. These are among the essential
doctrines in Swedenborg's system. Take these away, or so change them as to
suit the views of this book, and what would his" spiritual teachings" amount
to, or how would they cohere together? No man ever betrayed a profounder
reverence for the Word of God than Swedenborg. More than three fourths of
all his voluminous works on theology, are employed in unfolding the interior
and spiritual sense of the Word, thereby disclosing more clearly to the minds of
men its supreme divinity and sanctity. But Davis nttetly denies the inspiration
and sanctity of the Word, asserting that " the elements and qualities contained
In the Bible, or the germ of this·great theological tree, are positively- impure,
and unworthy of the interpretations and veneration which they have received"
(p. 541). He further says that" the Bible does not presentone proper concep-
tion of the constitution, character, greatness, omnipotence, and majesty of the
Divine mind-Nor does it teach that holy virtue, morality and refinement,
which should receive the name of religion" (p. 568). He declares that " sin, in
the common acceptation of that term, does not really exist:" he denies the
miraculous conception as well as the Divinity of our Saviour; and scouts the
idea of regeneration, becattse it implies, as he says, a degeneration, which he
denies (p. 517). And he·says that" the terms' satan,'' hell,' .• reward,' •P1V1·
ishment' &o., are terms which express as near the shadow ofno substance as
it is·possible for the mind to couceive" (p. 528). Nothing could be farther from
the teachings of S'!edenborg than all this) and yet (strange inconsiatency I) thia!

30 DAVIS1 REVELATIONS
Clairvoyant speaks of his (Swedenborg's)" mighty revelations" and" spiritual
teachings," as far transcending the wisdom of this age, as "in their promi-
nant features substantially true,'' and " susceptible of being verified in the spi-
ritual spheres."
And not less glaring are this author's inconsistencies on other points. Thus
on page 44, he describes what he calls " independent clairvoyance•: as a " state
in which one can view with clearness things belonging to a sphere of existence
higher than the natural world." And he says if any one were to go into this
state wluntarily, i.e. without the aid of a manipulator," that moment death
would necessarily and inevitably ensue"-" lndepencknt clairvoyance, therefore,
must be induced by the action of another system, by which the positive power
is extracted from the subject. To sustain life, this is supplied sympathetically
by the system of the operator." He admits however, that some may "go vo-
luntarily into a state in which the mind is greatly developed, and made cogni-
zant of principles and truths pertaining to this mundane sphere." Now as Sweden-
borg's state (whatever it was), was one into which he went without any aid
from another person, and also without suffering instant death, it could not, ac-
cording to our :author, be a state of:" independent clairvoyance," such as he
himself pxotessed to enjoy ; and this is ·positively affirmed on the next page.
Swedenborg, then, might have_been in·a state to render him" cognizant of prin-
ciples and truths pertaining to this mundane sphere," but not of " things belonging
to a sphere of existence higher than the natural world." Yet in a subsequent
part of the volume, he speaks of." the spiritual spheres-from which," he says,
" I am deeply impressed, flowed high and truthful impressions into the expand-
ed internal of this Swedish 'philosopher'' (p. 403). And still later in the volume
he speaks of Swedenborg's " spiritual and "psychologiwl revelations," and says
they " are susceptible of being verified in the spiritual spheres, and will be in
the disclosures soon to follow" (p. 589). And more explicit still is his language
on page 674: " A mind was sufficiently illuminated to have an actual 1'no'llJledge
of the relation and affinity existing bet'llJeen the natural and spiritual spheres, and of
the spheres to one another, and this was Emanuel Swedenborg." And again, he
observes, " this gigantic mind-as being removed from the natural into spiritual
sphereli'' (p. 589) ; and declares that Swedenborg's "illumination" was " the same
as his own" (p. 675).
How these statements cohere with what the author says in his "Key" about
- Swedenborg's "not being in independent clairvoyance," and therefore not cog-
nizant of " things belonging to a sphere of existence higher than tthe natural
world,'' we leave our readers to judge. Every one must see that the statements
are contradictory.
Again: this author refers his readers to Swedenborg'stheological writings, and
especially to a valubale work entitled " Summaria Expositio &nsus proph.etici."
"foratruthfulunderstanding ofthe contents" ofseveral ofthe books ofthe Bible (p.
449). Nowour first remark with regard to this is, that the Seer bas given not one
third ofthe Latin title of the work of Swedenborg to which he here refers his read-
1ers, and has given that fl1Tong. The title of the work as given by him would read,
when translated, " A Summary Exposition of the prophetiwl sense"-a sense, by
the way, of which Swedenborg tells us nothing. The true and full title of the

BRIEFLY EXAMINED. 31
work referred to, is, Summaria Expositio &nsw inmni Librorv.m Propktticorv.m
Verbi Veteris Ttstamenti, necnon et Psalmorum Davidis: "A Summary Exposition
of the internal aense of the prophetical books of the Old Testament Word, and of
the Psalms of David." And this title clearly expresses the design of the work,
which is, to unfold very briedy the internal or spiritual sense of the Prophets and
Psalms. And let the reader observe that this work is spoken of as " especially"
valuable among the works of Swedenborg, for giving a " truthful understanding
of the contents" of these books. Now if it has any value at all, it is on account
of the internal or spiritual sense which it discloses in the Psalms and Prophets,
for it has little to' do with any other sense. And the only " understanding of the
contents" of these books which it gives or attempts to give us, differing at all
from what we had before, is an understanding of their internal seme. And if this
be a "truthful understanding" of them, it must be because the internal sense
which~Swedenborg unfolds is true• .Yet our Clairvoyant, in the face of all this,
affirms repeatedly in other parts of his book, as we have already shown, that
there is no such interior meaning in any part of the Bible as Swedenborg repre-
sents.
Tme, he remarks, that, in reading the Swnmaria Ezpositio, " in order to com-
prehend properly the meaning of the author, great caution should be observed
in distinguishing the prominent principles whichi he develops;" a remark which
betrays his utter ignorance of the character of the work of which he speaks, and
involves him still deeper in inconsistency. For in the fust place, it is not a
treatise in which the author has attempted the development of any principles. It
is merely what its title imports-a brief exposition of the internal sense of the
Prophets and Psalms. · ADd one might, with about as much propriety, speak of
the prominent principles developed in a Dictionary, which does not profess to give
you more than the definition of words, as to speak in the manner our Seer does
of this little work. It needs but very little " caution," however to "distinguish"
the prominent subjects brought to view in the Sum.maria Ezpositio ; and these are,
the advent and supreme divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the inspiration and
sanctity of the Word, the punisltmen.t of those who falsify and profane the Word,
the reward of the faithful, the nature and subjugation of the hells, the assaults of
evil spirits or devils, and how the Lord protects men from them. Yet strange to
say, Mr. Davis, in other parts of his book, utterly denies the advent and divinity
of the Lord as explained by Swedenborg, rejects. the inspiration and sanctity of
.the Word altogether, and often speaks of it derogatorily ; and says that cc the
terms •satan,' • hell,' ' devil,' • reward,' ' punishment,' &c. are terms which
express as near the shadow of no substance as it is possible for the mind to
conceive" (p. 528 ; see also p. 519).
It turns out, then, that all the prominent mbjects explained or treated of by
Swedenborg in his Summaria Ezpositio, which should be carefully distinguished,
are mere dreams, phantasms, shadows-yea, worse, " the shadows of no sub-
stance." Yet our Seer refers his readers to this especially, as "a valuable .work,"
and one from which may be derived cc a truthful understanding of the contents"
of the Prophets I And although this work is, to the ordinary reader, perhaps the
least valuable of all Swedenborg's writings, being the most obscure of them all,
because the explanations of the spiritual sense are usually so brief that it is dif.

ficult to trace their coherence, yet Mr. Davis elsewhere says, there is "too much
obscurity, ambiguity, and spiritually-inflated conception, in his [Swedenborg's]
psychological works, for them to be ofany particular utility to the social world
at the present time" (p. 5&9). Was ever euch a tissue of inconsistency and con-
tradiction woven before ?
But we must tax our readers with a little more of the same sort. '·' There will
be observed," says our Clairvoyant, " an apparent discrepancy between the
things I relate [i. e. concerning the Scriptures] and those written by this Swe-
dish philosopher: and this discrepancy will appear conspicuous when the ex-
ternal of the account only is viewed, but not when his interpretations and cor-
respondences are properly compri;ihended" (p. 449). An " apparent discrepan-
cy!" But one which will vanish, when Swedenborg's " interpretations and
correspondences are properly comprehended!" No real discrepancy, then, in
regard to the Scriptures between this Seer and Swedenborg-the apparent one
arising from our not properly understanding the great Swede. Well, why don't
the Seer always tell us so? Why does he elsewhere and often deny the inspi-
ration of the Scriptures? Why does he aver that it contains " not one particle of
spiritual signification ?'' That he is unable " to discover any such interior
meaning in any portion of the contents of the Word" as Swedenborg repre-
sents? Why does he not always say that Swedenborg has taught the truth on
this subject, only that .he is not properly understood ? Why these contradic-
tions? Evidently because he saw not by genuine but Ly fatuous light.
Then as to the alleged fact of there being no real but merely an apparent dis-
crepancy between what he and Swedenbori;r have related of the Scriptures, we
think it would be difficult to state anything that could be farther from the truth.
Champollion has deciphered the meaning of the hieroglyphics on the monuments
of Egypt, and at the same time has placed in our hands a key to their mysteries,
which we may apply for ourselves. Now suppose a clairvoyant should arise
among us, and should give or pretend to give us a history of those singular in-
scriptions, the time when they were written and the persons who wrote them;
and suppose he should make mention of the men, horses, geese, lions, and all
the various symbols employed, and should lft the same time affirm that these
things have no such meaning asChampollion has ascribed to them-no mroning
beyond that which discloses itself to the ordinary English eye, and then in.the
same breath should declare tl!at there is no real but only an apparentdiscrepancy
between himself and the great French hierologist, what should we think of the
" clearness" of his vision ? Yet the remark would not be wider of the truth, nor
one whit more preposterous than this of our Poughkeepsie Clairvoyant. The
cases would be perfectly parallel.
Our Seer's intimation that Swedenborg's " interpretations and correspond-
ences" are not " properly comprehended," and hence the cause of the apparent
discrepancy alluded to, only betrays more clearly his utter ignorance of the sub-
ject of which he is speaking, while it looks like an attempt at the same time to
conceal his ignorance. Swedenborg declares that " the Word is written by
mere correspondences," and that "the Science of Correspondences is the key to
the spiritual sense of the Word." He has also expla~ed very fully what he
means by Corruporidlnce. And when he tells us that every natural object and

event mentioned ia the Word corresponds to something spiritual-that light, for
example, corresponds to truth-that.fire corresponds to love, either good or evil
-that darknus corresponds to falsity-that the eye corresponds to the under-
standing, or power of mental perception-that a m1>Untain corresponds to an
elevated state of love or charity-that a lamb corresponds to innocence, &c. &c.,
there is not much difficulty in understand.iDg what he means by such " corres.
pondences." And there is as little difficulty in understanding his "interyreta-
tions'' when he has hi.mSelf applied his key to the unfolding of the spiritual
sense, as he has to many parts of the Word. It is pretty obvious, therefore,
whence came, and what was the quality of the light by which our Clairvoyant
saw, when he affirmed that the apparent discrepancy between his revelations
and those of Swedenborg concerning the Scripture would dii!appear, when "the
interpretations i;nd correspondences [of the latter] are properly comprehended."
It could have been none other than the pale lurid light of the nether regions-" a.
light as from ignited coals."
Again : this author is equally inconsistent with himself in what he says of
the value or use of Swe<fenborg's revelations, sometimes referring his readers to
them as to works of espe~ial value, and at other times· declaring them to be of
no use. Thus the reader, as already shown, is referred especially to the Summaria
Expositio as " a valuable work.'' In anothel' place he says : " I am also im-
pressed to recOgnize the important revelations made by and through EMJ.iroi:r.
SWEDENBORG" (p. 587}. And,speakingof his "Worship and Looeof God," he says,
"this work is indeedarevealmentmuch to blread, appr1ciaUd, andpraetised''(P· 588)•
.Again he says, " The truths that he [Swedenborg] thus reveals concerning these
things [i.e. things in •the spirit-world'] are in tJery many particularssusceptible
of ben~tting the human race'' (ib). But shortly after he says, with characteristic
consistency, there is" too much obscurity, ambiguity, &c. in his psychological
works. for them to be of any particular utility to the social world at the present
time" (p. 589). And again he says," it is impossible to conceive ofthe practical
utilityofhis spiritual revelations to the disorderedworld at thispresent time."(ib),
Let these examples suffice to show our author's inconsistency with himself,
in regard to what he says of Swedenborg and his writings. We might easily
show him to be not less inconsistent with himself on other subjects; but it is
unnecessary, and aside from our present purpose.
Now whence flowed into the mind of our Seer such contradictory statements
as those we have referred to ? If they flowed from the same spiritual regiou, it
certainly could not have been a region of light. One who saw always by the
light of heaven, or who was in a state "to view with clearness" the things be-
longing to the higher mental spheres, would not so contradict himself.
Then there are in this book some plain and palpable contradictions of known
or provable facts. We shall coutent ourselves for the present with referring the
reader to a very few instances of this kind, though it were easy to multiply
them.
On page 449, after having given some account of several books in the Bible,
he says : "For a trotltfol understanding of the contents of some of the previous.
books, this, and/ollotDing ones, I would refer the reader to the theological writ

ings ofSwl:DENBOJlG, the enlightened philosopher..:especially to a valuable worll
entitled ' Summaria Exposi.tio &rl8fU Prophetici.' "
Here we are referred to the theological writings of Swedenborg cc for a truth·
Jul account of the contents" of the book ofNehemiah, for this is the book which
the author has just been speaking of, and which is referred to by the pronoun
this in the passage cited. But unfortunately for our Seer, Swedenborg baa given
in his theological writings no account, either truthful or untruthful, ·of the con-
tents of this book of Nehemiah. This, then, is a plain contradiction of a well
known fact-a fact of which every one can e&11ily satisfy himself.
On page 674, where the author asserts that the mind of Swedenborg "was
sufficiently illuminated to have an actual knowledge of the relation and affinity
existing between the natural and spirit¥al Spheres, and of the Spheres to one
another," he adds: cc He, however, employed terms to express the same thing.
that I have endeavored to impress by tenns of a different and more congenial
character.-He describes the first three Spheres as three hells, inhabited by lower
spirits and angels; while the three higher Spheres were ·the three heavens in
which the higher spirits and angels dwelt.-lt is, then, the use of terms, and their
particular application, that presents the apparent discrepancy existing between
his relations and these. And I can with assurance affirm, thal the conceptions
are the same in aubstance and true."
Here, then, we are told that the only difference between our Clairvoyant and
Swedenborg in relation to the spiritual Spheres, is in the use of terms, and that
their conceptions and relations on this subject " are the same in substance."
Davis' " first three Spheres," are the same as Swedenborg's three hel,ls, though
he does not choose to call them by that name. Now how stands the fact?
Our readers shall see ; for Mr. Davis has given us some account of his first three
Spheres, and so has Swedenborg of his three hells; and if what our clairvoyant
affirms be true, these accounts should agree in aubstiu.ce. We will first extract
a few passages from Davis' three lower Spheres, and then a few from Sweden·
borg's hells, that the reader may see whether the accounts be substantially the
same, differing O'llly in tems.
" The extended surface of this Sphere, I perceive, presents regular and gentle undulations,
which rende1 the whole diversified and exceedingly inviting. And very extensive,plains are
p~ted, which are clothed with great fertility, and with innumerable varieties of forms
such as deck the bosom of the earth when all things are fu.vorable to a thrifty production.
In those vast plains is represented the most perfect order. There are gardens, typical of
purity, unity, and celestial love. Their diversified paths continuany lead to new and in-
8U'Uctive portions, all of which are useful as displaying Divine Love and Wisdom, which
generate unity and affinity in all created things. All flowers, and even their ltut1n, are ob-
served as so many voices proclaiming the beauty of interior perfection, and the in11Di.te
Source from which they sprang. Every plant, flower, bird, and tiee, is perceived and ap-
preciated as the express creation of Divine.love aru1 Divine action. And there is a beauty
in the external of each created thing, which is of itself an open expression of celestial love
and wisdom. The flowers and foliage are of the most variegated appearance ; ILlld their
variety renders them instructive and im_pressive, insomuch that they act as e~hantments
upon the minds of those who behold them, and induce thoughts beautiful, elevating, and
edifying. A fJagaJlce perpetually ascends from those vast plains of creation, giviDg life and

b'fllliancy to the atmosphere, which is thereby rendered suitabl9 to be inhaled as the breath
oflove 8.nd exhaled as the thoughts of wisdom."-p. 653.
"Moreover, I behold here some of the most magnificent creations of Will and Wisdom.
It is well to remark, that everythingcreated in this Sphere is suggested by Love and perfected
by Wisdom-and is, therefore, a living projection from their minds-I discover constructions
ot the most grand and magnificent character, each having a brilliancy and illumination ac-
oo?ding to the advanced Slate ofthe society in which it is found.
" And there exisu among them a pervading happiness ; a soothing and tranquilizing ele·
ment of forgiveness and universal love; a cordiality in the bestowment of inherent love upon
each other, and a mingling, and yet perfect harmony, of thoughts, all of which it is delight·
ful to eontemplate."-p. 656.
" And a holy quietness pervades the whole spirit-world. There is happiness of the most
inexpressible character-and ecstacies, and exultations, and glorifications, are continually
aecending. There is so much purity and holiness, that my mind is l!C&l'Cely capable of
withstanding its moving inftuence.''-p. 659.
"There isa translucent beauty, and glory, and holiness, and happinese, that pervade and
cinicken into life the spirit-home, that defy all verbal expression. There is such a specific-
ness manifested in all things, and yet such an rnseparable unity and brotherly love, as can-
not be described, but is to be known only when experienced. It is impossible to portray
tile delights, the ecstacies, and the enchantments, which fiow into the IJlind as it is immersed
into this beautiful Sphere of spiritual existence."-p. 660.
" They have Love, Will, and Wisdom combined, and to a degree of perfection that
transcends all human thought. Their love is so pure that there is a visible radiation from
their countenances, and a halo of purity surrounding them that possesses inexpressible
attractions.-It is attractive to behold theit perfect Will, or the holy pensiveness of that
mculty, which is not prompted to an improper act, or to do one thing derogatory to the
general welfare."-p. 662.
"The inhabitants of the Third Sphere impart knowledge and express love to each other,
as the sun imparts life.and beauty to the forms ofearth.
"The whole [scenery of this Sphere] forms a volume whose contents are celestial, and
whose philosophy is the Divine Creator. Every passage which it contains proclaims good-
ness infinite, and every page unfolds volumes of immense love. The whole book is an
offspring of Wisdom-The spring, the rill, the stream, and the river, are introductions to
this great volume. The groves, ravines, and forests, are margins that cast a reflection on its
contents, and speak only ofharmony and inherent affection. The valleys, plains, and beau-
tiful gardens, abounding in all the luxuriant and immense creations of the spirit-,home, are
the impressed words on the leaves of this divine Book. And angels are the recipients of the
instruction thereof, through which their interior powers are expanded to the glory of the Di-
vine Mind for ever and ever. They drink at the fount ofWisdom, and walk in the fields and
gardens of celestial Love. They are incessantly employed in imparting blessings to those
who need, and meanwhile they receive in return the smiles and approbations of a delighted
heaven. Such are the combined beauties ofthe celestial Sphere."-p. 665.
Such is the uniform tenor of our clairvoyant's account of the character and
scenery belonging to the Second and Third Spheres, which, together with the
First, as he assures us, answer to Swedenborg's three hells. Tum now to
Swedenborg's treatise on Hell, and see how the accounts agree together. He
says:
" Inasmuch as there are in general three heavens, therefore a1llO in general there are three
hells.''-Heaom .§' Hell, tt. 542. !"

36 DAVIS• REVELATIONS
" Allwho are in the hells are in evils and the falses thence, and no one there is in evile
and at the same time in truths."-H. f' H. n. 551.
"All spirits in the hells, when inspected in any light of heaven, appear in the form of
their own evil ; for every one is an effigy of his own evil.-In general they are forms ofcon-
tempt of others, and ofmenaces against those who do not pay them respect; they are forms
ofhatreds of various kinds, also of various kinds of revenge; fierceness and cruelty from
their interiors are transparent through those forms.-Their mces are direful and void of we
like corpses.-Their bodies also are monstrous; and their speech is as the speech of anger,
or ofhatred or of revenge; for every one speaks from his own· fil.lsity, and the tone of his
voice is from his own evil ; in a word they are all images of their own hell.-It.is to be
known, however, that such is the appearance of the ilmmal spirits in the light of heaven,
whereas among themlel.ves they appear as men; this is of the Loid's mercy, Jest they
should seem as filthy one to another as they appear lierore the angels ; but that appearance
is a fallacy, for as soon as any ray of light from heaven is let in, their human ibrms are
turned into monstrous forms, such as they are in themselves, as tlescrlbed above ; for in the
light of heaven everything appears as it is in itself."-H. f' H. •· 553.
" This I can teetify that their wickedness is so great, that it is hardly possible to describe
even a thousandth part of it; and likewise, that unless the Lord protected man, it would
not be possible for him ever to be rescued from .hell; for with e'very man there are both
spirits from hell and angels from heaven : and the Lord cannot protect man, unless man
acknowledges a Divine, and unless he lives a lli6 of faith and charity, for otherwiee he
averts himselffrom the Lord, and turns himself to mremal spirits."-H. f' H. •· :S77.
Concerning the appearanus of the hells Swedenborg says :
" Some hells appeared to the view like caves and dens such as wild beasts inhabit in
forests ; some like to arched caverns and holes, such as are seen in mil'.les.-ln some beDs
there is an appearance as ofthe ruins of houses and cities after fires, in whieh ruins the in•
femal spirits dvrell and conceal themselves. In the milder hells there is an appearance as
of rude cottages, in ·some caees contiguous, having the aspect of a city with lanes and
streets; within in the houees are inf~mal spirits, engaged in continual quarrels, enmities,
blows, and fightings; in the streets and lanes robberies and depredations are committed.-
There are likewiee deserts, where is nothing but what is barren and sandy, and in some
places ragged rocks, in which are caverns; in some places are also huts."-H. t H. •. 586.
" The odors which· are from the perception of evil are most ungrareful, being fcetid as
those which ariee from putrid waters, from excrements, and from dead bodies ;-they who
are in hell are in the spheres of suchstenches; and what is wonderful, they who are in them
are not sensible ofthe horrid 11?116ll, yea, those stenches are delightful to them, and when ti:y
are in them, they arein thesphereoftheirdelightsanddainties."-Areawa C~lertia,fl. 4628.
Such is the.uniform tenor of Swedenborg's account of the character, appear-
ancef odors, &c. of his three hells. The reader will judge for hi.ntself whether
it differs from Davis' account of theFirst three Spheres, only in "terms." He will
see that the two accounts, so far from being "the samein Substance," as our clair-
voyant " 'l.IJitk assurance affirms," differ, as light and darkness, good and evil,
truth and falsity, beauty and deformity, fragrance and fetor, differ.
, Once more : According to our Clairvoyant, the spirits in the other life not
only go on improving and perfecting in wisdom each in his own Sphere, but
in the course of time they "ascend through all the~Spheres," from the lowest
to the highest, which he calls the Supercelutial. " Inasmuch as life is universal,"
he says, " death cannot mar the divine constitution of things; and by virtue of

this, the inhabitants of the Fourth Sphere, like those of. the others, repose for a
moment in silence, and awake as beings of the FuTH SPHERE or Superspiritual
habitation" (p. 669). Agaiu: "As bas been related of the transition of the spirits
and angels of the Spheres below, so do those of the Fifth Sphere ascend to, and
become the inhabitants of, the SIXTH, or the Superulutial habitation" (p. 671).
Thus the inhabitants of each of the three lower Spheres, which he assures us
are the same as Swedenborg's three hells, are perpetually advancing towards'e
Sixth or Supercelestial Sphere, and will all finally attain to it.
Now the reader will please to bear in mind that our author says Swedenborg
had " an actual kMU1ledge of the relation and affinity existing between the natu- :
ral and spiritual Spheres, and of the Spheres to one-another." And be declares
that it is merely the use of terms and their particular application, "'that pre·
sents the apparent discrepancy" existing between their relations concerning the
Spheres. .But our Clairvoyant, so far from teaching "the same in substance" as
Swedenborg has taught respecting the progress of spirits in the other ~~ri~
from the lower to the higher Spheres, has plainly and most emphatically cotr.:'.
tradicted him. For Swedenborg uniformly teaches that those who become evil
spirits, or who enter some infernal society in the other world, remain there to
all eternity. There is no such thing to be found in his writings, as those in hell
or the" three lower Spheres," ascending to heaven or the Sphel'es above them,
so as permanentlyto dwell there. He everywhere declares this to be impossible.
And although he teaches that the 11ngels ·of each heaven will for ever continue
to progress in wisdom and in love, yet their progress 'fill be in that particular
Sphere or heaven where each one finds himself in the oiber life. He assures us
that those of the lower heavens can never advance through a discrete degree,
and thus become angels of a higher heaven. (On this subject see A. C. 4588,
8206, 3993, 4464, 9594; C. L. 524 ; H. &. H. 480, 363; D. L. W. 238.) The as-
sertion of our Clairvoyant, therefore, that ~denborg agrees substantially with
him on this subject, is one quite contrary ~e truth. The obvious disagree·
ment is not greater in terms, than it is in substance.
But enough,and too much. We have pursued the subject considerably farther
than we intended-farther than we should have done, but for the interest which
this work has excited in the commnnity.. And yet we have only noticed some of
the author's inconsisteQcies and palpable ~rs in point of fact, in the passages
where he speaks of Swedenborg and his writuig1.1. We have taken no notice of
his errors on other subjects. And this much, we think, is certain from what we
have here shown, that, however learnedly and fluently the Clairvoyant may seem
to discourse on some subjects, be does notalways receive truthful impressions,
but often those that are quite otherwise ; for he repeatedly contradicts not only
himself, butfacts thatare well known. His numerousand palpable blunders are,
to our minds, sufficient to establish the genuineness or alleged origin ofthe book,
and to repel the charge of imposturebrought against the individuals concerned in
getting it up. For we cannotthinkthatanicunningoringeniousmen-anymen
capable of writing such a book, or of conceiving such a gigantic hoax,would,in
their normal state, have blundered so often and so stupidly as this abnormalistbas.
But we have known Clairvoyants-even the best of them-to make just such
blunders before, and still to be quite as posit.iv.e, even as Mr. Davis himself, thal

they were right. Whoever discovers this author's mistakes on other subjects--
some of which it has been our purpose here t.o expose, will be in little danger
of being misled or banned by his monstrous theological errors. For they will
see that the lt1n11n in which his mind must have been often, if not always, im-
mersed, was of such a doubtful. or peculiar nature, as t.o render him the most
unsafe of all teachers, especially upon lofty spiritual themes. They will see
tbf his pretended "Revelations" possess not the sligh.telt authority, and that not
one tDOrd ofthem, beyond what is capable of being demonstrated upon otherand
wholly independent grounds, is worthy the least credit. And in conclusion we
would add, t.hat the writings of Swedenborg lead us t.o expect, under all the cir-
cumstances, justsucha mixture of truth and error as this book contains. These
writings 8re the best " counterfeit detector'' of which we have any knowledge,
and we would, therefore, recommend them t.o others as the surest safeguard
against the specious falsitiel of these and all similar " Revelations."

lAs there is doubtless a strong propensity in the public mind, from the relations in which
Swedenborg's disclosures have beetl. presented to those of Mesmeric Clairvoyan~ to regard
\hem as substantially of the same nature, we have deemed it expedient to in..oert the following
-extractfrom a Review of" Mesmer and Swedenborg·.'' published in the Boston New Jerusa•
lem Magazine for January, 1847. The distinction so ably drawn betWeen the case of Swe-
<denborg and that of 1lil maglietic subjects will scarcely leave it po~sible hereafter \0
<ionfound them. The article is from the pen .of TtmoPntLus PARSONS, Esq., of Boston, the
author of the very interesting volume of" Ess.&Ys" published about two years ago,whichhave
'delightedand edified so many readers.] '
"Now let us compare~·this case with that 'Of Swedenborg. We perceive at
once this important point 'Of difference. Mr. Davis's normal, or natural, or com-
mon i:;tate, has no apparent connection whatever with his clairvoyant state..
Doubtless there is a ·oonnection which we cannot perceive, between the pecu-
liarities ofhis constitution-physi~, inrellectual, or moral-and this extraordi-
nary clairvoyance. But it ii! certain that neither the atn'Ount nor the character
'Of his knowledge while clairvoyant, have any perceptible relation whatever
with the amount or chatacter of his knowledge in the natural state. These two
things do not differ in degree; thatis, Davis does not know a little of cosmogony
and philosophy, and think a little about them in his natural state, and then know
and think a vast deal more on the same subjects while clairvoyant; but in this
last state he has a marvellous quantity of knowledge on topics whereon in his
natural state he has never in his life known or thought any one thing great or
small.
"In the next place, it does not at all appear, that Davis's fitness or capability
for this clairvoyance, or for the learning be there acquires or utters, is the re-
sult of any intellectual training. He has never been a student, never a practised
and logical thinker; and has never acquired, by careful discipline and sustained
endeavor, the power of profound and coherent meditation. It is not by reason
of these things, or ofany ofthem.. in any degree, that he is able to learn and tell
in ·a state of clairvoyance, the wonders of cosmogony, or of any branches of
science or philosophy.
" The ne:itt thing to observe (and it is one of great importance), is, that Davis,
in his natural state, knows nothing whatever of his magnetical state. They who
looked on and saw can tell him what was done to him and what he did; they
who listened and took notes can repeat to him what he said; but of all this he
knows nothing himself ; absolutely nothing more than if the Davis of the one
APPENDIX,
state, and the Davis of the other were two persons, living in distant countries:
without any intercourse with, or any knowledge of each other. And when they
who heard him, repeat to him what he has said, they repeat it for the most part
in vain, for he can comprehend it but very imperfectly ; his own reason has not
the preparation nor the power required to ascend to this lofty elevation. Thus
it is with Mr. Davis; and all of this is in accordance with the usual phenomena
of mesmeric clairvoyance, of which Mr. Davis may well be regarded as a type.
" And now how is it with Swedenborg ? In the first place he was prepared for
his illumination not only by a thoroughly moral and religious character, but by
very many years most dilligently and moft successfully devoted to the acqui-
sition of a vast fund of knowledge. Aud this learning; immense in its extent,
and embracing most of the branches of science, was nevertheless closely and
definitely related to the higher learning which be afterwards acquired. It in
fact became the foundation of his spiritual knowledge, and served him in com-
prehending spiritual truths in all their relations, and in illustrating them for the
minds of others. In the next place he was prepared for bis illumination by a
long and careful intellectual discipline. Naturally a close and steadfast thinker,
he became by study one of the first mathematicians in the world ; and the effect
of this exact and rigorous science, was to give clearness, precision, and accuracy
to his reasoning powers. And all this was for the end that he might use these
powers in understanding spiritual truth when it should be opened for him. It
was designed for this end, and it had this effect. His eyes were opened, and he
saw things of 'he spiritual world; his ears were opened and he heard its wisdom;
and because of the thorough preparation of his wonderful· mind, he understood
what he saw, and drew just inferences from the phenomena around him, and
grew in the wisdom of heaven while yet an inhabitant of earth. Lastly, and
most importantly, between the state of Swedenborg when under illumination,
and his normal, natural or common condition, there was no separation, no dis-
union, no impaseable abyss. Wtiat he saw or learnt while under spiritual illu-
mination, made him wiser in his natural condition. It was for the purpose of
becoming wis~r in his natural condition, that his. eyes were opened, and his
preternatural condition induced ; because it was in and through his natural and
normal faculties, and by l;iis own )aborious exertion of these faculties, that the
effect of his own growth in knowledge and wisdom was to be produced upon
the world. ·
"But Swedenborgand Davis agree in this, that their knowledge comes to them
in ways which are not the common ways of human nature. Just so far as thia
goes, there is an analogy between them ; but here is its preciee limit; for if we
go a step farther; if we look to see whether the ways are the same or similar in
th}·two men; we shall fiud, instead• of resemblance or analogy between them,
the marks of difference, of contrast, of opposition. And this contrast we should
express or describe as follows :
"All men receiveall oflife from the Lord, by the·medium of the spiritual world.
It is of the extremest importance that .we should know this, and remember it.
Consequently, nothing is more frequently, and more emphatically asserted in the
works of Swedenborg. He who thinks a just thought, who knows that he haa
learnt some new truth, who is conacions that he has a good and pure affectiot.

wltoltasthe :rightofbelieovingthat he baa done one good thing-allthisgoodand
truth, and all that is good and true. in or about him, he should refer to the Lord
as to the only source of all that is good and true, acknowledging that he himself
is only a recipient oflife from Him who is life itself. But this truth does not
:stand alone ; nor is it the office of this truth to tak.e from us freedom or re-
sponsibility, or plunge us into the torpor of fatality. For in connection with
this truth, and always conjeined wita it, is another wllich tella m thatwe have
always the power, and always the duty, to be, to feel, and to ~t as ofourselws.
Swedenborg says ofthis, in one of hisrelations, 'Man can, as ofhimulf, reform
and regenerate himself, provided he in heart acknowledge that it is from the
Lord. Every one who performs actual repentance, and believes in the Lord,
is reformed and regenerated; man is to do both as ofhimMlf, but the u OJ' HIM·
si:u, is from the Lord. . • This is the only reciprocal of love and faith,
which the Lord absolutiely wills to be done to Him by man.• T. C. R. 621.
"While it is true thatwhateverwe have is the gift of the Lord, it is alsotrue
that among these gifts, is our own individual personality,is freedom, is ration-
ality, and the conscious possessionof these things. It isthrough these things,
through the conscious possession of them, and 'through the free and voluntary
use and employment of them, that we may be taught, imp?Gved, regenerated,
saved. Such is the law of human life ; and as far as we llave any evidence
whatever, the case of Swedenborg was no exception, but an instance of the
moBt complete conformity ; we have no reason to believe tllat there ever lived
a 1
:f>erson in regard to whom this law existed in fuller force, or with greate•
elect. Never was there a man farther from the state of one who is the blind
:and involuntary instrument of others. It was for the purposes of Providence
that Swedenborg became wise beyond others,that he might teachthe gronnds
and means of this wisdom, and thus open the way for the progress of man-
kind in new directions. For this purpose hewas, in tb.e first plaoe, thoroughly
educated as a youth ; next, employed and practised 'as a man in the functions
and studies adapted to invigorate and discipline his remarkable powers; and
lastly, permitood to see in the various regions of the spiritual "M>rld, things
which became to him food for deeper thought, and the means of higher wis-
dom. But they thus nourished his understanding, and gave him wisdom, for
the very reason that he had been thus pecUllarly and thoroughly prepared to
see, and Mar, and know these things profitably. And while his eenses were
so opened, and he was employed in gathering the gifts so vouchsafed to him,
he was never any less in the exercise of his own rationality, never le11s free,
less himself, than when he was a youth at college, or the great engineer and
practical mathematician of hitsovereign, Charles XII. In a few words, and
to use an impo.rtant distinction, made by Swedenborg himself in another rela-
tion, it is not accurate to say that the wisdom of the heavens came through
Swedenborg to the earth; but that it came first to Swedenborg, and being pos-
sessed Irv him, came forthfrom him, by his own act, done as ofhimself.
" We suppoee nothing of thiskind,and nothing at all likeit, is true inthecase
of Davis or of any mesmeric clairvoyant. There, the rationality of the indi-
vidual is silenced, superseded, suppressed ; or, it is occupied and used by
others ; his freedo111 is annihil!Ued. Insome cases, the ha.wlsand limbs move

in obedience to the will of another, and the tongue tastes, the eyes see, th6'
ears hear, and the nose smells, as if the soul of that other was within them ;.
and in other cases, the subject is invigorated with a life not his own, his eye
brightens, and his lips pour forth the knowledge and thoughts of other minds,
while the subject himself has no more to do with all this than the air whose
undulations make the sounds he utters-no more than if he were dead, and
it were possible to reanimate his corpse, and make it vocal by galvanism or
milgic. After awhile this possession passes away. The subjectretums to his
nonnal state ; he is no longer a subject in any sense, but free; no longer
another but himself. And then how is it 1 Every man who heard him speak,
has somewhat of what he said when mesmerized; the sense, if it were com-
prehensible, or the sound of the words at all events in his memory; but the
subject, or he who was the subject and then pomed forth this utterance, has
of it.all now, now that he is himself, NOTHING. What else, then, can we con-
clude, than that the state of Swedenborg is as opposite to the state of a clair-
voyant, as earnest of a high rationality is opposite to its inaction ; as being
one's own is opposite to being another's ; as freedom itself is opposite to the
absolute control of another; as the full and rejoieing exercise of all that .con-
stitutes the free, rational, conscious individual, is opposite to its sleep, sus-
pension or suppression.
"We do not mean to say, that the clairvoyant's susceptibility or the value of
his disclosures have no reference whatever to the character of his understand-
ing. It is perhaps probably otherwise; although we do not pretend to decide
this question with any confidence. . They who are actually speaking through
the clairvoyant, may not speak through his lips alone, but through his will
and his understallding, of all of which they may have possessed themselves
for that time. And the possibility of doing this, or the degree in which it may
be done, doubtless depends more or less upon the original or acquired char-
acter of the man's mind or body. But what we mean is, to refer to a perfectly
obvious fact, which is certainly a general if not a universal characteristic of
clairvoyance of all kinds and degrees ; and that is, the want of all connection
between the mesmeric condition, and the state of free, voluntary, rational in-
dividuality ; or, in other words the state of the man himself.
" From these views our opinion of the true relation between Mesmerism and
Swedenborgianism, may easily be inferred. We hold the New Jerusalem to
be eminently a free church, and a rational church. There is much involved
in these few words, much that we shall perhaps take occasion hereafter to
develop at greater length. In this connection -recan only say, that we think
an intelligent comprehension and a careful consideration of the history of pre-
ceding churches, will lead one to the conelusion, that there has been, from the
beginning, a gradation in this respect, of which the New Church is the close
and crown. In the most ancient times, when the inhabitants of ·earth
breathed and pulsated with the heavens, as Swedenborg infonns us, theS&
were as the children of heaven. Afterwards, the Jewish Church was address-
ed by miracles of terror or persuasion, of menace or reward, and a faith was-
offered them which made no claims upon their understanding. Then came
the first Christian Church, with its sanctions and its evidence of a far higher

character, still using miracles as its evidence, and threats and promises as its
sanctions, but addressing itself, in a good degree, through the understanding
to the heart. Now, from the same heavens from which all that is good and
true comes down, the New Jerusalem is descending. It renounces all this
kind of evidence, and all the peculiar sanctions which belong to the lower
planes of the past. The church. has now ascended a higher region, and ap-
peals with pure and absolute exclusiveness to the rational faculty, and to those
affections to which this faculty is an avenue. Not that she rejects all other
good ; she rejects no good, embracing all ; the good of childlike simplicity;
of mere obedience, or of motives of persuasion. But these are not the chil-
dren born in her own house; and she welcomes and embraces all of them,
that she may elevate them to or towards that free and voluntary reception of
truth and good in the understanding and the will, which is peculiarly her own.
Whatever other good may be within her borders, is not the less but the more
good for being there ; but it is only upon free, voluntary, rational good and
truth, that her own name and seal are set.
"It is we think because the New Jerusalem has now descended with these
powers and functions, that Mesmerism is now permitted to appear. It does
not deal with truth, it does not quietly address the understanding and the af-
fections, jealously respecting free and voluntary rationality, and conscious in-
dividuality, as the only basis of its own operations; but at once assails or
paralyzes these, or takes plenary possession of them, or casts them into a sleep
like the sleep of death ; while it possesses and uses the man at its own plea-
sure. But a few generations since this could not have been permitted, for
there was nothing upon earth able to meet and control it. Now, however, it;
jJ.as come. Come, liable to abuse and mischief undoubtedly, but we are willing.
to believe capable also of doing good and peculiar good, if, and so far as, it is
under the control and government ofreason and religion; of a reason rejoicing
in the light and faithful to the guidance of a true religion.
" Swedenborg speaks of ancient magic as a reality. And since the exist-
ence of-Mesmerism, it is common to find writers about it, explaning the strange
phenomena of ancient religions or superstitions, or suggesting th!lt they may
hereafter be explained, by supposing that Mesmerism then also existed. In
this there is doubtless some truth ; and if any are offended by our likening
Mesmerism to magic, we hope it will ·be remembered that magic itself was
but the abuse of powers and relations which in their original purity were
fruitful of good. We have yet but the beginning of Mesmerism. It may go
on and develop a power of mischief, which it would fill us with horror to an-
ticipate ; but we believe it will also have a power of good, which should be
turned to good account. We hope its unquestionable influence upon disease
and pain will one day be hallowed by relations which will leave that power
undiminished while they make it safe. And as a science, as disclosing facts
and laws relating to the laws of vitality and the intercourse of the soul with
the body, and the nature of spirit, we believe it may prove itself a valuable
instructer."
