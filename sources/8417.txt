  INTRODUCTION

  Studies done in the late 70's   and early 80's provide much of the foundation for today's understandings of the   near death experience (NDE).&nbsp; One of the distinguishing factors unique to NDEs   is the reports of beings, deceased relatives, and the implications resulting   from these contacts.&nbsp;

  Michael B. Sabom took great   care to document his studies in his book, Recollections of Death,   published in 1982 (Sabom, 1982). He showed that what NDErs saw and heard while   they were dead, had a factual basis.&nbsp; These people could accurately recall   events happening around them.&nbsp; The Dutch NDE study in 2001, headed by Pim van   Lommel, replicated the phenomena and described a patient's veridical perception   out-of-body experience (van Lommel, 2001).&nbsp; Although there are scientists, such   as Russell Noyes, who initially set out to prove that imminent death produced   hallucinations of the mystical category with &quot;intense visual imagery&quot;   representing &quot;a more complete withdrawal from extreme circumstances (Noyes,   1984),&quot; this cannot explain why NDErs can see, hear and accurately recall   happenings in the same or other rooms.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  Just as this out of body   component is considered a core and real component unique to NDEs, so is the   component of meeting beings during the experience.&nbsp; As noted by Charles Flynn,   an early NDE researcher, he quoted the words of sociologist William I. Thomas,   &quot;If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences&quot; (Flynn,   1984, p. 279).&nbsp; The sentiments were echoed by Kenneth Ring by saying, &quot;Such   experiences . . . tend to exert a powerful effect on a person's motivations,   values, and conduct. . . However one chooses to interpret near-death phenomena,   they are unquestionably real in their effects&quot; (p. 279).

  Kenneth Ring noted in his   study, that the presence of beings could be sensed and sometimes communicated   with at the stage after a person leaves their body.&nbsp; (Ring, 1984) This may or   may not be part of the tunnel phase.&nbsp; Further, twenty percent of the persons who   had experienced a presence at this stage in their NDE, reported drastic changes   in their lives based upon the contact with the deceased individual.&nbsp; He also   noted that one-tenth of the NDErs went to the final stage he termed as &quot;entering   the light.&quot;&nbsp; Beings are more commonly seen during this stage.&nbsp; He commented on   several persons who reported seeing deceased relatives (p. 34).

  According to the Greyson NDE   Scale, the transcendental component has the highest correlation with the other   three components. (Greyson, 1984). &nbsp;This transcendental component is defined by   Ken Ring, as a transpersonal experience.&nbsp; (Ring, 1984, p. 36).&nbsp; The NDE is a   transpersonal state of consciousness in 'which an individual transcends the   usual ego boundaries as well as the dimensions of time and space' (p. 36).&nbsp;   Therefore, based on Greyson's scale, beings play a crucial part in the   transcendental nature of the NDE.

  Interestingly, on Greyson's   preliminary questionnaire, 26% saw beings.&nbsp; On the final NDE scale, the question   reads &quot;Did you see deceased spirits or religious figures?&quot; and correlated the   question as part of the transcendent component unique to the near death   experience (Greyson, p. 53).&nbsp; Van Lommel noted that of 62 patients reporting a   NDE, 32% met with deceased persons.&nbsp; (van Lommel, 2001).&nbsp;

  Since beings represent a   unique and transcendental part of the near death experience, this paper will   explore what beings people encounter when they go to the other side.&nbsp; This paper   represents the second part of a six part study to find out about Soulmates.&nbsp; The   first study discussed the background of the Soulmate study as viewed through the   lens of consciousness studies.&nbsp; This second paper will focus on relationships   between the NDEr, the living, and those on the other side.&nbsp; I will also add to   the knowledge of what categories of deceased beings or religious figures are   most commonly reported.

  METHODOLOGY

  This study is a retrospective review of data received from   an Internet survey on the Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF)   website     www.nderf.org (Long, 2002).[1]  &nbsp;    Out of a total of 626 experiences submitted to the website, 302 of these   experiences met the research definition of NDE as defined as, &quot;A lucid   experience associated with perceived consciousness apart from the body occurring   at the time of actual or threatened imminent death&quot;&nbsp; (Long).&nbsp; It was then   determined which of the 302 NDEs answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Did you meet or   see any other beings?&quot; and &quot;If yes or uncertain, describe.&nbsp; Where were they? Did   you know them? What was communicated?&quot;&nbsp; Earth beings seen during the veridical   perception phase of the NDE were excluded.&nbsp;

  Dr. Long developed an Excel   based chi-square calculation engine based on over 2,000 data points.&nbsp;   Calculations are automatically updated when new data is added.

  Out of the 302 NDEs, 212   (70.1%) reported encountering beings.&nbsp; The beings were divided into   familiar and unfamiliar categories based upon whether they described beings or   not.&nbsp; Out of the 212 who reported encountering beings, only 166 (78%)   described the beings they encountered.&nbsp; Each account was counted only once.&nbsp;   Beings counted were those beings that were seen, sensed, and part of the   universal consciousness.&nbsp;

  In the familiar category,   there were divisions for religious beings, blood relatives, relatives, and   other.&nbsp; In the unfamiliar category, divisions were for male, female, genderless,   and others.&nbsp; Although many people reported seeing more than one being during   their experience, the count is one NDE and one being.&nbsp; For example, while Jesus   may have been seen in the same experience as Grandma was seen, Jesus also   appeared in 21 other different experiences.&nbsp; Grandma was tabulated once and   Jesus was tabulated once for this one experience.&nbsp;

  Analysis was also performed   on the two categories: 1) all beings; and 2) only familiar beings.&nbsp; Each group   was then compared in terms of age of the experiencer at the time of the NDE and   whether they saw multiple, one or two beings.&nbsp; Multiple NDEs and those that an   age was not given could not be used.&nbsp;

  RESULTS

  Of the 302 people who   responded to the survey, 29% (88) saw familiar beings and 25.8% (78) saw   unfamiliar beings.&nbsp; Of the 166 people who saw beings, 53% saw familiar beings,   while 47% saw unfamiliar beings.&nbsp; For those experiences who saw multiple beings,   they may have been counted in several categories of familiar and unfamiliar   beings.&nbsp; However, for each being that was seen, there was only one experience   counted.&nbsp; For instance, in one account, a person may have seen Jesus and   non-specific angels.&nbsp; Jesus would have been tabulated once under familiar   religious figures, and there would be a tabulation mark for unfamiliar religious   figures.&nbsp; Out of 166 experiencers who saw beings, this one experience would   count only once as seeing Jesus.&nbsp; Also, of 166 experiencers who saw beings, this   one experience would count only once as seeing non-specific angels.&nbsp; Therefore,   it is valid to say that a total of 21 experiencers saw Jesus or a total of 9   experiencers saw angels.&nbsp; However, it would be incorrect to cross-compare those   experiences seeing multiple beings by using all of the tabulated experiences   below such as n=226.&nbsp; The break down of familiar and unfamiliar beings is as   follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

  A t-test was done for whether   there was any correlation to seeing beings, whether or not the beings were   familiar, blood relatives, or religious figures.&nbsp; There is no correlation   between age and what beings are seen where p value accepted as significant is   p&lt;0.01.&nbsp; However, there is a trend towards seeing familiar beings and blood   relatives if p&lt;0.05.&nbsp; Below are the results:

  Using the same criteria as   the t-test except breaking the data into age groups, the chi square table shows   no correlation between age and what beings are seen, if any.&nbsp; The age groups   used were children (0-17), ages 18-40, and age 41 and over.&nbsp; There was a trend   (.099) towards the older an experiencer was at the time of their NDE, the higher   chance they would encounter a familiar being.

  I also tried smaller   categories to see if it would make a difference.&nbsp; I used the ages 0-12, 13-17,   18-25, 26-40, 41-55, and 56 and over.&nbsp; There was a trend (.062) towards older   people to see blood relatives.&nbsp; Although the correlation between expected and   observed for seeing familiar beings was .094, there was no trend.&nbsp; Some age   groups and others were down, with no clear pattern.
  
  The datum was divided   into how many beings were seen during the experience.&nbsp; It looks like the ratio   of beings per experience is about the same regardless of whether or not the   beings are familiar, and that it is slightly more common to see one being   instead of many beings.&nbsp; Below are the results:

  There is no correlation   between age and the likelihood of seeing one or more beings.&nbsp; The ratios between   the categories of 'all beings' and 'familiar beings' remains fairly constant:   with a slightly greater chance of encountering only one being during the   experience.

  There were many statistically   significant correlations that cannot be attributed to chance alone.&nbsp; The   chi square results are shown below:                                 n=250, p&lt;.01            Seeing Beings&nbsp;                    Beautiful locations            3.87E-09                    Universal Order/Purpose            3.59E-05                    Seeing a Light            2.92E-05                    Decision to Return            5.38E-05                    Tunnel            0.000903576                    Share Experience            0.000501235                    Life Change            0.001414808                    Changed Beliefs            0.008022381                    Future Life Events            0.004492182</span>

  Those who encountered beings   were more likely to perceive of a universal purpose or order.&nbsp;   Additionally, those who saw beings were more likely to report the classic NDE   elements of seeing a light, beautiful locations, and the tunnel.&nbsp; Reports   of seeing future events was more likely to be delivered by other beings.&nbsp;   Other beings were associated with the decision to return.&nbsp; Those who   reported seeing beings were more likely to have changed beliefs and a life   change.&nbsp; They were also slightly more likely to share their experience with   others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  DISCUSSION

  Compared to Greyson and van   Lommel, 49% of NDErs responding to the web survey said they saw beings.&nbsp; Some of   the increased number could be explained by what was scored as a being.&nbsp; Prior   subjects may well have focused on literally what they could see.&nbsp; Our study was   more inclusive in that it included beings whose presence could be sensed and   those beings that may not have been human, such as angels.&nbsp; In the van Lommel   study, it is unclear if the answers included religious figures.

  While many of the results of   the chi-square analysis make sense intuitively, this is the first time these   results have been scientifically verified.&nbsp; With p&lt;.01 and n=250, the   results are highly reliable.&nbsp; Seeing beings seems to serve an integral part   of both, the NDE itself and the integration process of the NDE afterwards.&nbsp;   Those who reported contact with other beings during the NDE, were involved in   the decision to return and they had a sense of universal purpose.&nbsp; Those   who saw beings were more likely to have changed beliefs and a life change,   suggesting that the universal purpose or order is different than earthly purpose   and order.&nbsp; It would logically follow that the changes would incorporate   the new understandings gained from the NDE but this is beyond the scope of this   paper.&nbsp; However, the topic will be more fully explored in an upcoming paper   entitled, &quot;New Religious Understandings from the Near-Death Experience.&quot;

  Out of the initial 212 who   reported seeing beings, 78.3% (166) described the beings they saw or sensed.&nbsp;   Although there is no significant correlation as to whether individuals see   familiar or unfamiliar beings, or whether the beings are blood relatives or not,   there is a trend towards seeing familiar beings and for seeing blood relatives.&nbsp;

  The highest percentage of   familiar beings seen were blood relatives (25.9%), followed by religious figures   (22.9%).&nbsp; In looking at whether the angels (or the opposite) were counted among   familiar beings, they were counted as familiar if they were named or called   'guardian angel.'&nbsp; If non-specific, they were counted as unfamiliar.&nbsp; Also of   interest is the categories of 'familiar unknowns' (9.6%) and the 'at one with   all' (2.4%).&nbsp; There is a weak trend that the older an experiencer is at the time   of the NDE, the more likely they will see blood relatives.&nbsp; Religious figures   are seen and recognized by all ages.

  In reports of unfamiliar   beings, it seems more likely that gender is not important, or at least not as   important as other characteristics.&nbsp; People report them as just 'beings' or a   'presence.'&nbsp;

  It makes sense that more   people would see their grandparents on the other side because grandparents would   be more likely to pass to the other side than parents, siblings, or children.&nbsp;   However, it is curious that grandfathers would more likely appear with   grandmothers than to appear solely by themselves.&nbsp; This is a bit odd in light of   the fact that only two people saw significant others on the other side.&nbsp;   Although it can be said that seeing significant others on the other side would   be less likely due to relative similarity in the age of the experiencer and the   significant other, it seems odd that more significant others were not seen on   the other side.&nbsp; This would make one wonder about the popular conception of   Soulmates.&nbsp;

  Data gathered from the     www.adcrf.org website about after death communications   (ADC) also shows a curious link between blood relatives and communication   between loved ones.&nbsp; Analyzed were 238 contributions to the ADC website form   exploring the relationship between the deceased and the person reporting the   ADC. Surprisingly, 46 (19%) of the contacts occurred within 24 hours or less.   Moreover, 35 (76%) of the 46 contacts occurred between blood relatives. Only 5   (14%) occurred between significant others.&nbsp;

  In 2001, a study of 120 NDEs using NDERF data collected   from the     www.nderf.org website, a surprising find was that more   parents came back for children, grandparents for grandchildren, or children came   back for parents, than any other reason when given a choice to return to earth   or not.&nbsp;

  The connection between blood   relatives and consciousness is intriguing.&nbsp; It is my hypothesis that traditional   views of relationship roles are very different than the myths of popular   culture.&nbsp; A possible pattern that fits the data is that we may be seeing a   spectrum of relationships across the board of consciousness.&nbsp;

  Religious figures could be on   one end of the spectrum and represent the larger cosmic group we belong to.&nbsp;   This is further supported by NDE reports of becoming part of the greater cosmic   consciousness.&nbsp; The fact that NDErs mention familiar unnamed beings is   significant as it could suggest some kind of predestination or soul recognition   of another group member.&nbsp;

  Relatives could represent a   microcosm of our own, unique soul group that we travel through time with.&nbsp; There   clearly are some connections between blood relatives that would suggest purpose,   or at least preconceived knowledge of the existing bond that affects our   relationship on earth.&nbsp; Many times, the expressed desire is to teach, comfort or   protect the person on this side.&nbsp; The most exciting concept of relatives has to   do with the relationship between the DNA of relatives and the observed soul   bond.&nbsp; These soul cluster groups appear to be what we would really envision when   we think of a Soulmate; someone with whom we spend eternity.&nbsp;

  There are many reasons why we   consider significant others as Soulmates according to our cultural myths.&nbsp; From   this study, it does not appear that significant others are as likely to be with   us in the hereafter as it does for blood relatives.&nbsp; However, I would stress   that this does not mean that significant others cannot be with us on the other   side.&nbsp; Grandparents appearing in pairs would suggest that significant others can   remain together.&nbsp;

  In future papers, I will   discuss the role of the significant other and hope to explore how they might fit   into our development of consciousness. Additionally, the focus on relationships   will be discussed as part of the universal order and purpose.
