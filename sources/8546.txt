The   Twenty Kuan Yin Spiritual Law of Attraction &amp; Mindfulness Teachings   &nbsp;by Hope Bradford

1. You are the physical extension of   your &quot;Authentic&quot; or &quot;Always&quot; Self--that which is the essence of your being

2. &quot;You are god: both the &quot;sliver of   god&quot; and the &quot;ball of light&quot;. Ego's very nature-capable of a relatively   expansive, detailed, and yet individualistic perspective is crucial. Separating   itself out from the God Force, ego extracts infinite unique experiences,   integral to humanity's process of 'spiritualizing matter'. Incarnating on the   earth, achieving individualism is therefore critical for attaining divinity.&quot;

3. You are a creator: &quot;juggler of the   dream and the world of dreams&quot;, Kuan Yin states:

  'You're at page ten but I understand   the entire evolution. In reality, it's already over. It's a dream. Remember?   You're living a dream. It's very complicated to hold the dream and live the   dream. You are learning the art of juggling the dream and the world of dreams.   Nobody really gets hurt'.

4. &quot;You create your whole world from   your thoughts.&quot;

5. You are here on earth in your   &quot;rightful place&quot; because you have chosen it. The laws of reincarnation and karma   are real.

6. The basis of your life is free will   and karma (the personal vibration created from prominent beliefs attracting   objects and events to you). You always have the freedom to change your beliefs   and thus what is attracted: In Her teachings, Kuan Yin states:

'There are the waves and there is the   wind, seen and unseen forces. Everyone has these same elements in their lives,   the seen and unseen: karma and free will. The question is, 'how are you going to   handle what you have?' You are riding the karmic wave underneath and the wind   can shift. Everyone must take what they see and deal with that which is unseen.'

7. The purpose of your life is to marvel   and enjoy all you've created as well as to utilize your &quot;focused intent&quot;; to   &quot;imagine the possibilities of something greater than is right here.&quot;

8. &quot;You are meant to be the 'Watcher'.   Instead of judging, you just see.&quot;

9. &quot;The most powerful forces in the   universe are compassion, loving-kindness and motherly-love.&quot;

10. &quot;You cannot die; you are eternal,   quantum beings.&quot;

11. In the Multiverse, you have infinite   realities to choose from.

12. &quot;The universe will bring whatever   one wants!&quot;

13. &quot;You are made of sound. Sound comes   first in the universe.&quot;

14. &quot;Being in the moment is one's link   to eternity.&quot;

15. &quot;There is no such thing as time.&quot;

16. &quot;There is no evil, only ignorance.&quot;

17. There are new, inexperienced as well   as advanced, compassionate souls on earth.

18. &quot;You are a totally unique, divine   being simultaneously belonging to one huge family, a great continuum.&quot;

19. &quot;You are all sacred energies and   everyone is as sacred as the next.&quot;

20.&nbsp; 'Regard your life as about choices,   experiences and desire and that you are already liberated. Don't be afraid of   desire. It is why you're here: to taste, live.'            Yellow   Lark's prayer

Oh, Great Spirit, whose voice I hear in   the wind,

Whose breath gives life to all the   world.

Hear me; I need your strength and   wisdom.

Let me walk in beauty, and make my eyes   ever behold the red and purple sunset.

Make my hands respect the things you   have made and my ears sharp to hear your voice

Make me wise so that I may understand   the things you have taught my people.

Help me to remain calm and strong in   the face of all that comes towards me.

Let me learn the lessons you have   hidden in every leaf &amp; rock.

I seek strength, not   to be greater than my brother, but to fight my greatest enemy - Myself.

Make me always ready to come to you   with clean hands and straight eyes.

So when life fades, as the falling   sunset, my spirit may come to you without shame.    - Lokota -   Sioux Chief &quot;Yellow Lark&quot; 's prayer&nbsp; in 1887 -

          Wisdom   from a Cherokee Chief    	One evening an old Cherokee told his grandson about   	a battle that goes on inside people. He said, &quot;My son, the battle is between   	2 &quot;wolves&quot; inside us all.    	&nbsp;    	One is Evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow,   	regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies,   	false pride, superiority, and ego.    	&nbsp;    	The other is Good. It is joy, peace, love, hope,   	serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth,   	compassion and faith.&quot;    	&nbsp;    	The grandson thought about it for a minute and then   	asked his grandfather: &quot;Which wolf wins?&quot;    	&nbsp;    	The old Cherokee simply replied, &quot;The one you   	feed.&quot;


          Will   Rogers Sayings
  
  Will Rogers, who died in a plane crash with Wylie   Post in 1935, was probably the greatest political sage this country has ever   known. Enjoy the following: 
  
  
  1. Never slap a man who's chewing tobacco. 
  
  2. Never kick a cow chip on a hot day. 
  
  3. There are 2 theories to arguing with a woman...neither works. 
  
  4. Never miss a good chance to shut up. 
  
  5. Always drink upstream from the herd. 
  
  6. If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. 
  
  7. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it and put it back in your   pocket. 
  
  8. There are three kinds of men: The ones that learn by reading. The few who   learn by observation. The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence and   find out for themselves. 
  
  9. Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad   judgment. 
  
  10. If you're riding' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to   make sure it's still there. 
  
  11. Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier'n puttin' it back. 
  
  12. After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he started   roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him. The moral: When   you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut. 
  
  ABOUT GROWING OLDER...   
  
  First ~ Eventually you will reach a point when you stop lying about your age and   start bragging about it. 
  
  Second ~ The older we get, the fewer things seem worth waiting in line for. 
  
  Third ~ Some people try to turn back their odometers. Not me, I want people to   know &quot;why&quot; I look this way. I've traveled a long way and some of the roads   weren't paved. 
  
  Fourth ~ When you are dissatisfied and would like to go back to youth, think of   Algebra. 
  
  Fifth ~ You know you are getting old when everything either dries up or leaks.  
  
  Sixth ~ I don't know how I got over the hill without getting to the top. 
  
  Seventh ~ One of the many things no one tells you about aging is that it is such   a nice change from being young. 
  
  Eighth ~ One must wait until evening to see how splendid the day has been. 
  
  Ninth ~ Being young is beautiful, but being old is comfortable. 
  
  Tenth ~ Long ago when men cursed and beat the ground with sticks, it was called   witchcraft. Today it's called golf. 
  
  And finally ~ If you don't learn to laugh at trouble, you won't have anything to   laugh at when you are old. 
  
          
  
        Cracked-Pot   Friends        A water bearer in India had two large pots, each hung     on the ends of a pole which he carried across his neck. One of the pots had a     crack in it, while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full     portion of water.      &nbsp;      At the end of the long walk from the stream to the     house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For a full two years this went     on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and a half pots full of water to     his house.      &nbsp;      Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its     accomplishments, perfect for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was     ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish     only half of what it had been made to do.      &nbsp;      After 2 years of what it perceived to be a bitter     failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream. &quot;I am ashamed of     myself, and I want to apologize to you. I have been able to deliver only half     my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way     back to your house. Because of my flaws, you have to do a lot of this work,     and you don't get full value from your efforts,&quot; the pot said.      &nbsp;      The bearer said to the pot, &quot;Did you notice that     there were flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot's     side? That's because I have always known about your flaw, and I planted flower     seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back, you've     watered them.         
    For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the     table. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty     to grace the house.&quot;      &nbsp;      Moral:      &nbsp;      Each of us has our own unique flaws. We're all     cracked pots. But it's the cracks and flaws we each have that make our lives     together so very interesting and rewarding. You've just got to take each     person for what they are, and look for the good in them. Blessed are the     flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape. Remember to appreciate all     the different people in your life!      &nbsp;      THANK YOU ALL - MY CRACKPOT FRIENDS!!        &nbsp;

        Life - Notes from the other   side :), Contributed by Jay Vordal

  The following document was retrieved from   the spirit world. It appears to be a Guide for spirit beings pending a first   time human life experience.

  DESTINATION:   The Planet Earth

  LOCATION:   The Solar System, Second

  Major Planet from the Sun

  First arm of the Milky Way Galaxy,

  The Universe

  In the Mind of 'God.'

  You have chosen and planned a human life   on Earth. Since it will be your first human experience, bear, in mind the   following.

  1 .You will receive only one body; like it   or not, it is yours for the duration. So, take care of it.

  2 You have enrolled in a full time school   called human life. Each day will have lessons for you. It is up to you what you   learn from those lessons. You may not like some lessons or think other lessons   stupid. You may not even recognize many lessons. Still, you chose them - every   one.

  3. Life is a learning process with no   score. You learn as much or more from failure as from success. The only true   failure is not having learned.

  4. Lessons repeat until learned. They take   different forms until they are learned. After learning a lesson, you go onto the   next one. The process does not end.

  5. Wherever you find yourself, whatever   happens, it happens by your choice. You put yourself in situations in order to   learn how to deal with them

  6. You have all the ability you need to   help yourself. You brought it with you. It is up to you to find it within   yourself.

  7. what you experience 'in your human life   you will forget' in following ones, only what you learn stays with you.

  8. Your spirit guides will protect you   from harm not of your own choosing and help you only to the extent you allow

  We hope you achieve your purpose in your   human life and we expect you to return to us a better being for having   experienced it.

       NAIL  IN THE FENCE 
  
   A  Good Story for Great Friends.....Make sure you read all the way down to the last  sentence!
  
  &nbsp;There once was a little girl who had a bad temper.&nbsp; Her mother gave  her a bag of nails and told her that every time she lost her temper, she must  hammer a nail into the back of the fence.
  
  The first day the girl had driven 37 nails into the fence.&nbsp; Over the next  few weeks, as she learned to control her anger, the
  number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. She discovered it was  easier to hold her temper than to drive those nails into the fence.
  
  Finally the day came when the girl didn't lose her temper at all.&nbsp; She told  her mother about it and the mother suggested that
  the girl now pull out one nail for each day that she was able to hold her  temper.&nbsp; The day passed and the young girl was finally able to tell her  mother that all the nails were gone.
  
  The mother took her daughter by the hand and led her to the fence.&nbsp; She  said, &quot;You have done well, my daughter, but look at the holes in the fence.  The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a  scar just like this one.&quot; You can put a knife in a person and draw it out.  It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. A  verbal wound is as bad as a physical one.
  
  Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to  succeed. They lend an ear, they share words of praise and they always want to  open their hearts to us .


   
   $.57 cents
  
  A sobbing little girl stood near  a small church from which she had been turned away because it &quot;was too  crowded.&quot; &quot;I can't go to Sunday School,&quot; she sobbed to the pastor  as he walked by.&nbsp;  Seeing her shabby,  unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason and, taking her by the hand,  took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday school class.&nbsp; The  child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children  who have no place to worship Jesus.
  
  Some two years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor tenement buildings  and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their&nbsp;daughter,  to handle the final arrangements.&nbsp; As her poor little body was being moved,  a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some  trash dump.&nbsp; Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribbled in childish  handwriting, which read, &quot;This is to help build the little church bigger so  more children can go to Sunday School.&quot;
  
  For two years she had saved for this offering of love.&nbsp; When the pastor  tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do.&nbsp;   Carrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the pulpit, he told  the story of her unselfish love and devotion. He &nbsp;&nbsp; challenged  his deacons to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building.
  
  But the story does not end there!
  
  A newspaper learned of the story and published it.&nbsp; It was read by a  Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that  the church could not pay so much, he offered it for 57 cents.  Church  members made large donations.&nbsp; Checks came from far and wide.&nbsp;   Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000.00'a  huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century).&nbsp; Her unselfish love  had paid large dividend.
  
  When you are in the city of        Philadelphia     ,  look up      Temple        Baptist        Church     ,  with a seating capacity of 3,300 and      Temple        University     ,  where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan  Hospital and at a Sunday school building which houses hundreds of Sunday  Scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside during  Sunday school time.
  
  In one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the sweet face  of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved, made such remarkable  history.&nbsp; Alongside of it is a portrait of her kind pastor, Dr. Russell H.  Conwell, author of the book, &quot;Acres of Diamonds.&quot;

    
    &nbsp;    T  H E&nbsp; G A R D E N  - Author unknown at this point, but if you recognize this I'd love to give  you or that person credit!&nbsp; Please speak up.

  HOW TO   STAY YOUNG

  An aging man was walking with his friend.   He said, &quot;I'm a walking economy.&quot;
  &nbsp;
  &quot;How so?&quot; the friend replied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  
  He lamented, &quot;My hair line is in recession, my stomach is a victim of inflation,   and both of these together are putting me into a deep depression!&quot;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can't help but grow older physically, but we can stay   young in other ways. Though I cannot credit the original author, I think the   following piece, sent in by a reader, is worth repeating. Do you want to stay   young?
  
  How to Stay Young
  
  1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the   doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.
  
  2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.
  
  3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever.   Never let the brain idle. &quot;An idle mind is the devil's workshop.&quot; 
  
  4. Enjoy the simple things.&nbsp; When the children are young, that is all that   you can afford. When they are in college, that is all that you can afford. When   you are on retirement, that is all that you can afford!
  
  5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so much   that you can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter.
  
  6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us   our entire life, is ourselves. Be alive while you are alive, don't&nbsp; put out a   mailbox on the highway of death and just wait in residence for your mail.
  
  7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it is family, pets, keepsakes,   music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.
  
  8. Cherish your health. If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve   it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.
  
  9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the mall, the next county, a foreign country,   but not to guilt country.

  10. At every opportunity, tell the people   you love that you love them. 
  
  
    The   Farmer's Donkey....
  
  One day a farmer's donkey fell into an abandoned well.&nbsp; The animal cried   piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he   decided the animal was too old and the well needed to be covered up anyway; so   it just wasn't worth it to him to try to retrieve the donkey.
  &nbsp;

He   invited all his neighbors to come over and help him.&nbsp; They each grabbed a shovel   and began to shovel dirt into the well. Realizing what was happening, the donkey   at first cried and wailed horribly.
  
  Then, a few shovel-fulls later, he quieted down completely.&nbsp; The farmer peered   down into the well, and was astounded by what he saw. With every shovel-full of   dirt that hit his back, the donkey would shake it off and take a step up on the   new layer of dirt.
  &nbsp;

As the   farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake   it off and take a step up.&nbsp; Pretty soon, the donkey stepped up over the edge of   the well and trotted off, to the shock and astonishment of everyone.
  &nbsp;

The   Moral: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all   kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to stop wailing, and not   let the dirt bury you, but to shake it off and take a step up.&nbsp; Each one of our   troubles is a stepping-stone.&nbsp; We can get out of the deepest wells just by not   stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.
  
  &nbsp;

  Remember the five simple rules to be happy:

  Free your heart from hatred. Free your mind from worries.   Live simply. Give more. Expect less.
  
  By the way, after he calmed down, the donkey kicked the crap out of the farmer   who tried to bury him, which brings us to the second moral of this story:   When you try to cover your ass, you will always get your   ass kicked.

  
  
     Wish   for Today
  
   Today...I wish you a day of ordinary   miracles----

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fresh pot of coffee you didn't make yourself.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unexpected phone call from an old friend.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green stoplights on your way to work or shop.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you a day of little things to rejoice in...

&nbsp; &nbsp; The fastest line at the grocery store.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good sing along song on the radio.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your keys right where you look.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you a day of happiness and perfection----
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; little bite-size pieces of perfection that give you the
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; funny feeling that the Lord is smiling on you,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holding you so gently because you are someone
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special and rare.
  
  More Great   Thoughts

To handle yourself, use your head; To handle others,   use your heart. 
  
  Anger is only one letter short of danger. If someone betrays you once, it is his   fault; If he betrays you twice, it is your fault. 
  
  Great minds discuss ideas; Average minds discuss events; Small minds discuss   people. 
  
  He, who loses money, loses much; He, who loses a friend, loses much more; He,   who loses faith, loses all. 
  
  Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, 
  
  Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all   yourself. 
  
  Friends, you and me .... You brought another friend ... And then there were 3   .... We started our group .... Our circle of friends .... There is no beginning   or end ....
  
  NDE Poem -   Here's a beautiful poem by the 13th Century Sufi&nbsp;   named Rumi, who expresses some beautiful truths about the moment of death,   expressing the very thoughts NDE accounts invoke in people who hear them.&nbsp;   Clearly, Rumi knew people who'd had an NDE.&nbsp;   submitted by John Price</font>    

ON THE DAY I DIE  

&nbsp;On the day I die,     when I'm being carried
    toward the grave, don't weep. Don't say,  

he's gone! He's     gone.&nbsp; Death has nothing
    to do with going away.&nbsp; The sun sets and  

the moon sets, but     they're not gone.
    Death is a coming together. The tomb  

looks like a prison,     but it's really
    release into union.&nbsp; The human seed goes  

down in the ground     like a bucket into
    the well where Joseph is.&nbsp; It grows and  

comes up full of some     unimagined beauty.
    Your mouth closes here and immediately  

opens with a shout of     joy there.    
  
  THE TABLECLOTH
  
  The brand new pastor and his wife, newly assigned to their first ministry, to reopen a church in suburban Brooklyn, arrived in early October excited about their opportunities.
  
  When they saw their church, it was very run down and needed much work. They set a goal to have everything done in time to have their first service on Christmas Eve.
  
  They worked hard, repairing pews, plastering walls, painting, etc., and on December 18 were ahead of schedule and just about finished.
  
  On December 19 a terrible tempest - a driving rainstorm hit the area and lasted for two days.
  
  On the 21st, the pastor went over to the church. His heart sank when he saw that the roof had leaked, causing a large area of plaster about 20 feet by 8 feet to fall off the front wall of the sanctuary just behind the pulpit, beginning about head high.
  
  The pastor cleaned up the mess on the floor, and not knowing what else to do but postpone the Christmas Eve service, headed home. On the way he noticed that a local business was having a flea market type sale for charity so he stopped in. One of the items was a beautiful, handmade, ivory colored, crocheted tablecloth with exquisite work, fine colors and a Cross embroidered right in the center. It was just the right size to cover up the hole in   the front wall. He bought it and headed back to the church.
  
  By this time it had started to snow. An older woman running from the opposite direction was trying to catch the bus. She missed it. The pastor invited her to wait in the warm church for the next bus 45 minutes later.
  
  
  She sat in a pew and paid no attention to the pastor while he got a ladder, hangers, etc., to put up the tablecloth as a wall tapestry. The pastor could hardly believe how beautiful it looked and it covered up the entire problem area.
  
  Then he noticed the woman walking down the center aisle. Her face was like a sheet.. &quot;Pastor,&quot; she asked, &quot;where did you get that tablecloth?&quot; The pastor explained. The woman asked him to check the lower right corner to see if the initials, EBG were crocheted into it there. They were. These were the initials of the woman, and she had made this tablecloth 35 years before, in Austria.
  
  The woman could hardly believe it as the pastor told how he had just gotten the Tablecloth. The woman explained that before the war she and her husband were well-to-do people in Austria. When the Nazis came, she was forced to leave. Her husband was going to follow her the next week. She was captured, sent to prison and never saw her husband or her home again.
  
  The pastor wanted to give her the tablecloth; but she made the pastor keep it for the church. The pastor insisted on driving her home, that was the least he could do.. She lived on the other side of Staten Island and was only in Brooklyn for the day for a housecleaning job.
  
  What a wonderful service they had on Christmas Eve. The church was almost full. The music and the spirit were great. At the end of the service, the pastor and his wife greeted everyone at the door and many said that they would return.
  
  One older man, whom the pastor recognized from the neighborhood, continued to sit in one of the pews and stare, and the pastor wondered why he wasn't leaving.
  
  The man asked him where he got the tablecloth on the front wall because it was identical to one that his wife had made years ago when they lived in Austria before the war and how could there be two tablecloths so much alike.
  
  He told the pastor how the Nazis came, how he forced his wife to flee for her safety, and he was supposed to follow her, but he was arrested and put in a prison.. He never saw his wife or his home again all the 35 years in between.
  
  The pastor asked him if he would allow him to take him for a little ride. They drove to Staten Island and to the same house where the pastor had taken the woman three days earlier.
  
  He helped the man climb the three flights of stairs to the woman's apartment knocked on the door and he saw the greatest Christmas reunion he could ever imagine.
  
  True Story - submitted by Pastor Rob Reid
  
  Who says God does not work in mysterious ways..
  
  I asked the Lord to bless you as I prayed for you today. To guide you and protect you as you go along your way. His love is always with you, His promises are true, and when we give Him all our cares you know He will see us through. So when the road you're traveling on seems difficult at best.. Just remember I'm here praying and God will do the rest.
