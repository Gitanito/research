I remember seeing its headlights coming towards us. I was talking on the phone with my mom at the time and we were arguing about something. I just felt really still for a minute, then I saw a long dark tunnel with a light at the end and I walked through it. I saw my body in the car and felt my sister tug on my hair saying, ‘Kristy, don't leave me. I need you.’ So, I returned. I did not want to leave. I went back into my body and my eyes did not feel like my eyes any more, they felt ‘different’ (I have been legally blind since birth). I went to the emergency room and just wanted to sleep. The doctor said I had a mild concussion and a broken collar bone.
