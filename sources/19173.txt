everybody seen this this have been all
over the news this is what we call the
atacoma
humanoid um first of all I don&#39;t know
what it is every scientist has looked
that it says oh my God it looks like an
alien well perhaps we don&#39;t know it&#39;s a
mystery it&#39;s an enigma wrapped in a
mystery it may be something
prosaic but I don&#39;t believe
so it&#39;s actually interesting I have not
had a person who I&#39;ve shown the things
to who hasn&#39;t been absolutely fascinated
oh I know right and but it&#39;s only when
you want to talk about it slightly
openly that suddenly everybody shuts
down hey Tom if it is something
interesting right let&#39;s say in the most
interesting of all uh ways from a
clinical standpoint it&#39;s a human
mutation right one of the things that
could has to be answered because just a
preliminary examination of this sample
is that it is obviously older than just
an aborted fetus right so preliminary
examination tells you that this is uh a
small human perhaps right that has lived
post birth for for a sufficiently long
period of time that how do you explain
how something 6 in
tall survived to any length of time uh
that would uh allow for it to survive
100 or a thousand years ago in the most
interesting and outrageous case uh it is
something that is not human and not uh
primate but still
hominid how do we explain a hominid that
small so the answer answer is before we
get too excited uh and spend too much
time speculating is let&#39;s just use the
techniques that we use in the laboratory
every single day to answer the
question so luckily uh here at Stanford
we happen to have literally the world&#39;s
expert the man who wrote the book on
bone dysplasias and syndromes a
gentleman by the name of Dr Ralph
lochman we went to Barcelona where this
little be is stored we took exact x-ray
that he requested from
Stanford and brought them back hand
carried them back as well as on a
computerized disc which is now on our
website you can see it he looked at it
and he said well first of all there is
no form of
dwarfism or genetic defect that explains
everything seen in this
being so one of the first things that Dr
lochman uh immediately remarked upon was
the shape of the head and the skull
uh that uh it was not something that he
is accustomed to seeing certain aspects
of the skull and certain aspects of the
potential mutations and syndromes that
might account for the specimen uh were
uh were present but what was remarkable
at least in my discussions uh with him
that any s any given syndrome often has
uh co- phenotypes or co- events that
would occur and it was quite interesting
interesting uh and in some ways exciting
as he would uh remark upon a particular
uh feature of the specimen and then find
that the associated features that you
would expect from a syndrome of that
nature were not found what you&#39;ll also
see is that he says it has 10 ribs
occasionally there are uh human
mutations where there&#39;s perhaps 11 uh
ribs but only rarely is it ever seen
that there is 10 and then never are
those kinds of mutations seen ass
associated with the other features of
the of the skull and or face so again if
this is human uh and it it has a
constellation of mutations that have not
been seen before uh doesn&#39;t discount
that it might be such a constellation of
mutations but it&#39;s just that they&#39;ve
never been seen before what he didn&#39;t
notice but I will point it out to you it
has four skull bones where rather than
the six major Ms we have it&#39;s
symmetrical and the Symmetry is what&#39;s
also very important only asymmetry tree
I want to point out uh which which is
mentioned in Dr lachman&#39;s report is the
fact that it had a terrible blow to what
we would call our right mastoid air cell
area of the skull that crushed the skull
and kind of torqued the whole skull and
also a fracture of the right
humorus the epipal plates if you look at
the
X-ray which is the growth plates you
know when you have you know the growth
plates in a kid kid and they they hurt
their leg the growth plates and the bone
density is that of a 6 to 8ye Old the
idea here is that uh in the growing knee
or in the growing joint uh mostly it is
made of cartilage uh and that you get a
mineralization of the cartilage uh and a
continued growth of this uh so-called
growth plate there are standards right
there are expectations that uh you will
have the uh growth plate uh be of a
certain size for a certain age the the
shock I think uh and the surprise was
and the and the absolute certainty that
uh Dr lochman had was that this specimen
was clearly not fetal right uh even
though the size of the specimen would
would suggest that it&#39;s it&#39;s fetal but
that by comparing the growth plates uh
to known standards this is clearly
between 6 to 8 years old
all right now call me crazy but I&#39;m just
a doctor but I can tell you I&#39;ve taken
care of a lot of children that are six
and 8 year olds I&#39;ve never seen one 6 in
tall this is 6 in 13 cm what 6 to 8y old
can live to
be only 6 in tall number one number two
how did it live it was found in the
driest place on Earth the Atacama Desert
in Chile Northern
Chile it is estimated to be in in many
decades and probably hundreds of years
old there was no neonato Intensive Care
Unit in Chile at that time there may not
be now and even at the best neonatal
Intensive Care Unit in the world today
you could not keep
this person for La a better word
alive so the question becomes what is it
it&#39;s quite clear that this is uh a real
sample this is a a real specimen this is
not something somebody glued together
anybody who thinks that this is
something that is glued together I
challenge them to do it right and I
challenge them to be able to subject
such a thing to an x-ray and or CRT
image and then let that pass the world&#39;s
expert in bone dysplasias right so that
has not been done since it doesn&#39;t
conform to any known form of dwarfism it
could very possibly be a type of
Progeria which is when you have a a very
Advanced a aging process but he
seriously doubted it now fast forward to
some of the early work now this has been
misinterpreted in the internet
unfortunately not only on The Huffington
Post um but also in in a number of other
minor news outlets about the genetic
report I want to be very careful number
one keep this number in mind a
neanderthal is 99.5% genetically
identical to everyone in this room
okay the chimpanzee and the great apes
96 to 97 or more per identical
genetically this being has a big match
to Human Genome but it&#39;s an upright
creature with a very large cranial Vault
three times the size of our cranial
Vault from the eyes
up so we would expect a lot of the
operative genes it was if it was in this
3D dimension and it&#39;s a humanoid to have
some match
what&#39;s unusual although nothing can be
concluded yet from it is that
9% of the genetic material is quote
unmatching now this is on a computerized
run at the best lab in the world at of
Stanford and and it was checked three
times
9% now is that all computer read error
maybe is it all what&#39;s called DNA junk
perhaps we don&#39;t know it&#39;s going to take
years to go through what the computer
kicked out into the trash can of
unmatched DNA to figure out what is in
there Dr Nolan the Stanford head of the
team doesn&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what we
know is this it&#39;s going to take years
and at least if we&#39;re lucky a year or
two to go through that because it&#39;s two
million base pairs of genetic material
unmatched now if you were dealing with
my DNA or
yours and you had a lot of unmatching
you just leave it alone because we know
we&#39;re just humans and it&#39;s just like
well it was a computer error or it this
or that but when you have something that
looks like
that what you have is something that
cannot just be tossed away because so
far and this is something I want you to
listen to extremely
carefully the gene that control for
Progeria Advanced aging or dwarfism are
showing no
mutations this is a 6 in 68y
Old get it those why isn&#39;t there
something in there so this is still a
mystery now once the geneticists say
human use the word
human the media that aren&#39;t well-versed
in genetic research said oh well case
closed case is just
starting it has just begun and I can
tell you that it may be years before we
get an answer on this we have to do
probably a year or two or three of
research and I&#39;ll remind people that the
Human Genome Project cost billions of
dollars and took 10 years and thousands
of scientists we&#39;re just going into
something that&#39;s basically an
unknown and the other thing that&#39;s come
to light is that there may be more of
these we&#39;re on the the lead to one that
may exist and have been found in Puerto
Rico there are reports that there are
more of these that are in uh Chile and
we have videotapes and photographs of a
creature that looks very similar to this
one that was a little more mature maybe
less than a foot tall that was uh found
in Russia uh was kept alive for a number
of of months apparently I found out
about it in 1996 but too late the FSB
which took the place of the KGB had
apparently confiscated it by then
so we have to be very careful I&#39;m not
saying it&#39;s ET I&#39;m saying we don&#39;t know
but looking at the big clinical picture
it just cannot just be a normal defected
human if it lived to be 6 to8 years of
age and it&#39;s only 6 Ines tall the point
is there&#39;s a great deal of mysterious
information around this and we have to
be very careful to Proclaim it one thing
or another people are proclaiming it ET
I&#39;m saying we don&#39;t know quite what it
is other people are saying ah we solved
the mystery because it has so much human
DNA in it no we&#39;re not saying that
either because there&#39;s still this 9%
unmatch which could be everything from
computer read error to junk DNA to where
the mystery of how this thing existed
well I mean no matter what I mean if
you&#39;re a scientist and in the biologies
yeah if this is we know this is an
organism it&#39;s not matched up to any
primate right any ancient common any
modern primate any thing that is known
so it&#39;s it&#39;s an unknown so that&#39;s what
Discovery is about and so you know the
point I make to people is that so let it
go where it goes and right follow the
science where it takes you and so
there&#39;s a great deal of research that
has to be done uh an expedition to do
this properly would cost probably 10
times what it cost to do this
documentary and we if some anyone wants
to underwrite that I&#39;ll be there with
bills on follow on to this after you do
the genetic analysis is an expedition to
the atacoma desert to further right do
um investigations into this region and
uh because of reports that there are
more than one of these M and if if if a
second one were to be found that would
be right well if there&#39;s a second one uh
then I
think all bets are
off
that
