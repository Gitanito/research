  		              		Experience Description   

    I had taken an overdose of pills and then laid down to sleep. 

  The next thing I remember was being stood in a forest. It was the middle of the day and it was really sunny. A voice told me to walk into the trees and my soul would leave my body. I hesitated and the voice  said, 'You're not ready. You can't come yet.' I tried to walk to the trees,  but nothing happened. 

Then, I was back in my physical body and vomiting everything out of my system. I suffered hallucinations.  I couldn't speak and couldn't walk.  Also, my limbs would not stop shaking and jerking for hours after that.  I know that if I hadn't thrown up, I would have died.
