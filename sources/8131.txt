  		              		Experience Description   

    It was just after dinner. I had been thinking about suicide for weeks because I was not able to find a job. I was feeling down about myself for not contributing to my family. So,  I took some pills  to end it all.     I was unconscious and in the hospital for five days.    

  I remember  floating in a void. I could see  a little box or window to the physical world. It was a distance away, but I could see my mom  sitting to the left of the hospital bed. There were two doctors to the right of my body. I felt peaceful, despite  nothing but darkness around me. Yet  I didn't feel like I was alone. I don't know how long I was there, but I did have a  choice whether  I was going to live or die. I could hear myself thinking that I needed  to come back to my body.  

  I returned to see  the surprised look on the doctors faces, like I wasn't supposed to be there right now. I came back feeling a whole lot better like nothing happened. It was a wild experience that changed me forever. I will never forget that experience. My faith in God became deeper. I no longer fear death and freely live life. Even thought life is tough, it is not worth taking your life.   I still wonder  what would have  happened if I  had chosen to stay there.
