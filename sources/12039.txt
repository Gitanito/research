  		              		Experience Description   

    I am an army brat and my parents were stationed in Germany.  My father was away on a training mission and my mother was a stay-at-home parent.  We lived in military housing, which was a apartment building. The neighbor across the hall had asked my mom to babysit her baby and she had dropped the baby and baby's diaper bag off at the apartment.  Unbeknownst to my mother, the lady had poured two containers of orange-flavored baby aspirin into one container, and then put the container in a small brown paper sack and tucked into the diaper bag. When my mom was in the kitchen fixing a bottle for the baby, I sneaked into the diaper bag and found the container of hidden aspirin. I ate them all.  Needless to say, later while watching cartoons, my eyes rolled back and I went into convulsions.  My mother screamed for help and I was transported to the hospital.  The lady with the baby saw that the aspirin was missing. She  contacted the hospital to inform them of our arrival and about the missing aspirin.  Too much time had passed and the aspirin was already in my bloodstream. By the time we made it to the hospital, I was limp and  lifeless in my mother's arms.  
  
  The medical personal rushed me into a room where they started trying to revive me.  As they worked on me, I left my body and was watching from above.  I could see and hear everything, but could not feel what they were doing to the body below.  I can remember vividly watching with curiosity and interest.  While watching the doctors and nurses working on the body below, I also remember being able to watch what was happening at the same time in the room they had taken my mom.  I could feel my mother's hysteria and distraught, as if her emotions were my own. I remember being overwhelmed with feelings of intense love for my mother. I had memories of a past life that I had shared before this one that involved both my mother and my sister.

   I also experienced a knowing of my mother's future through two separate scenarios: One if I decided to leave this life, and one if I decided to stay. The knowing felt like a gift being given and even though I had a 3-year-old mentality I was able to receive this information as if I was a mature person. I cannot relate how much time passed, but I remember making a decision. Once I did this, I felt myself pulled back into the body I had been watching below me. 

Immediately, I felt everything being done to me. Because this happened when I was 3 all the details other than the ones described is all I can remember.

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1963

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes  Accident.  Drug or medication overdose.  CPR given.     Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   The event occurred due to an overdose of baby aspirin (two fatal doses) a combination of two bottles that had been combined into one large container.  
  
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing  

The experience included:      Out of body experience  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  Everything that was occurring in the location my body was and also the location where they had taken my mom I witnessed and heard.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I answered this question as more because of the knowledge, knowing, and understanding I received during this experience.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I am unsure how to interpret this question but I would have to say throughout my experience, I felt alert to all that was going on. My highest level of physical consciousness if I were to take this question literally would be when I returned to my body. My experience was vivid.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I felt almost as if I split into two when I left my body because I was able to witness two locations at the same time but can remember each in it's own distinct way.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Since the occurrence happened when I was 3, I really can't answer this question other than saying I don't remember a difference.  
  
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I could hear things said and I could hear things thought. That's the only way I can explain it.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an Unearthly light?         Uncertain   

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     While I was outside my body I felt like I was in a different dimension but still connected to the dimension I was witnessing.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I felt the emotions mostly of my mother's distraught and also of her motherly love.

The experience included:       Special knowledge or purpose  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     I had a more mature understanding of things past, present, and future.  

The experience included:       Life Review  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events     I became aware of other past lives.  

The experience included:       Future Visions  

  Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future.     I was shown that I would experience other trauma and tragedies, but also that there was a reason I would have to overcome and learn from these experiences. I was also shown times of accomplishment, purpose, and that there is a reason for everything.  
  
  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   My decision was based on emotions and a purpose of life that I witnessed and had an immense sense of knowing about. I felt a sense of importance and was reminded that I would recognize it once it occurred in the future.

Yes     I have clairvoyant abilities, see spirits, and have what I describe as a hitchhiker attachment I feel came back with me to this life when I was out of my body in the other dimension.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes I chose to stay here in this life because of my mom and my mom confirmed that she also did the same for me when she had a near death experience before she passed 3 years later.

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Not really. It pretty much covers it all.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         No. I do feel some of the questions were too repetitive and because of this it took quite some time to complete the questionnaire.
