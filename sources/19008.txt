all right i would like to
thank all of you for coming this
afternoon here in boulder it is
june 23 2018 uh just for the record
and we&#39;re going to take a quick trip
through the cosmology
and then a deep dive into
what our folks at the cia called wsfm
not a radio station it stands for weird
science and freaking magic
all the classified technologies where
they&#39;re located
when they were developed how they&#39;ve
been deployed etc and so on
so i&#39;d like to thank first some folks
who&#39;ve made this
possible university called the colorado
school
here at wolf law school which has
provided the facility
uh neil for his webinar help lira and
ricky
and marcel and grant all the folks out
front who are our volunteers thank
you all for making this happen
and a big thank you all for coming here
in person spend your saturday afternoon
with us
i would like to start
by saying that give you a little bit of
context
of why i&#39;m doing these last few
webinars and seminars there&#39;s a need
at this point for me to do a
brain dump for lack of a better word out
into the public domain
ahead of some things that the public
needs to know
these are some of these or subjects that
i&#39;ve talked about
peripherally but i think it needs to go
into in more depth
to understand where this knowledge has
come from
many of you have seen the disclosure
project witnesses
and there will be parts of this
information scattered throughout their
testimony
but i&#39;m trying to pull it together into
a three-hour condensed
package so you kind of get your minds
around it
keep in mind that only one in ten
disclosure project
military intelligence and corporate
witnesses
about one in ten have been willing to go
on videotape and be
identified to the public 90
do not want to be there are some recent
ones
since the movie unacknowledged came out
that have surfaced
that are really the most important
yet uh and most current who have been in
certain unacknowledged special access
projects which are the deep black
projects that&#39;s the proper name that&#39;s
where the title came from unacknowledged
and i want to put together for all of
you
today an understanding of the cosmology
that&#39;s gotten very mixed up in the ufo
subculture
with the knowledge that i&#39;ve gained
since 1990
uh having been dealing with various
people in the intelligence community
which i will call ic from here on and
military and corporate world who have
worked
in this space dealing with
extraterrestrial technology
zero point energy extraordinary
electromagnetic field
propulsion and communication systems etc
there&#39;s over 950
of these top secret sources that i have
now
and we started out with about a dozen
and by the disclosure project we had a
few hundred about 70
80 came forward on videotape it&#39;s now 10
times that
and with that has been some frustration
for me and i want to share it with you
because in an ideal world
all of those people would come forward
name rank and serial number
but we don&#39;t live in an ideal world and
as a physician
i respect the confidential information
that people give me
so if it&#39;s confidential and they ask
that i keep their
name and identity confidential i keep it
confidential
that however puts me in a very bad
position because i&#39;m walking around in
my little random access memory
uh with 28 years of information from
about a thousand of these people and
that&#39;s hard
really hard you know you just go ah how
do i get this out to the public
so what i&#39;m trying to do today and in
the next few uh
uh webinars that i&#39;ll do over the next
six months or so
is to provide as much of that
information to the public
uh as as we can and i think it&#39;s
important for people to appreciate that
we&#39;re not i&#39;m not in a position to to
force anyone to identify themselves
what i will try to do is give you their
provenance
what command they were in the kinds of
information
they were read into read into means
briefed and military speak
and how i came about that when
appropriate
in general i think it&#39;s more important
to focus on the knowledge and the
information than this
than the source per se i don&#39;t repeat
things from
questionable sources i question
you know everyone they have to provide
me proof that they were in the command
they have to give me their badges send
them to me sometimes physically send
them to me
if it&#39;s a classified badge
and i have to see this so that&#39;s what i
rely on
and that&#39;s why the disclosure project
has been and is the gold standard for
people
all over the world for finding out about
this
issue that&#39;s really what i want to share
and it&#39;s from those sorts of
sources and methods as they say in the
intelligence community
but before we can even get into that
we have to start with something more
fundamental
and that is what is this
thing called reality that we live in the
cosmos
and i know this sounds like well what
what does that have to do with these
unacknowledged special access projects
and their technologies and facilities
everything because if you don&#39;t
understand what&#39;s sitting in front of
you on the screen right here
there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to
understand the kinds of technologies
we&#39;re going to cross over into
very quickly today so first i want to go
through this concept
of everyone knows about the conventional
universe
3d 4d if you call consider
time a dimension some who some don&#39;t
it&#39;s the material universe space-time
matter
light and dark matter dark energy etc
and so on
that&#39;s what astrophysicists star systems
galaxies
subatomic particles conventional physics
and conventional
understanding then there&#39;s the conscious
universe
and there are other dimensions connected
to the conscious universe
and you see where i&#39;ve done sort of an
overlap
so we have a physical body but we&#39;re
conscious and we can be aware of
awareness
and because we can become aware of
awareness
we can remote view we can
see the future see the past
and of course the masters and rishis of
old could teleport
materialize dematerialize etc
so all conscious higher intelligent life
forms
have the ability to
manifest
that&#39;s a strange sound like from that
horror movie
it have the ability
have the ability to do
affect the physical cause world and the
physical cosmos
in ways that interstellar
trans-dimensional
extraterrestrial civilization can this
is lesson number one
it&#39;s a hard lesson it&#39;s a really deep
one
so if you can imagine all the stories
you&#39;ve heard of the
masters of old or even
people in the modern era who have
levitated well you can do a
levitation mass cancellation so-called
anti-gravity
through resonant field electromagnetic
systems
now let&#39;s talk about remote viewing
everybody&#39;s heard of remote viewing cie
programs darpa
dia i know a lot of these guys
well that&#39;s the ability to be a seer and
use consciousness to see something at a
remote
distance or a remote point in space-time
but that can be done through
augmentation using electromagnetic
systems
which is what interstellar civilizations
have and
covert programs have this is the part
that you&#39;re not going to hear
and see in hollywood that&#39;s what you&#39;re
going to hear about today so
you&#39;ll see that i put that
extraterrestrial civilizations all of
them that are higher intelligent
sentient life forms that&#39;s how i&#39;m
defining this they&#39;re capable of being
aware of awareness
and humans and then there&#39;s this
subsection here
covert technologies that are augmented
by the study of et systems and
trans-dimensional stagecraft
these are the ones that are going to be
a big deep dive
in a few moments you understand
because it isn&#39;t just everyone thinks
that the secret technologies have to do
with lockheed martin and northrop&#39;s and
boeing&#39;s
anti-gravity black triangles and
flying saucers and things like that
which they do have and have had since
the 50s
perhaps a little sooner in terms of
prototypes a little earlier
however this part has not been looked at
by the public and this is what i want to
pull the curtain back
because there&#39;s a a phenom what i call a
strange phenomenon going on where you
have
sort of a wizard of oz behind the
curtain
pulling strings and levers scaling the
shoe scaring the hell out of people
with stuff that looks other dimensional
and looks extraterrestrial but is being
run
from an unacknowledged special access
project and i know who they are
where they&#39;re operating from what their
technologies are and what their modus
operandi is
that you need to know you need to know
it 50 years ago
when they at with advent of those so
that is why this is its own on this
we&#39;ll see a later slide now in the other
conscious dimensions
we&#39;ll take a quick trip through these
probably everyone in this room
if it was a physics class they&#39;d be
going
but everyone in this room presumably
knows what this
is but let&#39;s relate let&#39;s pretend
there&#39;s someone here from the school
of physics you&#39;re conscious and awake
you go to sleep at night you awaken in a
lucid
dream where you&#39;re flying
and that dream ends up being
precognitive you see
something that happens the next day or
the next week or the next year
this is a lucid precognitive dream how
many people have had one at some point
in their life
very large percentage of this audience
most humans have
although most scientists won&#39;t admit to
it because they don&#39;t want to be
discredited
i on the other hand as a medical doctor
didn&#39;t care what people thought
i said you know if you don&#39;t believe it
fine [ __ ] off
anyway
charming okay so that
that is actually an activation of the
astral cosmos
and an interface between yourself and
the so-called spirit world
and during such an experience you may
have
an encounter with an ancestral being
someone who was on this planet before
you it could have been a grandmother or
grandfather
my great aunt who i was very close to
visited me the day she passed away
and came into my room that night and i
saw her as a 30 or 40 year old beautiful
and then she went off and she said
goodbye to me that way that was a very
real experience i didn&#39;t even know she
had passed away
i found out the next day that is a very
real experience
and then there are other consciousness
that are
entities that are not human but not e.t
all right this is the part that gets
everyone
stumbled
and these are are beings
that reside in other
conscious dimensions and other
dimensions
that are not physical planets with
physical star systems
with material bodies but they&#39;re
conscious
they&#39;re living they&#39;re thinking they&#39;re
volitional they have will
and they can push into an interface
with this dimension under certain
conditions and those are strictly
speaking
interdimensional beings of different
kinds
and some have had experiences with what
they would call
very high angelic like beings
others have had experiences with some
very rather unfriendly entities
and what have you and so those are
absolutely real
and they can be quantified in some of
the classified labs and in fact
their technologies that exist in very
advanced laboratories can
tap into those dimensions and bring them
into this dimension there&#39;s such a
project going on right now in salt lake
city
so i think that what you have to
understand is that these
other dimensional realms have beings
that are neither human
nor extraterrestrial as you would think
of extraterrestrial
meaning someone from another star system
from another planet with a
spacecraft and it&#39;s traveling across the
distances
of of space-time using advanced
technological systems
but as they do so here&#39;s the confusion
there&#39;s an intersection
they are crossing into the ets that are
in this material cosmos have
technologies
that look like this
they look like that what do i mean
you&#39;re not going to take an object and
accelerate this to the speed of light
and beyond
to go from the andromeda galaxy to here
this two and a half million light years
away
why because in this
form as it would approach
light speed it would take on infinite
mass
therefore you employ a type of physic
resonant field
high frequency physics where this
all the elements within it subatomic
atomic molecular
resonantly this if you understand spin
theory won&#39;t get into too much of the
physics of this
tilts it out of this dimension into the
let&#39;s call it near astral
this the interface between this
and the astral between your body and the
astral
there&#39;s an interface there&#39;s a layer
that you can slip along
and that&#39;s how you go from one star
system to another and
i&#39;m dropping a very big secret here
because this is why people will see an
extraterrestrial vehicle
and it&#39;ll vanish in front of their eyes
people say oh it cloaked itself
didn&#39;t just cloak itself you could walk
straight through it
it has shifted out of this dimension
just enough tilting let&#39;s take the spin
and angular momentum of the
subatomic and molecular structure of
that craft and everyone on board
a little bit out of this fixed linear
space-time
so that it can appear to disappear
and de-materialize and then boom it pops
on
over the outback of australia a
nanosecond later
or instantaneously or it simply
bilocates
we&#39;ll get into this again one of the
vedic cities
of the ancient vedas cities or the
powers and abilities and consciousness
that developed
is by location trilocation
dematerialization
levitation solid objects going through
another solid object
all of those cities that can be
developed siddhis
are abilities that are innately within
every human being but also every
extraterrestrial
but they can become routinized or
scientifically applied
by civilizations advanced enough in
their science
and technology does this make sense
so here&#39;s where you get a big confusion
because there are a lot of people having
experiences with these
and even beings that are not even in the
astral but in the
pure thought realm and they will think
it&#39;s extraterrestrial because they know
it&#39;s not human
guess what it&#39;s neither and so there
has to be this discernment because in
the ufo space
there are a lot of different phenomena
plural
being described as one phenomenon big
mistake
that is the first fundamental mistake
of the ufo studies area and it needs to
be corrected
because it&#39;s being exploited by the
intelligence community
to fool everybody this is where i&#39;m
going with this does this make sense
yet or i lost anyone okay this is sort
of your sort of introductory thing about
the cosmology here
the reason you know understanding this
seems really arcane but let me give you
a couple examples which
besides the lucid precognitive dream
let&#39;s say
i&#39;ll give you an example of a lockheed
martin skunkworks guy
now here&#39;s a little interesting story
a lot of these military witnesses it&#39;s
kind of transactional
i hate to use that term they come to me
to give me
information because they want to pick my
brain about stuff they don&#39;t understand
does that make sense okay but it&#39;s fine
i&#39;m happy to teach
the word dr dosier from the latin means
to teach so there you are
um so this one man approached me
and don phillips blockhead skunk works
and he was just going to be a military
and skunk works witness
dealing with a radar case of these
objects at a
skunkworks facility where he was working
and you can read his testimony in
the book and also on our youtube site
which is youtube.com
slash s disclosure as in
sirius disclosure s disclosure dot so
that
has about 70 of these top secret
military witnesses up there for anyone
to see who wants to take the time to
look at all of it
but one of the reasons he contacted me
he told me the stories that i&#39;m happy to
be a witness to this
it happened ages ago in the 60s or
something
but i really want to know something
and ex have explained to me something
that i&#39;ve never understood
because back many years ago he was
studying to be a voice secretion
and he was going through some training
program to do
what&#39;s called astral projection you know
i&#39;ve never taken the course but
apparently they&#39;re trying to go from
their physical body
and then go out with their astral body
and
under volition have a controlled sort of
journey
and he was really studying this hard and
finally one day his teacher came in and
said look
don you&#39;re ready to do this you&#39;re just
mentally intellectually
you know hung up on it just let go relax
go lay down on your bed and
do it and just intend that you can do it
which is a really key point to
meditation and doing the cities
you just intend that you can as if you
can and you do
right okay so he did it and sure enough
boom he launched up out of his body
but he as he called it an uncontrolled
launch went up through the ceiling of
his house
and the roof of his house into the
atmosphere
and he went up to and slammed
into an extraterrestrial vehicle
that was up in high orbit
that you know and he recognized
instantly what it was now
anyone who&#39;s had a lucid dream or an out
of body experience
you know that what you see is even more
real than this looks here it&#39;s like this
hyper reality
you know it&#39;s beautiful and that&#39;s what
you experience in your near-death
experiences as well
and but in his case
here was this e.t craft and it was up
in the atmosphere but he says i don&#39;t
understand i wasn&#39;t in my
physical body
i wasn&#39;t in this but when i
hit the craft it moved
and he said i should have just gone
right through it but how could the
density of my
astral energy light body affect the e.t
craft this way i said ah because they
were of like density
the e.t craft if anyone was looking up
in the sky would not have been visible
it would have been shifted into the
quote near astral
and there was enough similarity of the
resonant frequency of that
astral body that you launched out into
the sky with
and that e.t vehicle that was shifted
just out of
3d and 4d but was hovering there they
don&#39;t have to be traveling that way they
can just hover
you won&#39;t even see them you have to
sense them
and he did tell a funny story he said
well it was really kind of embarrassing
because i
popped into the inside of this craft and
there were these et&#39;s at a console that
looked at me like my god why don&#39;t you
watch where you&#39;re going
and you clumsy
cosmic traveler and uh
he was actually quite embarrassed by it
i said yeah it was an interplanetary
diplomatic faux pas you don&#39;t just
barge in
now that&#39;s a really true story he didn&#39;t
understand
this he did he under i mean he was a
scientist
and he was also someone who had worked
in a lot of classified projects and he
understood
the human experience of the
spirit world let&#39;s call it in the astral
body and near-death experiences and
things like this but he did not
understand
why the extraterrestrial vehicle
would have been affected by his astral
body that way
and actually bumped and moved and i said
well
because at that point it was shifted
into an energy form that was
very similar to the density the
quantifiable and it is quantifiable
density of your spirit body your astral
body
he says oh that makes sense i said yeah
it&#39;s actually
not hard to figure this out once you
understand this
if you understand the entirety of all
that exists
is consciousness shifting and phasing
in different densities and that includes
this podium
and everything everything is conscious
and everything is consciousness
phasing in a different way
now luckily before i was a meditation
teacher i became a
i mean before i was a doctor i became a
meditation teacher with marion and jeff
creamer who were here from
the local area 44 years ago we met out
at
miu and became meditation teachers
together
and my misspent youth it was
it was awesome and
it was very good that i did that before
i went into medicine and all of this
because it laid a foundation
for me to understand what is
the reality not only of the human
condition
the deep spiritual cosmic level of human
potential but also of space and time
which is also conscious
the entire cosmos is a conscious
hologram that is
awake and everything in it
now the civilizations that have figured
out how to go from one star system to
another
have mastered the science of
consciousness very well
and they understand that and then they
can develop technologies where it
interfaces
with say communication systems
so that they have a little black box no
it&#39;s not an apple
iphone but it&#39;ll be a little thing and
they can think to it
and it transmits the information thought
to thought person to person so you say
well couldn&#39;t you do that
telepathically yes you can but there&#39;s a
factor of error there
whereas if it can be done scientifically
and precisely
then you develop that capability which
is what they have
but it also means they have those
technologies that cross over into the
propulsion systems
teleportation systems materialization
dematerialization etc
these are all the things that began to
be drilled down on
hard between the early 20th century
and today so about a hundred years of
classified research
we&#39;re gonna get into this
therefore if it sounds confusing to you
it&#39;s only because
you have to stop for a moment and think
what is within me i have a physical body
i&#39;m in this physical room
on a physical planet going around a
physical star
but i also have within me my body of
light
the essence of my reality
the causation the thought being
the tone within yourself there is
actually a resonant tone like a mantra
but it&#39;s unique to every
thing in creation that is like a
standing wave
that manifests and it&#39;s called the
thought sound component of thought
is what a mantra is and then deep within
us
is this transcendent level of
consciousness and we&#39;re all
part and parcel of that field and that&#39;s
why there is no separation
in space and time once you understand
that every point in space and time and
all matter
this is where entanglement theory and
what einstein called the spooky effect
where you know he observed that
something in one place was
affecting another place instantaneously
and it got spooky
but that&#39;s what non-locality in physics
is
right you&#39;ve all heard of non-locality
this is the ultimate non-locality it&#39;s
this state of transcendent consciousness
which fyi is folded within every single
one of you
what the samadhi state is is what you
sit and you meditate and you enter into
that
and sometimes you get it clearly
sometimes you don&#39;t but that&#39;s what the
meditative process
can lead to and some people call that
awakening or enlightenment or what have
you
it&#39;s really the ordinary state of
consciousness you are always
that whether you recognize it or not
that&#39;s the beauty of this now your
individual ego may not recognize it or
even understand it
but then phenomena happens like
intuition
precognition lucid dreams
etc and so on and miraculous things
where you hear about people who
suddenly are able to pick up or almost
levitate a car off a child
way beyond what any human strength
should be able to do when they need to
because they put their intention on it
so you see what i&#39;m saying
so we all have that within us every
single one of us
but also every single extraterrestrial
being
just remember that as we go through this
now that capability can be exploited
for the good
the common good for enlightenment for
healing
free energy all kinds of things or it
can be used as a weapon system
so i&#39;m not trying to scare the hell out
of you but by the end of
this you will be and
man but don&#39;t be but you you probably
will be but i&#39;m going to tell you
at the end why you shouldn&#39;t be uh okay
let&#39;s go to the next slide
and
this is a little more of a deep dive
into what we call
alien and the reason i want to
call this out for what it is
i mentioned a moment ago there are all
kinds
of um phenomena
being called alien
and i&#39;ve had i&#39;ve met with people who&#39;ve
had
encounters with like a poltergeist
you know what poltergeist is somebody
who&#39;s passed away and comes in and
you know moves something around they say
oh it was an alien in my house
well it was no such thing it was not an
extraterrestrial biological life form
from another planetary system
it was someone who lived in that house
200 years ago and it&#39;s
pissed off that you know he died somehow
unfortunately
i tell a great classic story of this and
so this gets into you know
this sort of experience where
they&#39;re in another dimension they&#39;re not
in the physical body anymore
the ancestral spirits poltergeists asked
for dimensions there could be lower and
higher frequency all the way to angelic
and celestial
but i was in the emergency department
once
i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard this story
but it&#39;s a it&#39;s illustrative
and it finally was quiet for one
nanosecond
and but previously a man had died in
the trauma one of the trauma rooms um
and
it was a violent death a murder and he
was intoxicated and he was not a happy
camper
and about three four in the morning in
the room the room in which he passed
away
now the whole emergency department&#39;s
empty and i&#39;m sitting there with the
nurses and the
secretary and we&#39;re just sort of hanging
out till the next case comes in
suddenly the ekg machine turns on the
cabinets open the iv
bags start being thrown out of the
cabinet and the iv
pole you know the drip beep beep drip
all that turns on
and if the whole thing is like a
whirlwind goes in this one little room
and it&#39;s this guy pissed off
he&#39;s really mad i did a little prayer
where i connected him to the most great
light
of that&#39;s within all things and all in
us
and sent him on his way and he stopped
and the nurses said what did you do
i said well i just kind of connected him
to where he needs to go
but this sort of thing almost all
critical care medical people
have a story like this and in the
emergency department you saw a lot of it
now that was an alien
that was a guy who just had been
murdered who was very
intoxicated and who was furious and came
in
and was able with his spirit body to
push into
this dimension a little bit and that&#39;s
what poltergeist says it&#39;s like the
movie ghost here
with demi moore have you ever seen it so
and that phenomenon is absolutely real
now
a lot of people have had experiences
with beings from other dimensions
that are not extraterrestrial that can
have that effect in this
plane and they will think it&#39;s an e.t
and it isn&#39;t
really important for you to get this um
so what is being called alien and what
has been
kind of thrown all together into one
category
are x actually extraterrestrial and
these are the ones that are
transdimensional interstellars i call
them tdis
these are e.t beans capable of
interstellar travel
using these advanced trans-dimensional
technologies where they go from one
point in space time to another
but not in a linear way they&#39;re dropping
out of linear space time
and traversing these dimensions
which means that they&#39;re not limited
by the normal limitations on matter
and space and time because otherwise
there&#39;d be no way they could go from
another star system to here
that&#39;s how they&#39;re doing it but there
are also et&#39;s that people can have
experiences with
that are planetary bound
let&#39;s say that you know i doubt anyone
in this room travels around to different
galaxies maybe i don&#39;t know but
unlikely but in consciousness you could
go to another planet
and you could actually visit an et
civilization
and you may see one that is at our stage
of development or even perhaps more
primitive
and that is through the field of
consciousness
and the ability to remote view and
teleport
using this subtle body so people have
had experiences with both
interstellar transdimensional ets that
are passing through other dimensions
but are from other star systems and
planets but also
ones that can be remote viewed or seen
or experienced in consciousness
and some of those civilizations could
also
get here and visit but without a
spacecraft
they don&#39;t have that technology yet just
like the aboriginals had dream time
as a routine way that they communicated
at night
in australia you know that story and
that&#39;s how they would know what to do
the next day and they&#39;d meet a friend in
the outback and they know where to
intersect at some remote area because
they did it during their dream
well you could do that if you can do it
10 miles away you can do it a billion
light years away there&#39;s
because you&#39;ve transcended space time
limitation
does this make sense yet all right i
mean it&#39;s
very abstract ideas but i&#39;m trying to
relate them to personal experiences that
all of you have had i&#39;m sure
so now you&#39;re talking about
civilizations that have
the ones uh that are interstellar have
very advanced
artificial intelligence what i mean by
that
their spacecraft are bio nano
machines every special operations force
guy i&#39;ve dealt with
has come up across one of these objects
that we have downed
using electromagnetic weapons we&#39;ll get
to in a moment
since the 40s that&#39;s what roswell was
and we&#39;ll tell you that
the craft themselves were living and the
craft
themselves were conscious they were
conscious
to the point the ai the artificial
intelligence associated with the
spacecraft
was at the level that the craft emanated
the consciousness of the pilot and the
craft itself has a
living organic quality to it even though
it&#39;s a machine
so it&#39;s a bio nano machine
that&#39;s conscious that&#39;s very different
from the clunky things lockheed martin&#39;s
making
this is i&#39;m giving you a little hint
here of how you can tell the difference
between
a covert military ufo
and an actual e.t spacecraft
interstellar
trans-dimensional zing
got it a little teachable moment there
when you go out onto the stars and
you&#39;re watching
so those spacecraft that are
interstellar
have this ability to emanate
the consciousness of the occupants
and they actually have their function in
movement according to the thought
uh now often they&#39;re touching
a panel and thinking and then the craft
will go here or there or what have you
or materialize or de-materialize
very very advanced stuff not your triple
seven
boeing triple seven now
so these uh
so the craft are interfacing with the
beans but then their communication
systems
are doing there are two ways that this
is happening
there&#39;s technology that is assisting
their consciousness so let&#39;s say they
want to see
another star system on a planet called
earth
and they may be a billion light years
from here they can connect to that
and it is an augmentation system a
magnification system
that is electromagnetic but very
advanced
that enables them to see using
consciousness
so the technology is assisting the
remote viewing function that is innately
within
all sentient beings does this make sense
but there&#39;s the reverse and that&#39;s the
consciousness assisted technology
so there are technologies on board all
the technologies on board these et craft
can also be interfacing with the
consciousness and thought
in coherent thought not random but very
directed
coherent intent thought of the
et&#39;s on board how many people have had a
fairly close encounter and seeing a
craft and felt that it was awake
felt that the craft itself was awake
yeah
they are but they&#39;re awake they&#39;re
actually just an extension
of the consciousness of the occupants
i know this gets into some weird stuff
fast in the first 35 minutes
but we got we&#39;re gonna get into a lot
weirder stuff pretty fast
so uh so the very high level ets
um you know their consciousness
would be similar to
these so the civilizations that have
been around
uh 10 to the 7th 10th to the 8th 10th to
the 9th years
you know millions to a billion years
longer than we have
both their technologies and their
consciousness would be at the celestial
slash
angelic level but they still have
planetary systems star systems physical
worlds but everyone on that planet even
at the time of birth is born into a
state of
cosmic consciousness and enlightenment
at the time of birth
eventually humans will evolve into one
of those level 12 civilizations
we&#39;re a level zero by the way
michi kaku makes this thing we have to
get to level one
which means you&#39;re peaceful not
destroying your environment and not
killing each other but we ain&#39;t got
there yet
all right we&#39;re trying to right that&#39;s
what we&#39;re working towards
well some of us most people
90 plus percent so that&#39;s another thing
to remember
in our ce5 expeditions close encounters
are the fifth time we&#39;ll be out
we&#39;ll be having an experience where the
experience with an et civilization
will be very similar to an experience
with one of the higher
angelic celestial but they&#39;re not and
they have spacecraft
i loved it when monsignor balducci the
senior theologian at the
vatican that paula harris who couldn&#39;t
be with us today she&#39;s in europe
introduced me to and he was you know he
was a senior theologian to pope john
paul and he said to me
you know angels and demons don&#39;t need
flying saucers
simple statement true statement
think about it
and you know we had a wonderful
discussion and his
testimony is in the disclosure material
as well um
as well as the senior astronomer for the
vatican
observatory and project most people
haven&#39;t read it
it&#39;s there and they confirm all of this
but
my point is the
civilizations that are extraordinarily
advanced
are going to really look like magic
now i have to point out to people let&#39;s
take a step back to all the
you know sort of time-centered
reductionist scientific people on the
planet listening to this
this cell phone if you went back
in time and handed this to thomas
jefferson
or worse to salem massachusetts
you would be considered a warlock a
witch
something i mean to have something and
be showing another a video on this from
another part of the world everything
we&#39;re using today
would look like magic to someone only
200 years ago
now let&#39;s extrapolate our technological
development
that we know about in the in the
non-classified world
you know the world of cnn in the new
york times i.e lame
um
they don&#39;t know anything and they&#39;re not
going to know anything so if the quote
spook the first time i was going to
brief the cia director he says
the president the cia director don&#39;t
know anything and they&#39;re not going to
know anything that&#39;s how he worded it
what a nasty piece of work
anyway uh so this
is something for you to think about is
that if we&#39;re we&#39;re talking about
civilizations that are
in the thousands to millions of years
more developed than we are
extrapolate how we&#39;ve developed since
say the early 1800s
to now 200 years
and factor in that about 100 years of
that period
the big breakthroughs in science
technology energy
propulsion anti-gravity even
consciousness technologies
have been suppressed and sequestered
into unacknowledged special access
projects
now extrapolate a few thousand years
forward
that&#39;s who and what we&#39;re dealing with
uh one civilization we had contact with
at joshua tree
uh there&#39;s a senior ambassador named
bijou that we took a photo
of some of you have seen it and when i
was asking him
you know what his iq was we had a series
of electromagnetic devices that we were
using for binary
yes no confirming communication with the
civilization
i said my sense is that your iq is
around 450
and it signaled yes and
so you know
most america average americans 110 115
and it&#39;s a algorithmic
scale so you&#39;re dealing with
civilizations that are
very very advanced incredibly
intelligent
highly conscious and we have to figure
their technologies are going to be a
corollary
are going to parallel that development
now the good news is
we&#39;re also developing that way they&#39;ve
done studies with meditators people who
meditate
actually have their iqs and ever go up
everyone&#39;s told that you&#39;re stuck with
what you&#39;re born with not
true not true
they actually can go up
is you develop higher states of
consciousness we&#39;ll get into
this and this is another subject but so
imagine civilizations that have been
involved with conscious evolution
with technological corollaries
for thousands to millions of years
longer than we have
so that&#39;s just keep that in mind as we
go through this
so these phenom this phenomenon of
interdimensional
weirdness often gets lumped into this
experience with actual ets and then
you get into the mother of all cluster
and it&#39;s excuse my french but
the french would be non-jew that&#39;s not
french um
but this where you&#39;re dealing with
classified
unacknowledged special access projects
uh that have the ability and have had
the ability since the 50s and 60s
to simulate like a simulator
alien experiences and just a short list
of those would be
things that look like ufos that are have
been termed arvs alien reproduction
vehicles
these were first being worked on
in the 40s and 50s i have a
a gentleman that i&#39;ve been meeting with
whose
father is a member of the majority
intelligence community
committee magic and
a senior u.s senator former
senior u.s senator and you know he was
talking about the fact that his
grandfather paul mellon
had gone over to uh germany at the end
of world war ii and retrieved
the secret weapon that hitler was
working on and that was a disk
and it was a and they also had a bell
that was
electromagnetographic sort of
anti-gravity but they hadn&#39;t worked out
the bugs they couldn&#39;t really control
they would wobble and crash and if they
hadn&#39;t got it perfected we got the
atomic
bomb before they perfected the the
anti-gravity devices however
paul mellon who along with alan dulles
and a few other people
were key to founding the cia
went over with george patton general
patton
and brought it back to the united states
along with the top
nazi scientists under operation
paperclip
and that you could mainstream history
books been written about operation paper
clip this is not a conspiracy theory
and you know these were people like
hermann oberth and vernon von braun a
lot of other really brilliant
uh scientists who had worked on these uh
sort of technologies
brought them in and they became the
foundation of our
not only intelligence community but our
aerospace early aerospace
research and development community in
the united states
which my uncle who worked on the lunar
module
was involved with northrop grumman but
they
were you know a generation before him
even in the 40s
so an interesting side note george
patton
wanted to disclose these technologies to
the public for the good of humanity
he was assassinated by the wetworks
teams wetworks or assassination squads
because he wanted to do so and
the result is during the eisenhower
years
the projects that were dealing with this
area of research
both extraterrestrial and man-made
came together in these unacknowledged
special access projects
although they were run into separate
compartments
so let me explain what i mean here and
you had all the way back to the 20s
t-towns and brown
working with very high voltage frequency
systems were in crystalline materials
where he would have objects levitate
right
this is a matter of public record and
his work then
got pulled into the rand corporation but
in the air force later in the air force
but there were also experiments going on
in germany the klosky frost experiment
and some others in the late 20s
so by the time the 40s came around there
had been a lot of experimentation
with vhv i call it very high voltage
systems that at
certain cycles per second that&#39;s called
hertz
and resonant fields and combined
resonant fields with specialized
materials
crystalline materials and what have you
would result in
a lifter effect anti-gravity effect
mass cancellation so those got developed
between the 20s and the 40s this is why
he called the chapter in that
book that book and in the in the
movie the lost century there&#39;s a whole
lost century of technology
we&#39;re running around with jet engines
and cars running
exxon mobil gasoline unnecessarily for a
hundred years
and we&#39;re paying the price now for the
environment and
geopolitically but
keep in mind that these technologies
were on the radar scope of classified
projects
long before the end of world war ii uh a
man who lived here in denver
some of you may have known dr alt
schuler how many people knew dr al
shuler he was a hematologist pathologist
wonderful man he&#39;s passed away his uncle
was general jimmy doolittle
of world war ii and all of you have
heard of foo fighters
i presume well not the band so they&#39;ve
they&#39;ve really named the band after this
what i&#39;m about to tell you
foo fighters were these things that we
call ufos in world war ii that were
zipping around our aircraft and what
have you
we thought it was a covert
axis you know of german
technology the germans thought it was a
covert allied
u.s british technology so
fdr roosevelt sent general doolittle
over to world war
over to the theater of operations to
look into this
and he looked into it and studied and
came back and told fdr
this was in the 40s early mid 40s
and said sir those are interplanetary
vehicles
quote unquote so this goes back at least
70 some years and probably longer
the part that people forget is that
the human mind and an extraterrestrial
mind can discover the same laws of the
universe because the laws of the
universe are universal
important point very important point
so there was this accelerating
discovery of electromagnetic
transdimensional and anti-gravity
sciences
in the 20s 30s 40s 50s that then got
potentiated greatly by the retrieval
of extraterrestrial vehicles the most
notorious being the roswell crash
which i&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all heard of but
that is by no means the only one nor was
it the first one
there were ones in the 30s and 40s and
those extraterrestrial technologies were
then put into
a compartmented operation tssci top
secret special compartmented in
information or intelligence that
was unacknowledged to be studied
and then there were people doing at the
same time work
in the conventional anti-gravity let&#39;s
call it electromagnetographics
is what is properly called anti-gravity
and other systems
and there are very few that would
communicate between the two
that was a highly specialized group of
people that could cross between
the conventional r d labs that were
classified and unacknowledged
and the extraterrestrial research
projects that were also
unacknowledged because
compartmentalization is the name of the
game
of secrecy uh a man who&#39;s recently
surfaced and is working with me
has been in uh was cleared to 18 of
these unacknowledged special access
projects or usaps and he&#39;s providing the
information about these 18
projects and he was in them between 2002
and 2012.
so it&#39;s a lot of current information
we&#39;ll get to that in a moment
now what i&#39;m trying to portray here
is something you need to know
historically because everyone will say
oh we have these air these spacecraft
that are arvs at lockheed martin luck
in northrop and boeing and all these
outfits that are in egng
those are people say oh those were all
based on et spacecraft they were not
they&#39;re a combination of man-made
breakthroughs in science and technology
that was classified
being pushed along by the study of
extraterrestrial technologies
which is a much heavier lift much harder
to do because you&#39;re looking at
something you have no clue
what it could be used for
the other part of that&#39;s being developed
and has been developed for some years
are is this area the program life forms
these are what people normally call
aliens the grays the this the that
i know men who&#39;ve worked in those labs
making these little creatures
they are they&#39;re kind of bugamy
they&#39;re sort of creepy but they have
integrated circuits in their
cortex but they are also biological so
there&#39;s a genetic program that will take
genetic material from a dead uh or
living extraterrestrial develop it
and then put in integrated circuits and
then create a sort of robotic creature
that passes quite well as an alien
there&#39;s a man who has lived in the area
named stan romanek and uh ricky
butterfast who&#39;s here
and i went to go visit him a few years
ago now i&#39;m sure all of you have seen
this uh
heard about his experience with boo and
this et that was popping up but what you
didn&#39;t see because i think disney bought
up the rights to it
was some footage of one getting into his
house when he had his camera running
and there were all these weird
electromagnetic effects happening in his
houses his
his medicine bottles the plastic was
melting and all kinds of weird stuff
and he shows us this video and i&#39;m
sitting there with ricky and a
mufon i think state director somebody
who researches this issue with mufon
and it shows this creature coming in and
it&#39;s
very jerky kind of moving
and then the camera falls over they&#39;ve
thrown a chemical canister in
he passes out has a classic abduction
experience
now to 99.99999999999999 percent of the
population
they&#39;ve just had an encounter with an
alien not
they had an encounter with one of these
you&#39;ve got to get your minds around this
now have people had
real experiences with real eats yes but
they get simulated someone who&#39;s had an
actual experience with a real e.t
sometimes to confuse them will then be
targeted with a plf and an arb and a lot
of other weird stuff we&#39;re going to get
into
to confuse their memory and experience
counter intelligence programs are quite
well developed in this area
quite well and very good at what they do
so i turned to
stan and the other people i said well
that&#39;s a plf and he said what&#39;s that
i said you cannot be doing ufo research
and not know what a program life form is
or an arv is
since about 80 percent of the phenomenon
being reported
is this not this
this gets blacklisted
these get reported and published
because the publishing houses the big
media will be told
cover this don&#39;t cover this
i told you it&#39;d be a mind [ __ ] so
but excuse my third time i&#39;ve used that
word sorry but i think what you have to
begin to understand is that it is
because you know in 1991 92 93 when i
was first emerging into this area
i didn&#39;t think any of this could be
possible it is
and this is what they don&#39;t want you to
know they want you to be confused
and they want you to be played to
support the alien invasion agenda which
is the big punch line of the secrecy
that and keeping the technology secret
so we have to burn oil
and make people trillions of dollars
that way but
you have to understand this these
are even more concerning and this
has been going on since
at least the 50s that i know about 1950s
so give you a timeline anti-gravity
gravity control
october 1954 is when that was mastered
program life forms were later
in the 60s 70s 80s in the 50s
and 60s they were using a lot of stage
craft with
people made up to look like an e.t i&#39;ve
talked with some intelligence people who
said oh yeah we take someone who is
very short or very unusual looking and
do a certain kind of makeup like in
hollywood and put them on board one of
these
arvs and have them abduct somebody very
effective
stagecraft it&#39;s called the
electromagnetic interdimensional portals
are even a greater concern and some of
you have heard of these sort of events
happening in places like montauk
and other facilities where
also at the lockheed skunk works and i
remember meeting with the skunk works
very highly classified officers
actually it was a man who was introduced
to me by the head of
lockheed international and they had a
laboratory where they could hook people
up to an electromagnetic console
to tap into these other dimensions not
e.t
and bring into 3d
an actual being from that dimension and
it&#39;d be running around the lab
like some kind of monster or boogham
very advanced stuff be in the hands of
some very
strange people with an agenda to deceive
counter intelligence is all about
deception
so then have i lost you all yet
just we ain&#39;t got started yet huh
