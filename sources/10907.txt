get him here quick!  Then they turned on the siren and sped up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When  we got to the hospital I was in the emergency room and the doctor asked me if I  had been smoking crack cocaine, I told him no.   I had two more trainees trying to put IVs in my arms.  As they were working, the doctor asked me  again about the coke.  Again, I said  no.  He told me the reason was that, if I  had, he was going to give me a new type of blood thinner and, if had smoked  crack, I would bleed out and die.  Just  as they started to put the medicine in, my heart stopped and I died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The  instant I died I was standing in front of the brightest light I have ever seen,  but it didn't hurt my eyes to look at it.   I was standing in pitch blackness and then this voice came into my head  telling me to step into the light, so I thought to myself, 'I don't know about  that, I've never experienced anything like this before.'  Then the voice said it again so I stepped  into the light.  It's hard to explain the  feeling I had when I first stepped in it.   It was like every cell in my body came alive with the most exhilarating  feeling of love like you have never felt in all your life.  The first thing I felt was an overpowering  feeling of love, then came peace, and then came contentment.  I was only dead about two or three minutes but  it took me about a minute to recuperate from that.  Then I started looking around and I saw  flowers and trees.  Everything around me  felt like it was emanating love towards me, and then all of a sudden I was  looking at the doctor's face.  I was so  mad that he had done that that I grabbed his shirt collar and asked him why he  did that.  He pointed to my wife and  mother and said, 'They told me to!'  I've  been wanting to go back ever since!!!

  Experience Description 3754  					</p>  					I was having a heart attack and the ambulance took me to the hospital.  I was in the emergency room on the gurney and two assistants were putting IV's in my arms when a clot came up the main vein in my heart and shut off the flow of blood.  I died.

As soon as I died I was standing in total darkness, and right in front of me was the brightest light you had ever seen in your life but it did not hurt your eyes to look at it.  Then this voice came from the light saying to me 'step into the light, step into the light.'  At first, I was scared because I had never been in a situation like that before.  After the voice repeated the saying again, I stepped into the light.  When I did it hit me like a ton of bricks!!!  The first thing I felt was overwhelming LOVE!!! The next thing I felt was true peace and contentment, it seemed like I was home!

Unfortunately, I was only dead for a couple of minutes.  I was starting to get over how I felt and started to look around saw like a garden of sorts.  The colors were so brilliant and so rich, nothing like here on earth.

As I was looking around, the next thing I know, I'm looking at the doctor's face as I opened my eyes!  I was so angry with him for bringing me back to life.  I asked why he had done that and he said that my wife and mother had asked him to.  I wish the doctor had left me dead but I know that GOD is not ready for me yet or he would have let me stay!  That's about it!
