  		              		Experience Description   

    My cousins and I were in a hay barn in the attic.  We were running around in circles when I fell 15 feet through a hole.  I landed flat on my back and onto the concrete floor. My cousins said it all happened in a matter of seconds, but to me, it felt like a half hour. I recall floating above myself right after I landed. I could see myself lying there. Then, it was SUPER bright with clouds.  Then, it got dark and I woke up.

 I could stand up perfectly but it felt like I weighed a million pounds. I could barely walk. 

I vividly remember seeing myself from up above my body. It was peaceful, no sound, and filled with blindingly, bright light. Thank you.
