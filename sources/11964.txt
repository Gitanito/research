To my left and up about shoulder height were people and scenes I recognized from events that had happened in my life prior to where I was at the time - when I reached the point of the accident that spawned this coma. When I reached the point of the accident, I turned and walked back past the events I had just witnessed. When I reached the last event I entered a stone cottage and in the cottage were two very old beings, they reminded me of 'Yoda' in the movie 'Star Wars'. These beings were to my right and in front of me was a big picture window or opening. I could see a large green meadow and there was a church down at the bottom of a hill. I wanted to go out into it but the two beings said I could not. When I asked why they said 'You are not ready.' I walked back down the path to the accident. This experience stays fresh in my mind while I can't remember anything else. I suffered a traumatic brain injury and have a really bad memory. I am no longer afraid of dying I am sure there is more for us after this life.
