In bringing out the second edition of ‘‘Hartmann’s Who’s W ho,” under the
Itle of “W ho’s Who in Occultism, New Thought, Psychism and Spiritualism,” we
6 so in order to differentiate this volume from the: first issue which was published
November, 1925, under the title of “W ho’s Who in Occult, Psychic and Spiritual
ealms,” and to more clearly indicate the diversified scope of the work;
This book is primarily intended to be a volume of reference, and contains no
ement of propaganda in the interest of any particular school of thought. It has
geri compiled as an informative book, for the purpose of indicating the activities
various societies and individuals, interested in the study of the “Science of Life,”
ough the many different channels embodied therein and to act as a beacon light
those of the “one-track-mind” variety of mentality, bringing to their attention
ilosbphies and schools of thought, other than their own, that might also be worth
hile studying towards the realization of the essence of “Truth.”
/,;The production of a volume such as this entails an endless amount of labor and
pfrespondence, running into thousands of different channels, but we are intensely
:
^tified to realize that our first effort was well received by students the world over,
hbook having been sold in more than twenty-five different countries. Many com­
binatory letters have reached us in appreciation of our work, and we are sincerely
teful to all of the many pen-friends our work has made for us. W e also wish.
feeder our grateful acknowledgment of the favorable manner in which the editors

T F I can throw a single ray of. light
X Across the darkened pithway of another ;•
If I can aid some soul to clearer sight
Of life and duty, and thus bless my brother;-' ;
I f I can wipe from any human cheek a tear,
I shall not then havje; lived in vain while herei /
TlX can guide some erring-one to truth, ■
Inspire within his heart a sense of duty;
I f I can plant within; the soul of rosy youth
A sense of right, a love of truth and beauty;
If I can teach one roan that God and Heaven are near,
I shall not then have lived in vain while here.
If from my mind I banish doubt and fear,
And keep my life attuned -to love and kindness; ‘
If I can scatter light and hope and cheer,
And help remove the curse of mental blindness;
If I can make mOEeijoy, spore hope, less pain,:; ’
I shall not then have lived and loved in vain.
If by life’s roadside I can plant a tree.
Beneath whose shade some wearied head may rest;
Though I. may never share its shade, or see
Its beauty, I shall yet be truly blest—
Though no one knows my name, nor drops a flower upon my bier!
I shall not then have lived in vain while here.

guilder construction. Thfe Brotherhood deals with the Essenic system of. Astrd^Sil
{Pathology as handed doWn under Divine Guidance, and interpreted by this devOt^S;
JJtfiSdjr of men. Many separate bodies of the Essenes have lived, worked for
IfcSuse and died, but the grand truth of Astro-Pathology remains. Just as error M
Jdies hard, but does eventually perish, so truth arises phoenix-like from tb ev erif||r
:ashes, and the time has arrived for this great truth to again emerge from dar6f';{{
s ness into light. Fixing Its natural base in the science of Botany, and using
'{herbs of the ground, It Applies these in a manner that awakens the three gred${.;f|
/^centres in human anatoidy and produces results different and distinct from dthef
* {methods. The Essenic. System of Philosophy and Healing is based upon thisi.
Divine Trinity using botany for the body, psychology for the soul and theDj:

The Melehezedek Society is composed of many thousands of members, belongings

Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (North American Jurisdiction of f
The AMORC is an International Rosicrucian organisation. It is well established Wm
in every civilized country of the world. In all of the principle cities of Europe, Asia,44|||
Africa and the Occidental world, there are branches, in the form of Colleges, Lodges, ’111
study groups and, in some lands, Universities. There are many forms of Rosicrucian ij
organizations throughout the world. Some are known as Fellowships, some as ■
-
Societies and others as Colleges, But there is only one organization, Internationally .
known as the ORDER. The AMORC in North America is a part of that ORDER,
The AMORC of North America is incorporated in some states as a University, or 4^1
is a College in other states, and as a general non-profit corporation, under its own
lame "Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis.” It also possesses a United
States patent on the name, “Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis,” and on the
lymbol of the cross with one rose in the center, which is the ancient and true form
if the Rosicrucian symbol. No other organization in the world but AMORC pos-
esses such a patent protection of the name and symbol. The AMORC of today in
ISpSt&'.of antiquity. It teaches its members and students through personal, private
Eefmfction in all of the arcane principles of Metaphysics, Psychology, Mentaiisoi;'-|fp

I f Objects. (Extracts from the Statutes.) Those persons, and also the Groups
I t represented, who are present at the foundation Meeting at Christmas, 1923. . . .
K “are convinced that there is in existence at the present time a real Science of
|;i the Spiritual World-discovered and elaborated for years pa3t, and, in important
p particulars, already published, They hold, moreover, that the civilisation of today
needs the cultivation of such a science. This is to be the task of the Anthro-
p posophical Society. It will endeavor to fulfill the task by centering Us activities
| on the spiritual science of Anthroposophy cultivated in the Goetheanum at Dornach,
p with all that results from it for human brotherhood, for moral and religious life,
i§ and for the artistic and cultural life in humanity.”
They confirm the view Of the Central Executive that: “The Anthroposophy
pursued in the Goetheanum leads to results which can he of assistance to every
human being—without distinction of nation, social standing or religion—acting as
an incentive in spiritual life. These results can in a sense give rise to a social
life based on brotherly love. The possibility of making them one’s own and
founding life upon them depends on no special degree of learning or education,
but alone on a free, unbiased* human nature. The researches, however, which lead
to them, and the power of Competent judgment on the results of research, are
subject to a spirltual-scientifld training, which must be acquired step by step. The
results are in their way no less exact than those of Natural Science; andi when,
like these, they attain general recognition, they will bring about a like progress
In all spheres of life—not only in the spiritual but In the practical domain.

;Baha’i Movement
rs A statement of the purpose and principles of the Bah&’l faith:
* “The source of all learning is the knowledge of God, exalted be His glory! and
feihis cannot be attained save through the knowledge of His divine Manifestation,”
FBahAu’lldh.
For more than eighty ycats, the Babd’f Cause has been steadfastly presented to
£ the world as the expression fdr this age of the same universal Spirit which in other
p ages spoke through Zoroaster, Muhammed, the Buddha, Moses, Christ, one Divine
^utterance and continuous purpose, giving forth one and the same message, albeit
|- adapted to the conditions and human capacities of each time. In Bahd’u’Mh, ac-
:cording to His explicit text, the Message of God has been revealed to mankind in its
’fullness and universality, anct the Bahh’i Cause accordingly represents the fulfill­
ment of that which was but Martially revealed, in previous dispensations.
The objects of the Baha’i Cause are identical with the true objects of all re­
vealed religion: to raise man from tho earthly to the heavenly condition; to sub­
stitute spiritual laws and realties for natural laws and realities operating in the
darkness of unfaith; to initiate a new age and era of progress and attainment in the
world of mind; to transform civilization into the glory of the Kingdom—but what
has been partially revealed is iiow made complete and what has been cherished as the
secret experience of a few souis is now established as the determining power molding
the life of the world.
To achieve these objectSj Bahfi’u’llhh bestowed upon humanity a perfect model
and criterion of truth, first, id His- own life, then in His written teachings. The life
of Bah&’u’ll&h shows forth th# same providential destiny as the lives of those Man­
ifestations who arose in ancient and later times. It was the same victory of the
Spirit beset by ignorance afid hate;, the same sacrifice, the same glory. But
BahA’u'Udh was not slain nor prevented from giving His full message. The written
text surviving Him guides the faithful followers into all truth.
The utterances of Bah&Vliah conveys the spirit of religion throughout the
circle of the experiences of life. They enlarge the area of religion to Include reality

^|*"BafiU’ii’ltAi taught,” writes Dr. J. E. Esslemont, '“
that .the Prophet;

li^rM ger of the natural world. Just as the material sun shines over the*
^pfoflaaea the growth and development of material organisms, so also, th

-God influences the lives of all, and inspires receptive minds even in plS£
? among people where the name of the Prophet is quite unknown. The adven
i Manifestation is like the coming of the Spring. It is a day of resurrection
vihe spirtuall y dead are raised to new life, in which the Reality of the Divine:'
'is renewed and re-established, In which appear 'new heavens and a new ear;
1 1 || - ■ “Cut. in the world of nature, the Spring brings about not only the gro
p jii awakening of new life, hut also the destruction and removal of the old and ei
the same ■sun, that makes the flowers to spring and the trees to bud, eauieir
t. '1.1,'^e decay and disintegration of what is dead and useless; it loosens the ice and
the snow of winter, and sets free the flood and the storm that cleanse and pur
t earth. So is it also in the spiritual world. The spiritual sunshine causes f „
p lp l commotion and change. Thus the Day of Resurrection is also the Day of JudgL
which corruptions and imitations of the truth and outworn ideas and custom*
discarded and destroyed, in which the ice and snow of prejudice and supersG'
which accumulated during the season of winter, are melted and transformed,|r
energies long frozen and pent up are released to flood and renovate the world/'V:
Religion renews the spirit of faith and confirms the ideals of the prey
Prophets and Messengers; but Religion also progresses and in each cycle disclo
a new aspect of truth. That which the Baha’i Cause contains not revealed inf*
1 4 existing religion is the principle of the Oneness of Mankind.
5 %£ It is in the light of this principle that all the Bahai writings are to be

breathed into the soul of humanity in this age which shall remove all
. .difference, misunderstanding, discord and disagreement—causes resident in cue*
and institutions as well as in personal opinions and emotions—and establish
means and methods as well as the desire of unity~is of the essence of the Ba"
teaching and faith. The rapidly altering character of human life throughout
world is one of the proofs' of the mission of Bahd'u’lidh.
The principle of oneness involves so many readjustments, mental, social
spiritual, that the wars and strifes of these latter times have been inevitable,
the life and writings of “Abdu’l-BahS, we have the supreme effort to prepare huma
for the understanding of Bahd’u’lldh and the power manifested in Him.
Bahd gave to Batod’u’llSh’s message an interpretation directly and immediately
plying to the nature of those readjustments. The interpretation is one with
message, as the sunlight is one with the sun. ‘Abdu’l-Bahii has revealed the sig-'
nificance of the Bahd’t Cause in setting forth the following Principles:
1. Unfettered search after truth and the abandonment of all superstition ah
prejudice.
2. The Oneness of Mankind: all are “leaves of one tree, flowers in one garden.":
3. Religion must be a eauso of love and harmony, else it is no religion.
4. All religions are one in their fundamental principles.
5. Religion must conform with science. Faith and reason must be in full
accord.
6. Universal Peace: the establishment of universal League of Nations, of in­
ternational arbitration and an International Parliament.
7. The adoption of an auxiliary international language which shall be taught
in all the schools of the world.
S. Compulsory education especially for girls, who will be mothers and the
first educators of the next generation.

Brotherhood of Bifurcated Jackasses
(A serious effort on the pbft of the conductor, "Freedom Hill Henry” of Roscoe,
.3al.) HA says, “Since some of my visitors can not take the cosmic conscious
Poachings straight, I camouflage them with cream and sugar, as in this invitation:
"The Stable.
"My Dear Brother Longears:
“This official document of. the B. 0. B. J. (Brotherhood of Bifurcated Jack-
masses) is to inform you that the Stable will be open to specially invited members
Jof good kicking every Saturday evening. And you are invited. Stalls will be
provided, well bedded with straV and cattails for sleeping.
“The purpose of this arrangement is to enable you, after having worn your
' harness all week, to lay off Vour pack-saddle on which you have carried your
i burdens of civilization, financlhlization, and society’s regulation, and take a rest
- by actively becoming your natural jackass self. To rest as you did when a boy
i or girl back east and went fishing, swimming, nutting or to an apple-cutting.
“In these frolics yon will be allowed to lay off all burdens, all troubles, all
restraints, constraints and disttaints. You will be allowed to bray, sing, kick, yell,
recite, dance, play tricks, roll over, laugh out loud and do other things that a
Bifurcated J. might feel like doing when turned loose in a corral of other ‘birds
of like feather.’
“I will try to keep away critics, arguers, calamity howlers and others All-wisers
so you can be crooked without having to suffer the operation of being straightened
by the ‘jawbone of an ass.‘
“Come any Saturday evening, with hay and carrots and you will find the Chief
with his long ears, and perhaps a number of smaller B. J’s.
“He! Haw! Till we meet Again.

Liberal Catholic Church, The
Statement of Principles
The Liberal Catholic Church exists to forward the work of her Master—Christ—
in the world, and to feed His flock.
It is an independent and autonomous body, in no way dependent upon the See of
Rome, or upon any other see or authority outside its own administration. It is neither
Roman Catholic nor Protestant—but Catholie. It is called Liberal Catholic because
its outlook is both liberal and Catholic. Catholic means universal, but the word has
also come to stand for the outlook of the historical Church as distinct from that of
the later sects. The Liberal Catholic Church allies itself with this historical tradition.
It aims at combining the Catholic form of worship—Sts stately ritual, its deep mys­
ticism and its abiding witness to the reality of sacramental grace—with the widest
measure of intellectual liberty and respect for the individual conscience.

J o t Liberal Catholic Church tame into existence as the result of a complete
ganization in 1915-16 of the old Catholic movement in Great Britain, which de-
,j|ts Orders from the mother-sec of the Old Catholic movement, the ancient
lejlscopal see of Utrecht in Holland. The Liberal Catholic Church has carefully
Stored this succession of OrderS; but took its present name for a variety of reasons.*
jptme "Old Catholic” labours, especially in newer countries, under the constant
pterions disadvantage of being confused with "Roman Catholic." Further, the
jobs and doctrinal outlook of historical Old Catholicism is not that of the Liberal
ip lic Church, which has nothing to do with the policy or organization of the
f inental Old Catholic Churcheil and does not wish that there should he Imputed
Jphem principles of liberalism Ih religion which would still be distasteful to the
ffiirch of Utrecht and the majority of the Churches in communion with her. If it
'Mribes itself as "Old Catholic,” it does so to indicate the source of its Orders and
Ifbtganic unity with the historical church. ...__

Definitions Adopted by the National Spiritualist Association October 9, 1914, and
October 24, 1919
1. Spiritualism is the Science, Philosophy and Religion of continuous life, based
upon the demonstrated fact cut communication, by means of mediumship, with those :
Ijjirlio live in the Spirit World. .;
£
;■ 2. A Spiritualist is one tfho believes, as a part of his or her religion. In the
^communication between this, aid the spirit world by means of mediumship, and who
|%iideavors to mould his or her character and conduct in accordance with the highest
teachings derived from such cofnmunion.
'■ 3. A Medium is one whose organism is sensitive to vibrations from the spirit
/world, and through whose instrumentality, intelligence in that world are able to
I convey messages and produce the phenomena of Spiritualism.
“Spiritualism Is a Science" because it investigates, analyzes and classifies facts
^and manifestations, demonstrated from the spirit side of life.
"Spiritualism Is a Philosophy” because it studies the laws of nature both on
| the seen and unseen sides of life and bases its conclusions upon present observed
facta. It accepts statements of observed facts of past ages and conclusions drawn
.—
jtherefrom, when sustained by reason and by results of observed facts of the present
I t day.
''Spiritualism Is a Religion" because it strives to understand and to comply with
Ifthe Physical, Mental and ,
Spiritual Laws of Nature, “which are the laws of God."
What Spiritualism is and Does
It teaches personal responsibility.
It removes all fear of death* which is really the portal of the spirit world.
It teaches that death is not the cessation of life, but mere change of condition.
It teaches, not that a man has a soul, but that man is a soul, and has a body.
That man Is a spiritual being now, even while encased in flesh.
That as man sows on earth he reaps in the life to come.
That those who have passed on are conscious—not asleep.
That communion between the living and the "dead" is scientifically proved.
- It thus brings comfort to the bereaved, and alleviates sorrow.
Spiritualism is the Science, Philosophy and Religion of continuous life, based upon
the demonstrated fact of comnlunicatlon, by means of mediumship, with those who
live in the Spirit World.
It brings to the surface man's spiritual gifts, such as inspiration, clairvoyance,
clairaudience and healing powefs.
It teaches that the spark of divinity dwells in all.
That as a flower gradually unfolds in beauty, so the spirit of man unfolds and
develops in the spirit spheres. :
Spiritualism is God’s meBSage to mortals, declaring that There Is No Death.
That all who have passed on still live. That there is hope in the life beyond for the
most sinfuL
That every soul will progress through the ages to heights, sublime and glorious,
where God Is Love and Love Is God.
It iB a manifestation, a demonstration, and a proof of the continuity of life and
of the truth of the many Spirit manifestations recorded in the Bible.
It demonstrates the many Spiritual gifts with which mankind is endowed but
which through want of knowledge have been allowed to lay dormant, or through
/prejudice have been violently and unjustly suppressed,

■
has always existed and through which all Souls who have reached Mastery have
1passed on some plane, at a certain stage of their evolution. It has been represented
upon the earth-plane at certaid cyclic intervals in all ages, and has been known
under various names, yet always emphasizing the universality of Truth and present­
ing a Cosmic Philosophy which can be interpreted and used by every sincere seeker
;after Truth from his own angle Of vision and at any stage of unfoldment he may reach.
Its manifestation upon the earth-plane during the present cycle began on January
1st, 1908, its numerical name. The Order of the 15, being then used. But now that
the Order is reaching, in ever Increasing numbers, that great class who have been
looked upon as orthodox Christians, yet who are eagerly seking more definite instruc­
tion concerning the mysteries of the spiritual life, the name of the philosophy which
the Order presents is used instead.
The Order of Christian Myltics is a non-sectarian, unifying spiritual movement,
inspired by an unselfish love for humanity, and a desire to help mankind to recognise
the reality, and make practical tlso, of Its spiritual guidance In the daily life.
It is Christian in that it seeks the universal Cosmic Christ Principle, no matter
by what name that Universal Principle is known in other lands; and in that it bases,
its teachings on the Christian rftther than on Oriental scriptures. It is Mystic in that
it teacheB its pupils the mystefy of how to come Into personal and conscious touch
with the Christ-consciousness Within, and with the Spiritual Teachers in the hlghe;
realms.

Periods of religious development and decline, followed by a regeneration o

more rational systems, have occurred in the past. The rejuvenation __
as been coincident with the demand and thus met the need of advanced Souls
Ire seeking the WAY and became, therefore, the teachers and leaders

“History repeats itself,” and this age is but a repetition of ages passed
More than seventy years ago an advanced! Soul, Dr. P. B. Randolph, ga
hose who were then ready,, the true Rosicrucian teachings, founding the
crucian Fraternity (Rose Cross Order) on American soil, since which time, i
pbrious Masters of the Order, the teachings have been disseminated with
'result that today the work Is established firmly throughout the world.
£v The Rose Cross Order wfit no new organization. There never was a time when
||fi was not Under various nomenclatures it has ruled the destinies of nations as if<|l
f|well as individuals. In aucieht Atlantis, the “lost continent,” existing before this £ ;
f?bn which we now live, Initiates reached heights of spiritual unfoldment incon-'4fS
Pjceivable to the average man of today. When Atlantis was destroyed by the Deluge,
felts higher Jnitaties took refufee and established the Order on Egyptian soil, and,
liJrom this nucleus, ancient Egypt became the seat of learning, the depository of
If-WIsdom and its religion, and to its Temples came those who developed Into prophets,
seers and the great leaders Of the world of that day. By the teachers of those
Temples Joseph was made the man he was. Due to that ancient teaching Moses
was enabled to talk with God “face to face” through the medium of the fire in the
burning bush and on the Modtit when he received the Commandments. Jesus, the
young man, was taken into Egypt from whence the “wise men of the East,” the
Magi, had traveled when hd was born and there received his instructions and
training. ; .
Poland, under Stansilang find his Knighthood, was for a long time the center of:
Rosicrucian teachings. So also was France under Napoleon. It was from these
nations that Randolph received his instructions and authority.
Dr. P. B. Randolph founded the Triple Order in America in 1856-58, and the
history may be found In The Rose Cross Order and The Rosicrucians: Their
Teachings. By R. Swlnburnl Clymer, the present Supreme Hierarch of the Fra­
ternity.
Ever there has been an inner and an outer teaching, an interpretation which
satisfies the masses on the ohe hand and the Initiates on the other. Jesus himself
is reported to have said, “Ye that have ears to hear, let him hear,” indicating that
there was an inner as well aS an outer meaning of his words. To-day men have an

The Sevatan International is a unique philosophical organization composed en­
tirely of art-craftsmen who are liberal religionists. Its philosophy is embodied in the
*.Book of Sevata, an ancient Arabic work of unknown origin. Membership is by in-
tvltatton, there being approximately 600 associates throughout the world. Officers of
• the International are negotiating for a tract of land in the Mississippi Valley where
a colony of art-craftsmen will be established.

Societas Rosicrudana in America
The Societas Rosicrudana in America is the fourth institution of the Rosicrucian
Fraternity in the United Staffs.
The first Rosicrucian foundation was that of Fr. Johann Kelpius, in 1694. The
monastery was situate on the banks of the Wissahiekon, near Germantown, Philadel­
phia, Pa. This foundation has long since been extinct and no connection remains
to the present day.
. The second foundation was attempted by Pascal Beverly Randolph, who founded
the “Brotherhood of Roaicruciftns” in New England, in the early 60’s. He afterwards
founded the Temple of the Rosy Cross, South and West. He was succeeded by
Freeman B. Dowd, and the last Grand Master in direct succession was Edward H.
Brown, of Salem, Mass. Since the passing of Frater Brown, we have not been
apprised of any successor add have no Information that the organization is still
active.
The third foundation was on Masonic lines, in 1878, deriving from the Societas
Rosicruciana in Anglia and SShtia, and in 1889 Fr. Charles E. Meyer became Supreme
Magus of the “Soeietatis Rdfeierucianae iu the United States.” Restricted in its
nature, this organization had never been active in propagandised and appears to
have been more in the nature of a social body with quarterly meetings. Many of the
older Colleges are now inoperative and few traces of it appear.
The Sodetas Rosicrudana in America, deriving from the English Fraternity, was
incorporated in 1912 and is, therefore, the active American Branch of the Rosicrucian
Fraternity. It has no connection with any other bodies claiming to be Rosicrucian
in name or nature in this emintry. It follows the strict Rosicrucian procedure and
maintains Work in. Alchemy, Astrology, Hermetieism, Rosicruclanism, Natural Phi­
losophy and Theology.

Sufi Movement
The Objects of the Movement
1. To realize and spread the knowledge of. Unity, the religion of love and wis­
dom, so that the bias'of faiths and beliefs may of itself fall away, the human heart
may overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences may be
rooted out.
2. To discover the light and power latent in man, the secret of all religion, the
power of mysticism, and the essence of philosophy, without interfering with customs
and belief.
3. To help to bring the world’s two opposite poles. East and West, close together
by the interchange of thought and ideas; that the universal brotherhood may form
of itself, and man may meet with man beyond the narrow national and racial
boundaries.
The Sufi Message
The Sufi Message was borile to the Western World by Xnayat Khan, who answered
the call by leaving India for America in 1910. In response to the world-demand of
the time he gave Sufism a uhiversal form, thus giving body to the soul of wisdom
which had. been conceived for centuries in the heart of the inner cult of the ancient
Sufis. V

:Theosophical Society, The (Adyar, Madras, India)
THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY was formed at New York, November 17, 1875,
y; and Incorporated a t Madras, April 3, 1905. It is an absolutely unsectarian body qf^
seekers after Truth, striving to serve humanity on spiritual lines, and therefore};
endeavoring to check materialism and revive religious tendency. Its three declared
•'.v
- objects are*. ' . i
First.—To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without V
distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color.
Second.—To encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy and science.
Third.—To investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in
man. / ^
, THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY is composed of students, belonging to any re­
ligion in the world or to none, who are united by their approval of the above objects,
> 'by their wish to remove religious antagonisms and to draw together men of good-will
;; whatsoever their religious opinions, and by their desire to study religious truths and
' to share the results of their studies with others. Their bond of union is not the
profession of a common belief, but a common search and aspiration for Truth. They
hold that Truth should be sought by study, by reflection, by purity of life, by devotion
to high ideals, and they regard Truth as a prize to be striven for, not as a dogma to
be imposed by authority. They consider that belief should be the result of individual
study or intuition, and not its antecedent, and should rest on knowledge, not on
assertion. They extend tolerance to all, even to the intolerant, not as a privilege
they bestow, but as a duty they perform, and they seek to remove ignorance, not
to punish it. They see every religion as an expression of the Divine Wisdom and
prefer its study to its condemnation, and its practice to proselytism. Peace is their
watchword, as Truth is their aim.
THEOSOPHY is the body of truths which forms the basis of all religions, and
which cannot be claimed as the exclusive possession of any. It offers a philosophy
which renders life intelligible, and which demonstrates the Justice and the love which
guide its evolution. It puts death in its rightful place, as a recurring incident in an
endless life, opening the gateway to a fuller and more radiant existence. It restores
to the world the Science of the Spirit teaching man to know the Spirit as himself,
and the mind and body as his servants. It illuminates the scriptures and doctrines
of religions by unveiling their hidden meanings, and thus justifying them at the bar
of intelligence, as they are ever justified in the eyes of intuition.
M embers of the Theosophical Society study these truths, and Theosophists
endeavor to live them. Every one willing to study, to be tolerant, to aim highland to
work perseveringly, is welcomed as a member, and it rests with the member to
become a true Theosophlst.
Freedom of Thought
As the Theosophical Society has spread far and wide over the civilteed world,
and as mem bers of all religions have become members of it, without surrendering
^special dogmas, teachings and beliefs of their respective faiths, it is thotrgfit;;
lrable to emphasize the fact that there is no doctrine, no opinion, by wimmsO^p^
at or held, that is in any why binding on any member of the Society, none which
member is not free to accent or reject. Approval of its three objects is the sole
adltlon of membership. No teacher nor writer, from H. P. Blavatsky downwards,
any authority to impose hts teachings or opinions on members. Every member
an equal right to attach hlfnself to any teacher or to any school of thought which
aay choose, but has no right to force his choice on any other. Neither a candidate
| any office, nor any voter, dan be rendered ineligible to stand or to vote, because
f,any opinion he may hold, hfr because of membership In any school of thought to
,ich he may belong. Opinions or beliefs neither bestow privileges nor inflict.
ehaltles. The Members of the General Council earnestly request every member:
the T. S. to maintain, defehd and act upon these fundamental principles of tjj§*!
ociety, and also fearlessly td exercise his own right of liberty of thought and
cpression thereof, within the limits of courtesy and consideration for others.
f*. Colonel Henry Steel Olcott was the flrst President of the Society and held the *
^office continuously until his death in 1906, serving in that capacity nearly 32 years; ’
:.The office thus vacated by dellth was filled by the election of Mrs. Annie Besant as^
.International President.
Transcendent Science, Society of
This organization is similar to the one started in the United States by Ralph . ^
Waldo Emerson, which teaches Transcendentalism. The Fundamental Principles
. of Transcendent Science is "Inherent Reasons” in man, which, according to this
Vdoctrine, is the abode of Truth, and by certain processes of ideation and intellectual-
tion one can attain to the statS of "direct cognition” and bring into consciousness the
inherent or “lying dormant" and inherent knowledge which is contained In one’s
! own mind.
!' United Lodge of Theosophists
The policy of this Lodge is independent devotion to the cause of Theosophy,
without professing attachment to any Theosophical organization. It is loyal to the
great Founders of the Theosofrhical Movement, but does not concern itself with dis­
sensions or differences of individual opinion.
The work it has on hand And the end it keeps in view are too absorbing and too
lofty to leave it the time or inclination to take part in side issues. That work and
that end is the dissemlnatloii of the Fundamental Principles of the Philosophy of
Theosophy, and the exemplification in practice of those principles, through a truer
realization of the SELF; a profounder conviction of Universal Brotherhood.
It holds that the unassailable Basis for Union among Theosophists, wherever and
however situated, is “simillarlty of aim, purpose and teaching,” and therefore has
neither Constitution, By-Laws ,feor Officers, the sole bond between its Associates being
that basis. And it aims to disseminate this idea among Theosophists in the further­
ance of Unity.
It regards as TheosophistA all who are engaged in the true service of Humanity,
without distinction of race, creed, sex, condition or organization, and
It welcomes to its association all those who are in accord with its declared pur­
poses and who desire to fit themselves, by study and otherwise, to be the better able
to help and teach others.
“The true Theosophlst beibngs to no cult or sect, yet belongs to each and all.”
Being in sympathy with the purposes of this Lodge, as set forth In its
"Declaration,” I hereby record my desire to be enrolled as an Associate; it
being understood that sufch association calls for no obligation on my part
other than that which I, myself, determine.
The foregoing is the Fortn signed by Associates of the United Lodge of The­
osophists.
Inquiries are invited froln all persons to whom this Movement may appeal.

based on the occult as it may ever be your fortune to

skilled studio photography.

riences and other current information pertaining to this
interesting subject. Cash prizes are continually offered,
many of which you, yourself, may well establish your
claim to.
If you are not already familiar with Ghost Stories
Magazine, by all means start your acquaintance today

uneducated people often acquire great wealth, while

PROPHECIES OF GREAT CHANGES COMING
A new day is dawning; the long night Is spent, and the
day has now come when God's Kingdom, will become a
reality on the earth plane. It has been prophesied and
will be fulfilled. The world is passing through the throes
of a new birth. What has occurred in the past few years,
the world war, earthquakes, floods, etc., are minor occur­
rences compared to what is to take place in the next decade
or two. Hate, greed, national jealousies, .eta, hare be­
come too deep-rooted to reform. -Evil contains within, itself
the elements of its own destruction. Read this book and
learn what the prophets, seers and enlightened minds are
foreseeing. 32 page booklet, 25 cents. 5 copies for a dol­
lar. Sample copy of The Aquarian Age will be sent free
with each book.
