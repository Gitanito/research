  5/23/16    Atheist Debate  - Dr. Long debated two leading   atheists recently on the internet radio show 'Outer Limits of Inner Truth'. One   atheist was David Silverman, President of American Atheists   (https://atheists.org/). The other atheist was David I. Orenstein, Ph.D.,   Humanist Clergy and Atheist author and speaker. The American Humanist   Association recently appointed Dr. Orenstein as the organization's   representative to the United Nations. The show is at:      http://www.outerlimitsradio.com/death/ .

     &nbsp; A Remarkable Discussion of the  book:&nbsp;    Dying  to Live: Near-Death Experiences    by: Susan Blackmore, Ph.D.&nbsp;       A controversial title in the field   of near death studies is Susan Blackmore's Dying to Live. Dr. Blackmore   arrives at the conclusion that the near death experience is the product of a   dying brain, that the NDE does not support the existence of a spirit and an   afterlife. Some years ago, I wrote a critique of Dying to Live, taking   issue with both her approach and conclusions. This critique has a appeared on a   number of NDE related web sites. A recently-edited version is presented here.&nbsp;   Additional commentary by Dr. Jeff Long.&nbsp; (Article updated and republished   8/10/04)

He asserted this study &quot;delivered a blow&quot; to the idea that the mind and the brain could separate. Yet the researchers argued the exact opposite, and showed that conscious experience outside the body took place during a period of clinical death when the brain was   flatlined. As Jay Ingram, of the Canadian Discovery Channel, commented: &quot;His use of this study to bolster his point is bogus. He could have said, 'The authors think there's a mystery, but I choose to interpret their findings differently'. But he didn't. I find that very disappointing&quot; (Toronto Star, March 16, 2003). Here, Pim van Lommel sets out the evidence that Shermer misrepresented.

                           NDE...  Medically Explicable??? 
    
  Dr.  Jeff of NDERF was recently (12/16/01) interviewed on ABC News with Peter  Jennings (national TV) to discuss the article regarding NDE in the prominent  medical journal The Lancet.&nbsp;   This NDE article is discussed in more detail in a       Press  Release      already posted on NDERF.&nbsp;   Dr. Jeff defended The Lancet articles conclusion that NDE was not  medically explicable.&nbsp;  As  part of this ABC broadcast, another physician was briefly interviewed who  asserted that NDE was medically explicable.&nbsp;   Dr. Jeff e-mailed this physician a brief and partial list of reasons he  felt NDE was not medically explicable, and asked this physician to respond and  explain his position that NDE was medically explicable.&nbsp;   Three weeks have passed without a response from this physician.&nbsp;   This is unfortunate, as we welcome open and constructive debate on this  issue.&nbsp;  If he  responds at some future time, it is anticipated his comments will be posted on  this web site (if he is agreeable).&nbsp;   For the benefit of NDERF readers, attached is Dr. Jeff&#65533;s correspondence  regarding this issue.&nbsp;  This  correspondence is now an open letter to anyone willing to rationally respond and  defend the position that NDEs are medically explicable.&nbsp;  Click title above, or      click  here.  1/20/02.

  &quot;Boundary Detection  Kit&quot;       1. How    reliable is the source of the claim?

2. Does    this source often make similar claims?

3. Have    the claims been verified by another source?

4. How    does this fit in with what we know about the world    and how it works?

5. Has    anyone, including and especially the claimant, gone out of the way to disprove    the claim, or has only confirmatory evidence been sought?

6. In the    absence of clearly defined proof, does the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    preponderance of evidence converge to the claimants conclusion, or a different    one?

7. Is the    claimant employing the accepted rules of reason and tools of research, or have    these been abandoned in favor of others which lead to the desired conclusion?

8. Has    the claimant provided a different explanation for the observed phenomena, or    is it strictly a process of denying the existing    explanation?

9. If the    claimant has proffered a new explanation, does it account for as many    phenomena as the old explanation?

10. Do    the claimants personal beliefs and biases drive the conclusions, or vice    versa?    Copyright1999-2017 by Jody Long   and Jeffrey Long, MD
