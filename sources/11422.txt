We were heading home from the bar when he lost control of the vehicle and it rolled three times. My seatbelt busted and I was ejected.

I have no memory of the accident but what I do recall is floating outside my body. The backside of my body was to me. I felt something (what I know now was an angel) wrap around my arms and legs. I started being pulled back into my body when I was overwhelmed with the feeling of peace and calm. 

I knew that I was in an accident that I was protected and that I would survive. I suffered nineteen broken bones (all to the torso) and internal injuries. Not one limb was broke or scraped.
