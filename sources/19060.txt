well welcome to today&#39;s a workshop this
is going to be a focus on really what I
call the transdimensional Sciences of
the next millennium and it&#39;s dealing
essentially with where current knowledge
of science meets the science of
consciousness and contact experience and
puts all those things together so they
make sense to people and that&#39;s a really
big task because what you find normally
with this subject is that it goes as far
as do UFOs exist and people they want to
kick the tires on the UFOs
well first of all if they had tires and
that kind of landing gear it means it&#39;s
made by Lockheed Martin and my uncle&#39;s
old company Northrop Grumman and it&#39;s an
antigravity device secondly if it&#39;s only
in this dimension meaning 3-d or 4d if
you count count time time is 2/4 then it
is an interstellar so the first thing to
get your mind around is to forget
everything you know about conventional
wisdom if you&#39;ve studied the UFO subject
but also what you know about
conventional science because they&#39;re
both antiquated and have been purposely
kept antiquated I&#39;ll get into this in a
moment
dumb down what I want to do is share
what I think you and the public need to
know to understand what has been called
the phenomenon sort of this sort of meta
phenomenon of ET contact and UFO
phenomenon that goes beyond just the
fact that they&#39;re moving at a hundred
thousand miles per hour and can make a
right-hand turn without decelerating and
not kill the pilots on board with you
know a thousand g-forces or whatever
that would be because you know that&#39;s
all very interesting but it kind of begs
the question of if they&#39;re interstellar
how to get here and the fact that
they&#39;re here a priori they use something
that&#39;s beyond even post quantum physics
and is a little bit like going back to
Thomas Jefferson&#39;s era there&#39;s only a
couple 100 years ago and showing him
this thing a smartphone and there&#39;d be
no foundation for understanding this
this would be metaphysical so to the New
Age people they say well it&#39;s a
metaphysical thing also in metal is met
and what meta what what do you mean
metaphysical metaphysical is just a term
that people use when they don&#39;t quite
understand the science of a phenomenon
that&#39;s occurring there is no
metaphysical it&#39;s all level of
consciousness of where you&#39;re coming
from so if you&#39;re an advanced
civilization that&#39;s interstellar by
definition you&#39;re transdimensional so
you&#39;re dropping out of linear space-time
and then you&#39;re reappearing at another
point in space-time but not in a
straight line and the comprehension of
that requires a lot of humility on the
part of humans which we typically lack
but particularly scientists and
theologians we&#39;ll get to get to that a
little bit later there&#39;s people with
spiritual understanding because the the
paradigm is one of coming to work there
is this nexus where these what the
physicist Goswami described as the
self-aware universe comes together with
post quantum physics and way past spin
theory and string theory and where you
begin to be very cognizant of the fact
that these technologies that are
interstellar are operating from a level
of an understanding of the cosmos in
reality that is one where consciousness
and the mind is present at every level
even the 3d level because it&#39;s the only
thing that explains the phenomenon
and all the different manifestations so
I use this term TD is transdimensional
interstellar and so I just want to
introduce that right off the bat so TD
is is a term that I use for what we&#39;re
dealing with when we look at the science
of consciousness and the physics of how
the spacecraft move operate in our space
but also go from one star system to
another
and of course in the aerospace industry
they have more colorful terms for this I
was flying last year to Australia and I
was accidentally was put beside a man
going from Sydney to Brisbane who was a
northrop grumman engineer i said oh it&#39;s
my uncle&#39;s old company my uncle worked
on the lunar module the thing that
landed on the moon with no alarms wrong
in it and he says oh yeah that&#39;s clearly
cool and I said yeah I know he&#39;s a young
engineer and he said what are you doing
I said well I&#39;m here for a meeting he
says oh I hey I said kind of dealing
with some of the stuff that you may or
may not deal with and I just opened the
door a little bit so yeah we know what
that we call that pfm I said what he
said pure magic and so his words
not mine although I did repeat them
redact but uh-huh but that is why
there&#39;s called pfm but at the CIA is
called WS FM have you all heard this
term before the first time I heard it it
was from the science director guy who&#39;s
the one of the top guys in the science
Directorate CIA there&#39;s actually been
encouraged me to do what I&#39;ve been doing
for since 1992 because he can&#39;t because
it get assassinated so he says you do it
you get assassinated who cares and so so
they use this term WS FM sounds like a
radio station it stands for weird
science and freakin magic and that is
what they call this a Naval Research Lab
people call it that because what it
deals with is a type of phenomenon that
when you get into a certain level of
very high voltage systems where the
voltage is at a certain frequency in
resonant field I&#39;m not going to bore
people with the Arcana of this but let&#39;s
say you have a pointing vector or you
put an energy field with with very high
voltage around an object that&#39;s a couple
million volts very very low amperage so
there&#39;s not much power involved but it a
certain cycles per second or Hertz
resonant and in specific resonant field
that object can be made to literally
begin to resonate and then tilt out of
linear space-time and it will disappear
now I&#39;ve been in a lab that&#39;s run near
the Redstone Arsenal in Alabama
Huntsville where I this stuff has been
done and so by humans so but so it&#39;s
disappeared you can&#39;t see it and it
actually has moved into another
dimension dimension 6 10 12 89 whatever
it is someone asked me how many
dimensions are there I said how many
numbers are there between zero and
infinity okay so forget about eleven
dimensions or it keeps going so you know
it&#39;s like infinity goes back to infinity
or an get into this later
and so that science behind this has
really been studied somewhat
accidentally in the early days by
Faraday Maxwell Tesla and it was a sort
of an empiricist understanding you know
in joint empiricism is empiricism is
basically observational you know science
you you observe something it&#39;s empirical
it&#39;s tangible now you may not know the
theoretical behind it and this happens
in science all the time we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see
something and what we can describe the
phenomenon and even the parameters of
the science but we won&#39;t understand
really what it&#39;s doing we still really
understand how from the herb foxglove
digitoxin works to increase
contractile strength of the heart muscle
but it&#39;s been used for a hundred years
and it wasn&#39;t until very recently they
understood how aspirin worked which
respond that is the Barker from the bark
of a tree is where you get aspirin from
didn&#39;t understand how that really worked
and they still don&#39;t understand it all
of that works but it&#39;s key you can use
it and empirically see how it works but
the understanding unfolds over sometimes
decades centuries millennia so I&#39;m going
to be talking about areas of science
that is through a glass dimly and that
there&#39;s certain phenomenon that we can
observe but the actual full
understanding of it&#39;s probably going to
be unfolding over the next thousand five
thousand five hundred thousand years the
whole Nick&#39;s cycle we&#39;re in so that&#39;s
that&#39;s I want to set the stage there and
the other part of setting the stage is
the humility needed to sort approach in
a subject like this because the biggest
mistake people make is to think we know
everything I know everything because I&#39;m
a physicist at MIT well actually you
know not it&#39;s like the guy it&#39;s like the
guy who in the late 1800s declared that
we could close the Patent Office because
everything that could be invented had
been now this is a true story so you
know there&#39;s this hubris that goes with
the human condition that&#39;s rather
worrisome which has led to the
foolishness that we see today called
human society but but so to get past
that foolish way of thinking there has
to be a very open mind and also willing
to admit that we really don&#39;t understand
but a tiny fraction of the cosmos around
us and the brightest and best amongst us
in the working their whole lifetimes can
only unfold a little bit of it and so
from that foundation of sort of humility
then we can go and explore and if we
don&#39;t understand something you just file
it and say well someday we may
understand that
but don&#39;t discount it because there&#39;s
all of the things that are discounted
because it&#39;s not fitting into the box of
the current paradigm of science or
religion or thought that gets chucked
out and that&#39;s where the good stuff is
it&#39;s the really good stuff and often
people who do begin to explore those
things get persecuted like the
University of Rajabi have our farm out
near University of Virginia and there
was a medical doctor who discovered that
there was a bacterial h pylori that
causes a lot of the really bad bleeding
ulcers and it ran against the theory
that it was just too much acid and that
if you took a course of this and that
medicine instead of the acid medicine or
with it they would cure them without
surgery or anything he got run out of
the country ended up in Australia
Australia was only place he could get a
job he ended up getting the Nobel Prize
but it but the initial reaction of the
scientific fundamentalist paradigm the
high priests of science were to say no
it can&#39;t be because we know everything
about how this works what turns out they
didn&#39;t know anything about how ulcers
worked so the same is true in physics
the same is true in materials and the
same is true in theological thought and
consciousness studies so I think that&#39;s
why we have to sort of enter this whole
subject with that kind of perspective
then you can at least begin to explore
with with something resembling an open
mind and learn something the other thing
to understand is that almost everything
that I&#39;m going to talk about today has
been known in some classified project or
another for a very very long time but in
pieces maybe not put together the way
I&#39;m going to present it my job is to
sort of synthesize it and connect the
dots which is my job today is really to
connect all these dots for you guys so
that so that you leave here
understanding Wow
that&#39;s why an
Kraft does that or that&#39;s why I had this
experience in a contact moment or that&#39;s
what the future of energy and technology
is going to be and a deep understanding
now what I will try to avoid is too much
technical jargon Cosette sis&#39;s this is a
not a group of physicists but and I&#39;m
just the country doctor from Virginia
anyway so what sort of a void that&#39;s my
line I&#39;ve done things at the Pentagon
I&#39;m just a country doctor from Virginia
but you have to you know feel in your
heart that the knowledge can be
understood even if it&#39;s not in all the
technical aspects the concepts so if you
get the concepts then you can move into
what I call an operational paradigm and
the operational paradigm means that you
can put together the phenomenon you see
and your own experience and
consciousness and thought and do
something with it which of course the
outgrowth of that is the c5 Initiative
Close Encounters of the fifth kind where
humans use consciousness and thought to
interface with interstellar
communication systems and make contact
and that&#39;s that&#39;s the really exciting
stuff
