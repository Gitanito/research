  		          The Near-Death Experience
  What We Can Learn About Life After Death

  By Sharon Smith Kane

Among all the   possible topics of human conversation, there are some that we have been   culturally indoctrinated to avoid, presumably because they would too easily   incur animosity.&nbsp; One is politics, another is religion, and a third is   death.&nbsp; The last is taboo because it is, like the others, an emotionally charged   subject. Death is most often assumed to be the total end to our consciousness,   to our very existence. The churches teach us that it is the day of judgment; the   time when we'll be held accountable for our sins, and perhaps be sent to hell.   Because it is so avidly avoided as a topic of conversation, we fear to even   consider it, speak of it or contemplate it. It is the silent fear haunting all   our lives, the greatest of all fears, thought to be the most painful tragedy to   befall anyone. Death. Some even consider it to be a punishment from God.&nbsp;

Some of us will   seek death as an end to the pain and suffering of life, while others will risk   and even give their life for a cause they believe in.&nbsp; But most of us will   live our lives day by day, trying our best to preserve what we have of life and   avoid death. It is an uneasy truce because the fear is always lurking in the   back of our minds; a fear for ourselves, a fear for our loved ones, against &quot;The   Grim Reaper.&quot;&nbsp;

However, if our   curiosity can for a moment overcome our fear, we can listen to the stories of   those who have actually died --- and then returned --- to describe their   experience.&nbsp; There is nothing more believable than a first-hand account.&nbsp;

I did just this   and began reading the reports of near-death experiences by thousands of people   from all over the world which have been carefully documented by Jeffrey P. Long   MD and Jody A. Long JD&nbsp; of the Near Death Experience Research Foundation.&nbsp;

I was most     interested in the spiritual aspects of the experiences rather than the details     of the causes of death or the recovery process. It was the other worldly reality     that captured my attention, the spiritual entities encountered and the wisdom     and advice they imparted that I wanted most to know.&nbsp; Perhaps they could tell us   how best to live.&nbsp;

  Don't Be Afraid To Die &nbsp;

We're all going to   get there at some point, so wouldn't it be good to know what to expect?&nbsp; Yes,   you can know, or at least have a good idea, because there are those who have   died a clinical death and have come back to describe the experience.&nbsp;

One of the first   astonishing revelations they share is that it's actually not at all painful to   die.&nbsp; The trauma that precedes death may indeed be painful, but actual death is   a quick transition --- Zip!&nbsp; You're there.&nbsp;

Most people report   first seeing themselves floating above their body, viewing the scene of their   death from above.&nbsp; Surprisingly, they find themselves fully conscious, aware of   everything going on. They can see, hear and think with full mental faculties.   Strangely, however, their emotional reaction is one of detachment. They have no   concern for the body left behind and no longer even identify with it.&nbsp; Their   sense of self is now with the spiritual body, the conscious awareness which is   their essence apart from a physical body.&nbsp;

A whole new   experience now unfolds. As they turn their attention away from the scene of   their death, they become aware of another dimension.&nbsp; They move as if floating   and find themselves rising through what appears to be a tunnel or funnel-shaped   passageway, either velvety black or lit with colored lights. Next, a white light   becomes visible, sometimes at a distance, and this light seems to draw them to   it.&nbsp;

They describe this   White Light as having a brilliance beyond anything seen on Earth, yet with a   quality that does not hurt their eyes to observe.

Indeed it becomes   a Being Of Light that they may interpret to be a religious figure or a God-like   Being that enfolds them in unconditional love.&nbsp;

Let's look now at   people's reports as they describe the experience in their own words:&nbsp;

  Spiritual Aspects of Near-Death Experiences&nbsp;

2409&nbsp;&nbsp; The feeling   of lightness was truly incredible.&nbsp; It was such a relief to be outside my   body.....A place of pure love, glowing, ethereal beauty.&nbsp; Things were vividly   alive with energy. There is no religion there-- no separation based on religion.   &nbsp;I was to go back --- to help others understand and reclaim their spiritual   selves. &nbsp;&quot;It's not your time. You have things to do. You have to go back.&quot; &nbsp;

2401&nbsp;&nbsp; I was   encased in a warm glow, an ambiance that was so peaceful, with a wonderful   feeling of bliss and euphoria --- connected to a whole, I was home again.&nbsp; It   was magnificent and beautiful. I felt serene, peaceful and detached.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2386&nbsp; Amy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God   was &quot;the mind&quot;, or &quot;the order&quot; in all things.&nbsp; The Supreme Highest Vibration and   Frequency, an essence --- around and in everything --- all that is beautiful and   peaceful and One, and all that is good.&nbsp;

2380&nbsp; Deb:&nbsp;&nbsp; I was   enveloped in love, complete and unconditional love and compassion, as if I was   the most precious of children.&nbsp; A very powerful but totally loving Being.&nbsp;

2377&nbsp; Eric:&nbsp; There   was no judgement.&nbsp; Heaven --- was simply existing within a love beyond mortal   understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2332&nbsp; Guy:&nbsp;&nbsp; I had   a feeling of calm and warmth and pure peace. It was the most beautiful   experience, I was so at peace, it was like I was enveloped in pure love.&nbsp;

2331&nbsp; Shari:&nbsp;&nbsp; The   emotional feeling was one of complete freedom, contentment, happiness.&nbsp;

2330&nbsp;&nbsp; MHT:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Suddenly I felt a serene tranquility, everything is peaceful and calm. I have a   feeling of intense happiness.&nbsp;

2326&nbsp;&nbsp; Gail:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   felt as if I could stay there forever and need nothing--- that I could just be,   and need nothing else.&nbsp; Such calm.&nbsp; Such peacefulness. I wanted to stay.&nbsp;

2320&nbsp;&nbsp; Ron:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   experienced a grand soothing luminous energy --- a love-light shining.&nbsp;

2319&nbsp;&nbsp; Steven:&nbsp;&nbsp;   What I felt was &quot;the peace that surpasses all human understanding.&quot;&nbsp;

2318&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   felt wonderful, so light and free of everything physical.&nbsp; &nbsp;

2310&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   felt peace, tranquility, happiness, joy --- I felt safe, sure, in unity with   everything, a part of something immense.&nbsp;

2309&nbsp;&nbsp; Alberta:&nbsp;&nbsp;   It was so calming and filled with love.&nbsp; It was a thousand times better than the   love you experience on earth.&nbsp;

2308&nbsp;&nbsp;   Experiencing incredible peace, the absolute absence of any kind of fear.&nbsp;

2304&nbsp;&nbsp; The feeling   of love and peace was enormous..... Feeling the overwhelming love flood over   me.&nbsp;

2302&nbsp;&nbsp; Crystal:&nbsp;&nbsp;   I had this overwhelming understanding that EVERYTHING was exactly as it was   supposed to be --- everything that was or is ---- was just perfect.&nbsp;

2260&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Our purpose in life is to love.&nbsp;

2261&nbsp;&nbsp; Norbeto:&nbsp;&nbsp;   The overall feeling was of being part of a Great Whole, where what existed was   the Universe without stars, but where everything was light, joy, and love.&nbsp;

2239&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex (boy   of 11):&nbsp;&nbsp; I just kept floating up towards a blinding white light.&nbsp; The feeling   was so amazing.&nbsp; Like I did not have a care in the world.&nbsp; I felt like I was   made out of energy and air.&nbsp;

2206&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathy:&nbsp;&nbsp; As   I approached the light I felt myself unfold like a flower, although I had no   body.&nbsp; The love I felt was like nothing I have ever experienced before.&nbsp; I was   enveloped by this light and felt one with everything, all seeing, all knowing.&nbsp;   &quot;God is love&quot; -- the love was like an energy that connected every molecule in   the universe.&nbsp;

2196&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacque:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   feel an intense well-being, a sense of wonder in an immaterial world, exalting   and serene, that seems to function according to superior values, entirely   unknown in the Earth world.&nbsp; I can melt into it, I already belong.&nbsp;

2194&nbsp;&nbsp; Gayle:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Surrounding me was the presence of warm radiant light; it was holding me,   comforting me, loving me, enclosing me in perfect rapture, an area of pure   soothing brilliant golden white light. I was totally at peace.&nbsp;

2159&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark:&nbsp;&nbsp; One   with the music.&nbsp; There was more ecstasy with the music than any one single human   could tolerate. I felt more &quot;awake&quot; than I had ever felt, as if this earthly   life was but a dream and true consciousness happens after death.&nbsp;

2158&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert:&nbsp;&nbsp;   &quot;Every act of kindness matters.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;

2100&nbsp;&nbsp; Bobby:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   was free of the body --- free of the daily stress of a physical existence.&nbsp; I no   longer felt fear or loneliness, or emotional pain.&nbsp; There are no human   words available to describe this.&nbsp; It was a total emersion in God's love, in his   light, in the presence of Christ himself --- immersed in the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; It   was the most beautiful thing that I have ever experienced in my life.&nbsp; It was   not physical.&nbsp; It was 100% spiritual.&nbsp; As this was going on I had no   sadness or did I miss anyone or anything I was leaving behind.&nbsp; It was as if I   was also immersed in total understanding and knowledge of all things ---- there   was no concept of time or space --- only pure love and infinite wisdom, untold   forgiveness and acceptance.&nbsp;

2081&nbsp;&nbsp; Debbie:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   thought at the Light, &quot;Oh no, not yet, I'm not ready yet!&quot;&nbsp; At the same time I   felt as though I knew everything I had ever wanted to know and more at that   young age (5).&nbsp; I knew that whatever happened in this life, it was all okay.&nbsp; It   was all just experiences, good or bad.&nbsp; The feeling of complete unconditional   love was so very strong.&nbsp; I knew I belonged with it and I would be back with it,   so I chose to go back to my body.&nbsp;

2076&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   began reliving my life --- and experiencing every action as everyone affected by   my actions --- I affect John, John affects Ray, Ray affects Sam--- etc. Every   thought, every action, every word are connected, like a vast web of stars that   existed in many dimensions.&nbsp;

2068&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandra:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   was very calm and began to move very slowly upwards and it was more and more   beautiful into an infinity of light and peace, happiness.&nbsp; I knew I was going to   heaven or somewhere very beautiful.&nbsp; I did not want to come back at this point   as it was the most happy I had ever been in my life.&nbsp; I felt so loved.&nbsp;

2759&nbsp;&nbsp; Gina:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Life is a school, nothing more.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2064&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynne:&nbsp;&nbsp;   When you are out of your body you are pure love and only make decisions with the   purest intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are totally unselfish. &nbsp;

2029&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert:&nbsp;&nbsp;   As I felt the light engulf me I could feel all the problems, anger, fear and any   other negative emotion just lift out of my body.&nbsp; I instantly knew the light was   pure goodness and love, like nothing I had ever felt before or since.&nbsp; It was   such a feeling of peace and love. &nbsp;

2010&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley:&nbsp;&nbsp;   The feeling of happiness and complete understanding of everything of Earth was   known in a flash.&nbsp; I was home, really home, nothing of Earth was present, just   me and information entering my mind.&nbsp; A great feeling of &quot;I made it home at   last.&quot;&nbsp;

1986&nbsp;&nbsp; Bart:&nbsp;&nbsp;   There was an overwhelming feeling of joy and peace.&nbsp; Time didn't exist. &nbsp;

1983&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott:&nbsp;&nbsp;   All of a sudden all of the pain and agony ended.&nbsp; My spiritual body felt no   pain, but only relief and peace.&nbsp; I felt free and liberated.&nbsp;

1982&nbsp;&nbsp; Elisa:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   drifted in the light with God ---- He reminded me of my home and the reality   that really exists and the beauty behind all of it is so indescribable and   amazing --- Heaven truly is my home --- this Earth is very temporary and time is   simply an illusion to further understand being human.&nbsp;

1948&nbsp;&nbsp; Geralyn:&nbsp;&nbsp;   During this, I began rising, and all at once it seemed as though I knew   everything there was to know.&nbsp; It seemed as if all the mysteries of the world   were being revealed.&nbsp; I understood science, math, life! &nbsp;

1936&nbsp;&nbsp; Bobbie:&nbsp;&nbsp;   The greatest emphasis of this experience is LOVE.&nbsp; You are so totally engulfed   with a love that does not exist in our physical world. No matter how deep a love   you feel for your children, it does not compare with this love.&nbsp; This love is   the purist, truest, deepest, totally unconditional love that you could EVER   imagine.&nbsp; It knocks your socks off. When you receive this love, it is not   comprehended with your mind.&nbsp; It is FELT by your soul.&nbsp; And that immense feeling   of this perfect love shoots straight into your heart, as a feeling that you   experience. It can bring your soul to its knees. It is totally overwhelming in   the best way imaginable. &nbsp;

1913&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Time really didn't exist there --- there was no sound ---&nbsp; I remember I could   see --- I could look in all directions.&nbsp; I was missing my earthly body.&nbsp; I   remembered nothing of my earthly self, or even that I had ever existed before   now.&nbsp;

1892&nbsp;&nbsp; Jody:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   remember seeing this bright beautiful light --- there is nothing on Earth I can   compare it to... It was the most welcoming and beautiful feeling I ever had.&nbsp; I   felt so incredibly free and I was intensely happy and felt no need of anything.&nbsp;   There was no sense of time.&nbsp; I just knew I never wanted to leave this sense of   peace and wellbeing.&nbsp; One thing is for sure, I was NOT dead!&nbsp; I was more alive   than I had ever been before.&nbsp;

1890&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   knew that this presence was all powerful and knew everything and that everything   would always be alright no matter what happened ever....&nbsp; I asked, &quot;Why is there   so much pain down there (on Earth)?&quot;&nbsp; The answer was laughter ---&nbsp; &quot;Don't you   know I have the power to take away all the pain?&nbsp; The pain is left behind on   Earth.&nbsp; It does not travel with us but the lessons we learn from it are   eternal.&quot;&nbsp;

1873&nbsp;&nbsp;   Christopher:&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt complete peace, no worries about anything, and it was one   of the greatest experiences of my life.&nbsp;

1862&nbsp;&nbsp; Adaline:&nbsp;&nbsp;   I was in this beautiful glowing place.&nbsp; I wanted to stay. This Other Side was   unexplainable in words.&nbsp; Too peaceful, too overwhelming, I was overpowered with   so much love.&nbsp; I felt enamored, whole and complete, nothing to do with this   world.&nbsp; It was my best experience in my whole life. The moment I step in the   Other Side I felt the immense love all around me, also I knew I belonged there.&nbsp;

1861&nbsp;&nbsp;   Catherine:&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard God's voice ---- His voice was an ACTING energy power ---   My consciousness was clear, kind of acute, this is a hyperconsciousness, ultra   clear --- understanding and perceiving the TRUTH. This consciousness ENCOMPASSES   ALL, just all.&nbsp; This is INSTANT consciousness. Communication is by telepathy ---   God placing TRUTHS in our mind --- in our spirit. &nbsp;

1860&nbsp;&nbsp; Cora:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   saw a glowing point light up, growing bigger.&nbsp; It came through the closed window   into my room and embraced me completely.&nbsp; Then all went quiet inside me and all   I felt was a warm love, peace and happiness. For a long time I have longed for   that feeling of love.&nbsp;

1845&nbsp;&nbsp; Vickey:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   felt perfectly normal.&nbsp; I was floating above my own body and the sensation was   euphoric, it was a feeling of perfection in the highest form.&nbsp; I was completely   weightless, and hovering over my body in complete bliss.&nbsp; At the same time it   was as though all questions of the universe had been answered in that one   moment.&nbsp;

1839&nbsp;&nbsp; John:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   just felt, from that wonderful face, that I was both welcome and expected;   exactly as if I had seen that face before, and much more --- As if everything   was so well-known, so familiar and so self-evident.&nbsp; Nearly as if I had been   away in a long, long journey in a foreign country, and after a time I finally   had come back again!&nbsp; Home, where everything was so well-known and safe.&nbsp; I felt   the exuberant joy of returning home, of being able to come back.&nbsp;

1828&nbsp;&nbsp; Chen:&nbsp;&nbsp; He   was bright, warm and gentle.&nbsp; He could answer every question.&nbsp; He surrounded me   and guided me.&nbsp; He revealed everything of the universe.&nbsp; I felt complete relief   from pain and suffering.&nbsp; I felt the existence of everlasting harmony and   happiness.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Everything is moving, there is no death, there is no   birth, everything is just cycling eternally --- this is the truth of the   universe.&quot; &nbsp;

1817&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda:&nbsp;&nbsp; My   Savior ----&nbsp; I shall never forget his eyes.&nbsp; They were dark and so full of   love.&nbsp; I know he knew everything about me --- every thought, every act I had   ever done, everything, totally everything about me. I felt no fear at all.&nbsp; Just   the strongest love I have ever felt from anyone anywhere in my entire   existence.&nbsp; That love was real and sort of wrapped me up and cuddled me.&nbsp;

1806&nbsp;&nbsp; Suzy:&nbsp;&nbsp; A   formless presence from inside the light told me that I needed to live.&nbsp; They   expressed that I had an important purpose to fulfill for the Earth that was   vital to the Divine plan for our world.&nbsp; They instructed me on how to bring   myself back --- I was to pull the light into myself and use its power to   re-manifest and strengthen my physical being.&nbsp;

1797&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl:&nbsp; I   was standing before Christ.&nbsp; He showed me my whole life, the good and the bad   and all the rest.&nbsp; He said, &quot;That is all right, life is a learning experience.&quot;&nbsp;   To tell all:&nbsp; &quot;You must learn to love all that is around you.&quot;&nbsp;

1785&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   was told that God would be available to me back on Earth if I asked.&nbsp; &quot;I am   there too, it is you who closed the door between us.&quot;&nbsp;

1757&nbsp;&nbsp; Carry:&nbsp;&nbsp;   The being of light said, &quot;Carry, I love you just the way you are.&quot;&nbsp; I felt like   the most loved human being of all time, the most favorite of all human beings in   the universe ---&nbsp; yet I knew at the same time this being loved everyone equally   and just as infinitely as I felt right then. The being delighted in me and was   completely focused on me, I was the center of its attention and yet somehow I   knew everyone was at the center of its attention.&nbsp; It saw me as I was, faults   and all, and at all the moments of my life.&nbsp; It was so liberating to be known so   perfectly, to be so wonderfully accepted, yet at the same time, not judged or   condemned in the slightest way.&nbsp;

2433&nbsp;&nbsp; Cara:&nbsp;&nbsp;   Death came as a surprise.&nbsp; Outside the physical world entirely, outside of time   and space.&nbsp; Enveloped in the Light.&nbsp; I felt unconditional love, peace and joy to   an extent beyond anything that can be experienced here.&nbsp; I was one with the   Light.&nbsp; I was whole.&nbsp; I was home.&nbsp;

No bad or evil   exists there.&nbsp; There is no pain, no hunger, no thirst, no suffering, no   struggle, no baggage, no illness.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were all one with each other and with the   Light in perfect holy communion with the Light.&nbsp;

1547&nbsp;&nbsp; Teri:&nbsp;   There is life after this body dies, and it goes on forever as there is no   time.&nbsp;&nbsp; All life on Earth is connected mentally.&nbsp; We are in a cocoon-like state   here in these bodies, and when the body dies, the cocoon opens and we are free.&nbsp;   We become our beautiful butterfly selves as we were intended.&nbsp; There is a plan,   it is all extremely organized, like a very complex mathematical equation.&nbsp; I   knew everything but I can't remember anything else.&nbsp;

  Near Death Experiences - Meaningful Excerpts: &nbsp;

Christopher J NDE.   (A young boy) 7/28/08&nbsp; A guy's voice asked me if I'm okay, and I slowly lowered   my arms and looked up. I was standing in the middle of a meadow, rolling hills   and beautiful flowers dotted the area. I could see cottages in the distance. A   song more beautiful than any I have ever heard was playing in the background,   with no visible source. The very air emanated love and warmth, a love that goes   deep into the soul and can withstand anything. The guy called me by name and I   turned around. The man was barely out of his twenties, blond, longish hair, blue   eyes, dressed in the whitest clothing I have ever seen. (Later, I learned that   angels were clothed in light, which explains his clothes.) He towered over me; I   only rose to his navel area. He told me that I wasn't supposed to be here,   looking down on me with love and concern. I asked him why, and he said I had a   LONG time to go before I could enter heaven to stay. I wondered how long   silently, and he answered me as if he heard what I was thinking.&nbsp; &quot;You are   supposed to be 83 years old before you get here.&quot;&nbsp; I heard someone say that   I had arrived at a parallel universe at a HIGHER LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS where it   was possible to see other people living normally upon the earth.&nbsp; That was a   great revelation.&nbsp; The secret to the universe was being presented to me.&nbsp; The   secret is: there is another world where things really are real, where truth,   goodness and harmony exist.&nbsp; Life is not limited to the earth experience.&nbsp; Earth   life is only a small part of the whole.&nbsp; Those who earn the right are shown   eternal life.&nbsp; That was the essence.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Cara:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I   had a sense of all knowing...a knowledge of the past, present and future...the   big picture...universal order and purpose.&nbsp; I know that everything is very   well choreographed. Nothing is by chance.&nbsp; There are no coincidences.   Although everything is well planned, we have a choice as to how we use the   information. Everyone whose path we cross, for example, crosses our path for a   reason. We have the choice to disregard the individual and the experience, and   we have the choice to be open to the possibilities offered with the interaction.   We have the choice to live every moment being aware and totally in the moment,   or we can choose not to be totally in the moment, which a lot of folks do in our   society.&nbsp;

1744&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kristy C   NDE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember being pulled backwards and when I turned I was in an earthy   tunnel and a door was before me that opened into a spectacular light. The light   was brilliant, but it did not hurt! As I passed into it, it glowed with warmth,   love, knowledge, &amp; understanding. Not just my own knowledge but knowledge of   everything complete understanding, collective but separate. Everything made   sense. Everything was more vivid the colors were brighter &amp; deeper, everything   was tranquil and at peace the moment I crossed into the light. I was now   standing in a lush rolling meadow, covered with blooms &amp; trees. I felt a   presence strong and even more wonderful; I knew my family was with me. The   presence had a deep resonating voice that touched the core of your soul. I don't   remember what the voice told me, but the peace &amp; calm seemed to magnify. I   remember sitting in the meadow, I was cradling something in my arms, asking to   cross a small free flowing stream, and not being allowed, I asked to stay. I did   not want to go back.

I came to   understand that we all choose to come to earth to fulfill a plan of some sort or   even learn about a particular interest. We choose our bodies and parents and   life plan. May I also add that some people come here for the most simplest of   reasons to learn how to play tennis for example or simply for the cake and food,   as silly as this sounds our life plans aren't so high and lofty as one might   think. I DIDN'T MEET ANY SAVE THE WORLDERS OR ANYONE WISHING TO BE A PRESIDENT.   MOST HAD SIMPLE WISHES. I was also told we could exist on different planes for   another lives but our life here on earth is a life purely to experience physical   pleasure or pain but to have a physical experience because all other planes we   don't need a body as a vessel. I also learnt that this life here is just a drop   of water in the bucket of lives in which we all experience, many here on Earth &amp;   many in other realms of existence. All to progress and grow in some way. The   main purpose here is to LOVE. I was also told that this would be my last life   here on Earth as there will be nothing left for me to learn by coming here   again. I had the feeling though that I'd be off to some other magical place!&nbsp;

3737&nbsp; Shirley R   NDE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the light, that is not really a light like we know on earth,   I felt I finally was home after a long long journey. Every question I ever   wanted to know about the universe and life was answered at that moment and not a   word was spoken, but I could feel the information enter my soul. There were   silhouettes of women and men and children floating up at an angle through a fog   like light. All were looking up at an angle and I was watching them and waiting   for what seemed like my turn, I was filled with happiness and safety and love,   everything we the people look for and seek out here on earth. I still cry to go   home into the light, I do not want to be here on earth anymore, but know that I   have no choice not even suicide. &nbsp;

&nbsp;1734&nbsp;&nbsp;   Cathleen:&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew that He had the answers to all questions so I began to ask   Him things I had wondered about the most. Why is there evil? His reply, because   there is good. I asked how anyone, being what they are, be permitted to exist in   this home of God. He made me understand that He knew everything about me, that I   was who I was because He Himself had designed me to be exactly, precisely who I   was and that whatever I was I was still His creation, His child and He loved me   so very much.&nbsp;

1523&nbsp;&nbsp; Jean:&nbsp;&nbsp; I   began having ... with total awareness .... a life review.&nbsp; It was as if   living the actual life of other people and feeling the consequences of my   actions on them.&nbsp; Everything I had done in my life had consequences, and these   were felt and lived by me, causing me to feel profound sadness, repentance and   pain which I will never forget.&nbsp; It was a fearful and unpleasant experience.&nbsp;   I also realize for the first how beautiful and fragile Earth really is. I could   sense the earth breathing like it was alive. I could see a light around   everything that was alive, trees, flowers, grass, animals, volcanoes and   humans.&nbsp; I sense that humans was in control over other living things, I have the   word (aura) stamped in mind ever since. Don't no why but the angel told me not   tell anyone and that time will reveled itself.&nbsp;

Curtis K NDE.&nbsp;&nbsp; As   I was losing hold on my life, I felt sorry for myself as I began to let go. I   felt was dying poorly. A kind of darkness, came over me and I experienced a   grayish dark void of infinite nothingness. I had no fear at this point. I had no   concept of time or relationships to time or of moments passing. It was a very   unusual feeling to say the least, not what we normally experience in the   everyday reality of our lives. I felt myself becoming more and more aware,   self-aware. I had feelings of expanding awareness, becoming everything known   experiencing everything yet to be known. As this was happening, everything I had   been taught, everything I believed in, everything I ever learned or thought   throughout the course of my lifetime, fell away from me as if they never held   meaning in the first place. This felt ok to me, I had no fear.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Alan M NDE.&nbsp;   There is a beautiful balance to existence, while the dark void is awful, the   domain of the light is so peaceful, loving, glorious even blissful that I can   not really find adequate words in the English language to describe it. Therefore   we all have varying degrees of light in us that will allow us into the glorious   light of almighty.&nbsp; We meet an essence of God in the light end of the tunnel, at   the end of our earthly life. God can work with the light in us, make us pure and   allow us to progress up the various levels of heaven into his eternal blissful   presence of everlasting peace and joy! It is a progress of eternal learning.   Then we become one with God, but retain our unique. Self awareness or our unique   personalities are retained forever.&nbsp;

1511&nbsp; &nbsp;Murray:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Then I was inside the light ..... I had the feeling of an intense love and   acceptance and that everything would be alright.&nbsp; Next I heard a very deep,   majestic male voice ask, &quot;What have you done with your life?&quot;&nbsp; I saw my life as   a panorama, while being able to see it in its entirety simultaneously.&nbsp; I didn't   feel too good with what I saw.&nbsp; The voice, once again asked, &quot;What have you done   with your life?&quot;&nbsp; This time it sounded more stern and angry.&nbsp; All I could say   was, &quot;Nothing.&quot;&nbsp;

Sharon B's message   from God:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember seeing beautiful pink and golden clouds with crystal   blue sky beneath them.&nbsp; It was like the rays of the sun were coming out from   them and I was wrapped within them.&nbsp; I felt so safe and so secure and such   incredible peace like I have never felt before.&nbsp; Below me there was a beautiful   garden with flowers of every color and a stream running through it.&nbsp; I heard   gorgeous music that was so soothing. It was like being rocked and cared for like   I was a little child again.&nbsp; God was with me, I felt Him so deeply ... He was   holding me in his arms.&nbsp; I felt this very clearly and His love was within every   fiber of my being and every cell of my body.&nbsp; He was in front of me, in back of   me, beside me, all around me.&nbsp; All I felt was His total acceptance of me with   absolutely no judgement at all.&nbsp; He is all love, completely love, and he   showered that love totally on me and through me.&nbsp; I felt so complete and whole   for the first time in my entire existence.&nbsp; I had a life review which just   seemed to happen all on its own.&nbsp; This lasted but a blink of an eye and the   lesson in the reviewing process is that we judge ourselves, God does not judge   us.&nbsp;

The messages were   very clear...What you put into this universe, you will get back. Be very careful   what words, thoughts and actions you put out into the universe because they&nbsp;   most definitely will come back to you in some form at some point in your life.   This He told me to bring back and share.&nbsp;

  Common Elements and Wisdom Gathered&nbsp;

Most people, upon   encountering death, have an initial sensation of entering a tunnel or funnel   which can be totally black, or have shades of grey, or be colored with   multicolor lights. They become aware of a light in the distance which draws them   to it. As they approach it, it becomes larger and more luminous, a brilliant   white or golden white light, more incredible than anything seen on Earth, and   ultimately it encompasses them entirely and engulfs them in love. This light is&nbsp;   interpreted as a spiritual being, god-like or Christ-like, and with the meeting   comes an overwhelming experience of peace, comfort, freedom, joy, bliss and   unconditional love.&nbsp;

In short order,   the next experience is &quot;The Life Review&quot;, in which we see in quick succession,   scenes as on a movie or TV screen, every event of our entire life. We see how we   behaved or reacted to every experience, and how our behavior affected those   around us. We not only observe it, we experience it.&nbsp; Not only from our own   perspective, but from the perspective of the other people around us. This is   where we sit in judgment on our own behavior.&nbsp;

In being born into   a material world we give up our consciousness of where we came from and only   fully recover it when we depart.&nbsp; Meanwhile our own spirit and conscience guide   us through life with the help of the spirit of those around us: our parents,   families, teachers, friends and even enemies.

Although we may be   completely unaware of it, in addition to the earthly helpers we have those in   the spirit world assisting when asked:&nbsp; guides, guardian angels, deceased   friends and relatives, standing by, watching over us.&nbsp; Even so, our own free   will holds precedence.

Our purpose: we   come into this world to gather EXPERIENCE, which makes us each UNIQUE.&nbsp; Life is   about having experience, good, bad or whatever.&nbsp; Life is a school, a matter of   learning lessons. The more we learn, the easier it becomes.&nbsp; We are learning   lessons as individuals and also as part of a group.&nbsp; The group can be racial or   national or religious or cultural or anything relating to the era in which we   live.&nbsp;

Our life is a gift   and we must value it as such.&nbsp; Suicide is not an option.&nbsp;

We agree, before   being born, to perform certain deeds in the forthcoming life. It's a contract   that we are bound to honor. If we fail to do so, we come back again in another   life to try again.&nbsp;

We are meant to   contribute love to the world in one way or another. We may be asked, &quot;What have   you done to help your fellow man?&quot; A voice may be masculine or feminine,   resounding or gentle, heard in our head or heard just intuitively, but the   message is clear.&nbsp;

Each one of us is   loved deeply and unconditionally by a totally loving God.

GOD IS LOVE   becomes profoundly understood in the depths of our being.&nbsp;

We are eternal. As   a part of God we are forever. Love is eternal. We can never lose someone we   love. We may be separated for a time but will always reunite eventually.   Sometimes the separation is part of the lessons we have chosen for a lifetime, a   need to strengthen ourselves through learning independence.&nbsp;

The reason for   evil in the world is that otherwise we would not know good.

We are in a world   of opposites because it serves as a learning tool.&nbsp; We know one thing because we   have experienced its opposite, or its absence.&nbsp; We have chosen to enter a   material world and learn lessons because ultimately it strengthens and enriches   and develops our soul.&nbsp;

Every person,   animal, bird, beast and plant is a part of God.&nbsp; We are all one and what each   one does affects the whole.&nbsp;

Every thought,   word, deed, action or inaction of ours has an effect on others.&nbsp; We must be   careful that all our words and actions have a positive and loving intent. &quot;Do no   harm.&quot;&nbsp;

Never miss an   opportunity to help someone along the way, and take no thought of reward.&nbsp;

There is no   judgment in heaven. There is no punishment, no reward.&nbsp; We judge ourselves. In   the life review we must feel the effects of our actions on all others we have&nbsp;   encountered.&nbsp; Their feelings become our own.&nbsp;

Our life has   meaning and purpose.&nbsp; Our death comes when we have fulfilled a purpose or   commitment, a task, a goal. It may be as simple as raising a child, perfecting a   relationship with someone, overcoming a handicap. Or again it may be a life that   affects huge numbers of people, or animals, or the Earth itself.&nbsp;

If we meet an   untimely death, or come close to death before our time, we can only proceed so   far on the other side before we meet a barrier: a gate, a wall, a bridge, a   stream to be crossed. Perhaps a&nbsp; spiritual entity or deceased relative will   lovingly block our way and tell us:&nbsp; &quot;It's not your time.&quot; &quot;You must go back.&quot;&nbsp;   &quot;You have more to do.&quot; &quot;There are people who need you.&quot; or &quot;&quot;You haven't done   what you were intended to do with your life.&quot; Or it may be our own conscience   that calls us back. We have children or family members who would suffer if we   died.&nbsp;

Sometimes we are   given a choice: to pass over or to return: &quot;If you come any closer you will not   be able to return.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;It's your choice.&quot;&nbsp;

In most cases the   choice is difficult because once entering the next world we are immediately   swept up into the most exquisite peace, bliss, comfort and love we have ever   known.&nbsp; All physical and emotional pain are left behind, all worries, cares and   fears vanish completely. We are safe, secure and joyfully happy. We are in a   world of wondrous beauty, free to go where ever we like.&nbsp; Other spiritual beings   greet us warmly, welcoming us like long lost friends and beloved family.&nbsp; Our   consciousness expands to include all knowledge and understanding.&nbsp; All questions   are answered. We are held in total acceptance by the most incredible loving   presence we could ever imagine.&nbsp; It is perfection beyond our loftiest dreams.&nbsp;   All this must be given up to return to a physical body.&nbsp;

Is it any wonder   that those who do return declare that they no longer have any fear of death.&nbsp; In   fact they are assured that there is no death, and that we will only be truly   alive when we enter the next world.&nbsp; It is, as many state, &quot;like coming home.&quot;&nbsp;

So, in conclusion,   if we think this life is all there is, we're sadly (or happily) mistaken. This   life isn't even our real life. It's a a little dream, a fantasy, a made-up   story, a side-trip taken to enrich our soul. After this we return to our real   life. Of course we have to believe that this life is all there is for us to take   it seriously. Otherwise it wouldn't work to change us, to add to the evolvement   of our soul.&nbsp;We couldn't be allowed to see that this life is only a game, while   our real life, the one we never could believe existed while we were encased in a   physical body and immersed in a material world, was awaiting our return.&nbsp;   That life would seem too good to be true to the &quot;realistic&quot; human mind and the   &quot;down-to-earth&quot; human psyche.&nbsp; Strange that everything we take to be solid and   real is actually artifice, and the things that we think are pure fantasy and   imagination and wishful dreaming are closer to the reality.&nbsp; &quot;Too good to   be true&quot; is, after all, true. In the next world that is, not in this one.    </body>
