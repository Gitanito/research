I was in the United States Army for two
years drafted and then I got out of the
military went to college and graduated
in 1963 in a BS EE degree since then I
have been in a graduate program for
nuclear engineering also I&#39;ve taken
pre-med and I&#39;ve been working contracts
since 1963 also for NASA Department of
Energy and several other electronic
firms in the Washington DC area
in 1957 259 I was mostly in outside of
all in the Maryland just north of
Washington DC at a Nike Ajax missile
facility I was a radar operator in May
of 1958 about 6 a.m. and the reason I
knew it was six is because that&#39;s when
everybody got up I looked out the window
first I heard his sound it sound like a
pulsating transformer I looked out the
window and looked across the field and
saw this object heading towards the
ground in saw crash broke apart and then
it took off again in flight I
immediately got dressed went up under
the hill where the radar was got a
telescope that we tracked the North Star
with two liner and radar antennas and
sat and mounted on that radar and looked
at the pieces that were laying across
the field in the largest piece that I
saw which was actually glowing white-hot
it was a probably the size of a washing
machine shortly thereafter the Air Force
personnel had arrived going across this
field and started picking up these
pieces now they use long poles very long
poles to pick up the biggest piece and
they proceeded to put it on a truck that
was lead line truck and pushed it in
with another long pole and got it inside
the truck itself then the other
personnel picked up the other pieces
that were laying about
now what&#39;s interesting about it is the
from my knowledge of nuclear things now
my recalled that these personnel were
wearing radiation suits protective suits
and then he proceeded to take the
material &#39;we have no idea where it went
the other issue there was that when the
craft took off again after crashed it
went through a grove of trees which it
actually sheared three four or five inch
limbs and just one fell swoop or like a
knife or a machete well that wasn&#39;t the
real exciting part the real exciting
part happened the next evening while I
was on duty and it was approximately
10:00 11:00 at night and I got a call
from the Gaithersburg facility saying
that they had ten Earl Ansari twelve to
fifteen UFOs fifty to 100 feet off the
ground
so I asked the guy who was on the radio
with me I said what did they sound like
he took his head mic off put it out the
van window and again the pulsating sound
except there were more of them and he
was describing them and in different
shapes and so forth I had the radar on
the m33 radar sweep radar and I found
the right next to the ground clutter or
Gaithersburg sets we found the Fonda
blip where these so vehicles were and
then all of a sudden they all took off
at the same time and for my radar scope
it went one sweep it&#39;s a 33 and a third
rpm to go that distance from the center
out to where I got the next blip in the
first sweep at a constant velocity would
have to be 17,000 miles an hour which we
calculated from our analog computer
here&#39;s probably its
in excess of 30 feet in diameter yet it
had circular balls appeared on the outer
rim up close to a cake-like
fixture on top and that&#39;s banned there
were different colors there were orange
and red and and some yellow but they
were pulsating so I mean it it was quite
a sight to see as it was wobbling
towards the earth and hip and it came in
a fairly rapid rate how far away was it
from where it cracked well it came down
it came actually over top of the
barracks
so I actually saw the tail end of where
it crashed it was approximately 2,000
yards and the reason I know that is
because of paralleled the launch pad
which is 2,000 yards away there was one
individual on guard duty who actually
saw it come in and went over top of him
in the guard shack was just a few yards
away from them bearings and he saw that
actually come down and crash all the way
from from when he person when it first
appeared but you said the retrieval was
apparently by Air Force the Air Force
yes it was outside the fences of the
target trailer the Tong radar area and
also the launch pad so I was in the
civilian air but it landed in his
person&#39;s cornfield in fact the farmer
was actually standing there washing his
hands when he saw it crash and take off
again it&#39;s near Mount Zion Maryland it&#39;s
just in the other side of Mount Zion
going east I do know that the article
hit the New York Times the next day 58
May 58 directive came down not to
mention this to anybody anyway but of
course by this time was already out in
these papers what did occur was when I
tracked the next night I tracked those
vehicles of taking off there was a
question as to what they really were in
the in the general came back and said
those were helicopters and they were in
doing some Navy Army Air Force maneuvers
that was had we all had a big laugh
about that one that was the cover story
used yes and obviously there were other
area other people had radars on t they
actually saw those go off also I had
another one which I can&#39;t say too much
about I can&#39;t say where I was I was at a
facility in California that&#39;s all I can
say and I was doing particular
classified work set aside from what was
actually happening there it was a
completely different scenario the only
thing I can say is it was it was
occurring at the same time that our
astronauts were doing a loop around the
moon and back again on their trip to the
to that moon or to the moon itself
I heard the expression of the bogey
coming in 11 o&#39;clock a familiar with
that particular term I perked my ears
and started listening a little bit and
discovered that Houston and the
astronauts were talking back and forth
about a collision and the astronauts
asked for permission to do avoidance for
collision and Houston finally granted
that permission to do that and after the
after the comlinks settled down a little
bit they have some not said it&#39;s not
necessary they are now paralleling our
course and there was the discussion as
to what was paralleling that course
there was another type of ship there
were portals there that they could see n
they could see beings of some sort they
did not describe these beings that just
took photographs and after a while a few
thousand miles and then they took off
from the capsule that they were flying
in and went away
they just said with saucer-like
officer like crap crafts house that was
paralleling their fam actually parallel
in their craft and it was just far
enough away they couldn&#39;t really
distinguish they saw movement they saw
something something things somebody
moving inside there and inside that ship
says before the landing yes it was
probably in 68 67 maybe someone in that
time frame all they said was they there
they go and they went out of sight
almost immediately from there from there
conversation it was unedited because of
the for I was very extremely restricted
channel as a matter of fact when I was
doing work at NASA I got into the NASA
library looking for the tapes never did
find them there was only one gentleman
there that said I shouldn&#39;t know easy
said like you didn&#39;t hear anything and I
said hear what that was into that in
fact the gentleman&#39;s registered I was
even there for what I was doing a bogey
is when you&#39;re when you&#39;re flying is is
an object coming in and normally during
world war ii they use those and also
korean war as a term for potential enemy
craft approaching and if they don&#39;t know
the aircraft type they call it a bogey
approximately halfway to the moon on the
way to on the way to the moon
their reactions were so much stoic I
mean no big thing and then go wow look
at that look what I&#39;m seeing no nothing
like that at all they just said the
bogeys next to us and they&#39;re flying
very professional not surprising I don&#39;t
know what instrumentation they
particularly had but they knew that
their course were they were going to
intersect no question about it
so they must had some device that would
tell them
it&#39;s obvious in space I wouldn&#39;t imagine
very good Turkish friends went scuba
diving with him and other things he
would talk about the eastern part of
Turkey as being a great UFO place
I just asked in pointless what do you
mean a great UFO pits he said oh we have
sightings out there all the time never
reported by inquiry do with a couple of
my Turkish
