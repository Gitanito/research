welcome and good evening good evening
to an extraordinary extraordinary
weekend
with dr steven greer
we&#39;re here at the miracle springs resort
and spa in desert hot springs
and i promise you this weekend
just may
just may change your life
we&#39;re going to be listening to dr greer
talk about advanced intensives on
contact remote viewing
and becoming an ambassador
to the universe
it is with a great deal of honor and joy
that i introduce you
to a dear friend
a brilliant man
and somewhere that may open the gateway
for you let&#39;s give it up for dr steven
greer
you&#39;re beautiful
i love you be careful
all right thank you so much carmel
i&#39;d like to welcome all of you here and
the thousands of people who are watching
online all over the world uh thank you
for your help and support
in making this event possible you guys
like this place have you gotten in the
hot springs for fun huh yeah
wonderful and i&#39;d like to thank all the
volunteers
uh everyone here are doing this as a
volunteer to help make this happen and
they&#39;ve come in from all over
the country actually and so uh let&#39;s
let&#39;s give a big hand a round of
applause for leon
yeah
so
this is uh
going to be around 16 hour intensive
between now and sunday at six o&#39;clock
where i want to take all of you
into a journey
in the understanding of consciousness
interstellar
contact
trans-dimensional physics
and
a glimpse into the future
and my objective is really to do this in
a way
that by the time you leave sunday
if you listen carefully and practice the
protocols that will be shared you&#39;ll be
able to form your own
ambassador to the universe group
wherever you live
and and be a true ambassador in
consciousness to these civilizations
the reason that&#39;s so important is uh
first there&#39;s nobody else doing it
there&#39;s nobody else doing it
the secretary of state isn&#39;t
the u.n secretary general isn&#39;t
who&#39;s doing this
so
the people of earth are doing it and now
we have thousands of teams all over the
world doing
close encounters of the fifth kind
using the understanding of higher states
of consciousness
and the reality that primacy rests with
the mind
with consciousness that everything
emanates from that
field
that is a unlimited field of pure
consciousness
that all of space and time and matter is
actually
the stuff of consciousness phasing and
resonating as that thing
and this has actually been proven
scientifically
some years ago before i started this
organization there was an
physics group that was
doing an experiment with photons
and this was reported in newsweek and
time all the
lame stream media
and
it they reported and it was reproducible
but as they
tracked a photon going down a tube to an
opening
that as they move the aperture or the
opening
the photons would pre-cognitively
change course in anticipation of the
next movement
how is this possible
so
even
the behavior of photons
particles
matter
our bodies
all of it is wired into
this infinite network of pure conscious
intelligence and so it&#39;s no longer
something that&#39;s only the realm of the
mystics
and what have you
it&#39;s also the realm of the most advanced
science going on on the planet today
and has been going on for a long time
what we&#39;re doing is taking that science
of consciousness and the ancient
knowledge of awareness from the ancient
vedic
era
that predates any known human
civilization by the way
and
using the science of consciousness and
the deep meditative state
to go into
non-local
awareness
expanded consciousness
so that we can not only be centered in
that field
a pure consciousness
and act from there
but also it becomes an operating system
the central operating system of the
universe is consciousness
and so as we get to this understanding
we can then
become
ambassadors to these civilizations
because they&#39;re not just using one of
these things
1844 let me give you that date first
telegraph sent
by the way turn off your phones if you
have them on
this is 1844 technology
it&#39;s at the speed of light
it&#39;s electromagnetic fields
and it&#39;s very old
now it&#39;s kind of cool and it&#39;s been
miniaturized from the telegraph and the
early telephones but it&#39;s
old basic science
what we&#39;re going to talk about from now
until sunday night at six o&#39;clock
are the sciences that are actually
already extant
they exist
that have been suppressed and the
knowledge that&#39;s been suppressed
through the high priests of our society
whether they be scientific corporate
governmental religious whatever they are
because they really don&#39;t want people to
know
that every single person is in reality a
portal
into the unbounded
universe
and
there&#39;s a wonderful saying from the
ancient persian tradition
i think is thyself a puny form
when within the the universe is folded
it&#39;s a rhetorical question the entire
universe and multiverse is folded like a
quantum holographic
conscious entity within every single
person every sentient person
and every point in space and time is
accessible instantly
to any other point in space and time by
nature of
consciousness
the mind
now most of the time we keep ourselves
fixated on
ourselves our bodies and our immediate
environment but even when we&#39;re in that
state there&#39;s a deeper aspect of our
consciousness
that knows and is connected
to this larger unbounded reality for
example a few hours before 9 11
the random number generators that were
running
did this massive exponential spike
right before
that happened
because there was a disturbance
precognitively in the force
because we all felt it
one way or another the deeper aspect
this has been proven over and over and
over again in scientific reproducible
experiments
back in the 1990s i had a conversation
with a brilliant man at princeton named
dr bob john
at the princeton engineering anomalies
research lab and
he basically said what we&#39;re doing out
under the stars
is what he&#39;s been able to prove is the
reality in engineering systems with
random number generators which are
basically machines that spit out ones or
zeros
in what would normally be a 50 50
distribution randomly but that when you
put your attention on them you can shift
it to ones or zeros
we&#39;re gonna get more into this and this
has been reproducible
multiple places this is not junk science
at all and it has proved the
non-locality of mind and how thought can
affect
an adamant object a random number
generator
there are literally hundreds of
experiments like that that have been
done over the last few decades and yet
this isn&#39;t what we&#39;re teaching our
children
we&#39;re teaching them that their
or even our phd students
about physics and neurobiology
we&#39;re teaching them an old reductionist
paradigm that actually has expired and
been replaced by this larger
understanding
of reality
of what the true reality is and that is
we live in a conscious aware universe
and as sentient beings
we can become aware
of just a quiet pure state of awareness
and from that quiet centered space
open up intentionally even as an
individual to see remote places remote
times distant planets other galaxies
other civilizations
back in 1991
about a year after i founded the center
for the study of extraterrestrial
intelligence
i wrote a paper
called
the comprehensive assessment of the ufo
extraterrestrial subject
and it&#39;s in the first book that i
published in 1999
uh which some of you have read actually
i found most people don&#39;t read it&#39;s all
it&#39;s all boob tube i mean youtube
but which is great i mean but it is
there&#39;s some value to being able to be
literate and read i do recommend
learning how to read um
you&#39;ll see some running commentary
through my presentation um
but in this i i put this this paper so
it was a white paper position paper
and in it i described something called
consciousness assisted technology
so you have a
a device like this
and instead of having to physically
touch it you think to it
you think to it
and it then can absorb and transmit with
perfect accuracy
to another star system galaxy what have
you in real time
because there&#39;s no
there&#39;s no delay when you&#39;re using the
field of consciousness and thought
what&#39;s the speed of thought it&#39;s
instantaneous what&#39;s this what&#39;s what&#39;s
the field of consciousness it&#39;s
omnipresent and this has been proven in
physics and science therefore
when you&#39;re talking about
extraterrestrial civilizations
you have to forget
what you&#39;ve been taught about
how science works
and how societies operate so you kind of
have to crash the understand you have to
bring it back to zero and rebuild it in
a new paradigm and the new paradigm is
one that is centered in the
understanding of the science of
consciousness thought non-locality
in physics which means that as as eisen
it was funny because einstein discovered
that there could you know had had
something called the spooky effect where
there would be
the observation of a particle in two
places at the same time which is not
supposed to be possible
and he was spooky to him there&#39;s nothing
spooky about it if you understand
non-locality in physics which we&#39;re
going to deal with a great deal this
weekend
and ultimately this gives you an
understanding of why as an ambassador to
these other civilizations
you have to have first mastered a
paradigm and an understanding
ironically of inner space
before you can comprehend outer space
because outer space
is it&#39;s real
and you can go and look at the stars and
at the speed of light it does take two
and a half million years to get a
light to the andromeda galaxy which is
two and a half million light years away
so within that realm of physics all
those laws of physics apply
but there are other
aspects
that are trans-dimensional and conscious
aspects of even the 3d universe which
are now
been which have now been proven
which you have to also understand and
master if you&#39;re going to be an
ambassador to contact these
civilizations or have a scintilla of
understanding
of how they contact you
and how the phenomenon might appear
what if they start suddenly to take
your cell phone
and all of a sudden
an extraterrestrial sphere
metallic sphere appears in the image of
it
this has happened we have a team in new
york and a wonderful woman
and she was
had us had just a regular cell phone she
had read the book hidden truth forbidden
knowledge was sort of my own
autobiography about all this
and the experiences i&#39;ve had and
her phone
suddenly turned on lit up and there was
this extraterrestrial sphere metallic
sphere in it
and she went what is this she took and i
actually contacted the phone company
they had no
explanation then she tried to ignore
that this is impossible this can&#39;t be
then it happened again
and then she was at her dentist&#39;s office
and suddenly
the the sea seti
tones that we project out into space
started
going over the loudspeaker system or the
music system in the dentist&#39;s office
exactly out of the sea seti protocols
and the dentist comes out and says what
is going on it sounds like a spaceship
is landing
it was then that she realized she
probably ought to come to one of these
week-long expeditions and really learn
about what&#39;s going on
and she did and then she sends this form
this huge
group in
new york that is doing this on a monthly
basis
and
the
ways that these civilizations can appear
and manifest
doesn&#39;t have to be a hollywood movie
it usually is not
and so you have to begin to understand
if you&#39;re dealing with civilizations
that are interstellar
their paradigm is also trans-dimensional
and conscious
and by trans-dimensional i mean not just
3-d
but all the dimensions
that exist in the cosmos
up to and including the unbounded field
of cosmic mind the unperturbed still
centered state of cosmic awareness
because that is the central operating
system for not only
understanding how to traverse the cosmos
but also technologically
how to even communicate and travel
across these distances of space
so here&#39;s something that most people
don&#39;t think of
if they are here and it&#39;s not something
made by lockheed martin up here at the
lockheed skunk works in other words it&#39;s
something that&#39;s truly interstellar
it is
also trans-dimensional
it can go from a star system in a galaxy
a million light years away
go through a resonance field shift
frequency
harmonics
the technology is pretty well known now
how this happens
quote unquote dematerialize
and all that means is that it&#39;s just
shifted out of linear 3d and the speed
of the atoms and the electrons and
everything shifts and the angular
momentum and spin changes so it just
disappears it could be hovering in this
room and disappear right in front of
your eyes
which is what we see all the time we go
out in the desert or wherever
and then
up here at another galaxy
not at the speed of light or the speed
of the space shuttle god help us
but
almost
at the speed of thought we&#39;ll get into
why it&#39;s not quite there&#39;s a
coefficiency of drag when there&#39;s still
a connection to the underbelly of linear
space-time in what&#39;s been called the
near astral like your light body
so
these civilizations understand this
and if they&#39;re going to if you&#39;re going
to be
someone
to take the place of
the sociopaths and psychopaths who have
made this subject secret
and tried to weaponize space and
militarize our relationship with these
civilizations
you can&#39;t do it from the
linear paradigm that is a materialist
reductionist paradigm
you at least have to begin to understand
how these civilizations
are operating and how they know reality
and the beautiful thing about it is
read the book of your own soul
read the book of your own self and
you&#39;ll know it&#39;s all folded within you
the entirety of the cosmos and all these
dimensions are folded within
like a quantum hologram that&#39;s conscious
inside every single human being and
every single sentient being i&#39;ll take it
a step further it&#39;s actually folded
within
every point
in space and time
and every
grain of sand
has within it all of these folded in
because it&#39;s in it&#39;s an infinity within
infinity within infinity
does this i hope this isn&#39;t too
confusing or this is like the beginning
just wait till sunday so
i&#39;m trying to give you an idea of of
what the task is for us
to go from what i call
our current understanding of reality in
our civilization&#39;s deliberate
mis-education of us
to an understanding that begins to be
able to approach
what any interstellar civilization has
to have mastered
in order to become interstellar
trans-dimensional and interstellar
because it&#39;s one thing to study this
thing as sort of a
ufologist i don&#39;t know what that is
really um
but if you&#39;re actually going to go
beyond collecting
retrospective case reports of which
there are hundreds of thousands we don&#39;t
need really any more of
them and
do something that is forward-looking
and take the responsibility
to be a human
who&#39;s developing a relationship with
these civilizations
because our governments have failed us
and it&#39;s now our turn our time as the
public to step into this
role you have to understand all of this
so
while a lot of what will be shared this
weekend may seem
pretty advanced it&#39;s really
elementary
it&#39;s it&#39;s really the basis
for being able to to operate
as someone out under the stars with a
team of people
engaging in the close encounters of the
fifth kind
which is when humans initiate or
cooperate with the contact experience
in a program
the close encounters of the fifth kind
program requires us taking
responsibility for ourselves and our
planet and not looking to the next
president of the united states to do
this for us
i&#39;ve lived through mm-hmm
papa bush
we&#39;re doing this actively
papa bush clinton won clinton two
baby bush one baby bush ii
obama won and obama too
and i won&#39;t bore you with the the all
the things that i&#39;ve dealt with from one
administration to the next
what i can tell you is
the likelihood
that
these governmental bodies will do
anything
useful
is
not
very high
unless we
the people lead
and moreover create this
so-called morphogenic field effect that
rupert sheldrake talks about this sort
of effect within
the field of consciousness because when
a certain number of people begin to do
something
it actually causes a shift
in the thinking and awareness and
potentiation
of everyone on the planet
i&#39;ll take it one more step
of everyone in the cosmos
because if we&#39;re truly talking about
non-locality
where every point in space and time is
instantly connected through this
conscious field and other dimensions to
every other point in space and time
then there is no separation in space or
time
and since there&#39;s no separation
whatever we&#39;re doing can actually be
picked up and felt by every planet every
dimension in every galaxy because there
is no linear barrier
now this begins to
really unveil
how profound the understanding of
consciousness is in the work we and the
task we have at hand
because this is the generation living
today on this planet that has to go from
a very primitive and as as mishikaku
says a level zero
civilization that&#39;s destructive
to the planet
still having wars
destroying the biosphere to a level one
two three four civilization on up
in a relatively short amount of time
and in fact
it is
recovering
the lost century because most of this
information i&#39;m sharing was known 100
years ago
even technologically
maybe not down to the granular level of
physics
but certainly in terms of experimental
data going back over a hundred years
and
we don&#39;t have another hundred years
to fritter away with endless war
and a paradigm of energy that destroys
the planet but more importantly a
paradigm of consciousness of separation
we have to get into a consciousness of
interconnectivity
that is both real and manifest but also
understood through the experience of the
deep
aspect of our own conscious mind
you know irwin schrodinger the father of
a particle wave theory it became the
basis for quantum mechanics said and i
believe it was 1908
you can google it look it up early part
of the century the total number of mines
in the universe is one
that is it&#39;s a singularity
now that was a hundred and
10 years ago whatever
and he was a scientist
and not a mystic
and so when you look at this you realize
wow i mean those of us you know
on earth today
have somehow been deceived
not just about the nature of the fact
that there&#39;s intelligent life out there
visiting this planet and the sciences
and technologies that have been studied
in reverse engineer that could get us
off oil gas coal nuclear power
surface roads highways those of you who
drove out of la my condolences
or whatever
but also then this this profound deep
knowledge
of consciousness and the science of the
mind and consciousness
that is the foundation of understanding
not only ourselves but living together
in peace now why do i say that
well
the consciousness of separation allows
for an infinite number of conflicts
us versus them
white versus black
gay versus straight
west versus east
shia versus sunni
hindu versus muslim
on and on and on and on however
the experience and knowledge of this
state of
who and what we really are
which transcends all these fracture
lines
of our culture
that have built up over thousands of
years
is something that then
heals
all those fractures
transcends them and
will allow us to relate to one another
in a way that transcends
separation into this state of
the all and oneness
now this is really important because you
know humans are still on this earth
fighting over every kind of trivialism
capitalism versus this liberalism versus
the you know it&#39;s isms and isms and isms
and isms and this ism and another ism
and it&#39;s not just
economic it&#39;s religious it&#39;s everything
now imagine if we then are tasked
with dealing with in a way that is not
separate and therefore fractured and
prone to conflict
civilizations
that aren&#39;t even homo sapien they&#39;re not
human
what is the point of commonality
this is a profound question
because world peace
is so late 1800s you know i kind of want
to vomit through my eyeballs
i mean that&#39;s that really belonged to
that should have been established
between the late 1800s and early 1900s
we need to be thinking of universal
peace
because we&#39;re being visited they&#39;re
expecting us to join an interplanetary
community
and have been asking us to do so for
quite some time
these extraterrestrial civilizations
and we have dropped the ball one
generation after another for over a
hundred years
and it&#39;s for that reason the earth is
weeping
because it&#39;s not just the problem of the
environment it&#39;s the deep consciousness
level
of what
is the basis of our destruction of the
planet which is rooted in the
consciousness of separation and
destruction
and so if we begin to to contemplate
interfacing with an extraterrestrial
life form or a civilization from another
planet
and we begin to have all the patterned
triggers
of
racism
or inter-species
fear and loathing
that has been built up for thousands of
years and we then project that on the
experience with these civilizations
there&#39;s only one outcome
war conflict
but there&#39;s another way of doing this
and that is understanding that the light
of consciousness radiating from the eye
of that that extraterrestrial life form
and the mind and the sentient and the
light of awareness within ourselves is a
singularity
that&#39;s your point of contact
think about it they&#39;re not going to have
our iq i hope not
they&#39;re not going to have necessarily
all of our
biogenetic legacy although there may be
some that shared
although 98 of ours is identical with
chimpanzees
the other two percent&#39;s an interesting
discussion we may get into that i&#39;m sure
i&#39;ll offend every religious person in
the world
but then
shall i
all right we&#39;ll get there
it&#39;s early yet
but we&#39;re going to have to also consider
the internal universe
our emotional nature
you know there&#39;s a lot of difference
even on earth between someone who grew
up in the culture of japan
and
sicily
would you agree
and there&#39;s a range
of intellectual emotional behavioral
amongst humans and we&#39;re one species
so now extrapolate that amount of
difference
and diversity
into another planetary civilization and
then into thousands of them and then
into millions of them which really do
exist
you&#39;re not going to be able to handle
this overwhelming difference
differentness otherness
unless you&#39;re able to connect on a
deeper and more profound level some
would call it deep evolutionary
spirituality
of deep consciousness
because if you understand and begin to
experience that in the meditative state
in your daily life
then
they&#39;re no longer are they aliens which
is a word i loathe hearing
i like the word e.t better because alien
connotes foreign other
so i just erased the a word if you will
because words are powerful never within
my earshot use the word alien
but
it just means
it conveys in consciousness in the words
and the consciousness behind the word
separation this is why i don&#39;t like the
word
and
we want to be able to then think well
how are we going to relate to these
other civilizations there&#39;s one contact
event we had up here in joshua tree
national park which is right up there
with a uh
et the picture of whom some of you have
seen i&#39;m going to show it this week and
really go drill down deep in what how
that happened and how that experience
happened
and it&#39;s an interstellar
ambassador from the andromeda galaxy
and when we were asking
what is your
i asked you know intelligence and level
and i had
one of these very sensitive magnetic
field meters on
and i i was went through and i was
thinking well you know
genius
on our scale is 160 average is like
you 110.
a standard deviation or so is around 10
points or 15 points
and i got the 200 nothing 300 nothing
400 450.
so this particular
bean and so
cruise around with an iq around 450 and
the equivalence of human
intelligence i iq
which means i&#39;m a
i mean really
um
but
that didn&#39;t that that would that didn&#39;t
intimidate me because i thought well
that&#39;s true and when you look at the
head of this being and also the atacama
humanoid which by the way is et
if you look from the eyes up to the top
of the head
the proportional amount of cranial vault
is around three times hours
and
that&#39;s just the truth
so
we&#39;re having to then think well how are
we going to relate to
a civilization whose occupants have iqs
double
our geniuses or triple our geniuses
and whose sciences and technologies
are all dealing with
thought consciousness switches
guidance systems on the craft are all
connected on that level too by the way
and moreover the spacecraft themselves
are nano bio
machines that have a.i artificial
intelligence to the point of
self-awareness that is a replica
of the consciousness
mind-melded of the occupants
anyone who&#39;s had a very close encounter
with one of these craft will tell you
that they could feel it was
looking at them it was conscious it was
aware of them not just the occupants but
the craft itself was almost a
projection of the consciousness of the
occupants
cool huh
all right it&#39;s not like a 747 floating
across the sky or even one of lockheed
martin&#39;s
or northrop grumman&#39;s anti-gravity
things floating across the desert which
we have seen
so now we&#39;re talking about
how a relatability what is the basis for
a relationship
so all of us are humans and we have
varying degrees of success with
interpersonal relationships
some better than others some are more
functional and some are more
dysfunctional
however we can relate mostly
when we&#39;re talking about civilizations
like this how are we going to relate
well
it&#39;s easy because it&#39;s
the basis of our being is the fact that
we are conscious
and we are sentient and they are
conscious and they are sentient and i
know this sounds terribly
simple
but it&#39;s actually the reality because if
you in connect to that level
it doesn&#39;t matter how much
difference there is if you&#39;re connecting
to the unitive
the unitary state of consciousness which
is why
the experience of this deep quiet state
of consciousness
that&#39;s transcendent that&#39;s within us and
within all things
and that level of connectedness samadhi
isn&#39;t just a pursuit for people who want
to be ascetic sitting in a cave
it&#39;s now
the par the prerequisite
of us becoming
a global and interplanetary civilization
so that&#39;s why this entire area of
consciousness and science is
oh well
it
i didn&#39;t even turn that on how odd
um
well they&#39;re they&#39;re saying yes you&#39;re
right that&#39;s what happens actually we&#39;re
going to get into the
you know what the cia they call this
stuff wsfm
it&#39;s not a radio station it stands
it stands for weird science and freaking
magic it does
and my uncle&#39;s old company uh northrop
grumman they just call it pfm
pure effin magic and i know the
engineers there and um but
it&#39;s not magic
if you understand
this new science
it&#39;s actually completely understandable
