    Most   of us at the very least wonder about our own immortality and many people are   convinced that there is something beyond death, beyond the blackness of the   grave. In Western Judaeo-Christian culture we absorb from an early age the idea   that virtue now has its own reward - later. We are taught that the universe is   essentially moral and that there are absolute human values. But increasingly,   science presents us with a picture of a much more mechanical universe in which   there is no absolute morality and man has no purpose and no personal   responsibility except to his culture and his biology.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

  We no longer live in an age when faith is   sufficient; we demand data, and we are driven by data. And it is data - data   that apparently throws some light on our current concepts of Heaven and Hell -   that the near-death experience seems to offer. The near-death experience (NDE)   is intriguing for two major reasons. First, it is very common and secondly, it   is cross-cultural. The results of one NOP survey in America suggest that over 1   million Americans have 'seen the light'. Any experience that is so common must   have had some influence on the way we think about life and death. Indeed, it   could be the very engine that drives our ideas of an afterlife. Many people   believe that in the NDE we are given glimpses of Heaven (or Hell). But it is   just as reasonable to assume that it is the NDE itself which may have shaped our   very ideas about Heaven and Hell.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

  The experiences described in this book are all   first-hand accounts from people who wrote to me or to David Lorimer, chairman of   the International Association of Near Death Studies (UK), after a television   program, radio broadcast or magazine or newspaper article made them aware of our   interest in near-death experiences. We asked 500 of those who wrote to answer a   detailed questionnaire about their experiences. Our aim was to gather in a   standardized format as much detail as we could about the NDE, the people who   have experienced it and the effect that the experience has had on their lives.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

  It is from this database that   the statistics quoted in this book have been drawn, and the accounts given to me   by these people and by others who have written to me since then form the basis   of the book. But their accounts provided much more than mere statistics. Each   one was special in its own way, and provided a personal testimony which I found   both moving and utterly sincere. It is very seldom that an author can so   truthfully say that without others a book could not have been written - in this   case, without these people there would, indeed, have been no book. I feel   privileged to have been allowed to read their accounts, and I am grateful to   everyone who, by being willing to share their experience with me, has helped in   this search to find the truth in the light.
