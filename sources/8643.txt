    EXPERIENCE DESCRIPTION:
  
         				As a background, I must mention that I have struggled   				for most of my life with Major Depressive Disorder, severe   				anxiety and several other issues.&nbsp; Life has been difficult for   				me in many ways.&nbsp; From the time I was a small girl, however, the   				thought of finding my male counterpart in life brought me great   				joy and hope.&nbsp; I never really doubted it would happen, although   				I didn&#39;t date until I was 17.
  				    				I remember, in third grade, walking down the hall and   				daydreaming about my future partner.&nbsp; I remember thinking, &quot;I   				would like to meet a boy named Tom.&quot; &nbsp;In my mind I could see   				him.&nbsp; He was tall and thin, with brown hair, kind eyes, and   				glasses.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know why his name was Tom, but that&#39;s what I   				remember thinking. (My husband&#39;s name is not Tom, but I will   				call him that for our purposes.)        				When I was older I did finally find a boyfriend.&nbsp; He was   				dark-haired and from a foreign country.&nbsp; We were very much in   				love.&nbsp; After four years of fantastic experiences together, a   				series of events happened that broke us apart, although he did   				ask me to marry him.&nbsp; As difficult as it was, I couldn&#39;t   				accept.&nbsp; I knew he was not the right one for me.        				Shortly before our breakup, I was looking through   				pictures belonging to my best friend.&nbsp; There was a picture of a   				guy I hadn&#39;t met.&nbsp; He had brown hair, glasses, and a very kind   				face.&nbsp; He was very cute, in my opinion, and I commented to my   				friend about it. &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s the guy I want to set you up with if   				you ever break up with your boyfriend!,&quot; she said.        				So after I broke up with the dark-haired guy, a   				different friend said, &quot;I have been waiting for you to break up   				with him!&nbsp; Now I can set you up with Tom!&quot; &nbsp;The other friend was   				there, and she said &quot;I was thinking the same thing!&quot;        				These two friends had known Tom from the dorm, and they   				were able to arrange a party at Tom&#39;s house along with several   				other mutual friends.&nbsp; When Tom opened the door, I felt like he   				had stepped out of my dream.&nbsp; From the navy polo shirt he was   				wearing, to the glasses, I just recognized him as the one I had   				been waiting for.&nbsp; He looked at me as if he had been expecting   				me for years.&nbsp; He put his hand on my knee (which he says now was   				quite out-of-character for him).&nbsp; We were inseparable from that   				moment forward.        				He asked me out on our first date a few days later, on   				the day of the World Trade Center attacks, which I am not sure   				is relevant, but seems odd to me.&nbsp; We were married the next   				year.        				Now, I never considered Tom as my soul mate until   				somewhat recently.&nbsp; I have had many issues throughout our   				marriage.&nbsp; Depression, alcoholism, and much worse.&nbsp; He has stood   				by me through it all.&nbsp; One day, as I was feeling particularly   				insecure, I implored him to tell me one reason why he loved me.&nbsp;   				He said, &quot;I don&#39;t need a reason.&nbsp; I love you because you are   				you.&nbsp; Unconditionally.&quot; &nbsp;He has said we are soul mates.&nbsp; This is   				a strange thing for him to say as he is a very practical and   				scientific person.    				
  				Sometimes I feel that maybe he is some sort of angel, sent to   				help me through life.&nbsp; He has allowed me to grow and lends a   				comforting perspective.&nbsp; He never judges me.&nbsp; But I think I help   				him learn things too.&nbsp; I am sure that I help him practice   				patience.&nbsp; I have given him more than enough reason to leave,   				and many men would have.&nbsp; But still, 15 years later, we continue   				to move forward and our relationship just gets stronger.        				Looking back, the events that caused us to come together   				seem so designed.&nbsp; For about a year before we met, he had   				started going to my college, and I had become unhappy in my   				current relationship.&nbsp; We had both started working out and   				taking care of our appearances, thinking we might meet someone   				special.&nbsp; We coincidentally had the same friends but somehow we   				didn&#39;t meet each other until that party.&nbsp; We both knew, from the   				first moment, that we were meant to be together.        				I may be deluded, but I think I chose a hard challenge   				in this life and God gave me this man to help me through it.&nbsp;   				And somehow I knew he would come, which gave me strength to keep   				going. &nbsp; Now I am working on my true calling, which is helping   				others with mental illness.&nbsp; If it weren&#39;t for him, I would be   				struggling, and possibly unable to complete my life purpose.        				As I was writing this, our wedding song came on the   				playlist unexpectedly.&nbsp; Just another sign!        				Thank you for letting me share.
