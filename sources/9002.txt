  		              		Experience Description   

    I was clinically dead for 65 minutes.  The first responders  did CPR for two hours and had to inflate my collapsed heart with a balloon through my femoral artery. My left lung had also collapsed. They said quote, 'I came in a body bag.' Even once they had me hooked up to machines, my heart was finally beating without CPR. I have burn scars even until today from the shock device. I suspect that I always will have those scars.  It was touch and go until they did a brain scan for activity to see if I was brain dead. I suffered no brain damage. If it  was not for the scars, I would show no sign that I had died. 

  I don't remember taking my own life with a very lethal dosage of drugs for my anxiety. I was on the cold beach that night. Luckily a passerby saw me. A police officer performed CPR for 20 minutes before the ambulance got there. My body had everything shut down except my metabolism, which was the only reason they didn't give up trying to resuscitate me.

There were no faces but they weren't faceless. It's just  a different way of seeing in a different  place. I was on a boat surrounded by turquoise waters. There were tropical islands too.  This scenery is  not something In my life here on earth, that's for sure.
