  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in a  motorcycle accident with my boyfriend. My boyfriend was driving and died on the spot. I rode behind him without a helmet and had a traumatic brain injury. 

 I found myself at the hospital and watched the whole team of doctors and nurses around me. I heard the beep of the devices.  The scene was dramatic as they made every effort to revive me.  Apparently they announced that I was dead.  

  I remember perfectly having seen a tunnel with the bright white light that was far away and at the end.  I remember that I was moving at a high speed. I was light as I flew.  It was a very amazing sensation.  I put my hands under my body and was clinging to something and I stopped suddenly.  

  At this moment I woke up. I was sleeping on a bed near the entrance of a room.  There was a small window and the room was lit with candles hanging on the wall.  I looked around and saw white sheets that covered something.  I knew some time afterwards that they were corpses.  I remembered these moments a few months after going back home. I started to speak to my mother and she immediately said that I was still in the shock from my accident.  Whenever I tried to come back to this topic, I was always stopped from telling my story.  

  Years have passed and I have always been interested in this phenomenon, but without going any further.  Three weeks ago, I watched a TV show. I heard a priest tell the exact same story. I thought I was reliving that moment.  Since it was not very far from my village, I made contact and will meet him soon.  A weight lifted off my shoulders when I knew that there were people like me, people who also went through this experience.
