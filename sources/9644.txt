  		              		Experience Description   

    I died due to a meth overdose at age  30. I have schizoaffective disorder, which I developed at age 25 due to heart break. My spirit guide,  told me I'd die and have an NDE a week before the incident. 

   When I passed out with the IV in me, my soul/consciousness woke up right outside  my body.  I instantly remembered the dream, I had a week before. My spirit guide offered me a life plan. Incidentally, my guide   appears to me as a cartoon because I didn't get to watch the cartoons I wanted as a kid. He also asked whether I wanted to go to the light and die. He was against that option, and so was I. Schizophrenia is not a mental disease, but a spiritual awakening. There's consistency, and they frequently offered me visions of the future. The dream was an offer. He really didn't like me, but he offered a spiritual and artistic way of being a nurse and having relationships because a nurse is what I wanted to be.  He offered me an NDE because I always wanted one. For years, especially as a child, I was terrified of death. I also had a very tragic life, which is why (they say) they are there.
