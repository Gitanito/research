  		Experience Description

  					     Sybille's Book:&nbsp;   &quot;Ohne Müssen und Sollen&quot;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; Click Here  					                                                                                                                					  



  					  I was in surgery. During  anesthesia, I had a near death experience. 

                          Before the effect of anesthesia started to make me unconscious, my last thought was, 'I'm delivering myself to God's arms.' What happened then, I'm going to relay in a logical sequence, one after another; although during the experience it had no sequence in time. Everything was timeless. Everything was hyper-real and more real than my physical existence. Everything I experienced had great truthfulness. 

                          I was in a tremedously vast, light-flooded space. The space was without limits, like space without space. The light was bright, warm, pleasant, and loving. It didn't have any source, but was everywhere. When I arrived, I felt loved and endlessly happy. I knew, here is my real home.

                          I became aware of Beings of light who were standing in a circle. Very distinctly, I heard light streaming through them.  The light went through them as if oscillating and pulsating through their veins. I was standing in the middle of this circle, as if we would be holding  hands. I looked down at myself and noticed that the light was streaming through me the same way it was streaming through the Beings.  There was no difference between us. We have been, still are one big family of light.

                      Soon after I woke up from surgery, a young doctor came to my hospital bed and asked me about my experience. He had been aware that something special had happened.

                          PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SOUL.

                          Excerpt from my book &quot;I belonged to here. Everything was radiating love. It was the most beautiful, wonderful experience, that I experienced until now. Even today I have tears of emotion when I'm talking about.
                          
                          Following this I felt that I was flowing down through various planes. It was similar to being in a very fast elevator crashing. I landed on a level, which was narrow, cold, dark; on the level of the physical body. I knew this is the level on which I will exist further on. This was terrible. It held the whole misery that I know of. The apparent separation from the plane of light was the most painful. As all sentient beings are existing on this level, in this world, and have to suffer under this darkness, tightness and coldness, they deserve compassion.&quot;

    At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain    Surgery-related. While under general anesthesia.      After the surgery, a doctor asked me what had happened. But I have no knowledge about what happened during the operation.    
    
How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant

    How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid    

    Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       My vision was totally unrestrained, clear, free, and like timeless. My everyday vision is more strenuous, more restrained, and more processed.    
    
Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      What I normally can hear happened there telepathically. I didn't hear but knew it immediately.

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         An unusually bright light    

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   The light was bright, warm, pleasant, loving. It had no source but was everywhere. It was alive.    

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I was in a vast, enormous, light-flooded space. The space had no limits. Actually it was a space without space.

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No         

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No       

God, Spiritual and Religion:         

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant   I would call myself 'spiritual'.    

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     To forgive got immensely important. I have established that during every meal we are expressing our gratitude for it (prayer). In general my gratitude became stronger. I'm living very seclusive since.    

What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant   I would call myself 'spiritual'.    

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     Everything I experienced complies in my most profound depth with my beliefs. This is what makes it worth to live, to remind me about letting others taking part in it, so that more love and light are possible on earth, through realization of what we are.    

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I'm living more seclusive. I cherish quietness even more. I know intuitively what's the matter with other people.    

    Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   If you can call it a being? This extremely strong  presence was full of love, light, and warmth. 
    
Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them    

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     The light was bright, warm, pleasant, and loving. It had no source, but was everywhere. I felt at home, having arrived, feeling loved, and endlessly happy. I knew, here is my real home.                          I became aware of beings of light, standing in a circle. Very distinctly, I heard light streaming through them, which went through them as if oscillating and pulsating through veins. I was standing in the middle of this circle, as if we would be holding  hands. I looked down on me and noticed that the light was streaming through myself in the same way. There was no difference between us. We have been, and yes we are one  big family of light.                        
    
    During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     God definitely exists.   I perceived a pure presence, unimaginable love, warmth and a warm light, which was everywhere, flooding, radiating through everything.    
    
Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:         

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   It was the most beautiful, loving thing I experienced so far. And I was a part of it. It was my real home, and earthly life seems more like an field trip of learning in a physical body, which is making it difficult to remember the truth.    

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     On my return, I learned how important it is to have compassion on all sentient beings that exist at this level of boundlessness. It was so dark, cold and tight on this level that it scared me deeply.    

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists          It's a continual life, that can only be perceived fractionally on the physical level.    

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     The spiritual light beings are flooded by this same light, as we are. We all are one family, without distinction.    

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I already said this under Nr. 36. It's so limited here, so far away from the actual life/light, that it's important to develop compassion for all the beings here.    

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     The essential core experience was love, infinite love, which was/is at the same time my home. Everything that exists, is flooded by this. This love is my home. It is at the same time everywhere. It manifests itself in the pulsating, radiating, ever-present light.    

    What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     My fear in my earthly life is diminished. Sometimes, even by remembering this experience in anxiety situations, I can completely quench my anxiety. I have recently been in existential situations, eg. For example, when someone died, I noticed that I had a firm footing, understood immediately what happened to the other person, was completely unperturbed, but compassionate. I could not have been that way before my experience. But this power in me unfolds only over the years. She was not there suddenly. I needed time for that. I first had to regenerate, sort things out, and trust myself.    
    
Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I rather 'see' how deep relationships are. I'm practicing forgiveness and am trying to encourage other people to find sense in this practice. I became softer, more tolerant, if somebody is doing a mistake and is hurting me. I can't stand anymore the presence of many people, of crowds. Noisy people are painful for me.    

After the NDE:         

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   For one I have to tell things, that all happened at the same time, in sequence, one thing after the other. Being put into words, it rather seems like an approximation to the experience.    

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.e experience  It's like burnt inside me, so much more real than everything else. It's like an essence upon all my questions.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     My gifts of knowing what's the matter with other people, that I already had before, and my perception of light beings in the spiritual world has become clearer.    

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The certainty and clearness in which the light and love were omnipresent.    

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I was questioned by a doctor after the surgery. I told my husband when still in my hospital bed. In my book I described this experience. 'Ohne Müssen und Sollen&quot; 
    
Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   As a first book I read Mrs. Kübler-Ross, later on also other books. This matter always interested me. So you can say that I was well prepared. And yet, the immediate experience was different, as conceivable.    

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     This experience was stronger than the experience of pain following the operation, even though they have been horrible. Somehow it was absorbing me. It resonated.    

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     The clarity, immediacy, the completely undisturbed of what I experienced. were hyperreal, actually more real than this writing here.    

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   When I recently accompanied a dying person, I was, I believe, so firm and secure in everything through this NDE.    

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         During the long six months after the experience, when I was badly off, it needed time until I had integrated this experience. Even today I have tears of emotion, when I'm talking of the light.    

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I can not think of anything.                          I thank you.
