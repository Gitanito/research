    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Croire.
 Revue Critique, Documentaire et de Vulgarisation des Croyances.  Superstitions, Occultisme, Religions Comparees.
 1931--1932?  Monthly
 Paris, France.  Language:  French.  Editor: Mme and M. Werbrouck; G. Le Rouge; literary editor, Victor Vie-Parodi.
  1/1, December 1931-1932(?)  7 francs 50 a year.

 Noted in Astrosophie, 1932.   The purpose of the journal, as outlined in the first issue, was to bring rationality and a critical spirit to occultism and superstition and to do so in form accessible to the public.  The journal proclaimed that it would present the constituent parts of the occult (astrology, phrenology, chiromancy, cartomancy, and the like) in the same critical spirit that James George Frazer brought to mythology in his Golden Bough, but the introductory issue consisted only of disjointed pieces: "The Cult of Nature" by Victor Vie-Parodi, G. Le Rouge's "Telepathic and Divinatory Plants" (peyote, datura, "ayahuasea," yaje), "Abdallah's" "Astrology," Mme Werbrouck's "The Language of Flowers," and the beginning of a long orientalizing "Novel of Prehistoric Reconstitution" by Vie-Parodi.  The intellectual pretensions of the journal are somewhat debased by the advertisements, which feature Abdallah's offer of a free horoscope, Aliveda's free graphological analysis, and Madame Paule's invitation to a card reading (10 francs).
