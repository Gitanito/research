I realize that a car came in my direction and it seemed that it would pass over me.  In that moment I felt that I left the body and was moving through the road, not walking, just sliding through the road as if I floated. As I knew about the existence of other ‘dimension’, I knew that I should look for the ‘light’.  I slid many meters (about 500 meters) when, suddenly, I felt a strong light behind me. When I looked, I saw it was a lamppost at the entry of a new traffic route.  I then realized that it wasn’t the light I was looking for.  After a few seconds, I slid back through the road again.  Then there were many people on the sides of the road and I was searching among them for a familiar face.  I heard what they were saying and saw the parked cars.  Suddenly, I stopped moving, looked at the floor, and saw my body.  I thought ‘I still have to go back to that so damaged body’.  After a few seconds, I felt pulled to my body.  When I opened my eyes and moved my fingers, they saw that I was alive and called the paramedics.
