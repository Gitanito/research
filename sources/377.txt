 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  The Occult Review (Boston)</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Occult Review.
 A [Quarterly / Bimonthly] Journal Devoted to Theosophy, Psychology,  Astrology, Palmistry, Occultism, and Literature of the Occult  Associations.
 1888-1900?  Quarterly, then bimonthly from 1895 Boston, MA.  Publisher: Occult Publishing Co. 
Ten-50 cents a year.  8 pp.

 Noted in The Theosophist, 1890, in a  discussion of the Occult Publishing Company of Boston, and in  "Astrological Serial Publications in the United States" in S.C.  Gould's Notes and Queries and Historic Magazine 18, no. 2 (February  1900): 58-59.  Strongly Theosophical in its approach.

 The Boston-based Occult Publishing Company produced a dozen or two Theosophical and occult works, including several by Franz Hartmann, and appears to have been an imprint of the American Theosophist and Bahaist, W. W. Harmon.

The business apparently passed to Walrond's Occult Publishing company, in Denver Colorado, "on the manager's death in December 1903" -- that manager not being W. W. Harmon.     Issues:The Occult Review V1 N2 Apr 1888 The Occult Review V5 N3 July 1892      </p>
