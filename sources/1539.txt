 This was the organ of the Colorado College of Divine Science and the First Divine Science Church of Denver founded by Nona Lovell Brooks and her sisters (Alethea Brooks Small, 1848-1906, and Fannie Brooks James, 1854-1914) in 1898-1889.  Nona Brooks (1861-1945) had been introduced to New Thought when she was cured of a throat ailment in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1887, probably through the work of Kate (Mrs. Frank) Bingham, an independent Christian Science practitioner who had been a student of Emma Curtis Hopkins.  In 1892 Brooks and Malinda E. Cramer of San Francisco (on whom see the notes under Harmony and the Gnostic) were founders of the International Divine Science Federation, and in 1898 she was ordained a minister in Cramer's Church of Divine Science.  For almost 30 years thereafter she proceeded, in Denver and then Chicago and again in Denver, to teach diving healing and to preach on God as the infinite, omnipresent pure Spirit who manifests himself in Creation, as Love, Truth, Substance, Mind, etc., and yet transcends the universe.  Evil and sickness were false beliefs "in a presence and a power other than God. . . .  So long as a man believes in a lie,  he is subject to it in his experience.  As soon as he sees clearly, he sees no evil."  "In the light of God's Presence the darkness disappears."  Unlike some other current varieties of New Thought, Divine Science, although it gave some place to success and money ("I am a financial success," I am the possessor of all money," etc.) was primarily directed toward the consolation and inner harmony and health that flowed from realization of God's omnipresence in the world.  The primary object of Brooks' Colorado College of Divine Science was to train teachers of this revelation by establishing an institute "for the purpose of instruction in the law and order of Divine Healing as declared by Jesus Christ, and for the promotion of the religious, educational and ethical principles which are known as Divine Science, and to grant and confer degrees, diplomas and ministerial certificates to graduates."  Primary training cost $15.00, Bible lessons, $25.00, with separate charges for admission to normal and graduate classes.  The journal presented contributions by various teachers (almost all women, especially in its early days) at the college, like Ada B. Fay, Daisy Mary Davis Baum (Mrs. C.L. Baum), Ruth Elderkin, Agnes M. Lawson, Fannie Brooks James, et al., and gave responses to letters and testimonials from readers and students, Daily Studies in Divine Science, and Sunday School Lessons, together with lists of accredited Divine Science teachers and churches.  The journal occasionally carried articles on topics near and dear to reformers, like "The League of Nations," even though not related to New Thought.  Noted in William C. Hartmann's Who's Who in Occult, Psychic and Spiritual Realms (1925).   Denver Public Library; LOC.
