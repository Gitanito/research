From   		studying &quot;The Holographic Universe&quot; by Michael Talbot where he talks   		about Dr. David Bohm's holographic universe theory; &nbsp;and by&nbsp;reading   		numerous Near Death Experiences I've figured out why we are here, and   		the answer is quite simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the pieces of the puzzle sort of   		just&nbsp;&quot;popped&quot; into my head one afternoon as&nbsp;I was walking from   		the&nbsp;kitchen into the living room.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;almost a mystical experience.&nbsp;   		&nbsp;We are here for three simple reasons.&nbsp;   		  	  		&nbsp;  	  		#1.&nbsp; To become separate unique individuals.&nbsp;   	  		#2.&nbsp; To experience time and space. - Because according to Einstein   		and a whole lot of other quantum physicists time and space aren't real.&nbsp;  		  	  		#3.&nbsp; To gather memories of what it feels like to have a physical   		body, which we do by forming memory engrams which we will use after we   		die to re-create a physical body using the quantum physics principle of   		&quot;thoughts being things&quot; or &quot;consciousness creating reality&quot; like in Dr.   		Fred Alan Wolf's book &quot;The Spiritual Universe.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   	  		&nbsp;  	  		We become unique separate individuals by&nbsp;experiencing separation   		(like death, divorce, or by time and space - like when&nbsp;a loved one moves   		far away), and by experiencing duality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Race, religions, our weight,   		height, color, culture, socio-economic status, personality, emotions,   		etc. all exist for the sole purpose of teaching us what it means to be   		&quot;separate&quot; because on the other side the feeling of oneness and   		connectedness are overwhelming due to it's holographic nature .&nbsp; Even   		crooked teeth, the bumps on our noses, shapes of our faces, etc., all   		teach us what it feels like to be a unique individual.&nbsp; That's why we   		have to live a life in a physical body, so we'll know what it feels like   		to be an individual.&nbsp; The feelings of oneness and connectedness are so   		overwhelming on the other side that &quot;individuality&quot; may be the only   		thing that can't be learned while existing in Heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything in   		the physical universe exists in a &quot;dual&quot; state so that we can identify   		with it, and thus imprint on our consciousness what it means to be   		&quot;separate.&quot;&nbsp;   	  		&nbsp;  	  		The other side is&nbsp;the world of the quantum, where thoughts are   		things, and where consciousness creates reality.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also totally   		holographic in nature.&nbsp; &nbsp; That's why many NDEs say that they went   		into&nbsp;&nbsp;a &quot;hall of learning&quot; or &quot;place&nbsp; of knowledge&quot; and it seemed like   		to them the building was &quot;made of knowledge.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently&nbsp;read a NDE   		where the boy said he thought of a mountain and one instantly   		appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains&nbsp;negative NDEs.&nbsp;&nbsp; People that have a lot of   		negative baggage personify their negative thoughts into demons so they   		can do battle with them, and overcome them.&nbsp; Hate, anger,   		fear,&nbsp;jealousy, etc., all become demons, but at the point when they call   		out&nbsp;to the light, the light appears and so do their demons.&nbsp;&nbsp;   	  		&nbsp;  	  		The feelings of &quot;all knowledge&quot; and pre-birth feelings during NDEs   		are because of the holographic nature of the experience.&nbsp; In a hologram,   		where everything is connected to everything else, where everything is   		cross correlated, and where nothing is&nbsp;separated, all one has to do is   		think of a thing, and it appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;   	  		&nbsp;  	  		The evidence we have&nbsp;for reincarnation can be&nbsp;explained by children,   		who haven't developed a strong sense of &quot;self&quot; having their minds act   		like receivers, picking up information from other folks lives and then   		they manifest the physical signs of those lives through the quantum   		principle of thoughts being things or consciousness creating reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   		When adults are hypnotized their natural filter is turned off, and they   		pick up information from other people that have lived long ago.&nbsp;   	  	  		&nbsp;  	  		We don't live for just ourselves, but for all the consciousness in   		the entire universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The knowledge and memories and feelings that we   		are learning and storing&nbsp;do not belong to&nbsp;us alone, but will be   		available&nbsp;for everyone to use after they cross over&nbsp;so they can create a   		reality on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is shared on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;   		It's a place where there is no separation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lots of links to   		support what&nbsp;I'm saying but&nbsp;I'm tired of typing.&nbsp;&nbsp;   	  		&nbsp;  	  		I know I'm right, but I'm just not a good enough&nbsp;writer to put it all   		in a book..&nbsp;&nbsp;By putting the holographic universe and NDEs together it   		all makes perfect sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are here to learn what it means to be   		separate unique individuals, learn how time and space feel, and what it   		feels like to have a physical body.&nbsp; After all, one can't read a book   		about how&nbsp;riding a bike or making love, and really understand and know   		how it feels to do either.&nbsp; It's only by the&nbsp;doing of a thing that one   		really comes to know how it feels.&nbsp;&nbsp;   	  		&nbsp;  	  	  		Excerpt from Mark H's NDE: &quot;Suddenly I   		thought of a mountain, I had seen as a child.&nbsp; When I looked up from the   		road there it was; The Mountain!&nbsp; Not just the mountain!&nbsp; But the most   		breathtaking mountain I had ever seen!&nbsp; Details the likes of which no   		one could imagine.&nbsp; Colors shades of color, shadows for which there are   		no words in the human language to describe it.&quot;&nbsp;  	  		&nbsp;  	

</font></font>  		  		Excerpt from   		Randy Gehlings' NDE: &quot;That was really cool! I kind of felt as though my   		body exploded - in a nice way - and became a million different atoms -   		and each single atom could think its own thoughts and have its own   		feelings. All at once I seemed to feel like I was a boy, a girl, a dog,   		a cat, a fish. Then I felt like I was an old man, an old woman - and   		then a little tiny baby.&quot;  		  		  		  		  		  		http://www.near-death.com/experiences/animals04.html  		

  		Excerpt from   		Mark Horton's NDE: &quot;This was very pleasant and comforting and went on   		for microseconds or billions of years, I have no idea since time just   		wasn't an operative construct and had no meaning or relevance to   		existence. I literally had the feeling that I was everywhere in the   		universe simultaneously.&quot;  		  		  		http://www.mindspring.com/~scottr/nde/markh.html&nbsp;</p>

Excerpt from &quot;The Holographic Universe&quot; by   		Michael Talbot:

  		&quot;In a   		holographic universe, even time and space could no longer be viewed as   		fundamentals. Because concepts such as location break down in a universe   		in which nothing is truly separate from anything else, time and   		three-dimensional space, like the images of the fish on the TV monitors,   		would also have to be viewed as projections of this deeper order. At its   		deeper level reality is a sort of superhologram in which the past,   		present, and future all exist simultaneously.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://earthportals.com/hologram.html</p>  		

  		  		Excerpt from   		Daisy Dryden's DBV: &quot;Two days before she left us, the Sunday School   		Superintendent came to see her. She talked very freely about going, and   		sent a message by him to the Sunday School. When he was about to leave,   		he said, &quot;Well, Daisy, you will soon be over the 'dark river.` After he   		had gone, she asked her father what he meant by the &quot;dark river.&quot; He   		tried to explain it, but she said, &quot;It is all a mistake; there is no   		river; there is no curtain; there is not even a line that separates this   		life from the other life.&quot; And she stretched out her little hands from   		the bed, and with a gesture said, &quot;It is here and it is there; I know it   		is so, for I can see you all, and I see them there at the same time.&quot;&nbsp;  		  		  		http://www.survivalafterdeath.org/books/barrett/dbv/chapter3.htm</p>  		

  		I don't believe   		we are here to &quot;become one with God&quot; or &quot;learn how to love&quot; or any of   		that stuff.&nbsp; Einstein called the Universe a &quot;persistent illusion&quot; and I   		have a sneaking suspicion he was correct.&nbsp; This isn't the main show,   		it's an illusion we have to endure to learn a few simple lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;-   		Art Riechert&nbsp;ariechert@aol.com</p>  		

Excerpt from Michelle M&quot;s NDE:&nbsp; &quot;I understood   		that it really didn't matter what happened in the life experience, I   		knew/understood that it was intense, brief, but when we were in it, it   		seemed like forever. I understood that whatever happened in life, I was   		really ok, and so were the others here.&nbsp; I remember understanding the   		others here.. as if the others here were a part of me too.&nbsp; As if all of   		it was just a vast expression of me.&nbsp; But it wasn't just me, it was ..   		gosh this is so hard to explain.. it was as if we were all the same.&nbsp; As   		if consciousness were like a huge being.&nbsp; The easiest way to explain it   		would be like all things are all different parts of the same body.. so   		to speak.&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;  		  		  		      </div>  </font></font></font></font></font>
