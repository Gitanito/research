we
have many people in our Network who
worked in unacknowledged special access
projects now this is very different from
a special Access Project or special
access Personnel was reported in the
media about Hillary Clinton having
access to sap well of course every I
mean many people do a special Access
Project is simply a compartmentalized
project within the intelligence system
and you know there are only three levels
of of
classification confidential secret and
top secret it&#39;s the
compartment that you&#39;re in that is key
now Edward Snowden he disclosed
something called prism among other
things prism was a special Access
Project but it was acknowledged the
president knew about it the Congress
knew about it the key members of the
intelligence committees
we&#39;re talking about unacknowledged
special access projects that are funded
to the tune of 100 to20 billion a year
that are illegal because they will not
tell anyone that is not in that
compartment what they&#39;re doing and I
have a number of people who worked in
these projects and for example One navy
gentleman was in one project that was
between two and3 billion doll one
unacknowledged special Access Project
compartment these projects are exactly
the Fulfillment of what Eisenhower
warned us about when he said Beware of
the military-industrial complex and so
it&#39;s for this reason that I want people
to understand that what we&#39;re exposing
are not all secrets within the US
government or all secrets within the
British government we&#39;re only exposing
and this is going to be the greatest
expose in history on this projects that
are unacknowledged and are being run
illegally I want to make this
distinction very clearly so that people
do not get confused there&#39;s a lot of
confusion on this in the
public and we stay on very safe ground
when we are exposing projects that are
being run illegally because let&#39;s face
it if the president of the United
States or the CIA director or these
senior fellows at the Pentagon generals
and Admirals I&#39;ve met with and Ministry
of Defense head in United Kingdom are
being denied access and lied to about
projects going on under their own
command but that are unacknowledged
special access projects that is by
definition unconstitutional illegal it
violates all oversight requirements of
the Constitution and of the National
Security Act so we want to be really
clear that that is those are the
projects that we are going to bring
forward and let people know about and
the reason these projects have such
extreme secrecy around them is because
the implications are so
vast when I started this project
Starlight initiative which uh I was
helping um Lawrence Rockefeller and he
he and I were in the early days in 1993
and for collaborating on this
he I was at his Ranch out in the Tetons
um and the the JY Ranch which had been
the Rockefeller Ranch out there and he
he took me out one night onto the deck
and he said you know Dr Greer the
implications of this disclosure are so
vast and so profound that no aspect of
life on Earth will be
unaffected and I turned to Mr
Rockefeller and I said yes sir that&#39;s
why they&#39;re unacknowledged that&#39;s why
they&#39;re so secret that is precisely the
problem If This Were A trivial issue it
would have leaked out in the in the New
York Times decades ago it&#39;s because the
implications are so profound but these
implications and the
secrecy has become a threat to all life
on
Earth the first head of the CIA who
after he
retired at ad Rosco hener said in a
letter that I
have that the secrecy around UFOs is a
threat to the National Security the UFOs
are not a threat he did not say that the
secrecy is a threat and so it&#39;s not only
a threat to the National Security of the
United States and other countries it is
now that was in
1961 it is now 50 some years later has
become an existential threat to all life
on Earth because we are now destroying
the biosphere and also creating a
geopolitical time bomb where there&#39;s so
much poverty and disparity of income
that it can go in Only One Direction and
that is violent Global Revolution unless
we fix it and so that&#39;s why this issue
is so important it is not a trivial
issue
