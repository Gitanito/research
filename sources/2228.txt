PREFACE.
"
To the law md the testimony," is our motto.
"If they speak not sccording to these, it is because
there is no light in them." The following little msnusl
is a. collection of the Scriptures on several important
points, with but very few explanatory notes or re-
marks. The chief object has been, in getting up this
little work, to let the Scriptures speak for themselves,
and thus put into the hands of Adventists, and indeed
into the hands of all who are in search of Bible truth,
on the subjects of which it treats, acollection of Scrip-
ture references, designed to aid them in the pursuit of
knowledge.
'
Certainly, the Bible is s luminary,
"
unto which ws
do well to take heed, as unto a. light that shinoth in a
dark place, until the Day dawn, and the Du'-Srn
arise in our hearts." May H: who is the light ofthe
world, direct all our researches, and lead us so fully
into the Truth, that we may be perfectly prepared for
His Kingdom and Coming, is our humble prayer.

CHAPTER l.
TBI' l»0l»D JIPUS CHRIST WILL COME T0 THIS EARTH
A SECOND TIKE.
Acts i. 9-ll. "
And when he had spoken these
thin , while they beheld, he was taken up; and s
clougsreceived him out of their sight. And while they
looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went u ,
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel);
which also said, Ye men
of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus which is taken
up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner
as e have seen him go into heaven."
t éeb. ix.f28. "
And to them that look for him shall
he a. pear the second time without sin unto salvation."
Joi: xix. 25-27. "
For I know that my Redeemer
liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon
the earth; and though after my skin worms destro
this body, yet in m flesh shalll see God; whoml
shall see for myself?and mine eyes shall behold, and
not another ; though my reins beconsumed within me."
-For proof that this will be at the resunection, see
Psalmsxvii. 15. "
As for me, I shall behold thy face
in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake
with thy likeness."
Isa. xxiv. 23. "
Then the moon shall be confounded,
and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall
reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his
ancients gloriously."
xxvi. 21. "
For behold, the Lord cometh out of his
place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their
4
.niquityz the earth also shall disclose her blood, and
shall no more cover her slain."
llx. 20. "
And the Redeemer shall come to Zion,
and unto
gem
that turn from transgression in Jacob,
saith the rd."
lxvi. 15. "
For behold, the Lord will come with iiro,
and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his
an er with fury, and his rebuke with flames of tire."
an. vii. 13, 14. "I saw in the night _visions and
behold, one like the Son of man, came with the clouds
of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
brou ht him near before him. And there was given
him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peo-
ple, nations, and languages, should serve him ; his do-
minion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pus
lwayédepd
his kingdom that which shall not be de-
l!»1'0 .
'
Ilan. xxiv. 30. "
And then shsll appear the sign of
the Sou of msn in heaven; and then shall the tribes
ofthe earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man
coming in the clouds of
heaven with power and great
glo .
'
lzrk xiii. 34. "For the Son of msn is es s man
taking a far joumey, who left his house, and gave au-
thority to his servants and to
every
man his work; and
commanded the porter to watch!
Luke xvi. 26, 27. "
And as it was in the days of
Noe, soshall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were
given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into
the ark, and the Hood came and destroyed them all."
Iohnxiv. 1-3. "
Let not your heart be troubled ;
believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's
muse are
many mansions: if it were not so, I would
havarwu you. I go to prepare a place for yon. And
if I go and prepare s place for you, I will come again
and receive you unto myself ; that where I am, there
ye may be also."
1 Cor. xv. 22, 23. "

For this
they willingly are ignorant of, that by the
word of Go the heavens were of old, and the earth

Matt. iii. 9. "
And think not.to ny within your-
selves we have Abraham tn our &ther ; for I say unto
16
gnu,
that God is able of these stones to raise up chil-
ren nnto Abraham."
John viii. 39-44. "
They answered and said unto
him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them,
il' ye were Abrsham's children
rye
would do the works
of Abraham.... Ye are o
your father the devil,
and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was s
murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth : because there is no truth in him. Vhen he
speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a
liar and the father of it."
`
Rev. ii. 9. "I know thy works, and tribulation,
and poverty, (but thou art rich,) and I know the blas-
Ehemy
of them which say

ut are of the
synagogue

iii. 9. "
Beho d, will make them of the syn ogue
of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are notfgut do
lie; behold,I will make them to come and worship
before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee."
Isa. lxv. 11-15.1
"
But ye are they that forsake
the Lord, and forget my holy mountain, that pre are a
table for that troop, and that furnish the drink-ogering
unto that number. Therefore will I number you tothe
sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter,-
because when I called, ye did not answer; when I
spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes,
and did choose that wherein
ldelighted
not. Therefore
thus saith the Lord God, Behol , my servants shall
eat, bntye shall he hungry : behold, my servants shall
drink, but ye shall be thirsty ; behold,
mly
servants shall
rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; beho d, my servants
shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow
of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. And
ye shall
leav%your
name for a curse unto my chosen:
for the Lord od_shall slay thee, and call his servants
by another name."
Could the title ofthe carnal Jews to the land of prom-
ise, be denied in stronger language! _
'Asus xiii. 45, 46. "But when the Jews saw the
nfnltitullel, they were filled
'
with envy, and spake
ll
against those things which were spoken by Paul, con-
tradicting and blaspheming. Then Paul and Bamabas
waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word
of God should have been spoken to you; but seeing
ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy qf
everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles."
Rom. ix. 25-28, 31, 32. "
As he saith also in Osee,
I will call them my people, which are not my people :
and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall
come to pass, that in the place where it was said, unto
them, Ye are not my people ; there shall they be
called, the children of the living God. Esaias also
crieth concerning Israel, though the number of the
children of Israel, be asthe sand ofthe sea, a remnant
shall be saved ; for he will finish the work, and cut it
short in righteousness, because a short work will the
Lord make' upon the earth .... But Israel, which
followed after the law of righteousness, hath not
attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? (or
why?) Because they sought it not by faith, but as it
were by the works ofthe law. For they stumbled at
that stumbling stone."
`Isa. vi. 9-Il. "
And he said, go and tell this
people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see
ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this
people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their
eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with
their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert
and be- healed. Then aid I, Lord, how long! And
he. answered, Until the cities be wasted Without inhab-
itautjand the houses without man, and the land be
utterly desolate." _
, Deut. xxviii. 61, 63. "
Also every sickness, and
every
'plague

law, t em will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be

And I will establish my covenant
between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their
generations, for an
everlasting covenant; to be a
God
unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give
unto thee and to thy seed alter thee, the land wherein
thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an ev#
erlastin¥ possession;
and I,will be their God." p
The ol owing passages show that the promise was
not of literal Canaan. p

Acts vii. 4, 5. "Then came he out ofthe land of
they Chaldeaus, and dwelt in Charran, and from thence,
when his father was dead, he removed him into this
land wherein ye now dwell. And he gave him none
inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on;
yet he promised that he would give it to him for a
pos-
session, and to his seed after him, when as yet he ad
no child."
Heb. xi. 8--ll. "
By faith Abraham, when he was
called to go out into a place which he should after
receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went, not
knowin whither he went. By faith he sojourned in
the lang of promise as in a
stranie country, dwelling
in tabemacles with Isaac and .Taco ,
the heirs with him
of the same promise. For he looked for acity whicli
léaétg 'i`ouudations, whose builder and whose maker is
'
13-16. "These all died in faith, not having re#
eeived the promises, but having seen them afar oft§ and
were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and con~
fessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth. For they that say such things declare plainly
that they seek a country. And truly if they had been
mindful of that country from whence they came out,
they might have had opportunity to have retumed. But
now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly ;
wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God:
for he hath prepared for them a city."

having provided some better
thin?
for us, that they
without us should not be made per ect."
Original promises to Isaac and Jacob.
Gen. xxvi. 3, 4.
"
Sojourn in this land, and I will
be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee and thy
seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform
the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father. And
I will make thy seed to multi ly as the stars of heaven,
and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in
thy seed shall all the nations of the earth he blessed."
Gen. xxviii. 13, 14. "
And behold the Lord stood
above it and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy
father, and the God of Isaac ; the land whereon thou
liest, to thee will give it, and to thy seed. And th
seed shall be as the dust. of the earth ;. and thou shag
spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the
north, and to the south; and in thee and in thy seed
shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
Now, who are THE stan?
Gal. 7--9. "
Know ye, therefore, that they
which are of faith, the same are the children of Abra-
ham. And the scripture, foreseeing that God would
justify the heathen through faith, preached before the
gosgel
unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations
e lessed. So then they which are of faith are
blessed with faithful Abraham."
16-19, 26-29. "
Now to Abraham and to his
seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to
seeds, as of many, but. as of one, And to thy seed,
which is Christ. And this I say, that the covenant
which was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law,
which was fourhundred and thirty years after, cannot
disannul, that it should make the promise of none
effect. For if _the inheritance be of the law, it is no
more of promise. Wherefore, then, serveth the law!
-It was added because of transgressions, till the seed
should come to whom the promise was made; and it
was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. . .

For ye' are all the children of God by faith in Christ
Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into
Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor
Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither
male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye _Abraham's seed,
and heirs according to the promise." _
The above texts show to whom the promises belong.
The following allegory presents the subject in a clear
li ht.
gGal. iv. 21-26, 28, 30, 31. "
Tell me, ye that de-
sire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For
it is written, Abraham had two sons, the one by'a bond
woman, the other by a free woman. But he who was
ofthe bond woman was born after the flesh; but he of
the free woman was by promise. Which things are an
allegor ; for these are the two covenants: the one
from Nilmunt Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which
is Agar. For this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and
answereth to Jerusalem, which now is, and is in bon-
dage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above,
is free, and is the mother of us all .... Now we,_
brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. . .
Nevertheless, what saith the scripture! Cast out the
bond woman and her son; for the son of the bond
woman shall not be heir with the son of thefree wo-
man. So' then brethren, we are not children of the
bond woman, but of the free."

The following extract from DR. GlLI»?S Body qf
Divinity, shows that that very learned and godly man
applied the Scriptures concerning the two
resurrections
as we now do.,
'
"The distribution of the persons to be raised, are
of two sorts, the just and the unjust; that the just, or
righteous ones, will be raised from the dead, there can
be no doubt; since thetresurrection of the saints is
called the resurrection q/f the just from them, Luke
xiv. 14, it being peculiar to them; and the _first resur-
rection, Rev. xx. 6, because they will rise first; and
the better resurrection, Heh, xi. 35, being better than
that of the wicked, and of which only some are counted
worthy, Luke xx. 35, ,and is what the apostle Paul
desired to attain unto, Phil. ll, called

2 Peter i. 19--21. "
We have also s more sure word
of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed,
as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the
day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts;
knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is
of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came
not in old time by the will of man; but
holé
men of
God spake as they were moved by the Holy host."
Isa. lxvi. 2. "
But to this man will I look, even to
him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth
at my word."

Points of Difference between Adventists
and their Opponents.
1. We hold that
thevprophetic days of Daniel and
John are years ; as did esley, Scott, Clark, Fletcher,
the learned Joseph Mede, Faber, Prideaux, Dr. Hales,
Bishop Newton, and Sir Isaac Nevton, with all the
standard Protestant commentators. Our opponents
claim that they are simply days, or
half-days !
2. We claim that the prophecies of Daniel and John
are historical prophecies, extending to the end of time,
as all Christians have held, according to the undoubted
testimony of historians, till our day. And if the end
is not
brought to view by these prophecies, they are
to us inexplicable.
3. We claim that the ninth of Daniel is an
aplpendix
to the eighth, and that the seventy weeks and t e 2300
gays
or years commence together. Our opponents
en this.
li. Hales renders Dan. ix. 27, thus :
"
But one week
shall establish a [new] covenant with many ; and half
of the week shall abrogate the [daily] sacrifice and
oblation. And upon the pinnacle [or battlement of
the temple shall stand] the abomination of desolation,
even until the consummation [of the 2300 days.] But
then the decreed [desolation] shall be poured [in turn]
upon the desolator."
He then adds,
"
This chronological
prophecy (which
I have attempted to render more close y and intel-
Jigibly, supplying the ellipsis
necessary
to complete
the sense of the original,) was evident y designed to
explain the foregoing vision, especially in its chrono-
w -r,
logical pert ofthe 2300 days; st the end ol' which the
predicted desolstion of the Jews should eesse, and
their sanctu be cleansed."
'
If the "
§¥CEEDING GREAT HORN" of Dan.
viii. is ROME, as all standard Protestant commentators
admit, it follows that the 2300 days must be years.
And ss the 2300 days extend to the cleansing of the
ssnetuuy, and the sanctuary in to be desolsted to the
end of the world; if they begin with the seventy
weeks, it follows that we have approached the very
consummation, and may look daily for the coming of
the Son of God.
A
4. We believe that the longer prophetic period!
mark the limits of probation; and that when they
expire, the Lord himself will descend from heaven
with a shout, raise all the righteous dead in incorrup-
tion and glory, change all the righteous living from
mortality to immortality, restore the v/hole earth to its
Eden state, and set up God's everlasting kingdom.
Then the kingdom and the dominion, end the great-
ness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shsll be
given to the people of the saints of the Moet High,
whose kingdom is an
everlasting kingdom, and sl!
dominions shall serve and obey him. Our opponents
locate their abode above the whole heaven.
