Somehow, I hit my head and was knocked out. The next thing I remember was seeing a bunch of people gathered around something. I was above and able to see the backs of their heads, wondering what was going on. I remember asking what was happening and then seeing my body lying on the ground. The next thing I know I was going toward a bright light. Once there I saw a short woman, but she did not look human, rather she looked both bright and transparent at the same time. I knew her; she was my grandmom who passed away when I was an infant. She did not tell me, I just knew. She was with another person, I knew it was my brother who passed away before I was born (I did not know I had a brother that died at the time). 

My grandmom was telling me to go back, but I felt so good there that I wanted to stay. It was so peaceful. She then started to say, 'Jack. Jack she will not go'. Then my father came out to see me and he held me. It was so right, like I was home. (My father had died when I was 6) He said I could not stay; I had to go back because it was not my time. I needed to go back. I didn't want to go, but the next thing I knew I was in my mother's living room and she was talking to me but I could not understand her. I could not hear her. Then my mother was asking me if I was ok and to answer her. I told her I saw Daddy, and she told me never to say that again, so I didn't.
