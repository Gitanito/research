  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I have asthma and as the result of applying an anti-inflammation cream to reduce pain in my neck I had a severe asthma attack that resulted in respiratory failure. I was unconscious. During the minutes before my loss of consciousness, I was completely aware that my life had ended. I remember, after going through the worst time of my life due to the suffocation I was experiencing, the light went out, everything went dark, and I felt great peace. I saw passing before my eyes images of people I love - very rapidly. Suddenly, awake, three hours had gone by. Three hours of which I have no memory, as if I hadn't been alive. I am alive because they gave me pulmonary-cardiac resuscitation and I responded. That day I came back to life.

Thank you.
