PREFACE .
.....................
,.,
W1TB many, to whom swift writing is in much request, a system which, with the legibility of
of common writing, would unite in a considerable degree the brevity and qnickne of Short Hand,
has long been a desideratum; the author flatters himself that his readers will find these useful
properties combined to the fullest extent in the ystem contained in this treati e. Facilography, as
may be seen by the contents of this work, is a system of ea.t1ywriting, not in Short Hand, but of
writing every word, and every letter without any omission, in half the space and in one third
the time required for RJJnning Hand; which is effected by uh tituting new charach>rs for the al-
phabet, and when the alphabet hawonce been perfectly learnt; the letter used in Facilography are
as legible as the letters in common writing, and are made with one third of the trouble; this is
demonstrated in the secoud plate of this treatise, by which it will be seen, that to form the
twenty-six letters of the running-hand alphabet, one hundred and twenty moves or inflecti()nsofthe
pen are required: hut in Facilography the twenty-six letters are formed with only forty moves of
the pen, and written in regular straight Ii\les; hair strokes to connect the letters very seldom oc-
cur; and in the five vowels, each can be formed by a single stroke of the pen.
Some persons may perhaps say, that the writing being contained in half the space that is re-
quired for the common hand, is but of little consequence; this property, however, is a greater re-
commendation than might at first be imagined, for example, is i~not o,ftenfou,nd very unpleasant
to Merchants and others, whose business requires them to carry large books for their memorandums,
a
jj PREFACE.
the bulk of which in the pocket is extremely incommoding; for instead of having the incumbrance
of a book six or seven inches long, and four or five in breadth, will it not be very gratifying to such
persons, to be enabled by the aid of Facilograpliy to write down their memorandums at full length,
in one third the usual time, in a hook not larger in extent than the size of a common playing card 'I
.ABit frequently happens that Merchants and others minute down various matters of consider-
able Importance, and of such a nature as they would not on any account wish to be exposed; such
persons will find another great advantage in Facilography, - which I shall just briefly notice;
which is, that should they at any time lose their memorandum book, or inadvertently leave it open
in any place, they would have the satisfaction to know, that, although the book might fa)l into
vulgar hands, yet no vulgar eye would be able to unravel its contents! there would in this case be
no necessity for memorandum books with locks to them.
To men of business and of literature, profeE1Sional
gentlemen, students of law, students in
divinity, to gentlemen of the faculty, and of every polite profession, Facilography will in many
instauces be found most advantageously to supercede the long protracted hand in common use,
particularly in making memorandums; and might in epistolary correspondence be employed with
especial ad vantage to the literati, whose ideas flow in rapid succession, and whose discussions are gene-
rally very prolix, they will find it preferable to any short hand whatever, for the words being written
in full, there would evidently be no ambiguity, and to those who had perfectly learnt this new system,
it would be equally legible as common writing, and how greatly would it free them from fatigue,
when they woulcl be enabled thereby to write as much in one hour as by the hand now in general
use would require them three ho\11'8
close application : it would be found a most desirable acquisi-
tion to ambassadors and secretaries of legation at the different courts of sovereigns, who have
frequently to minute down almost innumerable circwnstances which are never intended to meet
the eye of the public ; and moreover by enabling them to make their memorandums in one third
the usual time, would not only give them so much more leisure to devote themselvel!Ito other pur-
suits they might desire, but would also aJlow them more time to write the different documents that
must be written in the usual manner with greater neatne s, and thereby prevent their common
writing from degenerating into an inelegant and almost unintelligible manuscript.
The readera of this work are cautioned not to expect, that the forms of the characters
which constitute the Facilographic alphabet, are such as were never before met with, neither
is it reasonable to suppose they should be so ; for so long as straight lines, angles, and curves are
the first principles, not only in the formation of letters, but also in the form of every thing else;
it therefore follows as a natural consequence, that some of the characters used in Facilography will
be foun<lto bear similitude to characters which may be found in several systems of Stenography ;
it is not altogether the shapeof the characters employed, but the general disposition and arrange-
ment of them; which constitutes the originality of the Facilographic alphabet; for had men been
10 scrupulous as not to have availed themselves of the advantages resulting from the various com-

bin:1tionsof straight lines, curves, and angles in making additions, and improving literal charactel'8,
merely because the aame properties bad been previously applied to practice by others; bad thie
been the case, it is evident that all p0&&ibility
of improvement muat have ceased, and the Graphic
art would to this day have remained in the same rude uncultivated 1tate,as at the very fint dilcovery
of letters, upwards of three thoU1aDdyears ago.
The author of the system of writing contained in this treatise, can with truth aver, that not-
withstanding the re emblances before mentio~ed, that be al o invented the characters themselves,
as well as the dispOBitionand arrangement of them, without any reference to books, wherein simi.
Jar fonns may be met with, for the present alphabet of Facilography is the result of more than one
hundred different plans of alphabets, which he drew out so long ago as the year eighteen hundred
and nine; and after having made many tboW1andsof combinations, in order to ucertain the com-
petency of the characters in each respective plan, he selected those, w~ich from their simplicity of
form, quickne s of formation, regularity, beauty of appearance, and eaay lineal combination one
with another, offered themselves as the most eligible for his purpose: so far was he from taking for
a pattern any system of Stenography, that his whole object was to produce a system of writing
words at full length, with Jess trouble, in less time and space ; and yet such as would preserve the
inclination, uniformity,. and lineality of common writing, which might, if required, be applied with
equal ease and advantage, as a short hand; these were the principles which he took forhisguidance,
and bow far be may have succeedP.ilin the e particulars, he leaves to the decision of every impartial
reader, who sb1tllpnu:ticall,r ex.uuiue the a:1ml..
..11t nf tlii 11-..ati ~. hut i ln,pp)' to. 11y,
that in these
respects, he has accomplished more than at first he expected: a simplification of the hand now in
general use, was what he constantly kept in view, and for those letters, which in common writing
required six or se...endistinct risings and falling of the pen, to supply their places with characters,
which can each be formed with only two or three motions of the pen; an elucidation of this will be
seen in the miscellaneoW1
rema.-ks, particularly on those of the letter m, contained in the ninth
cbapter of this treatise,
The author will further remark, that in the formation of characters, three very different pro-
perties are to be considered; viz. simplicity of form, lincality in the manner of writing, and capa-
bility of forming an easy and flowingjunction with the preceding alldsucceeding letters with which
they are combined, and to constitute a character which shall be written expeditiously; two of these
principles at least must be united. That these are very distinct properties may easily be proved;
for characters extremely simple in form, each taken separately, are found in some modern systems
of Stenography, nnd yet they are such as cannot be combined with each other in an easy and
flowing manner, but whose combinations are often difficult to perform, and very unpleuant in
their appearance, full of unnatural joinings and frequent liftings of the pen, and which, instead of
being linear as literal.writing ought to be, t_!ie
words written therewith may be seen very frequently
to assume an appearance of t'h:earbitrary characters of the Chine1e,
0rl gl nHI fnJm
PREFACE.
The three properties before mentioned, as the constituents of an expeditious character, have
been united to the fullest extent in the letters of the Facilographic alphabet, but in a very few in-
stance , where some of the characters might have been more simple in form; but had a greater
deg,-ee of implicity in this ret;pect been attempted, tney would not have preserved their linear
manner of being written, nor have been capable of their pre ent easy and flowingjunction with the
other characters; he therefore thought it better in some measure to reject the first of these princi-
ples, rather than by retaining it loee the advantRg resulting from the union of the two last men-
tioned. Moreover, it may easily be proved, that .an attempt to gain expedition, by carrying the
principle of simplicity in the {onn of the letters heyond a certain extent, will generally defeat i:
own purpose, and this mu t inevitably be the case, whenever simplicity of fonn in the character is
purchased at the expenee of the other two entinl properties already mentioned; but, however,
this extreme has been carefully avoided in this new "Systemof writing, and the chat·aeten of the
Facilograpbic alph bet neverthel s are equally simple in form, and owing to the ea y and flowing
manner in wbich they combine, and in consequence of their being written iu a lineal manner, are
expressed with greater fucility and expedition than the alphabel8 of some of the most modern gy
terns of, teoography~ bicb, hitherto, have been con idered as paragon of perfection in that de-
partment of science; that this is really the case, any person may oon be convinced by only refering
to the cbemes for their alphabets, given in the y terns alluded to, and comparing them with th
characters which cot titute the Facilographic alphabet.
The characters before 11llucfed to, no hoing loM eimplc than the rest, are the characters which
nd for a, 9, and x, as given in the line No. 2, of the alphabet; to a uperficinl observer, these
characters might be supposed to require more time in t_heirformation, than any of the characters
which are found in the treatises of short hand already before the public; but the author has ex-
perimental1y proved the reverse to be the case, and that a penman, moderately expert, can
make from one hundred and twenty, to one hundred and fifty of either of these characters in the
space of one minute; and of other of the characters, from one hundred and eighty, to considerably
upwards of two hundred per minute.
The easy and flowing manner in which these characters combine, gives them a decided pre-
ference over those whi<'hmight appear more simple in form, but which do not possess the property
of combining in flowing and lineal manner; the nrst way of making the character for a, which, if
mad by itself, take three motions of the pen to form it, but will, when combined with the other
characters, scarcely ever take more than two movements of the pen to form it; as an ~xample of
this, the word .JJ-Iartyr,
Plate No. 3, is given, by which it will be seen, that this word is written
with only ten motions of the pen, but if the letter were written separate, they would require ele-
ven motion of the pen; the reason of this is, that the last stroke of the a 1s formed by making the
upstroke of the letter r; in the aIDeplate, and in the word Paris, the letter a takes no more than
one stroke of the pen to form it; Pari,, thus expressed in Facilography, needs no more than severi

motions of the pen, but if the characters were mitt n apart, would tAke nine distinct motions of the
pen. and in all words of a imilnr constructiou, th· character for the Facilographic a will be made
by one stroke of the pen ; but as the author has given two different wa of making th character
for a, both of which are used with the utmost ease, and baa given e amplea and irwtruction for the
application of both ; the one of which is al ays made by one iagle stroke of th pen; therefore the
atudent may use either of them with equal facility; and in reference to the character for 9, when-
ever it enda uay word, it · always written with only two _motiou of the pen.
It may be observed, that the secoud chapter contains the first lesson; the fourth chapter the
aecolld I on , the fifth chapter the third ; the sixth chapter ,he fourth le880n; the aeventll con-
tains the fifth lesson; and the eighth chapter the ixtb I son: wethird, binth. and tenta chaptera

which is added, shewing a speedy method of acquiring a rapid manner of writing the Facilographic
characters; the pupil would do well to attend to the instruction therein contained as oon as he has
gone through the first le on; but those who wish, after having completed the first lesson, may
proceed without delay to the second, (which exhibits the mode of combining the letters one with
another) and so on progressively through the six le sons ; and may attend to the p~ticulars con-
tained jn the third, ninth, an<ltenth chapters, and the postscript afterwards.
As tautology is unavoidable in a work of this nature, the author hopes the candour of his
readers will excuse any thing of the kind which may b4?met with in this treatise.
In consequence of the great ease and expedition with which any thing may be written in full in
Facilography, it will naturally be suggested to the mind, that the same character may easily be ap-
plied as a system of Stenography; this is the ea e. An appendix is given, shewing the application
of the same to a system of short-hand : every thing really useful in Stenography bns been carefully
selected; besides which, a great variety of matter of real utility has been introduced, as will be
quite obvious on perusal ; the rules first elucidated by proper examples in prose, are afterward1,
recapitulated in Terse ; from the we11known fact, that whatever is presented to the mind in the
form of poetry, is more pleasant, strikes the imagination more forcibly, and is easily remembered for
a long time; from the great facility thus afforded to retain the instructions, the author is inclined
to believe, that many of bis readers will commit to memory all the rules given in verse; but those
who may not be disposed to do 1m, will find it amply worth their while to fix well in memory the
rule for the prepositions,• and that for the terminations ;t or if only the rule for the terminations be

perfectly retained, by the aid of this, and omitting the vowels, they will have a short-hand
equal to any; and one thing very essential in short writing, posse ing an advantage not to be
found in any other ystem; namely, that the words are written in straight lines, as is done in com-
mon writing, which renders whatever is written far more clear and legible, than if the letters were
joined in such a manner, that one letter would go under the other, underneath the line, or be car-
ried above the line for several letters together, as is the case in other systems of Stenography: but
those who will commit to memory the whole of the rules, will possess one of the most perfect sys-
tems of short-hand hitherto extant.
And with respect to the rule11given iu verse, they are not intended as any display of po-
etical talent, but oely with a wish to render the work more useful; therefore the author hopes his
readers will not critici e the poetry; for it is more difficult for the muse to descend o the minutiae
of art, than to indulge in the 1mblimeflights of imagination; and it would have been easier to have
written 110 Epic Poem, than to have elucidated the art of Stenography in poetry.

Having provided yoUJSflf •th paper, or a copy ho sufficiently large to
contain the whole alphabet in one line ; rule any number of lines at pleasure hori-
zontally, at about half an inch apart; and then rule from top to bottom of the
paper thirty-three lines.
This done, refer to Plate No. 1, Lesson 1st. placing the copper-plate copy be-
fore you, and beginning with the first letter of the FaciTographic alphabet, proceed
regularly on to the end thereof, imitating as nearly as possible each character, and
at the same time you form each letter, call it by its proper name; by this means
the imagination will assist the memory, and in many instances the whole of the
a]phabet may by diligent application, be perfectly acquired in the space of one day.
NOTE. In the third line of the first lesson, which begins with the word " or,U
some of the characters are repeated with a trifling difference of form ; this line ex-
hibits the slight variation those letters sometimes undergo in combination with others,
in order to preserve ease and uniformity. It shou]d be observed, that in this, as in
common running-hand, the motion of the pen is uniformly from the left towards the
right hand.
Tlie Second Section Explained.
But to remove any doubt from the mind of the learner, as to the correct principle
of forming the letters ; the Inventor has given in this seeond section of the first les-

son, eight of the letters in very large characters: the first of these is the character
for b, in forming of which, the pen is first placed on the paper at the point marked
a, and carried forward to bat the top, and then slanting down from b unto c. The
second is d ; in the formation of this character, the pen is first laid on at the point
marked a, and carried down to b ; from b the pen is carried up to c, which com-
pletes the letter.
The third character is for s, and is formed by carrying the pen from the point
marked a, quite round to the point marked b, which completes the letter. N. B.
This is the kind of s to be used immediately after those letters which would re-
quire the connexion of a hair stroke if the character for s, which is given in the
second line of the first lesson were used: but this is fully explained in the second
Section of Plate No. 2, and also in Plate No. 3, in the word "universality,tt and
several others as may be seen by inspection ; by the numerous examples given in
the plates, it will be seen that this kind of s adapts itself with much nP.atnessand
facility when joined to a, tow, or to u, a.q in the word "zealously." See Lesson
Fourth, PlatP.No. 3 .
When sis the final letter, it may, in most cases, be expressed by a single stroke
of the pen carried upwards in a diagonal direction: see Section No. 4, of the se-
cond Lesson, in Plate No. 1, and the second Section of Plate No. 2, where sis com-
bined in almost every way that can possibly occur.
Fourth Character. In forming the w, the pen is first placed on the point a, and
carried forward to b, by one curved stroke.
The Fifth. The character for f, is formed by placing the pen first on the
point a, and by one stroke to carry it in a curved manner to b.
The Sixth. The character for m, is formed by placing the pen on the point
a, and carrying it from a up to b, and from b down to c.
Seventh. The character for p, is made by putting the pen first on the point a,
and carrying it down to b, and then from b up to c. "
The Eighth is the character for k, in forming this, the pen is carried from the
point marked adown to b, and from b the pen is brought with a fine stroke nearly
up to the point a, where both down-stroke and up-stroke are joined.
Before the learner proceeds to the second lesson, he should make himself expert
in forming all the letters of the alphabet, and be perfectly able to write them with-
out having the copy before him, so that he may with ease distinguish them wherever
they occur.

These directions, I believe, will be found to convey precise and clear ideas how
to form the alphabet.
It is strongly recommended to the student, most particularly those who have
not the advantage of being instructed by the Author himself, that fifteen or twenty
pag s of the alphabet, at least, should be written, or should this not sufficiently
impress it on the memory, more copies should be written until the Facilographic
charact.ers are perfectly as familiar both to the hand and to the eye, as the letters of
the common running hand ; every one wishing to retain perfection in Facilography,
will find it amply worth his while implicitly to observe this injunction : for to every
retlecting mind, it is an obvious fact, that although our progress at first be slow in
the acquirement of science, and should we even spend considerable time in acquir-
ing, in a perfect manner the elements thereof; yet by making ourselves completely
perfect in the rudiments ; every impediment js hereby removed, our progress will
be easy. pleasant__.and certain, every difficulty vanishes before us, and the rapid
proficiency we aftP.rwal'dlt m=tkP-,mnclt more than - compensates for the time and
trouble we bestowed to attain perfection in the first principl9'1 ; l;l.nd there are no
doubi rlow·li ing, thou ands whose hasty impatience, or unconquerable indolence,
would never let them sufficiently apply to acquire the rudiments of any art or
cience presented to them, and ho have therefore given them up as useless or im-
practicable; but it is hoped that every purchaser of this treatise, will have tho-
roughly resolved to follow the lnstructio:ns it contains, and by so doing, may rest
well assured, that he will have the satisfaction of becoming a proficient in, and·pro-
fessing every advantage that can result from this expeditious system of writing.
Third Section.
In order that every person who learns this system may perfectly understand in
all cases l1owthe characters should be placed, it is necessary to make the follow-
ing remarks :-When there is occasion to speak of some of the Facilographic cha-
racters being under the line, it is not meant that they are to be really placed under-
neath it, but the notion intended to be conveyed, is that the characters are begun
on the line, or a very little distance above it, and that the other part of them
finishes, or is made under it, just in the same manner as the letters f, g, ss, p, q,
y, and the long s and the long z in the small alphabet of common running-hand ;
and when it is said that a character is to be carried above the line, it is meant by
a long up-stroke, after the principles of b d h k l of the small alphabet of corn-
Or1
glnal frllm
mon writing, but j is the only let:ter in Facilography which has a long up-str~ke
above the line.
To render every thing clear and easy to persons who learn thi .~system of writ-
ing, I will as briefly as possible give1such directions as will prevent any mistake in
the manner of placing the Facilogr 1
phic character .!
The characters begun on the line, or a little above the line and finished under
it, are those which stand 'for g, h, the long k, the l, p, v, y, z and characters for
qu and for ph.
The characters written entirely upon the line, are those which stand for b c d
e f j m n o r s t w x, long a, long ji, and the long u, the characters for gk, and that
for sh; these are always written on the line, with the exception only of the three
characters for long u, e, and for o; ,when either e or o com s next after the charac-
ters fork, for qu, and for y, both thee and the o, in this ca11e,
are each an up- trok
joined with and brought from the It, or qu, or from they, right up to the line, and
so united with the next succeeding letters without ever lifting up the pen; or when
thee comes next after, and i joined to the char.icter for n, it may be b gun on th
line and made as a downs-troke. SE
ie the manner in which it is written in the word
pine, .fine, &c. in plate No. 1.
The only cases in which the-loil[
g u is begun on the line and finisheli under, ar
in joining it to the characters for b, f, m, and sometimes with that for n. The rea;.
son of the exceptions in these three •1vowels, is, that the writing is by th e means,
rendered more free and flowing, ail d.almost in e ery instance, a troke of the
pen is saved.
One thing to be remark "d i ·, that when some of the character are termed
long, or short, it is not meant thal tbey are to be sounded long or short, it only
refers to th~ magnitude of the characters, and that one requires a longer or a shorter
time to write it as contrasted with the other letters of the same name, but these
particulars wiU be rendered perfectly easy and familiar by copying the examples
contained in the plates.

CHAPTElt JII.
General Observations on the Letters.
ALTJ:IOUGH
the foregoing chapter contains all that is necessary for the first
lesson, nevertheless, as in a work so novel in its nature, a variety of ideas might
suggest themselv.es to the mind of the reader, I hav
0
e been induced in this third
chapter to make ~me remarks on each letter, that every particular may be eluci-
dated in the clearest manner.
a-I have given two ways of making this letter, the first is contained in the
line No. 2 of the alphabet, to which I give the name of long a, in 'contrast to the
other ; no further direction is necessary for the long a, only to make it with a good
free rounding-turn both at top and bottom: the way of making the second a, con-
tained in line No. 3 of the alphabet, is made by a single touch of the pen, it is
used precisely in the same manner as the character which is called short i.
b-It will be seen by inspecting Plate No. 1, that there are two characters for
b: the character for b, given in the third line of the alphabet, is the b whicJ1
should be used when m and some other 0f the consonants precede it, which require
the b to be thus formed, in order that the junction of the two letters may be easy
and flowing; but when a vowel precedes, the b rusgiven in the second line of the al-
phabet should be used; but this will be perfectly plain from the examples given
in the plates: c, f, and 10, are made on similar principles, which have been ex-
plained in the first Lesson.
d-This letter, as may be seen by the examples, varies its form so as to adapt
itself to all the letters with which it is combined ; when it begins a word, it retains
the form given t.o it in the second line of the alphabet ; but when a c f g m n or z
comes next after d, the d is only a little round loop, the last turn of which finishes
towards the right hand, as in the word admonition. See Plate No. 4, and Example
No. 26.
The rounds is somewhat similar, but may always be known by the manner in
which the last turn finishes, which is exhibited in a large character in the second
Or1

Section of the fir t Le~n ; t nd s b1 plate 'O. '2, -and in tbe \'for& gehM
and usary, with several othet" examples ·n 1titts'W'Ork,
will snfficiendy e,te}nptift
thi differtmce between these two letters.
e-Tbis letter is Mtnetimes a down--streke. and sometimes an. up-m-okP,as
suits the convenience of the preceding or succeeding ietter with whicb it is joined ;
when an up- ttoke is fine, but when formed by a down- troke, it is broad and
strong at the top, but goes off finer at the towet" part. Whenever e is written i'n
combination with n under the line, it should be a ~ry &"mall
character, ru1in the
word munerary, &c. e the examples in the plateA.
f-The use of the f, given in the third line of the alphabet, is eXplained by
the example of writing the word profane. See Plate No. 1. .
g-The author has give two ways of making thi letter, the g gi en in the
third line of the alphabet, may be used when g ends any ord.
NoTE-The same gas last spoken of, is u~d as a rennination, when used 'i
short-ha d, may be seen in the Appendix.
The g in the second line -0fthe alphabet, (tts may be seen in the examples} cotn.
bines with m'tt'Ch e and neatne s, with every letter, and in very situation ; how-
ever, care should be taken not to m ke the upper part tuo large; the top of t-his
l~ter i a ery small curve, \ bich 'C rve is not half 'SO large as any oi the other
cm·ved characters.
h-T.his letter i fo!med by a fine up- troke anti a igbt down-stroke, the
loop should be very narrow.
i-This letter in aU ea es, is only a short rong down- troke, wiien two i's
meet together, they may both be wetl e. pre ed by o ly making one short thick
down- trok with a dot over it. The dot is also u ed for i in all combinations, and
by way of distinction, call it hort i; its ai,plication is fully shewn in the second
Lesson.
_j-The fir t cba.racterfor this letter, is a s'trongdown- troke, and houldbe fu!I
twice the length of first mentioned character for i; the econd way of making this
letter is by plaoin he pen on dre line, an. catrying it downwards, and hen an
up stroke crossiug the down-stroke brought right up to the line, completes this
1etter.
k-Two forms fork are given, the first of whif:h is-distinguisb d by t~ name
of short ·1i,and honld always be used at the beginning of words ; the other in the
third line of the alphabet is what is called long ·
k, the first part of which is a down-
strok~, and the second, which completes the letter is an up-stroke, and is generally
D
Or1glrml fn:lm
8
used in the middle of words from its distinctness and facility of combining both
with preceding and succeeding letters; :however, if care be taken to form the short
k carefully, it may be used in the middle of words as well as the long k, as may
be seen by inspecting the miscellanies Plate No. 3, and word No. 3, where I have
used the short k in the word mankind.
l-Consists of a strong down-stroke and a fine stroke, the loop should be very
narrow, as it is not necessary to give the looped parts of the letters in Facilography,
the length and roundness which is given to the looped parts of the letters in com-
mon running-hand : but when p immediately precedes l, the l should in this case
be made a little longer than usual.
m-This letter consists of a fine up-stroke, and a strong down-stroke, and
sho~ld always be made somewhat larger than any of the vowels to which it shall be
joined, that its distinctness may be in all cases pl'eserved; to write em only, re-
quires the lower part of the upstroke of the m to be bent a little hollow towards
the left side; however, this and other combinations of this letter will easily and
practically be learned by copying the examples given in the plates.
NOTE.-As the character for m just spoken of, is made somewhat longer than
the other characters for the reason above mentioned, therefore in applying the Fa-
cilographic characters to a system of short-hand, whenever the letter m occurs, in
aJl cases where the vowels a, e, and o are not inserted in the first part of the m,
the character for mas given in the third line of the alphabet in Plate No. 1, should
be used, which is precisely the reverse of the character for to, and consequently is
made by one stroke of the pen, and should always be made full twice as much
curved as the character for f, so that the one cannot be mistaken for the other.
n-Is a ·short straight stroke by drawing the pen from the left towards the
right-hand. When two n's meet in a word, make the n twice its usual length.
o-This letter is made by a single stroke of the pen, sometimes it is a down-
~troke, and sometimes an up-stroke, as may best suit for its junction, with the pre_
ceding or the succeeding letters, when it is a down-stroke, it is made strong and 1
broad, particularly towards the bottom; when an up-stroke, it is more fine, but in
both cases it is curved and inclined the same way.
p-lt is formed by a strong down-stroke, and a fine up-stroke, it is the reverse of
the character used form, only a little longer and much narrower.
qu- The author uses only one character to represent both these letters ; for
in the composition of our worrls, q and u are inseparable ; the character -hehas first
given, should always be formed by a very strong down-stroke, as much of the charac-
ter being below the line as there is above; the second ~haracter for qu is quite obvious.
9
r-This letter is formed by a fine up-stroke and a down-stroke rather stronger,.
the loop should be very narrow.
s-T he , given in the second line of the alpbabet, is formed by a down-stroke and
an up-stroke, is just the reverse of the cha~ter for the r; and looks very elegant
when used as the first letter of any word which begins a sentence. The first s is a
fine up-stroke.
t-The down-stroke of this letter should not be. made strong, but fine and
quite straight, both the up-stroke and down-stroke should be as close together as
possible.
u-The author has given two ways for making this letter, the first of which he
distinguishes by the name of long u, is contained in line No. ,2, of the alphabet,
and is formed by a down-stroke rather strong, and a fine up-stroke, the character
for this letter should be well preserved, and a good round turn should be given
to it at the bottom; this character may always be written on the line if the
writer desires it ; but in a few instances where the writing is rendered more
handsome and flowing by beginning it on the line, and carrying it downward a lit-
tle, the author has done so, viz. in joining it with b f m, and sometimes with n, as
will be seen in the plates. The short u is made a single -straight down-stroke, broad
at top, but tapering off at the bottom, and i applied in the same way as the dot is
when used as the character for i, and will be best learnt by studying the examples
in the plates.
w-The wshould always be full twice as much curved as the character used
for the letter c; this may be seen by comparing the two letters as given in the al-
phabet.
x.-Tliis letter is somewhat similar to the r and the b when joined together ,
only that it is not quite so long, the two looped parts are closer together, and the
whole of it is made above the real or imaginary line, or wh\ch words are written :
the second character for x is quite obvious.
y-ls always made by a down-stroke of the pen, and is always below the line ,
and the lowest part .very stro,ng and broad.
z-This letter is somewhat similar in form to the m, only tha the upper part is
not more than one half as large, and that the down-stroke is continued below the
line quite straight, so the difference is so striking, that the one cannot be mistaken
for the other.
The characters for ph, gh, and sh, will be quite obvious to the student, who ha
perfectly learned the other characters, for like them, these three, are also formed
Or1glnHI frllm
to
· by the motion of the pen ~in~ continued in 11 direction from left ~ rigbt. The
character for tit, as given in the eighth plate, will be found u efut. By the twenty-
·x characters of the Facilagraphic-alph bet, the writi g may be performed in one-
third the usual time, but in many instances wherein the supernumerary character
are u ed the words ·nbe writt-en in one-fourth, or-even one--fifth the time requit10t'l
for common writing, therefore, as expedition is so greatly increased, .it is presumed
that the ·dilig t student will avail himself of the advantages re ulting from the
w,e of these additional characters.
CHAPTER IV.
SECOND LESSON.
IN this les on is given the combination of the vowels with one another ; tlti ·
will familiuize the mind to the appearance of the vowels, as connected with each
other in the rest of the lessons ; the learner should still bear in his mind tha't both
e and o are made more black and ·trong when they are fotmed by a downst1·oke of
the pen ; but more fine and thin when formed as up- trokes, but yet uot so fi-nea
if they were only hair-strokes used to connect letters one with another. It is scarc ely
necessary to add, that in order to form them when they are up-strokes, that the pen
is laid on the paper on the line, and so carried upwards, a 1d that when they are
formed as down-strokes, the pen is applied to the paper a. small distance abo e the
line and then carried down to the line.
The cond section of this lesson e hibit the union of such of the v-owels as
will admit of being combined in a different manner to what they are in the fir t
section of thi lesson. ·
In the third section of the le son "dregiven six words, viz. pine,fine, give,gave,
d~fine and profane ; in order to elucidate the manner of e:·pre 1.ng e final, by
which it wi11be seen that in many •instances e final may be expre sed without any
additional trouble; as i very obvious in the words give and gave, where the e i de-
noted by only making the up-stroke of the v a little longer, and giving to it a mall
Or1glnllllfn::rn
11
degree of curvature at the top, so that the e is written as quickly as if the v only
had been expressed.
The words profane and palfrey, shew the reason and use of the two forms of.
thef, as given in the first lesson.
Fourth Section.-The line marked A of this section, is chiefly designed to ex-
emplify the manner in which u hould be combined with the letters b, i, ,;, k, r, and
with t; the combination of these six letters with e and with o being here repeated,
is only by way of contrast, and clearly proves that u may be united with i j k r and
t, in such a manner as though each two letters were only one character, be made
with nearly as little trouble, and be so thoroughly distinct, that they could not be
taken for any other letters than what they are intended for.
In the line marked A is also shewn the combination of the round looped s, with
letter a. The fourth line marked C, shews the way of combining se,veral letters,
which are expressed in running-hand in the line marked B ; the line D shews whic4
of the letters may be combined in a manner somewhat different.
Lest any one should be at a loss how to join two letters together, a plate has
been added, in which all the twenty-six letters of the alphabet are combined; those
who have learnt the Facilographic alphabet scarcely need be told, that to find the
combination of any two letters, it is only necessary to look for the first of the two
letters in the very first column on the left-hand side, and that under the other let-
ter, at the head of the plate, and in the square space at the angle of meeting, will
be found the two letters joined : it may al o be seen by the faint lines in the plate,
which letter is above and which below the line, or imaginary line for the writing.-
As 1.ome of the characters combine with equal propriety, two or three different
ways, the number of ways that any two characters might l;>e
joined together, is
pointed out by a small figure ; and the combination which ·is the most frequent, or
that which is effected with the greate J expedition is given in this plate ; those
.squares of the plate which are Jeft blank, shew that the two characters correspond-
ing to the angle of meeting·, are never to be joined, because,the same letters as ex-
pressed by the other characters unite with greater neatness and dispatch. It may
not be amiss to remark, that in three of the Facilographic letters which have their
down-strokes carried below the line, viz. those for It,qu,, and for z, when any other
character is joined after them, the same manner of joining each with the succeed-
ing character, is to be observed, as takes place in joining any of the short letters in
common writing, with any of the long down-stroke letters, viz. by making the pen
ascend again to the line upon the down-stroke itself, without lifting it from the pa-
E
Or1
glnHIfrbm
12
per, this will be cl arty und~rstood by e ry reader, only recollecting the manner
in which the last part of the letter p in common writing is joined to the strong
Sown-stroke or stem of that lett~r ; and wha't renders tbi still more obvious, is,
that the p, used in running-hand, exactly constitute& the three letters qua in Faci•
lography ; and similar coutrtits might be pointed out in many other combinations
of the Facilographic Jette"".
Although most of the combineti®s occur in the examt>les contained in the
other plates, the ~mer would nevertheles find it of service to copy once or twice
the contents t>f Plate o. 8.
Th learner i l'eqtiested to make himself particularly perfect in tile manner of
expressing the letter i in the combinatioh with -the other characters, the manner e •
hibited in Hon o. 4, of Plate No. 1, of e1'pr sittg i when it occurs both imme-
diately before and after any other letter, by only drawing a sbort light stroke
through th letter, similar to the cro ing of the t in co-mmonwriting; will be found
well worth the attention of tho e who d ire the most expeditiO'Usplan of writing,
for by this mean the i is t1tice expressed by one single stroke of the pen, the expe-
dition and great utility of this is shewn in Copy No. 1, of Plate No. 4, in the word
acquisition, and Copy No. 16, in the ,vord acquiring, as the word is 1 peated after
the end of the copy.
In reference to thi second lP~n, I would .reconuttend that the examples be
copied several times, so that perfection be most completely attained in thi before
the learner 9:ttempts the third lesson.
The student ·is particularfy recommended to express il, iv, and lp, in th
.samemanner as exemplified in the fourth section of the second lesson, in Plate No. I.
in whatever words they occur.

The second Section of this Lesson is intended t«>
ebmplify Is 1111d final, al t
d and dd.
The words mines, manes, morals and almonds, m1l shew the nature of thie
words, and the manner in which final s may be expressed by a straight up-stroke.
The word oddness, as written a second time, 1s to shew that it may be as we ~
expressed with the o made as a down-stroke, equally with the o as an up-stroke.
The way of expressing s joined with u in the word minus, vfrtuo~, dangerou ,
genius and usury, is very compact and elegant, being written in a very short com-
pass. The pen when forming a curved line, has, as it were, a natural tendency fo
complete a circle ; this I believe is the reason that the looped s is formed with s11>
much quickness and facility-when either a or u, or u, is the preceding letter.
The second Section of this le son exemplifies s and ss, in se~eral different ways,
and sufficiently proves the utility of having more than one manner of expressing s.
NoTE.-That the up-stroke s would combine with facility with every letter ,
might easily be proved; observations -on this Sllbject will be found in Chapter '1i
:.
and may be seen by refering to the Table of Combinations contained in Plate No. a.
By
the examples here given of d and of dd, it will be seen, that the long top
to the d may be dispensed with, except in those cases where it is retained to re11
l-
der the union of d with the succeeding letters easy and flolfing, as in the examp
of the word bondsman , and in many other instances, as may be seen in the plates ~
The pupil hould copy tt,.eexamples in this lesson several times over, that theJ
r
may be well fixed in the memory.
CHAPTER VI.
FOURTH LE~SON.
PLATE No. III.
TH1S Les on consi ts of words in alphabetical order, the learner having
tain~d petfection in the three foregoing· lessons, will find no difficulty in writing i
the Facilographic ch81'8ctersthe ords contained in this lesson, and having copi
Or1glrmlfram
die words several times, till expert in writing them, may then p1·oceedto the ne:~t
lesson.
NoTE.--ln learning the fourth Lesson, it is not intended that the pupil shoulld
copy the articles contained under the head of " MiscellanieR," in Plate No. 3. .Al-
though many of the words are given in the fourth Lesson, they are again inserted in
the Miscellanies, in order to be more particularly treated of in another part of dais
work.
CHAPTER Vil.
FIFTH LESSON.
'
PLATE No. IV.
THIS Lesson consists of a set of copies in alphabetical order; the pupil i re-
commended to write a page of each copy as given in the plate, beginning
with the copy No. I. and so proceed regularly on to No. 26: by observing this in-
junction, the most rapid proficiency will be made; I could have given a grealter
number of examples, such as remarkable speeches, and the letters of illustrious
personages, for 'the exercise of the learner ; which might have been perhaps more
agreeable to the ideas of some person , but this would have greatly added to the
number of the copper-plates, have much increased the price of the work, but
would not have promoted the proficiency of the learner in so short a time with so
much ease and certainty, as the method I have taken in treating the subject in a
progressive manner, in proceeding from letters to words, and from words to s1en-
tences.
The pupil is requested to bear in mind, that the greater part of the examples
contained in the plate are given in Facilography, con iderably larger than the size
of Fae· graphic small-hand, but most particularly in plate No. 4, where the copies
are given in the round-text ofFacilography; this has been done with a wish of r1
en-
dering every thing as clear and plain as possible, so that every facility should be
afforded to the &tudent in the acquisition of this new system, on most correct
principles: students are recommended to write the copies not more than half the

size of those given in plate No. 4, in the same plate, in the lines No. 27 and 28, are
two of the copies repeated, viz. the Example of the alphabet of copies No. 19
and 25, which is the size I most trongly recommend the student to write the whole
of the twenty-i,ix copies, because, it is the small hand of Facilography, which
in this kind of writing is really equal in size to_the small hand in common-writing,
by which will be seen, that whatever is written in Facilography, scarcely occupies
more space on the line, than about one-third the length that would be required,
were the same words written in the runnino--hand now in general use; and singular
as the assertion may appear, yet it is perfectly correct for to ay, that any thing
written in full in Facilography, is with great ea e comprised in as little space as if
done in the letter-press printing.

PLATE No. V.
In order to shew the Application of Facilograplty to any Subject in Continuation,
the following piece of Poetry is given.
EMMA THE FAIR.
THE last time I visited Emma the Fair,
She did me receive with a prudish cold air,
;Each denial she gave only heighten'd desire,
Each frown that she cast would fresh rapture inspire ;
Her words fly like arrows whenever she speaks,
Quite matchless and charming the blush (!D her cheeks,
The form of her countenance truly divine,
Where the rose and the lily together combine,
Her eyes bright as adamant pierced my heart,
I did unto her my fond anguish impart ;
I implor'd her to marry, but that all in vain,
She said she had resolved a maid to remain ;
I then said dearest Lady unmarried you'll stay,
So that your charms neglected will all fade away,
Enjoy every blessing of life in your prime,
Thus to ba]k me and Hymen, is lavishing time,
Over prudish wild notions for vanity food,
Which will make me unhappy and do you no good.
Now accept of the ring, grant to me your fair hand,
So no longer my generous offer withstand :

SE OT ION, No. 2.
Application of Facilographic Characters to all Languages.
As the adaptation of alphabetic characters is optional, the application of the Fa-
cilographic letters to all the European languages may easily be accomplished by only
considering the number of letters which constitute their re pective alphabets ; for,
supposing that any alphabet consists of more letters than our own, even in this case,
characters very simple in form, and weU adapted for the purpose may be found in
·the Miscellanie of Plate No. 5. As for instance, the Russian language which has
thirty-six letters, a character may be selected for each; and to represent those letters
which eli'.pre simple sound , or for the letters which occur most frequently, such of
th.e characters as are most simple in form shou]d be taken, and for those letters
which occur the most seldom, or such as stand for complex sounds, take the cha-
racters which are le s simple in form ; by thi means the whole of their alphabet will
be supplied by these character , of which the least simple in form can be made with
so few as three moves of the pen, which number of inflections is required to make the
most simple letter in common-writing; and it generally happPns that the languages
that have mor~ letters than our own, is entirely owing to them having some of their
letters, whose vocal power in each, is compounded of two, three, and sometimes of
four simple sounds or letter .
Having shewn the application of these characters t.o languages which have
more, it only remains to shew how they may be applied to those languages which '
have fewer letters than our own, as for instance, the Latin, French, the Italian, the
Spanish, and Portugueze languages, to do which, nothing more is necessary than to
select from the Faeilographic alphabet just so many letters as the respective a1phabet
consists of, omitting the rest of the characters.
NOTE.-Althougl1 it cannot be expected that the students in Greek and He-
brew will relinqui sh the custom of writing these languages in their re p~ctive cha-
racters, they _
would neverthele s find the FaciJographic characters much more expe--
ditiou .

CHAPTER IX.
Remarks on Section III.
PLATE No. II.
HERE i repeated the Facilographic ·and running·-hand a]pliabet , and under
every letter of both alphabets re pectively, is placed a figure h wing the number
of moves or inflexion · of the pen required to form each letter ; some may be anxious
to know in what manner this is ascertained, for whose satisfaction I will explain how
this i effected ; but a there is no nece sity for doing this to every letter, therefore
l elect one in which the inflexions of the pen are the more obviou ; namely, the mof
running hand; to form this letter correctly, there is first a fine up-stroke; secondly,
a strong down-strol e ; thirdly, another fine up-stroke; fourthly, a strong down-
stroke; fifthly, fine up-stroke; i. thly, a strong down-stroke, and in the seventh
place to finish the letter there is another fine up-stroke, so that to form the 1n in
running-hand, no fewer than seven move of the pen are required; but to form the
Facilographic m, needs no more than two moves of the pen; on these principle I
have ascertained the precise number of infle iom. of the pen in the formation of the
different letters of the alphabet, and by referring to Plate:: No. 2, it will be se n
that to write the twenty-six letters of the running-hand alphabet, requires one hun-
dred and twenty inflexions, and that the Facilographic alphabet is written with so
few a forty moves of the pen, which i no more than olle third what is required for
the formation of the former, o that when any person hall have made him elf per-
fectly familiar with, and as competent in writing Facilography a what he is in com-
mon-writing, there cannot be any doubt but that he will write it three times as
quick. As a further elucidation in Plate o. 2, and of the same ection, with a
sentence promiscuously taken, viz. "youth requi e admonition to avoid misfortune,"
I have contrasted this sentence as written in running-hand, and in Facilography, by
which it will be seen, that to write the word " admonition," in common-hand, re-
quires forty-two moves of the pen; but to write the same word with the Facilogra-
phic characters, needs only eleven moves of the pen ; I have placed the number of
Or1glnal from
inflexions of the pen under each rd, by which it will be seen ·that some words
written in Facilography, do somedmes a little exceed one-third the number, and that
other words take not so much as one-third the number of inffexions that will be re-
quisite to write them in running- ] and: the sentence here spoken of requires one
hundred and fifty-one distinct mo fons of the pen to write the same in running-hand ,
but is written in Facilography wi :h only fifty moves of the pen .

Observations on the Miscellanies.
PLATE No. III.
HAVING room to spare in ~
his Plate I have accordingly inserted some ex-
amples designed to elucidate cer -ainparticulars which could not with propriety be
treated of until the learner had go,ne through the course of instruction given in the
six lessons. The words to which we would wish particularly to draw the attention,
ar~ numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c.
The word No. 1, exhibits a light variation of writing the word opportunity;
the o in this word is written wit~ a down-stroke brought back again on the upper
part of the up-stroke of the second p; this word in the example given in Lesson No.
4, is written with the oformed by the top part of the up-stroke of the second p, as it
also is in the other examples; either way is correct; but it will be found generally
both more expeditious and more elegant to write both o and e as up-strokes when an
easy and flowingjunction with th,esucceeding letters will admit of this ; the student
'1aving diligently copied the examples contained in the six lessons, will know when

No. 2, the word study, is written with the s made as a straight up-stroke in•
dined toward the right, and this is a slight variation in the manner of writing the
same word compared with examFle No.19, in Plate NQ.4. ·

. No. 1, is the word abdominal, and is intended to shew the manne·r in which b
and d should be written when both meet together in the same word ;-here we shall
just remark, that as the vowel o comes immediately after the d, the long top of the
d must be retained, which should be the case with all the other letters which may
conie next after d, except only a, c,f, g, m, n and z, or character sh, but when ei-
ther of these letters come after the d, the d is then only a little round loop which
is always distinguished by the turning given to the loop; it is obvious that in thus
writing the d with either of these seven letters, that we have the advantage of ex-
pressing the d by one move of the pen, which prqduces a saving in each case oi one
inflexion, because the first part of the next letter f6rms the last part of the d; this
saving of trouble will be very considerable where combinations of d with these let-
ters take place some thousands of times, particularly when we consider that in
Facilography many of the letters are each of them made by a single stroke of the
I
pen. , .
In the line marked A, the word No. 8, is bundle-No. 9, genius-No. 10.judge
-No. 11, kushaiah-No. 12, run,iing-No. 13, tun-No. 14, te_
n-No. 15, is south-
ward, as a farther elucidation ofSection 4th in Lesson No. 2.
. ~ No: 23, is the word southward; the o, in this instance, is formed by the up-
stroke of the s,· this the inventor considered as the best way of expressing this and
' similar wol'ds ; for this word requires not so many moves of tbe pen by two, as the
same word next above it; the one acquiring eighteen, and the other only ·sixteen in-
flexions of the pen.
No. 17, is the word transact, in which round-looped s is used-No. 16, is the
same word, with the up-strokes, and the a .made nearly twice its usual size-No.
18, the word unusual, with ' the round s-No. 19, is the same word, with the s made
as an up-stroke- o. 21, the word unfoersality, in which s is an upstroke, and the
a nearly twice its usual size, in contrast to the example in Lesson No. 4. ·
No. 22, is the word passover, in which the first s is an up-stroke, and the o is
formed by the up-stroke of the seconds .
.No. 24, is the word slander; this word is written to shew that although there
is a resemblance in the form of the s and of the l, yet there is not the least fear of s
.being taken for the l, nor the l for the s, the one being invariably wrote above, and
the other below the line.
No. 25, is the word munster, when u is the next Jetter after m; the u should
be joined with them, as in the example. Or if the u be united with them, so that
the u and m appear only as one character, in this case the u must be writt n in a
Or1glrmlfr'0m
21 ,
very small character, preserving a goodround turning at the bottom of the u, and
the u to be written under the line, precisely as in the word munerary, examp\e No.
32; and as in musmlman, example No. 33; and as in m,ukche,rry, example No. 34.
The word No. 27, is tire•ome; No. 28, figure; No. 29, nitre; No. 30, mitre;
No. 31, impost. These five words elucidate in the clearest manner the method of
using the character for i, when represented by a dot or a comma, both before and
after any ~tber letter, by which it will be seen, that when i comes before any of the
upright letters, the dot or comma must be placed close to the upright letter on th~
left side; but if i comes after, place the dot or comma on the right-hand side; and
when i comes before any of the horizontal letters, viz. before c, f, 111,x,u, and w,
the dot or comma is placed above ,them ; but it is to be placed under th~m when the ,
i come after them. T~ express ip il and iv, place the dot or comma over the cha..
racters p for land v : to prevent the least possibility of misconception, these misceUa-
nies, and very ample remarks have been added, although the learner, who po sesses
only a moderate portion of diligence, cannot but discern that tbey are practically
illustrated in the course of the examples.
No. 26, is the word widou,; this example is to shew the manner of expressing
oto, in all similar words, by which it will be seen, that by making the fir t or let
hand side of the w, some'Yhat larger- than usual, the o and w botb become as legi.
hie as though they were written as two separate characters.
No. 12, is the word running; by this example it will be seen, that double n
in Facilography, is as di tinct from the single n, ao, in common-writing, and in all
cases equally as legible.
From the examples here given of the manner of writings, it may be observed,
that in order to express the letter before a or u by a single stroke of the pen up-
wards, we have.only to write the a or u nearly twice its usual size when coming im•
mediately after the s; by so doing, the up-stroke s will beco~e an universal cha-
racte~, which may be used in combination with all the letters with the inost perfect.
ease and legibility.
No. 20, is the word industry, in which the up-strokes is used as a contrast to
the same word in the Fourth Lesson. Thill word as written in example No. 20, is
don_
e with so few as only nine moves of the pen ; but the same word iu running-
hand could not possibly be wrote with fewer than thirty distinct motions of the pen ;
thousands of other words would exhibit a contrast equally striking, and prove as
~learly, with what superior ease and expedition they can be written in Facilography
0r1g1rm1
fram
22
than in common lvriting ; but this, and several hundred other examples of words
given in this w0rk, cannot fail of demonstrating the correctness of this assertion in
the most atisfactory manner.
The author now wishes to draw the attention of his readers, particularly to
the words No. 4, o,a~d 6. No. 4, is the word monun,ents; in writing the o and the
e in this word, the pen is only moved so little above the horizontal line of the paper,
inclining a little to the right in making the o, an,d but bent a little to the left in
forming the e, as is just sufficient to indicate tliat it is not intended for mnumnts as
expressed in No. o. The same thing may be observecl in No. 6, the word comme11da-
tions; by which it will be seen, that to express on, when another letter comes be-
fore the o, that it is only necessary to make the beginning or left end of the " a very
little bent, (towards the right-hand side) so that both letters will be formed by a sin-
gle stroke of the pen, and nevertheJess be as Jegible as though the o had been made
strictly according to the text given in the alphabet, ·that this assertion is perfectly
correct, any person may be fully convinced by comparing the word monuments, as
written No. 4, with mnumnt1, Example No. 6.
It may also further be observed, that in combination with the other letter~, the
character for i wiJl be quite legible if made only as a little strong dark spot; this
may be seen by the word imitated at the end of the line marked D. &c.
The pupil having gone through the six lessons, will readily discern, that in
plate No. 3, in the line marked E, is the example No. 1, and in the line D, is the
example No. 2, of Lesson No. 6, ' written after the same free and flowing manner a:.
the word monuments, No. 4, already spoken of.
It is only just for to remark in this plac~, that although in the Rixlessons given
for the practice of the student, the author has closely adhered to the text of the
letters given in the alphabet ; nevertheless as may be seen by the two ex-
ampl~s here spoken of, that after the correct principles of formation of the cha-
racters are by practice well fixed in the mind, Facilography may be written with as
little of stiffness or formality, and with as much greater fluency, compared with the
style of the _
six lessons, as there is between the stiff formal manuscript of a boy
]earning to write at schoo], and the easy and flowing style of a clerk, long practised,
to dispatch the business in a merchant's 'counting-house; and any person who shall
have diligently practised the examples and instructions contained in this work, will
be thereby enabled to write with much ease in Facilography, any subject whatever in
half the space and in one-third the time, that would be required to write the salll8
in common writing.

POSTSCRIPT.
WITHIN a few years past, a mechanical principle has been applied to co~ 1
•
mon-writing, in order to acquire greater quickness and freedom in the execution of
epistolary and mercantile hands.
In order to embrace whatever may be of utility, this chapter is added to she ,
that a mechanical principle may with equal advantage be applied to Facilography.
PLATE No. 7.- SscT. No. 1.
IN the line No. I, are several long straight horizontal lines drawn from the Jett
towards the right side of the paper; in the line No. 2, is the same, only the lines are
shorter than the former; the pupils will find it to their advantage to fill several sheets
of paper with these lines, each of which should be made by a single move of the
pen, and in as quick a manner as possible; this will render it extremely easy to
form the curved characters whicl\ require a kind of horizontal movement from the
left side to the right, viz. those in the lines Nos. 9, 10, and 11.
In the line No. 3, is a repetition of the diagonal up-stroke for the letters, finst
practice the luge size or those on the left side, and afterwards the smaller size give~
in right-hand side of the copperplate ; the same thing should be observed of all d:ile
other examples given in this section of the plate.
In line No. 4, is a repetition of the diagonal s, united with a strong dowin-
stroke for the letter i.
In the line No. 5, is the combination of first a diagonal up-stroke, next is a
short strong down-stroke, nearly perpendicular, and thirdly, a hort horizon iial
line ; which are three letters, viz. s, i, n, many times repeated from the beginning to
the end of this line; the frequent practice of this line will render easy all combin 1
a-
tions on similar principles.
No. 6, is the dipthong ee, several times repeated; the first e is made as an U]f>•
,troke, and the second ea down-stroke curved, and so in continuation to the end of
the line.
H
Or1glnel from
24
No. 7, is a repetition of the dipthong oo, the first o is an up-stroke, and the
econd a down-stroke, and so in continuation to the end of the line. ·
No. 8, consists of a fine up-stroke and a fine down-stroke, being a repetition of
the character for the letter t.
The line No. 9, is the character for c; 10 for w, and 11, for the letter f: in
these three Jines respectively, each character is made by one curved stroke of the
pen, drawn in a quick manner from the left towards the right.
No. 12, is a repetition of the character form, formed by a fine up-stroke, and
a trong down- troke. ·
T
o. 13, the letter a, many times repeated, which consists of, first a fine up-
troke, next a strong down-stroke, a little bent, and thickest in the middle, and
la tly, a fine up-stroke.
No. 14, consists of three letters joined together, namely, d, i, n, and several
times repeated: the frequent practice of this line will render the learner expert in
the formation of d, and also of its combinations witb the other characters. The
frequ~nt -copying of the examples contained in this first section of this Plate, will
be found highly conducive to a rapid proficiency in Facilography.
SECTION No. 2.
An expeditious Method of expressing all kinds of Numbers.
Many persons have remarked, how desirable it would be that figures to
express numbers -should he such as would unite without lifting the pen from
the paper : the Faoi1ographic letters which are adapted to express numbers, if
expressed separately, and the pen lifted to write each character, even in this case
they will express any numbers in less han half the time that is required for the fi-
gures in common u·se; but the series of characters given in Plate No. 7, which are
to be applied to all numbers consisting of two figures, or which are above ten, wi1l
all unite without removing the pen from the paper, and then are written in nearly
one-third the time for the Arabic numerals.
It should be observed, that precisely the same method of writing these Facilo-
graphic numerals, as is observed in writing words in Facilography, and this will be
perfectly easy to the student who has attained perfection in the six foregoing les-
sons, and they will be equally legible as if written separately.
Those who prefer expressing all the figures separate, both in small and in o-reat
numbers, may use the series of characters given for numbers under ten; to distin-
crlglrml fnlm
guish numbers expressed by the Facilographic letters, nothing more is required than
to place a short dash of the pen or straight line over them ◄ Fraction have a line
between the numerator and denominator, as in the usual manner, but the author
flatters himself, that the examples he bas given in Plate No. 7, will render the use
of Facilographic numerals quite easy and obvious.

SEcTION No. 4.
On preserving Distinctness.
AS there is a choice and discretion in the way of using some of the Facilogra-
phic characters as applied to represent the same letters ; the following remarks if
duly observed, will enable the student in all cases, to preserve the greates .t possible
degree of distinctness, and conseq1,1entlegibility.
1. The character fore, when made as a down-stroke, should always be broad
and strong at the top part, but taper fine towards the lower part ; the same charac-
ter, when formed by an upward motion of the pen hould be more strong than what
are called hair strokes, used only to connect letters; in both cases, the character foi:
e should be made curved in a sufficient degree, to prevent the possibility _
of its being
taken for a straight line.
2. The character for o, made as a down-stroke, should always be fine in the
upper part, but considerably stronger at the lower part thereof: made as an up-
stroke, it should be more strong than if it was intended as a stroke only used to
connect letters with ; in either case, the character for o, should be sufficiently curved
to be easily distinguished from a straight line. ·
3. Whenever the b, the long k, the p, u, v, or the cbara~ter for ph, come next,
after the letter m, and are joined to them, the character form, as given in line No.
2, of the alphabet, in Plate No. 1, should always be used; and in forming the cha-
meter for l, the down-stroke should be quite straight, aud the loop formed by the
up-strok~, should be very narrow.
4. The character for t, given in the alphabet, in line No. 2, is preferable foe
its distinctness to the character fo1·t, in line No. 3. And the looped characters
for r, preferable in the same respects to the horizontal character for r,
5. The character for tlie should never be used in any word as pai:t thereof, ex-
cept in the 'very beginning, should the fancy of the student incline to use it in the
composition of such words as tlieology, thereafter, tlierein, &c. &c.
6. The round looped s, sliould be joined as near as possible, both to the cha-
Orlglrml fnlm
26
racier whicb comes immediately before it, and to the character which comes next
after it; this will prevent the possibility of its assuming the appearance of a c oom-
ing before or after it, when it is not intended that c should be so expressed.
NOTE.-These remarks on preserving distinctness, are to be understood as ap-,
plying equally to the Facilographic characters, whether used to write words in fuU,
or when applied to a system of short-hand.
SEcTION No. 5.
·On increasing Ezpedition.
AS wasbriefly remarked in the conclusion of the third Chapter, that words
may be written in one-third the usual time, by the twenty-six letters of the Facilo-
graphic alphabet, &c. I shall here ·speak more particularly how dispatch may be
increased by the use of the supernumerary characters for, and, etcetera, the, for,
ph, gk, sit, th, wh, cl,, and pl.
I. The character for sh may be used to most advantage when the following
eharacters come next after, viz. the character, for c, f, b, n,p, v, w, y, ph, eh, wh,
tl&, and long u and long k; the character for sh, admits any of these characters to be
joined to it in manner the most easy and flowing that could be desired.
2. Although I used the character for qu, which is given in line No. 3, of the
alphabet, in the first Facilographic alphabet, which I invented, at present it is sel-
dom used by me, except in sttch words in which n immediately precedes q, as in the
words enquire, inquest, &c. because the other character for qu, in line No. 2, is
formed by one stroke of the pen, and when in combination with other characters, is
always perfectly distinct and legible.
3. To write the word tlte correctly, in common writing, takes ten moves of
the pen, but the Facilographic character for this same ,vord, only requires two mo-
tions of the pen.
4. The character for th, can be used to greater advantage in the beginning of
words, looks very neat, and is written with so little trouble, as the t; the charac-
ters for ph, pl, gh, and sh, will be found still more expeditious than the same let-
ters of the Facilographic alphabet, and producing, at the same time, a great degree
of elegance in the writing; the way of expressing wh and eh, as exemplified in
Plate No. 6, is most strongly recommended to those who desire the utmost dis-
patch, as for example the word what, and the word which, the first of t~ese words
in common writing takes about nineteen mo'1ements of the pen, and the latter word
Or1glrmlfrcm
17
twenty, or twenty-one motions; but thus expre sed in Facilography, the word aolat,
takes only four, and tlte word which, no more than three motion of the pen f
6. In any words where l immediately follows k, as in the word buckle, &c.
the short k hould be used, so that the ame movement of the pen which forms the
k, will also form the down-11trokeof the I; many of the combinations of the Faci-
lographic letters, will be found to promote expedition on a similar principle, which
the diligent student will readilydiscem, and of which he will, no doubt, avail
himself.
Occasional Remarks.
AS a diversity of opinion prevails even among connoi eurs in expeditious writ-
ing, concerning the use of characters which are written disjunctively, or separated
from the words to which they belong; a few remarks on this subject may be intro-
duced in this place with some degree of propriety.
Some authors on Stenography, have employed one and the same kind of clta-
racter to represent two, three, four, and even five different sounds or letters ; the
letter intended to be expressed by such character in their schemes, can only be know a.
by considering the relative position which that bears to the other cliaracters; suth.
·way of expressing of letter is very objeetionable for the following rea ons :-first,
that altuough we can place a character which is written disjunctively in any relative
position with another, that is also written unconnected with any other letter; yet
we shall find in many instances, ,that we ghall not be able to do the same, when se-
veral cnaracters are joined together.
Secondly, That when a character is written separately, and is only to be known
by the position it bears to the other characters, great care must be taken in making
such character precisely in its proper place, othenvise, it will be liable to be mis- ,
taken for some letter which it is not intended for :-thirdly, That since great care is
required in placing such character,- ill their properposition, it therefore folJ.Jwsas
a natural consequence, that some other character, though not so simple in its form,
and which would combine with the rest of the characters, may be written full as
expeditiously, and will be found to possess a much greater portion of uniformity
and legibility.
I have given characters for three of the vowels, viz, a, i, and u, which can be
written disjunctively, but in whatever position tbese three characters are placed,
J
Or1glnllll from
., I Cl r:tV
•
28
they always represent the same letters, therefore the legibili~y of the writing is not
lessened by the use of them; but, even independent of the use of these three cha-
racters, and by those only which are contained in line No. 2 of the alphabet, every
word can be written without removing the pen from the paper, from the beginnmg to
the end of each word ; the i written as a dot, is the only character which I would
recommend to be used in writing words in full by the Facilographic letters, it can
be used without injuring legibility for the reason just before mentioned, from which,
and its easy formation, I have found by experiment, that the use of it conduces to
greater expedition .

TO THE READER.
T11osE ll'ho ha.ve learned Facilography, will, no doubt, be gratified to see
with what ease it is converted into Stenography ; as they will already have learned
the characters, and have become expert in the formation of them, and it may be
seen by inspecti , that the letters ed in Facil~ ph , are simple in form,
and as easily made, as the characters for the alphabet given in the Systems of Short-
hand, which have hitherto appeared before the Public, as was before observed
in the Preface. Those who have learned Short-hand are well aware, that instead of
the writing being preserved on a straight line (in the manner that running ·-hand is)
that the letters are frequently joined one into another, from the top of the line, and
then carried underneath the line, c:me
'under the other, and sometimes they are car-
ried upwards one above the other for three, four, or five letters together; sometimes
the letters are formed and join d together by bringing the pen in a direction from
the right-hand towards the left, which is quite contrary to the natural movement of the
pen; these it must be acknowledged, are found very serious impediments to persons
learning Short-hand; but in this System, which I now lay before my readers, all these
objections are obviated, the writing is in straight lines, and the motion of the pen is
uniformly from the left towards the right-hand, as in common writing, and this will
be found a practice to contribute very considerably to promote dispatch, and render
the writing much more clear and legible.
I shall now proceed to give such rules and directions, as render this System
applicable to every purpose for which Stenography is required.
One thing I shall briefly notice is, that as I could see no utility in substituting
kin lieu of c, when c soµnds hard, nor of supplying its place with s when sounded
soft, because not even one single stroke of the pen could be saved, nor any greater
expedition gained by so doing, therefore in this System, c is used wherever it oc-
curs in common-writing; where expedition is increased by such substitutions, it is
all very well, as in substituting f for gh and ph, when they sound like f, because in
each of these instances the trouble of expressing a letter is saved; the characters
given for gh and ph, as given in the Facilography, with an expert penman, will be
found sufficiently expeditiom for short-hand, hut those who wish, as far as they can
to deviate from the principles of correct orthography, are as much at liberty to do
soin this new system as by a11yother.

CHAPTER I.
SECTION I.
PLATE o.9.
I this, as in •other ystems of Stenography, the letters of the alphabet and
other characters, will each serve to represent ome word, or words, uch a occur
most frequently, with this advantage, that as we have here the vowels, consequently
a greater number of word can be represented by my alphabet than by theirs.
Note. In every case where the using of a single letter to repre ent a word
would be any way liable to make the reading of what is written in any respect
ambiguous, more than a single letter should be used; but in thi , the experiehce
and discretion of the student will be a better guidance than any rules that can be
written .
. N. B. The Facilographic character for h whenever it is used to represent sh,
should be at least one half longer than when it is only used for h, ee the Plate.
SECTION No. II.
Rules and Examples.
Rule 1.-Correct spelling is not to be attended to, and no more letters should
ever be used than what will serve to convey the sound.
Rule 2.-Where double letters meet in any word, only one of them should be
used, as in the word command, one m only is to be retained, and would be thus
written cmnd, Ex. No. 1, pl. 6; or as in the word giddy, only one dis to be used,
and thus written, gdy, Ex. No. 2, pl. 6.
Note. By those who are desirous of being very concise, the personal termi-
nation of verbs may be omitted, as in lovest, lovedst, loveth and loves, might
always be omitted; and the ed anding of participles may be often omitted, and most

honest,-ly,-ty; temporal,-ly,-ity,; moral,-ly,-ity,-ize, ~c. Also ance, ence, ancy;
ency, ant, ent, antly, eMtly, may be omitted if the preceding part be a complete
word, and of the same signification ; as confide, ence, ently. Whole words may
frequently be omitted without injuring legibility, as the articles a, an, tlte, the
preposition of and than, ·after comparitives, &c.
Rule 3.-The character for c, made twice its usual size, will represent eh, or
chr, in any part of the word; but when it is made its usual size, will serve with
advantage in the beginning of words for the prepositions circum, com, and con.
h, In like manner, made in a chiuacter one half larger than its usual length,
will well represent sh, but when made its usual size, it will stand for th, whether
in the beginning, the middle or end of any word ; but as a character is given in the
first lesson of Facilography for sh, the student can use either, for the use of both is
hewn in the examples.
Rule 4.-h Must never be retained in the beginning of words, as tbe word
honour, the h has no sound, and is therefore rejected, and the following vowel writ-
ten in a very small character, will better convey the sound in honour, thus, onr,
Ex. o. 3, Pl. 6; the same shoul~ be understood of any of the vowels when h pre-
cedes them in the beginning of words.
Rule 6.-The vowels should be omitted, except as mentioned in the fourth Rule;
or when used as dipthongs, 01· as prepositions, ·which cases are explained under their
re pective rules. See the Rules No. 6, 7, and 17.
Rule 6.-J;>ipthongs, or double vowels, in any word may be clearly understood
by writing only one of the vowels ; for a di_µthong beginning a word, the 'Vowel
should be written in a very small character, not more than half its usual size ; but
when expressed in any other parts of words its usual size, or such a size as may
best suit with its combination with the other letters, as in the word oar, written or,
Ex. No. 4, Pl. 6.
Rule 7.---Tbe vowels e and o, in many cases can be written without any addi-
tional trouble ; when this is the case, they may be expressed, as in the word meTe-
tricious, the e may be introduced between the rand the t, by only making the
up-stroke of the t a little curved, this will assist the sound, and the word will ap-
pear thus mretrc, to which must be added, the termination for ious. Ex. No. 6,
Pl. 6. In the word notorious o is in like manner introduced, between n and t.
0rl gl nHI frbm
33
Ex. o. 7. Pl. 6, ~nd as e i introduced between r and m in the word reme~
brance, Ex. o. 9, Pl. o. 6.
Rule 8.-When any consonant not being of the same kind of letter as the first
con onant of word (as expre ed in Short Hand) occurs twice in the satne word, by
Rule 2nd. one con onant only hould be written, but if a dipthong or a vowel come
between the Jike two con onants, both consonants should be written, or one of them '
made nearly twice its proper size will serve.
Example.-As in the word remembrance, here the vowel e come between the
two m' , and would be e pressed rmmb, with the termination for ranee, E . o. 8,
Pl. 6; or rmb as in Ex. No. 9, PJ. 6.
Rul 9.-When a consonant begins any word, and there is a similar con onant
in the middle of the same word, (a dipthong or a vowel between them) in this case
both consonants hould be written, as ,in the , ord momentous, ritten mmnts,
expr ed mmnt with the termination ous added thereto, Ex. o. 10, Pl. 6.
OTE, Dy yllables may by this sy tern, frequently be written with two
letter only for a word, a the word moment would be written, m wi h the termi-
nation for ment.
Rule 10.-If a vowel come between the first ancl second consonant; the first
consonant should be no more than half its proper ize.
As in the word command, o comes between the c and the m, and hould be
expres ed, as in Ex. No. 1, PJ. 6; or as in meritorious, Ex. o. 6, Pl. 6.
Rule 11.-If a vowel come before the fir t consonant, the first con onant mu t
be written its usual and proper size. As in the word additional e pre ed d hnl
that is d with the long has the character for sh and nl joined together, Ex. No. 12,
· Pl. 6.
Rule 12.-The pen should not be taken off the paper while writing any word,
except to express the di Joined terminations, and even then but a very little distance
from the rest of t~e word.
Rule 13.-G and h meeting together when sounded like fare not to be written;
f mu t supply their place, as in the word laughing, it should be written lfng or lf,
and the termination ing thereunto added, Ex. No. 14, Pl. 6.
Rule 14.-Ph when together sound like.f; f must be used instead of them, as
in pliilosoplter written flifr, Ex. No. 14, or with the prepositional f for the fl,
Ex. No. 15, Pl. 6.
Rule 15.-,S, when this letter is used as a termination to ·any word, it may be
well expressed by a ·:finehair stroke made very straight, by carrying the pen upwards
Or1glrlllll from
V
34
in a diagonal manner ; the same as the terminationnl s used in Facilograpby, as in
the word preserve written prs., or with p as preposition for pt·, and the termination
for serve. Ex. No. 16, PI. 6.
Rule 16.-ln conformity with Rule 1st. b and to may be omitted in many
words, and this without -injuring either the sense or the sound, as in the word
plumber, written plmr? or write the prepositional p, for pl to which join mr, see
Ex. No. 17, Plate 6, or Ex. No. 18, or as in the word fellow, written jlo, Ex. No.
19, Pi. 6, or with the prepositional f for jl, Ex. No. 20, Pl. 6, or as in the word
answering written nsr with the termination for ing added thereto, and may be
expressed, as in Example 21st. or Example 22nd. Plate 6, either using the up-stroke
s or the other s, as suits the inclination of the writer. D may al o be omitted in
many words, as in bondman may be written, bnmn. ~c.
Rule 17.-TuE PREPOSTTIO• The:Nowels used as prepositions must be their
usual and proper size. ·
By making the consonants one half larger than they are usually made, in pro-
portion to the rest of the writing, they will serve to express the double letters and
prepositions contained in the following table.

SECTION III.
THE RULES IN VERSE.
The metre bein"' vatjed in the following Poetry, was done with a view of preventina-any p r of one rule being-
taken as part of another, 'and as having a tendency to render the whole more impre ive on the memory.
RULE~-
Those who in · hort Hand would succeed,
Of spelling words correctly must not heed,
As needles letter in our word abound,
.e only such as will convey the -ound.
RULE II.
When in a word two letters of one kind,
If spelt correctly would be both combined,
But in swift writing with much ease we may,
By one of them the sound and en e convey,
That you this rule may clearly under tand,
We find the m twice in the word command,
Which in short writing thus e press'd would be,
In proper characters c m n d.
RULE III.
Cli, or chr by letter c
Made twice its usual size express'd may be,
C made its mmal size, then if you please,
Will com, or con, or circum shew with ease ;
As h beginning words does never sound,
As a fir t letter let it not be found,
Made one half larger for sh ~e kno·w,
Buth its usual size th ,~ii\ shew.
RU~E IV.
When h does not sound by the third rule you ee,
Jn beginning of words it omitted must be;
But instead of It write the vowel succeeding,
A Jetter quite small, 'twill make easy the reading.
L
86
RULE V.
Omit the vowels when you swiftly write,
And this will much the labour expedite,
Except when they for prepositions stand,
And then they are retained in this Short Hand.
RULE VI.
And .when they're used dipthongs to express,
The vowels then are made full one half less,
Beginning words, this only is the case,
But their just size in any other place:
One vowel for each dipthong then write down,
Sufficient quite to make the sense oeknown,
Since in most cases, ('tis well known to you,)
One vowel's only sounded of the two.
RULE VII.
In many cases o and e, ~
Witho~t more trouble wrote may be,
As when we form the upstroke of the t,
And as we curve the upstroke left or right,
The o or e presents itself to sight,
RULE VIII.
Two consonants not the same kind,
As the one we first in the word wrote,
When both consonants are combined,
'Twill a vowel between them denote,
Or if you would be more concise,
And your writing still shorter to bring,
One consonant near twice the size,
Will precisely denote the same thing.
RULE IX.
When with any consonant a.word shall begin,
A like consonant follow (a vowel between,)
Both the consonants you in this case should expres11,
Not forgetting that you make the first one half less.
crlglrml fnlm
37
RULE X.
In any word as written in Short ~and,
'Twill be of service for to understand,
Whether a vowel should be understood,
The consonant first written to precede,
Or when between the two con onants we should ,
Although not ritten there a vo el read,
For when the first consonant is made one half less,
That a vowel comes after it then will expre .
RULE XI.
When ever the first consonant is its just size,
That a vowel precedes it then aptly implies
RULE XII.
The pen from the paper ne'er lift,
Until the whole word you have pen'd,
Nor only a small di tance shift,
To write th' terminations at the end.
RULE XIII.
When g and h like f do· sound,
Letf supply their place.
RULE XIV.
Pk when they're together found,
Usefin either case.
RULE XV.
A straight fine up-stroke always serves for
When used a termination to express.
RULE XVI.
,vhenever b and to do'nt spund,
Omit them in such words as they are found .
RULE XVII.
THE PREPOSITIONS .
As you desire what will .to speed conduce,
You'll find the prepositions of great use,
Or1glnHIfrom
38
Th.at uncouth rhymes may useful prove you'll grant,
Therefore let a stand for abs, adv, or ant,
E stand for end, ent, entr, or enter,
And i for ind, int, intr, we prefer,
0 may also stand for out or over,
Under or uni we by tt diseover ;
As prepositions used (to be concise) ~
The vowel must retain their proper size,
But ,;ith the consonan~s 'tis otherwise,
Bl or br we must show by b,
Cl, and cltr by letter c
Made twice its usual size, (expressed may be)
C made its usual size, then if you please,
\Viii com, or con, or circum shew with ease,
D for dr or .dis will serve _
as well, ~
F likewi~e will expressfi·, jl
And g will always shew 91·, gl,
As h beginning words does never s'ound,
As a first letter let it not be found,
Made one half Jonger for sh we know,
But Ii its usual size tit will shew,
J thus may stand for jea, jeer, just, or jes,
K, kl, kr.-L, Zan, or lat express;
M stands for mis, mag, magni, or multi,
And n will also nat or non imply ;
P, pl, pr,-q, for quie, q11,er,quar,
Recom, recon are both expressed by r;
S, stand for satis, sub, or for super,
By t, tr, tran, trans we may infer ;
Val, ver and ves by v are made appear,
W shows wh or where ;
X doth ex, exdm, exem, avow,
Y, yon, yes, yester,-zeal by z we shew.
Thus you see what each consonant implies,
Wrote one half larger than its usual size.

CHAPTER II.
SECTION I.
Rule 1.-In following a rapid speaker,. a great number of words, a the articles
the, a, or an; prepositions and sometimes pronouns may be omitted, and yet the
whole substance of the discourse be taken down,: these omissions may be supplied
afterwards, when the writer has leisure.
Rule 2.-All the punctuation required in Short-Writing, is to leave more blank
space wherever a pause occurs, tban what is left between any two words in other
parts of the sentence.
And when a discourse or any part thereof is put in form of a question, the note
•of interrogation should be added. ·
Rule 3.-In reading what is written in Short-Hand, every consonant should be
~unded full and strongly; this will suggest to the reader what vowelswere omitted,
_andgreatly assist in deciphering what is written.
Rule 4.-Draw a line under such words or sentences as are repeated.
If a sentence which has already been written, be again repeated in any other
part of the discourse, write the two first words of ~uch sentence, to which add the
character for et cetera. ·
Rule 5.-When numbers are to be expressed, the Facilographic Figures sho~d
be used; and will be found the most expeditious, and better adapted for the
purpose than any other characters. .
Rule 6.-TERMINATJONs.-The terminations of words should be written but a
very small distance from the ether part of the word, disjoined and only so little
distance above the line, (on which -the rest of the word is written) as will serve to
distinguish them : ·
Except the characters for h, l, q, and y, which should retain their usual places,
the same a Facilography.

And these omissions when the writer has leisure
May all be inserted with much ease and pleasure.
RULE II.. I
We need no ot r p11D.Ctuation
When we're writing of Short-b.md,
Between two words more space th
AptJy for a pause will tand,
Whenwe pu.t jn form of question
Any part of an oratfon
Indicating this suggestion,
Add the 11ot.e
intexrogation.
RULE III.
Sound each consonant strong, you may thenunderstand,
With much greater ease what you wrote in Short-hand;
This will greatly assist to suggest to the mind,
Both the vowels omitted, and what is their kind.

Underneath it draw a line,
And a sentence -once completed
We with equal ease define.

I wish the learner well to understand,

For greater ease and to prevent mi take,
A small exception in this rule we make.
H, l, q, y, for to l?e brief and plain,
Their usual places ever should retain ;
And when ss shall finish any word,
One singles should always be prefer'd,
Not di goin'd, but with the word connected,
And with ease may then be recollected.
SECTION III . .
Contents of tlie Stenographic Plates.
PLATE No. 6.
A twenty-two of the examples in this Plate have already been mentioned as
'the examples to illustrate and accompany the rules, it will only be necessary for to
make a few remarks on the rest; beginning with E ample No. 23, lfhich is the
word theology, No, 24 anathema; h in both these words is written its usual size,
N
Or1glrmlfrom
4it
and is used to represent tl,, agreeably to Rule No. 3, of the first chapter of this
appendix, and in contrast to the long k used in -writing the word additional, (Ex.
No: 12.) by which may be seeQthat h will serve to express both tit and sit, without
the least fear of one beiag taken for the other. The examples in this Plate also
prove that when any ter shall belled as a preposition by being made in a larger
character than usual, 1t is so distinct that it cannot be · taken for the satne letter
when not intended to represent a preposition, as may be seen b the word pleased,
which is written twice over, first without and in the second place (Ex. No. 29) with the
preposition, as in the whole of the words which are written twice in this Plate ; they
also demonstrate the utility of both the prepositions and terminations as here used; by
which words may be written in ~ most concise manner that is possible, and yet be
as legible by this syst by any other whatever.
The miscellanies are obvio , and we have only to 1·ema:rk,that the character for
sdr, or for str, may be used with adva.ntage as the same cannot be mistaken, there
being no combination of the F ilograp ic characters that will resemble it; the same
observation applies to the eh raeter given for tlir, and that for rt!,,, &c.
No.59 is the word church, written with c t ice its usual sue for the preposition
chr, and with c its proper size, as tbe termination eh ; so that these two characters
, agreeably to the rule do fully expTes., chrci; the same is further elucidated in the
word churchman, No. 60, where it should be observed that as the second c is not a
termination it is therefore made twice its usual size, by the third Rule, Chapter first;
Nos. 61~ 62, 63',64, aud 65, serve as examples of the utility of c used as a prepostion.
The word No. 64, charity is expressed with the prepositional c for chr, and y
for ity agreably to the Rule for terminations; the word charitable, No. 65, in like
manner expresses chrt, to which is addedb as th termination for able.
The easy legibility and extreme conciseness ~f the whole of the examples cannot
but be quite obvious to every person who has learned the rules ·in this treatise.

.A. Letter against Waste of Time.
Convel'se often with yourself, and neither lavish your time, nor suffer others to
rob you of it; many of our hours are stolen from us, and others pass insensibly
away; but of both these losses, the most shameful is that which happens tlirough our
own neglect. If we take the trouble to observe, we shall find that one considerable
part of our time is spent in doing evil, and the other in doing nothing, oz in doing

what we bould net do. W&don1
t seem to know the va'iue ol time, nor how precious
a day is, nOt'do, we consider thai every moment brings us nearer to our end, Re-
flect upon his, I intreat you, and keep a trict account of time. Procrastination is
he mo t dange,ro s tlnng in life. Nothing is properly ours, but the instant we breath
in, and all the re t is nothing; it is the only good we po ss ; but then it is fleeting,
and the first comer robs us of it. Men are so weak that they think they oblige by
giving trifles, and yet reckon that time as nothing, for which the most grateful
person in the world can never make amends. Let us therefore con ·ider time as the
most valuable of all things, and every moment spent without some improvement in
virtue, or some advancement in oodness, as he greatest sublunary loss.
The Lortfs Prayer.
Our Father which art in heaven; hallowed be thy name ; thy kingdom come;
thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven : give us this day our daily bread, and
forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; lead us not into temptation, but
deli ve• us from evil : Amen..
Dr. Mavor in his sy tem of tenography has written the Lord's Prayer ,with
•bout 123 di tinct charact~ ; it i&here written with 80, the difkrenee is 43.
The letter inst waste of time is also one of Dr. Mavor's examples, he uses
about 626 di tioct chan..cters, it is here ritten with 401, the difference is
124.
That this is as equally legible as Dr. Mayors will be perfectly evident to every
one who has learned Facilography and the rules in this Appendix.
I shall ere remind the reader that not even a single word is omitted in these
o specimens of Facilognphic Short-Hand, and moreov r I have not made use of '
arbitrary ymbols instead of words, they are nevertheless more concise than by som~
systems which make use of symbols, &c.
The Lord's Prayer as written in Plate No. '1, requires .JU> motions of the pen,
and the letter against waste of time, takes 564, total 679 Il\Otions of the pen ; to
read these two piec s with propriety require three minute& tim_e; now it is well
known that an Ol'dinary penman can make fr<>m2~ to about 350 movements of the
pen in one minute, but if he be competent in Short-Hand, as mentioned in the
concluding part of second Section of 3rd Chapter of this Appendix, he will not
need to make more than from 226 to about 230 motions of the pen in a minute, to
enable him to follow a speaker.

Agreeably to the note on i creasing expedition, m the 1st. Section of 3rd.
Chap ter of this Appendix, I can rite the Lord's Prayer with 84 movements of the
pen, and the letter against wast ~of time with 4f>5, total 539 motions of the pen,
by which no more than about 180 movements of the pen, would be required per
minute to follow a l'apid speaker
CIIAPTER III.
SECTION I.
On i: creasing Expedition.
Having given·some direction,s on this subject in the Facilography, I shall here as
respects the Stenography be very concise; when t is expressed singly, the t cont~in-
ed in line No. 2 of the alphabet, is sooner made than the horizontal tin line No. 3;
but when you have occasion to express tr, the two horizontal characters for these
two letters wpl be more quickly made than the upright characters for the same; the
character for th, when joined with horizontal r is full as soon made as the r can be
' when written alone ; the charact,er for the used in Facilography may also be applied
to Stenography with advantage, and will improve the legibility of what is written ;
it may also be advantageously used as the first part of any word, beginning or
l1aving the sound of the in the fi,rst syllable; the character for m given in the alpha-
bet in line No. 3, may be used in1Short-hand, when distinctness will not be lessened
by its use, agreeably to what has already been said in the Postscript to the Facilo-
graphy, theg containedin li'ne No. 3 of the alphabet, should always be used when-
ever g is expressed singly, or wh~n it is used as a termination. The a given in the
same line of the alphabet shouldl always be used as a termination, &c.
In many instances expedition may be incteased without injuring the legibility,
by expressing only the first syllable, or the first letter of words, when the col}text
will point out the signification, as in the following sentence, " he was reading the
Parliamentary debates at the tin11e
w.e saw him in the Coffee House," in long hand
would be sufficiently legible if written thus, he was read the Parl deb at t we saw
0r1g1rm1
fram
47
him in the coffee b, and to those well versed in Short-hand would be equalfy clear
if only expressed in the characters for the following letters, h, w, rd, t, prl, db,
a, t, wn, w, sw,' h, 1,,t, kff, h.
Note. As vowels never need oe used in following a speaker, (except when
used for prepositions and terminations,) those who desire to increase expedition
still more, may supply the place of. l '"·ith that of the character for the Facilogra ..
phic o and the r, with that of the character for e, and t by a short strong
down-stroke made quite perpendicular; the character called long i may supply the
place of d, and when dd occurs in any word, make the same character twice its
usual -length ; the character for c may supply the q ; s will serve both for s and for
z; the character forf may also supply the place of bothf and v; the long u may
serve for p, and the Facilographic p for pl; the l and r ofFacilography will serve, the
l for sh, and the upright r for tlir; c when sounded hard, ~ay be supplied by k,
when sounded soft by s ; the character called long k will serve for sdr, or for str,
and x may be supplied by the character given in Section U. of Plate No. 9. The
characters to be joined precisely in the same manner as in Facilography ; by this
means the wbole of the consonants which occur most frequently will consist
of Facilographic characters as expeditious as possible, preserving the most perfect
lineality; in which case the vowels whenever they are used, must be written disjunc -
tively, with the c,haracters for given them in Plate No. 9, Section II.
SECTION II.
Remarks on Follotving a Speaker.
Some authors have asserted that their respective systems would enable persons
of tbe meanest capacity, and such as can scarely write their n~mes in common wri-
ting, by a few hours practice to follow the most rapid speaker; the absurdity of such
assertions must be obvious to every thinking mind ; I have no hesitation in declar.
ing that howeve,rexcellent any system of Short-hand may be, that even the best
capacities and the most expert penmen could not attain to any such perfection by
only afew liours practice ; some weeks if not even some months of diligent study
and application, are in general indispensib]y requisite, even for them to b~come
- every way competent to.follow rapid Speakers; the achme of perfection in any art
or isciencecan never be attained in a few hours only ; what then must become of the
0
Or1
glnal frllm
,
48
proficiency made in a few hours by mean capacities and bad penmen? It would in-
deed be true to say, that a knowledge of all the essentials of Short-hand may be acqui.
red in a few hours; but to attain perfection in their application, must, most assuredly,
be a work of some considerable time and diligence. Added to which, the writer
must not only be an tlXpert penman, but must also be (}Uitefree from nervous affec.
tions, be perfectly composed in himself, possess a considerable portion of assurance,
so as never to be the least embarrassed by being in the presence of any company, how-
ever numerous; his attention must be ever on the alert, and his hearing very good; he
must not only be thoroughly acquainted with the theory of the abbreviating rules, the
prepot;itions and terminations, but must be perfectly expert in their practical appli-
cation in every word which can possibly occur, these qualifications combined are
absolutely requisite in order to follow a rapid speaker.
Before I conclude this Section of my remaTks, I take this opportunity of once
more recommending in the strongest terms, that all persons learniQg Short.hand,
should spare no pains in attaining perfection in the use of the prepositions and ter-
minations, the utility of which they may rest perfectly assured will ampt1ycom-
pensate for the trouble bestowed in acquiring them. '
SECTION III.
Miscellaneous Hints and Observations.
I shall now lay before my reader a method by which any person may soon ac-
quire a habit of writing words in a very concise manner, which will very much
familiarize the mind to the principles of writing Shor.t-hand; which is to take a
Dictionary, or even a common Spelling Book will do as weJJ, in which t~e words are
arranged in alphabetical order ; begin with those consisting of two syllables, write
them down in rotation, word by word, stripping them of the vowels, writing only
the consonants in the Facilographic characters. Write them also. with the preposi-
tions and terminations, which will render the words as concise as possible. This
instruction, if the student will practice it, will be found to answe1· the purpose
much l:,etter than to copy speeches and essays, as is commonly done, as soon the Pupil
has learned the alphabet; but by thus first applying it to words, will render its ap•
plication to every other purpose more easy, certain and J>leasant than could
Or1
glnal frllm
49
have been imagined, Speeches, Letters and Essays may then be attempted with
much pleasure and advantage ; and more real proficiency will be mad-wn less time
than by any other method. Many on perusing this may be ready to say; that it is
Somewhat ingular that a method so very easy, had not before been made known
to them ; I belie e that it m:ty be with confidence as erted, that it bas never before
been made public, and that this mode of rendering of Short-hand a very easy acqui-
sition, is entirely my own; for no person ever communicated it to me, and I never
met with any thing similar in any treatise on Stenography, although I Jiave perused
all the treatises ,~hich are considered as works of merit in this department ofli terature.
Another thing which will be found amply to repay the trouble, is to have the
paper previously ruled with lines the fourth or fifth of an inch apart.
Pale blue ink will do best for this purpose, this will not Qnly give the writing a
neat and uniform appearance, but will also ihsure a regular number of lines of wri.
ting, and moreover will be found so very useful in reference to the manner of writing
the terminations.
In order that every thing might be elucidated as clearly as possible, all such
words as admit of being expressed more ways than one in this system of Short-hc1µd,
are accordingly written two or three different ways, as the word command, may
either be written cmnd, or kmnd, ~c. as may be seen in Plate No. 6.
In one or two instances a few lines of the same words are repeated, as the re-
marks on the letter h, contained iu the latter part of Rule No. 3, of Chapter I. in
Poetry~ will also be found in the Rule for the prepositions in verse, because in reality
the same words constitute part of two rules, which are entirely distinct and inde-
pendent of each other.
The following Rules in Poetry, iz. 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, of
the first Chapter, and Rules No. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, ef the Second, are of the most im-
portance to be committed to memo~y.
To prevent any po sibility of mistake, the prepositions spoken of in Rule No.
1, Chapter II. are the words to, of, by, for, in, ~c. though it would be improper
to omit them in common writing, yet they may be omitted in Short-hand whenever
the context .will point them out, as in this sentence; "he was a Prince of the House
of Lancaster," this would be sufficiently clear in Short-hand if written, "He was
Prince House Lancaster" ; the inseparable prepositions, contained in the table of
Chapter I. to be used for the beginnings of words, must never be omitted.
Those who would wish to be particular in punctuation, after the ll'l'iting 1s
finished may conveniently write them in red ink.
00
For writing Short-band the ink should be blackest and clearest that can be
procured , that every letter may appear d!stinci ~e instant it is formed; the pen
should be made of a crow quill, or a common pen ay serve ,with the nib much finer '
and harder than is used for common writing; but ise's Steel Pens, are in every
1
·espect pref erable; if a black lead pencil, a very hard one, of such a quality a
Brookman and Langdon's, marked H H H will best answer the purpose.
A General and Concluding Observation.
Although the preceding pages contain such clear and precise rules as cannot fail
rendering this the most universal and consise system of Stenography of any ex-
tant; yet there may be some of my readers not inclined to give themselves the trouble
of learning them, though indeed that is very trival from their being presented in the
form of Poetry; to such it ,will be satisfactory when informed, that by using the
Facilographic characters, and only omitting the vowels,and one consonant out of every
double consonant, (in words were two consonants of the same kind meet together,)
they will have a very easy and concise Short-hand, applicable to most purposes to
which Stenography is generally applied.
