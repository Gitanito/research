    Summary: &nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Healing Voice, The.
 The Power of Prayer, Faith Literature and the Science of Healing.  Proving to the World that a Living Faith Gives Us a Practical Christianity.
 1884  Monthly
 New York, NY.  Publisher: Press of J.N. Johnston.  Editor: Anna J. Johnson.
 Johnson, according to her Religious Experience and Gifts of Healing (Chicago, 1878), had been a successful business woman until swindlers impoverished her and she turned to God.  In trance she received, in verse, God's message of faith and turned to faith healing.  The journal was published in monthly parts and consisted principally of self-promoting accounts of her "religious experience," her abandonment of Catholicism, and her exhortations on "Woman's Mission in the Kingdom of the New Age."  It also included, notably, the reprint of an early (1884) letter of John Hamlin Dewey, "Testimony of a Physician."  Faith Healing," on his path to New Thought.  Johnson was still active in 1904 when she took part in one of the early New Thought conventions.
