The only way to fix this heart disease is by ablation, which is surgery where the surgeon removes the extra pathway in the heart that the blood pumps through. I was under in a conscious sedation. I felt sedated to the point where I did not know what was happening to me but there was a moment when I went into ventricular tachycardia - where the heart speeds up so fast it causes a heart attack. Even under the sedation, I felt a small amount of pain but when my heart starting going into ventricular tachycardia a peace came over me. 

I became fully aware of my surroundings I could feel the shell of my body and my spirit began to rise; an extreme peace came over me. As my spirit began to rise the doctor shocked me and then again and my spirit stopped and went back into my body and my state of mind went back to being sedated. I felt complete peace no worries about anything and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.
