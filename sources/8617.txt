If Morning Never Comes,    by Bill VandenBush, Old 101 Press, 13680 North Sandhill Drive, North Platte, NE&nbsp; 69101 (2003).

Summary on the inside page,  &quot;A soldier's story of his near-death experience in Vietnam and the insights and lessons learned from his excursion into a dimension of enlightenment.&quot;&nbsp;

One day about a year and a half ago, I met Bill in person.&nbsp; I was astounded by the warmth in his handshake and the spirit in his eyes.&nbsp; For a moment, time stopped; so I could truly appreciate what a gift Bill was to the human race.&nbsp; Spirit told him to speak, to tell the story.&nbsp; Remarkably, despite having no vocal chords, Bill does tell his story.&nbsp; Since that time, he's had   a big fan - me.&nbsp; 
  
  I attended a talk that Bill gave at Seattle IANDS yesterday and got his book.&nbsp; Today, I read the whole thing - it is that captivating!&nbsp; This is a book of human triumph, every bit as much as it is a triumph of the spirit.&nbsp; This book is for people who have been physically broken, spit upon,&nbsp; and emotionally tortured.&nbsp;   This is a book of courage, patriotism, and honor; A warrior's tale if there ever was one.&nbsp; It speaks of the difficulties of re-integrating with life in the U.S. from the perspective of a Vietnam veteran who went in as a naive boy of 18 years old and came home as a man a year later.

I agree with Shannon Anderson when she writes on the back of the book, &quot;Bill is a living breathing miracle.&nbsp; His compelling life story serves to illuminate the path between merely existing within the awareness of life's impermanence and a consciously chosen, awakened life, centered on the journey home to his truest self.&quot;&nbsp;

And . . . don't forget to mention the near-death experience, which is the other aspect of integrating the reality of what he saw on the other side of life with our waking reality on earth.&nbsp; Spirit walks with him daily and he isn't just saying that in the book.&nbsp; You can tell when you talk with him that he's the genuine article.&nbsp; I would heartily recommend this book to everyone, as it hits a very human chord common   in   all of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
