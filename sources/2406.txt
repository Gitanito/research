PREFACE
To all sincere souls who desire to demonstrate the powers
of the Christ, this work is lovingly and sincerely dedicated. It
will reveal to all who have an unbiased mind the sunlight of
Eternal Wisdom and the healing power of Infinite Spirit. The
star of the Wise Men of all ages will light the way of the seeker
of Truth to primal Christianity which "healed the sick, raised the
dead and gave victory over the grave" to Christ Jesus. All who
can comprehend His message and live the life Divine can likewise
gain victory over the grave.
The author is the founder of Super Mind Science, a Science
of self mastery, healing and soul realization. H e discovered the
laws of life and the power of mind while in bodily distress and
in need of healing. Since that time, he has labored to establish
Schools and Churches based upon facts and demonstrations of
the Godly powers inherent in man, not on beliefs. This volume
of ·philosophy and Truth concerning God, man and the Scrip-
tures, the first in a series of volumes on the subject, has been in
demand for many years, and it was this demand which partially
inspired the author to write.
The author studied most of the world's Bibles and religions
and traveled for years in order to contact the world's greatest
metaphysicians and Mind Scientists. He is indeed indebted to
India and her great teachers for his own first enlightenment re-
garding Divine power, which was the stepping stone to the
discovery of Super Mind Science.
Criticism naturally comes from those who cannot compre-
hend the vastness of this Science or from those who have not
studied it. However, personal opinions and beliefs matter very
little, for only those who can demonstrate the Science are quali-
fied to judge. The author only asks that the reader have an open
and unbiased mind and that he use reason when he peruses this
volume. Then the profound Truths revealed herein will unfold
to his consciousness just as light comes after darkness.
That the blessings of Truth, Love and Light be with the
reader who is patient enough to read and mentally assimilate
this unusual revelation of the Science of Life, is the sincere wish
of the author.

CHAPTER I
DIVINE MIND
Mind is universal, a power which alone
manifests God. The W ill to do good is the
highest power of mind, it regenerates the
world, lifts up the fallen, heals the sick and raises the dead.
Sacrifice and self immolation with high aspirations is the golden
key to contact with the Divine Mind, which is All-pervading,
blissful Infinite Spirit.
Genders This Divine Mind has two aspects, positive
of and negative. It is natural that the pos1t1ve
Mind should lead the negative in every manifes-
tation of life because it represents the Fatherhood principle
inherent in life. Where the negative principle of mind over-
comes the positive we find sin, sorrow, sickness and distress.
Super Mind Science teaches the Christ way of mastering these
negative conditions of mind; in it the student is taught to mani-
fest his positive Will, united with the Will of God, against all
disease, sin and sorrow. This Will of God or the Father, as
Jesus called it, controls vital energies in the body. These ener-
gies are also positive and negative; no pain can exist where they
fl.ow freely and no sorrow can exist where one has control of
them, for they are the basic principle of existence. Each and
every Super Mind Scientist can control them at Will and can
heal others as well as themselves. This power is the power
demonstrated by Jesus, and to which H e referred when H e
said (Mark 16; verse 17-18) "And these signs shall follow them
that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall
speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if
they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall
lay hands on the sick and they shall recover".
Alleviation When one controls the positive and negative
of life energies, these seeming miracles hecome
Pains easy to perform. In Super Mind Science
these wonders take place daily, the blind receive their sight, the
deaf hear and the lame walk, which is proof that we believe in
Jesus; for if we fail to do these things we become as "empty
6 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
brass and tinkling cymbal". Prayer and belief alone cannot do
these wonders; only a scientific knowledge of the life energies
in the body, and a knowledge of the various states of mind and
man's relation to the Divine Mind can accomplish these won-
ders. Jesus was the greatest of Mind Scientists and He com-
manded His disciples to do His Works.
Every thought, no matter how secret, is
known to Divine Mind and weaves the dra-
Manifestation
pery which clothes our spiritual self. In
Thought
Super Mind Science we regulate the entry and manifestation
of thoughts by controlling the thought center in the Solar
Plexus, thus excluding the low negative thoughts and developing
only the positive thoughts. This brings us in contact with
Divine Mind which is All Good, Truth, Love and Light.
Fourth Prayer is thought, and the result of prayer
Dimensional is the product of mind co~centration - for
Law does God have to informed or does He
know your wants before you ask them? Thought sent out in
earnest prayer sets in motion life currents and energies which
control conditions and bring forth results. Direct concentration
is far better than negative prayers, for in concentration we
suspend thinking except on one subject, then by controlling the
life currents in a positive state of mind, our thought travels in
wave·s through the fourth dimension bringing us the results of
our thought. Super Mind Scientists soon become master of this
art. Do not praise God, for He needs no priase, but concentrate
your mind on good, knowing that "I and my Father are One",
and great powers will come to aid you in conquering the battle
of life.
Spiritual
Goodness alone demonstrates the power of
Truth, which is God. Love is the golden
Regeneration
key to Divine Universal Mind; it sets in
motion the regenerative power of God. "Love Ye One An-
other" is the Divine command, love means to regard your
fellow-man with tolerance, kindness and brotherly feeling. This
is one of the greatest manifestations of Divine Mind, which is
All-Good, Life, Truth and Love.
Reciprocation
of
Good
The fount of creation is the ever present
Divine Mind; you need but to accept its
power. As it pours forth its beneficient
DIVINE MIND 7
energies, man is uplifted toward the supreme light and wisdom!
Contact this Divine Mind with understanding, and darkness be-
comes light, sickness becomes health and man is lifted to a plane
of mastery, revealing his Divine Sonship of God.
Indulgence All weakness of the flesh originates in the
of sin of the carnal mind, it is not inflicted by
Weakness God, for can God and power bring forth
disease? No, only the opposite which is ignorance and negative
thoughts produces these manifestations. The cause lies in carnal
mind with all its selfishness and arrogance; the effect only is in the
' body, so why doctor the effect and ignore the cause which is a
negative mind? Super Mind Science gives to the sincere student
the keys which open the secret doors of life, the energy centers,
making one positive and mentally powerful. Thus man can reflect
the Divine Being, for unless he is master of matter he fails to re-
flect the image and likeness of God. This can be accomplished by
concentration of energy, thought and desire. When one can per-
form this, they can stop pain instantly, heal any disease in their
body, control their mind, and contact Divine Mind at will. All
Super Mind Scientists who study the keys to the Science by sin-
cere application can perform these things, if they say they cannot,
they art not true followers of the Science, or they lack in their
knowledge of its principles and powers.
Self
Dependence
If we ar.e grateful in our minds for the past
blessings we have received, then we will
silently concentrate on God and Good, and
ever be ready to help others, even as God would ever be ready
to help us, remembering that evil is negation, the absence of
good, and not a power. If we are truly grateful to God we
will do good and not continually thank God for blessings re-
ceived. We will realize that only doing good deeds can save
our soul and bring about immortality. Impress upon your mind
by concentration the vision of the Master as H e healed the
sick and preached the Truth even in the face of physical death,
then emulate Him in the chambers of your mind. Do not be
a hypocrite who says that he is saved by believing, and yet
refuses to do the Divine Works of the Great Master, for such
hypocrites are the cµrse of the world!
8 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Inexorable
Laws
The cries of those deceived by false doc-
trines are the fires in the mental torment
which will plague their deceivers. Inner
fervent desire to contact God face to face brings one in rapport
with Divine Mind, but only a knowledge of the Science of
Mind will bring practical results. Super Mind Science supplants
faith with techniques and correct methods to control the powers
.producing life. First, one masters the positive and negative states
and energies, then Solar Energy imbued with Infinite Spirit which
flows through our bodies and brain. When these powers are
controlled by the Will to overcome disease, they become the
power and Will of God, overcoming all bodily congestion and
making the mind positive and free.
"Know the Truth, and the Truth shall make
Mind
you free" is the promise given to every
Indestructible
seeker who enters Super Mind Science. Not
one enters who can say they failed if they are sincere, for these
energies are the life and the light of the world. The intelli-
gence of Divine Mind functions within these energies, and where
they flow freely pain is impossible, for would Godly energy and
power create pain, or would Infinite Mind fail to heal the sick,
or can man devise a plan of healing and helping which would
be superior to the one originated by Almighty God whose fixed
laws in Nature bring forth all creation? Divine Mind alone
provides the universal remedy and cures all ills, and brings man
in contact with God. Jesus called it the "Will of Him who
sent Him into this world". Many Christians try to save their
soul but neglect their body and mind, thinking that the hospital
is superior to God's laboratory of Nature. They cannot see
that their soul is in the body and that the body is the "Temple
of the living God". Would God save one's soul who mistrusts
Him in saving and healing the body, or would God acknowledge
one who denies the very importance of the body, which is His
Holy Temple?
Matter
Sanctified
People who say matter does not exist, fail
to know that matter is energy, a moving
force, that it is a manifestation of mind and
is itself a Divine creation, sanctified by the presence of Divine
Mind within it. Mind is powerless to create without energy
and matter as an instrument, even as matter is powerless to
-
......
DIVINE MIND 9
create its kind without Divine Mind. No one can cease sm
without understanding mind control, for sin is a mental violation
of the laws of Nature. The physical aspect of sin is not the
entire sin, the mental purpose back of it constitutes the real sin,
for mind will never forget; and man must answer for deeds
done while in the body. Sin is destroyed when knowledge
of Divine Mind begins. Negative influences cannot control one
who is positive no more than darkness can control the light.
No one who is positive mentally will continue to sin, for he
will be about His Father's business.
Impunity Positiveness creates, while negation destroys.
From Super Mind Science makes all who apply
Temptation its methods positive. This develops con-
structive mental principles and does away with doubts, beliefs,
dis-beliefs and ignorance and causes the mind to be illuminated,
casting out its effulgent rays on the problems of life. This
wisdom is contained in the keys to Super Mind Science; it
demonstrates Truth, Love and Light through positive mental
control and understanding of Divine Mind. Temptation is of
the negative state of mind, not the positive; one who can con-
trol himself will not be receptive to negative and low tempta-
tions. When one contacts Divine Mind they become immune
to sin and temptation because these low manifestations of carnal
mind are the lack of this positive state and Divine contact.
Destruction God is Love, then to be Godly we must love
of one another. Sectarianism divides people,
Evil whereas the science of Divine Mind unites
them. You cannot place old wine (Sectarianism) in new bottles
(Mental Science) for they (beliefs) will expand and break,
"seek ye therefore the kingdom of God (good) and all things
shall be added unto you"- Prosperity, Health, Power, Truth,
Light and Love, providing you know how to concentrate your
mind on good. Generate the positive healing energies and
direct them against disease, and destroy evil (disease) , for all
disease is the adversary of good. Can .God be creator of pain,
or would God punish innocent babes? No, only sin of carna.l
mind, void of understanding could cause pain and sorrow to
manifest. If your soul is saved, then your body is healthy and
your mind is free from malice, hatred and envy, otherwise you
are lost in illusion believing that God wills you to be sick.
10 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
There can be no evil in Divine Will no more than sunshine
can be in darkness, nor can there be weakness or disease in a
body full of life energy, for pain is contraction and ease is
expansion. Evil is mental congestion of a negative type and
when positiveness of thought is manifest, it ceases to be, for
the mind cannot manifest both light and darkness at the same
moment-only one of the two is possible at the same instant.
Inalienable The scientific explanation of mind is, first,
Science and Divine Mind is positive, creative, construc-
Truth tive; second, carnal mind is mind misused,
negative, destructive, changeable and illusive. The flesh is neg-
ative, a low manifestation of mind; spirit, soul and ego are a
manifestation of higher mind. "Super Mind" is the higher,
All-knowing or the true mind, knowing all Truth. "Science"
is the methods of demonstrating this higher and. more perfect
Truth, Love and Light. Unhappiness is the result of carnal
mind deceiving the individual; happiness is the result of the
individual knowing immortal mind and its powers, or the Su-
preme Divine Infinite Spiritual Mind of the universe which
knows no failures. When one attains to Truth, sin, sickness
and mortal illusion disappear into nothingness, pain ceases
and sorrow ends. God and misery do not agree; where one is
the other is not, for God is Love, and disease is sin. As soon
as one principle controls, the other is controlled; if sin and
disease control then God is not manifesting, for will God sub-
mit to being controlled by evil, or can God be overcome by
the adversary? The so-called devil has no power when God
speaks through the Sonship of man, his greatest creation, when
man is positive and possesses wisdom.
Omnipotent
Will Energy
Super Mind Science demonstrates first, the
control of life energy, next the power of
mind control, and third, the Divine Spiritual
Will which, united with individual Will overcomes all conges-
tion. This .unity of Will demonstrates over all negation. Human
theories of this Will matter very little, for only demonstrations
are a reality, therefore we seek to prove all things and hold fast
to that which is good. Human senses and carnal mind, with-
out the sustaining power of a spiritualized Will, are inadequate
in solving life's mysteries. This spiritualized Will power alone
.::
DIVINE MIND 11
can give man spiritual realization, it is contacted by concentra-
tion and meditation, not by belief.
Proof The desire for wisdom is man's greatest
of means of soul progression and Divine Mind
Divinity performs wonders through the Will of man
and the laws of Nature. Supernaturalism belongs to an age
of superstition and has no place in Divine Mind Science, for
since we know how to control physical and mental energies,
we can account for all phenomena. The mind governs the
body, this is proven every time one thinks preceding a move
of the body. This same energy which moves the limbs, when
concentrated, removes disease, then Divine Mind seals the case,
making it permanent. The author has proven that Super Mind
Science has the one and only key known to man today which
controls this energy and has demonstrated on many disbelievers
successfully when all else had failed.
Subjugation Super Mind Science heals one disease as
of easy as another, for all disease is congestion,
Disease while energy is expansion; the energy which
heals comes from the sun, while the power which causes the
healing is of God or Supreme Infinite Mind. The physical is
but an extension of the Divine and one is as real as the other.
All powers are subservient to man when he learns i:he Truth,
the Light and the Way. The blind have received their sight
in Super Mind Science, as has the ·Author who was at one time
blind; the deaf hear, and the lame walk. Students successfully
heal their own families, and Physicians use it in their office with
great success, because it is not a belief, but is a science. The
proof of Mind Science is when it heals unbelievers, for Jesus
often healed those whom He saw for the first time. Other
so-called meta-physical healing systems using hypnosis and call-
ing it Divine Mind Science have failed to meet this test. Sug-
gestions or affirmations are the first step toward self hypnosis-
these practices are used in many systems of healing today.
Super Mind Science is opposite to these negative systems, for
every Super Mind Scientist can heal and stop pain instantly
without the use of any belief, whereas these other systems have
Healers and Practitioners to heal their own members-if they
are Divine in all their practices, then why do they require a
Healer-why are they not their own H ealer?
12 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Mental
Negation
Only a negative sick person needs a Prac-
titioner or Healer. In some of these healing
methods one will notice that passes are
usually made over the patient's face, these passes are the same
used by hypnotists, they spread magnetism over the patient,
then make them believe the pain is gone. The treatment lasts
as long as the delusion remains; it is no wonder that their mem-
bers are sick and need to be healed. In Super Mind Science,
each student can heal and stop pain, and demonstrates in the
Classes and Church the doctrine "they shall lay hands on
the sick, and the sick shall recover". Many who have used
suggestions, have become poverty stricken and cannot manage
their own affairs, and it is not to be wondered at, since every
suggestion used weakens the body and makes the person more
susceptible to disease and poverty.
Superposition Super Mind Science is a positive science, it
of teaches how to use the united Will of ·man
Mind Science and God, demonstrating "I and My Father
are One". Its principles will sometime in the future become
the leading healing Science of the world. Many patients think
they are healed in negative metaphysics, but in reality Nature
has healed them while suggestions had them deluded into be-
lieving dis~ase does not exist. If the premise that disease has
no existence is true, then why do the negative Metaphysical
Schools have Healers and Practitioners to heal disease? Also,
if matter is a non-reality, then one asks, how could you heal it?
Their form of reasoning is as defective as their understanding,
for they say, "if God is real, then matter is illusion, if it is
illusion, it does not exist". The abstract can never prove or
dis-prove the concrete, the truth is that God is in matter and
also in mind, only ignorance of the power of God, such as
affirmations and auto-suggestions used over the mental faculties
produce illusion. For instance, a suggestion that you cannot
hear will cause deafness and a suggestion that your body does
not exist will cause death of the body. No one is permitted
by the laws of mind to mock God and His Divine laws of
Nature, for no one can be wiser than their Creator.
Mental
Illumination
All evidence at hand proves that God cre-
ated the material universe through the laws
of positive and negative vibration. The
positive is the leading power and the first to be applied in bring-
DIVINE MIND
ing about a creation, the receptive or negative is the germinating
power; both forces are necessary for a creation. Super Mind
Science teaches the means and proper way to control the posititve
and negative powers of the body, mind and soul. These laws
were revealed to the Founder while suffering with a terrible
disease, and the reader may be assured that none of the knowl-
edge was received from mortal mind, but was communicated
to the writer through the voice of cosmic mind, while he was
in the Spirit, or absent from the body. Some of the world's
greatest revelations have come while the revelator was suffering.
Super Mind Science was revealed so as to furnish the individual
with a Science which would be a surcease for pain, also methods
to overcome the evil and negative tendency of carnal mind,
bringing about a spiritual state of mind.
Light When Truth, Love and Light predominate
and in one's life, they will succeed, and they will
Power know something of these laws regardless of
whether they become a Super Mind Scientist or not. All intel-
ligence is the result of mind action and power. The physical
is only an instrument played by the master musicain (mind), it
responds to the planes of vibration of the consciousness of the
individual. Positive, Divine mental activity brings about ease,
prosperity and happiness. All other opposite conditions such
as disease, sin, sorrow, failure and unhappiness are produced as
a result of the negative force ruling.
Divine
Harmony
"Know the Truth and the Truth shall make
Ye free"-the Truth makes one free only
when the power which demonstrates mental
freedom is revealed. Super Mind Science demonstrates all posi-
tive powers and teaches that all Truth is three-fold, Physical,
Mental and Spiritual. In Super Mind Science one finds the
following rules in all demonstrations, first, physical energy is in-
creased; second, energy is directed by Will and concentration
toward mastery of any condition- physical, mental or spiritual;
third, Divine Mind is controlled within, which is the source of
all health, happiness and power; this seals all demonstrations
with permanent results. Other and more negative teachings
operate on one plane only, this makes it impossible to consider
them a Science, for Science demonstrates each and every time,
while methods only physical, only mental or only spiritual are
14 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
inadequate to reach most of one's troubles. There are many
temporary relief cases and seeming healings through these in-
complete systems, because all negative patients secure temporary
relief, but in Super Mind Science the cause of disease, which
is congestion, is permanently overcome. The keys to this power
which are the increasing of physical and mental energy and
Divine power must be given by a competent teacher who has
observed the methods discovered by the Founder and is duly
authorized to teach the same.
Mental
Reasoning
Super Mind Science methods are directly
opposite in principle to the negative suggest-
ive methods usually used in mental healing.
Each and every method is based on the immutable laws of
Nature and makes the student stronger mentally, physically and
spiritually. The. following questions ars asked by a Super Mind
Scientist in order that you may use your reasoning power:
1st. Can light overcome darkness?
2nd. Is it natural that darkness dispels light?
3rd. Is disease (congestion) more powerful than God and
energy, or can it overcome the one who uses these powers?
4th. Is it natural that energy and God be overpowered by
negation, disease, sin a11d failure?
5th. Can a method perfect and positive within itself fail to
help one and yet control energy and Divine power?
If these powers should fail, God would be a failure, conse-
quently all life would be in danger of complete extinction.
These pillars of Truth support Super Mind Science and cannot
be ·disproven by any type of Science, nor can the demonstrations
be equalled in any Religion, Science or Belief. Super Mind
Science is the greatest Physician, T eacher and Philosopher and
interprets the Bible scientifically. Its wisdom is as perfect as
Infinite Spirit, and was revealed to the Founder while suffering
and concentrating on Infinite Spirit for a revelation, as taught by
the Eastern Saints in the fastness of the Himalaya Mountains
where the Prophets of India wrote the Vedas, man's first Divine
revelation of Truth and power.
CHAPTER II
SUPPLICATION
"]esus answered, and said unto them, 'Verily I
say unto you, if Ye have faith and doubt not,
Ye shall not only do this which is done unto the
fig tree, but also if Ye shall sa31 unto this moun-
tain, be Thou removed and be Thou cast into
the sea, it shall be done."
Saying
Prayers
The true supplication which regenerates the
sinner, also heals the sick, for it is the inner
consciousness of the absolute power of God.
This consciousness is developed through an inner understanding
of God, as spiritual principle beyond personality and limitation.
Omnipotent and Omniscient beyond cognition of mortal mind.
This intelligence manifests through spiritual energy and power,
it heals the sick and brings ease to the mind. Intense prayer
is intense mental concentration which accounts for the results
obtained by praying to the Deity. One must approach in the
spirit of self immolation through meekness of mind, seeking a
spiritualization of their life and consciousness, in order to benefit
by earnest prayer and desire.
Silent
Desires
Our silent desires of the heart set in motion
energies and powers which bring them into
reality if we trust God and have a worthy
desire. The All-seeing Divine Mind has so constituted the
powers of life that every just desire produces its own reward.
A true prayer is a constant silent desire with an unselfish motive.
In order that our desire be unselfish we must have perfect mind
control, for carnal mind manifests strongest in the consciousness
of one whose lower nature is uncontrolled. Super Mind Sci-
ence teaches the proper way to attain this desired mind control,
for it teaches the genders of mind. Low desires are but negative
thoughts, while positive thoughts develop high exalted desires,
prayer based upon a desire created from a positive thought
brings forth its own answer. Justice, Love, Light and Truth
are positive principles and prayers should be in harmony with
these spiritual ideals.
16 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
God Prayers of weakness from the mentality of
1s an admitted sinner are a poor remedy for
Power one's ills, for God being of positive, Divine
principles does not harmonize with such prayers; weakness must
be overcome, not tolerated and encouraged. God is Good and
all prayer should conform to His Infinite Goodness. The one
offering the supplication should remember also that God is a
Creator, not a destroyer, th_
erefore all prayers should be of a
creative nature. Those w):io request God to save them should
attempt first to save themselves, letting goodness overpower all
evil in their life. Positive action of the mind regenerates man;
negation, suggestions and affirmations break down the positive
mental structure, therefore it is very important that the Will to
do good be controlled in the silent supplication to God.
God The Supreme Infinite Mind whom we call
Is God is universal in mamfestation, His divine
Universal laws, like His Being, are also universal, not
individual. God does not conform to the boundaries and limi-
tations of creeds and dogmas, the laws of Nature do not work
by the permission of any certain religious creed, nor can any
stay the hand of death when one has used up all their energy
or violated Nature's immutable laws. However, man can change
his destiny by a study of natural laws-for Nature is one with
and manifests through Divine power.
Erroneous
Pleas
Pleas for power are unnecessary until we
use the power at hand; Jesus said "the king-
dom of heaven is at hand". Sincere, un-
spoken, Divine communion arouses this power to action, and God
functioning through mind produces the results. Those negative
mortals who ask God to change the laws of Nature will find
that God does not violate His own immutable laws. The safest
truth to depend on is "when mind concentrates, God operates",
for every true power which is good for man is useless until it
is concentrated. No power while scattered abroad in the uni-
verse takes definite effect on other powers, only when it is con-
centrated does.it produce effect.
Spiritual
Accuracy
The laws of God and Nature work in per-
fect harmony, there can be no separation
between these powers if success is achieved.
The union and perfect harmony of mind and Nature's immut-
able laws is necessary in every prayer if one would seek a
SUPPLICATION 17
demonstration of perfect results. The prayers of Jesus were
answered immediately because He was in tune with the Infinite;
His Will and the Will of the Father were one. In order that
this co-ordination of man and G"1CI be established, each individ-
ual should work out their own salvation. Man must not sit
idle and pray that God do his work for him, he must ever be
alert and willing to do his own part. Spiritual illuminatiqn
develops from one using their faculties as they should and from
an intense desire to know God.
Theory Many admit in theory that God is All-
' and powerful, but deny it in practice; when they
Ignorance are sick they seek drugs or other material
remedies, yet theoretically they claim to believe that God is
All-powerful. When all material remedies have failed which
they usually place before God, then they begin fervent prayers
for Divine aid. If God can aid them, then why wait until all
man-made remedies have been tried in vain? Such theoretical
religious ideas may serve as a moral restraint but their spiritual
value is indeed small. Vain repetitions of belief do not sway
God from Justice, Love, Mercy or Truth, they only serve as a
power to delude those who are so negative mentally as to use
them. The more ungrateful one is for Truth, Light and Love,
the mwe they will be punished by the Law of Compensation
and will suffer until they learn that "God is not to be mocked".
Selfish
Pride
Those who exhibit their selfishness by say-
ing long prayers to be seen of men, would
do better to remain silent, for they set in
motion forces which destroy them or which later may be the
cause of their undoing. Every one should remember to do
Divine works and thereby glorify their Father in heaven. Di-
vine Mind knows every deed which we commit while in the
body, therefore there is no secret; let everyone be conscious of
the All-seeing eye of Spirit.
Divine
Petitions
Constant pet1t10ns to God for help are un-
necessary if man is doing his part. When
one becomes spiritually illuminated their life
will be well ordered; the fact that a life is always in difficulty,
proves the lack of spiritual power in that life. Each good deed
assists the spiritual energy to flow into our life, bringing us
countless blessings and the desire to do more good. Health and
18 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
happiness are natural attributes of a spiritual life. We should
serve God in our fellowman as well as in the universe. Jesus
commanded those who love Him to do His works; if belief and
affirmations were all that is n~essary to save a soul, would He
have taught other than that to His disciples? Seek therefore
to emulate Him by doing the works which He did.
Engrave the image of Christ in your heart,
Christ's
Im picture in your mind how He healed the
age sick, walked on the water, overcame death
and taught the Truth in the face of physical death. Then go
on to accomplish His message, knowing God is Good but is no
respector of personalities or beliefs. Our Goodness or Godliness
equals our mind control, therefore the Science of Christ is the
Science of Mind. When one utters a silent prayer they should
also silently take inventory of their own mentality and soul,
seeing to what degree they merit reward.
Sup Learn to go inward to the very heart of
with your being and close out all the manifesta-
Him tions of earth, and sup with Christ. H e
awaits you in the silence of your own heart and soul, forget
the world and focus your mind on His Infinite Power within.
In the Divine recesses of your being, there exists Truth, Love
and Divine Consciousness, seek to know this through intense
devotion to Him, to His cause and to His purpose on earth.
Learn to heal the sick, speak the Truth and do the Divine Works,
then He will come into your being and sup with you. We meet
Him on the plane of Infinite, impersonal love when we learn
to know God and Christ as one supreme power, manifesting
the human and Divine in one. You may be persecuted by the
worldly, but bear your cross and let your road in life be one
of gladness and not one of sadness, retain a constant prayer
of devotion to good.
Mortal
Devotion
'The outward mortal devotion, consisting of
long prayers and fo~al ceremonies is far
removed from Him "who seeth in secret and
rewardeth openly". They deceive the poor deluded mortals who
are unfortunate enough to believe them, but they are powerless
before the Throne of Grace. Only the silent prayers, clothed
in good intentions given from the heart are recognized by
Divine Mind. These prayers enable one to follow in the foot-
steps of Christ, while audible prayers, ceremonies and beliefs
SUPPLICATION 19
of mortal man cause one to tarry on the road of life. They
cover hidden animal emotions with respectability and are the
producers of hypocrisy.
Spiritual
Truth
True regeneration comes from a renewing
of the mind, not from matter; this reforms
the character and develops the inner percep-
tion of God. A constant cognition of God constitutes true
conversion, while outward formal conversion is far from reality.
One should remember "as Ye sow, so shall Ye reap" and con-
version does not change that law. The most conversion does
is to renew the mind and change one's mental outlook on life,
for God is no respector of personalities or ceremonies. Sowing
spiritual seeds is the doing of good deeds, for "good seeds
bringeth forth good fruit, while corrupt seeds bringeth forth
corrupt fruit".
Man's
Influence
God continually influences matter, but mat-
ter cannot and does not influence God. The
realization of this Godly influence brings
man in harmony with Divine Love, his unawareness of it causes
most of his troubles in life. Realization of the power of this
influence over one's life is mental, not physical, therefore Men-
tal Science comprehends it far better than formal theoretical
religion. Every good deed is either compensated in this world
or the next, no good goes unrewarded and no evil goes unpun-
ished; the idea of one escaping just punishment through prayer
would make God a partner of evil and crime. God is Love,
therefore only prayers of love and power are answered, for
who could induce a just God to be unjust, or a loving Father
to do evil to His child? Carnal mind with all of its excuses has
no power in the presence of one single ray of the Supreme
Infinite Spirit, God.
Evil Good deeds destroy sin and make one's
Overcome being the true "~emple of the living God".
By Good Evil is non-existent when good manifests,
therefore it is not a power, but is mere negation. When one
begins to know Truth, Love and Light their consciousness be-
comes spiritually illuminated and they lose interest in sin and
worldly pleasures. One who asks God to forgive their sins and
then goes on sinning does not deserve forgiveness. A constant
inner communion with God destroys sin and disease for these
negative conditions are the absence of good and cannot exist in
20 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
the presence of one single ray of God. The Science of Mind
teaches' one how to become positive and thereby destroy sin,
disease and finally overcome death, and we should always be
thankful for it.
Sin
Forgiveness
When one commits sin the conscience reg-
isters guilt regardless of how many prayers
one says, and the guilt will remain as long
as the conscience registers remorse for the deed. The theologi-
cal myth that man can forgive sin is contrary to reason, for
matter cannot dictate to Spirit, nor can man rule, direct or advise
God. If man with his poor judgment was given the power to
remove' guilt and to forgive sin, there would be a complete re-
:versal of justice. Earthly hierarchies of political minded men
ma:y be a moral force but they have no spiritual power. They
may write .prayer books, but God has written all true prayer
in the sincerity of purpose in the hearts of men. Earnest sup-
plication expresses the love God has concealed in the heart,
it is far superior to mortal man's repetition of unreasonable
Pater Nosters. What the world needs is mind control in order
to understand the nature of God.
The taking of human life is an unpardonable
Unpardonable
sin, and there can be no forgiveness later.
Sin
Jesus said "he who lives by the sword, shall
die by the sword'', meaning a spiritual death. It matters little
what excuse man has for shedding blood, he may call it capital
punishment, war or self-defense which are only mortal terms.
So-called Christians who endorse the killing of their fellow-man
are poor examples of the Christ principle.
Other
Sin
The other sin which most people overlook
is the wholesale killing of animals for food.
This type of food brings disease and death
to those who eat it, for no one can kill God's creatures without
the laws of life sentencing them to an early death. Super Mind
Science deplores the killing of any of God's creatures and
teaches its followers to be vegetarians, for man can live a
healthier and cleaner life through abstaining from eating flesh.
Prayers are useless as long as man disobeys the commandment
"Thou shalt not kill". This commandment is a law forbidding
the killing of every living creature, murder is only one aspect
of its meaning. Jesus said "fear not those who would kill your
SUPPLICATION 21
body, but fear those who would kill you unto the second death",
for the freedom of the conscience is the life of the soul.
God God is Truth, Love and Life, therefore a
Is prayer that He give these qualities is a fqol-
Love ish request, for how can He give other than
Love and Truth? "As Ye sow, so shall Ye reap", whatsoever
man merits he will receive, for "a good tree bringeth forth
good fruit". Those who think God is unjust are thinking about
God the way their own soul judges them, if they were just,
they would see that God is just. Arrogance is related to conceit,
while humility is a virtue related to Love. One should learn to
be master and overcome disease and sin, and not continually
seek pardon.
Sickness Sin is a violation of the laws of Nature and
Is a producer of disease. Jesus said to the sick
Sin "go and sin no more", knowing that if they
obeyed Him they would be healthy and happy in the future.
No one should expect God to stay the hand of Nature,. for God
is the author of natural laws, and no laws have been written by
mortal man which are as complete as the laws of Nature. If
one adopts the policy of non-participation in killing of any kind,
their ·prayers will be more e:ffective, for will God forgive one
whose habit is to destroy life, or will He lengthen a life which
is undeserving of His notice? One should study Nature and
harmonize with th~ principles of Truth, Love and Light in every
venture of life.
Emotional
Prayers
Emotional prayers are like emotional conver-
sion, they produce physical sensation and
mental hallucinations. They do not impress
God and their answer is temporary like their quality. Emotions
are of the lower planes of matter, therefore emotional prayers
are of a low order, and usually embody a selfish plea that God
do something which would be unlike His divine, eternal prin-
ciple. Prayers of the opposite type carry with them an uplifting
appeal and therefore produce results. One must learn to say
to the Tempter, "get thee behind me, Satan". Evil thoughts,
vyhich are the angels of Satan (adversary) must be overcome,
then only correct prayers will be uttered.
Divine
Consolation
When one becomes a habitual sinner, asking
forgiveness through prayer while not yet
overcoming sin, they soon develop into
...
22 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
hypocrites. They are theoretical Christians but deny the prac·
ticality of Christ's teachings, they think that the entire human
family is as lacking in courage as they are and they use Divine
consolation as an aid to sin. How ungodly this practice is, for
would God who is all Love be a party to their willful sins?
Pureness of heart is the greatest virtue of man, next to
that is honesty and sincerity of purpose. Many prayers are
already answered before the mind of the supplicant gives them
formation, for Divine Mind is All-knowing, therefore cognizant
of all good. On the plane of Divinity, neither tenses or time
exist, as the fourth dimension is immeasurable by mortal man,
because it is God's domain. All temporal things are subject to
decay and change because they exist only within the confines
of the three dimensions- space, place and time. Earnest prayer
manifested through a constant desire in the heart is fourth
dimensional while selfish prayers are of the three dimensional
world, this being the cause of them going unanswered. There-
fore purge your consciousness of selfishness and do not utter
selfish prayers, for God seeth in secret and knows your every
purpose. Do not be deceived by thinking you can possess a
secret, for all mind is Infinite Spirit; mind is not corporeal,
therefore is spiritual. One must learn that God is in mind and
must cease thinking of a material heaven.
Self
Justification
Self justification constitutes one of the most
common of mortal errors, for one is prone
to criticise others and overlook their own
shortcomings. They should "find · the beam in their own eye
before searching for the mote in another's eye". Inner prayer
for wisdom will bring forth meekness, for arrogance is in itself
ignorance and sin. Weakness of character is the result of sordid
negative thinking on the part of man. Man should develop
character by exercising his mind in the right direction, rather
than trying to attain it through requesting God to make the
changes for him. A prayer which pictures the lowness of one's
character and acknowledges mental negation will do more harm
than good, for one should express the unselfishness and perfec-
tion of God in all prayers.
Lofty
Prayer
Lofty praying is useless unless a lofty effort
is put forward, for we are compensated for
our deeds and not for our opinions. If be-
lief could build character, then the entire world would be filled
SUPPLICATION 23
with wonderful people. When one can see the guidance of the
Unseen Hand in Nature and in all life, they will know the
Nature of God, this, however, requires study and inner under-
standing, which is a quality of the soul.
Honest endeavor is always rewarded, whereas many peti-
tions go unrewarded. The overcoming of selfishness is a spiri-
tual necessity, whereas the ideas of personality over Spirit pro-
duce iµharmony in our being. Unless the overcoming methods
are applied to master this mortal condition of mind, lofty pray-
ing will be useless, for will God help those who refuse to help
themselves? When one's being is attuned with the Infinite, this
philosophy will be found to be the greatest light on the Path
of Life. One becomes grateful for Truth through suffering;
materiality is the cause of suffering while its remedy lies in true
spirituality. To follow in the footsteps of Jesus is one thing,
while asserting you believe in Him is quite another. Cruci-
fixion comes to tl}e flesh ideas in one's life if they persistently
follow Him.
Inner
Introspection
Inner contemplation where one takes stock
of their own mental condition is the golden
key to Divine realization, for God is in the
center of our being. If our introspection is for the purpose of
self enlightenment, it is Godly, for while in this state of con-
sciousness one may send forth intense prayer and contact the
God-head in the universe. However, if the motive is selfish the
contact will not be made, but if it is right, one will find that
this contact is the contact Jesus spoke of when He said, "I and
My Father are One". It seals all vows and sets free a captive
and deluded soul whose imprisonment in the body of matter
confines it to the realm of the shadows of life. This ·at-one-
ment is supreme peace manifest, and everyone -
should seek it
that they may come to know the nature of Divine Mind. The
Over-soul beckons to those who desire to overcome the sorrow
of the physical world to come into Divine realization of Truth,
Love and Light.
Highest
Truth
The highest understanding comes from di-
rect contact with the Infinite, not from a
belief in vicarious atonement. Jesus taught
that the door to life was "straight and narrow, and few there
be who enter therein", while the creeds teach an entirely oppo-
site doctrine. They teach and quote the Disciple, John, who
24 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
says "for God so loved the world that He gave. His only begot•
ten Sqn, that all who believe in Him may have eternal life".
Which is better, that we follow the Master or should we follow
the Disciple? In this case you cannot follow both, for one
teaches that few attain to life, .while the other says that all who
believe in Christ shall attain to life eternal. The condition of
attaining rest and peace, in the'teaching of Christ Jesus is "I am
the Way and the Life, come unto Me all Ye that are weary and
I will give you rest". The "coming" is mental, for we ~annot
go unto Him physically, the "'rest" is a mental state of mental
peace, therefore we must seek mentally in deep contemplation
to see God within, overcome all disturbing material desires and
God will be revealed within tlie. center of our being.
Altar Each seeker for Truth should :find an altar
of of sacrifice within to be used when.the mind
Sacrifice desires to sin, mentally placing the desire
on this altar, realizing that God is AU in All, remembering the
old commandment "Thou shalt have no other Gods before me".
The giving up of a sinful desire should be accompanied by
action of the will and concentration of the mind to overcome it,
rather than with long emotional prayers. Jesus said "if thy
right hand offend thee, cut it off", meaning if you are tempted
by relative or friend to do sinful deeds, sever the friendship;
inner prayer will give one the mental power to accomplish this.
Mental Science gives one strength of character and the power
of resistance. Christianity is a science, not a belief, therefore
one needs to study the. mental aspect of self control and mental
discipline to become a Christian.
Walking When we walk in the Path of Light we
in the learn to extend a helping hand to our fel·
Light lowman, for the healing of the sick and the
doing of good deeds are the brightest pictures which will remain
in memory. We must learn to give physically, mentally and
spiritually for, "Give Ye and Ye shall receive". The law of
giving is one of the greatest aids to prosperity. Many fail to
receive in life because they pray for more favors from God,
yet they are too selfish to give. Materialism is the basis of
most of human misery, while spirituality is an aid to success
and happiness. Mental suggestion of success creates a delusion
and fails to prodU;ce because it is negative, therefore not crea· ,
tive; only positive mental effort is truly productive of results.

Negative affirmations of belief or disbelief break down the men-
tal structure. God is not to blame for one's failures, they are
the result of one. violating the immutable laws of mind, for
mind being master of matter one must obey its laws. An
understanding of the laws of gender of the mind reveals the true
source of man's creative ability and the power within or his,
·~sons.hip of God".
Punishment If sins were ,to go unpunished, the upward
for trend of human ·progress would soon stop,
Transgression for only the consciousness that every sin
shall cause punishment is the incentive for one to become better.
A constant remission of sins on the part of God or Christ would
encourage violation of the Divine laws and Commandments,
therefore one should pray for power to master themselves and
overcome the desire for sinning, rather than for forgiveness.
Restitution is more important than confession of sins because it
frees the consciousness from self condemnation. Everyone
should strive to know· God as Absolute Good. The reward for
prayers equal their ·mental value, the emotional desire of the
supplicant is not taken into consideration by the All-seeing Di-
vine Mind of the universe. Prayer only sets in motion Divine
Mind energies, it is not heard by a personality in the sky as
some carnal minded people believe.
Reward The reward for sincere petitions is always
for measured by the pureness of heart of the
Petitions supplicant, it never exceeds their own good-
ness. The concept that God aids evil or those with evil inten-
tions is erroneous. A constant effort to develop spirituality
will make prayers more effective and give one peace of mind;
to attain mental bliss, unselfishness is a necessary quality. The
farther away one draws their consciousness from matter, giving
up material aims and desires the closer it approaches God, for
·materialism is the power behind the throne in the world of sin
and strife.
.Silent prayer is the prayer of wisdom ex-
pressing silently, its essence is sincerity.
There is no element of conceit or false pride
in silent prayer, however, the prayer when intensified, becomes
positive mental concentration of mind powers. False or selfish
prayers harm the sens1t1veness of conscience while unselfish
prayers draw one close to the Infinite. E;very recess of the
Silent
Prayer
26 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
inner being is illuminated when one expresses unselfish thoughts
or does a good deed. This inner illumination is the at-one-ment
with God to be desired.
Healing
Prayer
The greatest healing prayer is to know that
pure Infinite Spirit is present in every cell
of our being, and that disease cannot e::Gst in
the presence of this Divine power. When one can control all
healing powers as taught in Super Mind Science, disease cannot
be stronger than God, nor can disease overpower the life healing
energy which is directed by the super will force of one who
knows the keys to its control. The good effect of prayer for
the sick is in the fact that the positive energy in the person sick
is aroused into action by the positive thoughts which, are ex-
pressed by the one offering the prayer. Blind faith in God has
some power to relieve disease, but is a negative, unscientific
way of attaining results. The prayer of wisdom was the type
uttered by Jesus. Every disease is the product of sin, either
willful or in the form of ignorance, therefore one must seek to
cast out disease, rather than heal the effect anq let the cause
remain.
Divine
Methods
Jesus had a Divine method of healing disease:
He usually laid His hands on the sick, which
caused a circulation of life energy. After
this application He uttered deep sincere commands to the Divine
powers within to heal the person in accordance with their faith,
which is one's mental concept of healing and of God: it is not
an emotional excited state of consciousness. Those who are
seemingly benefitted by prayers to a personal God are really
benefitted by the power of suggestion to their mortal faculties,
this type of healing is like mortal life, it is temporal and of an
impermanent, transitory nature. Permanent help may be realized
by the concentration of the consciousness in a devoted state on
Infinite Spirit. This is easy to accomplish when one learns the
laws of gender of the mind as taught in Super Mind Science.
Love and power are of a universal nature and are revealed to
those whose concept of life is broad and Universal. God is not
influenced by the boundaries of creed, such limitatfon is physical,
not spirituaL
SUPPLICATION 27
The spiritual concept of life, is the idea of.
~iritual the All-ness of God and the transitory con•
oncept ditions of matter. This consciousness of
spiritual values purifies the mental purpos~s of life and brings
one close to the true reality of God. This realization is beyond
all dogmatic assertion and creedalistic affirmation, it gives one
comfort when in sorrow and heals the body through proper
adjustment of life energies and powers. Mental consciousness of
the Infinite in every cell of the body is the highest typ~ of meta-
physical realization, while a denial of matter is the greatest
mental sin. It ti:angresses the law of God who created
matter as the "Temple of the Living God"; denial of disease is
mental ignorance. The refusal of man to admit his imperfection
does away with opportunity to develop his spiritual faculties
and is not a Christian doctrine. The true source of such teach-
ings is a mis-concept of Buddhaism. Christ taught in His state-
ment of Divine at•one~ment that "I and My Father are One",
which incll,lded His whole being~mind, body and soul. This is
also a metaphysical concept not understood by the materialists.
Infinite
Love
Man transgre~ses the Divine Law and yet
often goes with less punishment than he .
deserves. Infinite Love is me;ciful whereas
carnal mind is sinful, if this were not true man would destroy
himself before he learned the lesson .that "sin never pays". The
consciousness that man is master and not a slave is the true idea
of the spiritual man, not of the carnal minded, willful sinner
who igi:iores God until he is convinced he is about to make the
transition from the visible to the invisible. While in a mental
quandary he prays to a God whom previous to that time he. had
ignored and ~ven detested for "sin hateth the way of righteous-
ness". That which is spiritual is foolish unto the carnal minded
while that which is carnal is foolish to -those who have attained
to the wisdom of Life Divine. The war between i:natter and
Spirit is but the law of gender of the mind misunderstood by
misguided mortals.
Sincere
Desires
Public demonstrations of fervent prayer
seldom convey the sincere desire of an
illumined soul. Usually such prayers are
temporary outbursts of emotion from those who live so negative
28 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
that their consciousness .condemns their deeds. Many times
public prayers are but vain repetitions of words which have
only external meaning, many times they have been learned from
a prayer book who!'e purpose is to instruct those who read
in what to say. Such books are written by mortal man with the
pre.mise in mind that they furnish quick words and formation of
sentences to those who cannot express the convictions of their
heart. These may be termed stereotyped formal prayers without
spiritual realization on the part of the supplicant. Anyone who
uses them trains their mind to be insincere, for all true prayers
are written in the desires of the heart by the All,seeing Divine
Mind. Can man improve on what God has done, or write words
to express spiritual ideas fitting to each individual's spiritual
'
needs? No, only the power of inner perception can reveal the
thoughts needed for such spiritual upliftment. Material beauty
is only an outward manifestation of a more perfect beauty. An
oral prayer is only a crude reflection of .the inner goodness and
power of an inner prayer, uttered by the consciousness of one
who has proved the utter lack of power in matter to give one
health, peace or power. The fragrance of a flower and its beauty
of color has no permanency. The flower is soon wafted away on
the wings of the wind in the form of a powder invisible to mate,
rial sight, the only lasting thing about it is its symbolical meaning,
which is the unfoldment of the powers of the soul. The higher
aspirations of a seeker of light is the greatest promise of good in
this carnal minded world. Mental consciousness of God should
extend into every cell in our body, bringing Infinite Spirit from a
realm of obscurity to a prominent place in our lives, then we·
will really know "Mind over Matter".
It is apparent to every careful observer that
formal rites and· ceremonies are failing as a
Consciousness
remedy for sin and crime, also that they have
Mortal
failed for the last two thbusand years, therefore a spiritualization
of the consciousness of man is the only remedy for the present
ills of life. Inner prayer which contacts God not only gives man
a reassurance of the Divine presence but also heals the sick and
brings spiritual power into manifestation. The prayer which
Jesus prayed is a complete realization of the power of mind as
taught in Super Mind Science. One should say it with the under·
standing that it is the key to mastery or· Lord's Prayer, when
scientifically interpreted. It is an ideal spiritual prayer when
SUPPLICATION 29
Super Mind Science gives its meaning, however, this meaning
is given in all sense of humility and is not intended to be con-
strued as adding to the Lord's Prayer or taking anything away,
it is only a brief analysis of the scientific philosophy it contains.

CHAPTER III
SACRAMENT AND SALVATION
"Enter Ye in at the strait gate: for 'Wide is the
gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to
destruction, and many there be which go in there-
at, because strait is the gate, and narrow is
the way which leadeth unto life, and few there
be that find it"- JESUS.
Attaining immortality does not depend upon
a creed, ritual, or a belief, for only a unity
Consciousness
of man and God can accomplish this. Jesus
Divine
taught conditional immortality, He did not teach that all who
believe in a certain religion would attain to that sublime state
of Divine Consciousness. This Divine state rnust be attained
while one is on earth if they would be one of the few "who
enters the straight gate to life" referred to by Jesus. Regardless
of what one rnay believe, this is the truth about salvation as
taught by Christ Jesus. No man-made ceremony can change the
Divine law which governs soul salvation; no clerical pronounc-
ment can alter the decision of a Just God of Love, Light and
Truth. Jesus taught placing the responsibility on the individual, .
while His disciple, John, taught an opposite doctrine, or accord-
ing to John there is an opposite statement rnade by Jesus concern-
ing salvation, for it is written in John (Chapter 3, verse 16): "For
God so loved the world that He gave His only Begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in Hirn should not perish, but have
everlasting life." This teaching is salVation for the vast multi-
tudes who affirm their belief in Christ, but does not coincide
with the doctrine that "straight is the gate and narrow is the
way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it". The
contrast is between salvation by good deeds, and salvation by
belief alone. Jesus gave a test for those who believed in Hirn,
"the signs which were to follow thern are namely, healing the
sick, casting out demons and raising the dead".
Worldly
Concept
The worldly minded say that belief is
sufficient and that faith will save the soul,
yet we are told in the Scripture that "faith
without works is dead". Are we to continue to accept the empty
SACRAMENT AND .SALVATION 31
belief void of works, which has· failed during the past two thou-
sand years to give humanity health, mind control and peace of
mind? Is it not better that we do the "works" and also possess the
faith? Which is the safest road? One leads to light, health and
happiness through Super Mind Science, the other is the path of
darkness. The :first requirement is a knowledge of the laws of
mind, body and soul, demonstrated by Jesus. These laws are the
genders of the mind which give the key to unlimited mental
powers, and were used by the Master in creating the "food for
the multitudes" and the "walking on water" and "raising from
the dead". They are the positive laws of mental creation oper-
ated by the concentrated will of man and God unlimited, which
also controls the subjective powers of mind as manifest in Nature.
Science The operation of the positive law of mental
of creation which gives man the power to
Mind "overcome the world" is the highest tech-
nique of "The Science of Mind". Through this law man
becomes. one with God and is reconciled to the :first principle of
Life and Truth through the harmonious blending of the
powers of mind. Super Mind Science overcomes matter and
gives the individual a glimpse of the "kingdom of God at hand".
Disease, sorrow and sin are mastered through overcoming their
cause, which is negation of the mind and an uncontrolled physi-
cal nature. Demonstration is the proof of power, and those not
able to demonstrate the Divine powers of the Master have a
poor concept of the reality of God. One will have to answer for
deeds committed while in the body, not for the correctness of
his belief, for reality is recognized by God while speculation is
but a mental shadow. Materialism is the curse of this world
while spirituality is the leaven in the bread of life. All who
would overcome the flesh must set aside material beliefs and
dependence on the physical senses, then spiritual healing accom-
panied by a permanent realization of the Divine Mind will
manifest without interference.
Immortal
Prlliciples
Immortal principles govern the laws of life,
otherwise reproduction would cease. That
which will remain of the individual repre-
sents the eternal principle of being, and upon dissolution of this
body the inner self takes bn another body bf a more subtle
nature. The good deeds of one's life are the lights of life in this
32 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
spiritual body, Paul says "for this mortal shall put on immor-
tality". The identity remains the same as the earth identity in
a sense but the changed condition causes the necessity of spiritual
faculties of cognition. Human life is like a flame of fire, it is
lighted in the morning, it burns all day, and while it may be
called the same flame at night because it has continued to burn
all day, its essence is continually changing as the fire consumes
its fuel. The principle of the flame is eternal while the substance
or fuel is temporal, thus man continues to change, at childhood
he is one being, while in manhood he is the same identity, yet
every cell in his body has changed since he was a child. The
identity being of a permanent principle and nature, it does not
change continually as matter does, but grows and develops
and if one has the understanding of Divine Life and Truth it
takes on permanent qualities. The identity must renounce the
pomp and show of material change, and through a knowledge
of mind become immortal. The sinless life of Jesus gave Him
power over life and disease, and also made Him immortal. He
lived and had His being on the plane of His Heavenly Father,
and His attainment was reached by inward prayer, fasting and
mental concentration on overcoming the world of matter, sin
and disease.
At-one-ment At-one-ment in Christ gives one the power
in to heal the sick and live a life of unselfish
Christ love, it draws one away from the changing
delusion of the corporeal world. The firmness of our resolve to
reach the inner reality of Spirit will bear fruit according to our
effort in overcoming the flesh. "Seek the kingdom of God or
Good and all else shall be added unto you" is the Divine promise.
If the student of life is sincere in seeking the kingdom within
he will ever turn away from the babble of the unlearned, away
from material sensation to dependence upon the Christ Spirit
which is stronger than the flesh. One who knows the Truth-will
be willing to "work out their own salvation", while mental
weaklings desire the prayers of others to attain salvation for
them.
Holy
Sacraments
Holy Sacraments are only symbols, and are
worth only the mental value of truth which
they suggest to the mind. God did not design
them or ordain them, they were written by man, and however
good they may seem, they are of mortal significance only. Only
SACRAMENT AND SALVATION 33
the desires of the heart which manifest in those who partake
of them are Go_
dly, if their desires are unselfish and of
the Christ Spirit. Those who believe they can sin and escape
payment of their debt to God's laws through the remission
powers of a Sacrament or the application of so-called Holy
Sacrament are deluded by a belief that God condones their evil
deed. Super Mind Science places the responsibility of deeds
upon the one who commits them because every day we t:ee
suffering caused by sins against the laws of Nature. The only
true remedy for suffering is to break the attachment of the mind
to material pleasure and all things temporal, desiring only
spiritual power and Divine wisdom from the "kingdom of God
within". Final deliverance is reached through mental effort, and
no amount of vicarious effort on the part of another can change
the necessity for this mental effort, for all sin is mental, likewise
all atonement.
Lost
Souls
Those who are so unfortunate as to believe
that they can wait until they are ready to
b.y this mortal body down before seeking
spiritual deliverance from sin and then attain salvation im-
mediately, are the ones who comprise the legion of "Lost Souls".
Inertia is death-action is life, therefore effort represents accom-
plishment while postponement represents failure. Those whose
faith is for death alone will find life a ha:rd master for "the way
of the transgressor is hard". Inne illumination through self
control is the remedy for the ills of this world and an assurance
of eternal life in the invisible world or "our Father's house of
many mansions"
Self
Development
Self development comes from self reliance,
weakness comes from depending on others.
Super Mind Science instructs more than it
sympathizes. The fact that one is willing to fight the battles of
life is good cause to believe that they will win, only quitters and
doubters are among those listed in the book of life as failures.
Mental Science gives one the strength of mind to resist becoming
one of the vast multitude who are the sufferers of this world.
Divine law and justice demand the reformation of the sinful
mind, not a re-statement of a dogmatic belief. The process by
which man is made a new creature is the "renewing of the
mind", a development of that "mind of mastership which was
in Christ Jesus". The laws of Divine Mind demand that man
seek the Truth for the Truth will never seek man. If the
34 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
reader would become master of life's problems then he must
decide first .to be an open minded seeker. The true salvation of
man is to withdraw from the world of physical senses and enter
into that Divine peace within. Those who pray to God to help
them in their unbelief demonstrates the truth- that no one can
govern their mind until they learn the laws of ~ind. As faith
is mental, it is acquired by a form of concentration, therefore
those faithless mortals need to understand concentration.
Theological
Speculation
The ruination of lives on every hand is·
being witnessed because of the erroneous
theological speculations which favor the
weakness of the flesh. Theology speculates on the crucifixion as
·a ready means of forgiveness for weak mortals who live for
pleasure only, but when misery overtakes them they appeal to
God. This speculation fails to understand the philosophy of self
mastery which was unfolded to the world through the cruci-
fixion. The cross is a lesson in "spirit over flesh", "mind over
matter", it teaches to the intelligent the lesson of overcoming a
world of misery, sin and lust, also the glory of a spiritualized
being who lives independent of matter, and shows the unreality
of death to those who are truly enlightened. The appearing of
Jesus after death proves the eternal reality in the principle of
spiritual identity manifest in all who "doeth the Will of the
Father". The ideal of God, manifest in Jesus 'resides in all, but
the proper way to bring it forth has been misconstrued due to
the theological tendency to teach the remission of sin more than
the mastery of the cause of sin, the flesh. The idea that the
material blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sins is extremely
lacking in spiritual ideality, it resembles the Pagan view rather
than the Christian. His life was the beginning of a new spiritual
understanding of God, therefore the shedding of blood would
denote His great self control and power which made it possible
for Him to challenge physical death and become its master. We
also learn the lesson that if one is "at one with the God Spirit"
it matters little what sinful minded men may do against us or
what happens to the physical body for, as Jesus said before
Pilate, "my kingdom is not of this world". The demonstrations
of Jesus does not set aside the demonstrations of power others
ai;e supposed to show the world in order that they may be "doers
of the Divine works". Constant preaching without teaching is
not the remedy for the ills of man.
SACRAMENT AND SALVATION 35
Proof The requirements of those who are the fol-
of lowers of Jesus is that they perform the
Divinity demonstrations He taught His disciples. He
did not lessen the necessity of one knowing the "laws of life"
or demonstrating over sin, disease and powers of the adversary
(flesh) . Without complaint He carried His cross up the "road
of sorrow" to Calvary, for He knew how futile it was to try to
explain Divine laws of Being to a sinful world. The flesh seldom
hears the pleadings of Spirit, it more often persecutes those who
challenge its claims. The explanation of this inner foundation
of Truth is explained in Jesus' statements "I and My Father are
One" and "No man cometh unto The Father, except by Me",
meaning the universal Christ Spirit which H e manifested. This
Spirit when realized, heals the sick, lifts up the fallen and gives
rest to the weary. His resurrection proved that H e was Master
of the "Science of Life" for he raised Himself according to a
previous prediction. A belief in life would not have accomplished
this wonderful demonstration, only a knowledge of the "Science
of Life" could have given Him an accurate understanding of His
ability to survive death.
Spirit Jesus proved that matter and Spirit cooperate,
m because the same Jesus seen in the flesh was
Matter the one and same raised from the dead. He
did not deny matter. He overcame it with the power of Spirit.
In demonstrating the power of Spirit in those afflicted with
disease, He also healed them, which proves the truth of Pan-
theism, for H e raised the flesh body to glory as well as the
spiritual ~ody. He proved by demonstration that God operates
through the power of the consciousness and mind of man when
man has the correct understanding of "the power within". This
proves the doctrine of "there is no mind in matter" to be false
and a lie, and disproves the auto-suggestion used by so-called
Christians which is only a denial of matter, therefore false and
contrary to the doctrines of Christ.
Sectarian
Falsehoods
Numerous sects use the resurrection of Jesus
to prove the most impossible doctrines con-
ceivable by man. T o the Spiritualist His
resurrection was a proof of spirit return, which of course was
not the case. To the Christian Scientist it proves that the entire
physical universe has no existence. If this premise is true then
the physical Jesus had no existence, which is a complete denial
36 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
not only of the physical man Jesus, but also a denial of the reality
of the flesh existence of all people as well. To the Orthodox
Christian, Jesus is a blood sacrifice for the remission of sin and
His resurrection was to make it easy to obtain a pardon.
Super Mind To a Super Mind Scientist, Jesus' resurrec-
Scientist tion is an example of the highest form of
View mastership, given as practical proof before
the entire world, proving that each individual can master the
flesh, sin and disease. His healing was the best way to overcome
disease ever demonstrated on this earth and was- practical, not
theoretical. It was to teach the world a method of overcoming
pain, sin and sorrow by the application of a power which was at
that time unheard of. The laying on of the hands was a means
of contact between healer and patient, and a means of con-
trolling healing energy or life currents, a method which all
Super Mind Scientists understand. Jesus placed healing in the
Church and demonstrated it in the Temples showing He pre-
ferred it to preaching and not doing, and for that reason it
should be a practice in every Christian Church. Super Mind
Science gives as a part of its ritual a weekly service for the
benefit of all sick people where the Christ healing is performed
scientifically, using the forces of Nature as well as the Christ
power. Its aims is to re-establish Christianity in fact, not theory,
as it was demonstrated by Jesus Christ. Thousands of seekers
who have been healed is the p,roof that it succeeds.
Students The system of performing healing and other
of demonsti;·ations of power, including the relief
Jesus of mental obsessions, called "possessed of
demons" was a part of the curriculum tn the School of Disciples
taught by Jesus. There were seventy Disciples in all and only
eleven of them succeeded in learning His "Science of Life", while
the rest soon forgot His instructions. This proves the doctrine
that "the harvest is ripe, but the reapers few", for there is
always suffering and disease in the world to be overcome. The
ones who were faithful became great teachers, healers and
demonstrators of Divine powers which proved His science to be
"The light of the World". The same is true of all faithful
Super Mind Scientists, they overcome disease, poverty and sin,
however, "many are called but few are chosen". The few are
SACRAMENT AND SALVATION 37
the ones who are sincere and desire to become a demonstrator
of the Christ powers, the many are the unfaithful. Why are the
so-called Christians so opposed to the Christ healing? Do they
believe He can save the soul, but is powerless to even stop a
headache? Or is the God they worship weaker than man made
healing systems? The writer is inclined to believe that they lack
faith in the very doctrine they profess to believe. The Church
should be interested in a body and mind saving program for
"what profiteth a man if he should gain the whole world and
lose his soul", or what can he give in exchange for his soul?
Soul If a ceremony can save one soul by direct
Saving influence with God, then why can it not save
Ceremonies all souls at the same instant, for we are told
. that God is no respector of persons. The Science of Mind
teaches one that salvation is a mental process, therefore can be
better understood in Mental Science. No ceremony can take the
place of soul development, only the actual doing of good deeds
and the performing of J?ivine work is sufficient.
Authority The demonstrations of power which Jesus
of performed were the evidence of His Divine
Jesus authority. He challenged the Rabbis and
Priests alike to pr~ve their doctrines through works like He
proved His. They met His challenge by falsely accusing Him of
being a "winebibber and instrument of evil Bezelbub the
'Prince of devils'," The narrow minded of today accuse Mental
Scientists of the same evil, which. proves that there are few true
Christians. There are many modern Pharisees who masquerade
under the name of Christians, they have but changed their outer
form, like "white sepulchres, white without but corrupt within".
The Divine Mind Scientist knows that outer forms do not im-
press God, only the inner reality changes the results of acts and
deeds. Jesus came to prove how powerless the formal ceremony
of religion was, His idea was to establish a practical healing.
science and to show mankind how to overcome the flesh, thereby
contacting the Heavenly Father. The idea that God sends suffer-
ing on mankind is contrary to all teachings and demonstrations
given by Jesus. Man will continue to suffer until he understands
the God which Jesus worshipped, the God of mastery over
disease. Sin, weakness and submission are mortal, while overcom-
ing is spiritual.
38 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Human
Relationship
Human relationship did not enter into the
picture of life which Jesus lived, for He
taught that a "Prophet was · not without
honor, except in his own country, and his enemies were those of
his own household". Many say "I would study and improve
my mind but my family objects"; these have failed to realize
that the all imp'ortant issue is to possess knowledge and know
God or be lost spiritually, and they usually suffer with disease
while on earth. The living Christ is the spirit within, those
who celebrate His death and fail to :6.nd Him in life are to be
pitied for their lack of understanding and censured for their
ignorance. Super Mind Scientists should heal them and try to
cause them to see the error of their ways.
Suffering
Predicted
Jesus sent His disciples into the world with
the injunction, "Behold I send you forth as
sheep in the midst of wolves, be ye therefore
wise as serpents and harmless as doves". The true disciples of
Christ of today would do well to observe this command, for they
face the same problems today which the disciples of the Master
faced then. When you suffer for the cause of righteousness,
remember it is "the cross to be borne" which Jesus described,
and never resent persecution because it helps to develop the
spiritual nature of those who must bear it.
Spiritual The spiritual birth of Jesus illustrates "mind
Birth of over matter" in the true sense of the word,

Jesus said "call no man on earth Father, for there is but one
Father of all, the Heavenly Father". Those religions who call
their Priests "Father" are severely rebuked by this Scripture.
They should remember the commandment "Thou shalt have no
Gods before Me". The Christ spirit has been forever as prin-
ciple Divine, the inner spark of Divinity in every individual.
The The Wise Men "from the East" were spirit-

they brought were of little significance.
SACRAMENT AND SALVATION 39
Man a Man as a "Son of God" is a truth, not a
Son of theory. Jesus said "Ye are sons of God",
God and "Ye and Me are brothers", which
describes man as he is, spiritually. Super Mind Science has
proven by the demonstrations of power and the glorious at-one-
ment methods of mind power that His words were scientifically
correct.
Life Our lives should be a sacrament unto the
a Most High, continually observed in the
Sacrament chambers of the mind. This type of sacra-
ment makes life a pleasant journey and gives one peace of mind,
for every time we overcome as taught in Super Mind Science we
learn that delusion and the. unwareness of God .within has pro-
duced our trouble. All should learn to roll the materialistic
stone away from the body, which is the tomb of the soul, and
awaken to a life of Light and Truth through demonstration of
Divine Mind power.
His Cup When Jesus was about to be crucified by the
of ignorant multitude, He realized what was to
Sorrow come, saying "Father if it be Thy Will that
I shall drink this cup, let it not pass from Me, Thy Will not my
Will be done." In that spirit He gave His life because the
religions of His day hated the demonstrations of power which
He gave, they were jealous of the spiritual reputations which He
enjoyed. So likewise today the religions of materialism dispute
the power and demonstrations of Divine Mind, but "children
of light be not weary in well doing, your reward will be either
in this world or the next".
Christ, The The suffering on The Cross of Calvary was

Being suffer. This suffering, however, was real as
far as mortal perception is concerned.. How empty is the claim
of those mortals who say the flesh is an illusion and does not
exist. When compared with the supreme sacrifice of Christ
which was His "mortal body", they should hide their face in
shame for trying to take away from Him the glory of "over-
coming the flesh". They use the most unintelligent form of
hypnosis and the power of auto-suggestion, but would they
"drink His. cup"? or would the Orthodox Christian drink it?
Have they shared the blood of "The New Covenant", the perse-
cution which comes to those who do His Divine Works?
40 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Christ's
Ascension
Instead of celebrating Christ's death as is the
custom, Christians should celebrate His
"overcoming death". His glorious ascension
after His :final meeting with His disciples lets us know now that
"the Comforter has come'', and also the "Spirit of Truth" which
was promised by the Master, for the blind see, the deaf hear
and the lame walk.
Life Super Mind Science was revealed to the
and author while he was blind and c:onvalescing
Light on a bed of sickness where the only mortal
hope was death. While the mortal darkness and helplessness
of matter seemed insurmountable, from the inner recess of his
being came Light and Life. His sight and health returned and
this wonderful Science was porn from the demonstration of a
super power in Nature. Di~ine, Unconquerable Infinite Spirit
which controls the energy of life, heals mankind's ills and lights
his way to "the throne of grace".
Illumination
With victory over disease and the flesh,
comes illumination and direct knowledge of
God, a permanent channel of communica-
tion between man and His Heavenly Father. The realization
that this power and light is universal reforms the sinner and
takes away the pleasure or illusion called pleasure, found in
violating the laws of life.
Material
Rituals
Material rituals are empty in comparison to
the inner illumination which purifies the
mind, cleanses the body and lifts the con-
sciousness to unknown heights of joy and peace. Every Super
Mind Scientist who has overcome disease and sin has experienced
that touch of. Divinity which is a part of the demonstration of

This Divine communion with Christ should be

of our scientific realization of "the power within" one needs
the actual contact with the Master. As followers of Jesus we

are to emulate Him and imitate His mighty works, for we have
the promise that "these works shall Ye do and even greater ·
works shall Ye also do".

Calvary of the flesh is the parting of the ways with our worldly
associates and companions in sin; the light of the world is
attainment of spirituality. When one constantly contacts the
Christ spirit, He becomes their beacon on the sea of Life.
Selfish
Mentality
Those who are selfish minded, having no
time to do the Divine works, will awaken to
a gray dawn in the final analysis from their
conscience within. Jesus said we should attend to Our Heavenly
Father's business, "heal the sick, preach the Truth and do all
things which He has commanded us to do". This shows how
empty is that selfish life where the Father's business is neglected ·
and the fruits of Divine labor are lost. The record of suffering
of those who do the Divine Will is the strength of the church,
for it proves mastery over the flesh and complete ·renunciation
of the flesh world for the unselfish Life Divine. The author
long ago decided that a material life has nothing to offer except ·
misery, sin sickness and death.
False
Doctrines
Jesus said to His Disciples "these signs shall
follow them that believe; they shall speak
with new tongues, and if they drink any
deadly thing it shall not harm them, they shall lay hands on ·the
sick and they shall recover". He did not say "My Disciples
shall do this but them (meaning believers) in all times to ·come
shall not possess this Divine power". These negative teachers
of false doctrines who say that laying hands on the sick is mes-
meric should read the instructions of the Master to His Disciples.
He did not say "give suggestions to the sick o:r deny the existence
of a disease, or pray for the sick", He said "they shall lay
HANDS on the sick and they shall recover." Any so-called
religions which deny this healing are, according to Jesus,
unbelievers.
42 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Jesus spoke of the many substitutes which
would be offered for His demonstrations,
Many
Substitutes
some saying I cast out demons in your name,
others claiming other rewards for services rendered in His name.
But to all substitutes for His genuine works of Spirit He said
"depart from Me Ye workers of iniquity, I know Ye not".
Modem
Pharisees
Those who say "I was healed by medicine"
or "I take communion" and others who say
"I deny matter" will all be included in the
curses placed upon the Pharisee, "who hath ears but hears not,
and eyes but cannot see," for only the Divine works will prove
the Christian Spirit of an individual. Super Mind Science
teaches that this work must be accomplished and there is no
other way of atonement or at-one-ment. The passing into
immortality should be done while living instead of waiting until
mortal death, for only such identity as we build will be all that
we can hope to possess after mortal death.
The false belief that the soul is not in the

Beliefs
body is mental suicide, for it tends to sep-
arate consciousness from mortal existence;
such false beliefs cause much suffering in the world. The soul
is the consciousness within of right and wrong, the soul center
is in the Solar Plexus where the soul judges every thought which
enters into our passageways of life energy and impulse.
It is but natural that if we are to save the
Man's
Being
soul we must save the body, for man's being
cannot be separated. Saving's one's soul in
the church while their body is in the infirmary is impossible, and
premature death is the price paid for ignorance of this principle.
Man may walk a flowery path filled with sweet oratory while
here on earth but his soul will find him out and he shall pay the
price for neglecting his being. Sins of omission are as great as
sins of commission regardless of whether the sinner is ignorant
of the law of life violated or not.
Death
Overcome
Jesus overcame death because of His mental
and spiritual power; His victory was the
reward for healing the sick and doing the
Divine works, not because He believed in a certain sectarian
belief. Facts anci demonstrations are scientific and mark the dif-
ference between Truth and false concept. When we say Mi~d
we mean all intelligence. Science of Mind is the power that
SACRAMENT AND SALVATION 43
comes from correct scientific demonstration of Divine Mind which
gave Jesus victory over sin, lust and the body. That Truth and
Science is the same today as then; we call it Super Mind Science
because it is the highest realization of the scientific demonstra-
tion of the power of Mind and God. This Science has proven
thousands of times that it overcomes disease and is mankind's
Comforter, the spirit of Truth.
CHAPTER lV
THE HOLY EUCHARIST AND DIVINE SCIENCE
"/and My Father are One"-]Esus.
At-one-ment is the mental contact of mortal
Atonement man with God-the complete purification of
the body, symbolized by bread, and the
mind symbolized by wine. The evidence of atonement is
at-one-ment with God. Through this Divine mental unity,
disease disappears and physical and mental harmony is established.
In Super Mind Science the student is taught how to attain
Divine unity through generating life energy and then how to
form a mental contact with bliss. While experiencing this bliss
God manifests, this establishes actual contact with the Infinite,
rights all wrongs and makes one strong spiritually.
Responsibility The Divine Sacrament in itself cannot purify
for one, it is only a symbol no matter how per-
Actio11s formed. Jesus did not intend to relieve one
of their responsibility and thus encourage weakness. He intended
to charge everyone with their duty and then He instituted the
Last Supper as a symbol of at-one-ment of Him, His Disciples
and His Father. When mentally contacting God, one should
remember "I and My Father are One" and "He who seeth Me
has also seen the Father", "I am in you and you are in Me,
Christ Jesus". The purification of mind comes from doing the
Divine Will of Him who sent us into this world. The act of
partaking of the Holy Sacrament or the Eucharist is not enough,
for Jesus urged His followers to do His Works, and to use the
communion only as a remembrance of Him, and to remember
"Thou shalt worship no Gods before His Father who is in
Heaven" (meaning invisible). The at-one-ment of Christ
with God overcame the world (death) for death is of the
world.
Jesus
Sinless
Jesus was sinless because He overcame the
influence of His body over His conscious•
ness by fasting forty days in the wilderness.
In doing this, He rejected the materialism of a temporal kingdom
presented to His spiritual consciousness ru; His highest nature, by
thoughts Cir <!-dversaries. His power to rebuke the adversary
THE HOLY EUCHARIST AND DIVINE SCIENCE 45
demonstrated the sinless nature of the Divine Mind fully mani-
festing through ~im. The overcoming is mental, therefore no
physical ceremony can take its place.
His
Teaching
Renounce the physical world and all it stands
for, as all power belongs to God. Return
blessings for curses, and do good unto those
who use you ill, overcome evil with good, disease with power
(energy) and darkness with light, then you will know the nature
of God. ·Submission to disease or evil demonstrates a lack of
wisdom and leads one to destruction, regardless of how many
ceremonies he may indulge i?.. Jesus disregarded all formal
religion and taught by demonstration, offering· that as His ·
authority, without asking endorsement from anyone on the
mortal plane. He was fearless and positive, never taking a
negative position. He taught by symbol and parable so that
there would be many interpretations which are necessary to
satisfy the different degrees of intelligence in the world. The
universality of His teaching may be seen in the meaning of the
parables.
Victory Ceremonies will not result in deliverance
Over from mortality, for "faith without works is
Death dead" and "works without wisdom a~e
dead". Those who believe that Jesus came to deliver dishon.est
persons from punishment by providing a means of escape, and
that His suffering will earn them a heavenly reward are cer-
tainly ignorant of the true nature of God. True reformation is
a mental process, not a physical one. Can the body sin when the
mind is pure? Can the pure minded sin and transgress the
Divine law? Or can one who is positive and creative mentally
become a destroyer physically? All logic points to the fact that
evil is negation, and spirituality is mental positiveness. Reforma-
tion then, is to possess mind and body control oy being a positive
master of creation. Super Mind Science teaches the proper way
to reach this Super Mental State-"seek and Ye shall :find".
Victory over death means a positive spiritual "eternal conscious-
ness" of God.
.Material
Remedies
During years of suffering, the writer tried
many so-called healing remedies but most of
them proved worthless and many were a
detriment more than a help. Finally despairing of :finding
material remedies of value in mastering the cause of disease, he
46 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
turned to the study of Divine Mind as a remedy. The methods
of study were concentration and meditation and a diligent search
of the Scriptures until :finally the truth .about disease was re-
vealed. Disease is congestion and is the result of sin or violation
of Nature's laws. Material Sciences have given many fanciful
names to the numerous diseases which afflict mankind, yet all
of them are the result of congestion and lack of life energies
me~lly, physically and spiritually. There is but one remedy,
expansion, this comes from applying energy. Super Mind
Science teaches how to demonstrate this healing energy after
only a few minutes practice. This method is the result of years
of study on tlie part of the Founder, for many theories of heal-
ing and auto-suggestion were tried before the tapping of this
energy became a reality. The only true means of healing the
body is through this energy and the mind, regardless of what
method is applied. Medicine arouses a little of this energy which
accounts for the healings through the use of medicine, the same
can also be said of other healing systems.
God When Jesus healed the sick He taught "it
and is not I that doeth these things, but Him
Energy who sent me"; this is the highest truth about
healing. Medicine or Healers do not heal the sick, it is God in
Nature which alone heals. Every year hundre~s die who have
relied on medical remedies yet Theology endorses the use of
medicine.. The two, Theology and medicine work hand in hand
and the sick, the poor and demented are the victims. Super
Mind Science reveals to the seeker the direct way to control the
en'ergy which performs all healing, therefore it is the most suc-
cessful way of energizing the body and overcoming the ills of
humanity. Materialists try all different types of remedies but
ignore the true remedy, the Christ energy and power, and they
suffer as the result of their ignorance. Would God create man
and make him a slave to drugs which man himself creates? No,
for God is Creative, Energy, Power, Truth, Love and Light, the
opposite of disease which is darkness, congestion, sin and ignor-
ance. When Divine energy and power is used, disease becomes
powerless, for all evil and disease is the result of negation.
Power Jesus' demonstrations of healing stand out
of like a star in a dark night, and are beyond ·
God all concepts of mortal man. Mortal reme-
dies are paled into insignificance when one considers the energy
ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH 47
and power of God which flowed through the hands of Jesus
and healed the blind, the deaf and the lame.
Healing
Truth
When we read the letters received from
grateful people who have been rescued from
disease of every kind and description
through Super Mind Science, we are impressed beyond words
with the greatness of Divine Mind and energy. It is this power
and not cere~onies which Jesus came to establish.
Divine
Harmony
Why should man take communion when his
mind and body are out of harmony with
God? One should remember that demon-
stration of Divine power alone proves at-one-ment with the
Infinite Father. The view which some hold that the sacrifice
of Jesus is sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world is
erroneous, for each and everyone must give up the flesh and
all it stands for.
Blood
Sacrifice
Jesus is not a receptacle for sins and mortal
weakness. He stands as a Divine T eacher,
a torchlight to suffering humanity and not
as a blood sacrifice for the propitiation of the sins of the world.
If this were the purpose, then why did Jesus heal the sick, raise
the dead and pronounce all disease sin? Why all of these
demonstrations to prove He was a sacrifice for the rest of the
world? Was His raising from the dead a means of proving He
alone masters the sins of man?
Spiritual
Laws
Jesus' examples of power were to prove
that spirit (mind) is strong while the body
is weak. His teachings were the Science of
Life, that being the reason ·H e selected seventy Disciples and
taught them the laws of mind over matter, Spirit over flesh and
character stronger than temptation.
Raising Jesus' raising after His crucifixion was to

Dead is only a dwelling place of Spirit or inner
man. When the inner man is fully unfolded .he becomes

Jesus· said "I and My Father are one". The realization of the

weakness.

Reality Power is like electricity, until it is brought
of into action or demonstration it is unknown.
Power The works of Jesus were to make power
realized as objective as well as subjective. He showed the world
that the so-called laws of matter are inferior to spiritual power
and intelligence which actually rules the lower manifestations
oi.mind that we term matter. Super Mind Science goes on proving
and doing the Divine demonstrations,. showing the science Jesus
taught to be infallible and the greatest science ever discovered
by man. Every day we prove it superior to all mortal remedies.
Christ Christ is a universal principle and Jesus, the
a Universal man, attained to Christhood through mastery
Spirit of the flesh. The Christ principle is the idea
of the Divine sonship of God revealed in man. Jesus said "even
before the world I was in the bosom of My Father", showing
the eternal nature of the Christ Spirit. The virgin birth of Jesus
is to prove that the true fatherhood of man is God, the concep-
tion is to teach that God or Divinity is in every seed of life.
Man as Man as the Son of God overcomes the world
Divine Son of (flesh) and thus becomes the offspring of
God his Divine Father, the pure and changeless
Spirit of All-knowing, All-seeing Universal power. His work
of mastery over the elements, over disease and sin through
Divine power is "the light of the world". Jesus commanded the
people to worship God, His Father, and not Him, for well He
knew that the flesh dims the brightness of Infinite Light, Truth
and Love which is the only reality and power.
Materiality The betrayal of Jesus symbolizes the decep-
Versi.is tion of matter which denies Spirit. When
Spirituality they came to arrest Him, He said "are Ye
come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take
Me? I was with you in the Temple teaching and Ye took me
not, but the Scriptures must be fulfilled". Here carnal mind
used the forces of the material world to defeat the cause of
Spirit: ' Every ·day we seidul6Jlecl the -prophecy uf "matter seek-
ing to overcome the Son of God". The Scriptures have many
prophecies of this type, for the lower mentality which is nega-
tive, rebels against the higher which is positive, but finally the
higher proves its power over the lower. Thus again we learn
the power of Spirit.
THE HOLY EUCHARIST AND DIVINE SCIENCE 49
Saving
Power
When Jesus said "for whosoever will save
his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall
lose his life for my sake and the gospels,
the same shall be saved". This saying demonstrates that one who
overcomes the body and lives a true life is very often likely to be
attacked and killed by the materialists who preach saving through
· doctrine, instead of through Divine demonstration. When they
witness Divine power in action, they desire to obstruct it by sin
and the eliminating or destroying of the one who demonstrates
it. Those who demonstrate mind over matter, Spirit over the
worldly mind, cannot he destroyed, for they live on a plane of
eternal at-one-ment with the Divine Father. "The same shall be
be saved" shows the permanence of the Divine Father-Mother
God Spirit, which Jesus referred to as "Him who sent me into
the world''.
Kingdom The Divine" kingdom is here and now, not
of after death, and is proven in Mark 9:1, "and
God He said unto them, Verily I say unto you,
that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not
taste of death, till they ·have seen the kingdom of God come
with power". The doctrine that man must die and then await the
resurrection in order to realize God is the misconcept of carnal
mind. When at-one'ment becomes a reality one rises above the
limitations of the flesh while living on earth here and now. The
true power of atonement is at-one-ment mentally and spiritually
with the Divine Father. The demonstrations of healing the sick
and the giving of spiritual wisdom are the proofs of this Divine
attainment.
The
Passover
The Passover which Jesus ate with His
Disciples before His crucifixion was His last
farewell to the world of matter, His triumph
over the forces of darkness. Although a sad farewell to His
Disciples, it was the beginning of His greatest· success, the mas-
tery bf death, and victory over the grave. It was not a ritual
for the forgiveness or pardon of sins, it was a gesture of the
fearlessness and power of Spirit. It gave no cessions to mortal
laws, or any respect to the dead beliefs of the followers of Moses
who were to become the instrument of sin and kill Him for
His proof of the doctrine of the supremacy of Mind and Spirit
ove.r matter, disease, and all the illusions of a sinful and negative
world.
50 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
A
Test
Jesus asked them "can Ye drink of the cup
that I drink of, and be baptized with the
baptism I am baptized with" and they said
unto Him, "we can". This was their great test, for that cup
meant to stand the death of the physical body knowing, "Ye
shall not be harmed, for you are not the body, but the Son of a
living God". In Super Mind Science, the true Disciple will
learn the true meaning of taking this cup. We have proven
that man is not confined to his body but is a free agent in the
universe, that he can lay down his mortal cloak and travel the
heavenly way while his body rests in slumber, for death is only
a sleep to those who know this Divine power.
Truth Jesus looked upon them and said, "with men
and it is impossible but not with God, for with
God God all things are possible". Here the flesh
and all of its negative doctrines of impossibility is rebuked and
we learn that nothing is impossible to God. This includes heal-
ing the body, controlling the elements, the power to raise from
the body with consciousness and power, and illuminating the
understanding with Infinite Mind. The "bitter cup" of Jesus
was His persecution. Are you as a Christian ready to be reviled
for doing His Works? If so you drink from the "cup of bitter-
ness" from your associates when you prove to them the Science
of Mind over body.
Carnal
Mind
Most people seem to think that practicing
the science which Jesus demonstrated is a
disgrace. They forget that the Apostles
were stoned as they passed from city to city healing the sick,
which was works of the Church which Jesus founded. The
Apostles were not ashamed of His science, but the Elders
scoffed and said "what fanatical work is this", and declined to
have anything to do with such a new religion where the fol-
lowers were healers.
Orthodox
Church
For that reason the church of Jesus soon
ceased to be, and an Orthodox form of wor-
ship based on the letter was founded three
hundred years afterward. In it the sick were scorned and
placed in hospitals and yet the cup and bread were passed, using
it only as a symbol, rejecting is as a practice. Here and there
a healer and Christian would come into understanding and
THE HOLY EUCHARIST AND DIVINE SCIENCE 51
rebuke this form of hypocrisy and they would be burned at the
stake, the Church being the persecutor. The suffering of
martyrs was intense and the world witnessed the fulfilling of
the persecutions foretold by Jesus.
Power "Blessed are Ye when they revile you and
of persecute you for My name's sake"-Jesus.
Spirit This should be the attitude of ·an who can
demonstrate Super Mind Science, take your persecution in
silence and enter Divine mental communion. The Comforter
that was to come is none other than the Truth and power as
demonstrated in Super Mind Science.
CHAPTER V
SOUL DELIVERANCE
"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which despitefully use
you, and persecute you; That ye may be chil-
dren of your Father which is in heaven: for He
maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the
good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the
unjust."- JEsus.
Forbearance The doctrine of Soul Deliverance from suf-
and fering taught by Jesus Christ requires the
Self Mastery greatest mind control and spiritual wisdom,
for only with such understanding can one turn the other
cheek and invite the enemy to proceed with their idea of physi-
cally administering justice. Those who have known contact
with God within know that God manifests Love, therefore
regardless of what others do or say against us, we must never
lower our consciousness to their plane of thought. If we do, we
lose control of our mentality and sin against the All-knowing
Divine Spirit within.
Violation of Love No one who would kill his enemy can ever
Idea Is claim the right to soul salvation regardless
· Unchristian of what anyone may say on this subject.
Those who use physical force and kill so-called criminals are
more criminal than the one they kill, for they deliberately vio-
late the idea and principle of Christ Love with full intention to
destroy a so-called "enemy of society". Is society greater than
God, or can society forgive them for killing their enemy?
Regardless of whether the killing be personal or political they
are condemned by the law of Love. One may live down the sin
of being a party to the killing of a criminal if they fast, pray,
repent and demonstrate Divine Mind Science; otherwise their
souls are .lost for they fall under the condemnation of the Ser-
mon on the Mount uttered by Jesus shortly before He was mur-
dered in the name of "legal capital punishment". How anyone
who claims to be a Christian, hoping for immortality can become
a party to such gross violation of the law of Love, and hope for
SOUL DELIVERANCE
deliverance and salvation is indeed a great mystery, for it is
next to impossible for them to attain it.
War
Denounced
Jesus said "Those who kill with the sword,
shall die by the sword", meaning the spirit-
ual sword of guilt upon the conscience
which causes the second death, or loss of "eternal conscious-
ness". Jesus did not say this law would be suspended in case
of war, for the Divine laws of Mind and Spirit are immutable
and no amount of praying or sacrificing can change the law.
One may change the conditions of their own mentality to con-
form with the 'Divine law, providing they know the Science
of the Mind. If they do not ?Vercome their sin while on earth
it will overcome them in the next expression of life. If Jesus
were on earth He would say, ''rather than kill your fellowman,
accept death of your body and save your soul for he who dieth · ,
for My sake shall live again". Upon these grounds of facts, Super
Mind Science denounces war and killing in any form.
Christian
Hypocrisy
Hypocrites who love the ways of sin and
spiritual darkness say that the doctrine of
Christ is not practical. This is because they
da not desire to give it a trial, they desire a life of sin, a death-
bed repentance and a heavenly reward for wrong doing, but
0, how foolish they are to think that God is deceived. Jesus
said "I am the Way_ and the Life, you cannot serve Mammon
and God at the same time". If the teachings of Christ are not
practical to live by they will serve little benefit to die by. When
one attains mind control they find that the Life Divine is the
most satisfactory and the most practical to live by. Having
overcome their lower nature, ceased to eat of flesh and corrupt
food, they see how foolish it is to be ·attached to the things
which kill; they become clean mentally, physically and spirit-
ually and attain supreme happiness in the knowledge of "eternal
consciousness". They become attached to God, and are lovers of
the Divine work, healers of the sick and helpers of humanity.
Unimportance Jesus said to His Disciples "no man can
of serve two Masters, for either he will hate
Physical Comfort the one and love the other or else he will
hold to the one and despise the other; Ye cannot serve God and
Mammon, therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your
life, what Ye shall eat, or what Ye shall drink nor yet for your
body what Ye shall put on; is not the life more than meat and
54 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
the body more than raiment". This doctrine requires the giv-
ing up of earthly ties and ideas in preference for the Divine life
of Truth and Love. It· shows the unimportance of all our
earthly cares and teaches the doctrine of attachment to God
through the understanding of "eternal consciousness". Seek not
the things which create material attachment, but break down
the barriers of flesh by the power of Will and Mind.
,Whited Those who call themselves Ministers of God,
Sepulchres claiming· the power to "save souls", yet
of Today endorse killing in law and war are denounced
by Jesus who says "for Ye are like unto whited sepulchres which
indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead
mens bones and of all uncleanliness, even so Ye also outwardly
appear righteous unto men but within Ye are full of hypocrisy
and uncleanliness". These modem Pharisees endorse war, cap-
• ital punishment, physical torture of the so-called "enemies of
society", imprisonment of children whose mentalities are nega-
tive; they persecute Divine healers and then ·utter long prayers
in public to impress a sin loving world.
Selling They sell their soul for political advantage,
the not knowing that "eternal consciousness" is
Soul the only ·reality in human existence. They
should be able to read the Scripture with the pure eye of Spirit
and see how millions daily lose their soul in exchange for
worldly misery, woe, sin and disease. Eternal consciousness
would reveal this to them should they seek.
Heavenly
Harmony
Which is best, to sing a hymn to the physical
senses or to attain to heavenly harmony?
Heavenly harmony adjusts one's entire life,
overcomes disease and sin, lifts up the fallen and rights all
wrongs. The soul desires this harmony while the body seeks
darkness, the battle between these forces is but a manifestation
of the laws of gender of the mind. Super Mind Science teaches
the methods which is the keyboard that produces the music of
the soul, demonstrating the absolute power of creative Infinite
Spirit, All-knowing, Eternal Universal Mind.
Those who desire Soul Deliverance will have
Soul
to follow in the footsteps of the Master and
bear their Cross. The precepts which con-
form to the teachings of the Master are also in Super Mind
Science; they can be briefly stated as follows:
Deliverance
SOUL DELIVERANCE 55
First. Non co-operation or participation in any type of killing
or committing of a destructive deed.
Second. Mind and body control, attainment of the knowledge
of the universal principle of Love, which is spiritual illumina-
tion through doing unselfish deeds.
Third. Becoming master of the art of concentration of the mind
in order to attain mental purification, meditation in order
that the soul wisdom may manifest, subduing of the flesh
influence over the consciousness, ceasing to desire to sin;
learning the art of passing beyond matter mentally at Will,
or attainment of the eternal consciousnes.s which Jesus
demonstrated on the forty day fast "before overcoming the
body".
Plan This is the plan of salvation of Super Mind
of Science and is the safe road to immortality,
Salvation it may seem difficult, but sweet .is the nectar
of life to those who live in "Life Divine". Every battle with
the flesh makes the individual stronger to resist temptation and
sin, for Mind is Master.
Other Roads The idea that everyone who prays a prayer
to of belief is saved from sin is preposterous
Spirituality and can easily be disproven. Many who
think they are saved by such a simple process are often later
found in misery, attacked by disease, courage gone a.nd the "tur-
bulent waters of life" or mortal consciousness disturbed to the
extent that life seems not worth living. The cause lies in the
fact that the lower nature and carnal mind still rule in that per-
son's life, if they were on the correct road to spirituality they
would be masters of health, doers of the Divine works, healers
of the sick and would possess a calm Mind. Those who have at-
tained to a little understanding of the great Light of Life "eternal
consciousness", pass beyond this state of woe forever for they
become master of self and cease to submit to matter.
·Supreme
Enlightenment
Enlightenment is a mental process, not phy-
sical. One may possess great secular knowl-
edge and yet be lacking in soul enlightenment,
for the road to such mental illumination is the path of mental
humility. Regardless of how great the wisdom of man may be,
it is limited while its Creator is Universal and Unlimited.
Supreme soul enlightenment comes to those who attain a well
controlled Mind, it is the result of understanding the state of
56 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
"eternal consciousness". Those who are unwilling to overcome
the flesh and all of its false promises will fail to understand
Super Mind Science or apprehend its true importance.
. Work The spiritually minded take pleasure in lay-
of ing hands on the sick, controlling the healing
Love energies and stopping the pain and suffer-
ing of humanity. This willingness to help others is a part of
the program of Soul Deliverance as taught in Super Mind
Science. "Give unto the world that which you would have God
give unto you" is the motto of all Super Mind Scientists.
Light The Master said to His true Disciples "Ye
of the are the light of the world", "a city that is
World set on a hill cannot be hid", this was
because He had taught them how to heal the sick and teach
people the Truth, it was not because they believed in a sect or
preached certain precepts. His f eference to a city set on a hill
refers to those who demonstrate the pow:ers of Spirit over matter,
or who are conspicuous because of the good they do. Super
Mind Scientists instructed in the keys of power contained in the
methods of the Science and who live the life, are able to perform
the spiritual demonstrations which made the Disciples of Christ
outstanding.
Evil
Classified
Human ills can easily be classified in Mind
Science. Through understanding the nature
of disease and sin one can overcome the
cause. Mind manifestation is of the ;two genders of mind,
one creates through Divine harmony, while the other gender
can become out of harmony with Divine laws and cause almost
any kind of trouble. Positive mind force which is the Father-
hood principle represents health, success, wisdom, mastership,
truth, love, endurance, creative life and light. Neg~tiy_e mind
force, the feminine gender of mind represents the Mother:hood
principle so long as it harmonizes ~th the Fatherhood principle
or masculine gender of mind. When it leads and overpowers
the positive gender, inharmony in mentation is the result which
in turn produces sin, disease, sorrow, suffering of many kinds,
ignorance, superstition, lack of self control and mortal delusion.
Goodness
Attained
True goodness requires a positive mentality,
which gives one the power to overcome evil.
By becoming positive and overcoming the
leadership of the negative state of mortal consciousness one
SOUL DELIVERANCE 57
attains liberation froin flesh influence, becomes an excellent
healer, a wonderful teacher of others as well as the most com-
mendable example of the Christ Wisdom. This is the reason
every method in Super Mind Science is positive.
Overcome Evil Jesus taught that if someone smites you on
with the cheek you should turn the other, by this
Good He meant one cannot correct an evil act by
comm1ttmg an evil themselves, the proper way being to over-
come evil with good. When one is tried in the fires of life it
requires great mental power in order to obey that law since the
impulse is to strike back at the one who strikes you. This
instruction shows the necessity of self control in order to make
it possible for one to live a Christian life.
Denouncers Those unfortunate mortals who denounce
of the Science of the Mind have yet to offer
Mind Science any other way by which man can attain the
self control which Jesus posses!>ed and taught His Disciples.
Every year larger hospitals and insane institutions are constructed
to take care of the vast army of suffering mortals who have
followed those who preach that mind control and Mind Science
is unnecessary. You never find a true "Mind Scientist" in such
places for inner knowledge of God overcomes all such calamities.
"The spirit is strong but the flesh is weak", yet many would tell
you that the flesh is strong and the spirit is weak. They lay
traps for themselves, dig ditches in the field of life theh fall into
them, for there is none so blind as him who will not see.·
The Law The higher law of life beckons the sincere
of student of life onward and upward toward
Spirit Divine realization and "eternal conscious-
ness". The price of victory may seem great, but there is no
hope in mortality. The law of the Spirit is opposite and away
from the desires of the flesh. Every day the two roads appear
on the horizon of life and the question to decide is, will the
pleasures of the flesh which produce misery be sacrificed for the
pleasure of the Spirit which produces "eternal consciousness"?
Super Mind Science says, "still the restlessness of the physical
sense and listen to the music of the soul; reach inward and
upward and attain to reality".
58 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Mental Ascension The law governing mental ascension above
to the sins of the world is one of dominating
Higher Life the lower and harmonizing with the higher.
The physical body continually suggests countless necessities
which in truth no one needs. The voice of the tempter is the
impulse of the carnal mind, but the student of the Science of
Life must learn to say "get thee behind me, Satan" and overcome
the wants of the flesh and develop the higher spiritual desires.
This is the path of mastership. The less attachments one has
to the mortal world the sooner they will attain to "eternal con-
sciousness", because the attachments to earthly things are
opposite to the Spirit.
Oneness When the Master was told His mother and
of brethren desired to speak with Him, He
Life stretched forth His hand toward His Dis-
ciples and said "behold My mother .and My brethren, for who-
soever shall do the Will of My Father which is in heaven the
same is My brother and sister and mother". He had attained to
"eternal consciousness" and knew the oneness of life, and also
that the "me" and "mine" phase of consciousness is mortal, not
eternal because it contains a selfish element. W e must rise
above relationship, possession and limitations, to the reality of
the unlimited eternal spirit of Life, Light, Truth and Love.
Breaking The author broke many mortal barriers in
of the pathway of life before the sunlight of
Barriers Truth was revealed to him, showing him the
cause of suffering and the way to peace. Finally the false show
of the senses and their false concept were overcome and the
obstructions were removed one by one. After a struggle with
disease and lower self he stilled the waves of flesh sensations and
was lifted up mentally beyond the veil of mortal life where
heavenly harmony and eternal light were revealed as the only
Eternal Reality. Since then it has been his desire to show the
way to Soul Deliverance to all who are willing to learn the
Science of Mastery.
A Glimpse When all mortal sensation had ceased and
of the the organs of sense perception had been
Real stilled through the art of mind control, the
author's consciousness entered the eternal state where the life
of all creatures was revealed to him as the life of God, where
the celestial music of Divine harmony sang the song of peace
'· -
SOUL DELIVERANCE 59
before the Throne of Grace, The Infinite Mind. . During this
period a glimpse of the reality flashed through the author's con-
sciousness and then and there he knew the claims of the flesh
to be false; the identity to possess an eternal quality, and God
as the "Father of Life". This revelation followed a long fast
and intense meditation on the Infinite Spirit. .The experience
cannot be described by ordinary speech, but~"seek and Ye shall
find", "knock and the door shall be openeq unto Ye". This is
the attainment of "eternal consciousness".
Health Following the attainment of enlightenment,
and health and peace came as a natural conse-
Peace quence. Aftei:. the author's ~nlightenment,
the passageways of "the energy ~f life" were revealed to him
and also the secrets of "the laws of life". Since that time
thousands have been healed through these laws and powers;
many students. of the Science have attained to "eternal con-
sciousness", and even children of tender years have gained a
knowledge of self control, and a glimpse of the reality of life
and God. Super Mind Science continues in its message of
power and mastery, it has endured its cross and is rising from
obscurity to a prominent place in many communities. Some day
it will be recognized for what it is, "The Science which Jesus
demonstrated", restored to a suffering world who are in need of
a surcease from pain. It is not a new belief, but is a Science
which all can demonstrate who are willing to overcome the flesh
and know the Spirit. If you would aspire to become one of us,
you must learn to know, for knowledge is power while
ignorance is sin; illumination is Soul Deliverance.
Cleanliness It is useless to observe only the laws of
of physical hygiene without also observing the
Mind and Body law of mental hygiene, which is to keep low
thoughts from disturbing the growth of the soul consciousness.
If we do not we corr;,e under the rebuke of Jesus who said,
"hypocrites observe merely the cleanliness ~f the outside of the
platter, while they neglect the inside". Many habits of
ignorance keep one from attaining Soul Deliverance. The habit
of earthly attachment and the wasting of time are among the
foremost of destructive habits, for low thoughts usually enter
idle minds since they find fertile field for expression in the con-
sciousness of those who find time only for selfish lusts and
enjoyment.
60 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Our If we would be "about our Father's business"
Father's as Jesus was, we must apply ourselves to
Business mastering the carnal impulses. Many loving
mothers take -up all their time teaching their children how to
play, neglecting to teach them anything about the mind or how
to think and later when they grow up and become criminal
they are at a loss to understand the reason why. The world is
full of misery because man has yet to learn how to enjoy life and
how to distinguish the real from the false. Jesus said " he that
soweth the good seed is the Son of Man", meaning that good
thoughts and mental training make man a ruler of his destiny.
Positive N ever submit to sin or disease, remember
Mjnd Jesus taught "be it according to thy will",
Power meaning you should mentally rebel against
all destructive forces, never saying that you cannot overcome.
Know that the kingdom of God is within, however it may
require positive mental determination to cause it to manifest
without. To be Super Minded you must learn to conquer evil
and all forms of negation, knowing that none of these can equal
the power of Infinite Mind. Your mind casts an image of your
beliefs and influences your life accordingly, therefore let your
mentality dwell only on facts and avoid negative influences.
Carnal
Mind
Carnal mind consists of the consciousness of
matter, it is not permanent or immortal in
quality. In order to understand Divine Mind
one must be able to overcome the consciousness of carnal mind.
Divine Mind consists of the knowledge of facts concerning life
and God and has nothing to do with beliefs, for would Divine
All-knowing Mind need to form a speculation regarding life?
In order to demonstrate the power of Divine Mind one must
overcome the delusions and conceited suggestions of carnal
mind. Whenever you have a disbelief or a doubt, that is carnal
mind making known its ignorance, when you have learned and
know a definite fact, Divine Mind has spoken. When the con-
sciousness dwells in carnal mind the result is sin.
Living In order to live in Truth one must cease tell-
in ing others their beliefs or disbeliefs, for Truth
Truth begins only where beliefs end. A wise per-
son always states what they know, a foolish mortal spends much
time discussing what they believe or disbelieve. God is the
creator of Truth, Truth being real it is easy to explain. N ot so
SOUL DELIVERANCE 61
many years ago this modern civilized world witnessed the whole-
sale slaughter of human beings, so-called Christians busy killing
other so-called Christians. The reason was a false belief that
the other nation was bad and therefore it was a blessing to
humanity to kill them. Such ignorance is the curse of the world
for one nation is no worse or no better than the others, only
belief makes them seem so.
All Nations All nations have sinned and fallen short of
Have the glory of God because ignorant people
Sinned were mis-instructed by an ignorant clergy.
Just so long as the clergy denounces Divine Mind Science and
stands for war and killing, that long will they fail to comprehend
Jesus Christ, and the world will continue to bow down to a false
soul saving. doctrine. Each individual must become his own
Saviour in a sense and take up his cross and follow Jesus.
The Path Mortal beings will cease to suffer only when
of they have learned the falsehood of beliefs
Peace and have attained to an understanding of
facts. Creeds were written by man, they may infer many
things, but they fall short in demonstrations. How many Chris-
tians can utter a prayer and cause an answer to be forthcoming?
The author has proven that when prayer is accompanied with a
knowledge of Divine Mib.d it is answered. When one learns_
the technique of demonstration they walk in the path of peace.
Mental
Reflection
While mentally reflecting on life, we per-
ceive that all greatness is due to the forming
of a powerful character. In order to bring
such character development forward one must think positive
thoughts, for negative and carnal thoughts are the seeds that
bring. forth corrupt fruit. Exertion of the Will assists one in this
direction, while the constant suggestion of an idea slows down
the process .of action. Action is life, inaction is death, therefore
the doing of good deeds should be continuous. One should be
careful what type of deeds reflect in their consciousness, for
science has proven that the subconscious mind of man is very
active every second during the day and night, it is performing
subjectively the deeds one has reflected mentally, therefore life
is a reflection of our mental action.
62 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Immortal
Principles
The immortal principles which should be
mentally reflected in one's mentality are
thoughts of Power, Truth, Love, Good deeds
and the liberation from flesh limitations. By so doing we build
a Divine personality and attain to "eternal consciousness" quickly.
Every Super Mind Scientist should remember to reflect only
good, speak only of good, and not visualize or reflect the things
that destroy, for our thoughts change the whole aspect of
our life.
Soul
Powers
The power of the soul is the Divine All in
All of Spirit, All-knowing, All-seeing, the
same Infinite Spirit which is the ruling, cre-
ating and animating force in the entire universe. Man's illu-
sion that his soul is other than this Divine influence is the cause
of much of the world's misery. Super Mind Science demon-
strates the Divine at-one-ment of man and God.. Mind is the
creator as well as illuminator of matter; everything in our life is
the result of the influence of mind over matter.
Constitution Man, like the universe, is created according
of the to the laws of gender of the mind, he is a
Universe universe within himself - a microcosm.
When he awakens to the soul consdousness of Life, Light and
Love he will find himself to be a manifestation of God, a Creator
mentally more than physically. The Universal Being whom we
term God represents all the positive good in the universe, while
the carnal individual produces all the negative results of life
which we term evil. God is the absence of evil and evil is the
absence of good.
Scientific The soul, in reality judges every thought,
1 Understanding condemning the bad and commending the
of Soul good, which proves soul to be a Divine
Mind function. After physical life, the soul becomes the con-
sciousness, providing it is surrounded by a record of good
deeds, for the soul with an evil environment must either over-
come the environment or lose its identity. This is the reason
that one should overcome earthly attachments while o~ earth.
In this manner they can attain to mastery of environment, over-
coming evil with good, and knowing God through "eternal con-
sciousness". The path of soul liberation leads away from selfish-
ness toward this universal "eternal consciousness" which is the
highest pinnacle reached through understanding of Divine Mind.

of the Infinite Spirit, the All in All in the u~iverse, the Uni-
yersal God Spirit or all pervading intelligence.
Matter-The agency through which mind expresses itself, three
dimensional.
Divine Mind-The·Universal consciousness of good only.
Science-That which can be demonstrated or proven.
Belief-A state of mortal mind, speculative-a supposition.
Eternal Reality-The Truth which changes not.
Teacher A teach~r of the laws of life can only point
and the way to Soul Deliverance, the student
Student must tread the path, having confidence in the
teacher and knowing ·God is Good.. This Science will only be
comprehended by those who desire to see beyond a changing
world; selfishness and personal beliefs can never change the laws
of life described in this Science. The change will be made in
the sincere student, for they will master disease and sin and learn
to know the eternal reality through overcoming the flesh senses
and unloading their consciousness. Then the consciousness may
soar beyond matter through the mental process of Soul Deliv-
erance until it cognizes the "eternal consciousness" or the posi-
tive understanding of soul immortality. Now that the way has
been shown, the student should begin today to control the lower
nature, set the Will and concentration against low desires, control
the thought power, generate life energy, then go on to accom-
plishment for "the vineyard is large but the reapers are few".
CHAPTER VI
RENUNCIATION
"The Lord said unto my Lord, sit Thou at my
right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
foo tstool."- PsALM 110.
Eternal
Know, Oh Disciples of Super Mind Science
that if thou livest in the Infinite Spirit, every
Victory
enemy including disease, sorrow, sin, nega-
tion of mind, personal feelings, attachments and earthly desi.res
shall indeed become thy footstool. If you will renounce creeds
made by men, personal vanity, and pursuit of the fleeting
pleasures, you can know God. Learn the power which comes
from exercising justice, kindness, gentleness and soft speech
which reflect the quality of the soul, practice mental content-
ment and mildness of temper, keeping a firm control over pas-
sions. In this way cause the soul to grow toward freedom and
away from the bondage of the flesh, overcome low desires by
loving your fellowman as yourself, but do all of these things
without thought of compensation. The hypocrites appear out-
wardly to be good, but inwardly they are corrupt, only those
who practice the arts of self control and gentleness are really
good. Seek to be the inner reality of Infinite Love, Wisdom
and Truth, renounce the selfishness of a man made heaven, the
folly of your forefathers, the low desires of your associates,
and become a Light on the pathway of life. Avoid outer actions
which will cause others to call you pious, remember only one
is perfect and good, that one is God, man may imitate God but
he can never equal Him.
Meditation Renounce false claims of saintliness, exhibit
and your good qualities as natural attributes of
Introspection your inner "I Am" consciousness. Renounce
all outward forms of worship designed to be seen of men,
acquire inner introspective spiritual vision through mentally
beholding God in every living cell. In the beginning before
Bibles were written, the Infinite Spirit appointed the teachers to
this world and each teacher appears when the evolution of man
demands his message. At the appointed time each teaches the
Truth suited to his day and age. The Truth is reasonable and

easy to understand, while falsehood is complicated and often
sl'oken in an unknown tongue. The teacher whose spiritual
vision is opened always teaches a provable philosophy, thts Truth
leads to freedom of the soul. Super Mind Science is an
appointed teaching and is also a Super Soul Science, it reveals
Truth and illuminates the path of life .foi:. all who are sincere
·seekers of reality. Dear reader, stop and think, is your soul in
bondage of fear, have you erected barriers between yourself
and the Infinite Mind by giving negative s~ggestions to your
own mentality? Let egotism and creedalistic hatred disappear
from your mental horizon, break the fetters of negation, do ·not
let anyone tell you they can. save your soul, for the absolute
truth is that you alone can save it. Accept only the reality of
God, reject dead beliefs.
Mind
Analysis
Inner devotion means inner contemplation,
for God is enthroned in the center of your
being, if you seek Him there you will find
that "peace that passeth understanding". The mentality must
be purged and analyzed in order that one may understand right
from wrong, love from hate, ease from disease. This mental
analysis must precede "soul freedom". When your soul is free,
it will become the vehicle of your consciousness and you, Dear
Reader, can explore the realm of soul even as you have explored
the physical realm, for through the illumination of the soul, and
mind analysis, we reach all planes of mind and also all planes
of soul. ·
The The author's vision, undimmed by ·flesh con•
Heavenly tact, has been able to explore that unseen
Realm realm where all spiritual life manifests in
its true radiance, for only fre-edom of soul and renunciation of
sin permit one to behold the heavenly hierarchy while yet in the
flesh. Jesus said "the kingdom of hea,ven is at hand", "know
ye not that the Father dwelleth within", "He who hath seen Me
hath seen the Father, for He is in Me and I in Him". Jesus had
renounced the flesh and all of its false show and had attained
"soul freedom". This freedom will come to all who break down
their small creedalistic consciousness, it is not a special gift; the
price of this freedom is tru~ spirituality. Will you Dear Reader
attain it? It is for you if you desire it enough to attain the con•
trol of the body and calmness of mind. You must see beyond
66 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
the clouds of worldly sen·se reports into the clear blue spiritual
ether where Infinite Spirit is All in All.
Angelic
Host
The Angelic Host is but the purified con·
sciousness of those who passed beyond mor•
tal delusion into spiritual reality. Your inner
qualities are the gateway to freedom, providing you see the light
of Truth and Love. In the progress of a soul, one must learn
that overcoming is a natural attribute of the spiritual self, it is
designed to deliver man from egotism·, tyranny, vain glory, lust,
anger, avarice, covetousness and low selfish deeds. All of those
dark principles must not only be renounced but overcome, that
the principle of Light, Truth and Love may shine forth. In
Super Mind Science the keys to concentration and spiritual
energy will solve this problem.
Spiritual
Birth
The idea of Super Mind Science is to over·
come sin, we do not seek a pardon or other
mental crutches, for man is now too depen·
dent on others. We teach a positive method of mental regenera·
tion, this new regeneration brings about the spiritual birth of
man, cleanses his mind, his body and his soul. Intellectuality with·
out accomplishment is like faith without works, it is dead. A
living faith needs to be accompanied by a living works,
(healing).
Inner
Light
low ideas. Inner
Inner worship consists of doing good deeds
without thought of gain, seeing reality and
keeping the mind clean, above all gossip and
zeal is a desire to serve the master "I Am"
consciousness within which leads one on to the supreme under·
standing. As for those misguided mortals who seek others to
save their soul, they are unfortunates produced by hypocritical
religious systems which have no spiritual merits. Their ignor·
ance and conceit follows them into their Church and Temples,
they pollute holy places with ·their evil minds and low
mentalities.
Whited
Sepulchres
Jesus called these mortals "whited sepul·
chres, clean without but corrupt within", for
being filled with false pride, power, ostenta·
tion and lust, they are consumed in the fire of hate and greed.
Nature will not preserve them, they are destroyed by a fire
RENUNCIATION 67
kindled within themselves. Their hell of low desires kindles
spiritual consuming :fires, and annihilation awaits them after this
life, for the law of compensation never forgets. The :fires of this
mental torment are fed by three powers, they are lusi:, anger
and hatred, and regardless if they are ignorant or not they will
stand before the judgment bar of life. At least their soul shall
be judged by the "I Am" consciousness within its own self, for
man is made in the "image of God" within, but not without.
The part of man which can be lost is his identity, his memory
or the mortal "me" consciousness. The "me" consciousness
should be merged with the soul through spiritual unfoldment as
taught in Super Mind Science.. Those who renounce the lower
nature will never know death, and if they understand the laws
of life as revealed in Super Mind Science they will never need
to suffer pain or sorrow.
Soul
Salvation
Soul salvation begins with this renouncing
and self mastery, and those who follow this
path are safe and will never taste of death.
Beware, however, that you do not go back to ignorance after
you have reformed, for if you do your progress will become
slower when you attempt self control again. Seek ever to attain
the Divine union, and remain ever steadfast, for sincerity is the
price of success. The soul desires contact with Infinite Spirit,
but only the delusive faculties prevent this happy and blissful
state from becoming a permanent reality in everyone's life. The
spiritual illumination of man is according to this Divine union,
each one reflects their own nature. Everyone's concept of God
and Good decides their lot as well as governs their deeds, there-.
fore seek to possess the highest good by having a high regard
for Good and God.
Devils Man's concept of the Deity is only himself
in One's magnified· to Infinity, likewise his devils and
Self hells are but himself at his worst, or express-
ing his lower nature, for every mortal can conceive only that
which is within himself. Every thought their conception
may suggest as a far away place or state is within themselves
only. Those who :worship personal Gods, worship only that
which consists of~1wn personality, their delusion of a per-
sonal God. in the sky is only a mirage on the horizon of their
desert within.
68 ETERNAL WISPOM AND HEALTH
God The true God of Infinity is beyond attri-
Is butes, powers, features and personality. One
Love who performs meditations on reaching the
domain of Infinity can best realize God by exerting strong devo-
tional love of the Infinite Spirit. The only true sacrifice is that
of selfishness, all other sacrifices are vain. God is Love and spirit·
ual love is an unselfish principle. Let those who desire to be
spiritual become unselfish, then the methods of self control and
analysis as taught in Super Mind Science will demonstrate as
perfect as the laws of Nature, for they are based on the laws of
Nature and God.
Renounce
Darkness
To know Love one must overcome hate, to
know power one must overcome weakness,
to know immortal mind one must overcome
mortal mind. Renounce darkness and cease to sin, for "this
mortal must take on immortality" as Paul expressed it. Mortal-
ity thrives in darkness while immortality is gained through light.
Lack of knowledge and understanding is but groping in the dark,
while having knowledge and understanding is the Light that
leads to wisdom.
Truth Truth cannot abide in ·one who lets their
and animal nature rule them, for light never
Light abides in darkness. When light enters, dark-
ness leaves, when Truth is known, ignorance is overcome. Seek,
therefore more light on the problems of life and more truth con-
cerning Infinite Spirit if you desire to overcome ignorance. You
are instructed to be ever calm in the face of adversity, overcome
like and dislike, remain unchanged in the face of criticism or
praise so that your consciousness may enter into Truth in its
fullness with the Light of God ever manifesting.
Inspire
Others
Knowidg God is Love, treat friend and foe
kindly, seeing God in both, however, do not
let your foe lower your thoughts to a lower
plane, but rather inspire them to do good by being an example
of goodness yourself. Be ever the same in honor or disgrace,
only know that within your conscience is light. When you give
light to the world you will receive more light from God, give
health to others you will receive health from the universe.
If one opposes the Truth in you, become a greater light of Truth
to them, willingly accepting your cross when it is the Will of
the Divine Father. .
RENUNCIATION 69
Persecutipn If someone persecutes you because of Super
by Mind Science, remember that Christ with ID
Others His power and glory was persecuted before
you. Overcome your attachment to the world and most of your
troubles will be over. Those who follow this doctrine will be
many times blessed, they will be more :fitted to enter the realm
of immortality in a body of light and power. This Truth was
revealed to the author through Divine revelation, after the
opening of the clear eye of Spirit within. Nothing can be added
to this Truth nor taken away, for it comes from the realm of
eternity. Renunciation of the lower self and all its delusion is
far better than meditation at periods on spiritual power. Those
who imbibe this living water of Truth must seek always to be in
constant communion with Infinite Spirit and become more and
more unaware of the glamour and false show of carnal mind.
Growing By adopting this attitude one grows in grace,,
in and life becomes like a sweet nectar, always
Grace pleasant, serene, calm and blissful. Jesus
called this "that peace which passeth understanding". Those
who abandon seeking for gain and glory, and who love their
fellowman are dear to the Infinite Intelligence. The author
would like to lead all to that Throne of Grace that they may
glimpse the beauty of that changeless realm which he was fortu,
nate enough to glimpse. "If thine eye be single, thy body shall
be full of light" is the Divine promise of the ages. Those who-
have such illumination are ever at home, contented and calm
in Infinite Spirit.
Constant Devotion should be a constant mental state,
Devotional not a spasmodic outburst of false enthusiasm.

calmness of mind :first so Divine power can manifest uncongested.
it is difficult for :finite mind to understand Infinite Mind, the

opens the spiritual vision of_ mankind. Austerities and fasting
are worth only the value that is placed on them by the mental
intention of the one who fasts. The subduing of the lower
nature is a mental process, not a physical one, the physical aspect
of the battle with lower nature is the least important. Matter

guages God and Good are words which proceeded from a com-

mon origin. Godly thoughts are high, noble and perfect; flesh
ideas are horned in the lower reproductive system of man.
Divine thoughts are eternal reality while carnal thoughts are
low manifestations of a higher power which have transmuted
in the wrong direction.
The Doctrine The doctrine of transubstantiation as taught
of Trans- in Catholicism is false. The bread and wine
Substantiation in the communion could not transmute and
become the flesh and blood of Christ after one partakes of it.
It is merely a symbol of the transmuting of life's energies, but
ignorant theologians cannot distinguish between a symbol and
the reality. All of the literal views of the Bible are incorrect
speculations of mortal mind, only one with spiritual vision can
discern the Truth which is the reality, and distinguish it from
its symbol.
Parables Jesus often spoke in parables or symbols so
and the wise would receive the real meaning,
Symbols while the followers of dogmas would ·be
given only the wisdom of the outer form. One should not throw
pearls before swine or give holy things to the dogs (meaning
low minded) lest they turn and rend the one who befriends
them. Only those who live in spiritual life will ever know the
beauty and power of Super Mind Science, for it is not wise that
the insincere should receive the inner knowledge th,e same as those
who are sincere. Sin, sickness and death are the lot of those
who live on the carnal plane of unreality, they do not belong
to Divine Mind or to those who have renounced the outer forms
of religion and have found the inner science of Truth. The
lower nature stimulates the creations of Truth by calling atten-
tion to the wonders of a transitory and illusive world, which in
comparison with Infinite Mind is but the shadow picture of a
realm of reality, power, Truth, Love and Light. The soul of
man seeks to escape from the outer by reaching the inner. The
oneness of God disputes the permanence of the material uni-
verse, therefore, reality consists in the unchanging realm of
Truth.

The meaning of the Divine symbology is herein given to show
the reality as compared with its symbol.
FATHER, The Divine, All,pervading Infinite Spirit.
SON, The emanation of the Infinite called finite.
HOLY GHOST, The power of reproduction and regeneration.
The true emanation from the Infinite Spirit is the Christ which
represents Love, Truth and Life. This emanation can become
as the Infinite, thus overcoming the world, it is accomplished
by The Holy Ghost or regeneration. This process requires a
knowledge of Super Mind Science which demonstrates the
power that is used by the individual to regenerate one's self.
Mind All motion is due to mind, not matter, and
and no regeneration is possible without change.
Motion Change is motion, motion is mind, there,
fore generation or regeneration is entirely of mind. Mind ever
moves onward and upward, only matter and mortal retard
development, therefore become as mind continually changing
for the better.
CHAPTER VII
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND
"These are the statutes and judgements which
ye shall observe to .do in the land, which the
Lord God of thy, Father's giveth thee to possess
it all -the days that ye live upon the earth."
Supreme
Law
-DEUTERONOMY.
All life from the remotest insect to the
largest mammal is governed by the law and
order of Mind. All things are governed by
the supreme law of Infinite Spirit according to intelligence and
the laws of gender. The author herein sets forth the facts con-
cerning the supreme law and the lesser statutes of life, according .
to truth and fact as revealed in the study of the Scriptures and
Super Mind Science.
Laws The. positive state of mirid represents God
of manifesting as the supreme Infinite Father.
Gender This creative state of mind brings forth all
. life by its power of p~etration. Anyone who desires success
in life must learn to enter this state mentally so as to bring their
desires into reality. This state being the one and same as the
·Infinite spiritual state, is unlimited in its power to create. It
has unlimited power to create health, harmony and spiritual
wisdom because in this state mind controls the positive life cur-
rents which in turn control the law of life and birth. In additi~n
to controlling these positive life currents this state of mind can
overcome all negative conditions.
Violation Those who become negative mentally, vio-
of the late the positivE< law of mind. The negative
Law which represents illusion, disease and death
sets in motion decaying energies and powers which react on t~e
violator of the law of positive life. It causes them to be open
to germs, microbes and all manner of disease. These diseases
weaken the mental structure of the one who becomes negative,
producing hallucinations, illusions, uncertainty, lack of self con-
fidence, dishonesty, criminal ideas and all types of destructive
mental forces. These powers if allowed to rule, develop
spiritual negation, torment of the consciousness, and loss of
immortality through oblivion.
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 73
To Obey In order that one may avoid the penalty of
the disobeying the law of positive fatherhood
Law mind, it is ,well for them to know what they
must do to prevent that violation. In order to obey the law,
one must learn to concentrate the mind, control the life ener•
gies, overcome speaking evil or doing evil, study life as a positive
and negative manifestation, accept, the good things in life and
reject the practice of indulging. in destructive habits. Super
Mind Science teaches the proper way to generate life currents,
concent~ate the mind and attain perfect mental poise.
Evil Those who practice the following methods
Mental called "Mental Science" by undeveloped
Practice mortals are violating the positive laws of
mind and life. Repeating affirmations, such as "mortal mind is
evil", "matter is illusion'', "disease has no existence'', "I am
power supreme", "there is no truth nor substance in matter",
"God is all there is'', "I am pure and holy" before they have
learned the positive mental state and power are untrue, ~exag­
gerated formulas which reduce one's mentality to absolute nega•
tion, inducing falsehood, dishonesty, and lack of positive moral
principles. Many of the unfortunate mortals following these
systems "sit in the silence" and give selfish suggestions to some·
one's mind in order to attain personal gain.
Good Super Mind Science teaches the following
Mental methods which represent good mental prac•
Pra~ice tice. They are, concentration on becoming
pos.itive and creative mentally, healing ~he sick by silent thought
power or the laying on of hands, concentrating to help those
who desire it. It does not teach affirming that you are pe;rfect
until you have atta:ined perfection. Rule the body and do not
deny its existence because such denial makes the body negative
and opens it to forces of death and disease. Further, such
negative practices open the mind to obsessions and abnormal
hallucinations. Acknowledge all the good you see, and more
than that, all the good in the universe, seen and unseen for God
, is Good, Truth and Love.
Motherhood The receptive motherhood principle or state
Principle of mind was never intended to precede the
of Mind positive, and it serves a good purpose only
when ruled by the positive. Whe~ the mind concentrates in a
positive state, it controls the positive and negative energies and
74 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
regulates their flow. The visualization state which follows the
concentrated state is termed "the motherhood principle of mind".
Unless this state is preceded by the fatherhood or positive state,
no mental creation can take place, whereas, if it is so preceded a
certain demonstration can be assured.
Life
Jesus controlled the life energies and through
them healed the sick and raised the dead.
Energies
In Super Mind Science we have discovered
how these positive and negative life energies enter the Solar
Plexus, and thence travel to the brain, carrying with them every
thought which reaches the brain. When the mind is positive,
only thoughts which produce success and health reach the brain
through this channel. This fact explains the power of a positive
mentality to rule those who are negative and thus succeed in
great tasks, for the positive minded person is a manifestation of
the Infinite, Creative Spirit. When one is positive and yet
meek and expresses Universal Love, they are a manifestation of
the Christ Spirit.
Positive ·
Healers
Positive healers who are trained in the laws
of mind and life as in Super Mind Science,
express mentally and physically only the
positive constructive thoughts which create health in the patient.
They never express negation or the negative law previous to the
positive because this type of expression would do harm rather
than good. They :6.rst show the health seeker how to increase
the life energy, then the healer assists the sick who are negative
mentally to direct the positive life energy into the diseased part
of the body. This starts the expansion processes in operation,
then by the application of Divine power the body which was
negative becomes positive and healthy. Then like Jesus we say
"be it according to thy will".
Harmony Super Mind .Science brings about complete
in harmony between the positive and negative
Mental Laws laws of mind and life, proving that man can
control these Divine creative energies and prolong his life. The
student who keeps his body uncongested by daily generating
these energies will not have bqdy or mental poisons which con•
gest the passageways of energy and power. No one can be
successful in Mental Science without a knowledge of this law,
for it is the basis of all creation. The methods of complete
mental mastery of positive a.D.d negative life energy were discov•
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 75
ered by the author. As a result of this discovery thousands of
successful healing demonstrations have been performed in Super
Mind Science. God, being positive harmonizes with health,
which accounts for the positive type individual being healthy
and successful. Disease is negative and harmonizes with sin,
plainly showing the failure, sickness and premature death of
the negative type.
Lamb's Around the body there is an astral light, this
Book of light registers the impressions of deeds done
Life in the flesh. The negative deeds are con-
demned by the conscience as sin, while the positive represent
the good and are sanctioned by the conscience. This record is
the "Lamb's Book of Life". The negative deeds stand to con-
demn the life of the soul, because they are evil and do not con-
form to positive creative Divine law and heavenly harmony.
When the soul is called upon to view the record of these deeds
registered, it is called the "day of Judgment". If the positive
outweighs the negative, one rises to "eternal consciousness", if
the negative outweighs the positive, the result is oblivion.
N ature changes the form of all beings that
violate her immutable laws, which calls to
mind the judgment of the flesh "dust thou
art and to dust thou returneth". The law of life is the law of
Soul
Annihilation
Mind, for all life here and hereafter has its existence in Mind and
no temporal belief can change either the record of life or the
judgment of God. No amount of prayer can persuade nega-
tive to be positive, sin to become righteous or God to be evil.
Magnetic
Law
The law of magnetic attraction as taught in
Super Mind Science causes the mind to
vibrate in harmony with the magnetic pulsa-
tion which emanates from the sun. When positive control of
magnetism is demonstrated, one will observe that "like attracts
like", sinful thoughts attract sinful companions, thoughts of pov-
erty attract poverty, thoughts of weakness attract sickness. This
same law when understood can be operated in one's favor by
learning how to create the magnetic vibration through concen-
tration of the mind, and breath control as taught in Super Mind
Science. This law then begins to attract the things in life we
desire, such as health, harmony, happiness and spiritual power.
The magnetic impulse can be felt by any apt student in a few
moments after compliance with the law.
76 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Theory Theory is one thing, but practice is quite
and another. In Super Mind Science the life
Practice energy can be controlled and the student .can
feel it by mentally conforming to the laws and mental states.
No blind faith is required. The Science stands upon demon·
stration, not belief, for belief without positive demonstration to
prove its contention is negative in itself. Super Mind Science
demonstrates its teachings, while many systems give the student
speculation and theory only.
Positive
Sowing
The sowing of positive mental seeds by posi·
tive mental methods is sure to produce
results, for the law of sowing and reaping is
a reality and produces its results. Super Mind Science con•
forms to this law by providing the proper means for the student
to make the necessary mental effort to succeed. No amount of
negative affirmations can take the place of this law. Theoretical
disagreement with Super Mind Science will not alter the law of
reaping according to what one has sown mentally, physically and
spiritually. Theological speculation is no better than metaphysi·
cal speculation, it may sound more sacred to those unilluminated
.mortals but it cannot change the laws of mind. Those negative
souls who confess sin without trying to overcome sin are tying
mental millstones around their neck which will later draw them
under the tide in. the sea of life. Super Mind Science warns
them, but cannot change them unless they express a desire to
know the Truth, and learn the laws of mind and life and then
conform to them, for God is no respector of persons or religious
beliefs.
Law of Man possesses five physical senses, however
Sense all sense _perception is solely dependent on
Perception one sense, the sense of feeling. When feel•
ing is removed from any sense organ it becomes powerless to
function as an organ of correct perception. The feelings register
bliss when one thinks of God, and register disturbance when one
thinks evil or selfish thoughts. When the mind is correctly
trained all sense perception becomes spiritual which changes
one's outlook on life, revealing the Divine p·resence in every cell
of the body and the eternal reality of soul perception. Then

Those who do the "will of the heavenly Father" as Jesus expressed
it, obey the laws of His Kingdom. The laws consist of serving
humanity unselfishly, healing the sick and comforting those in

powers of life energies and conform to the laws of mind, has an
excellent opportunity to conform to these Divine laws.

Love and Light. This same law applies to those who eat flesh,
they are punished with body congestions and ailments all because
they violate the Divine laws. Likewise, those wh o commit

law of compensation metes out an exacting reward.

"as ye sow, so shall ye reap". Violation of the laws of good
behavior bring upon one the ridicule of those present besides
making them subject to the fines and punishment meted out by
the laws of man. There are other laws such as, hate begets
hate, and thousands of conditions and unlimited forces which
chastise man when he violates the laws of conduct. Those who
take even an obscure part in killing another, such as a vote for
death on a jury, set the laws of life against themselves, which
brings sorrow and premature death, for "those who kill with the
sword die by the sword". N o one can escape the penalty of. the
laws of life, or by a prayer to God cause them to be changed.

Mind and The laws of positive and negative mind
Universal force produce all the opposites, such as like
Love and dislike, pleasure and pain, evil and good,
low temperature and _
high temperature, anger and love, malice
and kindness, ignorance and wisdom. The positive controls all
the favorable sides of the opposites such as pleasure, good, love,
etc. The manifestations of the negative or misdirected mind
produce dislike, pain, evil, etc., however these principles exist
only in the absence of Good or God.
Jesus Jesus said "I came not to destroy the law
and the and the prophets, but to fulfill them", mean-
Law ing He was born as an example of complete
obedience to the laws of life. Through His strict obedience
"He overcame the world" and overcame death. The law has
never changed, it is the same today as it was then. It will be
the same forever, for perfection changeth not, therefore those
who obey the law now, can overcome disease, sin and death.
This is proven in Super Mind Science by the demonstrations
performed by students and "the healing of all manner of disease".
Mind Mind controls matter. This law is as

power. First, teach the mind that the Will is sovereign, then
overcome all weaknesses, sinful tendencies, earthly attachments
and uncertainties. Know that Infinite Spirit operates through
the Will of man, and that the Will of man when used for good
is a law unto itself. No law of mortal man can govern the acts
of the Will, it is subject only to the law of God. Jesus said
regarding the wonders He demonstrated, "it is not I that doeth
these things, but Hi~ who sent me".
Law Super Mind Science says regarding its won-
of ders, "it is not the Will of mortal man that
Science doeth these things, but it is the Will of God
working through man which performs these remarkable heal-
ings". As proof of the Divinity of this power, we offer testimony
that "the lame walk, the deaf hear, and the blind see". The Will
of mortal man in itself cannot perform such wonders, only the
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 79
Divine Will of Infinite Spirit can do so. The only accurate and
Divine Science is one which shows the methods of demonstrat-
ing this Infinite Will.
Laws All suffering comes from following the laws
of of matter and depending on them as reliable
Matter to solve the problems of life. Where mind
is not considered, the so-called laws of matter are so imperfect
they do not even alleviate suffering humanity. In most
instances, the laws of man which are supposed to be just, imprison
a man without money, but set those free who have the price to
deposit for security, therefore making it criminal for a man to
be poor. Man's law is based upon value from a material stand-
point, with the idea of revenge and punishment as a .means of
reforming weak minded mortals who think it is profitable to sin.
. Such concept shows the imperfect idea of law and order
entertained by materialists.
The Law The Law of Periodicity is, that all things
of temporal, which includes sectarian religion,
Periodicity have an appointed time to function. After
its period, it must give way to higher ideals and more exalted
Truth, therefore the churches which claim to be the outcome of
the ministry of Christ, yet endorse war and the killing of human
beings under the name of capital punishment, have about served
.their purpose. They must now step aside for a scientific religion
which teaches the presence of God in every human being, and
also teaches the sacredness of life of every creature, and the
training of the mentality to demonstrate Christianity in every
day life. Creedalism will be destroyed through violence and
possible bloodshed by those of their own rank, for those who
kill with the sword shall die by the sword.
Signs ':The signs of the times" indicate that even
of the in the most orthodox Christian countries the
Times intelligent people regard the Church as an
institution of moral and physical good, but having no spiritual
value, a political machine which favors the rich but ignores the
poor. What a spectacle there would be if Christ returned to
earth physically today! H ow far removed from His teachings
H e would :find His so-called ministers of spirituality sitting on
thrones, wearing crowns on their head! H e would scorn their
palaces of gold surrounded by soldiers with fixed bayonets who
guard the supposed "holy man" in order to keep his own sub-
80 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
jects from assassinating him. What an upheaval there would
be! How He would turn from these vicars who live in luxury
like a king, while millions of the poor contribute their earnings
to support them.
Law When the law of compensation begins to
of collect from these false teachers, woe be unto
Compensation t[,em, for they shall perish beneath the fire
of materialism, which they themselves kindled. They will be
killed by those whom they have not taught that it is a sin to kill
an enemy. They Will say '"we are persecuted", yes, because they
have persecuted the "saints of God" in the past, for "as a
man soweth, that shall he also reap". This law applies to church
organizations as well as to individuals-none are exempt from
this immutable law.
Condemn The modern Pharisees of orthodox belief
Christ condemn the Christ healing by the laying
Healing on of hands and directing power, just as the
Pharisees of old condemned the Master. They claim that drugs
and remedies are superior· to His way of healing. They teach
that although the teachings of Jesus are not practical to live by,
they are ideal to die by. We ask, that if Jesus was the Son of
God and had perfect wisdom, how could His healing be other
than the most perfect healing method? If His teachings can-
not stop pain, then by what power can they save a soul? Can
one lose their body through ignorance and sin, and yet save the
soul? These are the questions that should be answered by
those who oppose the establishment of Super Mind Science both
as a Science and a Religion.
Law of Those who oppose the re-establishment of
Cause the works of Christ in the church, claim that
and Effect His healing was for Himself and Disciples
alone, yet Jesus said "these works shall ye also do, and even
greater works shall ye do". He did not say "these works shall
my first disciples do, but no one else shall do them". The law
of cause and effect causes the premature death of millions of
victims of such teachings every year. Millions enter eternity
unprepared, lacking in the understanding of spiritual laws.
Law The law of Love is, that all sincere Christians
of must"'heal the sick and do good <leads, "be
Love up and care for the living, while the dead
bury the dead". Those who obey the law of Love become as
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 81
the Son of God, "the light of this world". Super Mind "ctence
stands firmly upon the laws of Spirit as demonstrated by Jesus,
it rejects all empty beliefs which do not demonstrate the powers.
One belief is as worthless as another as a means of salvation.
Anyone who can stop pain, heal themselves and others, and
perform other demonstrations taught by Jesus, we accept them
as brothers emulating the same Truth, fruit of the same vine.
Those who do the Divine works, the same are our brothers,
and we work hand in hand.
The Law The law of Mises which was supposed to
of have Divine origin, gave the commandment
Moses "Thou shalt not kill", yet a little later we
find the "Goel of Israel" very interested in war, advising how
an enemy should be captured and all his goods taken away from
him, and in some cases killing him. We notice that the Hebrews
actually believed God blessed them for killing Gentiles. Either
Moses had no Divine revelation or he communicated with a
righteous God one day and a Satanic God the next, for the
Infinite Universal Spirit of Love would not give such evil advice.
It would never contradict Divine orders. Because of this evil
aspect of the Law of Moses, Jesus came to fulfiill and end that
law, establishing in its stead the spiritual law of Love and Good-
ness. The only fault they could find with Jesus was His Divine
Goodness.
Truth Many adversaries of the truth of Super Mind
Ever Science have found the same fault with it.
the Same Even though their body was healed through
it, they deserted it and returned to their mental idols of weak-
ness, because of its teachings of goodness and its condemnation
of evil. Truth has ever been so received, for it is written "the
world loveth darkness", but the beatiful light shed upon mind
and Spirit in this Science will do away with much suffering.
Many have been and will continue to be touched with the heal-
ing power of Truth, which alone is sufficient compensation for
all the years of study on the part of the author, whose sole
desire is to redeem mankind from the wages of sin and error.
Laws Man's being is composed of mind or intelli-
of gence; body, a physical expression; soul, the
Being inner reality or being of righteousness.
When the inner self manifests, Divine demonstrations of power
take place which are condemned by the materialist who says as
82 · ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
he did of old, "crucify him", yet he calls himself equal with
God. Everywhere that the soul power comes forward, it is met
with opposition from those who dwell in darkness mentally.
However, the Law of Being is that Spirit will triumph, Truth will
down falsehood and power will overcome weakness.
Fall Dogmas and man made creeds cannot give
of one soul satisfaction, which has resulted in
Dogmas millions seeking Truth outside of the
churches. Materialistic creeds made by councils of politicians
who robbed Christianity of its greatest power, that of Christ
healing have now begun to wane. No amount of financial aid
can save them, because they removed the most beautiful jewel
in the spiritual crown of "Jesus, the Christ", namely the effi-
ciency of His healing art. They delivered the sick unto the
hands of materialist systems which completely ignore mind, God
and Truth as a healing power.
Laws Science consists of facts which are provable.
of If Christianity can be demonstrated, it is a
Science Science, if it cannot be demonstrated, it is
a myth. If Super Mind Science which is based on the truth of
Christianity is wrong, then Christianity could not be scientific
or true. Some may say why call it Super Mind Science? The
author answers that there are other lower or negative "Mind
Science" systems which are directly opposite to this Science,
therefore we explain, "Super" means higher, above, beyond.
This is the truth of what Super Mind Science actually is, it
is a much higher Science than any of those lesser Sciences which
the public is wont to compare it with. It gives instructions in
Truth, above and beyond any of the other sciences, our methods
are positive and creative where theirs are efficient only when
used by negative people.
Healing Super Mind Science heals those who do not
Without believe in it equally as well as those who
Belief believe in it. A disbeliever in our Science,
an atheist, believer or follower in any other sect or creed, if
he uses our method will be healed, because Science does not
depend on belief. W e consider those disbelievers with occult
ideas the same as those who follow different ideas and creeds,
for anyone can see even with material reasoning the logic of
Super Mind Science, which fu!ches that disease is but conges-
tion, and expansion which is ease is mental first and physical
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 83
last. Super Mind Science having the best expanding process,
also the most perfect concentration method, heals the quickest.
Science of If all children were trained in Divine Mind
Mind Science there would be no morons or imbe-
Needed ciles. If every church taught a class in the
keys of Super Mind Science as taught by the founder, there
would be little use for hospitals, prisons or institutions for "fee-
ble minded". The idea that the church should not teach scien-
tific Truth is the greatest error of this age, for the church which
does not mold character is doomed to failure. Only the institu-
tions which attempt to save the entire man, and teach all of
Christ's work can endure in the future. Super Mind Science,
being scientific and logical meets that requirement.
Untruthful
Teachings
When the young people are taught that God
sends suffering upon them, they are taught
falsely. Only ignorance of the laws of life
cause man to sin, which brings upon him the results of sins of
omission and commission. What use is it to teach the young
generation about the miracles of the past and deny the miracles
of the present? The young say, "if God did wonders then, why
can He not do them now, why should the world be left in dark-
ness now"? Such teachings which imply that the laws of God
ch;rnge and that once He condoned healing and other wonders,
but now turns a deaf ear to suffering humanity are untrue and
will go down to destruction.
Physical
Reality
Those who attach such great importance to
the physical virgin birth of Jesus regarding
His body as being the real Jesus should be
more concerned about His glorious life and works. They should
learn the scientific Truth that matter can never be the father of
a soul, only God is the Father of all souls. Spiritually we are
all "Sons of God" made in His image, or in His spiritual like-
ness. All Masters of the physical nature discover that they can
leave the body and also return to it at Will, therefore the body
is not the real being at all, but is only a means to an end. True
Divine Mind Scientists control their body, treat it well, then
when they have attained spiritual wisdom, they will cast it aside
as they would an old cloak. Those who master Super Mind
Science will be able to perform this demonstration, for when
mind is master, the flesh must obey.
84 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Human When the truth regarding the Fatherhood
Will of God, not only in the case of Jesus, but
Divine of every human soul is understood, then
people will grasp the meaning of the saying of Jesus."ye are also
sons of God". Then will human Will be understood as Divine
Will, Truth as the power back of Will or the Will of God, and
Science, the truth · about being. Then also \}'ill the truth be
revealed about mental quackery which denies that human Will
is Divine, for can the soul- which was created by Almighty God
be ruled by human Will, or, how could there be other than
Divine Will? The power that kills which seems to some to be
the Will is simply the absence of Divine Will, a false force which
exists only because of the absence of good or Divine Will. Evil
has no power, it is negation, good alone has power.
Animal
Magnetism
There is no such thing as "animal magnet-
ism as an "evil power", for God
does not create powers opposite to His
Divine principles. Animal magnetism as evil is but mental delusion
believed in by those unilluminated mortals who want an excuse
for doing evil, like the orthodox Christian lays his faults at the
feet of satan. Such mental crutches are only an excuse for
mental weakness, for can a Son of God, a soul, possess an evil
power common to animals? The answer is "no". All mag-
netism is good, otherwise God would not, nor could not be its
creator. Super Mind Science receives all such negative beliefs
as mortal hallucinations, false concept, and the absence of good.
Mental
Devils
With the passing of beliefs in devils that
carry pitchforks comes the teachings of
others that are just as bad. Teachings that
consist of "animal magnetism", teachings that deny mortal
existence, teachings that one does not need to improve them-
selves while here, but need only to wait until they reincarnate
seven times before they attain wisdom. Systems that teach of
the return of dead spirits to guide one, teachings of "black
magic" or using the mind for evil; different types of teachings
that attempt to hide under the name of "Occultist" or "Truth"
teachings that evil spirits follow them or that some one is work-
ing evil powers on them, etc. All of these theories show the
mental weakness and lack of mastership of the founders of the
system who should have discovered that there are no evil
powers. Eivl manifests only in the absence of good, and when
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 85
one is shrouded in good no evil can harm them. Destruction
comes from failure to do good, more than from doing evil.
Wisdom To attain wisdom is the greatest accom-
Is plishment and only lasting gift of this life.
Priceless We read in the Proverbs the ancient saying,
"For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may
be desired are not to be compared to it". Wisdom comes from
understanding the mental values of life. Physical · knowledge
is good and has its values, but wisdom is priceless. Super Mind
Science ov~rcomes the materialistic view of life and brings into
operation the spiritual, in this manner wisdom is acquired by all
who adhere to its principles. Wisdom is a law unto itself, it
has no part in foolish speculation or the vague beliefs of mortal
man.
Wise
Men
Wise men say only what to. them is knowl-
edge or what they definitely know, but the
foolish person wastes his time telling others
his beliefs and disbeliefs. These uncontrolled minds and tongues
many times disturb and confuse those seeking wisdom because
of the untruths they state. A wise man says, "I know" when
he speaks, a foolish man says, "I believe"; "by these signs ye
shall know them". "A good tree bringeth forth good fruit,
while a corrupt tree bringeth forth corrupt fruit", for wisdom
is Law Divine, likened unto the Infinite Spiritual Intelligence.
Keeping
Instruction
It is written, "He is in the way of life that
keepeth instruction, but he that refuseth
reproof erreth", which is a true law. When
one belives they are perfect and wise, arrogance and sin become
a part of their mental delusion. The wisdom of Solomon says
"Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness deliv-
erth from death, The Lord will not suffer the soul of the right-
eous to famish". This is indeed the promise of Truth and wis-
dom, for health and prosperity come from obeying the Divine
laws of Life and Being.
Self
They way of a fool seems righteous to him,
nevertheless he comes under the lash of the
Justification
law. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, for
knowledge is available to all. Ignorance is a sin of omission or
commission and those who say "I do not understand Mind
Science, therefore I will not be punished for violating the laws
of mind" err in their judgment for every day thousands die
86 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
because they are ignorant of the laws of life, they violate the
law of wisdom and must suffer the consequences.
Results of Deceit and evil negation cause one to
Mental imagine evil, this is the first violation of
Error mental laws. The effect of this violation is
that when once the evil has been imagined, it is soon accom-
plished. Although the cause was imaginery or purely mental,
the effect is physical, therefore the cause being mental, all evil
is of the carnal mind. Man punishes the body for what the
mental faculty commits instead of correcting the cause. One
who is merciful to others recognizes the mental weakness of
his fellowman, but the cruel at heart are evil minded and are
doomed to destruction through the law of compensation.
Truth Truth is eternal while lies are temporal,
Is therefore; no lie will.destroy this Science, for
Eternal it is built on the solid rock of Truth, Love
and Light. That wh1ch is Truth is eternal goodness, as perma-
nent as God, and more accurate than time. Let every Super
Mind Scientist take refuge in the eternal principle of Truth,
and keep an open mind to Truth.
Preserving The righteous shall inherit the earth, but
the the wicked shall be consumed by the fire of
Righteous their own passion and lust. All good things
can be enjoyed by those who control their thoughts, bear up
under persecution, and yet exhibit the Godly qualities of Truth
and Love. "The light of the righteous shall be bright, but the
light of the wicked shall be put out", or their sinful identity lost,
for the laws of the Divine kingdom preserve only the good.
Words
of
The lips of the wise speak Truth, but the
heart of the wicked refuseth to hear until
Truth suffering causes them to harken. Some learn
by study, and others through misery and suffering. The wise
student learns and avoids trouble while one slow to learn is also
slow to be rescued from the consequences of their folly. Many
come to Super Mind Science only to overcome certain suffering,
then when they are relieved they return again to the f<?ld of sin
and ignorance. Their state in the last instance is worse than
in the first.
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 87
The doctrine of "eternal consciousness" and
the method of attaining it is the most
Consciousness
important philosophy in Super Mind Sci-
Eternal
ence. Paul says, "For we know that if our earthly house of
this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens". To attain
to this full knowledge of heavenly things while we yet live on
earth is indeed important. Super Mind Science in the teachings
of "the door of the soul" which leads to "eternal consciousness"
offers a method of attaining this wonderful knowledge.
Unreality In death there is no reality, for life is in
of mind. Paul instructing the Corinthians says,
Death "Always bearing about in the body the
dying of the Lord, Jesus, that the life ·also of Jesus might be
made manifest in our body". The meaning of this is that we
should be spiritually conscious in our body knowing that we
have an inner body which is not subject to death. Super Mind
Science demonstrates the actual existence of this body which is
not subject to death.
Stress the So many assert their belief in the death and
Life of resurrection of Jesus, yet they do not notice
Jesus His beautiful life or endeavor to live accord-
ing to His teachings. When one attains to correct knowledge
of Mind Science they will be able to see the necessity of know-
ing rather than believing. The facts concerning life is an attrac-
tive study, but the superstitious beliefs regarding life is a dead
study which leads to death. If all churches would teach people
how to live and how to think instead of what to think and how
to die, they would be more successful and their members more
happy.
Knowing
,While
The Scripture for the doctrine that one may
know the immortal life while on earth is "I
Living knew a man in Christ above fourteen years
ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the
body, I cannot tell: God knoweth): such an one caught up
to the third heaven". (2 Corinthians 12:2). This teaching
places the approval of Christ upon the practice of leaving the
body at will. The author has had this experience countless
times since the Immortal Life Divine was revealed to him.
88 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Persecution The persecution which Mental Science has
of endured is great proof of its Divine mission.
Mental Science Why religions oppose mind control yet
expect people to cease sinning is a mystery, for the most posi-
tive person fails to be able to follow the teachings of Christ
without a study of mind control. Even Christ required the
fast and solitude of the wilderness in order to follow the doc-
trine which H e preached. The power of the Infinite Spirit is
strong and lifts up those whose consciousness is spiritual and
whose ideals are exalted above the flesh. Those who persecute
Mental Science will receive the reward of the flesh, which is
disease and death.
Law The great law of Christ is to "bear ye one
of another's burdens" which means, heal the
Christ sick, restore sight to the blind, hearing to
the deaf, and teach the Truth to the poor. It means being will-
ing to fulfiill the law by demonstrations of Divine power, fol-
lowing in the footsteps of Truth, Love and Light. The laws
of mind are the laws of life, therefore no one can understand
life unless they study and understand the mind.
Christ When the Master was on earth He continu-
a ally preached against the formal ceremonies
· Mystic and ritualism of the Jews. The killing of
innocent lambs to appease a supposed angry God was repug-
nant to Him, for what God of Love would require the blood of
an innocent creature in order to buy His favor? Jesus called
these Pharisees and hypocrites who believed in outer cere-
monies "whi'.ted sepulchres, white without but corrupt within".
How little did He think that two thousand years later a so-c~lled
Christian Church would compare Him with a slaughtered lamb
who had to be killed in order to satisfy a God who demanded
His innocent blood as a remission of the sins of the world. God
would have to be a vicious demon to demand such an unrea-
sonable price for His favor. Christ's victory over death was
the important demonstration to be considered, not the advantage
gained by willful sinners through His death.
The Wise The title of "the wise men" conferred on
Men of the Mystics of the Orient by translators of
the East . the N ew T estament is indeed a fitting title.
They were wise in their knowledge of the "secret doctrine of
the East" which was advanced Mental Science of that time,
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 89
however their true title was "Magi". According to the original
Greek version, Magi means one who performs seeming wonders
or miracles through forces generally unknown or occult. These
Wise Men having a full understanding of the importance of the
birth of the Christ child came seeking Him to welcome Him
to this earth. While the Christian Church may desire to con,
ceal their personalities, it is well known in India, Persia and
Egypt that they were Mystic Astrologers, Mental Scientists and
Adepts.
Matthew's
Record
The record attributed to Matthew concern,
ing the birth of Jesus was explicit in saying
they were Magi. However, the English
translators changed this term to "Wise Men" because they hated
mysticism and did not want it associated with the birth of Jesus
Christ, for the word Magi has always been accepted as mean,
ing "wonder worker". The birth of the Master was expected
by the Masters of Eastern Spiritual wisdom, but was unknown
to the orthodox Jews. This plainly shows which school of
thought Jesus belonged to, for He became the greatest of all
Magi, or wonder workers.
His
Star
The Wise Men announced "they were
searching for Him because they had seen
His star in the East". Now the star referred
to was the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the constellation
of Pisces which was later joined by Mars in the year 748. Kep,
ler's records of astronomy calculated in the year of 1604 and
since verified, shows this to be a fact. This conjunction was
first calculated to be seven years before the birth of Christ, but
later was found that the correct date was the year of His birth.
When this conjunction appeared, there was a star formed from
the stars in the heavens, a "star of stars" making a six pointed
star or the symbol of the Master. The Wise Men knew because
of this great star formation that the "Master of Masters" had
been born.
Astrology The sign of Pisces in Occult Astrology
of which is practically unknown to the western
Judah world was the star of Judah, therefore the
Wise Men observed that the Master was to be born in Judah
or near there. Knowing this, they began a journey which
required a year to reach Bethlehem, reaching there shortly after
the birth of Jesus. The orthodox idea of a traveling star is
90 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
unfounded, it is an unscientific invention, like many other of
their theories. This star of Judah was observed only by trained
Masters of the astrological lore of India and Egypt. The star,
being an emblem of the Great White Lodge of Adepts, was
continually before them mentally until they found "Jesus, the
babe".
Denial The Christian church has denied the value
of of Oriental Astrology and classed it as base
Astrology superstition. They deny the association. of
astrologers with the birth of Jesus. Super Mind Science teaches
that there is a true astrology, but also realizes that the system
now in use in the western world is not the geunine, it is but a
fragment of the original spiritual system.
Proof The author offers as material proof of his
of contention that the Wise Men were astrolo-
Assertion gers, the comment of the New International
Encyclopedia, which is a standard educational work. It states
that "some early Christians accepted astrology while many
rejected it", it also states that "the Wise Men were Chaldean
Magi or astrologers". The church has never successfully dis-
proved this teaching or disputed the Standard Encyclopedias
which all seem to agree on this point.
Eastern The author who traveled in the Far East
Brotherhoods learned many wonderful facts concerning
of Masters Life and Being from the Brotherhoods of
Adepts and Eastern Ascetics. He learned much of the unknown
life of Jesus not recorded in the New Testament, some of which
he gives in this work in order to throw light on the true life of
Jesus. The Masters of the Far East never dispute Jesus, but
teach that all who believe in Him must do His works and in
doing so become like Him. They teach His glorious iife as an
example for all to follow, they do not teach His death as a
means of excusing those who sin against the laws of N ature.
Version The Jews expected a Messiah to be born in
of Bethlehem who was supposed to be a war-
Jews rior king and would bring back the glory of
Judah. However, the "king of peace" expected by the Masters
of the East was to be a spiritual Master, their prophecy was
written in the stars and was fulfilled. This proves Jesus to have
LAWS OF LIFE AND MIND 91
been the Master expected by the Brotherhood of Mystic Adepts.
The offerings of gold, symbol of the mind; frankincense, symbol
of the soul purified by Divine Godly union; myrrh, symbol of the
body, which were given to the babe by the Wise Men further
proves the truth of Jesus being welcomed symbolically as a great
spiritual Master.
.Wise Men As soon as the Wise Men inquired for the
Guided "Great Master" the Jews thought they
in Dream meant the "King of the Jews" which the
prophets of Israel had foretold. They began to look diligently
for the supposed "new born King" which aroused the jealousy
of Herod who planned the death of the child through a ruse
worked to fool the Wise Men. However, while asleep, know-
ing as they did, the art of leaving the body, they were told in a
so-called "dream" of the evil intentions of Herod. This is mind
reading on the Astral Plane and is the same as is demonstrated in
the method of the door of the soul in Super Mind Science. This
art was communicated to the author by a Magi.
Watch After the visit of the Magi, the Brotherhood
Over sent other travelers who occasionally met
Jesus the Christ child and instructed Him in the
Eastern lore of mysticism. They knew that He was a pure soul
who had never lived in a body before, a direct incarnation of
God Spirit, and therefore was destined to raise the dead and
overcome death. While Jesus was growing up He was many
times instructed by "strange travelers" who came to Nazareth
where He made His home. When He was thirteen years old
He had been schooled in the Hebrew mysticism by Jewish
teachers and also in the occult mysteries of India, Persia and
Arabia.
Feast The feast of the Passover which occurred in
of the April was one of the most sacred ceremonies
Passover of Judahism. It was in remembrance of
the angel of death which swept over all of Egypt's land smit-
ing the first born child of all the Egyptians, but sparing the
homes of the children of Israel who had marked their houses
with sacrificcial blood, so the angel would not make a mistake
and kill their children. Jesus had just entered His thirteenth
year and was to attend the Passover where for the first time He
could sit at the feast table with the Elders of Israel.
92 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
Jesus At the Temple were assembled all of the
at the great Mystic Adepts of Judahism who were
Temple expert Kabalist or workers of prophecies
through the science of numbers. While Joseph and Mary were
saying their prayers Jesus searched out these great Seers, for
His interest was in wisdom, not in orthodox ceremonies. Soon
He found them discussing Hebrew mysteries, and became so
interested that He forgot His father, Joseph, and His mother,
Mary, who had attended the Passover with Him. Jesus was dis-
gusted with the sight of blood from the slaying of innocent
lambs who had been sacrificed in order to appease an unusual
. God therefore, He engaged in an argument with the Doctors of
Theology against blood sacrifice, using the teachings of the
travelers from the East as a basis for His argument.
Jesus
Lost
The parents of Jesus were so occupied with
the events of the Passover that they had
forgotten about Him until they were ready
to leave, when they were informed by pilgrims that He had
preceded them. They began their return journey home, but
found after a two day journey that the boy had not preceded
them. Quite anxious, they arose early one morning and
returned to Jerusalem where they searched for two days in the
Temple Courtyard. Finally they discovered Jesus teaching the
laws of life to men who were aged Philosophers, and they were
listening to Him, astonished at His sayings.
Expressing Jesus expounded truths of the mystic
Higher teachings of India, also the wisdom religion,
Mental Science or higher Mental Science, teaching the
sacredness of life and the law of Love. All were astounded at
the wisdom of the child. When His teaching ended, His mother
reproached Him saying, "we were distressed about you". Then
Jesus answered "why sought ye me", saying "know ye not that
I must be in my Father's house, about my Father's business".
This was the birth of the great mastership of Jesus. From this
point until Jesus reaches thirty years of age the New Testament
is silent about His life, however, the Occult lore of the Mystic
Orient begins where it leaves off.
Magi Following the incident at the Passover a
Sent to Magi appeared in Nazareth on a mission from
Bring Jesus the Brotherhood. His mission was to per-
suade the parents of Jesus to let Him go with the Magi to India

to a Himalaya mountain religious retreat where He would be
prepared for His Divine mission to the world. This they con-
sented to, and Jesus left with the Magi to enter a school of the
"Secret Doctrine" of the Wise Men of the Far East.
Travels H e remained with this Magi for three years.
m After this, desiring to travel and meet great
Orient Saints, H e began to be a wanderer. H e wan-
dered through India, Egypt and Persia, denouncing the rich and
befriending the poor. He meditated and came into great power
spiritually. H e was ordered to leave some cities because H e de-
nounced the priests and kings; H e was regarded as a radical, a
socialist, a disturber of customs.
Religious
Renegade
H e was known in many places as a "religious
renegade" who challenged all authority, and
hated the holy priest-craft. However, this
opposition was mild in comparison to what awaited Him when
H e returned to Judah where as a "born Rabbi" H e was to try to
overthrow blood sacrifice and Judah 's hypocrisy. He little
dreamed that death awaited Him for interfering with the priest-
craft business of Judah.
Returns When Jesus had visited all of the great
to religious retreats of India, Persia and Egypt,
Judah H e decided to return to His homeland.
About one year before His baptism by John H e returned to
Judah and spent all of His time with the mystic Brotherhood of
the Essenees. H ere H e met His cousin, later known as "John,
the Baptist" who was studying the mystic arts of that Brother-
hood. Jesus was recognized by the Masters of the Order as
"The coming Messiah", and they ordered John, the Baptist, to
go and prepare the "way for the Master". This he did by
preaching "repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand",
"The Master cometh", etc.
Jesus
Baptized
One day while John was preaching, Jesus
appeared suddenly without previous warning
and asked to be baptized by John, for H e
felt that since H e had been taught and helped by the greatest
Saints H e should demonstrate the spirt of humility which was
one of their teachings. John at first refused to baptize Him on
the grounds that H e was so much more spiritually advanced
than he (John) was.
94 ETERNAL WISDOM AND HEALTH
John
Consents
John finally consented, however, and bap-
tized Jesus, then followed the voice from
heaven pronouncing Jesus "The Son of God
in whom H e is well pleased". Jesus was startled by this un-
expected demonstration of power and later decided to find out
its true meaning. After meditation He decided to go down in
the wilderness, where alone with God H e could fast, pray and
concentrate His mind until His soul received the revelation of
His future mission which the M agi had told Him about many
times. So began the forty-day fast which proved His mastership
and gave Him His Divine revelation. In this revelation the
prophecy of His death, His raising from the dead and ascension,
the betrayals of Judas and Peter passed before him like a pano-
ramic view. As the mental picture of these events flashed before
His mind, H e was tempted but overcame the tempter.
Begins
Ministry
After H is trials were over He began His
ministry performing wonders as all Master
Magi do, healing the sick and curing mental
obsessions, using the Secret Doctrine of the East. While per-
forming these wonders H e selected His students, establishing
centers of instruction and founding a Brotherhood of disciples,
preparing to be killed by those priests whose business H e injured
through H is teachings. The church-minded orthodox may say ·
that there is no proof of this mystic life of Jesus. The author
would remind them of the thousands of changes in the transla-
tion of the Bible, the rejection of hundreds of pages of doctrine
as unfit to be a part of the Bible, which included also a book
said to be written by Jesus, Himself. Much of the writings
attributed to Matthew were also rejected. While this doctrine
of Jesus is not in the N ew T estament, sufficient proof of it can
be found by a close observer. The rest is legend as known in
the Brotherhood Schools where the author received his Spritual
enlightenment.
From The Jews thought that after their political
Death influences had killed Jesus by framing His
Unto Life death, that the end of His teachings would
soon come, but they misjudged His power, for H e passed from
"death unto life". His plans were so well laid that His death
remains as the greatest curse to Judahism, and because of it the
Jewish religion has suffered much, and the Jewish people more.
Not only did H is death ·encourage H is doctrines, but it gave Him

the opportunity to overcome de~th with spirituality and prove
a doctrine for superior to the Law of Moses. The Brotherhood
of Adepts where the Magi came from was the place where the
author also studied Mind Science previous to the founding of
Super Mind Science. Let each Super Mind Scientist be true to
the teachings of Christ and great will be the success of this
reinstatement of the True Christianity. All other views of
Christianity fail to account for its demonstrations of power.
Missing
Testimony
The New T estament is not only silent re-
garding nearly eighteen years of the life of
Jesus, the Christ, but many of its statements
fail to harmonize. Some of those are in giving the genealogy of
our Lord, Jesus Christ. From David, they show Him to be the
son of Joseph, providing one counts Christ as the fourteenth
generation from David. Matthew speaks of Jesus as "the son of
the Holy Ghost", Luke speaks of the visit of the Angel, Gabriel,
to inform Mary of her conception. Mark and John begin writing
the gospel with the events which happened in the time of the
young manhood of Jesus, disregarding His birth in their ac-
counts. The N ew T estament also relates that there are many
things concerning Jesus not recorded in the books thereof. The
author hopes he has thrown light upon those things which the
Divine Will has destined should be made known at this time.
The
Truth
The Truth is more wonderful than fiction,
it reveals the causes and effects. Super Mind
Science desires only to redeem mankind
through Truth, it does not wish to be a critic. Its methods of
controlling life energy enable everyone to demonstrate Christ-
ianity. The life currents of Super Mind Science are the same
powers used by Jesus to raise the dead and heal the sick. The
author studied them while traveling in India, Egypt and Arabia
in the same surroundings where Jesus became a Master. While
there he witnessed a M agi drink three glasses of deadly poison,
fulfilling the prophecy "and if they drink any deadly thing, it
shall not hurt them". The prophets of the Far East appeared to
the author from behind stone walls and talked to him, and fore-
told how Super Mind Science would re-establish the pure un-
defiled "Christianity". This prophecy is now being fulfilled. May
the blessings of Infinite Spirit rest upon every true Super Mind
Scientist and may their works continue to glorify "Our Father
who art in heaven".
