Many years after this my son asked me accidentally about a question and I began to remember about that experience. I called my mother on the telephone and asked her about what happened to me during the surgical intervention. She was astonished because she didn't speak to me a word about what happened during surgical intervention.

I didn't see my body, I was in a world filled of light, peace, love and knowledge. There were beings surrounding me with clear and warm light. They spoke with my mind and I understood all. Then a voice at my shoulders said that I must return in my body.  I said, 'That's not my right place.' Suddenly, I fell in a black hole and I was in the prison of my body.
