I remember the intense feeling I get when I lose consciousness (pressure in the chest and head). Then it was black. After that, I saw myself being lost in a kind of dark-brown cave; I was dressed in a white long-sleeve dress (very old-fashioned). There were about five doors or exits in this cave - three ahead of me and two behind me. A male voice was telling me to choose either one of the three doors in front of me, and that I should definitely not take one of the two other doors. After following his advice I started gaining consciousness; I also started to hear my mother talking to the paramedics.


The feelings I had afterwards were astonishment and confusion; I didn't know whether I was alive or dead.
