Suddenly, my consciousness was ripped from my body. I was hurled through a corridor-like tunnel that I could see through. Outside were thousands of planets that I passed at a tremendous speed. At the end of the tunnel, was a pinpoint of light that was growing larger and larger. My emotional state was that I was experiencing a very relaxed and loving feeling; in fact, I felt like I was a Prince coming home. However, I was also furious at being there. A pleasant and loving voice within the light asked me a question: 'Are you ready to come home?' To which I replied, 'No! I want to see my new son grow up.' I was immediately slammed back into my body. It was like every cell of my body was being pushed through a board, and yet I felt no real pain.

When I regained awareness, I was on my way to the emergency ward. Now thirty-seven years later, every time the medical people run an electrocardiogram they always say, 'Are you aware of having had a heart attack sometime in the past?' I always simply answer, 'Yes,' but say no more.
