  		              		Experience Description   

    Three of my friends and I had been coming home from a friend's house around 2:30 in the morning. We lived 45 minutes away and drove on the highway. The driver was speeding at the time, going roughly 130-140kmh. We were rounding a corner when the driver took his eyes off the road and reached down to grab a music CD. We started drifting past the shoulder and into the ditch. I yelled for him to look up, which he did. But he over-corrected when turning right. We went back onto the road and then swerved left and started to flip into the ditch. I remember hitting my face on the back, left passenger window where I was sitting and then I went unconscious. The truck had flipped  3 times and landed on the roof in 3 feet of water. The ditches were full at the time from the spring water runoff. The truck was submerged. 

  I remember opening my eyes under water but I wasn't choking, drowning or scared. I distinctly remember my mouth being half-open. I was lying on my back looking up but I couldn't feel any ground beneath me. It felt like I was floating. I had my arms to my sides and my legs slightly raised. I could see a light through the water illuminating me. I looked around and there was nothing but darkness and a brown/grey color from the light illuminating the water. It felt like I was floating in the ocean with nothing around for as far as I could see. I looked up again and then looked to my left. I saw myself floating while illuminated by that light. I wasn't scared, but was strangely calm.  I was not in any pain. I wanted to move closer to the light because it was fascinating me but I couldn't move. I remember blinking and suddenly I felt something grab the front of my shirt and pull me up fast.  It was like the feeling you get when an airplane takes off, it was a sudden jolt. 

  The next thing I remember is rushing out of the water in the truck in a sit up position. I was the only one awake and conscious. I remember feeling confused and not knowing where I was or what had happened. I started choking up water and then the pain hit me. The friend who was sitting in the back with me woke up and climbed out of the truck. I had been the only one submerged. I slowly climbed through the back passenger window and crawled to the ditch and sat there. I remember the shock setting in and the cold starting to hit my body. I was soaking wet in -8 degree weather and wearing  only a thin sweater. My other friends, by that time, had climbed out and hailed down a passerby. I was helped to a flat dry spot in the ditch and covered up with jackets. Hypothermia started to set in after 15 minutes, and I started counting my heartbeat to keep myself awake and conscious enough for when the paramedics arrived. 

  I lost consciousness on the way to the hospital and when they were working on me in the hospital. I spent 2 weeks in hospital with head trauma, a shattered left cheek bone, broken ribs, internal bruising and hypothermia. My other friends, thankfully, walked away with only scrapes and bruises. Comparing notes with my friends a few months later, I told them what I had seen and was laughing that at least the cab light in the truck still worked so I could see. I wanted to know  who had pulled me out of the water because I owed them dinner. They looked at me oddly and said the truck was upside down,  no lights were on, and that none of them had pulled me up. I have always been confused about what happened, but chalked it up to my brain firing neurons off and being at a heightened sense of consciousness.

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes.     It sounds super ridiculous, but I have issues with hauntings. I've had to move twice and my family has had to deal with things when they are around me also. I thought I was going crazy but when things started happening to my family members I lived with at the time it was a slight sense of relief. We enlisted different people to help with the situations and every time it came down to attraction to me. They explained it as 'imagine you're in a crowded room and no on can see or hear you, then someone walks in and that one person is the only one that can, so you automatically go to them' It still makes me laugh because the whole scenario is unbelievable.  
  
Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The ocean, I was the only person in it.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Shared with friends and family  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real.      I know what I seen and felt, but I want to understand the science behind it.  
  
What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably not real        

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No
