  		              		Experience Description   

    On January 12, 2019, my husband and I were travelling to a destination in the next state via a major highway. There was freezing temperatures and the roads, while wet, were not terribly slick. We did notice that all of the semi-truck drivers were travelling about 20 mph faster than we were in our car. I was thinking as we neared the next highway exit to ask my spouse to turn around and go back home. 
  
  Here is the physical  account of what happened:
  
  Just as I was opening my mouth to tell my husband to turn around and go home,  a car hit us hard from behind. Our car hurled forward and to the right, almost off the highway and into a ditch. I watched the side of the road as we lost some control of the car, contemplating how bad this accident would be. Finally my husband regained control, but the car turned to the left and back onto the highway  into traffic.   BAM! We were hit again by a semi-truck. The very same it seemed that hit us a moment ago. This time the impact was to the driver's side-door. Now we were gazing at the front grill of a white freight-liner semi-truck.  The driver was not stopping. It seemed like the driver  was not respnding to our honk or the noise of the crash. I was scared and  my husband panicked. I reached over him and desperately honked the horn  to alert the driver of the truck. The truck still  wouldn't stop. After being pushed a mile, we felt sure we were going to die. 
  
  It turns out that we were not exactly center of the trucks grill when it t-boned our car. The thing to stop the driver from pushing us on and on was the driver. My husband hit the brakes in an attempt to release or car from this semi and it worked. The car spun out 180 degrees into traffic and we watched the entire side of this truck closely pass our car. Then we ended up under the back semi-truck tire. We had been  run over by the wheel of a semi-truck! 
  
  Here is the psychological, emotional, and spiritual account from the passenger (me): 
  
  After the initial impact, I  was worrying about  how bad is this going to be and what was going to happen to us.    Then the accident escalated when we were stuck and pushed by a very unaware driver of the semi-truck. When I fully realized that there was likely a low chance of surviving, my mind was going through checks. I was saying goodbye to my mother and my family. I thought about how they would cope with me gone. Would my son be taken care of? I assesed everything and accepted my fate. I thanked everyone in my life for sharing their experiences and time with me. I realized there was nothing I could do, so  I  accepted whatever I couldn't control. In effect, I seperated myself from my attachments on earth.
  
  My husband is a great driver and a logical thinker under pressure. We broke free of the truck!  But, just as quickly as the flame of hope came, it was quenched. We saw the truck and I watched in slow-motion as our car passed under the truck. It was like watching  the film frame of a movie. We were undoubtedly going to die. I felt myself, my consciousness  sink into my body. It was like all sight and awareness was narrowing to a colorless pinhole. 

  Then, I was in a place that was no longer entirely dark. I was aware of this space that looked a lot like a NASA image of a galaxy. It looked like a white light with the spectrum of colors vibrating from it. I understood this as 'Source,' whish was a conscious knowing source. Starlights orbited around in this space in a logical pattern from the larger white-light source. I was there and made of  conscious light. There were many other conscious stars, but a few of them inteacted with me.   I remember communicating that this place was incredible. One of the  light Beings responded, 'Yes, this is home. This is consciousness. This is source.' There was some back and forth about the meaning of being on the earthly plane, interraction with others, and the memories and energies we leave behind. I felt immensely at peace and knew that love was the most important thing in this place. I felt like I had interacted with at least one of these conscious lights before. As I try to make sense of what was communicated to me, I understand that I should be operating here on earth to the best of my abilities, with understanding and love.

   I know  that all energy remains and is not extinguished. I know that parts of our consiouness have been on journeys we have experienced before. All these things flooded my consciousness and I had understanding in an instant. There was no linear time. Since this happened only weeks ago, I am sorting out what I've learned and it is a bit challanging. There were three main conscious Beings who interacted with me. One Being  seemed to be more experienced than the others and seemed to have more concern about communications with me and helping me. 
  
  Of course, I came back here with my husband. There were three men  on the roadside after the car crash who were helping us to safety. One of these men had walked into highway traffic to help us. He was signaling with his hands for the oncoming traffic to stop. I am happy to have time here to share with those I love and to do my best to use all my expeiences to try and help others whenever possible.
