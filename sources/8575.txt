For   purposes of this study, Soulmates is defined as 'a loving relationship involving   positive co-creation and manifesting spiritual growth' (Long, 2002).&nbsp; The focal   points of this definition are that love is manifested through the relationship   and that each person is able to grow in consciousness as a consequence of the   relationship.&nbsp; The definition used for determining a near death experience (NDE)   is 'A lucid experience associated   with perceived consciousness apart from the body occurring at the time of actual   or threatened imminent death.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  All people who have a NDE, experience a separation of consciousness from their   body, whether they are aware of the actual separation or not.&nbsp; NDErs also   experience a fairly consistent set of circumstances and emotions that they   report after resuscitation.&nbsp;    Since the   study of NDE is so connected to consciousness, a foundational understanding of   consciousness is vital to the study of NDE.&nbsp; The study of consciousness is   integrally connected to the way we process information on earth.&nbsp; Moreover,   information processing is the golden key to unlocking some of the mysteries as   to what our purpose on earth may be, what our true human nature is and what we   might be capable of achieving with these new understandings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

As   a bit of background, at the IANDS annual conference in 2000, Dr. Jeff and I   gave a presentation on our research findings regarding Soulmates.&nbsp; I recently   started to write up the presentation.&nbsp; One of the main questions I wanted to   find out is if, by including the new data, the results of the study would still   hold.&nbsp; It turned out that we had over two times the data as when we started.&nbsp;   Every question analyzed had such a wealth of information contained in each   sub-category that it was impossible to just write-up the Soulmate presentation.&nbsp;   Therefore, I have chosen to write a series of papers based upon the new data and   then write a culmination paper on soulmate understandings incorporating the   findings of the separate papers.

  For the study, NDEs were collected via a web   form questionnaire on the website        www.nderf.org    and the resulting answers were analyzed (Long, 2002).&nbsp; From these patterns   certain principles were derived that led to the unifying theory of spirit   defined as the development of the soul in the process of returning to our   natural spiritual state.&nbsp;

  Soulmates is a necessary component of soul development.&nbsp; NDErs identified the   most important principals as: 1) that everything and everyone is connected; 2)   recognition that the other side is home; 3) unconditional love; 4) support from   both sides of the veil for our soul development; 5) lessons on reconnection; and   6) that Soulmates is one aspect of individuals feeling connected to a supreme   creative being.&nbsp; These principals were derived from the most commonly reported   elements concerning relationships.&nbsp; Questions reviewed were those asking about   encounters with beings (familiar and unfamiliar), comments about relationships,   emotions, feelings, interconnectedness, and universal purpose or order.&nbsp;

  Therefore, the series of papers will analyze answers to the questions of what   beings were seen on the other side, what NDErs perceive as our purpose on earth,   what changes they made after returning to earth, and explore the emotional   content of the NDEs.&nbsp; Concepts derived from these papers will, in turn, be used   to sum up the NDE perspective on Soulmates as reflected against the backdrop of   consciousness studies because how we process information is key to integrating   NDEs with our earthly reality.&nbsp;

  Consciousness

  One aspect of consciousness is how we process information.&nbsp; Most people think   that our memories are stored in the brain, much like a hard drive in a computer   with 100% available recall.&nbsp; Many cannot understand that if a person claims to   have consciousness apart from the body and the brain is flat lined, how can a   person recall their NDE?&nbsp; This is a good point, but easily understood when one   understands the nature of memories, the way we process information, and the way   we recall that information.&nbsp;

  There have been several recent studies on consciousness. One current theory is   that consciousness is where the memories are stored, not in the brain as   previously thought (Berkovich, 2001). [1]      Berkovich is in the forefront of scientists who is exploring the theory that as   an information storage unit, the brain cannot possibly hold all the information   that is required to function in our society. Consequently, scientist are   considering the alternative that the brain is more of an accessing unit much   like a radio receiver. The actual storage place is somewhere else, and NDEs   would strongly suggest that place is the consciousness that survives the body.
  
  Recent findings have shown that we typically store information as a core memory   attached to an emotion and then file it in a concept area in the brain   (Ornstein, 1991).&nbsp; When we retrieve our memories, we are programmed to &quot;fill in   the gaps.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore brain memories rarely are 100% totally accurate.&nbsp; Even   Freud noticed that memories are stored by attaching emotion to them (p. 89). [2]    &nbsp;Emotions organize how we store and access   information in the brain.&nbsp;

  Recalled   memory will be reconstructed using the brain preference for order and   stability.&nbsp; The memory will have a certain order to it and will generally be   re-told in a way that subjectively makes sense to the individual.&nbsp; Analogous to   a computer hard drive, we retrieve the memory chunk of information, by accessing   a particular emotional 'directory' in a certain part of the brain.&nbsp; Then the   memory chunk is connected to one or several information chunks and the brain   makes up the most logical story to connect the separate information chunks.&nbsp;   This means that the information is integrated into an existing subjective   framework of reality.&nbsp;

  That being   said, the NDErs typically report life reviews that contain every thought, deed,   and how we made others feel. Vivid NDE examples, also noted in the landmark NDE   Dutch study by van Lommel, contain memories during physical death of events   categorized as veridical perception (van Lommel, 2001, p. 2043).&nbsp; NDErs were   accurately reporting events they witnessed while in the out of body state during   the time they coded.&nbsp; They couldn't possibly know what the doctors, staff, or   relatives were saying in the same or another room.&nbsp; Nonetheless, NDErs were   privy to actual conversations and events.&nbsp; Dr. Kenneth Ring's study showed that   blind people can see during their NDE (Ring, 1999).&nbsp; There are reports from   child NDErs that can recall NDEs like they happened yesterday.&nbsp; The youngest NDE   reported to NDERF was at age 18 months old.&nbsp; The woman stated, 'These   experiences have stayed crystal clear and as fresh as when they occurred.'

  These reported events cannot be explained by conventional 'brain' theories, such   as brain chemistry, anoxia, random firings of a dying brain, false memories, or   wishful thinking.&nbsp; The model that best fits the data would suggest that the   stream of consciousness that leaves the body does act like a computer hard drive   with 100% memory recall.&nbsp; This is unlike the way the brain processes routine   information. When consciousness returns to the body, it takes years to have   those intense memories of the NDE to funnel through to the brain and to be   integrated with the current earthly reality framework (van Lommel, p. 2043). [3]

  My hypothesis   is that NDE is such an intense experience that it may create access to   consciousness memories and therefore imprints in the brain in a manner similar   to what is known as a &quot;flashbulb moment&quot; (Ornstein, p. 88).&nbsp; Flashbulb moments   are times when the brain takes a picture of a particular instance; usually   occurring in times of heightened sensory and emotional input or life-threatening   moments. These memories are then ingrained in the brain and the person can   recall the event like it happened yesterday.&nbsp; This type of memory is much   different than the way we store and recall routine information.&nbsp; I would suggest   that duality exists between brain and consciousness (mind) because both serve   two very different but necessarily integrated functions.

  The NDE is   almost always reported in terms of a highly emotional experience.&nbsp; Perhaps via   the mechanism of emotion, consciousness (and the memories contained therein) is   more readily accessed by the brain.&nbsp; Most of the time, the NDE recollection is   so far outside of mainstream reality experience, that it may well take years for   a person to process the NDE memory and integrate it into their existing reality   framework in a manner that it can be communicated to self and others.

  With   consciousness and the way we process information as the backdrop, we can look at   the way NDErs process information, reintegrate it into their lives, and   springboard the process into a spiritually transformative event.&nbsp; As mentioned   above, NDErs typically will report their experience in terms of emotion and   relationships.&nbsp; For many, this integration will change their focus from an   earthly, material world to that of spiritual and relationships.&nbsp; Therefore, this   information processing may well be a major component of consciousness that   survives the body.&nbsp; Further study is necessary to understand what types of   information are retained and what part of the experience motivates the NDErs to   change which behaviors on earth.&nbsp; Some of the new soulmate research will yield   clues that answer some of these questions.   

    

                  [1]              Simon Berkovich, Professor of Engineering and Applied Science at the George       Washington University discusses a more theoretical papers exploring the idea       that DNA information in living organisms is not complex enough to explain       the quantity and diversity of information processed in and by the organism       as a whole, and by the brain in particular. Instead, it is postulated that       the DNA information serves as a unique identification key for a given       organism, like a &quot;barcode.&quot;&nbsp; As such, the brain is merely a transmitter and       receiver of information, but not the main place for storage or processing of       information (i.e. memories).     

                  [2]         'Deprived       of emotion, according to Freud, recollections are unrecognizable.&nbsp; Emotional       moments mark the mind.&nbsp; They organize the mind. For many purposes, they are       the mind.'     [3]              '[P]atients were interviewed three times during 8 years, with a matched       control group.&nbsp; Our findings show that this process of change after NDE       tends to take several years to consolidate. . . . [T]he effects of the       experience can be delayed for years, and only gradually and with difficulty       is an NDE accepted and integrated.'
