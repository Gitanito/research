I was dizzy all day. My teachers asked me if I wanted to go to the clinic and then go home but I suggested that I was ok and that I will be fine. After that, everything got blurry. I remember being at lunch. My friend Jeremy was in line and his brother, Joe, was right behind him. When they got out of line, I was standing and I remember saying, ‘My fourth hour teacher asked me if I wanted to go to the clinic and I said no.' Then after that It went black. I can remember hearing questions and seeing myself on the ground but I was just lying there. Then I remember them putting me in an ambulance but seeing that from another point of view. Then I Was blank for a while and then I remember hearing an unfamiliar voice saying my name. I opened my eyes and found myself in an ambulance with oxygen hooked up to me I asked then what happened and they said I had a seizure.
