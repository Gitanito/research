            		Experience Description:   

Just started to give blood, was comfortable with the situation. Passed out quickly. I just remember being very peaceful and then there was complete darkness and I thought, what happened, where am I, what is going on? Then I thought did I die? I died, I can't believe I died. Then I began to fight it, no I can't die. I remembered I had family and where I was and I was scared and I wanted to go home, I came out of it and woke up. I passed out before and never had that happen. The nurse said I had convulsions too that I never had before. They kept checking for my blood pressure to return and that took about half an hour or so because it was so low. I was very weak. They did not get any blood. I'm not sure about NDE but I thought that I died while I was unconscious and did not recover quickly after waking up.
