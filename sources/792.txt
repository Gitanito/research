It was incorporated into Survival Magazine, published  by Clifford Potter, J.W.'s son, about the end of 1932, despite its proclamation that "each month it carries more paid advertising space than any other Spiritualist journal."  The journal featured notices of Mrs. Meurig Morris and her addresses around Britain to thousands of people, and attributed her success to "No Free Admission": All profits were to be divided between the sponsoring spiritualist society and Morris.

Vale Owen, Mrs. Meurig Morris, Estelle Stead, and others, short fiction by Madge Donohoe, C.W. Potter, et al., and testimonials on spiritualism by various prominent society figures.
