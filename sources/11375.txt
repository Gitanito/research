  					 I WAS A THREE-YEAR-OLD CHILD WHO REACHED INTO A FISH AQUARIUM AND GRABBED HOLD OF AN ELECTRIC HEATER THAT HAD BEEN INSERTED INTO THE AQUARIUM. THE BULB BROKE AND I WAS NEARLY ELECTROCUTED.


WHEN FOUND BY MY PARENTS, I WAS GREY, ASHEN, AND STILL BEING HELD BY THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT. I WAS IN SEVERE DISTRESS AND HAD SERIOUS BURNS TO MY LEFT ARM WHEN I WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO THE HOSPITAL. MY RECOVERY WAS LONG AND PAINFUL, AND I ALMOST LOST MY LEFT ARM BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT.


I REMEMBER HARDLY ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE INCIDENT, EXCEPT THE FEELING THAT I HAD LEFT MY BODY AND WAS IN A TUNNEL OF LIGHT.


AS I GOT OLDER, I BEGAN TO HAVE A FEELING OF INCREASED SPIRITUAL AWARENESS AND REVERENCE TOWARDS GOD. I ALSO BEGAN TO HAVE ‘FEELINGS’ THAT ARE HARD TO DESCRIBE, THAT SEEM TO LET ME KNOW OF THINGS INTUITIVELY THAT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, BEFORE THEY UNFOLD.


I HAVE HAD A SECOND EVENT RECENTLY (in 1998), IN WHICH I FELT I LEFT MY BODY AND MET WITH MY DECEASED GRANDMOTHER. I WAS INFORMED OF THE PENDING ARRIVAL OF A SON, WHO I DID NOT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE. IN 1999, MY WIFE GAVE BIRTH TO MY SON, AS MY LONG DEAD GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME IN MY DREAM.


TO THIS DAY, MY INTUITIVE FEELINGS PERSIST.
