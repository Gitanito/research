ABSTRACT
Theaimofthisresearchistoprovewhetherafterlife,heavenandhellreallyexist.
This research is carried out through comparing the testimonies of 40 witnesses
who underwent near-death experience to what the Bible says about heaven and
hell.
There are some verses in the Bible that described heaven and hell. The Bible
is the comparing tools for this research, so the key words in the Bible verses that
describe how heaven and hell look like are underlined and collected. What the
witnesses said in their testimonies during their near-death experience will be
compared to the description of heaven and hell in the Bible.
The witnesses come from various countries, background and professions
in the period of 128 years, from 1887 to 2015. Each testimony is analysed using
qualitative approach to find out the key words of what they said that described
heaven and hell.
The key words are classified into some categories and sub categories. The key
words of the testimonies are compared to the key words of the Bible, and also
compared the testimonies to each other. The result of the comparison is then
analysed using quantitative approach. The number of the similarities are counted
to know the percentage of each category.
Some of the main data is then presented in statistic (graphics) to reveal the
similarities between the Bible and the testimonies. These similarities prove
whether the Bible is true or not about afterlife, heaven and hell.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1. THE BACKGROUND
There is a fact that no one can deny “the death”. How powerful, rich and
intelligent a person is, he cannot prevent himself for being died. There is a time
limit for everyone living in this earth. The longest age the people ever live is around
100 years. But someone doesn’t need to be old to die. Everyone can die at any age
and because of any case like illness and accident, even being murdered by someone
else.
Since living in this earth is not eternal, the important question is if there is
another life after this life in this earth has ended? All religions try to answer this
question and they prepare their members to face the afterlife according to their
belief and doctrine. Even the atheists have the concept of afterlife that it does not
exist. Is it true or not?
As a Christian, my curiosity leads me to investigate the fact about afterlife
through the testimonies of those who have undergone near-death experience, and
to prove whether what the Bible says about heaven and hell are true or not if they
are compared to these testimonies.
2
1.2. THE PROBLEM OF THE RESEARCH:
Afterlife is still is a mystery. So, there are some questions that can be defined
as the problems that will be investigated through this research. The problems are:
1. Does afterlife really exist?
2. Do heaven and hell really exist?
3. Does the Bible tell the truth about afterlife?
1.3. THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH
The purpose of this research is like the following:
1. To prove whether afterlife exists or not
2. To prove whether heaven and hell exist or not
3. To prove whether what the Bible says is true or not
1.4. THE BENEFIT OF THE RESEARCH
This research will answer the most common and basic question of all mankind
about afterlife since everyone will die someday. This research is carried out in
Christian point of view because the Bible will be the main reference to prove the
existence of afterlife.
This research can be followed by the other religions with their “Bible” to prove
whether the afterlife experienced by their religious members is in accordance with
their teaching or their “Holy Book”
1.5. THE LIMITATION OF THE RESEARCH
There are so many testimonies about afterlife from various religions, even
from the atheists.
This research is focused to prove the truth of the Bible about afterlife. So, the
testimonies of afterlife that are taken for this research are only the testimonies that
are in accordance with the Bible. The testimonies can be both from Christians and
non Christians as long as what they testified is in accordance with what the Bible
says about afterlife.
There are about 100 testimonies of afterlife in the period of 100 years from
3
various countries. These testimonies are in accordance with the Bible. But this
research will only analyse 40 testimonies because this research is a part of book
that has been previously published in Indonesia. The book is a compilation of near-
death experience testimonies that was analysed at the end chapter of the book.

CHAPTER 2.
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
2.1. A RESEARCH ON WHAT THE PEOPLE BELIEVE ABOUT HEAVEN AND HELL
There was a research on what the people living in US believe about God,
heaven and hell. This research was hold by Pewresearch.org in 2014. The result is
like the table below:
5
2.2. WHAT IS NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE?
There are some definitions about Near-Death Experience like the following:
Wikipedia.org:
A near-death experience (NDE) is a profound personal experience associated
withdeathorimpendingdeathwhichresearchersclaimsharesimilarcharacteristics.
When positive, such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations including
detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth,
the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. When negative,
such experiences may include sensations of anguish and distress
6
Dictionary.Cambridge.org:
An experience described by some people who have been close to death, in
which the person feels as if they have left their body and are watching themselves
from above.
Merriam-Webster.com:
An occurrence in which a person comes very close to dying and has memories
of a spiritual experience (such as meeting dead friends and family members or
seeing a white light) during the time when death was near.
Collinsdictionary.com:
A near-death experience is a strange experience that some people who have
nearly died say they had when they were unconscious.
From this definition, we can conclude that near-death experience is a personal
experience when someone has been closed to death, felt as if they left their body
and watched themselves from above, they have memories of spiritual and strange
experience during the time when they were unconscious and near to death. This
experience can be positive or negative.
2.3. THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE BY TWO
MEDICAL DOCTORS
Near-death experience (NDE) has been a debate both by general people and
the scientists. Many people think that it is a taboo, a mystery that can’t be proven.
It is beyond science. It is just a myth ever told by many religions. Science only deals
with something that can be proved. According to Cambridge dictionary, science is
knowledge from the careful study of the structure and behaviour of the physical world,
especially by watching, measuring, and doing experiments, and the development of
theories to describe the results of these activities. But two medical doctors have
done a research on NDE. They are Dr Maurice Rawlings from US and followed by Dr
Richard Kent from UK.
7
2.4. DR MAURICE RAWLINGS
Dr Maurice Rawlings was a cardiologist at the Chattanooga Hospital and
Diagnostic Centre, Tennessee, United States. During the Second World War, Dr
Rawlings had served in the US Army and Navy. He was promoted to be a private
physician to leaders at the Pentagon. Dr Rawlings was also a personal physician for
the 34th American president, president Dwight Eisenhower.
Dr Rawlings was a national instructor at the American Heart Association, with
special expertise to teach methods to save patients from sudden death. He taught
in various medical schools and hospitals, and conducted training for doctors and
nurses in many countries related to his expertise in the field of heart disease. He
was an Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of Tennessee, a member of
the International Committee for Cardiovascular Disease, a former chairman for the
American College of Cardiology in the State of Tennessee, founder of the Medical
Services Board for Emergencies in Tennessee and instructor of the advanced
program for managing heart disease. He also wrote many articles about heart
disease for medical journals in the United States.
As an expert doctor and teacher in the field of heart disease, Dr Rawlings has
handledmanypatientswhoareonthevergeofdeath.AccordingtoDrRawlings50%
of patients who died clinically when the heart stopped beating or flatline, could be
saved by the resuscitation method or spur the heart with a pacemaker. Dr Rawlings
was used to dealing with heart patients until one day there was something that
bothered him when he was dealing with a heart patient named Charles McKaig.
Since then he began conducting research by interviewing patients who were saved
from clinical death.
Charles McKaig was a 57-year-old man whose job was delivering letters.
Charles was immediately taken to the hospital when he had a heart attack and was
treated by Dr Rawlings. The nurse put in a breathing aid and Dr Rawlings placed
a pacemaker on Charles’s chest to surprise and restore his heartbeat. Dr Rawlings
was very surprised when the patient said, “Help me, help me, I don’t want to go back
to hell!” Every time Dr Rawlings stopped to regulate his pacemaker, Charles would
become spasms, turn blue, stop breathing and his heart would stop beating. Then
Dr Rawlings spurred his heart again to restore his heartbeat, so repeatedly. Every
time the pacemaker stopped, Charles returned to hell. And each time his heart beat
after a race, Charles cried out for help to get out of hell.
Charles’s words about the hell he experienced were ignored by Dr Rawlings
because he was very busy to save Charles’s life. Dr Rawlings told Charles to be quiet
8
because he was concentrating on helping him. But Charles continued to say that he
was in hell when his heart stopped beating and begged Dr Rawlings not to stop his
pacemaker so he would not return to hell. Charles begged Dr Rawlings to pray for
him.
On Dr Rawlings’s opinion, his patient’s request was ridiculous because he was
a cardiologist, not a priest. Then one of the nurses felt sorry for Charles and begged
Dr Rawlings to heed the dying patient’s request. Charles pleaded once again that
Dr Rawlings would pray for him and the nurse looked at Dr Rawlings to grant the
patient’s request. Just for making his patient keep silent and not bothering him
again, finally Dr Rawlings asked the patient to imitate the words of prayer he was
saying. Actually Dr Rawlings himself thought that prayer was just nonsense. Thus
the words said by Dr Rawlings and imitated by Charles, “I believe that Jesus Christ
is the Son of God. Jesus please save my soul. Let me stay alive. But if I die, please
save me from hell! “ Dr Rawlings said that after Charles said the words of prayer, he
calmed down. It looked that he did not wrestle with the experience of hell anymore.
Charles’s life was finally saved. Sometime later after Charles was healthier, Dr
Rawlings asked him about how his experience in hell had been said at that time,
when his heart stopped beating and had a flatline or clinical death. Charles said that
after saying the prayer by imitating Dr Rawlings’ words, he did not experience hell
anymore, instead he met his mother in heaven even though she had died. From that
moment on, Charles became a genuine Christian.
Although listed as a Christian, but in fact Dr Rawlings have thoughts like
atheists. The prayer which he initially thought was just nonsense and he said just
to console his patient, not only saved Charles from hell and changed his life, but
also changed Dr Rawlings himself. Both Charles and Dr Rawlings have been born
again Christians ever since. And from that moment Dr Rawlings was interested in
interviewing his patients who had survived clinical death. The results of interviews
with these patients were then made into research and analysed by Dr Rawlings and
his colleagues.
Dr Rawlings’ initial research results showed that 18% of the 200 patients
interviewed showed a ‘hellish experience’ when they experienced clinical death.
Thisnumberincreasedwhenmoredoctorsjoinedinthisstudyandmoreinformation
was collected from the ICU. The results of subsequent studies show that patients
who experience hell while experiencing clinical death are increasing in number.
Dr Rawlings said that many patients who survived but experienced hell while
experiencing clinical death, tried to hide this experience out of fear. When they
were interviewed to recall their experiences, they screamed as they described the
9
fires of hell. Another Dr Rawlings patient who also experienced hell during clinical
death was an actor from Houston. He was rushed to the hospital because there was
a problem in the aortic artery. The actor told Dr Rawlings that at the time of clinical
death, he felt slid down and flames were sprinkling around him. Then he saw a
black creature man.
Another patient interviewed by Dr Rawlings was a doctor. He was watching
a soccer game that was so exciting when suddenly his heart stopped beating and
he was immediately rushed to the hospital from the sports stadium. The nurses
immediately managed to do the defibrillation to save him. The doctor continued
to shout, “I’m in hell!” His wife bowed down beside his bed. The doctor’s wife
was a Christian while the doctor did not believe in Christianity and even hated all
Christians. But this experience had completely changed his life and he became a
Christian.
Dr Rawlings found a case where a patient who had a clinical death was a blind
person. When he was clinically dead, he said that he could see very clearly. He could
see the doctors and nurses who were trying to save him, what they were doing and
even what clothes they were wearing. But when he came back to live, he was blind
again.
According to Dr Rawlings experiment, of those patients who could be saved
from clinical death, 60% did not experience afterlife. Only 40% experience both
heaven and hell. Some patients said that death was not painful, they just felt the
sensation out of the body. If the patients were true Christians, they said that what
they saw was the evidence of what they believed because they saw heaven and even
met Jesus Christ. But for patients who had terrifying experiences, they were very
afraid of death because they were afraid of the hell they had seen.
Dr Rawlings wrote several books on Near Death Experiences. These books were
written based on his experience and research as a doctor who dealt a lot with heart
disease patients who were on the verge of death, even dying clinically, but then had
the chance to live again. From his research, Dr Rawlings proved that life after death
existed and that not all life in the afterlife were pleasant. The following were the
books by Dr Maurice Rawlings:
• “Beyond Death’s Door”
• “To Hell and Back”
• “Life Wish: Reincarnation, Reality or Hoax? (Life Expectancy: Reincarnation,
Reality or Fake News)
• “Before Death Comes” (Before Death Comes)
10
A few years later Dr Rawlings advised the following:
“If you can save people before they die and give them the choice to accept Jesus
Christ as their Saviour, they will not be lost whether they live or die. That salvation
will be with them forever. When they die, we don’t need to question where they will
go because they will go to heaven with God. But for those who die on the streets,
where will they go? This is the pastor’s fault, your fault and mine’s fault because we
do not preach the gospel to them even though the gospel is a gift for all who want
to receive it. “
Dr Rawlings died on January 5, 2010 in Tennessee, United States.

2.5. DR RICHARD KENT
DrRichardKentwasfromUK.HemarriedanursenamedVal.Withhisprofession
as a doctor, Richard was very accustomed to the death of patients at various ages.
Since their 4-year-old patient died of leukemia, they have been trying to find out
what the meaning of life was and where humans would go after death. They studied
the Bible and got the meaning of life from the Bible. Richard and Val became born
again Christians in 1974.
11
Dr Richard Kent became interested in researching the phenomenon of NDE
(Near Death Experience) due to the influence of Dr Maurice Rawlings, a cardiologist
who had previously conducted research on near-death in patients who experienced
clinical death. Dr Richard said that when he interviewed his patients who were
able to live again after experiencing clinical death, what they said was not caused
by hallucinations, narcotics or changes in brain conditions. Apart from being a
general practitioner, Dr Richard also worked in anesthesia unit at the hospital. He
was accustomed to patients who experienced clinical death due to heart attacks or
other illnesses.
Dr Richard discovered the fact that the experiences told by these near-death
patients were almost the same even though they did not know each other. Their
experience was also in accordance with what was said in the Bible. These patients
consider the experience they experienced when suspended animation was the
most important thing in their lives. According to Dr Richard, this would not have
happenedifwhattheyweretellingwasjustahallucination.Patientswhoexperience
near-death in general experience very radical life changes. Even they are willing to
lose comfort from the financial side and relationships with others because of the
changes they live. One of them is Dr Richard’s patient named Shahid Siraj Din from
Pakistan. He is willing to leave his very lucrative business as a property developer
and prefers to become an evangelist with no income at all.
Most of the lifestyle changes of these patients who have suffered near death
have been scorned by their family and friends, because they cannot understand the
new passion of these patients to pursue spiritual things. These patients generally
turn out to be very religious and lose interest in pursuing worldly matters. They also
experience a dilemma. On the one hand they really want to share their experiences
in the afterlife with family, friends and colleagues, but on the other hand they are
aware that they will be laughed at and rejected if they do. Therefore, these patients
usually keep these experience meetings for themselves. They said that they felt
very relieved to be able to share their experiences in the afterlife with Dr Richard
without fear of being ridiculed or ridiculed.
Dr Richard also experienced scorn and rejection because of his research
and belief in the afterlife experience of his patients. Rejection mainly came from
atheists. But Dr Richard personally believes that the phenomenon of near death or
Near-Death Experience reveals a reality about the existence of life after death. Dr
Richard believes that the afterlife is a reality, not only because it is revealed by the
Bible, but also because research results from patients prove that heaven and hell
exist because they have seen or experienced themselves during their clinical death.
12
Dr Richard’s research is outlined in his books entitled ‘The Final Frontier’ and
‘Beyond The Final Frontier’. Both of these books contain the testimonies of 51
patients who suffered near death and met Jesus Christ. They visited heaven and
hell while experiencing clinical death. After retiring as a doctor, Richard served
as a speaker at various conferences and evangelism. Richard and Val Kent have
spoken in various places such as in England, the United States, Europe, Africa, the
Caribbean, Pakistan, etc.

2.6. BIBLE FIGURES WHO SAW HEAVEN
After life, heaven and hell are clearly revealed and described in the Bible. Some
figures in the Bible also saw heaven through vision. Even Jesus Christ himself
described the afterlife and the separate places between heaven and hell in the story
of Lazarus and the rich man. (Luke 16:19-31).
Here are some Bible figures who got vision of heaven
Jacob
Jacob later given the name Israel, is regarded as a Patriarch of the Israelites and
so is an important figure in Abrahamic religions, such as Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam. Jacob first appears in the Book of Genesis, the son of Isaac and Rebecca,
the grandson of Abraham, and Sarah. Jacob had 12 sons that became the 12 tribes
of Israel. Jacob got the vision of heaven when he was at Bethel.
Genesis 28:10-13
Jacob’s Dream at Bethel
13
10
Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. 11
When he reached a certain
place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the
stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. 12
He had a
dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching
to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 13
There
above it[a]
stood the Lord, and he said: “I am the Lord, the God of your father
Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on
which you are lying.
Ezekiel
Ezekiel was a prophet from the clan of Zadok and was taken as prisoner to Babylon.
Ezekiel became a prophet for the Israelites who were exiled to Babylon in 593 BC. A
portion of Ezekiel’s vision is written as follows:
Ezekiel 1 : 26 – 28 (NIV)
26
Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis
lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. 27
I saw
that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as
if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light
surrounded him. 28
Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy
day, so was the radiance around him.
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw
it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
Daniel
Daniel was a nobleman of Judah who was taken in captivity to Babylon. He got this
vision around 553 BC.
Daniel 7: 1, 9-10
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and
visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrote down the
substance of his dream.
9
“As I looked,
“thrones were set in place,
    	 and the Ancient of Days took his seat.
His clothing was as white as snow;
14
    the hair of his head was white like wool.
His throne was flaming with fire,
    and its wheels were all ablaze.
10
A river of fire was flowing,
    coming out from before him.
Thousands upon thousands attended him;
    ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.
The court was seated,
    and the books were opened.
Stephen
Stephen was an apostle who had a vision of heaven and was stoned by the Jews to
be martyred. This story of Stephen took place in AD 35 and was written in the book
of Acts.
Acts 7:55-56
55
But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory
of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. 56
“Look,” he said, “I see
heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”
Paul
Paul was a Christian persecutor before he was converted and became an apostle.
Paul wrote his vision of being in Macedonia for the Corinthians around 55-57 AD.
2 Corinthians 12:2 - 4
2
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third
heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God
knows. 3
And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the
body I do not know, but God knows— 4
was caught up to paradise and heard
inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell.
John
JohnisoneofthetwelveapostlesofJesusChrist.AtthattimetheRomangovernment
banished John to the island of Patmos. It was there that John had many visions of
heaven, hell and the end times. His vision was written in the book of Revelation
around AD 95. Some of the vision he got is as follows :
15
Revelation 1:13-18
13
and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man,[a]
dressed in a
robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 14
The
hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were
like blazing fire. 15
His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his
voice was like the sound of rushing waters. 16
In his right hand he held seven
stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face
was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
17
When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right
hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. 18
I am
the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I
hold the keys of death and Hades.
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ told His disciples that He prepared the places for them in heaven
John 14: 2-3
2
My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you
that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 3
And if I go and prepare a
place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may
be where I am.
Jesus Christ himself described the afterlife and the separate places between heaven
and hell in the story of Lazarus and the rich man.
Luke 16:19-31
The Rich Man and Lazarus
19
“There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived
in luxury every day. 20
At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered
with sores 21
and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the
dogs came and licked his sores.
22
“The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to
Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23
In Hades, where
he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus
by his side. 24
So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send
16
Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am
in agony in this fire.’
25
“But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received
your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted
here and you are in agony. 26
And besides all this, between us and you a great
chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you
cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’
27
“He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 28
for I
have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this
place of torment.’
29
“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to
them.’
30
“‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them,
they will repent.’
31
“He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will
not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”
2.7. BIBLE VERSES ABOUT HEAVEN AND HELL

2.8. THE TERM ‘HELL’ BEFORE AND AFTER THE FINAL JUDGEMENT
The terms hell actually have different words in the original languages ​​
of the
Bible i.e. Hebrew and Greek. Sheol is the Hebrew for hell, so is Hades in Greek.
Sheol and Hades are hellish terms before the final judgement, where all the souls of
sinners are after death. Final judgement according to the Bible is the end time when
God will judge all mankind.
12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and
books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The
dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
(Revelation 20:12)
Whereas Gehenna is hell in Greek which means the lake of fire, which is eternal
punishment for the devil and his followers. Gehenna is hell after the judgment
period. According to the Berean Bible Society, the word Sheol was written 65 times
in the Bible, Hades was written 11 times and Gehenna was written 12 times. Sheol,
Hades and Gehenna are often translated as hell. (Bedore, W.Edward, Hell, Sheol,

CHAPTER 3
DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
3.1. RESEARCH METHOD
This research applied both qualitative and quantitative approach. First, the
data is analysed using qualitative approach. Then, the findings are presented in
quantitative statistics.
The data is the testimonies of near-death experiences. Each testimony will be
analysed using qualitative approach to find out the key words stated by the one
who underwent near-death experiences. The key words that state the description
of heaven and hell then are compared to what the Bible says about heaven and hell.
There results of the comparison are classified, counted and presented in
statistics.
3.2. POPULATION
There are too many testimonies about near-death experiences from various
religions, even from the atheists.
This research limits the population with these criteria:
- The testimonies of afterlife, heaven and hell experienced through near-death
experience, not testimonies got through visions. Near-death experience
19
is considered more valid experience rather than the vision because there
are usually some witnesses who saw their death such as the family, friends,
doctors and nurses.
- The testimonies of near-death experience that are in accordance with what
the Bible says about heaven and hell. So, only the testimonies that stated
what are written in the Bible are included in the population of this research.
- The near-death testimonies refer to Jesus Christ or Christianity although
they were not Christians when they underwent the near-death experience.
- There was life-changing of the witnesses who underwent the near-death
experiences to become better or wiser persons. Most of them even being
called to be pastors.
There are about 100 testimonies about near-death experience, heaven and
hell that is in accordance with the Bible in the period of 100 years, from 1887 to
2015. These testimonies were found on the net, both on Google (texts) and You
tube (videos).
3.3. SAMPLE
40 testimonies will be taken among the population as the sample. Most
testimoniescamefromUSA.Itdoesnotmeantherearemorenear-deathtestimonies
inUSAthaninanyotherpartsoftheworld.ButthereisanassumptionthatAmerican
witness tends to record their near-death experience using text, audio or video.
Maybe there are many testimonies in Asia and Africa, but they have not been used
to document their experience. So, the 40 samples were chosen to represent various
countries where the witnesses live and the years when the near-death happened
in the period of 100 years.
The 40 testimonies are the testimonies that are published on the net. It can
be the testimonies in the form of texts or in the form of videos. Although many
witnesses also wrote their testimonies in books, but what will be analysed is not
their testimonies in their books but the testimonies on the net because they are
briefer and more focused on the main idea of the testimonies, i.e. their experience
while they were out of the body or their near-death experience
3.4. RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS
The instruments used here is the computer, PC or laptop and the internet
connection, because the data is taken from the net, i.e. from Google and You tube.
20
The data is the testimonies of those who underwent near-death experience which
are published on the net.
3.5. RESEARCH RESPONDENTS
The respondents of this research are 40 witnesses who underwent near-
death experience, and their testimonies were recorded in texts or videos that are
published on the net.

3.6. THE METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION
3.6.1. DATA FROM THE BIBLE
It is a comparison study that compares what are written in the Bible about
heaven and hell and what are stated by the witnesses about heaven and hell they
saw or experienced while they underwent near-death experience.
So, the first data must be from the Bible, as the main reference. The verses
about heaven and hell are displayed. The words or phrases that describe the
characteristics of heaven and hell are underlined. All the underlined words and
phrases are rewritten as the points that reveal the characteristics or description of
heaven and hell.
For example:
Revelation 21 : 18-21
18
The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. 19
The
foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious
stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate,
the fourth emerald, 20
the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the
eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the
twelfth amethyst.[f] 21
The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of
a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent
glass.
The description of heaven:
- The wall was made of jasper
- The city of pure gold
- The city foundations were decorated with precious stones
23
- 12 gates
- The pearl gates
- The golden road
3.6.2. DATA FROM THE TESTIMONIES
The data from the 40 testimonies are collected with the following steps:
1. The written testimonies (texts) found at Google are copied and making a
word file for each testimony.
2. The video testimonies found at You tube are transcribed and making a word
file for each testimony.
3. Making a list of the 40 witnesses, including their nationality, profession,
cause of death and the date of year of their near-death experience.
4. Making a code for each witness, for example witness 1 = W1, witness 2 =
W2.
5. Reading each testimony and finding out the key words stated by the
witness that describe about heaven and hell they saw or experienced using
qualitative approach.
6. Underline each word, phrase and sentence considered as the key words
7. Rewrite the underline words, phrases and sentences as the key words stated
by the witness about heaven and hell they saw or experienced
For example, the testimony of Mrs Jang from Shan Tung Province, China in
1904 as being told to Ms Louisa Vaughan who was a missionary from USA.
Mrs Jang died because of Tuberculosis but she came back to life. Ms Vaughan
wrote this testimony on her book “Answered or Unanswered” pages 42-46,
from which the quote is taken like the following:
“In the year of 1904, I held a meeting of several day’s duration in the city
of Wang Kia Kwan Dswang. My audience consisted of the most stupid and
ignorant of Chinese women. Some of them were converts, but most of them
came to hear the Gospel for the first time. Among these last was a Mrs. Jang,
who seemed, if possible, a little more stupid than the rest.
…….. Mrs. Jang had died at three o’clock the afternoon before, and her family,
in accordance with Chinese custom, had immediately prepared her body for
24
burial. At about sunset they heard a noise in the death chamber. They supposed
that the children or pigs or chickens (they have equal freedom in the houses of
the poor) had gotten into the room. But when they opened the door they could
scarcely believe their eyes. Mrs. Jang sat erect on the kang. She had removed
her grave clothes and put on those she had been wearing before her death!
“I never taught Revelation in China and nothing had ever been told Mrs. Jang
of the glories of Heaven as described in that book. She had instruction for only
eight days in her life.
“This is her story as she related it to me: ‘I remember seeing all the family
around me crying. Then the Lord Jesus came into my room and took me by
the hand and said, ‘Come with me!’ In a short time we were before a gate of
pearl. It was the gate of Heaven. Angels opened it and we went in. I saw many
beautiful houses all of pretty colours. I walked beside the Lord on the golden
streets. Miss Vaughan, I was so glad you had told me to unbind my feet; I would
have been so ashamed to walk beside my Saviour with little feet.
“Then we went on and I saw thousands of angels in a circle, singing and playing
lovely music. In the midst was the throne of glory. The Heavenly Father sat
upon it, and when I saw Him I was afraid. I hardly dared to lift my eyes’.
CODE KEY WORDS
W39 a gate of pearl, the gate of heaven, beautiful houses, pretty colours,
the golden streets, thousands of angels, singing and playing lovely
music, throne of glory.
3.7. THE METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS
As it is a comparison study, so it will compare what the Bible describe about
heaven and hell and what the witnesses state about heaven and hell they saw or
experience when they underwent near-death experience.
3.7.1. DATA ANALYSIS WITH QUALITATIVE APPROACH
The steps of analysis using a qualitative approach is like the following:
1. The description of heaven and hell in the Bible is classified into 2 main
topics: heaven and hell
25
2. Both heaven and hell topics are classified into some categories
3. Each category is classified into sub categories that give more detail
description about heaven and hell
4. Each sub category is supported with the Bible verses.
5. Drawing a table to display each sub category and the supporting Bible verses
6. Comparing the key words stated by the witnesses to the sub categories on
the table
7. The verses are started from the sub categories, but the verses can also be
started from the statements of the witness that are supported by the Bible
verses.
8. Input the witness code into the table where the key words are matching
with the sub categories
9. SomestatementsthatarenotsupportedbytheBibleversesarealsoclassified
into sub categories as long as there are similarities with each other

3.7.2. DATA ANALYSIS WITH QUANTITATIVE APPROACH
After the data has been collected and classified into some categories using
qualitative approach, then the data is counted and presented using quantitative
approach, following these steps:
1. Counting the numbers of witnesses from each category, both the heaven and
the hell categories.
2. Some witness experienced heaven, some experienced hell and some
experience both heaven and hell during their near-death experience.
Counting the total number of witnesses who experience heaven and hell
3. Comparing the number of the witnesses from each category with the total
number to count the percentage of each category.
4. Presenting the result of the percentage of each category into a statistic table

13 and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man [a] dressed in a robe
reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 14 The hair on
his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.
15 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound
of rushing waters. 16 In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his
mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its
brilliance.
17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand
on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. 18 I am the Living
One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of
death and Hades.

Revelation 4:1-11
The Throne in Heaven
4 After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And
the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and
I will show you what must take place after this.” 2 At once I was in the Spirit, and
there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. 3 And the one
who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an
emerald encircled the throne. 4 Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other
thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white
and had crowns of gold on their heads. 5 From the throne came flashes of lightning,
rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing.
These are the seven spirits[a] of God. 6 Also in front of the throne there was what
looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal.
In the centre, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered
29
with eyes, in front and in back. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second
was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.
8 Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all
around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying:
“‘Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord God Almighty,’[b]
who was, and is, and is to come.”
9 Whenever the living creatures give glory, honour and thanks to him who sits on
the throne and who lives for ever and ever, 10 the twenty-four elders fall down
before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever.
They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
11 “You are worthy, our Lord and God,
to receive glory and honour and power,
for you created all things,
and by your will they were created
and have their being.”

Revelation 21
A New Heaven and a New Earth
21 Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,”[a] for the first heaven and the first
earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. 2 I saw the Holy City,
the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride
beautifully dressed for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne
saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell
with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their
God. 4 ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’[b] or
mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”
5 He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he
said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”
6 He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the
End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
7 Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will
be my children. 8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the
sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they
will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
The New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb
9 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues
came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 10
31
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me
the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. 11 It shone with the
glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper,
clear as crystal. 12 It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels
at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. 13
There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three
on the west. 14 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
15 The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city,
its gates and its walls. 16 The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide.
He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia[c] in length,
and as wide and high as it is long. 17 The angel measured the wall using human
measurement, and it was 144 cubits[d] thick.[e] 18 The wall was made of jasper,
and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. 19 The foundations of the city walls were
decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the
second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 20 the fifth onyx, the sixth
ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise,
the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.[f] 21 The twelve gates were twelve
pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as
pure as transparent glass.
22 I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb
are its temple. 23 The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the
glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. 24 The nations will walk by its
light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. 25 On no day will its
gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. 26 The glory and honour of the
nations will be brought into it. 27 Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone
who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in
the Lamb’s book of life.

Eden Restored
22 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing
from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 down the middle of the great street of
the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit,
yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the
nations. 3 No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will
be in the city, and his servants will serve him. 4 They will see his face, and his name
will be on their foreheads. 5 There will be no more night. They will not need the
light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they

you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed
clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and
you came to visit me.’ 37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we
see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When
did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39
When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’ 40 “The King will reply,
‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters
of mine, you did for me.’

4.1.2. VERSES IN THE BIBLE ABOUT HELL

15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into
the lake of fire.
Revelation 21:8
8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral,
those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to
the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
Revelation 14:11
11 And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest
day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who
receives the mark of its name.”
36
Mark 9 : 43 – 48
43 If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life
maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. [44] [a]
45 And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life
crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. [46] [b] 47 And if your eye
causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God
with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, 48 where
“‘the worms that eat them do not die,
and the fire is not quenched.’
Isaiah 66:24
24 “And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against
me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be
quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”
Matthew 25:41-46
41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into
the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you
gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a
stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me,
I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’44 “They also will answer,
‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or
sick or in prison, and did not help you?’ 45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever
you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ 46 “Then they will
go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”
Matthew 13:41-42
41 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom
everything that causes sin and all who do evil. 42 They will throw them into the
blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew 25:30
30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will
be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
37
2 Peter 2:17
17 These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest
darkness is reserved for them.
2 Thessalonians 1:9
9Theywillbepunishedwitheverlastingdestructionandshutoutfromthepresence
of the Lord and from the glory of his might.
Luke 16:19-31
The Rich Man and Lazarus
19 “There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in
luxury every day. 20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with
sores 21 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came
and licked his sores.
22 “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s
side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In Hades, where he was in torment,
he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to
him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger
in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’
25 “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your
good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and
you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has
been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can
anyone cross over from there to us.’
27 “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 28 for I have
five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of
torment.’
29 “Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’
30 “‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they
will repent.’
31 “He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be
convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSION
5.1. CONCLUSION OF THE RESEARCH
After comparing the testimonies of the witnesses who underwent near-death
experience to what the Bible says about heaven and hell, this research found the
answers of the problems stated at chapter 1.
5.1.1. Does afterlife really exist?
This research proves that afterlife really exists.
The Bible tells about afterlife, so do the witnesses.
According to the testimonies of the witnesses, as confirmed by two medical
doctors who have done the previous research on near-death experience,
there are two kinds of afterlife, the positive afterlife, i.e. a happy afterlife and a
negative afterlife, i.e. a terrible afterlife.
5.1.2. Do heaven and hell really exist?
Some of the witnesses told about positive experience of afterlife. They saw or
experienced the wonderful and happy afterlife, even some of them did not want
to go back to the earth. What they saw and experienced is similar to what the
Bible says about heaven. Some of the witnesses told about negative experience
82
of afterlife. They saw or experienced very scary afterlife. Even this experience
totally changed their opinion about God and afterlife, and also changed their
life to be true Christians. Some of them became pastors.
These witnesses said about what they saw or experienced during their near-
death experience. What interesting here is that what they saw or experienced
is the same with what is written in the Bible and is almost the same with each
other. The background of 40 witnesses are different from each other such as:
• The witnesses live in different time, from the period of 128 years.
The oldest data is the testimony of George Lennox from Kansas, USA
in 1887. The newest data is the testimony of Zack Clements from
Texas USA in 2015.
• The witnesses came from different countries such as USA, UK,
Nigeria, China, Pakistan, Myanmar, Singapore, Indonesia, Russia,
Czech Republic, etc
83
• Although not all of the witnesses mentioned their age, but some data
reveals that they had different age when they underwent near-death
experience:
- The youngest is Landon Kemp from North Carolina, USA.
He was a kid of 8 years old when he underwent near-death
experience.
- There were some teenagers i.e. Zack Clements (17 years old)
from Texas, USA and Jan Bostik (17 years old) from Czech
Republic.
- There are some adults such as Matthew Bostford (28 years
old) from Michigan, USA and Boris Philipchuk (36 years old)
from Ukraine.
- There are some older witnesses such as Randall Rathbun
(51 years old) from California, USA and Charles McKaig (56
years old) from Tennessee, USA
• The witnesses had different profession and background such as
students, businessmen, police, army, pastors, doctors, housewives,
employees, jobless, drug addicts, prisoner, etc
• The witnesses had different background of education. Some
witnesses were still students, some had low education as jobless and
drug addicts and some were blue collar workers, but some witnesses
had very good education such as:
- Randall Rathbun from California, USA, was a computer
scientist engineer who had magna cum laude honour from
Montana State University, USA
- Dr George Rodonaia from Russia was a psychiatrist and a
neuropathologist who had M.D and Ph.D degree
- Dr Donald Whitaker from Oklahom, USA was a physician
who had Ph.D in research and science.
84
• They had different cause of death such as car accident, heart attack,
drug overdose, commit suicide, surgery, etc
The witnesses have different background, live in different time and
countries and do not know to each other, but they saw or experienced
almost the same things when they underwent near-death experience.
Their experience is also the same with what is written in the Bible, such
as :
- Some witnesses saw or walked on the golden street in heaven.
They are:
o Abraham ‘Iply’ George from Eskimo, Alaska in 2005
o Boris Philipchuk from Ukraine in 1998
o Theo Nez from New Mexico, USA in 1995
o Park Yong Gyu from South Korea in 1987
o Yong Thang from Myanmar in 1984
o Ms Jang from China in 1904
85
- Some witnesses smelled very bad odour in hell (hades). They
are:
o Richmond Gyimah from Ghana, Africa in 2009
o Abraham ‘Iply’ George from Eskimo, Alaska in 2005
o Tyrone Williams from California, USA in 2001
o Carl Knighton from Ohio, USA in 1997
o Park Yong Gyu from South Korea in 1987
o Veronika Ulrike from Germany in 1981
o Bryan W. Melvin from Arizona, USA in 1980
The summary of the similarities saw or experienced by the witnesses as
well as the similarities with what is written in the Bible can be described
more clearly through the graphics below. From 40 witnesses, 25 witnesses
experienced heaven and 30 witnesses experienced hell.

5.1.3. Does the Bible tell the truth about afterlife?
The Bible has described what heaven and hell look like. As mentioned above,
the witnesses said the same things about heaven and hell although they
come from different countries, background, period of time and professions.
The witnesses do not know each other because it is in a period of 128 years
from 1887 to 2015. But what they said is almost the same to each other and
also the same to what is written in the Bible. So, these testimonies prove
that what the Bible says about heaven and hell is true.
5.2. RECOMMENDATION FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
This research on afterlife, heaven and hell through comparing the testimonies
of near-death witnesses to what the Bible says about afterlife, heaven and hell were
carried out using Christian point of view because the comparing tools is the Bible.
This kind of research can also be carried out through the other religions
point of view. So, another research using the same methodology can be applied
to compare the testimonies of near-death experience to a certain religion point of
view according to their teaching or “Holy Book”.

THE TESTIMONY OF ZACK CLEMENTS
Picture resource:
Teenager With Cardiac Arrest Saw Jesus, Video You Tube, Dikirim oleh “ Lion
Ground”, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuGBbLk4XHI
For 20 minutes on Tuesday, May 5, the day he turned 17, Zack Clements was
clinically dead.Today he is alive with no apparent lasting effects from his ordeal.
But that’s not even the most amazing part of his story.
Whenheregainedconsciousnessthreedayslaterat Children’sMedicalCenter in
Fort Worth, Texas, Zack told his parents that he’d seen a man with a thick beard, blue
eyes and long, ruffled hair, surrounded by angels.
“I realized it was Jesus,” Zack, 17, of Brownwood, Texas, tells PEOPLE exclusively,
taking a break from playing video games at home after his second day back at school
since he was released from the hospital.
“He put his hand on my shoulder and told me that everything was going to be all
right,” he says. “It made me feel like someone was watching over me and I was going
to get through it. Since it happened, I feel like I’m a stronger person.”
The Clements were so astounded by Zack’s revelation that Teresa videotaped
her son recalling what he saw.
“He said that he saw a line of angels and in the middle was the prettiest one of
all – Jesus,” says Teresa, 39.
The family has been inundated with calls and comments – pro and con – since
93
Zack went public with his revelation in a local TV interview.
“We’ve had people say he’s lying, or that we gave him a pill before school that
day so it would look like he’d gone into cardiac arrest,” says Billy Clements, 40, who
works for an oil-rig company.
“People can argue science and logic, but they can’t argue somebody’s personal
experience,” he says. “They can’t take that away from Zack.”
A Miracle in the Making
Football endurance training had just started after school on May 5 when, with
no warning, Zack collapsed on the Warriors’ football field next to several of his
friends.
For 20 minutes, classmates, a coach and a paramedic crew performed CPR to
revive him.
“The situation was one of the gravest I’d seen,” says Gary Bay, who is principal
of the Christian high school and used to work on a volunteer ambulance crew.
“If everyone hadn’t worked on him as quickly and efficiently as they did, I’m not
sure he would have made it,” he says.
Doctors told Zack’s parents that the prognosis was grim.
“For 20 minutes, he was legally dead,” Dr. Lisa Roten, 49, a cardiologist who
helped care for Zack, confirms to PEOPLE.
“We were worried he may have suffered irreversible brain damage,” she says.
Once his heart resumed beating on its own, doctors put Zack into a medically
induced coma, lowering his body temperature to help his brain recover from the
trauma.
Roten and the rest of the medical team were astonished when Zack awakened
several days later and was fully aware of his surroundings.
The teen’s heart failed, Roten says, due to a rhythm problem, inflammation and
a slightly abnormal coronary artery.
“He is very lucky,” she says. “So often, people remain in a coma after something
like this and don’t wake up.”
As for Zack’s Jesus story, Roten says she believes him.
“As a society, we don’t like to look at what’s going to happen to us after we die,”
she says.
94
“It’s an uncomfortable thing,” she says. “But somebody who is not clinically
dead or has not been in that state cannot say what Zack did or did not see. He is
somebody who, for 20 minutes, didn’t have a heartbeat.”
A Grateful Family
Twoandahalfweekslater,theClementsarepreparingtohostabelatedbirthday
party for Zack in June, with an open invitation to everyone who came together to
save the lanky teen’s life.
“It’s a miracle – there’s no other word,” says Teresa, a receptionist.
“Everyone is just amazed that he made it,” she says. “His doctors told me they
normally don’t work on people for that long. After a certain amount of time, if they
don’t have a pulse, they call it.”
Now back to his normal school routine, except for sports (further tests will be
needed before he gets clearance), Zack wears a defibrillator vest that will deliver a
shock if it detects a life-threatening heart rhythm.
And Zack believes that what he saw during the 20 minutes he was clinically
dead is one reason he’ll be able to blow out 17 candles on his birthday cake.
“I’m just really thankful to everybody who pulled together to help me that day,”
he says.
“It’s kind of overwhelming,” he says. “I guess you could say that the whole
experience has made me a more humble person. I’m happy to be here.”

THE TESTIMONY OF HANNA KRISTANTO
Picture resource:
Kristanto Hanna, 21 Days Daniel Prayer & Fasting, IFGF,
http://www.ifgf.org/uncategorized/21-days-daniel-prayer-fasting/
Hanna Kristanto is the younger sister of the late Johannes Oentoro, one of
the founders of Pelita Harapan University in Tangerang, Indonesia. Hanna serves
as a pastor at IFGF GISI Jakarta church. At that time on May 22, 2012 Hanna was
found face down unconscious and without a pulse on her desk. Hanna was rushed
to Siloam Hospital by her younger brother, Reverend Jimmy Oentoro. Hanna was
immediately treated intensively in the Intensive Care Unit and in a coma for about
4 hours.
His family panicked and cried seeing Hanna’s condition, but instead Hanna was
actually enjoying the beauty of heaven and did not want to return to earth. There
he met his brother who had died a year earlier, Johannes Oentoro, and his father
who had died ten years earlier. Hanna wrote this experience in a book entitled “3
Hours in Heaven”. His testimony can also be seen in an interview that can be seen
on youtube.
Hanna said that when she was unconscious, she felt she was somewhere but she
did not know where she was. At that time he felt a pull on her body. Her legs were
pulled by someone invisible. Hanna struggled to get away from the pull but she
felt powerless and could only shout “Jesus help!” In her distress she later saw his
97
brother, Johannes Oentoro, and his father who had died. His brother tried to help
him. He said, “We must seek help.” Then Hanna saw someone coming. That person
was big. When the big man came, the person who pulled Hanna’s leg immediately
released his grip. Hanna didn’t know who pulled her leg, but she thought maybe it
was a Devil.
The big man who helped Hanna then picked her up and brought her to a very
nice house. The house was extremely beautiful and Hanna thought the owner of
this house must be very rich. Hanna was on the floor and saw that the floor of
the house was very shiny like there was water. When Hanna touched the floor, she
found out that the floor was not wet. Hanna wanted to know who the owner of the
house is. Hanna held the man’s robe to help her up but she could not see His face.
His robes were white and like a king’s clothes. Hanna asked, “Whose house is this?”
but there was no answer.
Then Hanna walked alone to surround the house. She saw the walls like reliefs
made of various kinds of extraordinarily beautiful rocks. Hanna was amazed to look
around the house. Then Hanna heard a very grand choir. Hanna asked, “Who is this
singing?” But there was no answer. The song is like a very beautiful hymn. Then
Hanna walked farther and heard the children’s choir.
Then Hanna arrived at an extraordinarily beautiful garden. The grass was very
smooth and green. Hanna ran around in a garden arranged with beautiful flowers.
Hanna had never seen such a beautiful flower before. The flowers were big. The
colors of the flowers were so beautiful and radiant, incomparable to the flowers
on earth. The sky was feeled so close to beautiful colors and not dazzling. The
atmosphere there was so peaceful. Hanna went around the garden and touched the
flowers there in surprise. Then he sat down and said to herself, “Wow, it’s nice to
live here, it’s amazing.”
In the park Hanna did not see anyone else, but the big man followed behind him
all the time. Hanna ran around in the park and then she found a river. The river was
so clear and beautiful. From the river came a song of praise that made the heart
truly feel joy. Hanna sat on the edge of the river thinking, “This is amazing.”
Suddenly the big man tapped Hanna’s shoulder while saying, “Hanna, it’s time
to go home.” “Why should I go home?”, said Hanna. The person said, “You must go
home because many are waiting for you.” “No, no,” Hanna said and she ran quickly.
But that person was suddenly behind Hanna. He was always close behind Hanna
but Hanna still could not see His face. Hanna said, “I don’t want to go home. Why
do I have to go home? “ “Yes, you must go home.” “Please, I want to stay here,” said
Hanna. Hanna felt just arrived there, she was not satisfied exploring the park. She
98
argued again, “Why should I go home?” The man said again, “You must go home
because many are waiting for you!”
Hanna talked to that man was like talking to a friend. When He to Hanna to go
home, She saw millions of human hands and some of them said, “Hanna please go
home.” Hanna was surprised and thinks whose hand it is? Then the man said that it
was the hands of her friends. Hanna said that it must be wrong because she didn’t
have as many friends as those people.
Then Hanna ran again and then she sat down. The man said again that Hannah
had to go home. Hanna asked him what she should told the people when she
returned home. He said, “You tell them!” “Tell them what?” said Hanna. “Tell them
that many of them are fake. Tell them that I am Yes and Amen. Tell them to be truly
to Me. “ At that time Hannah realized that the person was Jesus. He spoke behind
Hanna. Hanna could see his clothes, but he still couldn’t see His face. Then Hanna
said, then why don’t you speak directly to them? “ He answered, “No, you must.”
At that time Hannah became convinced that the one who spoke to her was not an
angel but Jesus Christ himself who gave her the command to do.
Hanna still tried to avoid His command. She ran again away from Jesus because
she did not want to be told to go home. Then Jesus suddenly was behind Hanna
again.AtthatmomentHannasuddenlysawherhusband’sface.Hannawassurprised
and said to her husband, “Why are you here?” Her husband replied, “Yes, please go
home! You left not saying goodbye yet. “ When Hanna was still thinking about it, she
suddenly heard of her husband crying, like a child, which made her bear no heart.
His crying really made Hanna touched and made her cry too, but Hanna still didn’t
want to go home. Then Jesus said, “You go home first. Later when the time comes,
I’ll tell you when you can come back here. “ It was God’s promise to Hanna that
she wanted to go home. Then Jesus reached out His hand and took Hanna. At that
moment Hanna returned to her body on earth.
Currently Hanna Kristanto serves as a pastor in the IFGF GISI church Jakarta.
She also serves as an apostolic team at IFGF GISI headquarters in Tangerang.
Hanna’s activities can be seen on the IFGF GISI church website at www.ifgf.org

Note :
Glenn Hermann, who studied Christian apologetics, chronicled George’s story in a
book called “Celestial Traveler.” Hermann said that while he was initially skeptical
of George’s story, he decided to investigate. He spent about two years researching
what George said happened to him. He traveled the region, talking to people who
knew George before and after the accident. He interviewed most of the leaders in
the village and he had enough tangibe evidence that he was convinced it did happen.

THE TESTIMONY OF ABRAHAM ‘IPLY’ GEORGE
Picture resource:
Herman, Glenn, Celestial Traveler : Sensational New Book About One Man’s
Journey Into The Hereafter, Celestial Traveler, http://celestialtraveler.org/
Manokotak, Alaska-Nov,29,2005. I woke up that morning and had coffee. It
seemed to be a normal day – nothing seemed out of the ordinary. After lunch, I got
my snowmobile and sled ready and took off. I have a special wood-hauling sled that
I made. While on my way, I met two brothers from the village who said they were
also going wood-hauling. But before we went on our way to the wood forest, we
smoked marijuana first and got high.
After getting to our area, we began cutting trees, and soon we were gathering
them to load them up. I asked the younger of the two brothers if he would make a
run into Dillingham – for it was close by – to buy me a bottle of alcohol. He agreed
and I gave him money.
We followed the trail home and came to one of the creeks. I headed down the
embankment of that creek. On my way down, my snowmobile abruptly stopped.
The right ski had slid under an upside down, u-shaped branch that was strong
enough to stop the snowmobile suddenly. I quickly looked behind me. I could see
one of the brothers right behind me hitting the brakes on his snowmobile, trying to
102
avoid hitting my sled full of logs – which was coming at me! I remember getting hit
by the sled. I tried to jump off my snowmobile but the sled – extremely heavy with
logs – slammed into my back with such force and violence that it crushed me. I was
pinned helplessly against my snowmobile. I could not move and began to feel pain
in my body.
The brothers jumped out of their snowmobiles and rushed to my aid almost
immediately. In order to get the sled off, they had to off-load the logs until they were
able to lift it. In the meantime, I began to experience blackouts, going in and out of
consciousness. I also begin to vomit lots of blood.
Finally I was brought to the airport & I made it to the Dillingham hospital. The
doctorstherex-rayedmeandI couldhearthemspeaking –theysaid,“He’sgonna die
from his injuries before the medevac arrives.” According to their x-rays, I had three
shattered ribs. My pelvis was broken in four places. I had four crushed vertebrae.
My spine was bent and severed. My liver and spleen were torn by a broken rib, and
a lung was punctured by a broken rib. Needless to say, I was bleeding internally.
While at Kanakanak Hospital, a Russian man came and prayed for me. He said,
“Lord, if it be your will, EXTEND HIS LIFE.” The next thing I knew, I was on the
medevac to Anchorage on a Learjet. There were (four) paramedics or EMTs on the
plane, and they were monitoring me. My blood pressure continued dropping.
Finally, my heart stopped. I had a cardiac arrest and I passed out. It felt like
I fell asleep. Somehow, I got up and saw my body lying on the stretcher and the
paramedics working on me. I was having an out-of-body experience. Yet, I could
still see, hear, smell, taste and feel – I had all my senses even though I could see my
body lying on the stretcher.
I could see them using what I thought were battery-jumper cables on me, and
I could see my body and chest rise when they used it on me. But the heart monitor
screen only showed a flat line. The defibrillator did not work – I did not respond.
Then I heard another EMT say, “Put down the time when he died.” After they wrote
it down, an EMT said, “Let’s try it one more time.” And they used the battery cables
on me again, and my body jumped once more. This time it appeared to work – my
heart started again.
THE ASCENT INTO HEAVEN
But then, the brightest, brilliant LIGHT – a figure of a Man – was standing by
me on the right side! He was FILLED with LOVE, JOY and PEACE. He spoke in Yup’ik
and he talked to me in a gentle way that filled me with a gentle, tingling feeling. He
103
asked me if I wanted to go to the place where the saved souls go.
The place that he brought me to was filled with God’s glory. I saw gold streets
below my feet. Even the ground was Full of LIGHT and there was no Shadow.
When He brought me up, I looked for a sun or a light but there was no such light. I
wondered where the light was coming from. He, Jesus, said, “I AM THE LIGHT OF
THE WORLD!”
I saw a lot of saved souls from all different nationalities with this brilliant
LIGHT. The saved souls had white garments – even the angels had white garments.
And there were only young people. There were no old people. I recognised lots of
saved souls. I saw people from Akiachak and Manokotak.
Isawthosefrommyfamily:MyUppa,Grandma,aunts,uncles,mywife’srelatives
and ones that I never met before. I’d wondered in my thoughts, “Who’s that?” Jesus
knew my every thought and told me their names. “This is Evon John, and (the names
of a Mr. & Mrs. Minesta), and Andrewski Gloko,” and so on. I realized that they look
so young with brilliant bright and smooth skins, and they were dressed in white
robes. Their robes had a form with the brightest, brilliant and purest “fog” that
moved on their robes. I saw the ones who died of old age, but here they were all
young, about 33 years old. I even saw a woman who died of an old age, but here in
heaven she was a young woman. I saw another woman who died as an old woman,
but here in heaven she was also a young woman! I asked, “How come are they so
young?” Jesus replied, “When they were young, they accepted me. I am the Way, the
Truth and the Life.”
Men and women had black hair and full sets of hair. Women had long, wavy hair
and a gentle wind seemed to be blowing on their hair. Some had wings and some
not wearing the brightest, brilliant, and purest white robe made of fog. They said in
heaven we would no longer be married, but live as brother and sister.
Jesus would say, “Look.” Each time I looked, my eyes opened. I even saw many
little children, and angels with wings flying around them but some had none. The
feather touch of the angels was gentle and the Brightest of the LIGHT on my right
told me these babies were the ones from miscarriages, abortions & stillborns. But
their parents, mothers who are saved, will recognize them and the babies will
recognize their parents and moms, I was told. That place is so wonderful. Jesus
made that place for the saved souls.
104
THE DESCENT INTO HELL
Then the Brightest LIGHT asked, “Do you want to see where the unsaved souls
live?” But I had no authority or control over my spirit and soul; whatever the Lord
spoke, my whole being obeyed His voice!
Then Jesus and I turned around from the saved souls, and
went to a different place. But we did not walk – rather, we began to
glide downwards. As soon as we began descending into darkness, I
began to smell an awful smell and I gasped for air. It seemed toxic!
We came to a complete darkness but I could hear shouting and gnashing of teeth. I
could hear millions upon millions of people even before we reached the bottomless
pit and outer darkness. I heard countless people in different foreign languages, but
I could also hear voices in Yup’ik, too. There were people gnashing their teeth and
wailing and screaming in torment. There were also Christians who disobeyed the
Lord and became as the UNPROFITABLE SERVANT who is thrown into the OUTER
DARKNESS (Matthew 22:13; 25:30). They and the people who died in their sins
were crying, “Give me another chance!” There are different levels of Hell, and the
worst of the sinners are tormented in the worst way. Isiah 66:24: “Their worms will
not die, nor will their fire be quenched.”
THE 3 MEN IN HELL
The Lord showed me three different Yup’ik speaking men!
TheGloryoftheLordshowedmethefirstYup’ik-speakingman.TheGloryoftheLord
showedmethelostsoul,andwormswerecomingoutofhiseyes,nose,mouth,andears.
The man said in Yup’ik, “This is no place for me; I am tired of being thirsty. I am
suffering and tired of being tormented. Why am I here? Give me another chance!”
He said this three times.
The Lord answered him after the third time. “When you were on Earth I gave
you many chances. I had my arms wide open to receive you. I called you by NAME,
but you didn’t listen to my WORDS and my VOICE. You chose to enjoy the pleasures
of sins, drugs, alcohol and earthly pleasures. You chose not to go to church and
repent and live for me. You will be here for a long time until the Judgment Day: Then
you will be judged according to your works and thrown into the lake of fire, where
the demons will torment you forever!”
The Lord then showed me another Yup’ik-speaking man. The Glory of the Lord
showed me the lost soul, and worms were coming out of his eyes, nose, mouth
and ears.The man said, “Don’t look at me – don’t come near me – I am ashamed of
105
myself! This is no place for me. I am tired of being thirsty; I am suffering, tired of
being tormented. Why am I here? Give me another chance!” He said this three times.
The Lord answered him after the third time. “When you were on Earth, you
drank alcohol. Before your time came, and before you repented and came to me to
be my servant, you took your own life and committed suicide! You took your life
that does not belong to you; you cheated me by taking your own life. Here you will
be forever until the Judgment Day, and then you will be thrown into the Lake of Fire
where the demons will torment you forever!”
There were many people in hell, many souls: They were all too late and without
Jesus.
The Lord showed me a third Yup’ik man, who was a preacher. The Glory of the
Lord showed me the lost soul, and worms were coming out of his eyes, nose, mouth
and ears. The man said, “This is no place for me, I am tired of being thirsty; I am
suffering, tired of being tormented. Why am I here? Give me another chance! I have
been serving the Lord and ministering as a preacher all my life. Why am I here?” He
said this three times.
The Lord answered after the third time. “You are right when you said you served
me all your life on Earth, but you hated one person and when you hated that one
person, you hated me. Here you will be forever until the Judgment Day, and then
you will be thrown into the lake of fire and the demons will torment you forever!”
—Matthew6:14-15says,“Forifyouforgivementheirtrespasses,yourHeavenly
Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither
will your Father forgive your trespasses!” — Matthew 23:13 also says, “Then the
king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside into the
outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”
Then, while we were in Hell, the Lord showed me falling souls. These people did
not have Jesus. Those who die (fall asleep) without Jesus will wake up in hell. Even
right now, as we speak, people are falling into Hell! Those worms in Hell will never
die. The worms are there right now and upon those poor souls!
After a while, in my mind I said I didn’t want to remain in Hell anymore. I was
scared and frightened. I thought, “Am I going to be here, too? Am I going to be stuck
here, too? Am I going to spend eternity here?” And the Voice, the Brightest LIGHT
told me, as if he read my mind, “I am going to take you back!”
106
THE RETURN TO HEAVEN & EARTH
Jesus brought me back to the place where the saved souls go. He brought me
back to heaven, up to the brightest place where I met with my relatives again. The
Lord stood me next to my Dad, who said, “It is not your time – you have to go back.”
After spending some time in heaven, the Lord told me He was bringing me back.
And when Jesus and I were going down, He said to me, “Tell my children, I love
them. Tell them there is a Heaven and Hell. Tell them I am the Way, the Truth, and
the Life. Tell them no one comes to the Father except through me. Tell my children
I am coming soon.” He said this to me three times.
I didn’t want to go back. I wanted to stay in the comfortable place. The Lord said, “If
you don’t tell my children and my people, I will throw you into the outer darkness,
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, and there you will suffer for
eternity and the fire is not quenched! Tell my people and children that HEAVEN
AND HELL ARE SO REAL !!”
When he said that, I got scared and it gave me the chills! When he was bringing
me back, I said I didn’t know how to speak in front of people. Jesus said, “I will take
you to places you never went. I will help you when you speak about heaven and hell.
Those who are spirit-filled will be your friends. Tell my children I love them. Tell
them there’s a heaven and hell. Tell them I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. Tell
them there’s no way to the Father except through Jesus.”
As Lord was bringing me closer to my body, I could see the doctors unplugging
the cords of the life support from my body. Then I heard many voices of angels
singing a Christmas song. They were singing “Silent Night, Holy Night” in the most
beautiful way I have ever heard.
When I touched my body, I came to. I could not hear the singing any longer. I
suddenly felt the pain of my injuries. I could feel the tubes in my mouth and nose.
I was going to tell the Brightest, Brilliant LIGHT on my right to bring me back to
heaven, but He was gone. I wanted to stay where LOVE, JOY and PEACE – and the
Peaceful, Brightest Brilliant LIGHT – was and stay there!
It was Christmas Day in 2005, and doctors at the Alaska Native Medical Center
were unplugging my life support system. They said, “He will not survive.” I had
developed pneumonia in my good lung – the other lung was torn and useless from
being damaged during the accident – and it was ending my life. They let my family
in to see me for the last time. I was given last ministries. I called the preacher’s
name and he came back. He was glad to see me alive.
107
Then smoke began to swirl around me, and it swirled in my room for three days.
The Spirit of the Lord, as a bright fog and the most beautiful smell, was circling
above my bed. I asked the doctors and nurses tending me, “Why is there smoke?”
I asked if there was a fire. They said there was no smoke or fire. I guess only I was
seeing it. Each time I breathed in that smoke, I could feel healing taking place in
my body. I felt a tingling that started on top of my head, and as time passed, that
tingling began traveling down my body. I could feel bones moving in my body! I
could hear noises as bones were being put back in place! I began recovering. On the
second day, the doctors brought a portable x-ray in my room and re-examined me.
They saw the bones healed and could not find the injuries. They looked for the gash
in my liver and could not find it. The doctors loudly exclaimed their unbelief saying,
“THIS CAN’T BE!”
Then they brought me to physical therapy and they let me walk; I walked on
my own and praised God! On the third day of my awakening, all the pain was gone
from my body. It was Dec. 27, 2005. The doctors discharged me then, for there was
nothing wrong with me any more: THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HEALED ALL OF MY
INJURIES! I told the doctors and nurses about what I experienced and they said,
“This is real. It’s time to change our lives.”
MINISTRY
Since his recovery, Abraham George has been traveling to many places
witnessing for the Lord Jesus Christ and the wonderful miracle of healing God has
bestowed upon him. During his witnessing, signs and wonders followed Abraham,
just as signs and wonders followed Jesus’ apostles and others who gave their lives
to Jesus and witnessed about him. Abraham says, “The world is not getting better.
Even the weather is of the last days. All the messages that Jesus gave me are Biblical.
When I read the bible, I see what the Lord was saying to me.” Get right with God.
Make Jesus Christ your Lord and Saviour, pick up your cross and follow Him. There
is a Heaven to be won and Hell to shun.
***
Molly Dischner wrote additional information about Abraham ‘Iply’ George like
the following:
George was raised in a Christian household, but left that faith as he grew older.
His accident came just a few days after he was released from his third round of
108
substance abuse treatment at Jake’s Place, in Dillingham.
He described himself as a full-bore alcoholic, a wild and rebellious man. The
day of his accident, he was drinking alcohol while out collecting firewood. His sled
turned over, and he was severely injured; the men he was with took him back to
Manokotak. Eventually he was transported to Dillingham and then Anchorage for
medical care.
After he was healed, George believed God had saved him so that he could return
and spread the gospel. He started by swearing off alcohol for good.
“I would have been killed by alcohol,” George said. “I was a regular drunk in
Dillingham. After fishing I’d drink and ended up in jail. That was my life. And after
he gave me that out-of-body experience, from then on, I never had a drop on, ever
since 2005.”
George said he believes he was brought back to share the gospel and tell people
that Jesus is coming back to earth soon. Now, George travels throughout the state
sharing his story, wherever church or community members invite him. For some,
it’s a little hard to believe, but after a decade of remaining steadfast, more and more
are finding truth in it.
And his message has done more than just save souls. Manokotak Mayor Melvin
Andrew said he’s also caused change in their community, and beyond.
“The way it’s benefitted Manokotak is to see a person change from one side to
the other, and that the use of alcohol and drugs and crime doesn’t pay. People can
change from what they are now.”
Andrew said crime decreased after George came back to the community healed,
and a few others had also changed their lives and gotten sober. Andrew had a long
history with George, which made it hard to accept his story at first. But today, he
said, they are close friends and work together to encourage people to change their
lives.
“He was the town trouble-maker, to make it plain and easy to explain,” Andrew
said. “And I was a village public safety officer during that time. I had contact with
him in my official capacity as a VPSO many times, and on some occasions I’d have to
arrest him. During those confrontations, we developed an animosity toward each
other. But then after his accident, lo and behold, Mr. Abraham George changed. He
was no longer the town drunk, but the complete opposite.”
Andnow,anAnchoragemanhaswrittenabookchroniclingGeorge’sexperience.
Glenn Hermann, who studied Christian apologetics, chronicled George’s story in
a recently released book called “Celestial Traveler.” Hermann said that while he
109
was initially skeptical of George’s story, he decided to investigate. He spent about
two years researching what George said happened to him. He traveled the region,
talking to people who knew George before and after the accident.
“I’ve interviewed most of the leaders in the village, and they are all convinced,”
Hermann said. “...After about a year and a half I had enough tangible evidence
that I was convinced it did happen, and I wound up writing this book about his
experiences.” Hermann said that while the story is a powerful religious testimony,
it’s also a good message for those struggling to get sober, and the book includes
stories from those who have changed their lives after hearing Abraham’s story.
Andrew agreed. “It is a powerful message,” Andrew said. “And I’m sure it isn’t
just in Manokotak, but in the region and in the state, that people have heard his
message and may have changed their lifestyle.”

THE TESTIMONY OF DANIEL EKECHUKWU
Daniel Ekechukwu and his wife, Nneka
Picture resource :
Servant, David, The Resurrection of Pastor Daniel Ekechukwu, Bible Probe,
Accessed 10th
March 2020, http://www.bibleprobe.com/ekechukwu.htm
Daniel Ekechukwu, a pastor in Nigeria, died in a car accident and was taken
to heaven and hell by two large angels. This testimony is important because it
highlights the importance of forgiveness. Had God not given him mercy, Daniel
would have had to stay in hell because he did not forgive his wife prior to death.
Pastor Daniel Ekechukwu appeared to be completely in control as he drove his
car through the busy streets to his home in Lagos, Nigeria. There was nothing to
show that he was boiling with rage at his wife. The Lord Jesus intervened in Daniel’s
life to bring him back to reality. Daniel related the story from his home in Lagos.
It was Christmas time, and my family always celebrates the birth of Jesus with
our family and friends. I arrived home a few days before Christmas with a goat
for my father. I had a quarrel with my wife, Nneka, on the previous Thursday. On
Thursday night she knocked on my bedroom door, but I refused to open the door
to her. The next morning she knocked again on my door, and again I did not answer.
As I came out of the room, she said “Good morning, Daddy,” but I ignored her, and
would not talk to her. I then left the house, as she had offended me. I was very angry
with her. I drove my car away from the house without even seeing my son on his
bike, and nearly ran over our pet dog. I was told later that my son had asked his
113
mother where I was, and she said that I would be home soon.
I was going to deliver the goat to my father in Owerri. When I arrived, I saw my
dad and said to him, “Hello Dad, I have a goat for you.” I took the goat out of the car
and gave it to him. Then I climbed into the car to return home. The sun was setting
on the way back and I was anxious to arrive home as soon as possible, so I was
driving faster than normal. As I passed a truck, the car seemed to be sluggish and
unresponsive to the controls. I was traveling down quite a steep hill, and was about
to turn into another dirt road. I applied the brake, but nothing happened. Even
when I pumped the brakes nothing happened. The other cars in the road hooted,
and pedestrians shouted at me, but there was nothing I could do. I crashed into a
palm tree. The whole thing was weird. I seemed to see things happening in slow
motion, and then there was darkness.
My wife, Nneka did not realize that I had been involved in an accident until she
saw the people carrying me on their shoulders down the road. “The pastor is dead,”
they were screaming. She knew that they were screaming about me. She went to
the scene of the accident and then learned that I was not dead, but in a very serious
condition. Some of the people had taken me to the local hospital where I was rushed
into the Intensive Care Unit. She travelled to the hospital, where she found me.
I insisted on being taken to my family doctor at Owerri. Nneka also asked the
surgeon to move me to our family doctor. Nneka was advised that I was not well
enough to travel or to make decisions, and that I may die if I left the hospital.
Nneka then signed a discharge authority to remove me from the hospital at
her own risk. She arranged for me to be taken in an ambulance at high speed to
the clinic in Owerri, where our private doctor practiced. I was in great pain during
the journey, and I passed out. As the ambulance continued along at high speed, I
saw two angels who lifted me up out of the ambulance by my shoulders. Nneka did
not know anything about this. Suddenly the two angels left, and I found myself in
another place with one angel.
The angel said to me, “Daniel, I have a lot to show you.” He showed me a place
where a multitude of white figures was gathered. They were pure white, and their
bodies seemed to glow with a radiant light. I thought that I was seeing a gathering
of angels because they all appeared similar.
The ambulance arrived at the clinic with my body. A doctor from the clinic
checked my body for vital signs. Since he could find no vital signs, he declared that
I was dead. Nneka was given a death certificate by the doctor, and she was told to
give it to the mortician who would take care of my corpse. He said that my body
should be moved to my own mortuary. Nneka however insisted, “No, my husband is
114
not dead. He cannot leave me and die like this.”
The angel said that the gathering was not a gathering of angels, but a gathering
of the saints. There were some subtle differences between the angels and the saints
that I noticed. Their colour was pure brilliant white. The angels had wings, but the
saints did not. The saints there were worshipping God with one voice and raised
their hands as they were singing. I heard the sound of many instruments, and their
sounds were like nothing I had ever heard before. I longed to join in the singing but
the angel would not allow me to. The angel said to me “Daniel, don’t go. I have a lot
to show you. Take this file and record everything you see.”
The many people that I saw were clothed in light, and shone like the sun. They
were the source of light there. There was another light beaming down upon them,
and they were looking at that light. But I could not look at that light because it hurt
my eyes.
On the 30th November 2001 my body was taken to the mortuary. Darlington
Manu, the local mortician, arranged for the burial and discussed the details with
my family and friends.
Exactly a year previously Nneka was praying after a very bad day. Whilst she
was in prayer, the Lord had given her a word from the Bible. She read a verse, in
Hebrews 11:35, that reads, “women received their dead raised to life again.”
After my death Nneka meditated on the words, “women received their dead
raised to life again”. Whilst meditating on these words, the thought occurred to her
that although her husband was dead, he would be raised to life, as in the Bible.
Nneka had an impression that she should take my body to Reinhard Bonnke’s
crusade, and that I would be raised back to life.
The angel said to me, “Let us visit the mansions Jesus has prepared for His
people.” Immediately I was in a new place with mansions as far as the eye could see.
Nothing on Earth could compare with these mansions. Although their appearances
resembled buildings, the structures were unusual, not made of Earthly material.
The buildings seemed alive, and moving. There were flowers everywhere, and
beautiful singing and worship came from everywhere.
The angel said to me, “Jesus has finish His work, but the saints are not yet
ready. The worship you are hearing is being sung by the flowers.” I looked and saw
the flowers swaying in response to the music. It actually seemed as if they were
clapping their hands, shouting and praising God. The angel said, “The flowers are
waiting for the saints.”
Darlington Manu was in the mortuary between twelve midnight, and one
115
o’clock in the morning. He heard sounds coming from the mortuary, including
singing, praising, and the clapping of hands. He wondered what was taking place,
and decided to find out where the music was coming from.
As I was staring at the flowers singing the angel said to me, “We are going to visit
Hell. Can you see the gates of Hell?” He raised his hand, and as he brought his hand
down the gates opened with a loud noise. I could hear the crying and wailing of
many people, but could not see them. I could not see very well, because of the
darkness. However, the angel shone a light into the darkness, and then I could
see more clearly. There were many people there. But, unlike the appearances of
the people in Heaven, the appearance of these people was as it had been whilst
they were on Earth. They were from every race, culture and nationality. Everyone
seemed to be trapped in his or her own personal torment, a torment that would
go on for eternity. The people could not communicate with any of the other people
there. The sounds of crying and wailing were almost deafening. Suddenly they all
seemed to become aware of me, and started shouting to me for help. They all called
out to me only, and appeared not to see the angel.
A tormented soul shouted to me, “Please help. I am a pastor. I stole money from
church and I lied. Help me, please. I am ready to repent”. I noticed that immediately
after the pastor made that statement, the force that was tormenting him seemed to
increase. The people had flesh, but no blood, and they seemed to be on fire, but no
flames could be seen.
There was a group of people that were eating their own flesh. They would vomit
what they ate, and their flesh grew back again. This carried on in an endless cycle of
torment. I thought to myself, “This place is not good for any human being, created
by God, to go to. God did not make this place for human beings. He made this place
for the Devil and his demons. Stubborn humans who disobey God will go here, just
like the devil. This is a dangerous and a deadly place. God made it for the devil and
his demons.”
The angel said to me, “Daniel, if the book of your life was to be closed today, this
would be your portion.” This was completely shattering news to me. I said to the
angel, “No. I am a pastor. I am a child of God. I am born again. And I have preached
all over this country.”
The angel said sternly, “Enough, Daniel. On the way to the first hospital you
were asking God to forgive you. But you would not forgive your wife. Therefore
your sins have not been forgiven. It is a matter of reaping what you have sown. You
cannot show unforgiveness to your wife, and reap forgiveness from God.”
116
I realized that the judgment was true for me, because I was angry with my wife,
and I believed. God judged my heart so the angel said to me that, since I did not
forgive my wife, I was not forgiven. I was crying, and said, “See how I destroyed my
soul.” While I was shouting and crying, I was afraid, and was covered in my own
tears. I experienced panic because of the horror of Hell. If God wanted to send me
to Hell, then nothing could prevent Him. While we were discussing this thousands
of people were being sent to Hell.
Nneka told me that she had decided that she must take a step of faith, to make
sure that I was brought back to life. She told my father that my family should take my
body to the Reinhardt Bonnke meeting. But my father did not agree to this request,
and dismissed her request to remove the body from the mortuary.
Meanwhile on the other side of the town things were working miraculously
in favour of Nneka. Darlington Manu contacted my father, Lawrence Eke Imubwa.
He told my father to remove the corpse they had brought to the mortuary. He said
that he had seen some unusual signs in the mortuary. He did not know the reason
for these signs, and did not want these experiences to trouble his conscience later,
if he did nothing about the situation. He told my father to remove the body from
his mortuary. My father asked why, and Darlington Manu replied, “Because things
happened last night. I heard singing and music. You must take Daniel’s body to the
Reinhardt Bonnke meeting.”
Nneka and my father then removed my body from the mortuary. They dressed
my body, and put my body inside the coffin. Darlington Manu travelled with them
when they left Owerri and went to Onitsha, where Reinhardt Bonnke was holding
a crusade. My dressed body was place in a white coffin that they had bought, and
the coffin was loaded into a hired ambulance. Darlington Manu had agreed to go, in
addition, to be a witness of my body coming back to life. When they arrived at the
crusade the security guards prevented them from going into the crusade area.
Nneka told me that some people had been very unpleasant to her. She explained,
“My husband, Daniel, is a man of God. He has had an accident and has died.” Nneka
asked permission to take my body into the meeting, so that Reinhardt Bonnke could
pray for me, and bring me back to life. The security guards refused them entry into
the premises, thinking they might have a bomb in the coffin. The procession was
redirected to a room at the back of the church, and my body was taken out of the
coffin and was laid on a table. People started praying over my body, for my body to
come back to life.
Theangelsaidthathewassending mebacktotheworldtowarnthisgeneration.
As people prayed, my heart began to beat. They all continued praying, and my
117
breathing gradually improved, but my body was still stiff with rigor mortis.
I saw myself being held up by lots of people. I was wearing only my trousers.
They dressed me in my clothes. There was a crowd of people of more than two
thousand. I looked around, and everywhere people were shouting and crying.
Some were praising God. I could not understand what was happening. I saw hands
grabbing me. They later told me that I jumped up out of the coffin. I could not
understand what was happening. When I went to Heaven it seemed to me that I was
there for no more than fifteen minutes. I could not understand why these people
said I had been dead for three days. I had experienced no day, and no night. To me, it
seemed that I had only experienced a short time in Heaven. I asked my wife, “What
is happening?’ In reply, she said I should keep quiet until we arrived at the house.
They brought me back to the house with my wife on the 2nd December 2001.
When we were alone in the bedroom I asked my wife, “What is happening? What
about the coffin and the time in the mortuary?” Then my wife looked at my body,
where the mortician had injected chemicals, and said, “Daddy, did you know you
were in the mortuary for three days?”
Nneka showed me my death certificate. She told me what had happened after
they had taken me from the ambulance to the hospital, where the doctor confirmed
that I had died. They had used their equipment to check my vital signs. The doctor
confirmed he had checked my heartbeat, the pupils of my eyes, and everything
else. After checking all my vital signs he confirmed that I was indeed dead. He then
gave them a certificate, on which it was indicated that my family should remove my
body to the mortuary. Nneka showed me my death certificate, where it clearly says,
“Demise. For removal to mortuary.”

Additional information written by David Servant :
Daniel said there is no earthly way to describe what he saw. The mansion had
no apparent end to its height or width. It continually moved, and each room also
revolved in some manner. It was made of something that was transparent like
glass, and the floors appear to be made of light. Daniel didn’t see anybody in the As
amazingasthestoryofhisdeathandresurrectionis,whatpastorDanielexperienced
after his death is even more amazing. To him, what he experienced between his
death and resurrection could have taken only fifteen minutes, even though he was
physically dead for almost two days. After he was lifted from his body by the two
118
angels in the ambulance, he soon found himself momentarily alone, but soon joined
by a different angel. Daniel stated that if he was confused about something that he
saw or experienced, or if he had a question in his mind, this angel immediately gave
him the answer. This angel first told him that they were going to Paradise. There
was no time expended in getting anywhere the angel took him. As soon as the angel
said they were going to Paradise, they were there.
Daniel stood with the angel and watched a multitude of worshipping people
who were dressed in sparkling white garments. He immediately thought they were
angels, but the escorting angel told him that they were human beings who, “while
they lived on earth, served God and had their faith focused on Christ Jesus and lived
righteously.” These people were all ageless and raceless. That is, none appeared to
be young or middle-aged or elderly, and none had any racial distinctives in their
appearance. All were focused on a very bright light, and all worshipped in perfect
unison. They would all lift their hands at once and bow at once “as if a sort of
electronic device was activating them.” (This same phenomenon was described to
my wife by an elderly Haitian pastor who died for a short time, but was sent back
to earth to finish his work.)
Daniel did notice one man who looked elderly among the multitude, and the
thought occurred to him that perhaps that man was God, but the escorting angel
immediately corrected him. The man was father Abraham.
Daniel longed to join the worshippers, but the angel told him that there were
other things Daniel needed to see. He told Daniel they would next go to see Jesus’
promise to His followers, the mansion He had prepared for those whom “He would
find righteous on the last day.” Immediately they were there.
Daniel said there is no earthly way to describe what he saw. The mansion had
no apparent end to its height or width. It continually moved, and each room also
revolved in some manner. It was made of something that was transparent like glass,
and the floors appear to be made of light. Daniel didn’t see anybody in the great
mansion, but heard beautiful singing. Wondering where the music was coming
from, the angel immediately pointed him to the many flowers around the mansion.
When Daniel looked at them more closely, they were moving and swaying and
singing praise to God!

THE TESTIMONY OF CARL KNIGHTON
Picture resource:
Cgman, Carl Knighton Vision of The Lake of Fire, Helltruth.Blogspot, http://
helltruth.blogspot.co.id/2014/01/carl-knighton-overdose-and-his-vision.html
Carl Knighton knows what hell is like because he says he went there after he
accidentally overdosed on a drug called Valium.
“Like the bible says you are in torment,” says Carl.
Even though it happened more than twenty years ago Carl was able to draw
pictures of what he says he encountered in hell.
Carl remembers as he shows drawings, “The one in the middle is trying to get
out of the fire but there’s no way they can get out. There’s no hope for them. There’s
no way of escape for them.”
Carl grew up in a Christian home where he had been taught that heaven and
hell were real places. Even as a child, he was sensitive to the things of God.
“I always felt the presence of God. I’ve seen angels of God at a young age and
that let me know that God was with me.”
After high school, Carl joined the army and married. Both his marriage and his
military career were short lived.
Carl says, “Platoon leader meaning Platoon sergeant and squad leader would
121
come to me and say, ’You’re not doing your job and you should be doing better than
this. And you’re not going to ever make the next rank. And you know your career is
going to end.’ So I got really frustrated.”
Carl decided it was time to get out of the army – by going AWOL. He hitch hiked
to Ohio to see an old friend. He then went on a two-week drug binge. One night Carl
went to a crack house in the worst part of Columbus, Ohio.
“You could smell the stench of the crack cocaine. You could smell the stench of
the marijuana. People were high and laying all across the floors.”
Carl smoked some crack and started drinking alcohol and using other drugs.
But he says he believes it was the last pill he took that sent him on a journey to hell.
Carl remembers, “And I took that Valium and before I knew it I fell off the couch
onto the floor. It was pitch black dark. I began to quiver. I began to have the shakes.
And I began going down and down and down like a deep pit and I start smelling the
stench of hell. It’s the most rottenness thing that you could ever smell in your life. In
fact, you can’t even imagine it. I began to fill a tugging and pulling like the bible says
the demons tug and nag at you. They were calling my name. ‘We got you. We got
you. We got you. You belong to us now.’ I saw souls. Lost souls that were in torment
in the lake of fire. They were crying and calling on God. They were hopeless. And I
called on the Lord, ‘Jesus. Jesus. Help me Jesus. Help me Jesus.’ And soon as I called
on his name. I saw the hand of God snatch me out of hell and my spirit went back
into my body.”
Carl says that he was in hell for more than half an hour.
“I was shaking and trembling and I turned my head to the right and they said I
was dead. And they said it was 30 to 35 minutes but I know that was a loving God
that loved me so much.”
Three days later, Carl returned to Ft. Eustis, Virginia to face the consequences
of going AWOL. He was demoted and was confined to the barracks for one month.
During that time alone he completely surrendered his life to Jesus Christ.
“I immediately asked the Lord to forgive me and I repented and put those sins
behind me. I went forward in God. I really gave my life back to Christ after that,”
says Carl.
Today Carl is married again. He’s on a mission: to tell as many people as he can
about the reality of heaven and hell.
“God loved me so much that he gave me a second chance. And I’m here to tell
the story not a story but a true testimony of how awesome God is if people will only
122
listen. And don’t take God for granted. Don’t throw your life away. Accept Jesus as
your savior. “

The testimony of Dr George Rodonaia was written by Dr Maurice Rawlings in his
book “To Hell and Back”. This is a prologue from Dr Maurice Rawlings:
Dr. George Rodonaia, a young Russian fellow, very intelligent. He came with a Ph.D
and an M.D, but had trouble with KGB. He couldn’t get out of Russia. In fact when
he tried to get out of Russia, he was purposely run down by a KGB agent, who drove
on the sidewalk in order to run him over. This is how he died and where his story
begins.

THE TESTIMONY OF DR GEORGE RODONAIA
Picture resource:
Rawlings, Maurice, To Hell and Back, Divine Revelations,
http://www.divinerevelations.info/documents/rawlings/dr_rawlings_near_
death_experiences2.htm
As a psychiatrist and a neuropathologist, for me God never existed. I never
believed in God. I never believed in the Bible. I never thought about God, the Bible
or divinity. In 1976, I was 20 years old, I was already a doctor working in Georgia,
Russia.
I met a lady from Texas. I tried to leave the country many times. But I didn’t
have much help. This lady tried to help me and I got in big trouble with the KGB. I
worked on “idenotintriphosper”, it is a neuron transmitter in our brain. With the
conjunction of “Oxitocin”, I discovered several things.
I was an important scientist and KGB didn’t want me to go so they decided to
kill me. That is how I got into another dimension of my life.
I was standing on the sidewalk, ready to depart to NY, waiting for cab, when a
car on the sidewalk hit me. I flew in the air 10 meters, and then the car ran over
me. My friends and relative took me to the hospital. The hospital staff, friends of
mine and 2 other professors declared me dead. On Friday night, they put me in the
morgue, in the freezer.
126
Three days later, they took me out. So on Monday morning they began my
autopsy. These3daysofbeingoutofmybody,seeingeverythingthatwashappening
around, seeing myself, my body, seeing my birth, my parents, my wife, my child,
and my friends. I saw their thoughts. I saw what they were thinking, how their
thoughts move from one dimension to another.
It was incredible experience. I was in darkness, total darkness. The darkness
was pressing. This darkness existed not beyond, but it existed within. What I want
say is that the darkness was pressing. And I was in the middle of this fear and I did
not understand why and how this darkness existed. Where was I?.
I understood that I didn’t have a body because I didn’t feel it. Then I saw a
light. I went through a little hole into that light. But the light was so powerful, so
burning. You cannot compare it to anything. No words can explain it. The light was
so burning, going through flesh. I didn’t have a body. That was the most interesting
part.
And I was scared of the light, I wanted to go into the shade to save myself from
this light. What is that light? I don’t know. It can be called the light of God, it can be
called the light of Life. But light is light and darkness is darkness. As a psychiatrist
and scientist, I did not think about that. The only thing was that I was in light.
We were not raised in God’s way. You know about the Soviet Union, we didn’t
go to church. There were people who went. But they were some kind of limited
people. We thought they didn’t know any better that there was no God. But those
3 days of being in the morgue, the freezer, changed all my life.
They begin the autopsy, and started to cut open my chest. That was the first
incision, then I opened my eyes, and they saw that my pupils were convulsing,
getting smaller. When they saw that my eyes were reacting to light they knew I was
alive. They put me back to the hospital and began resuscitation.
My lungs were collapsed for a long time so I was put on a respirator for 90 days.
My recover did not happened fast, but the life did came back. They discovered was
that the life was there during the autopsy, but not all my organs were working. It
was hard work for nine month being in recovery, it didn’t happen immediately, but
the life was there. But the doctors had to help me survive and help me to regenerate
my health and organs.
When I came back to life, a lot of different experiences had happened. I
experienced a lot of rejection, a lot of fighting with others. But nothing could change
my mind, I knew my destination, I knew my way. I decided to leave the country, and
this lady from Longview Texas helped me move to the United States. We went to
127
Texas and continue to live there today.
Sometimes things are beyond our grasps. But I don’t try to explain it all because
I know and I believe that God knows better. I believe that I don’t need to explain
everything. But why it was shown to me and why was I chosen? It was a question
that I honestly didn’t care about. I care that I deeply believe in a God of love and God
is love. And I believe God created everything for betterness and for an incredible
future if we don’t ruin it.

THE TESTIMONY OF DR DONALD WHITAKER
Picture resource:
Rawlings, Maurice, To Hell and Back, Divine Revelations,
http://www.divinerevelations.info/documents/rawlings/dr_rawlings_near_
death_experiences2.htm
It was February of 1975, at that time I was an alcoholic out of control. I was
also using recreational drugs. But primarily, alcohol was my drug of choice. I was
totally out of control. I had a lot of friends in the entertainment business; Ringo
Star and a bunch of other people.
They were having a TV special on the west coast. Hoight (a friend) had called
me and asked me if I would like to go. I told him that I would love to, because I knew
there was going to be a lot of booze, and partying. While they were doing their
special, I was doing my thing.
After about three or four days out there, I became ill. I had severe pain in my
abdomen. I flew into Oklahoma city, called a senator friend of mine, and asked him
to send a car for me because I was sick. They sent a car and took me home. And I
checked into Whatley hospital in Texarkana, Texax in February of 1975. I checked
in with electrolytes, which means that the chemicals in my body were so far out of
balance that they had to give me IVs to build me up.
131
At that time of my life, I was atheist. I was hard core atheist and was living for
myself. Atheists are self centered, they live for themselves. This is where I found
myself in 1975 in my hospital.
After 3 days they operated me. Later, I found myself in the intensive care on a
respirator, which means it was breathing for me. I couldn’t speak. I’ve been there
in a comma. I heard these people talking about how sick I was and how I was going
to die and how I wouldn’t get out of the hospital. At that time my hair was very long
because I just wore my hair long. And I heard one guy say, “My, his hair is long.” And
another guy said, “Not nearly as long as it is going be before he gets out of here.”
And the third voice said, “He’s not going to get out of here. He’s going to die.”
And after 3 days, I could breath on my own. I remember my doctor, my surgeon,
Dr. Donald Dunkon said to me, “Don, if you have anything to get right, if you have
anything to get signed, you get it done because we are not sure how long you have.”
I knew I had a condition which is that was called Acute hemorrhagic narcotic
pancreatitis. You don’t live with this disease. You could live with pancreatitis. You
could even live with Acute pancreatitis, but you do not live with Acute hemorrhagic
narcotic pancreatitis. Dunkon had told my two sons that I would be dead before
morning. They didn’t expect me to survive.
I was laying there, a professed atheist. I didn’t believe in God. I believed in the
power of the universe because I’ve seen it. As a physician, I’ve dealt with life and
death. I believed in something, but don’t talk me about God. And surely don’t talk
to me about resurrection, virgin birth or this type of things because I am in research
and science. The Majority of PHDs in research and science don’t believe in God.
They do not believe a supreme being. They are beginning to believe there is an
order in the universe because the further along we go, we see the order.
It is very easy to be an atheist when you are successful. You have worked your
way from Oklahoma welfare to be one of the most powerful men in your part of the
country – one of the most powerful men in the state of Oklahoma, politically. It is
very easy to be an atheist when you have done all of that. A man could sit back and
say “I don’t need God. What is God?”
But it is very difficult to be an atheist when you are lying on the death bed,
because you began thinking “what if these people are right?” There had been one
man named Ron Short, that stood between me and the gates of hell. One man had
witnessed to me about the love of Jesus for 5 years, before I became ill. I would
debate him and I liked him, because he did what he said he was going to do. He was
the only one that I saw that profess to be Christian and lived what he said he was
going to do. I really respected him. I didn’t believe what he said but I respected
132
him.
When I was lying on my death bed and knowing that I was going to die, guess
who I thought about? I thought, “what if Ron is right? What if there is a Heaven and
a Hell.” Almost immediately the most pressing thought in my mind is how do I get
saved. What is saved? How do I get saved?
So I sent people out to get Ron Short. I wanted him to come down because I
wanted him to do whatever he had to do. I had no idea how a man hanging on a
tree in Israel 2000 years ago could save me. What is that to me? But I knew he had
something that I had to have. That night Ron wasn’t home, he was in Alabama. So
I had people go and get Ron.
That night was the longest night that I’ve had in my entire life, before or since.
As I am laying there in bed, I had begun to fade away into darkness. It was so, so
dark. It was like the darkness just penetrated into your very being. I can tell you
that I left my body because I remember coming back into my body. I don’t know
where I was out of my body.
There are people that talk about a light, or floating above, a feeling of warmth
or love. I didn’t feel any of that. I felt none of that. I felt untold terror, untold terror.
I knew that if I went all the way, if I slipped all the way, I would never get back. In
my being of beings I knew that. So I fought all night long.
They told me later on that I not only pull the mattress cover off the mattress, I
put the mattress upon me. I had to stay, I had to wait till Ron got there. Whatever
he had to do, I had to wait.
But again when I would leave my body, I would be going down into deep dark
terror. My skin began to get cold. Not the kind of cold you feel when you walk out in
the air, no, this was bone chilling cold. And I could feel the coldness began to come
up my legs.
Again I would begin to leave my body and would be in the darkness, in that void.
I remember one time entering back my body, I felt my body thud, my physical body
thud. Believe me, believe me, that was the most horrifying terrifying experience
that I had ever encountered.
I fought all night long. The next morning around 9:30 or 10 o’clock, Ron came
in. He said, “Dr. Whitaker, what do they say are your chances?” I said, “Ron, they
tell me I have none.” He said, “Now is the time.” I said, “You’re right.”
Before, I had cursed him, I had spit on him, but now it was the time because I
had to have whatever he had. I had a short period of time left on earth and I didn’t
have any idea when I might make that trip and go all the way.
133
sinner’s prayerAt that time Ron simply led me in a sinner’s pray. I had no idea
what a sinner’s prayer was, but I trusted Ron. He led me through the sinner’s prayer
and told me that Jesus had died for my sins. He had died for the sins of the world.
I didn’t quite understand that. He showed me in the word of God where that was
written.
You have to understand that I am a man of books. I’ve spent big part of my
life, 25 or 26 years of life in books, all types of scientific books. I have degrees in
Chemistry, all the way up to medicine doctor to practical medicine.
He told me and I believed him because it said so in this book. It was a new book
to me, it was called Bible. I had Ron lead me, and I said the sinner’s prayer. I can tell
you one thing, there was a peace that came over me like I have never known.
bottles of beerI’ve searched for that peace in the bottles, alcohol, needles, drugs,
and women. I’ve searched for it in all type of places. But there was no peace in my
life. But once I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and savior, I was no longer afraid.
I still believed I was going to die because I knew the condition I had, and you don’t
survive it. I knew that, I am a physician. I knew what I had you did not survive.
Ron showed me in the word of God where it says, “These signs shall follow those
that believe. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.” (Mark 16:18)
I walk around on planet earth this day, taking no insulin, taking no enzymes, eating

me to function without having to take medication.

THE TESTIMONY OF RITA CHUTER
I had major surgery on my legs in 1969 when I was 32 years of age. Whilst on
the operating table, and under anaesthetic, I had a cardiac arrest.
The only way I can describe it is that, although my body was on the table, and the
doctors were fighting to get me back to life again, part of me was above them, and
began to float away from that operating theatre. I started to go down and down. It
was horrific. I could see faces in pits, contorted with agony and pain. As I continued
to go down, I began to be tormented by demons of all shapes and sizes. Not only
were they ugly, but the smell was dreadful.
What made this downward journey even more terrifying were the lost souls I
could see. There were many other awful things of which I cannot bear to speak. I
came into a room where I could smell sulphur, and I saw a lake of fire. I could feel
the flames and heat from that fire. My thoughts were that if I hit the bottom I would
stay forever. There is never ending night and day for eternity in that dreadful place
where the fear, pain and torment never cease.
It was bad enough hearing the screams and seeing indescribable horrors. But
then I saw my own father in that place. I wanted so much to help, but knew I could
not do anything for him. My father had been a good man, and became very sick with
cancer. The vicar came to see him and asked if he could pray, but my father refused
any prayer, or any mention of Jesus. He wanted nothing to do with Him. Now, as I
looked at him, I knew he regretted that decision to turn his back on Jesus. It was his
free will choice, but what devastating consequences! As I continued to look with
horror at the situation he was in, it was if his thoughts spoke to me again. He told
me to warn my mother, so that she would not have to come to this terrible place
where there was no respite, and no end to the torment.
The heat was unbearable. I also knew there was nothing I could do to release
my father from his ‘chosen’ destination. I was also terrified lest I should dragged
down and forced to stay there. In my desperation I cried out to God, ‘Oh, God, please
help me!’
136
At the moment of crying out to God, I heard another voice crying, ‘We have a
heartbeat!’ I wanted to tell the surgeon, and the rest of the team, that I had been to
Hell, and was terrified. I was put on oxygen. They kept telling me to rest because
they were concerned about me, and wanted me to get well. Nevertheless, I kept
trying to tell them, ‘I’ve been to Hell, and I never want to go there again!’
Yet still I did not come into a close relationship with Jesus. I allowed Satan to
deceive me, and to draw me away from a true walk with God. There were further
major operations. Each time I went into hospital I was in absolute terror of death
and Hell. I kept seeing myself burning in the flames, being tormented like my poor
father. My mother and sister would not listen to what I had to say about dad and
Hell. The problem was I did not go to the right people for help, and I became more
and more taken over by the torment and fear with which Satan and his evil spirits
confused me.
It was when I was 50 years old that my lovely daughter Michelle came to see
me one day. She told me that she had given her life to Jesus, and that she knew of
someone who would be able to help me. Thank God I agreed to allow Canon Jim Fry
to come and pray for me. On 23 February 1987 my life was completely changed. As
Canon Fry prayed for me, God spoke to me saying, ‘I have sent my beloved Son, Jesus,
to deliver and set you free.’ I saw the battle going on for my soul in the spiritual realm,
but Jesus dealt with it all. I was set free to go and tell other people what He had done for
me, in order to set other captives free.
What a wonderful day that was. My husband was there too, and he also gave his
life to Jesus. We were both set free, born again by the Spirit of God, never again to
be tormented by fear.
In 1995, Rita Chuter died at her appointed time, and we know that she is now with
Jesus.

“In the year of 1904, I held a meeting of several day’s duration in the city of
Wang Kia Kwan Dswang. My audience consisted of the most stupid and ignorant
of Chinese women. Some of them were converts, but most of them came to hear
the Gospel for the first time. Among these last was a Mrs. Jang, who seemed,
if possible, a little more stupid than the rest. She was one of our number, not
because of any interest she felt in Bible truth, but because her husband, formerly a
Confucian scholar, had accepted the Savior and wished her to know something of
the fundamental principles of Christianity. Her two little children, who were always
with her, consumed much of her time and strength. There were some twenty others
in the class to be taught, and I had little chance to give individual attention. The
prospect of her learning enough truth to be converted was not encouraging.
“My one method of work, however, was prayer with complete reliance upon the
power of God through the Holy Spirit to fulfill His promise in John 14 :13,14: ‘And
139
whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do that the Father may be glorified
in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it’. In the course of these
meetings the Father was glorified in the conversion of Mrs. Jang; for after four days
of simple instruction she returned to her home a new creature in Christ Jesus.
“About six months later, when I was holding services in a neighboring village,
Mrs. Jang appeared again. This time she brought three children and the family dog.
(She had given away the chickens.) Again she stayed four days, absorbed as much
truth as she could under the trying circumstances, and again returned home.
“Soon after, she contracted tuberculosis and suffered intensely for a year. Her
physical pain was only a part of her distress. Her family realized that a great change
had taken place in her life, but they would not accept her testimony. They were
especially bitter because she unbound her feet. Disregarding such a time-honored
custom was a serious disgrace to them. They tortured her in all sorts of little
meanness’s. She would be refused a drink when she was too ill to get it for herself,
and she was frequently told that she was to be buried with her feet bare. A modest
Chinese woman has only her face and hands uncovered, even in death.
Visions of Other Parts of the Heavenly City
“In the midst of all her pain and trials Mrs. Jang maintained a bright clear
testimony. She grieved only because her dear ones would not receive the message
of life that so thrilled and comforted her own soul.
“The dreadful disease had about done its work, when I again found myself in
her vicinity. The pastor of the church in which I was speaking came to tell me of her
year of suffering.
“ ‘Miss Vaughan’, he said, ‘the only prayer she has offered for herself during all
these months is that she may see your face again.’
The Body in Death Chamber
“Needless to say I went to her immediately. I was received with a welcome of
such apparently boundless affection that I felt I had never before known what love
was. A few days passed. It was evident that it was God’s will to take Mrs. Jang home,
and we who loved her ceased to pray for her recovery. We asked only that God
would give her great peace in going, and lift from her heart the burden of grief that
it carried because her testimony had not been received by those nearest her.
“I made what I supposed was my last visit to her. ‘We will never see our friend
140
on earth again’, I said to my class. ‘She is very near the heavenly home, and can not
possibly live through the night.’
“Early the next morning her father called upon me. ‘Your daughter is now at
rest and in the Savior’s presence,’ I said.
“He smiled. ‘Oh, no, no!’ he said excitedly. ‘The Lord has performed a wonderful
miracle. She is alive again.
“Then he explained. Mrs. Jang had died at three o’clock the afternoon before,
and her family, in accordance with Chinese custom, had immediately prepared her
body for burial. At about sunset they heard a noise in the death chamber. They
supposed that the children or pigs or chickens (they have equal freedom in the
houses of the poor) had gotten into the room. But when they opened the door they
could scarcely believe their eyes. Mrs. Jang sat erect on the kang. She had removed
her grave clothes and put on those she had been wearing before her death!
“I never taught Revelation in China and nothing had ever been told Mrs. Jang of
the glories of Heaven as described in that book. She had instruction for only eight
days in her life.
Visions of Other Parts of the Heavenly City
Mrs. Jang Inside the Golden City
“This is her story as she related it to me: ‘I remember seeing all the family
around me crying. Then the Lord Jesus came into my room and took me by the hand
and said, ‘Come with me!’ In a short time we were before a gate of pearl. It was the
gate of Heaven. Angels opened it and we went in. I saw many beautiful houses all of
pretty colors. I walked beside the Lord on the golden streets. Miss Vaughan, I was
so glad you had told me to unbind my feet; I would have been so ashamed to walk
beside my Savior with little feet.
“Then we went on and I saw thousands of angels in a circle, singing and playing
lovely music. In the midst was the throne of glory. The Heavenly Father sat upon it,
and when I saw Him I was afraid. I hardly dared to lift my eyes’.
“ ‘You have come’, He said.
“ ‘Yes, Lord.’
“ ‘You may go back for a while, but you must return to me here on the twelfth
of the month’.
141
Sent Back to Earth
“ ‘Miss Vaughan, here I am, and now they’ll have to accept my testimony, for I
have walked on the golden streets and I’ve seen the Father. They’ll have to believe
me now.’
“Did her relatives and neighbors believe her?
“People flocked in from miles around to hear the wonderful story. She spoke
as an eyewitness and they could not reject her testimony. God’s mighty power was
upon it, and hundreds were converted. Even today, missionaries in that vicinity
find an eager reception for the Gospel message because that is the ‘Jesus doctrine’
believed by Mrs. Jang who went to heaven and came back again to tell what she saw.
“The days passed until the twelfth of the following month. When that day came
the family tried to convince Mrs. Jang that she had reckoned the date incorrectly,
but her eager heart was not to be deceived. Late in the afternoon she asked her
mother for her grave clothes. Under strong protest they were folded and put on the
bed. At sunset while the family were at their evening meal in an adjoining room, she
dressed herself quietly in her burial garments then lay down, and her beautiful soul
went back to her God”.
Just an ignorant Chinese woman whose whole education had been gained in
a few days ! yet how wonderfully God used her to His glory in the saving of souls .

US.
143
THE TESTIMONY OF GEORGE LENNOX
During the winter of 1887 and 1888, Lennox worked in the coal mines, a place
that seemed dangerous to him. He reported the fact to the officer in charge, who
made an examination, and deciding that the room was safe, ordered Lennox back
to his work. The convict, obeying, had not continued his work more than an hour,
when the roof fell in and completely buried him. He remained in this condition fully
two hours.
Missed at dinnertime, a search was instituted for the missing convict, and he
was found under this heap of rubbish. Life seemed extinct. He was taken to the top,
and on examination by the prison physician, was pronounced dead. His remains
were carried to the hospital where he was washed and dressed, preparatory for
interment. His coffin was made and brought to the hospital. The chaplain had
arrived to perform the last sad rites preparatory to burial. A couple of prisoners
were ordered by the hospital steward to lift the corpse from the boards and carry
it across the room and place it in the coffin. They obeyed, one at the head, and
other at the feet and were about half way across the room when the one who was
at the head accidentally stumbled over a cuspidor, lost his balance, and dropped
the corpse. The head of the dead man struck the floor, and to the utter surprise and
astonishment of all present, a deep groan was heard. Soon the eyes opened, and
other appearances of life were manifested. The physician was immediately sent for,
and by the time he arrived, some thirty minutes, the dead man had called for a cup
of water, and was in the act of drinking when the physician arrived.
The coffin was at once removed and later on was used to bury another convict.
His burial robes were also taken from him, and the prison garb substituted. On an
examination he was found to have one of his legs broken in two places, and was
otherwise bruised. He remained in the hospital some six months, and again went
to work.
I learned of his peculiar experience while apparently dead soon after, from a
fellow miner. Prompted by curiosity, I longed for an acquaintance with Lennox to
get his experience from his own lips. This opportunity was not offered for several
months. At last it came. After being removed from the mines I was detailed to one
144
of the prison offices to make out some annual reports. The subject of this man’s
return to life was being discussed one day, when he happened to pass by the office
door and was pointed out to me. It was not long until I had a note in his hand, and
asked him to come where I was at work. He did so, and here I got well acquainted
with him, and from his own lips received his wonderful story. He is a young man,
probably not over thirty years of age. He had been a hardened criminal; is possessed
of a very good education, and naturally very bright.
The most wonderful part of his story was that during the time he was dead.
Being a shorthand reporter, I took his story from dictation.
I had a presentiment all the morning that something terrible was going to
happen. I was so uneasy on account of my feelings that I went to my mining boss Mr.
Grason, and told him how I felt, and asked him if he would not come and examine
my coal room, the place where I was digging coal. He came and seemed to make a
thorough examination, and ordered me back to work, saying there was no danger,
and that he thought I was going, ‘cranky’. I returned to my work, and had been
digging away for something like an hour, when all of a sudden, it grew very dark.
Then it seemed as if a great iron door swung open and I passed through it. The
thought then came to my mind that I was dead and in another world. I could see
no one, nor hear sound of any kind. From some cause unknown to myself, I started
to move away from the doorway, and had traveled some distance when I came to
the banks of a broad river. It was not dark, neither was it light. There was about as
much light as on a bright, starlit night. I had not remained on the banks of this river
very long until I could hear the sound of oars in the water, and soon a person in a
boat rowed up to where I was standing.
I was speechless. He looked at me for a moment, and then said that he had
come for me, and told me to get into the boat and row across to the other side. I
obeyed. Not a word was spoken. I longed to ask him who he was, and where I was.
My tongue seemed to cling to the roof of my mouth. I could not say a word. Finally,
we reached the opposite shore. I got out of the boat, and the boatman vanished out
of sight.
Thus left alone, I knew not what to do. Looking out before me, I saw two roads
which led through a dark valley. One of these was a broad road and seemed to
be well traveled. The other was a narrow path and led off in another direction. I
instinctively followed the well-beaten road. I had not gone far when it seemed to
grow darker. Ever and anon, however a light would flash up from the distance, and
in this manner I was lighted on my journey.
Presently I was met by a being that is utterly impossible for me to describe. I
145
can only give you a faint idea of his dreadful appearance
. He resembled a man somewhat, but was much larger than any human being I
ever saw. He must have been at least ten feet high. He had great wings on his back.
He was black as the coal I had been digging, and in a perfectly nude condition. He
had a spear in his hand, the handle of which must have been fully fifteen feet in
length. His eyes shone like balls of fire. His teeth, white as pearl, seemed fully an
inch long. His nose, if you could call it a nose, was very large, broad and flat. His
hair was very coarse, heavy and long. It hung down upon his massive shoulders.
His voice sounded more like the growls of a lion in a menagerie than anything I can
recall.
It was during one of the flashes of light that I first saw him. I trembled like an
aspen leaf at the sight. He had his spear raised as if to send it flying through me. I
suddenly stopped. With that terrible voice I seem to hear yet, he bade me follow
him; that he had been sent to guide me on my journey. I followed. What else could
I do? After he had gone some distance a large mountain appeared to rise up before
us. The part facing us seemed perpendicular, just as if a mountain had been cut in
two and one part had been taken away. On this perpendicular wall, I could distinctly
see these words, ‘This is hell.’ My guide approached this perpendicular wall, and
with his spear handle gave three loud rasps. A large massive door swung back and
we passed in. I was then conducted on through what appeared to be a passage
through this mountain.
For some time we traveled in Egyptian darkness. I could hear the heavy footfalls
of my guide and thus could follow him. All the way along I could hear deep groans
as of some one dying. Further on, these groans increased, and I could distinctly hear
the cry water, water, water. Coming now to another gateway, and, passing through,
I could hear, it seemed, a million voices in the distance, and the cry was for water,
water. Presently another large door opened at the knock of my guide, and I found
that we had passed through the mountain, and now a broad plain lay before me.
At this place my guide left me to direct other lost spirits to the same destination.
I remained in this open plain for a time, when a being somewhat similar to the first
one came to me; but instead of a spear he had a huge sword. He came to tell me
of my future doom. He spoke with a voice that struck horror to my soul. ‘Thou art
in hell,’ he said; ‘for thee all hope is fled. As thou passed through the mountain on
thy way hither, thou didst hear the groans and shrieks of the lost as they called for
water to cool their parched tongues. Along that passage there is a door that opens
into the lake of fire. This is soon to be thy doom. Before thou art conducted to this
place of torment never more to emerge - for there is no hope for those who enter
146
there - thou shalt be permitted to remain in this open plain, where it is granted to all
the lost to behold what they might have enjoyed instead of what they must suffer.’
With this I was left alone. Whether the result of the terrible fright through
which I had passed I know not, but now I became stupified. A dull langour took full
possessionofmyframe.Mystrengthdepartedfromme.Mylimbsrefusedtosupport
my body longer. Overcome, I now sank down a helpless mess. Drowsiness now took
control of me. Half awake, half asleep, I seemed to dream. Far above me, and in the
distance, I saw the Beautiful City of which we read in the Bible. How wonderfully
beautiful were its walls of jasper. Stretching out and away in the distance, I saw vast
plains covered with beautiful flowers. I, too, beheld the river of life and the sea of
glass. Vast multitudes of angels would pass in and out through the gates of the city,
singing, oh, such beautiful songs. Among the number I saw my dear old mother,
who died a few years ago of a broken heart because of my wickedness. She looked
toward me and seemed to beckon me to her, but I could not move. There appeared
to be a great weight upon me that held me down. Now a gentle breeze wafted the
fragrance of those lovely flowers toward me, and I could now more plainly than
ever, hear the sweet melody of angel voices, and I said, ‘Oh, that I could be one of
them.’
As I was drinking from this cup of bliss it was suddenly dashed from my lips.
I was aroused from my slumbers. I was brought back from happy dreamland by
an inmate of my dark abode, who said that it was now time to enter upon my
future career. He bade me follow him. Retracing my steps I again entered the dark
passageway, and followed my guide for a time, when we came to a door that opened
in the side of the passage, and going along this, we finally found ourselves passing
through another door, and lo! I beheld the lake of fire.
Just before me I could see, as far as the eye could reach, that literal lake of fire
and brimstone. Huge billows of fire would roll over each other, and great waves of
fiery flame would dash against each other and leap high in the air like the waves of
the sea during a violent storm. On the crest of the waves I could see human beings
rise, but soon to be carried down again to the lowest depths of this awful lake of fire.
When borne on the crest of these awful billows for a time their curses against a just
God would be appalling, and their pitiful cries for water would be heart-rending.
This vast region of fire echoed and re-echoed with the wails of these lost spirits.
Presently I turned my eyes to the door through which I had a few moments
before entered, and I read these awful words, ‘This is thy doom; Eternity never
ends.’ Shortly I began to feel the earth give way under my feet, and I soon found
myself sinking down into the lake of fire. An indescribable thirst for water now
147
seized upon me. And calling for water my eyes opened in the hospital prison.
I have never told this experience of mine before for fear the prison officials
would get hold of it, think me insane and lock me in the crankhouse. I passed
through all of this, and I am as well satisfied as I am that I live, that there is a heaven
and there is a hell, and a regular old-fashioned hell, the kind the Bible tells about.
But there is one thing certain, I am never going to that place any more.
As soon as I opened my eyes in the hospital and found that I was alive and on
earth once more. I immediately gave my heart to God and I am going to live and
die a Christian. While the terrible sights of hell can never be banished from my
memory, neither can the beautiful things of heaven I saw, I am going to meet my
dear old mother after awhile. To be permitted to sit down on the banks of that
beautiful river, to wander with those angels across the plains, through the vales
and over the hills carpeted with fragrant flowers, the beauty of which far surpasses
anything that mortal can imagine; to listen to the songs of the saved - all this will
more than compensate me for living the life of a Christian here on earth, even if I
have to forego many sensual pleasures in which I indulged before coming to the
prison. I have abandoned my companions in crime, and am going to associate with
good people when I am once more a free man.
