  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  I had never heard of NDEs or OBEs when this happened to me. It was ten days after surgery and I was scheduled to go home the next morning, but when the nurse checked my pulse early in the morning, she found no pulse. I had bled to death during the night. I remember this causing much confusion in the hospital ward, and my body was rushed to the trauma room. I remember floating near the ceiling and being VERY SAD because I had a six month old daughter that would not have the care of a mommy. The staff administered blood transfusions and I slowly came back into my body sometime later. The time this took is now uncertain in my mind.
