We had an above ground pool.  Pools are most of the time only partially drained for winter, such as this one was. The six year old boy talked me into climbing up the ladder to look at the ice (about two feet from the top of the pool). I don't know if he pushed me or if I slipped, but the next thing I remember is looking up and seeing I was under the ice.

My next memory is of looking down towards the front of my house. I can remember seeing the snow on the roof, and had a perspective to see the front and side of the house, as if I was looking at the front corner, from about fifteen feet in the air and about fifteen feet from the house. I can remember everything looked bluish, as if I had blue sunglasses on.


I also saw the boy that was with me, come running down my driveway, pound on the side door of the house and keep on running. I remember being frustrated as I tried to yell at him to get my mom, but he couldn't hear.


My next memory is of waking up in my bed with blankets wrapped all around me and my mom was taking care of me. Apparently, she had heard the boy pound on the door and went to look, found me in the pool, and pulled me out.


I can recall all of this and many other very early childhood memories very well. The funny thing with this whole ordeal is, it wasn't until I was twenty nine years old that I realized I had actually had an out of body experience. The whole thing seemed so natural that I didn't even think twice about it.
