PARTRIDGE, 179a.
To thefriendly and judicious Reader
I AM mod happy in having again an opportunity to pre-
fent to you my annual work ; an Almanack, in the
tompofition of which I have found, for many years fo
much pleafure ; and I truft that Merlin us has afforded us
readers a like fatisfaclionj and that they have found it to
contain wherewithal fome pi ohtabie inftruction.
I alluded in my laft to many of thofe then hidden events,
which have been produced in the courfe of the wonderful
year that is pafted. An annus mirahilis, in which kingdoms
have undergone revolutioos, ai d fiates beeu new order-
ed. Qn the wifdorn xnd temper of L collators, it depends
finally to fettle and arrange the new fyfiems, and to make
them lafling and profpeious. They 'will, however, have
xmny enemies, and even wars (if the prudence of ^ood men
does not prevail) may be excited againft them. But we will
liope for the belt, and for victory to the lovers of peace.
Jn looking forward to the coming year, and comparing
the mundane afpecls, there is fufficient caufe to believe, that
our Commerce will be mod profperous in 1792 ; and that
our (hips will cume freighted into harbour with the riches
of the Eah% the Well, the North, and the South. Some
foreign iilands, however, feem liable to mucK commotion,
and blood will be fpiit— we do not, however, conjecture inch
iflands belong to wealthy Britain but are the dependencies
•f other kingdoms
From
( 3 )
But from what weori forefee, we have reafon to fear that re-
ligious dilTenfions will continue to prevail. Mankind have
ever fuftered much from them ;
yet the warm and violedt
on each fide, will not open their eyes, and be perfuaded'
they are in error. Seldom do they rellecl in their various
difputes, that there can be no religion without chriltian
charity, temperance, and love, Dj you, howaver, my
hiends, cultivate thefe virtues, and ever endeavour to cure
the wounds of difleniion, and ferve mankind.
We have reafon to 'apprehend, that there will be found
pcrfons in this country fu wrong-headed in their notions of
Government, as not to be the beil friends of our good King.
We hope, however, fuch men are few in number ; and that
whoever delires to dettroy our excellent Conftituuon of
ting, Lords, and Commons,'* Will be difcovered and
jmiiilbed. We have always been loyal to the Houfe of
Hanover, now on the Throne—and may they long be there.
Fear Gjdf and honour the King^ fhould be every Briton s
motto.
We hope, however, we fhall hear no more of thofe (hock-
ing ri6tous proceedings which drove feveral from their peace-
ful habitations only to return to find them in ruins. Re-
member, that the riotous and feditious are equally the ene-
mies of our good King and his Government. Be peaceable
then, my friends, and be content in your ftate. Al ways bring
your mind to bear your fituation, and to iuit your.ciicum-
ftances. Let alio all you do, whether fuccefsfu! or not, be
well meant ; and having honefly and a good confeience, a&d
not wanting a juft reverence for God, and regard for your
King and Country, you mud be happy ; and that you may
be fu, is the fincere wilh of
Your faithful,
MERLIN US LIBER ATUS.

Reader, by this final! Table thou may'ft count
How little fums in time to great amount
A Penny daily very fmail appears,
But's more than tvoenty Pourwls in fourteen Years :
A Groat a day is but a fmail expence,
Yet makes i'tl^ Tear fix Pounds and twenty Pence.
Then neither Time nor Onn profufely waite,
Left thou repent it ere this year be palt.

Let there be light, that inftant darknefs fled ;

10 February hath xxix days.
And Handing high amtdlt a iiood of day,
Arwund his. orb the Planets took their way',
The Sun maintaining thus a centra! fear,
Spreads through all nature a prolific heat ;
'Tis him each nation owns a needdil friend,
And on his influence all mankind drpend.

Obfervaripns.
The afpe£U c
this month are fev,
and benevoleni,
and at the prelem
things look kindly!
at home, though
there is ftirring a
broad. God pre
ferve the King and
Parliament, and
prolper all their
endeavours, and
undertakings. Let
the Church of
England flouriih
in virtue,kindnefs,
candour, and to-
lerance, with all
the righteous that
are in and out of
authority ; for
when the wicked
bear rule (though
they are never fuch
pretended faints)
then the people
mourn, andjuftly
complain. Ob-
ferve, a righteous
and good mati will
regard even the
life and comfort of
his beaft : but the
ttndereli mercies
of a wicked man,
at the belt, are but
cruel.
14 April hath xxx days.
Her waning beam is evt ry month revitWed,
And her full orb as ofren is renew'd ;
Her varying face the gardener (till attends,
And fvbnts and g»thers, as her change befriends;
Her influence reaches human bodies too,
Mingles their fluids with its baneful dew.

The afpecls of
this month are of
a heating nature.
On the 4th
of this month,
was born hr
molt excellent
Majefty King
Georgelll.whc
having ruled
for thirty- twe
Years thefe 1m
penal realms
to the glory of
God, and hap
pinefs of his
people, has
given us a llock
of ill ultrious
Princes, that
juftifies the
vvilhes of the
nation that the
line may neve'j
be extinct.
Succefsful are
the endeavours of
the wife and pru
dent notwithftand
ing'the malice of
the felf-interefied
pasty, who, rather
I hail lofe their
headsin modelling,
would fling it
in a tlame.
20 July, hath xxxi days.
I hy lurtre, beaureous ftar, To fills her place,
We fcarce complain we want her fuller race.
The 'polar Jiar eternally rt mains,
Fixt to the north, on theceleftial plains,
The wand'ring mariner's unerring guide
When tofs'd in tempefts on the fwelling tide.

Obfervations,
This month pro-
duces 5 fquares, 3
Textiles, and 2 con-
junctions, there is
like to be many
fecret contrivances
and much under-
hand dea'ing..
The fquare of
the fun and jupiter,
frooeardinalfigns,
fignifies conttfts
about religion.
I have read of
7 things that God
hates (id efi) a
proud look, a ly-
ing tongue, hands
that (hed innocent
bloody a heart that
devifeth wicked
imaginations,
fVet that be fwift
in running to mif-
chief, a falfe wit-
nefs, and him thst
foweth difcord
among brethren,
and all under the
cloak of religion,
therefore a wolf
though he Walkf
about in fhicep's
cloathing, is a
wolf ftiftr
22 Auguft hath xxxi days.
When raging winds acrcls the billows roar
And heave the beaten Ihip from fhore to fhore
He views his Compafj with obferving eye,
The Needle veering (o the polar fky,
Guided by this a certain courfe he forms
Thro' thickeft darknefs, and thro' fiercer! ftorms.

But who can count the wonders of t lie iky,
Orb above orb immcafurably high ?
Who can their courferertrain, their marches trace,
Thro* the valr compafs of the etherial fpace ?
Each in its fphere moves regularly on r
Not touching and Untouched their ftages run.

Obferyations,
May all remain
well in our metro-
politan city; but
there is an afpecl
this month which
may not prove fo
favourable to that
or fome other Im-
perial city.
Innumerable
however, are the
indances in which
we have been
biefTed with the
bounties of provi-
dence. May his
mercies ftill be ex-
tended towards us
and every impend-
ing evil be avert-
ed from us, fc
that with pious
gratitude to God,
loya'ty toourKing,
and benevolence to
our fellow fubjetfs,
we may happily
end this year, and
in health and com-
fort begin the next.
Such is my wilh,
and let all fay,
Amen.

JUDICIOUS READER,
IT has a!wa)i hefcn a pleafing tafk to me to rsll your par-
ticular and fenous attention to thofe glorious orbs that
move around us, to lead you to confider " the Sun when it
Jbinethy and the Moon walking in brigbtnefs" (Job xxxi.
v. 26) as being, I am perfuaded, one of the bed means of
carrying you up to the grand contemplation of their Great
Author, even the Father, of Lights (James 1. 17) before
whom all the Holt of Heaven is Handing in array. A
contemplation of this nature cannot fail of its due effeft,
and will render you what every genuine lover of Aftronomy
could wi(h, more dutiful and pious to your God, more loyal
to your King, and better inclined to do ads of kindnefs and
benevolence to your fellow creatures; and fuch effects I
truft you have been fenfible of, and happy in having
known.
Rightly, however, to^contemplate, it is neceffary that
you Ihould rightly underfland ; and to do this, 1 think a
brief defcription of our Solar Syftem, and the vifible hea-
venly bodies, will give you the bed, though an imperfect
notion, of the wonders of creation. Our Solar Syftem, then,
comKis of the Sun, and the Pbnets moving round him.
The Sun, at the dillance fixed Stars are, wDuld have the
appearance of a Star only, and all its Planets would be in-
vifible. The fixed Stars are called fixed becaufe they al-
ways keep the fame diflance one f#om another, and there is
no doubt (fuch is the immenfity of the univerfe) that they
are all other funs like ours, and that each of them have
other planets moving round them. The planets are fo
called from a Greek word which fignifies their wandering,
. becaufe they change their places, and keep moving round
the Sun, and do not, confequently, like the fixed Stars (which
Stars you may know by their twinkling) preferve the fame
diftance from each other. Of thefe planets, the Earth and
five others were only obferved formerly ; but the great Mr.
Herfchell has lately difecvered a fixth, more diftant from
the Sun than any of the reft, and which, in honour to his
great patron, our gracious King Geokge ill. lie has
named
Partridge, 1792. 39
named the Georgium Sidxs, or George's Star. The names,
<flfituations, f;gns, &c. of the others, are asfollf vvs

AH the above are called primary planets ; hut there are Mo
others which are called fecondary planets, thefe are Satellites
Or Moons attending the. primary planets. Saturn being at
fiich a great diftance from the Sun, and requiring more of
their auxiliary light, has«five of them, Jupiter has four, and
our Earth has ens Moon, which moves round us in tha>
courfeof 29 days 12 hours and 44 minutes, and appear to
us larger than any other planet, becaufe Ihe is nearefl^to
us, though (he is certainly the fmalleft, for to a fpedlator
from the Sun ihe would be fcarcely viilble.
And here I cannot help remarking another inftance of
the Almighty's peculiar favour to the whole of this work4
,
cur Earth; for whereas when the chearing rays of the Sun
are withdrawn from the various portions of the globe, he
gives in quick fucceffion unto all here, the benefit of the
Moon's reflected light, and by her friendly aid relieves the
wintry darknefs of the poles ;
yet by one half of the inha-
bitants of the Moon (as fhe only turns once round her axis
as ihe moves round us, always predentin tr the fame fide to
us) we are never feen, unlefs they take a journey upon their
giobe to that fide which is next to us, and for which pur-
pofe fome of them mult travel more than 1500 miles. —But
then to fuch of them as do fee us, we mull: appear indeed a
glorious orb—to them we muft feem to be the largelr. body
in the univerfe, for as the furface of the Earth is thirteen
times greater than that of the Moon, we mult reflect upon
them thirteen times as much light, and appear thirteen
times as large to them as fhe does to us.
G 4 Thia.

This very brief and faint defcription of Creation, will
naturally lead us to reflect upon oar own nothingnefs ; and
*
the goodnefs of that Great Being who regirdf fuch an in-
fignificant portion of his work as we are. It will lead us
to love and to adore Almighty Power ; it will confirm our
faith, as it clearly (hews that the univerfe bears evident
witnefs to the truth of the infpired hifto ian, Mofcs's ac-
count of it, by the revolutions of its orbs, and the fuccef-
lions of its feafons ; it (hews (as a great author obferves) that

Of the different Quarters of the Tear 1792.
WINTER QUARTER,
"Which takes its beginning at fuch Time as the glorious
Lamp of Heaven, the Sun, touches the firft point of Capri-
corn, or the celeftial Goat, which happens this year on
Dec. 2i, at 7 h. 46 m. p m. 1791, an ^ continues till the
iqth of March. At this ingrefs we find 15 deg. of Leo
afcends the Eaftern horizon, and about 28 deg. of T is up-
on the mid-heaven ; and Mars is in the firft, the 5 and ?
in the fourth,, and the Sun in the 6th, 1? in the 10th, and
Jupiter in the fourth; and thus are the planets pofited at
this ingrefs ; when 6 of the 7 planets are under the Earth,
and Saturn in the 10th, which fhews many clofe confuta-
tions, and underhand dealings will be carried on in this
quarter. Feuds and animonties, and crimes too, will be
fU'U in vogue, grumbling, grudging, and repining at each,
other's good. The common enemy to Europe, and indeed
to all mankind, ever awake for nefarious purpofes, incites
to vice and every fpecies of impiety ; unhappy are :hofe

, Now Winter Is come with his cold-chilling breath,
And the verdure is droppM from the trees;
All nature feems touch'd with the ringer of death,
And the irrtams are beginning to freeze.
Now the <.old fe.ither'd fnow does in fleeces defcend
And whiten the profpecls around ;
And the keen cutting winds from the North do attend,
Hard incruftating over the ground.
Now the poor harmlefs hare may be trae'd to the wood*.
By her footfleps indented in fnow;
And the lips and the fingers are ltarting with blood ;
And the markfmen a cock mooting go.
Now the day is come round when a Saviour was born,
All the world mould agree in one voice,

All the ends of the earth mould rejoice :
For grim Death is deprived of his all-killing fling,.

And the Rich Jbould remember the Poor.
SPRING QUARTER.
Which commenceth at fuch time as that Prince of I^igrit*
and glorious Taper, the Sun, mounts the equinoctial iign
Aries, or the princely celeftial Ram, which happerfs this
year on March 19, at 9 h. 22 m. And the planets are
erected in the following fcheme :

In which you find 18 deg. of Leo upon the mid-heaven,

and the planets are pofited in the foregoing fcheme in
which you fee the Sun and Moon ; in the 5th Saturn, in the
6th Jupiter, in the 12th Venus, Mercury in the 4th,
and Mars in the 12th. The Moon's application to § of
Mars, and body of Mercury, and the afpe&s between Saturn
and Mercury, and Jupiter and Mercury, in the month of
April, and the Sun, argue fome moil: violent wranglings
and debates in fome popular affembiies, much noife about
constitutions and itate affairs throughout Europe, even re-
viiings on religious fubjects are general, and much popular
commotion. I hope, however, all will be well, though as
the fourth cppofition of Saturn and Jupiter is at hand, high
people, very high people may dread fome grofs affront, it
is tobewifhed it may not be to Majeiry, but that wherever
the Reg?>l power refides, it may know nought butdelight
fpringing up like the budding feafon.
Again the blofTom'd hedge is feen,
The turf again is drefsM in green ;
Again the lark afcends the (ley,
No longer idle plough fhares lie.
Partridge, 1792. 43
The fwallovv that the fields forfook,
Revifits now, and fkims the brook.
The dew to ileeple-top up fprings,
The clam'rous rook extends his wings,
The fe2ther'd tribe on every fpray,
Chaunt lively carols to fhe day.
The leaves hang cluft'ring on the trees,
And health comes ridineon the breeze.
The garden moiff. with April fhow'rs,
Puts forth a family of flowers.
All this the bounteous hand of henven,
For man's delight has kindly given.
The SUMMER QUARTER.
The Summer Quarter is always faid to begin when this
our earthly Globe inclining fouthward 23 deg. 20 minutes
towards the Sun, will volve and remove us her Northern
inhabitants to the grealeft portion of dav, or when the Sua
(according to appearance) enters the firft fcruple of 2H f
which either way taken, is on June 20, at 17 h. iqm.
P. M. or vulgarly on Ju*ne the 21ft, at 19 m. pad five in
the morning. In which you may find about ig de?. of
Cancer afcends the Eaftern horizon, and 19 deg. of Pifces
is upon the mid-heaven. And thus are the planets pofued,
O and $ in the 12th, the Moon in the firft, <? and %. in
the fourth, ? and T? in the eleventh, and the Moon ap-
plies to the of Jupiter from cardinal iigns. Now the
former part of this quarter afford us many afpe&s—perhaps
of a healing nature, though much of the violence of bicker-
ing and debates is continued ; and difcoveries made in pri-
vate families that tend to Ihew that both the countenance
and the heart are extremely deceitful —this applies chiefly to
women; but fome very bafe acls are brought to light of the
other fex, that confirm the truth of the Latin (old Roman)
proverb, Multi homines nomine, non re (that is, Many are
men in namet but not in fadJ* The difeafes of this feafon

ground when hot, eat no great meals, and drink no fpiritcus
liquors—if ilrong, they will put you in a fever; if lowered
with water, they will only weaken you, and do you no
good. Verbum fapienti a <word to tht wuife :
Now Spring at length refigns her chearful fway,
Bright Sumn.er comes in all its fplendid day.
The mom n.ore early now with rofeate hue,
Difpels the night, and brings the Sun to view.
Now losded trees their different fruits produce,
For man's fweet pleafure, and for man's good ufe.
The fields now fcented with the mow'd down grafs^
Make beds for killing of the thrown down lafs
And horfe and man now fweating through the day,
Carry to rick the new-made fragrant hay ;
Nor ends their toil till the retiring Sun,
Declares the bufinefs of the day is done:
,
Then to their home the happy labourers hafte,
Where the good wife prepares the frugal feaft,
And gives the chearing cup, and decks the board.
With all the beft productions of her hoard;
While the pipe and the dance enlivens the plains,
And the cool eve rewards all their noontide pains.
The AUTUMNAL QUARTER.
Which takes its beginning at fuch time as the Sun enters
Libra, or the Earth, Aries, which happens this year on
September the 21ft, at 21.4. P. M. or vulgarly on the 22(1,
near nine in the morning. At this ingrefs we find about
2 deg. of Scorpio afcends, and 13 deg. of Leo is upon the
mid-heaven. The principal afpedts about this ingrefs is
the 5th and laftoppofition of Saturn and Jupiter, from the
beginning of Taurus and Scorpio; which fhews great dif«
agreemenrs have arifen either in a public or a private way,
which the fvvord alone can fettle. Oh ! when (hall we fee
the day when man fhall ceafe to fight againft man, and all
our weapons of war be turned into plough-fhares and
pruning- hooks ! Happy times, may their approach be near*
Partridge, 1792. 45
er than we think for ! A very ferious interruption in fome
commercial concerns may, if not providently prevented,
now occur ; but we mall look and hope for the beil of good
fortune. The difeafes of this feafon are fuch as afFed the
bowels, catarrhs, rheumatic and gouty pains, and fuch like,
fo that the old will take wifely to their flannels, and their
fne fides. If the young would be wife too, they would be
cautious alfo—Ye green-heads, mind what 1 fay, 11
keep
your heads cool and your feet warm." You will rind this a
good prescription.
Health, beauty, vigour, now decline
The pride of Summer's fplendid day;
Leaves all their ftems will now refign,
The mournful preludes of decay.
But let fair Virtue's fruit remain,
Though Summer with its leaves be fled
Then not forgotten, we'll not complain,
Butcherifti Autumn in its Head.
Vf the Edipjes in 1792.
This year is not a year producing any Eclipfe of either
luminary vifible from this Earth, and therefore I fhall give
the Type of none. Two invifible Eclipfes of the Sun,
however, will happen.
The firft invifible Eclipfe of the Sun will be on the 22d
of March, and happen near fix o'clock at night.
The fecond invifible Eclipfe of the Sun will be on the
16th of September, and happen near fix o'clock in the
morning.

And now my friends, as I underhand my parable of laft
year had its ufe, and was acceptable to you (for I inferted
ir quod pnidinU <vitam corfito monetj I (hall conclude with
the following, written by a celebrated Brother Almanack-
maker, now deceafed, in hopes that it will call your minds
from trifles and frivolous difputes to more fubHantial things.
When
Partridge, 1792. 47
When I was a child at feven years old, my friends on a
holiday, filled my little pocket with coppers. I went di-
rectly to a {hop where they fold toys for children ; and be-
ing charmed with the found of a whittle that I mef by the
way, in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and
gave all my money for one. I then came home and went
whittling all over the houfe, much pleafed with my whittle,
but difturbing all the family. My brothers, and fitters, and
coufins, underttanding the bargain I had made, told me I
had given four times as much for it as it wss worth. This
put- me in mind what good things I might have bought
with the reft of the money, and they laughed at me fo much
for my folly, that I cried with vexation —and the reflection
gave me more chagrin than the whittle gave me pleafure.
This, however, was afterwards of ufe to me, the impref-
fion continuing on my mind, fo that often when 1 w?s
tempted to buy fome unnecelfary thing, I faid to myfejf,
don't give too much for the whittle—and fo I faved my
money.
As I grew up, came into the world, and obferved the
actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many,
who gave too much for the whittle.
When I faw one too ambitious of court favours, facri-
fking his time in attendance at levees, his repofe, his liber-
ty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain it, I hayc
flid to myfelf, this man gives too much for his whittle.
When I faw another fond of popularity, conttantly
employing himfelf in political buttles, neglecting his own
affairs, and ruining them by that neglect, he pays indeed,
faid I, too much for the whittle.
If I knew a mifer, who gave up every kind of comfortable
living, ail the pleafure of doing good to others, all the
etteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of benevolent
fnendlhip, for the fake of accumulating wealth ; poor man,
faid I, you indeed pay too much for your whittle.
When I met with a man of pleafure, facrifking every
laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to
mere corporeal fenfations, and ruining his health in the
purfuit : Mittaken man, faid 1, you are providing pain for
•
5 yourfelf
48 Partridge, 1792.
yourfclf inflead of pleafure 5 you give too much for your
whittle.
If I faw one fond of fine clothes, fine houfes, fine furni-
ture, fine equipage, all above his fortune, for which he con-
tracts debt , and ends his career in prifon. Aias ! faid I,
he has paid dear, very dear, for his whittle.
When I faw a beautiful Aveet- tempered girl, married to .
an ill-natured brute of a hufband, what pity it is, faid I,
that fhe paid fo much for a w hittle.
In fhort, I conceived that J»reat part of the miferies of
mankind were brought upon them by the falfe eftimates
they hsd made of the value of things, and by their giving
400 much for their whittles.
To the PUBLIC. As it is more than probable that other Almanacks
will be printed and publifhed this year, entituled, Partridge's Almanack,
all perfons are hereby cautioned againft the fame, as they may depend
\ipon it, they are falfe and counterfeit. For I, Thomas Wright, of Eaten,
near Melton -Mowbray, Leicejterjbire, Grazier, Aftronomer, Mathematician,
and profettbr of Aftrology, have been for near the fourth of a century
the only Author of the true Partridge's Almanack, which I have always
-compiled from the original copy and inftrucliuns, as they were tranfmitted
and communicated to me by Mr. Tycho Wing, the fuccefl'or of Mr. Par-
tridge, for Mr. Partridge died in June 171$. And the right of printing
and publiming the faid Partridge's Almanack, which I formerly veiled in
the Company of Stationers at London, I have now transferred to Mr.
THOMAS PEARSON, Printer, Bookfeller, and Stationer*
in Birmingham, The Purchafers of Book Almanacks are therefore thus
publicly informed, that the faid Partridge's Almanack, published as afore-
laid, is the only true one, and are cautioned againit all others, as they
mult of confequence be counterfeit andfpurious.
