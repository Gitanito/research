I thought, 'I can't believe I'm dying.' I could hear all the commotion and the doctors and nurses coaching me along to hang in there. I wasn't sure they knew that I was not breathing and I had no way of telling them. After a few minutes, I lost consciousness and that's when a beautiful lady came and took hold of my hand. I didn't know where she was taking me, but I trusted her completely. The next thing I remember is sitting up straight as my breathing tube was pulled out. There was cheering, but I began to cry. I guess they saw me crying and said, 'It's alright, you went through a lot.' They didn't realize that the reason I was crying was that I knew I would never see that lady again, at least in this life. I felt enormous love for her and she for me. I then quickly passed out again and woke two hours later with my dad by my side.
