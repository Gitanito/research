  		              		Experience Description   

    A huge oak tree crashed into my bedroom at 2:37 am in the morning. There was sounds of what seems like a bomb with the glass breaking, wood snapping, electrical wires sparking, and etc.  The ceiling started to cave in and things started falling on top of  my husband and I. 

  After I heard a crash, I saw a pinpoint beam of bright light. I saw  an image of my life as it was flipping fast-forward,  like pages flipping in a book. I saw highlights of my life like the places I traveled to, such as hiking in the Grand Canyon, me on top of Mount Rainier, seeing the rice fields in the farm I used to run around in as a child, and me in Paris with my mom.
  
  Then all of the sudden, I felt like I awoke, but I  could not scream help as I was in a state of shock.  I   saw the ceiling fan quickly descending  as it was swirling around in the air. Miraculously, it stopped midair and did not harm me. I found the huge oak tree next to me.  It missed me by a foot, leaving me  unharmed. I had no cuts or major bruises because my husband and I were covered in three blankets since  it was chilly that  night. We miraculously survived this event. I thank God for giving us another chance to live.
