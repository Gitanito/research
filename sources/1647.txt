 This was started by Malinda Elliott Cramer ( 1844-1906), and was one of the most important New Thought/mental healing magazines.  Cramer had earlier been involved with The Gnostic in San Francisco, and called her variety of New Thought "Divine Science."  As early as 1890 she was offering a series of Lessons in the Science of Infinite Spirit, and the Christ Method of Healing.  In 1888 she and her husband, Frank, began the Divine Science Home School, and in 1892 she organized the International Divine Science Association, a precursor to the International New Thought Alliance.  She died as a consequence of injuries sustained in the San Francisco earthquake.  The early issues of the journal are especially notable because they contain a long novelette by "Eulis" (F.B. Dowd) that illustrates the transition then taking place between the earlier magic of P.B. Randolph and the softer, more mystical approach of New Thought.
