I was at the beach, body surfing for about 30 minutes. I was exhausted because the surf was very rough and there was a very strong undertow. The waves were getting larger but I couldn't get out of the water because of the undertow. I dove under a huge wave hoping that it would carry me to shore. Inside the wave was a tremendous wall of water that hurled me around like clothes in a washing machine. I had absolutely no control of my body as the water slammed me into the ocean floor. I didn't know where the water surface was. The force of the water had knocked all of the air out of my lungs, so I decided that I was not going to make it. 

At this thought, a voice in my head said that all who have died have lived. I began to relax and realized that I didn't need to breathe anymore and the pain of my lungs sucking in water had stopped. I began to feel very warm, sleepy, and was floating in a grey space. I was overwhelmed with a wonderful sense of unconditional love and such a sense of wholeness, of being connected to everything, and of everything being equal to everything else. Then I was floating just below the waves as a point of consciousness. I felt super aware and could see farther and think faster. Then I thought about how my father, who was on the shore, would react to my death. Suddenly, I was above the water surface looking at my father who was scanning the water to see what had happened to me. I knew that he would continue his life just fine without me and that he would get over it. Then I was below that surface again and wondered when my life would flash before me. I felt that there was an invisible someone with me. It was communicated to me a vision of the activities of my short life. It was like it was all in a book with pages flipping by except that the pictures were like little movies. It was a disappointing movie as I was only 17 at the time.

I felt that I had not accomplished what I had come for in this life. It was communicated to me that if I chose to leave my life at this point that I would have to come back and do this all over again. This invisible someone did not have any judgment to offer and I felt that the judgment would come from myself. In fact, I have concluded that this was only myself, a higher version of myself.  At some point, I asked what the purpose of life was and the answer I received was 'to help other people'. Then I began to hear wonderful music, not like any that I have heard in life, I could not identify the instruments or the melody. Next, I could hear some far-off school bells, the sound of which was luring me off to the right and into another dimension from which there would be no turning back. I did not hesitate at this barrier; I had no regrets of leaving anything behind from my life. 

Without warning, I was suddenly and violently sucked down toward my body.  I was still face down on the ocean floor. On the way down, I was told 'It's not your time yet'. Once I was back in my body, I still had no idea where the surface of the water was. Then I actually felt a pair of physical hands, one under each foot, push me to the surface, where I was able to stand up in chest deep water. How very angry I was! I felt so cheated.  I did not want to leave that place to come back to this life. It took me many years to finally get over that anger and forgive God for sending me back to my life. It was never my life in the first place; he was the one who gave me this life.
