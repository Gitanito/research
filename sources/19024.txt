know men are making this this is an
exciting livestream for everybody and I
want to thank everybody who has clicked
in because if you have arrived here you
have clicked in your lightworker you&#39;re
in search of disclosure you&#39;re you&#39;re
wanting knowledge and you are certainly
following a dr. Greer myself over the
years so welcome to everybody that is
here today I&#39;m your host Jimmy church I
am the host of fade to black and of
course fill-in host over at coast to
coast am dr. Greer has been my guest
many times on both programs including I
guess we last week we did coast to coast
together yes you did and it was a it was
another great show and I want to get a
couple of things out of the way because
I want to get straight to chatting with
dr. Greer today in his new film Close
Encounters of the fifth kind if first
off the disclosure fest event that we
have been doing for the last three or
four years here in Los Angeles has grown
to one of the biggest events in the
country last year we had 20,000
attendees it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s at the Los
Angeles Historic Park in downtown LA
this year because of the worldwide
crisis that is going on we are still
scheduled by the state of California and
the city of Los Angeles to go on June
20th
on that Saturday very excited about that
if we have to push back the date we will
let you know here via this live stream
fade to black coast-to-coast and of
course over at disclosure fest org all
along hopefully we&#39;ll be able to be
there I&#39;m planning if they let us that I
would be at that event if it&#39;s at a time
I predict you&#39;ll have to do it in July
or August because June is probably going
to be too soon for a big mass event but
but I&#39;ve talked to Adrian and so it
looks like I might be able to be on
stage there and we&#39;ll have a screening
of the movie and we&#39;ll you know do a
mass meditation there as well I want
everybody to know that you can go to the
disclosure fest dot-org for all of the
scheduling information and any
announcements and all of our initiatives
and of course to donate for all of our
projects that we have going on in Los
Angeles we will have our fade to black
stage there again this year disclosure
fest and of course dr. Greer will be one
of our featured speakers and and
presenters and I&#39;m very excited about
that let&#39;s let&#39;s move forward the film
last week well okay let&#39;s back up two
weeks ago we were supposed to attend
your premiere here in Los Angeles we
know that that didn&#39;t happen but and it
has been rescheduled and I look forward
I had I was at your last premiere here
at same Theatre at the Regal in downtown
LA and when you have that many people
dr. Greer show up for knowledge in
pursuit to see a new film of yours like
that it&#39;s got to make you feel pretty
good but it also lets you know that you
have the support of the community and
that place was packed to the rafters
sorry that we didn&#39;t get to do it this
year I let me walk to it but what what
does that say to you when you have that
kind of support from the public well I
think people are ready i what that says
to me is to plan it his ready and has
been ready to move forward with this and
you know when I founded the disclosure
movement which of course that
conferences that you&#39;re referring to is
named after that was an outgrowth
accidentally as I mentioned to you of
cg5 initiative at close encounters of
the fifth time which is what this
documentary is about but it what it says
is that it&#39;s long overdue the public
wants to know what the truth is
but they also want to do something that
makes a change that isn&#39;t just you know
I think for a lot of people they&#39;re
tired of the whole sitting around in a
conference routine I think what my focus
has always been is a call to action to
do something whether it was the
disclosure project and bringing out
top-secret military people and moving
that information to the public or
organizing the public to make direct
contact with these civilizations because
we need to be able to make direct
contact and bypass the government I call
this cosmic civil disobedience on a very
large scale where we sort of get out of
our homes and out from in front of TVs
and smartphones and computers and
actually go out under the stars together
and learn the techniques of remote
viewing and the ce-5 initiative the
Close Encounters of fifth pine
initiative make contact and let these
civilizations know that there are people
here on this planet who are peaceful who
are enlightened who want to have contact
with them for a better purpose than a
military agenda or a materialistic
agenda let&#39;s say because and that&#39;s
what&#39;s been lacking if you look at the
last 70 years of the so-called UFO
subject
the big problem has always been we&#39;re
always pursuing this at least officially
in a covert way that&#39;s focusing it&#39;s
almost exclusively on a military view of
it and us-versus-them view of it or a
materialistic view and that is gee let&#39;s
see if we can shoot these aircraft down
that are from other star systems
figuring out how they work and make
another better or secret weapon for
Lockheed skunkworks or my uncle&#39;s
company north or Grumman or whoever so I
think we we really are needing to find
what I&#39;m sensing is that more than half
the public believe we&#39;re not alone in
the universe it&#39;s something like 60% 43%
of Americans think we&#39;re currently being
visited
the big number you know it&#39;s like 150
million people so what people don&#39;t know
is what&#39;s really behind the secrecy and
so what you know it&#39;s like so what what
are we gonna do about it and what I&#39;ve
always tried to focus on here&#39;s what we
can do about it
we can take disclosure into our hands
not expect the government but we also
can take interplanetary diplomacy into
our hands in other words you know having
met with UN Secretary General and you
know Foreign Ministries and people in
government all over the world there
isn&#39;t a program a peaceful open contact
between the human species and these
other species we&#39;ve always just been
reactive and so this is where this next
documentary Close Encounters of the
fifth time is is the next thing that we
have to do we let me jump in right there
if I&#39;m a serious and unacknowledged both
broke ground and and they were not only
accepted but some of the most widely
viewed documentaries not only on the
subject of any documentary in history
now Close Encounters of a fifth kind is
out it is a whole new dynamic it&#39;s a
dynamic and visuals both you and the
director Michael Missoula attended to
not only the editing and a big
production feel to it but you&#39;ve got new
material here that has never been
presented before I think that&#39;s more
important than anything when you&#39;re
reaching out to an audience that is
beyond our community right well it
actually also it only shows you what&#39;s
happened in making direct contact over
the last thirty years this is the 2020s
the 30th anniversary of the cg5
initiative when I founded it in nineteen
ninety and we have around a hundred
thousand people around the world doing
it and what we&#39;re trying to do is get
somewhere on the order of 70 or 80
million people why that&#39;s 1% of the
world&#39;s population and
you look at the movie we go through an
explanation of how important that
critical mass is that when people are in
mass consciousness kind of woven
together and they intend to do something
it changes the dynamic of the other 99%
so instead of the 1% elite that are
running the world into the ground let&#39;s
talk about the 1% of people who can put
their focus on enlightenment and contact
and creating a new civilization on this
planet and that to me is what&#39;s really
exciting and that&#39;s the reason I
actually left my medical career is to do
this that the whole disclosure project
was because of a successful ce-5 that
happened on the beach in Florida in
March of 1992 and it ended up on the
front page of the Pensacola paper and
the next thing you know I have are the
head of army intelligence &amp; cie people
contacting me going you know dude what
the hell are you doing at that in
Pensacola we talked about this last week
I think it&#39;s one of the most amazing
images that has ever been captured
you&#39;ve got there&#39;s a couple but
specifically you&#39;ve got something and
when I say et I think that&#39;s the wrong
word you&#39;ve got a being a full-color
being captured and you chose to put this
into the film woody what do you think
the reactions gonna be from everybody
when they see this image of this
intelligent being usually it&#39;s oh my god
astonishment because and by the way that
wasn&#39;t at Pensacola that was at Boca
Grande on the further south on the Gulf
Coast years later that beam was actually
photographed a few years ago in the
2000s the the original event that
happened in Florida was in 92 so that
this was probably 20 years later or 15
years later and that being was is a et
from another star system but they&#39;re
they&#39;re on the order of several hundred
million years more evolved than we are
yeah I thought I did I don&#39;t you look at
it you can tell this is not this is this
is amazing so it was sort of a you know
a lot of things we put in the movie was
pushing the envelope of what people
could get their minds around because
we&#39;re so materialistic we&#39;re thinking
all the time that as species evolved
it&#39;s just sort of like around the edges
of where we are right these these are a
thousand quantum leaps up past their
injuries in mire states of consciousness
most importantly and where their whole
civilization has understood the science
of consciousness and of teleportation
and a manifestation and materialization
almost like you would read and from a
book from the ancient Vedas or a
Sanskrit of what they call cities sidd H
is which are these abilities to
materialize a gym or materialize a whole
city of course humans have evolved to
have those kind of capabilities over the
years periodically but I&#39;m talking about
civilizations were the entire
civilization everyone on the planet is
at that level of conscious enlightenment
and evolution so that&#39;s that&#39;s my point
about this image this image you see the
intelligence and this this this being is
almost speaking to you there is
something going on there there&#39;s a
connection right oh yeah when it was on
the beach we I was it was a ce-5 so in
other words let me tell you the setting
for that one of the problems with a
two-hour documentary is that it&#39;s a tour
de force but there&#39;s no context for a
lot of these images so that since you
brought it up
we had decided to go out on this Beach
with a training team that I had invited
maybe 30 people I was setting up and
arriving and that we do a meditation
privately before we go out as a group to
do a meditation and ce-5 contact and as
we were going onto the beach to set up
this beam materialized inserted
scintillating and this area of light and
III don&#39;t take photos or videos I&#39;m no
good at that so there was a person with
me who I pointed over and saw it set up
his camera took that photograph I didn&#39;t
take it I don&#39;t take you I&#39;ve never
taken a photograph right right I&#39;m all
thumbs I&#39;m fine with a ventilator or a
defibrillator
but forget cameras anyway ro so what
happened is that as soon as it was taken
we looked at me one oh my god it was
such a beautiful image of it and what
happened after that we invited that beam
and a whole bunch of other hope group of
civilizations that work at that level to
join us on the beach that night and then
all kinds of other things happen there&#39;s
an image in there of this ribbon of
light that comes into the group and
wraps around one of the people attending
and goes up from behind an over shoulder
up to her third eye and it looks like a
sort of like this Arrowhead object
you&#39;ve seen this photo I have that&#39;s one
shot of a photo not photoshopped and she
was a medical doctor from Peru and she
was having this amazing enlightenment
experience in this deep meditation I was
guiding when this thing came in so the
kinds of phenomenon and beautiful
experiences we have are beyond the scope
of the movie but it sort of just
introduces the idea but what we&#39;re doing
and the idea that everyone can do it now
I want to put say something we just
released I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve gotten
it yet Jimmy the ce-5 contact app so you
have it you go to your iTunes Store
Google Play there&#39;s a new app that&#39;s
just come out that&#39;s an entire training
program that has the meditations the
remote viewing
techniques the CG five protocols how to
set up a team what do you do when
something happens but also all the
different kinds of phenomenon that
happens all the equipment you want to
have such for example you know that the
software apps that show you what objects
are satellites in the sky so you don&#39;t
mistake a bunch of evil
must satellites that are up there
floating with a flotilla of ET craft so
it&#39;s a very practical how-to guide but
it has something else that&#39;s really cool
and that it has a networking feature so
you can get on in LA and see who else is
in the LA area on the app that you can
think message to to form your own team
so say on any given night once we&#39;re out
of lockdown
you could get together with four or five
people meet up somewhere and do ce-5
together so the idea is that this is
gonna facilitate people forming contact
teams all over the world now one of the
exciting things about the film there&#39;s a
lot of great things about it but is the
amount of video and imaging content that
you have and who made the decision on
what made the film and the terabytes of
of extra stuff that didn&#39;t make it into
the film that&#39;s that&#39;s a tough decision
and we&#39;ll we have a part - a part three
a supplemental documentary of some of
the other stuff that didn&#39;t make it into
the film I hope to sometime I don&#39;t know
how to do video editing and stuff like
that and as you know we don&#39;t have an
office or staff or a budget so let&#39;s say
we raised and by the way thank you to
everyone who contributed to the
crowdfunding this film like all of them
have been crowd funded and right now
this is in the top ten
documentary server crowd fun it&#39;s I
think we&#39;re just hit eight hundred and
nine thousand dollars and so that&#39;s
going into the movie but I don&#39;t have a
staff to be able to take the hundred we
have about a hundred terabytes of
material to take that pull it out and
then put it into other things and even
on even on YouTube we just don&#39;t have
anyone to do that so and I don&#39;t know
how I just don&#39;t do video editing but so
that&#39;s something someday maybe we&#39;ll be
able to do if we found someone competent
to do it but yeah the answered a
question we do want to do that we just
don&#39;t have any personnel to do it who
made a decision about what made it into
the film who made those decision well it
was a whole team effort you know the
producers and Michael Missoula and I
ultimately
I made the decision of things that I
thought were the most representative of
the different kinds of phenomenon that
happened during ce-5 but it&#39;s um a some
of it got to the point there there would
be 10 great images they were very
similar and you just have to choose one
because in a two-hour feature film that
you want to have we&#39;re aiming to have
500 million to 800 million people see
this it&#39;s very very difficult yes
unacknowledged is that over 600 million
people see it right right okay so our
goal is that you know we had to make a
heart it was like you know which arm do
you want to cut off you know when you
had to make this decision there&#39;s a lot
of great content not in there but we we
really wanted to show different a
phenomenon that Illustrated the kinds of
events that happen where there was an ET
nearby and then I call it the healer the
one that has the sort of a praying
mantis shaped triangular head that
healed a man of his hearing loss in our
circle a couple years ago up in Arizona
or so we wanted to have enough things in
there to get people a flavor of the kind
of things that happened but it is an
exhaust that no what&#39;s interesting
though we took every photo in video in
the film and put it into a bonus feature
that goes with the movie when you when
you get it but it&#39;s only available in
two places Vimeo and iTunes the other
platforms don&#39;t allow for bonus features
so people who really want to see that in
an aggregated way where it&#39;s just it&#39;s
25 minutes continuously of amazing
photos and videos of cg5 events if also
god unedited the full interviews from
them too as well yeah there&#39;s a long
interview with me that was done in the
bat-cave or whatever that thing was and
with with also with Danny Sheehan the
constitutional attorney civil rights
attorney who&#39;s on our team and that&#39;s an
amazing interview with Danny
so those are three bonus features that
come with the film but you can&#39;t get it
Amazon doesn&#39;t have it the Google Play
doesn&#39;t have it but iTunes and Vimeo
does so there&#39;s some confusion on that&#39;s
why I&#39;m trying to point that out for
those bonus features which I think
people really interested in disclosure
in contact that&#39;s they&#39;re gonna want
those but it&#39;s the other the reason it&#39;s
not on the other platforms is the other
platforms don&#39;t allow it or it would be
so by the day today which is the what is
today Earth Day the 22nd right today is
the 21st 21st
tomorrow&#39;s Thursday today is the first
day it&#39;s been available for rental right
though the film can just be rented but
unfortunately the rental platforms don&#39;t
allow for these bonus features that are
mind-blowing but you know I don&#39;t have
any control over that that&#39;s you know
you have to talk to whoever owns Apple
and Amazon and want my chicken as they
say in the sale not my chicken honey I
don&#39;t really have the ability to have
any say-so over that and a lot of people
ask you know well is it only EPS I said
no you don&#39;t just slap it on Netflix
they have to approach you and we have no
idea whether Netflix is going to want to
have something like this on their
platform or not but where it is now you
can rent it you can get it on iTunes and
on Vimeo you can get these amazing bonus
features that are not available anywhere
else and I think people are going to
want to get those because when you know
these images are referring to including
this light being and the et that did the
healing and then the Ambassador from the
Andromeda galaxy b-joo that was at
Joshua Tree with us a few years ago all
those are isolated you know in this
bonus feature one image after another
instead of just being scattered through
a two-hour film so it&#39;s really a great
thing for someone to have in their
collection if they&#39;re really into it now
disclosure is a big word you&#39;ve been out
in front pushing for this the community
whatever their definition of disclosure
is
they have been chomping at the bit it
seemed like we were getting really close
over the last few years for something
big to break and I felt and so did many
you and I have talked about this often I
felt that we were ready I really felt
like the world you know that most people
were saying I mean the common my friends
that are not part of the UFO community
saying of course we&#39;re not alone but
this was expected of course what did you
think well today the reaction from this
is the elephant in the room right the
reaction from coronavirus and the
shutting down of economies and the
crisis that we&#39;re all being forced to go
through right now makes me almost take a
step back and say are we could we handle
the truth are we really ready for this
is coronavirus helping us understand how
we can react to something on a worldwide
scale and maybe handle real disclosure
in a different way what&#39;s your take
after after what we&#39;ve gone through in
the last couple of months is the world
ready for for real real disclosure yeah
but you have to define real disclosure
you know the first part of this film
exposes the covert clandestine message
and narrative narrative of what&#39;s been
going on with some of the disclosure
efforts that have hijacked let&#39;s call it
the movement that I started in the 1990s
to do this and specifically you know the
tick-tack and the stuff that came out
from the Pentagon and T TSA we&#39;re on
every single major media outlet in the
world mainstream media this was
portrayed as a threat an alien threat a
threat to our national security now you
know all the way back to the late 1990s
early 2000s we&#39;ve been talking about
that Verner von Braun who invented the
rock at fade off Hitler and others that
I&#39;ve worked with have said frankly this
has always been the long-term objective
of the Cabal keeping the secret these so
called unacknowledged special access
projects
but what people don&#39;t realize those
operations always stay in the shadows
they get cut outs people that are sort
of carrying their water for them that
are the visible tip of that spear and
that&#39;s what&#39;s unfortunately started
happening which we also had predicted in
the 1990s because to be very blunt with
you I took meetings in the 90s with
people who were key members of that
committee of the majority intelligence
committee Menten magic as it&#39;s called
used to be called majestic 12 but it&#39;s
called magic maj I see and it was made
very clear to me that that was the
agenda and that there that there would
be an acculturation project that would
pick up steam and then they would move
the narrative in the direction of fear
panic and a threat now it&#39;s our job to
sort of say
I think we have got a video interruption
with dr. Greer and and I&#39;m not sure what
everybody else is seeing right now so
I&#39;m gonna wait patiently here we&#39;re
talking about you know is the world
ready for actual disclosure and the
definition of that is different for
everybody for me I&#39;ve seen what I&#39;ve
seen
I don&#39;t need an actual sitting head of
state to jump on live television at a
podium to say we&#39;re not alone in the
universe
but that is what most people expect and
that is their definition of disclosure I
can see that the screen has shifted now
and I am here with all of you so we will
wait patiently for a dr. Greer to come
back online also so that&#39;s that&#39;s you
know what what is real disclosures
you&#39;re not only for you but for
everybody else and there&#39;s different
subjects what we&#39;re talking about
disclosure too as well it&#39;s not just the
UFO question and what does the
government know that that is one part of
disclosure disclosure covers quite a few
different things also oh I wanted to
just say to everybody I&#39;m broadcasting
live from here in Burbank and you can
see I am here in in my studio where I
broadcast from every day with fade to
black
I don&#39;t broadcast from with
coast-to-coast from here I do that over
at the coast studios also here in in
Southern California but one of the
things that happens in this studio and
and others is when we are talking about
these sensitive issues like this things
happen with the transmission and I don&#39;t
react anymore
you used to its the knock things over
and get upset when when things get
interrupted it is just part of the gig
it&#39;s part of the gig before I started
doing the you
follow subjecting conspiracies and other
things that I talked about I never had
any issues with with broadcasting and
not a click a blip nothing at all
and once I started doing these types of
shows and fade to black and Costa Kevin
Lee computers are acting funny cell
phones are acting funny internet
attacking funny phones if just things
are just and the first time it happened
I got pretty upset because I wasn&#39;t used
to it today as soon as and with dr.
Greer&#39;s happened with me more than once
as soon as things start to get into a
sensitive issue like we were just
speaking about right here BAM an
interruption and what were we talking
about we were talking about what
disclosure really is and what has been
happening over the last couple of years
and and how the how the public would
react to that and what is the government
know as soon as we get into that
sensitive issue he gets pulled off the
air and this is what happens I am so
used to it now I want to uh so we&#39;ll
wait for dr. Greer to come back online I
want to shift gears a little bit and go
back to the film I&#39;ve seen the film
three times I have now interviewed dr.
Greer twice in the last month both on
fade to black and coast-to-coast am
announcing the the release of the film
the film for me is and this is why I
think everybody should see it not only
in our UFO community because you&#39;ll get
a lot out of it we&#39;ve all seen UFO
documentaries in the past and it&#39;s a lot
of material is is rehash because when
you study in research as much as we do
in the community there&#39;s only so many
cases out there and and information and
video and images and witnesses and
interviews hey I&#39;m not hey I was I was
one very big shoes man
yeah man you&#39;re doing great I&#39;m sorry
you know what we&#39;re live
in the Blue Ridge Mountains and we&#39;re
having a crazy windstorm and the power
went out briefly and it shut off the
internet saying you can you can blame
the weather I blame a great letter
agencies because the same thing happened
Saturday night and I was actually in a
city and we were I was just getting to
the story about the Randalls from forest
Bentwaters event right we&#39;re an
interstellar vehicle landed and it was
actually the the meeting that officers
had that never got republic repeated to
the public it&#39;s not in the disclosure
project materials because they didn&#39;t
want to talk about it but the colonel
who was there air force us normal halt
the I won&#39;t say which one they were more
than going down we did not want to
because this is a bridge too far right
it has to do with contact and I was just
getting to the part of the story where I
was saying that that pyramid shape black
onyx craft that landed at Bentwaters was
actually the descendants of Homo sapiens
humans who had become interstellar ets
from five hundred thousand years in the
future and they came back and they
became we it was this luminous glowing
beam that floated through this black
onyx type pyramid that had landed there
in the Rendlesham forest the Bentwaters
Air Force Base in England he was 1980 or
81 and the et told the officers there
that they were our descendants from way
in the future but that base was a secret
nuclear weapons base that was in
violation of treaties and if that had
gotten out it could have caused World
War three and the ETS which were again
people say where they eat here Hume and
I said well they were extraterrestrial
beings were but it was from when humans
had gone from planet earth out through
the cosmos and had he evolved and
evolved and evolved and evolved and just
looked like a tall luminous
a white beam that floated through the
side of this spacecraft warning about
what we were doing to the planet and
that&#39;s when the signal was cut off on
Saturday when I was doing a global cg5
event are you used to it now right when
you get to the point right you&#39;re right
at the edge ya know so R and then BOOM
yeah who cares it&#39;s just goes with the
territory anyways I got it back up
hopefully we don&#39;t get cut off again I&#39;m
hoping well okay so we were certain help
us circle back we were discussing
disclosure in and what it is to
different people I I wanted to share
this with you 15 seconds wait I&#39;m at a
conference I&#39;ve got 2,000 people in
front of me and I said I don&#39;t need
disclosure mm-hmm I got booed and and I
it wasn&#39;t that I got booed for saying
what I said most people&#39;s expectations
of what disclosure is is you&#39;ve got a
head of state stepping up to a podium
live television we are not alone in the
universe and we know this this this
that&#39;s the disclosure that they need so
the world handle that kind of live
presentation oh sure I mean that kind of
disclosure the public could handle if
it&#39;s told in a way that&#39;s truthful so as
you know a couple years ago I actually
wrote a statement for various world
leaders to do exactly that I was asked
to do one for Putin one for Trump and
and so we sent that out there is that on
the internet somewhere and exactly how
it should be worded and everything else
I&#39;m not a world leader and don&#39;t want to
be you know I&#39;d be the worst politician
ever to walk on planet Earth but by far
the worst absolutely why force me you
don&#39;t know me well enough everyone I
couldn&#39;t put up with it for in it for a
New York
second but what my point is is that if
they stand up there are two kinds of
there&#39;s a battle going on here
there&#39;s the disclosure of the truth that
we&#39;re not alone
that they&#39;re waiting for us to make
contact there&#39;s no evidence that they
are hostile because if they were or we&#39;d
know it by now but and there&#39;s so
there&#39;s that disclosure that would be
unifying hopeful forward-looking
vendor&#39;s disclosure that the charlatans
in UF ology and the covert programs want
which is we&#39;re being invaded by aliens
they violated our national security
they&#39;re here to eat us for lunch they&#39;re
here doing all these horrible nefarious
things that disclosure would send the
planet into something an order of
magnitude worse than the corona virus so
the quest your question is whose
disclosure what disclosure for a
disclosure that&#39;s being run by people
who are frankly imbeciles or on the
other hand have a ax to grind where
they&#39;re trying to prop up the
military-industrial complex remember
that name from Eisenhower so that
everyone unites around a global
superpower military against the aliens
in other words that&#39;s what Verner von
Braun warned about the guy who invented
that the rock afraid of Hitler he warned
that what they really want to do is
create a global unification around
militaristic centralized power agendas
not global enlightenment and peace the
opposite of that so I&#39;m saying that we
have a choice but we don&#39;t have a choice
if we&#39;re not educated and moreover the
real disclosure that needs to happen at
this point I mean remember I started
doing briefings for the Clinton
administration and the director of the
CIA for Bill Clinton in 1993 we&#39;re
talking 27 years ago I started taking
meetings with the head of Army
Intelligence in 92 28 years ago so from
my
from where I sit in the kinds of
meetings I&#39;ve attended with people who
are in power the solution I see isn&#39;t
some world leader being manipulated to
stand in a podium to scale that scare
the hell out of the public which is most
likely what would happen it&#39;s us we the
people by passing these dysfunctional
corrupt governments and making direct
contact with these civilizations but we
have to know how is that done
who are we contacting what is their
technology and their technology is
firmly rooted in the science of
consciousness as soon as a civilization
achieves level one civilization meaning
there are peaceful on their planet and
they&#39;re not destroying the biosphere to
have a high-tech civilization that
they&#39;re very have evolved to being a
real civilization which we do not have
we&#39;re still fighting we&#39;re still
destroying the biosphere or very
dysfunctional but once it becomes a
level one civilization the number one
growth and scientific endeavor is the
development of the science of
consciousness and all the technologies
that go there with they go with it but
to have those develop properly you have
to have people who are actually
experiencing and understanding what
field consciousness is that the field of
consciousness where you&#39;re awake and I&#39;m
awake were unique individuals they&#39;re
like snowflakes no two are alike
however the conscious field that enables
me to be awake and you to be awake that
is a singularity that&#39;s why when that
the famous physicist Erwin Schrodinger
said the total number of minds in the
universe is one
it&#39;s a singularity one and that&#39;s been
proven scientifically over and over and
over again and one of the cool things
about this movie the Close Encounters of
the fifth kind movie is that we do sort
of a tour de force of the scientific
experiments that have been done that
show that consciousness in mind isn&#39;t
limited to your skull or to face or to
time and you know people can go in my
youtube channel
you with Russell Targ two weeks ago when
the movie premiered from our home
because we couldn&#39;t go out so we did a
little home premiere that virtually on
YouTube and you know he talks about this
and the fact that the science of this is
settled science that proves that
consciousness and even thought they&#39;re
not limited to the speed of light to
time to space to matter well if you&#39;re
going faster than the speed of light as
an interstellar civilization you have to
have mastered that science to go from
point A to B what&#39;s called nonlocality
the fact that you&#39;re not in a straight
line in space-time but that you&#39;re
actually communicating even traveling
through other dimensions that are
increasingly dimensions of field
consciousness and so-called astral
energy like the body of light that you
have an out-of-body experience with or a
lucid flying dream so that that sounds
like mysticism but it isn&#39;t it&#39;s
mystical only if you don&#39;t understand it
so I always tell people one person&#39;s
mysticism and magic is another
civilizations equivalent of a cellphone
just everyday but that&#39;s what we have to
understand what we have to understand is
we&#39;re not dealing with you know a
souped-up version of a 747 we&#39;re dealing
with civilizations whose spacecraft
communication systems etc are all
emanating from a deeper understanding of
let&#39;s call it the elementals of
space-time matter that are rooted in the
consciousness field and we have put
everything upside down
we think consciousness is a result for
brainwave activity for in reality the
body and all of matter in space and time
is and the result of the consciousness
field moving into other dimensions it&#39;s
complete ours this is the whole problem
the fundamental problem is that our
understanding we have been miss talked
about this and so we have to begin to
get an understanding
that accounts for in my opinion at least
part of the way to what an interstellar
civilization that&#39;s moving beyond the
speed of light but in the film I call it
the crossing point of light which is a
chapter in the first book I wrote
extraterrestrial contact
and where I describe what is in the
cosmos that is phasing resonating at
frequencies beyond the speed of light it
turns out most of creation most of the
cosmos is in that field that&#39;s beyond 3d
matter of space and time but we&#39;ve been
ignoring it because up until recently we
really haven&#39;t had the ability to
scientifically verify it or understand
it or understand the ability to
understand if you look at the ancient
Vedas if you look at the ancient shamans
of Native American culture if you look
at people from all over the world
aboriginals in Australia with Dreamtime
no doubt we humans have a real deep
understanding if you do an ethnography
and a study of different cultures of
this what you find is in fact there&#39;s an
amazing level of contact and
understanding of these other dimensions
that are in the human experience but in
the modern scientific age we kind of
threw that baby out with the bathwater
because that stuff got associated so
much with superstition which walls and
and dumb stuff so now we&#39;re at a point
where we can bring the knowledge of all
this the pure knowledge of it together
with the scientific understanding and
where we&#39;re going to go beyond this sort
of dualism of spirituality versus
science but why don&#39;t they ask you this
we I think we can all feel this paradigm
shift that we&#39;re going on not to go back
and visit coronavirus but it&#39;s a test of
this planet right now and how we are
reacting to a real crisis and how Wayne
managed to come together do you think
that et is watching do you think that et
is checking up on us to see how we deal
with this all the time in real
right yeah no question I have no doubt
that there&#39;s continuous monitoring
everything that goes on on this planet
what they&#39;re waiting for is to see if
humans can get to the point of
functioning in a way that would be
suitable for open contact that&#39;s what
the whole model of Close Encounters of
the fifth kind is for sure I mean
they&#39;re monitoring all of this my
concern is whether the coronavirus
reaction never mind
the origins of the virus which is
another whole discussion I&#39;d rather not
get into what but which we know what
that is
yep definitively dispositively there&#39;s
no question but the point is is a the
reaction to it for example if a man goes
fishing on a lake in Michigan with his
son and gets arrested with a misdemeanor
and fined $1,000 this is the most
egregious outrageous abuse of state
power all right so what happens when a
civilization can be stampeded through
fear into a ceding to an overreach let&#39;s
call it of statism authoritarianism
fascism I this is what is most
concerning to me about the freeing of
hours be it the opportunity that has
been presented to you the timing of the
release of the film and with this
consciousness connectivity that&#39;s going
around the planet right now and people
are at home watching material right
more than ever before what a great
opportunity the universe has a weird way
of making things happen doesn&#39;t ya the
universe works in mysterious ways and
like what you know it is a good time I
mean you know now it&#39;s available for
rental people don&#39;t want to buy it they
can see it with their family right and
it&#39;s I I saw a beautiful tweet today it
actually made me cry there was a man who
was at home who was watching the sea
the Close Encounters of the fifth kind
initiative with his young boy and that
the child was so engrossed with even if
they didn&#39;t understand all the intellect
of it with what what the story was and
that it was this great experience
because he wanted his son to have this
mind expanding experience and the boy
was having that experience and and that
they were going to go out in their yard
and do the contact so what I see is that
you know you&#39;re if you&#39;re given lemons
you make lemonade we&#39;re all kind of
locked down under virtual house arrest
so but this is an opportunity to learn
educate learn the meditations meditate
together get on these technologies are
helpful for doing group meditations
together like for example with the ct5
contact app you might find ten people in
your neighborhood or area and say hey
let&#39;s do a zoom it&#39;s some night and sit
and unzoom all do the meditation and do
context see what happens in our this
part of our city you might be surprised
now would be great it&#39;d be great permit
for people I&#39;m gonna ask a question like
we&#39;re going over over everybody we
started late we&#39;re just gonna keep this
going for a few minutes the one question
that I think everybody would expect me
to ask or hope that I would ask is this
the release of this film have you gotten
any reaction from Washington the
Pentagon surely they all don&#39;t know that
the film is out and they have watched it
what do you think that reaction is and
have has anybody reached out to you yes
I mean I&#39;ve heard from a few people in
the government who have said this is
just what we want this is amazing most
of the people I hear from or what I call
the friendlies the white hats who want
to see disclosure happen want to see us
move off of this sort of terminal
velocity that we&#39;re on as a planet where
we&#39;re destroying everything willy-nilly
so what the feedback I have seen has
been really encouraging
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some folks very unhappy
about it would you tell me if you got
that phone call oh I don&#39;t need to get a
phone call they they make your ways and
and right right you know I mean you know
is about the time the film was coming
out I had a helical if in the middle of
nowhere hundreds of miles from any
military base in a military gunship
Hubbard and came over the house and you
know who cares you know I just wave and
go high or maybe I&#39;ll moon them no I
won&#39;t do that oh well there&#39;s another
part of this we touched upon it earlier
yeah which is fear and fear is what gets
the clicks for for the media its what
advertisers paid for they want
viewership and they get their
advertising in there well fear comes in
many different forms but they certainly
have been playing the fear card when it
comes to et a UFO presence not only in
our airspace but that now it&#39;s
threatening our military and our good
men and women of the military can have
these threats the fear card has been
played hasn&#39;t well that was always the
plan this is why it was kept secret and
they&#39;re gonna play it more and more
unless people wake up and go we&#39;re not
going to be deceived by you anymore but
unfortunately you know if you look at
what happened after 9/11 they had the
Patriot Act no one in the Congress read
it it allowed for a warrantless
surveillance all kinds of
unconstitutional breaches of our
liberties so what we have to learn we as
as a community not just people
interested in UFOs but as a human
collective we have to realize when
demagogues who benefit from fear and war
and centralized control and the loss of
people&#39;s real freedoms we have to
realize when we&#39;re being played and
deceived so it&#39;s a game of deception and
the only way to see through that is to
have an awakening where you can see what
the deception is
but also you&#39;re not relying on second
third fourth hand looks like we lost dr.
Greer again right when we get to the
sensitive stuff unbelievable I&#39;m used to
it though I&#39;m used to it where I was
going to go next and I don&#39;t know if
we&#39;re gonna get dr. Greer back in time
we have to also continue over with my
co-host Michelle Anderson on another
live stream the second half of this live
stream but where I was going to go was
this I&#39;ll leave you with this unless we
can get dr. Greer back is that this film
is cinematic he mentioned the Batcave
earlier he is not in front of a green
screen
Michael missoula shot this film with a
full cinematic presentation and in a
field and that is important to the rest
of the world they need to want to see
the film and and have their interest
stay engaged throughout the film on how
do you do that you need to have great
editing you have to have great content
you have to have a cinematic high
production feel to it and dr. Greer
sitting in the Batcave hosting this film
from a set like that is a visual treat
it&#39;s absolutely amazing to see so when
you watch the film and you see dr. Greer
in this ginormous set I want you to
remember this isn&#39;t some
computer-generated effect all right
that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on here he is
actually sitting in the back aid so just
mental note to self when you see that
that&#39;s pretty incredible
and I think that is what&#39;s most
important about this film is that us we
see UFO documentaries inhaling and
eating documentaries all the time they
are fine this film pushes out and goes
beyond our community so for our
community we can sit back and go if this
is great this is great I&#39;m proud of this
anybody can watch
this it&#39;s the rest of the world that
sees this film that will be able to stay
engaged and absorb the material for the
first time I think is the most important
thing where this film and the timing of
its release with what this planet is
going through it could be more more
opportune time so with that I am going
to sign off and I want to thank dr.
Greer for coming in today
the film is Close Encounters of the
fifth kind available from 1091 films Oh
special thanks to the Jim Martin of
course Michael Missoula for their work
on the film Jim Martin and his support
of not only dr. Greer but this community
cannot be overstated
thank you Jim Martin thank you Michael
Missoula
coming up next oh you&#39;re back I was just
thanking everybody yeah went down the
list again
folks I apologize well you know we&#39;re
living in a time where we&#39;re still using
a grid from the late 1800s what a
zero-point energy where every home would
have its own reliable power source so
again I live down the Blue Ridge
Mountains west of the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville Virginia and
we&#39;re having a crazy windstorm that
keeps having the power go in and out but
you know I&#39;d like to do more but I think
this wind storm is getting worse so
maybe while we&#39;re ahead of the game and
I can still say goodbye to everyone we
want to do a brute mass meditation
sometime but everyone who&#39;s listening on
your side and with Adrienne disclosure
fest my youtube channel is youtube.com
slash dr. Steven Greer 55 dr ste ve and
GRE ER 55 and you know you can subscribe
there I think we have close to 300
thousand subscribers we&#39;re gonna start
doing more and more of these and hey if
anyone has a good idea for a powerpack
only for the router so when the power
goes out it still works
so there&#39;s can uninterrupted power to a
to a Internet router let me know because
I think that&#39;s what we need the Internet
is actually okay it&#39;s the power running
the router keeps cutting coughs oh hey
any any geniuses out there with the tech
stuff give me a jingle because I&#39;m sort
of a Luddite I&#39;m not very good with this
thing
yeah I&#39;ve got battery power in here I
run six computers in the studio right
everything is on battery power if it
gets interrupted for whatever reason
yeah we condemn we&#39;re out how to do that
hear that now that we&#39;re I&#39;m locked in
at home and I&#39;m not in a professional
studio I&#39;m just in my living room you
see my met the fireplace behind me yeah
it would be nice no I wanted to I did go
through and and and thank Jim Martin of
course Michael Missoula and that in the
team over 1091 the the point for me that
I want to drive home to everybody is the
cinematic value that is packaged with
this film you are as a member of the UFO
community you can sit back and go I am
proud of this this I show to anybody
this is absolutely tremendous and so for
our community that&#39;s great but the rest
of the world is going to see this and
they are going to stay engaged the
production value for anybody today as
you know dr. Greer is high if you don&#39;t
have the BRIT you&#39;re not gonna keep
people&#39;s attention well you&#39;ve managed
to do that with this film for the first
time I want to ask you as you sit back
are you happy are you happy with what
you&#39;re seeing is this the moment where
you can go you know what I think I think
we hit this one yes I am I mean what
course anyone who&#39;s worked with me knows
I&#39;m a bit of perfectionist and I don&#39;t
stop until I get the best I can out of
the team hey you know I&#39;m gonna
traumatize so you know you know you&#39;re
saving life so I tend to be as sort of I
had very very high standards and Michael
and the production team and I want to
say also
the graphics guy who worked with us on
this mr. Bishop we had jeremy piven do
the narration who is the air eagle
character on Entourage entourage and and
then we had great music composer and we
used some music that we license that was
fun too that makes it interesting and
moves it along I what I really also want
to thank that all the ce-5 teams that
appear in and out of it there are a lot
of people from the cg5 community who are
in the film and who also sent footage a
great deal of the images and photos
weren&#39;t ones where I was there and the
reason I wanted to include a lot of that
was because I wanted people to realize
that I&#39;m not important in this I could
drop dead and this could still be done
by anybody because the truth of the
matter is is that if you&#39;re a human
being your birthright is that you&#39;re
awake and conscious you can connect to
that quiet mind and meditation and then
invite the ETS to come and interact with
you that&#39;s all it is it&#39;s very simple
and most people think that you have to
be like some luminary in the psychic
community like Ingo Swann or the the
people who did all the remote viewing
for the CIA and nothing could be further
from the truth
Russell Targ and also Ingo Swann and I
talked about this every single person
can do it it&#39;s sort of what Yogananda
said when he says it&#39;s the lack of
spiritual adventuresome nests where
people just aren&#39;t willing to try things
and be adventuresome and get out of
their comfort zone a little and
experiment and and if you give yourself
a little bit of leeway to do that then
amazing things can happen will you his
first has think you have to give
yourself permission you have to believe
in yourself I always tell people the
very first thing is you have to say to
yourself hey other people have done this
I can do it too
that was my approach as a 17 18 year old
kid when I was learning meditation I
said well I&#39;m just gonna do it you know
I want to thank you for everything the
the website is Cee five films
dot-com right disclosure fest dot-org
dr. Greer will be out here June 20th a
disclosure fest org we will be
presenting there as to as well I&#39;ve been
hosting that event for a long time and
we are very excited to finally have you
out here in Los Angeles and will will
get to go out and break some bread once
again thank you so much good that can
happen if not we&#39;ll do it later in the
summer you got it dr. Steven Greer thank
you so much
all right amazing really all right I&#39;m
gonna hand things off to Michelle
Anderson over on our line
