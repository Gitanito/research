  		Experience Description

TOUCHED BY ETERNITY: A True Story of Heaven, Healing, and Angels  Click here to check it out


  I have had three near-death experiences (NDE) all precipitated by health conditions. My first NDE occurred on October 16, 1998 in Toronto while my OB/GYN was attending to me. My second NDE took place on November 3, 2015 at a hospital while being treated for a pinched nerve. My third NDE happened at home on June 24, 2017 following dental surgery. I didn’t even know of the term NDE until in 2017 when I decided to go public on social media and a friend enlightened me. I will relate the first NDE only one given the numerous details for all three. 

  Weight loss, nausea, and vomiting had marked the entire first trimester of my pregnancy in 1998. The name of this debilitating morning sickness is hyperemesis gravidarum, but I was sick day and night, and not just mornings. 

  Smell was my worst enemy and the nausea washed over me from food, cologne, toothpaste, and everyday household products. Taste conspired with smell to whirl my head in dizzy circles, so the morsels of toast and milk I attempted were rejected before I could swallow them. The calcium needed for my baby’s bones lay in a putrid mess in the little pail next to the bed. Water morph to pungency that spewed from my mouth as soon as the glass was set to my lips. Popsicles relieved me for an hour before the biliousness would rise again. Nothing stayed in my stomach and I dry-heaved every few minutes.  

  All my senses were against me. The mere viewing of food advertisements stirred queasiness,  so the television remained a dark screen. A kind friend used to prepare meals for my husband since cooking and microwaving were strictly banned at our house, but when the phone would ring for him to pick up the food, like Pavlov’s dogs would salivate at the ring of a bell, I began to nauseate at the ring. Sounds were greatly amplified and I could not listen to music or the Bible on tape. Reading was out of the question. 

  The wafts from the kitchens of the other residents in the building where we lived sent me into revulsion, and no amount of sealing of the windows could prevent the abhorrence from seeping in. Daily I threw up—five times, fifteen times, twenty times. So violent was the retching that I expected to see the baby spew in the pail. 

  October 16th dawned a crisp Friday in autumn with the sun yellow in the sky. I was 13 weeks pregnant and weighed a sorry 95 pounds.   'You are dehydrated. You are not well,' Dr. Im exclaimed as soon as he looked at me. Eyeliner and mascara could not hide illness from his expert gaze, filled with concern. 

  'You need home care.' Dr. Im’s tone was urgent and he picked up the phone to arrange for a nurse to come to our address. He explained the reason for his call and was placed on hold. Suddenly the call was disconnected. He redialed, outlining the immediacy of the situation. One more time the call was dropped, perhaps in an attempt to transfer it. I felt valued by his empathy and determination to get a nurse to attend to me at home. A third time this wonderful doctor dialed the number, but I never knew if he got a hold of the department. For at that moment, I slumped forward on his desk. 

  Simultaneous with my memory of slumping on the doctor’s desk is one where I am walking uphill on soft green grass. The place is bright as if the sun is full out and it is daytime. On my right a huge person strides, and I walk in His shadow. The shadow encompasses me in a circle, similar to the way the midday sun casts a shadow around a person, as opposed to the evening when shadows are long. I feel as if I know Him. I know where I am. I am in Heaven in the Shadow of the Almighty, as spoken of in Psalm 91.

  I do not see Him, but I know He is there. It’s as if knowledge enters my mind at the particular time I need to know something. We do not speak, but we seem to know each other’s thoughts. Our communication is a wordless language through this transfer of thoughts. We walk unhurriedly. There is no haste and no strain of climbing uphill—it is as effortless as walking on level ground. There is no path, yet we walk in the same direction, purposeful of where we are going on the wide-open, grassy space. The green is a shade I’ve not seen before and, as such, is indescribable. The words do not exist in my vocabulary. The hue has more yellow than I’ve seen on earth. 

  I walk at my usual pace, taking small steps, and He keeps up with me. One would expect that a person as large as He would have a big stride, but although He is much bigger than I am, and towers at my side, our paces never fall out of sync, nor does it appear that He is slowed down. 

  We are in a large meadow and the expanse before me is vast. Far ahead of us are trees, vibrant, healthy, green trees, but not deep, dark forest green as on earth. The colors in Heaven do not exist on earth and hence I cannot assign them a name. The colors are brighter and happier and rapturous to my eyes. Above us it’s cloudless. Clear. It reminds me of a tropical day in the Caribbean, except there is no heat to drain my energy. There is no wind either. The temperature is ideal. Everything in this unimaginable, indescribable place is perfect.

   The person walking with me leads to me to the top of the hill and I sit down. His shadow still hovers over me, as if shading me even though there is no heat to burn my skin. A most incredible sense of peace permeates this 'heaven-o-sphere', as I call the atmosphere of Heaven.

 Words may yet have to be created to describe Heaven. My words cannot do justice as they fall short of what Heaven is. Parts of speech fail to deliver the emotions of being in Heaven because Heaven is an experiential concept rather than a theoretical one. A picture might convey details, but I have no pictures to show as the pictures are embedded in my consciousness.

  Peace fills me and pulsates through my being, settling in every hidden part of my insides, into my cells, bones, nerves, and fibers. The entire meadow is laden with peace. Such astounding peace can only be felt, not described. Even if one thinks of his or her most relaxed and refreshing moment on earth, it would be but an imitation of Heaven’s peace. 

  Where I am, there is no sense of time. Time as we know it on earth is linear and irreversible. Not in Heaven. There is no dimension to time. All is still. I inhale deeply. I am contented and satisfied in ways I could have never imagined as I absorb this quietude. I have no pain. I have no worries. I do not remember any sorrow. There is no hint of things negative. 

  I gaze around. Down the hill the meadow tapers out to flat land. A lone tree with a giant trunk stands in the middle of the even ground. The tree is huge, with branches at the very top that spread out like a gigantic, living umbrella. I recall pictures of similar ones I’ve seen in the African savannah, or the real ones at Busch Gardens in Florida. 

  Under the tree a group of children are playing a game. They are far from me, yet I can see the details. I have perfect vision in Heaven, and there’s no need for the one contact lens I wear in my left eye. Interestingly, I do not squint in the light as I do on earth with the astigmatism in my eye. I am able to see things close up as well as I can see them far away. 

  There are about a dozen children ranging in age from perhaps two years old to eight, and three teens are interspersed among them. The scene reminds me of a babysitting one, where the older children take the younger ones out to play. The children are dressed with short-sleeved clothing, and they all wear socks and shoes. The little boys wear shorts into which their shirts are neatly tucked, and the girls are in dresses of white or soft pastel shades of blue, yellow, pink, or green. The children are holding hands and moving in a circle in a counter-clockwise direction. Again, they have no sense of rush, no push, only calm and gentleness. 

  From my spot on the hill I am drawn to a little girl wearing a pale green dress with puffed sleeves, white socks, and black shoes. She may be a taller two year old or a smaller four year old. I cannot see her face as her back is to me. On her right side is a little blond boy with a white shirt tucked into his khaki pants who also looks about four years old. On her left is a little girl in pink about the same age. To the left of the girl in pink is a young teen dressed in a blue skirt that falls below her knee in midi-style, paired with a white blouse. She wears flat shoes but no socks. On the opposite side of the circle is a little girl in buttery yellow. The sight is precious and I let out a sigh of contentment. It is beautiful and perfect. No one shouts, there is no noise, only quiet. No one pushes or is impatient. Unlike the typical scenes at playgrounds on earth, the children are in sync with each other. 

  Suddenly the little girl in the green dress stumbles and falls. Her hand is still held by the blond boy and the girl in pink on either side of her. Everyone pauses, the circle stops. No one speaks, but each knows what to do. The teen extricates her hands from the ones she had been holding and joins their hands together so the circle is still unbroken. She goes over to the fallen child and ever so gently picks her up. 

It’s played out as in slow motion. There is no sense of hurry in this wonderful place, but time seems to slow even more as she picks up the child. I am spellbound by all the little ones, fascinated at how mature they are, but my interest in the little girl who fell is more acute than for the rest. I feel I know this child. 

  The little girl is upright again and stable on her feet. The teen goes back to her spot and the children continue to move counter-clockwise in the circle. 

  I keep drawing in deep breaths and exhaling them with sighs of satisfaction, as if I can’t get enough of this peaceful stillness. This beauty, these colors, the children. I, who had been alone, imprisoned on a sick bed with unquenchable thirst, find my release in the tranquility and calm. Here I am with children and Almighty God in this perfect, flawless meadow, my mind relaxed, my body at rest. 

Unfettered, with no cares, no pain, no worries, only goodness and perfection and health. This is all I desire. This is where I belong. This is what I had believed and lived for, and this is where I want to be. 

  The thought comes that it is natural for Heaven to be filled with peace, because Jesus is Peace and He is there. Peace as we know it on earth is a noun, but Peace in Heaven is a Person and, according to Isaiah 9:6, has a name—Prince of Peace. Here He envelopes me so I am inundated, filled and overflowing with Him. It’s the difference between what is felt on earth and in Heaven. If Jesus brings snatches of His peace to me on earth, they are but a taste of what I’ll have in Heaven. 

  Up to now there has been no verbal communication in the meadow, no human voice, but without warning I become aware that I am talking.   'I don’t want to go back,' I protest aloud. 'I want to stay here.' 

  I am being pulled away. But this unbelievable peacefulness my ninety-five-pound body ached for and finally found is mine, and no one is going to take it away.

  'I don’t want to go back,' I beg again. But it is too late. 

  'YOU MUST COME BACK.' 

  The voice is soft, but carries a finality I cannot argue with. The words hold complete authority. I have no choice. 

  Faster than any speed I could imagine, I find myself receding from Heaven, sucked back to somewhere. Someone is at my side, but not as close as when we walked in the meadow. The way back looks like a dark road spiraling as in a drawing—widest at the Heaven top, but fish-tailing to thin nothingness at the other end. I feel as if I am flying backwards, my face towards Heaven, my feet pointing in the direction I am traveling. I am in a horizontal position, whizzing through the air at this speed that I cannot measure but which feels like the twinkling of an eye as described in 1 Corinthians 15:52.

  Still mumbling that I wanted to stay, I opened my eyes to see Dr. Im’s and my husband’s faces hovering over mine. I was lying on a narrow bed in an examination room in the clinic, whereas when I left earth I had been sitting on a chair in Dr. Im’s office. 

  Which one of them had requested that I come back? 

  I remember asking my husband about the incident the same day, but did not record the details. I’ve regretted that I didn’t pay better attention to this unusual occurrence. He says I was out, unconscious for maybe three minutes. When I collapsed on the desk, he lifted me and took me to an examination room as directed by Dr. Im. He placed me on the bed and the doctor adjusted it so my head was down and my feet were up. My husband described how the doctor kept me this way for about a minute, and then adjusted the bed to bring my head up again.   Dr. Im gave me something to drink. My husband recalls their communication, how the doctor said more than once, 'We are losing her,' because he couldn’t find my pulse and heartbeat. My husband explained that when I regained consciousness I appeared to be in a daze and said to them, 'I was in Heaven.'

  I remember murmuring those words too. He said they both had listened but neither asked me any questions. My husband said he had been praying from the moment I collapsed and all the time I was in Heaven. I know his faith, and I know his prayer is the reason I was brought back to earth. Such is the power of prayer—God hears and answers.

  That day, October 16, 1998, I was healed of hyperemesis gravidarum and started to eat and gain weight after visiting Heaven. I never threw up again for the rest of my pregnancy. I also came back with a second miraculous healings. I have medical records to prove my healings.

  I had not been pronounced clinically dead.  What happened to me was what I would learn nineteen years later is termed a near-death experience (NDE) as described in the earlier in the book, a visit to the afterlife. My first out-of-the-body experience (OOB).

  After my third NDE on June 24th, 2017, I was consumed afresh with the details of my first visit to Heaven. I wanted to tell my story accurately so I asked my husband which of the men had called me back. He said he could not remember but I pressed him. Whereas nineteen years had elapsed and his memory had dimmed, my memory of Heaven’s meadow remains stark and fresh. Throughout the years, I had simply assumed it was he who had spoken. He was my husband, so it seemed natural that he would ask me to come back. But it was necessary for writing my book.

  'Was it you?' I prodded. 

  'I really can’t remember all the details,' he repeated.

  I begged. 'Try to remember. You must remember. I have to know who spoke, so I can put it in the book.' 

  The line was silent before he replied. 'I was praying and the doctor was doing the medical procedures.' His slow response was indicative of pondering as he traveled back in time in his mind. 'I don’t think we talked to you because you were out. We talked to each other, but not to you.' 

  Then he added, sounding suddenly sure. 'We did not talk to you.'

  Who then had spoken to me? 

  The hairs on my entire body rose. 

  I know who spoke! 

  And if He told me to 'come back' it means He was present in the place I was coming back to. 

  Could that be the reason I have had so many supernatural experiences since? Did God plan all along to partner with me and show me things for a greater cause?

  I let my body sag on the loveseat. Until that day, I had lived in a state of relative oblivion to the implications of being in Heaven and hearing God speak directly to me in Eternity. Hearing Him there is different than the Holy Spirit speaking to me on earth. I heard the voice that said 'Let there be' and stars fixed themselves in the galaxy. Waters flooded the oceans, and the animals appeared. Though the tone of the injunction given to me to come back was soft, I had the impression it echoed throughout Eternity. 

  As I pondered this in August 2017, I felt the Holy Spirit impressing on me: You have been in the Shadow of the Almighty. You have been in the Secret Place. You have been with the Prince of Peace. Peace surrounded you. He filled you inside and it settled within you. You are a Carrier of Peace. Go now and carry Peace.

  I had buried the responsibilities entrusted through visits, visions, and encounters with angels. I had been schooled by God Himself and I had remained silent. 

  'I’ll be silent no more, Lord,' I vowed. I meant it, and He knew I meant it too. 

  I had already begun to proclaim my supernatural realities publicly on social media. In 2018 I began to host a show entitled ETERNITY on cable television, and in 2019 I released my book TOUCHED BY ETERNITY: A TRUE STORY OF HEAVEN, HEALING AND ANGELS. 

  I had been told that I was having  a boy child. Upon birth the baby was a girl. She was showered with countless gifts from friends and family, including a little pastel-green dress with short puffed sleeves and a white collar embroidered with the same green. That day in Heaven on October 16, 1998, a dozen little ones had been playing under the tree and moving in a circle. A little girl in a pastel-green dress had stumbled and fallen, and was picked up and re-established in the game. I was fascinated by her, more acutely interested in her than the rest. I had felt as if I knew this child, that we had a connection. 

  I had been framing photos when suddenly a holy awe ran up my body and chills swept over me. As if someone had brushed cobwebs from my face, I knew who the child was. The little girl was my child, the one I carried in my womb when I collapsed in the OB/GYN’s office. The dress the little girl in Heaven had been wearing is the same design and color as the gift my daughter received and was wearing in the photo I was framing! 

  God had allowed me to see her as He saw her. Her 'falling down' was symbolic of the precarious position she was in, given my condition. But she did not remain fallen. Her being 'picked up' was symbolic of restoration and healing.

  Father God took me Home and showed me how this infant child, whose life depended on mine, would make it. I would become well and we would live. 

  Unborn children are in Heaven. I saw my child and others, and my personal future in Heaven. I believe that we all are in Heaven before we are sent to this earth to parents but we make a choice whether we will go back to spend Eternity with God. I’ve dedicated my life to leading as many to God by asking 'Where will you spend Eternity?'

  Thank you for reading my story.

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Childbirth     Heart ablation and pinched nerve  Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   Yes, I've had three experiences. I was sick with hyperemesis gravidarum in 1998; I was hospitalized for a pinched nerve in 2017; I had dental surgery that led to the third NDE in 2017.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      No    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   When I found myself walking in Heaven’s meadow in 1998; when I tunneled up and stood large and transparent in 12015; when my life gushed out as water and a bright light approached me in 2017. I knew everything I wanted to know at the time I needed the knowledge. I could see far. I was telepathic.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         During my second NDE in 2015. I was acutely aware of being on the edge of Eternity and seeing the land afar that Isaiah refers to in the Bible. I felt like I was a tourist in Eternity, a journalist who recording is burned in memory. It was super quiet. I was a large transparent silhouette with no organs. I knew things before I could ask questions. I was as alert and knowledgeable as I have been to date.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Time seemed to stand still, as if there was need for time. It was timeless. I felt I was in the other world for a longer time than the clock on earth suggested.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I was sick before the experience so my vision was dimmed and blurry. During my NDEs I could see clear and far. I had perfect vision.    

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      My hearing was normal, but the voice that told me 'You must come back' was soft but authoritative, as if it echoed in Eternity.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     In my second NDE of 2015. The tunnel was about 4-5 feet wide, and it was made of clear glass or crystal. It was cool and dim in the tunnel.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         Yes     the face of deceased Steve Jobs of Apple Inc appeared before me in my 2017 NDE. (Jobs has no relation to me, but I own an iPhone and a MacBook Pro.) In the first one of 1998, I saw my unborn child playing with a group of other children. This has a long and complex explanation. I was aware of a big, tall Someone (God?) walking with me in the meadow but I did not see His face. I was aware of an angel bringing me back in 1998, and one on the outside of the tunnel as I whooshed up in 2015. I was aware that the light that approached me in 2017 was Jesus.  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   In my third NDE of 2017  saw a bright orange light in a circle coming towards me. The orange lightened to an amber color of the most beautiful gold. It is soft, the color of champagne. Then there is no orange, only a circle with deeper gold on the perimeter, radiating in umbra style to the color of champagne, then becoming white at the core. This exquisiteness defies imagination. The deeper gold on the circumference is likewise indescribable, not like the yellow-gold we see on earth. The light is more stunning than anything I have ever seen, brighter than the sun, yet it does not hurt or dazzle my eyes and I do not squint.  As I watched the light come towards me, I thought of Jesus’ words, 'I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life.' (John 8:12 NLT).    

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     Definitely yes. I was in a meadow in Heaven in 1998; When the tunnel stopped in my 2015 experience, I was on the edge of Eternity. It was boundless, and communication was telepathic. I knew where I was and I had answers to questions before I could ask them. I saw castles in 2015 and 2017 NDEs, and the one in 2015 had manicured gardens. The colours, the grounds, landscapes and castles are beyond description, their beauty incomparable.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Peace, calm, Happiness, relaxed, rested. Like this is where I belonged and I had come home.  There was nothing negative. I didn’t want to come back. In my second NDE it was one of wonder, curiosity, as if I was a journalist recording details to be reported.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     Yes. It was as if I was allowed to share in God’s all-knowingness while on His territory.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         Scenes from my personal future     Yes, a scene with a little girl in a green dress. I was told I was having a boy. When the child was born in 1999  she was a girl…someone gifted her a green dress, and years later, I would make the connection that it was the dress I had seen her at play in Heaven Meadow’s in 1998.  

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will  I was sent back against my will. During my first NDE of 1998 - I was in Heaven's meadow. There has been no verbal communication in the meadow, no human voice, but without warning I become aware that I am talking.   'I don’t want to go back,' I protest aloud. 'I want to stay here.' This unbelievable peacefulness my ninety-five-pound body ached for and finally found is mine, and no one is going to take it away.  'I don’t want to go back,' I beg again. But it is too late.   'YOU MUST COME BACK.' The voice is soft, but there is a finality I cannot argue with. There is complete authority in the words. I have no choice.   Faster than any speed I could imagine, I found myself receding from Heaven, sucked back to somewhere.' (excerpt from Touched By Eternity: A True Story of Heaven, Healing, and Angels)  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant   I was Charismatic Pentecostal  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I seek God more. I spend more time exploring my spiritual encounters, and I am contented with solitude and soulful thinking. I started the television show as part of the convictions that have led me to share and normalize conversations of NDE and the afterlife.  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant   Charismatic Pentecostal but more open to other faiths and spiritual experiences.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I had not given credence to NDEs before these experiences happened to me. I now believe a lot more of what others have shared about the life to come even if I did not read such in the Bible. Not everything is written in Scripture but many things are alluded to and some things we will only know when we get there. I had a vision where I was taken down to Hell and it lines up with what the Bible says.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I believe the aspects of Eternity that other NDErs have seen and described. God appears to people of all beliefs and religions.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   A voice said 'You must come back.'  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   In my third NDE of 2017  I saw a bright orange light in a circle coming towards me. The orange lightened to an amber color of the most beautiful gold. It is soft, the color of champagne. Then there is no orange, only a circle with deeper gold on the perimeter, radiating in umbra style to the color of champagne, then becoming white at the core. This exquisiteness defies imagination. The deeper gold on the circumference is likewise indescribable, not like the yellow-gold we see on earth. The light is more stunning than anything I have ever seen, brighter than the sun, yet it does not hurt or dazzle my eyes and I do not squint.  As I watched the light come towards me, I thought of Jesus’ words, 'I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life.' (John 8:12 NLT). Jesus was there to lead me to eternal life as I departed earth. He was moving towards me as I exhaled earth and inhaled Eternity. In Revelation 21:23, John describes this light. 'And the city has no need of sun or moon, for the glory of God illuminates the city, and the Lamb is its light' (NIV).   In spite of my dazed, pain-filled state, I knew one thing with absolute certainty. I had seen Jesus, the light of the world.     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     My baby was in my tummy when I had my first NDE. I saw her playing with other children in Heaven's meadow while I watched them. She had not yet been born.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     It exists.During my second NDE of 2015 - I aware of being taller than my 5 feet 2 inches, and I am not human flesh. Instead I am a large human silhouette that is transparent. I can see my body in space and I have no organs, only a distinct, clear form. My mind and brain have grown proportionate to the vastness I gaze upon, and the vastness and I blend in one. (excerpt from Touched By Eternity: A True Story of Heaven, Healing, and Angels)  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     Yes, that God exists. In 1998 God walked with me and I was in His shadow as stated in Psalm 91:1 in the Bible. He told me to come back even though I wanted to stay. Jesus approached me as I was dying in 2017.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   I felt as if I possessed the same knowledge as God as He permitted, but that some details may be obscured when I returned to earth, and some will unfold over the years to come.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I received two miraculous healings during my first NDE while I was in Heaven. Peace filled me. I felt I had to carry peace and healing to others, to show compassion, and to point all to Jesus.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     There is life after death as the Bible describes. There are mansions in Heaven. Unborn children are in Heaven. Everyone is at peace in this most exquisite place.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Uncertain     Using whatever resources/advantages we are entrusted wisely and with the focus of leading people to the Lord.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     Particularly I was aware how compassionate God is. He knows our weaknesses, our foibles. He remembers that we are weak and broken, that we are dust.   And the ability to live compassionately lies in the remembering. We must remember the weaknesses of others, and deal with them gently, patiently, mercifully, because each of us will have a moment when we need another to overlook the wrong, and forgive. My empathy has increased with my NDEs. I welcome diverse views, eager to discuss so I can point another to Christ. I am more open-minded than I used to be.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     In my third NDE when Jesus approached me He was full of love.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     My religious/spiritual was always of paramount importance. I am trained in Biblical Theology and have been preaching the gospel for three decades now (my husband was a pastor and I was heavily involved in ministry hence the reason I chose Minister as my background. I am a teacher by profession and have worked in healthcare for several years.) However, since my third NDE I have been laser focused on normalizing the conversation of the afterlife, and I share this on social media and television. I wrote a book, and speak about my miraculous healings at groups and churches and on television. I am prepared to travel the world to share about escaping Hell and making it to Heaven. People have told me that they feel incredible peace and joy when they hold my book, listen to me speak, or some by simply being in my presence. I believe that the peace, healing and joy I experienced in Heaven's meadow are transferred to others, and for this I give God praise.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes Some have seen me as a trail blazer in this subject.  Many have shared their experiences with me but have not shared them publicly as they are afraid of being ridiculed.  Some of the ones who shared with me have distanced themselves on social media perhaps because they do not want others to know that THEY had had those experiences (which they told me).  Some have distanced themselves because they do not believe.  Some church leaders do not know how to handle the subject of NDE and feel threatened to bring in the subject because they are not the 'expert'.   Many have believed, and confided their experiences, reviewed my book, invited me to share my testimony, and support me publicly on social media and otherwise. Praise God.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The colors were indescribable. The beauty was incomparable to any building or palace on earth that I’ve seen. The peace had to be experienced rather than described. Vocabulary yet has to be created to describe the life to come.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The supernatural experiences remain stark and vivid throughout the years. My encounters with angels (which are in my book) are also concise. I cannot remember ordinary life events with such clarity.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes      I am more aware of the life to come. I see spirit beings - angels and demons, which probably started around 2014/15. I also have a heightened sense of the spirit world in general, be that heaven or hell or the 'environs' there. I am very interested in the sky and celestial spheres. Since my 20s I’ve operated in gifts of the Holy Spirit but they are more honed in now. I saw angels at my closet door in my bedroom in June 2019 and thought of Michael the archangel. When I went to my closet my Michael Kors dust bag was dislodged- a sign. I took a photo of it and often show it when I go to speak.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Seeing my daughter in heaven before she was born, and how cares for the unborn. As well, what I saw lines up with Scripture, and this makes the Bible more credible to me (NDE #2). The vision of Hell was a horror I never want anyone to inherit as their eternity.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    The first NDE occurred in 1998  I shared it briefly in 2004 - there was no response  In detail to my sisters in 2010 - they were silent the changed the subject abruptly  In 2017 two weeks after my third NDE on social - Wow. The response was overwhelming. People believed. Over 100 individuals have told me confidentially of similar experience they've had but are afraid to speak for fear f being ridiculed or termed 'mentally ill'. I've become a safe zone for many. I belong to several groups on social media that focuses on NDEs and I've been able to contribute well.  2018- Speaking at churches and on television  2019 - Speaking, and my book is published. It has been well received.  2020 - Ongoing, and now on NDERF site.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real     I knew what had happened was real but I had not yet realized that I was healed of hyperemesis gravidarum or of a heart murmur. (I have the proof now, and received medical records of the heart murmur healing in 2017.)  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I've had three NDEs and medical records to prove my healings. One NDE may be able to dismiss, but after three I'm reaching the 'master's level'. No one can convince me that what happened to me did not happen. FOR THIS IS REAL. Also, I was a private individual. I could not fathom talking of my illnesses, but I felt that if I did not share/write about them, I might keep on having more NDEs, sickness and pain. I felt God had a plan for me to talk about them and normalize these aspects of the supernatural.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   In 1995 an angel visited me when I was home alone and scared. In 2004 while reading a book and praying for the presence of God. I felt a warmth steal over my body and the most incredible sense of peace – a resemblance of the peace as I had experienced in Heaven.  In 2011 an angel rescued my husband and I from danger while in Las Vegas  In 2018 I was at home alone and very scared, and when I woke up there were 5 angels next to my bed, and two more near the door.   Very frequently I see evil spirits upon waking up or removing the cover from over my eyes.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I am driven to talk of my experiences. If you would like to partner with my book or testimony, I am very open to this. You all are medical doctors and I have medical records to prove my healings. I have not given my NDEs of 2015 and 2017 in detail but I can if you are interested.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         This questionnaire took me about 12 hours to compile (rather than the 45 minutes suggested) so letting respondents know that there are 64 questions which could span 45 minutes - 12 hours depending on whether they choose the Yes/Uncertain options would be helpful. Also, despite hitting the Submit button many times, the form did not go through. Note- I emailed Jody and she replied with instructions as to filling ALL the required fields. (Thanks Jody). Perhaps adding instructions to fill in ALL fields would be helpful.
