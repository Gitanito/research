 The prospectus for the journal says that "its dominant spirit is 'Investigation.'  To be sure, it calls special attention to the Bahai Revelation, because from a profound study of that Revelation it believes it to be worthy of a broader field of discussion and investigation than it has had heretofore.  Reality also believes in this Revelation as embodying all forms of modern and ancient thought, with a special significance at this time."  The Bahai religion had an enormous attraction for those drawn to New Thought, occultism, Theosophy, and eastern religions in the first quarter of the twentieth century because of its generally non-specific beliefs and association with actual, historical oriental sages.  Contributions by Eugene del Mar, Arthur J. Reeder, Mary Hanford Ford (an exponent of man’s primordial bi-sexuality), and others, and extensive advertisements for the whole spectrum of contemporary mages, healers, clairvoyants, mediums, peddlers of success, astrologers, etc.  ("The Miracle Man of Chicago," "Christ-Way College of Occult Science, Incorporated," "The Aquarian Ministry," "School of the Chemistry of Life," "Prof. C.
