  		              		Experience Description   

    A 500 lb. beam crashed down on me. I was hit  on the head and back, causing me to fall  under the beam. I remember on first impact thinking, 'This is it.'
  
  As I was falling down from being hit with the beam, it all was happening in slow motion and seemed like it took me forever to hit the ground.
  
  All at once, I was somewhere else and felt great. I started seeing all the events in my life as they went past my field of vision.   I had forgotten most of these events. 
  
  I suddenly seemed to know all the questions in my life and had all the answers. I just knew all the mysteries of life. I remember thinking about why I didn't  know this before. 
  
  Then, I could see all of my deceased family members standing in a semi-circle waving to me and welcoming me. But, they were beyond a point where I could go to  them.
  
  I then realized that it was not time for me to stay here.  

  I was back in my body and on my stomach with huge weight lying on my neck. 

  My experience was wonderful in that, from that point, I have never again feared death. I felt like that was really home when I was there.
