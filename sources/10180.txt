I was being worked up for symptoms of light headedness.  This test had you strapped to a 'stretcher'. The first part was lying flat with electrodes monitoring the heart.  Blood pressures were taken a minute apart for 3 minutes.  Then the stretcher was raised vertically and pressures were monitored every 5 minutes.  At the seven minute mark, I started feeling very strange and said I was going to pass out.  As blackness engulfed me, I heard the staff say 'she's going out'.  The next thing I remember is that I was in this wonderful meadow with brilliant light, warmth and such beautiful flowers.  I had such a sense of happiness and love.  I saw forms but not faces.  The next thing I remember was waking up, having a hard time breathing, and feeling sick to my stomach.  I later found out that between the time it took for them to lower the stretcher flat, my heart has stopped twice.  Ever since then, I haven't been afraid of death.
