lamb is watching the testimony from the
National Press Club there was there were
witnesses that mentioned seeing objects
on radar moving very high speeds and the
right angles right which to me means
that they must be be materialized if
they have any life forms on board
otherwise they would have been smoothed
by the momentum of the right ankle any
implications in terms of like the soul
that might be in the project is how can
be materialized and then come back well
he&#39;s asking a question about objects
that are moving like at a hundred
thousand miles an hour or 20 thousand
miles an hour make a right turn actually
they do not have to be dematerialized
what they do is that they can create if
you will a energy field around the craft
that is kind of like control for one
gravity and so even if you and it moves
with the object so this is field
propulsion all right so it can be moving
at 100,000 or 200,000 miles an hour and
stop or make a right hand turn now if
you were in a jet aircraft your brains
would be coming out of your nose
literally I mean it would kill you but
if you have the ability to control
what&#39;s called gravity control and mass
control and remember it it&#39;s a misnomer
to say anti-gravity it&#39;s actually if you
will a mass attenuation the reduction of
mass so using resin at certain resonant
frequencies no electromagnetically you
can cause an object to become lighter
and then completely massless now at the
point that it&#39;s massless it&#39;s out of
this dimension but it can be 99%
massless and you will see some aspect of
it you see what I&#39;m saying and this has
to do with spin theory in physics and
altering the angular momentum of the
atoms and subatomic protocols I&#39;m not
going to go into the Arcana of this
because people be bored but you know we
understand how this works but basically
the whole craft and everyone on it is
and around this object is a field that&#39;s
created so that&#39;s how it can move
and they can still be fully materialized
and move now it may also be that they&#39;re
not materialized and all your scene is
sort of a energy form or a plasma effect
such as when Estonia Campbell who was an
Air Force security officer at the Air
Force Base in Oklahoma back in the 60s
and there was a cobalt blue sort of
chevron or triangular craft it came over
the hot nuclear-armed aircraft that we
had there and he and the other security
guards could see it but it wasn&#39;t solid
it literally could go straight through
the aircraft and but it was enough in
this dimension that it set up all the
alarms so all the pilots had to go from
the hot into the hot area and take off
this is in the disclosure book and in
the material so but in that case they
were like what are we seeing it was
almost like a an apparition because what
they were doing they were checking out
our nuclear weapons but in a form that
wasn&#39;t fully solid and to understand
that you have to begin to understand how
you can sort of change mass to where it
crosses over into just energy pure
energy which all all mass really is pure
energy but that that&#39;s all that&#39;s left
and represented and then turn it tweak
it a little more and it&#39;s invisible it&#39;s
still there and all you may do is pick
up an electromagnetic signal which is
why learning how to make contact and how
the phenomenon comes it&#39;s really useful
to come on one of these expeditions that
I run know if it&#39;s just semi
transitional thing that we&#39;re seeing
like maybe that semi transdimensional
versus dematerialized
how do we know what which really is
what&#39;s happening when you see just that
glow but it may not be there we just see
like just see the light that&#39;s being
emitted from the object but maybe it&#39;s
not physical if he materialized or was
it like transit
between the matches do we know yes we do
now
he&#39;s asking how do you know if it&#39;s D
material lot if it&#39;s really completely
out of this dimension you&#39;re not going
to see it you may remove view it and
there may be an electromagnetic field
effect but visually you&#39;re not going to
see remember your eyes only see a very
limited spectrum if you are seeing it
and it may be only transiently they may
only be like a heat wave effect and you
see this thing shimmering and it comes
in and out of this dimension what it&#39;s
doing its phasing in and out and it can
at that point fully materialized in an
incident fully d materialized in an
incident and this is actually what Corso
described it wasn&#39;t in his book but I
mean I saw it in his papers when I went
to his house had a stack of papers this
big and Colonel Corso had this encounter
at white sands where this craft
materialized the broad daylight and then
it would D materialize and when it was D
materialized there was Sicily look like
a heat wave you know like a mirage in
the desert and then in the shape of the
ship and then it would go click and be
fully materialized back and it did this
back and forth showing him this is a
transition between dimensions as it does
that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying it&#39;s going from
3d and to other D ok but you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a radio waves
if you imagine you know you the old
tuners where you can turn and sometimes
you will hear two stations at once on
the old AM radio dials you know where
you turn they can sometimes be in
multiple dimensions simultaneously but
that you know this is a really advanced
discussion of the technologies but you
know yes we do understand how they do it
and classify programs have also
experimented with doing the same thing
yeah we have time for probably I have
what time do you guys have 6 5 5 58 we
have 2 minutes before we&#39;re supposed to
take a break is that right yeah so let&#39;s
see I&#39;ll take someone who hasn&#39;t asked a
question yet yes sir
nation if you would relate a story about
how you bet ET unity of kindness yeah
and at least yeah the day tonight sherry
adamak passed away that&#39;s when I was
introduced to the CTI call kindness yes
is it common to have encounters with
people who are passed away also when
you&#39;re having encounters with ETS I
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s common but it does
happen and remember if you go beyond the
speed of light what I call the crossing
point of light you go into energy fields
that begin to approximate what the
Mystics used to call the astral which is
closely approximated to if you will the
afterlife the asteroid aspect of your
body so the night that sherry adamak
passed away I had this awakened in this
lucid state and she was there
introducing me to this ET with a
perfectly round head I mean exactly
round not elongate at all and the Chi
and completely hairless and very very
kind I call her kindness because that&#39;s
she just admitted this kindness and oh
and almost every expedition under the
stars we&#39;ve had since 1998 she has shown
up and what looks like a sometimes it&#39;s
cobalt blue and sometimes it&#39;s diamond
blue white ship and often it&#39;ll come in
and make a curve and then go back out
and dematerialize but almost in its
that&#39;s distinctive it&#39;s very distinctive
so yes we have and she&#39;s my
understanding is that she&#39;s a very
senior diplomat with an interstellar
coalition very enlightened and it&#39;s sort
of like the Bijou when we had this
experience and Joshua tree the amount of
just the development of consciousness of
these life forms that have explored the
cosmos for thousands some of the
millions of years
it&#39;s just stunning and the intelligence
but so yeah that continues to happen and
it&#39;s very unusual that we&#39;re out for on
one of these week expeditions where we
don&#39;t see that ship yeah I mean I&#39;ll
have yes I&#39;ll have dreams with her yeah
yeah and by the way the lucid dream is
an amazing tool because it&#39;s you know
buried within everyone is everything the
entire you know it&#39;s like this old
saying from the Sufi I think a Sufi
tradition think it&#39;s thyself a puny form
when within the the universe is folded
in other words it&#39;s a rhetorical
question you&#39;re not just some little
thing through the structure of
consciousness in mind the entire cosmos
is folded within every single person
like a quantum conscious hologram so
we&#39;re all conscious quantum holograms
and the entirety of the cosmos and
creation is folded within every single
one of us so that&#39;s why you can have a
lucid dream or be in a meditative state
and see other worlds and see other
places or even other dimensions where
people have you know passed on and it&#39;s
it&#39;s quite beautiful now you know trying
to prove that scientifically but it&#39;s a
global experience I mean there&#39;s so many
people who&#39;ve had lucid dreams of
something that&#39;s happened the next day I
mean so there&#39;s empirical evidence but
you know you can&#39;t prove it but
ultimately I think in the future we will
have the ability technologically to
prove these things and until then we can
use you know what God gave us our own
consciousness and fault in mind and
create a new world
well I with that I think it&#39;s a great
place to end it&#39;s a little after 6:00 I
want to thank all of you for coming
we&#39;ll have time to hang here for a
little while and I just want to say in
closing really the key thing to
disclosure into contact is people
stepping into their own power and not
waiting for other people to do it
because if you wait for others to
do it it will never happen this is
something that has to be a grassroots
mass consciousness event and the next
phase of disclosure is going to be
exactly that and the more that people
understand that and actually do it
instead of just thinking about it the
more rapidly we&#39;re gonna get to this
next level of our civilization the
future of which is beautiful if we get
it right because it&#39;s a future of free
energy abundance and unbelievable
prosperity on this planet peace
Universal peace and interstellar travel
that is what we&#39;re right at the point of
being able to create that reality and
that is the the future for Earth and
humanity if we choose to make it that
but it isn&#39;t going to happen by people
sitting and doing nothing it&#39;s going to
happen because you actually you know
kind of walk that talk and make it
happen and so empowerment of yourself
and learning to do this and also helping
us identify the people who can be this
next wave of disclosure witnesses you
know just by sharing the disclosure book
and and the videos of what we&#39;ve already
put together with people people will
come up to you and say oh well I know
someone who was in the Navy who was on a
ship that had this hour someone who&#39;s
worked for Lockheed Martin at the cube
and Edwards we need to get a whole new
wave of people to come forward that will
just end forever the question of the
secrecy but that&#39;s only the beginning of
the work because the real work is is
then after that where we have to find a
way of creating a world on this planet
that is worthy of becoming part of an
interstellar family of planets which
means a peaceful civilization
