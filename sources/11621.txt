  		              		Experience Description   

    I had been drinking rum all day with my new husband.  I drank too much and  ended up on the floor of my garage.  I believe I stopped breathing.

  All of a sudden, I was very far away and in a tunnel that was swirling Darkness.  Yet, it felt just as it was fit for me. I was not scared.  I saw a bright light, way far away.  I turned around and saw myself lying on the floor. My husband was crying and yelling my name over and over again.  I seemed to be really far away from my body.  I wasn't floating upward or anything, I was just in one place in  tunnel.  It lasted a few minutes.

    Next thing I know, I'm back in my body.  I want to go back to where I was.
