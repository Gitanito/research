I was stung hundreds of times by hornets. My last conscious recollection was my friend carrying me into the hospital. 

Then I suddenly was above myself looking on.  I stuck with my body as they wheeled me into the emergency room.  Then I was in the corner of the room looking down at my body as they worked on it. It was like floating and seeing all. I recall no pain just an interest in what was going on with my body. An injection was given to my body.

Suddenly, I was back in my body, feeling terrible and throwing up. I never thought twice about it until later in years as I started hearing about these happenings; I realized I, too, had experienced this.
