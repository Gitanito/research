  Description of Deceased Beings:     Narrative response to NDERF survey question “Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?”


    This page contains over 170 near-death experiences (NDEs) that describe encountering deceased beings, excluding religious figures.  This is a sampling, and not intended to be a comprehensive listing of all deceased beings in NDEs posted on NDERF.

      Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a collection of NDEs describing encounters with deceased (or living) beings available to the world with as compressive a collection of such NDEs as possible. We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDEs describing encounters with deceased (or living) beings.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  We strive for accuracy in this list. If any NDEs should not be included for any reason, please email us at nderf@nderf.org with the NDE registry number and URL. Thanks!

    This is a compilation of responses to the NDERF survey question regarding encountering deceased beings stated above. The ‘Description of Deceased Beings’ column below is the data from the NDERF survey without changing any spelling or grammar errors. Even a quick review of the NDEs below should demonstrate that encountering deceased beings who previously lived an earthly life is common.

My uncle Sidney and aunt Eleanor were there, two other memorable people in my childhood, as well as an old rancher from the range across the river who had given me work as a boy. These people all had all passed on before me.However, at one point, as I was being shown how to manifest things, and how anything I wanted would be instantly granted, I thought of a piece of my mother's chocolate cake. Instantly she was there with me in heaven handing me a piece of her, heavenly chocolate cake. I knew she was alive on earth, and assumed she might be dreaming that she was baking a cake for me.
