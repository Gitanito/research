how do you keep some secret you hide it
in plain sight July 8 1947 the flying
this has been found and there&#39;s now in
the possession of the army if you look
at the document sent to Jo Hoover three
so-called flying saucers had been
recovered in New Mexico it&#39;s become the
number one document viewed on the FBI
website there have been 18 visitation
and people have been attempting to
conceal this knowledge we actually did
recoveries the bodies that were involved
with some of these crashes first of all
you&#39;re going to tell the public about it
and they says no we don&#39;t tell the
public about this there begin to be this
bifurcation that this separation between
legitimate national security and
military operation and the deep black
programs that are unacknowledged
if people think that it&#39;s just the UFO
issue are gravely mistaken this is one
of the ultimate secrets that needs to be
exposed if there was a project that was
illegal the president doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s
occurring who&#39;s going to stop this from
happening
the moon of Mars there&#39;s a very unusual
structure when people find out about
that they&#39;re going to say who put that
there
these deeper black programs have the
technology the hoax and the alien
invasion they could do it and they could
do it in a way that&#39;s a hundred percent
believable it&#39;s very easy to set up a
false flag operation concoct all kinds
of false information they have people
embedded in all the major media to
change and affect stories if you tell
anyone about this project this bullet
has your name on it
and it will find you the strategy was
the first eruption for the enemies and
terrorists would be identified then
third world countries crazes the last
card is the alien part and all of it is
a lot
