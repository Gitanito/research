I was alone in my room and suddenly there was the appearance of a figure in bright light at the foot of my bed. It was so bright it awakened me. The figure approached the side of my bed and took my hand; he then said 'It will be alright.'

After that, I next remember being awakened in the catheter laboratory after the procedure was over and, indeed, it was all right. I never feared anything in this and I never feared it afterward. Since then, I have had five stents implanted and an Implanted Cardio Defibrillator (ICD) placed in my chest. But I have never felt any fear at all. I know that whatever may come there is more than this earthly life.
