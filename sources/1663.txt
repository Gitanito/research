 John Calvin Spurlock, Free Love:  Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America, 1825-1860 (UMI, 1987), 389, says that this was the organ of a Cincinnati brotherhood and was proto-spiritualist.  This last seems to have been expressed only in the journal's reviews of the claims of J.R. Buchanan and La Roy Sunderland, and in interminable discourses on "Spiritual Philosophy" and Mesmerism and its phenomena.  Hine ( -1909) was a labor radical and a center for radicalism of all sorts in the Ohio Valley.  Articles on "Pathetism."
