verity of all parts of Astronomical Literature ; and
being convinced that you are always disposed to give
judgment without partiality, I have here presumed to
lay before you the Geniture of this Despot, with the
Calculation thereof
In the course of this Work you iviU find I have
offered a variety f considerations on a Tract lately

in displaying those imperfections which have either
escaped the Author s notice

time between the Celestial Figure of Firth I have here
inserted, and that computed by the Author, is very
considerable, as any one may observe by comparing
them with each other; and therfore how the Author
obtained a knowledge of the time f Bonaparte’s birth
I know not, and presume it would be in vain to ask
a question fthat nature. In fine, it will doubtless be
acknowledged by every one, that Bonaparte certainly
is the most competent judge in ascertaining the estimate

to many, that the Astronomerforetold his rise to Imperial
Dignity, nearly five years bfore it happened, which
proves the imperfection f the Figure calculated by the
Author above alluded, to.— Therefore Ido not require

the Vulgar and Illiterate to busy themselves with a

LEARNED AND IMPARTIAL READER.

Some time ago I intended to have published the Genitur'e
of this Person, combined with a Work relative to this department of
Astronomy ; but finding it was not in my power to finish my Manu-
scripts in due time for the press, owing to the ill state of my health
at intervals, I have thus attempted to publish the whole Calculation at
large, hoping it will give satisfaction and pleasure to all those learned
and scientific Readers who are candidly disposed to bury Partiality and
Envy in Oblivion. For it is manifestly apparent, that nothing can be
more absurd among Men of Literature, than to conclude, before a
proper understanding be obtained, respecting the matter in question*
and controversy : —So is there nothing more worthy and laudable in a
person, than to be patient, and hear all true and possible information*
before he delivers his opinion on any subject, let the matter be what-
ever it may. So likewise on astral speculation it would doubtless
be very gross and inconsistent with reason and truth, to deride and eonA

demn the study thereof, as many do, because they know nothing of the
I
science, and its principles, hut the name only for it must appear evident
* /
to every rational man, that none but those who understand a science,
can possibly be admitted as competent judges thereof.
There are some persons that are critically envious, and cannot allow
of any thing that is not their own production, and beareth not the test
of their approbation ;
such envious and malicious persons as these (if I
may be admitted thus to stile them) very frequently use their utmost
luctations in order to stigmatize the labors of others, how good or
beneficial soever they be, because they cast as it were a veil over their
fame, and tend not to illuminate their reputation : these being inclined to
morosity, cannot look kindly at any thing of another’s, without frowning
and censuring. But suppose I ask such persons, by way of apology,
whether they are able to go through the whole immediate Calculation
of a Solar Eclipse, (which I well know that not one in an hundred are
able to perform, although they may be otherwise liberally learned) ; then
if such elaborate Calculations as Eclipses are found to be, require so
much study and application, what shall we say of obtaining a knowledge
of other abstruse sciences, which in themselves are much more difficult
and mysterious to comprehend.
It is a matter of no consequence what some persons may be subject
to depose in opposition to this department of Astronomy, called by some
Elementary Philosophy" in its pure and refined state, for the unerring
Word of God beareth witness against them, as well as reason and
experience: Moses tells us, “ the stars are for signs and seasons;”
Gen. Ut chap. 1 ith verse; which will doubtless be fulfilled in the fol-
lowing words :
“ And God made two great lights, the one to rule the
To the learned and impartial Reader 11
day and the other to rule the night.” Gen. c. 1. v. 16. To which I
answer, by way of quere—to what end, then, are these irresistible and
innumerable hosts of heaven ? Were they made for no other use than
to gaze on only ? The sun and moon sufficiently serve us for light,
(as a very learned and judicious writer observes), if we look no further
into their uses ;
but the Holy Scriptures further put this subject quite
out of doubt, if we will believe God’s Word, as it is written in the
28 th chap, of Job, 31 st v. For the Almighty, in that place, speaking
of his Omnipotent Power, asketh his servant Job, whether he can restrain
the sweet influence of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion. On
which words St. Augustine- referreth all men to the study of this de-
partment of Astronomy, the voice or language of the stars, for the
proper understanding of that place ;
and not only so, but shews us
that under these two constellations, the Lord doth comprehend the
influence of all the celestial host.
But if the unbelievers will not give credit to Augustine, Moses, nor
the Almighty himself, except they see arid feel, not to insist long on the
point, which is cleared by such prevalent and invincible witnesses, one
whereof will be deemed sufficient testimony against all the envious unbe-
lievers of this sacred learning ; for if what has been advanced now, be
insufficient for the clearing hereof, I would instance the great power of
the moon over the waters of the boundless ocean. But to manifest this
subject yet farther, (besides the influence of the moon, which is the cause
of the ebbing and flowing of the sea, and which of course is admitted
/
as authentic in general), let us but contemplate the mutation, and vari-
ation of times, and innumerable other effects of the heavenly bodies, which
I might here record, if time and opportunity would admit thereof; for,
12 To the learned and impartial Reader.
by the positions of the Stars and Planets, and their Configurations one
with another, (regard being had to the parts of heaven in which they
are, and the nature of the signs in which they are posited), we are enabled
to predict, with the greatest accuracy, the general accidents of Countries,
Kingdoms, Provinces, and Cities,—the cause of Plenty, Dearth, War,
and Peace,—Health, Sickness, and alteration of the Air, —Thunder, and
Lightning,—and all things appertaining to the Life of Man, naturally ;
wherein is the wisdom of the great God seen manifestly displayed in
the government of the world, by the constant and unerring harmony of
the Celestial Bodies.
Now if we read, and pay attention to what the learned Gerson has
advanced respecting the legality of this sublime study, we shall find
that he acknowledgeth it to be the nearest to divinity ; being, says he,
revealed to Adam, the first patriarch, by the Almighty, and so to his
posterity ;
most lawful, and to be desired, above all sciences in the
world, not being illegal or opposite to confidence in God, but indeed
rather a great means to acquaint us with his heavenly and incompre-
hensible divine self, when by the motions and influences of the celestial
bodies, we know the corruption,
generation,
and procreation of all things
in this elementary world ; and so contemplate and converse daily and
hourly with him who is not to be beheld by frail mortal eyes, or flesh,
nor to stand in the immediate presence of that Omnipotent God, whose
voice alone is a consuming fire. Wherefore there is nothing more cer-
tain than that God hath, in his secret wisdom, so disposed of the con-
stitution of the celestial bodies, that his will, by their operations and
several influences, is acted and performed thereby; so that to the end
of the world it is decreed by him to be so performed, and accomplished
by
To the learned and impartial Reader. 13
by them, according to the opinion and judgment of the learned P. dr
Ariaco, who, in his Concordance of this Science with Divinity,
proveth the Flood, Sects, Schisms, and other most notable accidents to
be signified in heaven long before ;
and this is also confirmed by Gerson,
who acknowledged heaven to be (as indeed it is) the instrument of
the Almighty, whereby he governeth this corruptible and inferior elemen-
tary world ;
this very learned author informs us, by his judgment, com-
bined with the Holy Scriptures, that God, foreknowing the chances of
men, hath (according to his divine will) described certain agreeable tokens
in heaven, concurring with the course of the world, even to the day of
judgment : from which it is evident, that the heavens have received many
virtues of God, according to the positions of the heavenly bodies, and
their motions, though not comprehended by all men.
That the heavens have a strong influence on sublunary elementary
things, as touching Sterility and Fertility, War and Peace, Sickness and
Health, alteration of the Air, and the general Accidents that are inci-
dent to Countries, I presume there are none but those who are impious
will dare to deny, since the word of God sheweth us the truth thereof.
For, first, if we look into the 26th chapter of Leviticus, verse 19th, you
will there find the Almighty threatening his children with sterility, for
disobedience : he saith, I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as
brass, viz. The heavens shall not duly, by their influence, distil those
comfortable showers of fertility; they shall be hard as iron. And so
likewise, on the contrary, when of his infinite goodness and mercy he
promiseth plenty, he saith, 1 will hear the heavens, and the heavens shall
hear the earth,
and the earth shall hear the corn, and the icine, and the
oil, and they shall hear Jezreel. Hosea, 2nd chap. 2 1st, 22nd verses. So
that
D
14 To the learned and impartial Reader.
that hereby we may observe most plainly, that there is a certain depen-
dency of the earth on the heavens, and their influence. Jezreel, the
people of the Lord, when their ways shall please him, shall be heard by
the corn, wine, and oil, viz. all suflicient necessaries, they being com-
prehended under these words. So that we see clearly the power of the
Great God in the order and disposal of Nature, who is theffirst moving and
efficient cause,
to whom all causes are but subordinate; yet we see that,
next unto Himself, the Stars are secondary causes,—and from him im-
mediate causes of all our earthly enjoyments or afflictions ;
for I would
know what causeth that amongst corn, (as many have observed), the ground
being well tilled and manured by the husbandman, and clean corn sowed
therein, and very pure from other mixture of seeds,—what causeth, I say,
that yet, notwithstanding all this, there will several flowers of various
colours grow up amongst it ? Also, out of the same seed, we find darnel,
and variety of other weeds, as well as that of a smutty quality. In
fine, the blight or mildew in corn, so universally prevalent in the
years 1803 and 1804, ought, consequently, to engage the attention of
f * #
the students in this science, in an eminent degree.
Now if all I have mentioned be not brought to pass through and
by the influence of the heavens, it cannot, most certainly, be occasioned
by nothing whatever in the fabric of the world; which is very mani-
fest to our understanding, if we believe what is written in the 33rd chap,
of Deut., 14th verse, where the whole influence of the heavens, and the
increase of vegetatives, are attributed to the two great Lights of the
world.
Now after all this has been premised, is it not most ridiculous and absurd
to imagine, (as many do), that the feeble efforts of man are able to counteract
the
To the learned and impartial Reader. 15
the decree and will of the Almighty. Often have I observed many-
vain and unthinking persons argue respecting an infallible preventive for
the smut in wheat, presupposing that the defect is to 'be wholly extricated
by substituting mercury,
and other poisonous minerals, with the seed, to
have the desired effect. I have long been informed, by gentlemen of-
distinguished reputation and abilities, (on whose authenticity I can rely),
that such preparations, according to their experience, are by no means
to be considered as infallible. I well remember that there was much
public controversy concerning the subject in the year 17 78, when most of
the parties interested differed in their opinions so much in the business,
that nothing of importance could be collected from their ideas ;
neither
could any just information be obtained from the depositions, &c. of those
who considered themselves equal to investigate so curious and mysterious a
cause. At that time I was a pupil to the then Mr. Nathaniel Tingle,
of Helpringham, near Sleaford, Lincolnshire, who was a man of the strictest
veracity, and possessed a profound knowledge of Mathematical Literature ;
in fine, I always esteemed him as my sincerest friend, who was always
ready to confer on me every favor in his power, according to the pro-
gress of my studies ; let his name,
therefore, live to future ages, that the
public may observe the respect I had for a man, whose name I shall
ever esteem and revere, as long as I remain in the land of the living.
Now from what has been premised respecting the subject before mentioned,
I am willing to hear what writers have to say concerning the means
used for preventing the smut, &c. but shall never give credit to some
of their assertions concerning the subject. It is therefore much to be
regretted, that men should attempt to set, as it were, the power of the
Almighty at defiance, iii things that they are by no means able to give
pro-
1 6 To the learned and impartial Reader.
profound reasons for, nor yet to comprehend. It would therefore, ac-
cording to my humble opinion, be deemed more wise and prudent for such
persons to ascribe all power, and might, to the Almighty, the great
governor of the universe, who ruleth over all his works ;
and
conclude with solemnity and reverence, that “ one may plant, and another
may water,
hut it is God alone that giveth the increase''
1
Now as touching the Mundane part of this Science, it is to be
observed, that the Celestial Bodies are the Representatives of Kingdoms
and States. We shall find wonderful configurations, indicative of violence,
discord,
and contention,
in the Celestial Figure of the Sun’s entering the
sign Aries, in the year 1789. Now in that Figure we find Saturn,
Mars, Venus, and Mercury, all in conjunction in the ascendant in the
watery sign Pisces, and disposed of by Jupiter in Cancer, well dignified,
and in a trine aspect to all those planets in the ascendant, which are
the significators of those Kingdoms and States, posited in the watery
Trigon. From that figure, the revolution of the French Empire was
foreboded, with all its direful consequences ; consideration had to the
positions of the Celestial Bodies in subsequent and preceding ingresses,
8tc. We may likewise clearly observe the violent efficacy of the grand
conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, which was celebrated in the sign
Virgo, in the month of July, 1802. These conjunctions are the forerun-
ners of Wars, Mutations, and other accidents ; and particularly, as the
above was celebrated in the ascendant of Paris, in France, it most clearly
points out, that the troubles of that restless nation are not yet nearly
at an end ;
which is further indicated by the violent conjunction of Saturn
and Mars in the sign Libra, in August, 1805; and likewise in Scorpio,
in September, 1807, &c. The effects of these conjunctions will be great
and
To the learned and impartial Reader, 17
and eminent. It is therefore my wish, that particular attention may be
paid thereto, (as well as subsequent ones), as the effects will be sudden,
quick and violent, with long continuance afterwards. These conjunctions
seldom shew their effects till after the separation of their bodies. And
I am happy to add, that those Significators in the Heavens which are
the Representatives of Great-Britain, being so remarkably exalted,
and superior in strength and dignity to those of her Enemies’, certainly
foreshew, that England will, in the end, settle all those Tribulations,
Com-
motions,
and Bloodshed, which have so long existed in the world ; she
will also increase in RICHES, HONOR, DIGNITY, and FAME,
throughout the HABITABLE GLOBE,—UNITING ALL NATIONS,
by HER SUPERIOR SRENGTH and MEDIATION, in the Bond of
lasting PEACE and UNITY, at the Conclusion of this TRYING
CONFLICT.
I have been much larger here than I intended, but shall now leave
this part of the subject, and proceed to investigate the Positions, Con-
figurations, and important Directions, in the Nativity of Napoleon
Bonaparte, now- stiled Emperor of the French.
The estimate time of this man’s birth, was August 14th, 1769.
21 h. 45m. post meridian; or the 15th cf August, at a quarter of an
hour before ten o’clock in the forenoon : the latitude of the place of his
birth being 41° 40' north, and Q° east longitude of London. Now I
am of opinion, that the estimate time of his birth is not far from truth,
because the effects of those di rections, which have advanced him to his
present Power and Dignity, (if you please to call it such), seem naturally
to correspond therewith. Here I am also of opinion that there are some
Practitioners in this Science, that would make a considerable Alteration
in
1 To the learned and impartial Reader.
in the lime of this Man’s Birth; and as he was made General Consul
of the French at the age of thirty years and nearly about four months,
they consequently would alter the time of birth, so as to make the mid-
heaven to the body of the sun indicative of that effect ; indeed, the
direction of the midheaven to the body of the sun is proper for the
promotion of the highest dignity,
honour,
and grandeur,
that can possibly
be conferred on man in this life ;
and the arch of direction of the mid-
heaven to the body of the sun to correspond with the time of his
Consulship, must be about twenty-seven degrees forty minutes, and the
right ascension of the midheaven 117 degrees 24 minutes; —and to this,
the time of birth would be about nine minutes past ten o'clock in the
forenoon, differing from the estimate time 24 minutes : and though this
may sound very well in the ears of some, yet, according to my under-
standing, it appears to be an absurd and unreasonable mode of rectifi-
cation in this case ; I will therefore give you my reasons which induce me
to differ from making so great an alteration in the time of his birth as
that before-mentioned, which are as follow :
* *
%
I have said before, that the effects of the midheaven to the body of
'
the sun, are indicative of the highest promotion and grandeur that can
be conferred on man ;
but in this case you will find the reverse ;
for, by
this mode of rectification, when the midheaven was directed to the body
of the sun, the sun was then, by a converse motion, directed to the body
of Saturn, in the zodiac, and mundo,—and a little before, the sun wat
directed to the opposition of the moon in mundo, by converse direction,
and afterwards to her mundane parallels direct and converse, and also to
the parallels of Saturn in mundo, direct, and converse direction. Now
here we find a train of violent directions to the sun, about the same
time
To the learned and impartial Reader. 19
time and a little after the midheaven came to the body of the sun ; so
that if he had many good and benevolent directions operating at the same
period, the violent ones I have just mentioned, would have rendered their
effects entirely abortive. Besides, if we believe the doctrine of the learned
Ptolemy, the influence of those mundane parallels of Saturn, and the
moon, I have mentioned before, ought to have proved mortal ; but in-
stead of that being the case, we find he was possessed of the highest
reputation as a General. And now, by this mode of rectification, some
are weak enough to admit the direction of the midheaven to the Lyon's
Heart to be a direction proper for his being crowned Emperor of France,
which I shall consequently object to, and give you my reasons for so
doing : And first, then, as the figure now stands as before, the right
ascension of the midheaven, being 1 1 7 degrees 24 minutes, and the right
ascension of that fixed star, the Lyon's Heart, (by the tables of De La
Lande), is 148 d. 45 m. ; therefore the arch of direction, thus wrought,
will be 3 id. 21m., which gives, in time, thirty-four years and three months;
but he was crowned at the age of thirty-five years and nearly four months,
so this direction of the midheaven to the Lyon's Heart did not come up
at the time ;
though I acknowledge, some tables make the right ascen-
sion of the Lyon's Heart somewhat more than I have here mentioned
yet if I was to allow the effects of that direction to be great and emi-
nent, (which I do not), it could be of no service whatever in a case of
this nature ;
and an intelligent man, this way conversant, may easily
judge of the matter in question. Now can any person suppose the direc-
tion of that point to a little fixed star, able to give such admirable Dig-
nity and Honour as this man has obtained ? and I positively say it is
ignorance in the extreme to suppose it. For it is evident, we must find
out
20 To the learned and impartial Reader.
out some other great and eminent direction to indicate his being Crowned
Emperor, in particular; and in performing this, we must make a small
alteration in the time of his birth,—the estimate of which was, as you
have already heard, a quarter of an hour before ten o’clock in the fore-
noon of the 15 th of August, 1769.
I shall, therefore, by my method of rectification, make the time of
birth nearly fifty-two minutes past nine, which makes a difference of
no more than seven minutes between the given time and the rectified.
The right ascension of the midheaven, to the above rectified time, will be
1 12 degrees 59 minutes, which, subtracted from the right ascension of the
sun, leaves the arch of direction of the midheaven to the body of the sun,
32 degrees 5 minutes ;
which, turned into time, gives thirty-five years and
a little more than three months, at vfflich age he wT
as crowned, in Paris.
And I am of opinion, it was under the effects of this glorious and
eminent direction, and that of the sun to the trine of Jupiter in mundo,
by converse motion, that he was made Emperor of France.
But I think I hear some dissatisfied with what I have here mentioned
concerning my allowing the midheaven to the body of the sun, &c. to
be productive of his coronation : to this I answer, it is a direction pro-
per for such an occasion ; and at the time it comes up, being combined
with the mundane trine of Jupiter, the sun is free from affliction, which
he was not in the foregoing case, where some have allowed this same
direction, making an alteration in the time, (as I said before), to signify
his Consulship, which was erroneous ;
for the midheaven to the body of
the sun can never be productive of great Dignity and Preferment, when
the sun at the same time meets ivith violent and furious directions,
as I
have
To the learned and impartial Reader. 21
have said before. I am therefore fully convinced, that the midheaven
to the body of the sun was not in the least indicative of his being
made General Consul; so am I also of opinion, that it was not the
effects of the midheaven to the Lyon's Heart that elevated him to Im-
perial Dignity, as some have pretended. We may therefore observe, in
this case, that such arguments are vain and invalid, neither are they
of any importance whatever, relative to the subject in question.
We are informed, that when this man was about twenty-six years
of age, he was made General of the Armed Force of France,
and expe-
rienced the greatest success in battle, which no person need be amazed
at, when it is considered that he had two particular and eminent direc-
tions to the sun, operating nearly at that time, and they are these, viz.
the sun to the sextile of Jupiter in the zodiac, and he in the radix in
a mundane trine to the midheaven, and the sun also to the sextile of
Venus in mundo, by direct motion: every one will allow that the effects
of these two directions are as great, and as benevolent,
as can possibly
be, and are certainly sufficient to confer the greatest honor and pre-
ferment on the native, as v eil as unlimited success in all enterprizes
whatsoever; and indeed I' rely on the effects of these directions to be
indicative of his advancement in the army at that period. And I assure
you, I do not pay that attention to directions at the time of his being
made General Consul as som** do ;
for, at the age of twenty-six
years, he was a General of the Army,
and at the age of thirty years
and three months lie was but still ci General,
and a commander as before.
And I do firmly believe it was particularly from the effects of those two
last-mentioned directions that paved the road to his Imperial Dignity,
which I say he obtained from the effects of the midheaven to the body
e of
22 7o the learned and impartial Reader.
of the sun, and the sun to the mundane trine of Jupiter, converse
direction ; the Diadem was placed upon his head, in Paris, on the second
day of December, 1804, at fifty-eight minutes past their eleven o’clock
in the forenoon.
I humbly beg pardon if I have trespassed too long on the patience
of the reader, I shall therefore now proceed to investigate the positions
and configurations in the Nativity of this Despot, which is a violent
one.—-The directions wrought in the course of the calculation are made
by true and natural motion: and through the whole of this Tract I
have adhered to the rules and precepts in the Quadripartite of the
learned Claudius Ptolemy.
I have not extended the calculation further than is requisite on
the occasion, neither shall I trouble the reader with a multiplicity of
directions which come up when the native is deprived of existence.
—
Wherefore unto Him alone that ordereth and disposeth all things accord-
ing to his Divine Will—and that created the heavens, earth, and celestial
bodies—and that calleth them all by their names—and that maketh them
differ from each other in glory—and that giveth of his free will and
pleasure the knowledge of divine and natural things to the sons of
men—be ascribed all possible praise, glory, power, dominion, and thanks-
giving, both now and for evermore. Amen.

The foregoing directions, here inserted, are the principal ones in this
man’s nativity, and of course ought to be minutely investigated ; though
there might have been many more, but I presume those I have here
calcu-
of BONAPARTE. 63
calculated are consequently sufficient for the purpose intended ; for had
I extended the calculation much further, it would have increased the
magnitude of the work considerably, which is my wish to avoid in a
case of this nature.
I should not have troubled myself with this geniture, had not the
position and directions in a great measure corresponded with the native
and his actions ;
for it is certain, there are few nativities that are to be
depended on respecting the true and correct time of birth ;
therefore, all
false genitures, that cannot properly be corrected for want of accidents
sufficient for the purpose, ought not by any .means to be regarded ;
for,
whoever attempts to give judgment on a false and imperfect nativity,
will
certainly err in the whole of his calculations, and consequently all his
labours will prove invalid and of no effect in the end. These things, in
a general way, give advantage to the enemies of this department of
Astronomy, when they observe the least error in the practisers of it, and
the irrational and unfounded principles by which some are guided. How
absurd it must appear, that many are yet to be found, who prefer the
imperfect doctrine of Argol, Morinus, and others, to that of the learned
Ptolemy. The before-mentioned authors have set forth those divisions of
the heavens, and directions in particular, in a way entirely disagreeing and
wholly opposite to that motion, agreeably to Nature,- exhibited -by the great
Ptolemy, only, in his Quadripartite. For it must be evident to every
one, that directions of every denomination that are not made by true
and natural motion, cannot have any effect.
It is astonishing to me when I observe the weak and unfounded argu-
ments used by Argol, IMorinus, and others, respecting directions, and
their effects in dead men s nativities ,* how often have we observed those
authors
04 The NATIVITY
authors direct the ascendant for death, when both the luminaries were
properly qualified to take the power of Giver of Life ? For it is certain
that a numerous train of directions to the ascendant cannot destroy life if
the luminaries, &c. are properly stationed to exercise the hylegiacal power.
For in every nativity there is only one Apheta, as Ptolemy has taught
us, and that Apheta,
only, must be directed for death, without any regard
whatever to the lords of the fourth,
sixth, eighth, or tivelfth houses, which
has never been mentioned in the least by that immortal Master of the
Predictive Science. Therefore, whoever attempts to trust the lords of the
houses, &c. in predictions of consequence, will of course suffer himself to
be imposed on, and gain nothing but disrepute at the conclusion.
I have been credibly informed, that a certain Astronomer has deposed,
that,
“ nothing of evil importance can happen to Bonaparte, until the
Ascendant comes to the Square of the Sun in the Zodiac.” This is
ignorance in the extreme, for there is no such direction in nature, except
you are inclined to believe the absurd writings of Parker,
Gadbury, Coley
Lilly,
&c,9
as the angles of the figure can only be directed in mundo ;
therefore, when the midheaven was directed to the body of the sun, in
this nativity, the ascendant was directed to the mundane square of that
luminary ; and this direction is not an imaginary one, but is made by
that motion appointed by God and Nature, and is easily demonstrated.
But to talk of the ascendant to the square of the sun in the zodiac, is
nothing but downright deceit and absurdity, there being no such direction
in nature, and true motion, as you have already heard.
In the geniture of Bonaparte, under consideration, much might be
premised respecting the directions which shewed their effects at the time
©f his Consulship, and previous thereto. I have mentioned something
con-
of BONAPARTE.
65
concerning this matter in my Address to the Reader, and shall therefore say
somewhat more on the same subject in this place, because it is geneially
understood that some have laid great stress on the midheaven to the body
of the sun, to signify that event. He was a General of the Army long
before he was made Consul, and (as I have said in another place) when
he was selected Consul he was but still a General and a commander as
before, though somewhat higher in dignity ;
and therefore his being
appointed General Consul only tended to confirm him in the office of a
General, which he possessed before, for at that time he had not arrived
at the height of his dignity.
Objection. —Why do you not bring any directions to signify his Coiu
sulship, as at that period he was vested with greater power and dignity
than before ?
Answer.—I have told vou before, that the sun to the sextile of Venus
in mundo, and the sun to the sextile of Jupiter in the zodiac, are two
of the best directions in the figure, and are indicative to raise the native
to the greatest preferment ;
but here we find the effects of those two
benevolent directions begin to cease, and evil ones to the sun commence,
and produce disastrous events ; for at the time he went to Egypt, and was
there beaten, and forced to return home for refuge, leaving the remaining
portion of his army to be there sacrificed, he had the sun, the signifieator
of honor, dignity, and power, directed to the sesquiquadrate of the
moon in mundo, and the sun to the body of Saturn in the zodiac and
mundo, by converse motion ;
all which directions are indicative of the
dangers' and calamities he experienced at that period.
Here, then, we may observe, that at the time of his being made Consul
he had not any benevolent direction operating; but, on the contrary,
there
<35 The NATIVITY
there were those in action of an opposite nature and influence. And,
a few months after his return from Egypt, he commanded the battle of
Marengo, and here, as well as in Egypt, he was defeated, at Jirst, but,
through the conduct of Desaix, a victory was obtained at last, the honor
of which ivas not due to Bonaparte,
I am certain.
Much more might be advanced in this place, to exhibit the character
and disposition of this native ;
but as I intend to be as concise as the
nature of the subject under consideration will admit, I shall not trouble
the reader with investigations that are foreign to the business in question.
As to the position, every way considered, it is indicative of violent evils and
unusual calamities in the end: for here we find the ascendant afflicted
by the semiquartile of Mars and mundane squares of Saturn and the moon,
for the moon is of a malevolent nature in this figure, and consequently
endowed with deadly qualities. The sun is in conjunction with a violent
fixed star, though strongly dignified, and applying to the mundane parallel
of Venus ;
he is also in square to Jupiter, who has exaltation in the
midheaven, and beholds that important angle with an exact mundane trine
but though this is the case, yet the unfortunate position of Saturn in the
midheaven in his detriment, afflicting the moon by an opposition, who is
posited in the Imum Cell, and in her detriment also, presage, that the
native will be deprived of his honor and reputation, in a great measure,
when he does not expect it ;
for the position itself carries with it so
much of the nature of violence, that, every way considered, it forebodes
the tyrannical disposition of the native, and the numerous crimes he has
committed, which every one but moderately versed in this study will
readily observe and apprehend. And I appeal to any man, who under-
stands the genuine and profound principles of this science, whether the
oppo-
of BONAPARTE. 67
opposition of the moon and Saturn, from cardinal signs and angular stations,
do not properly point out what I have just mentioned respecting the
native’s despotic disposition and violent arbitrary mind ;
which is in some
measure augmented by the violent sesquiquadrate of Mars to the moon:
though the nativity, printed by Mr. Orgar, with Jupiter in the ascendant,
and the sun on the midheaven, does not represent Bonaparte as a murderer,
blit a good-natured creature,
full of honor,
&c. Now, concerning the soul,
that divine and external part of man, it can by no means be governed
or swayed by the power of the celestial bodies, (as an eminent writer
observes), any further than it is informed or misguided by the senses
for, without doubt, by how much the more brutish a man is, the more
depraved and vicious are his mind and thoughts, those preliminaries to the
soul ; by which medium it is always conversant with, and exalted to, those
glorious mansions above,—or confusedly hurried among those corruptions
of nature, which are not only a clog to the volatile soul, but an utter
fall of ruin and destruction, in which (it is to be feared) many have perished,
both bodv and soul.
J
The former part of this native’s life being unknown to those that are
conversant in history, we are by no means able to collect any authentic
information respecting the accidents of it, until the 25 th and 26th vears
of his age, when he was nominated General of the Armed' Force of
France; we are informed this occurrence took place on the 4th day of
October, 1 7 Q 5 - s°me say he filled that elevated station With fidelity having
great success in battle ;
I believe the latter to be true, as to his success in
obtaining victories,—but as to the former, respecting his fdclity ,
it is
absurd beyond all question to conceive such an idea ;
as his figure of birth
will convince any one who observes it, that it represents most clearlv the
image
OS The NATIrIT Y
image of a murdering Despot ! I might, in this place, give a judgment
of the twelve Celestial Houses, in rotation, but as a consideration of that
nature would very much augment the size of the work, I shall of course
decline it, and particularly as it would not be interesting to the public
I shall therefore only notice what I conceive to be of more importance
to the community in general, that they may readily judge of the great
difference between the Celestial Constitution of this murdering Tyrant
and that of a more humane and benevolent character.
OF THE QUALITY OF THE MIND.
The quality of the native’s mind, understanding and judgment, with
all other faculties of the soul, depend on the position and configurations
of Mercury, as the great Ptolemy informs us in his Quadripartite;
whose words are these—(i
The qualities of the mind, as rational and mental,
are judged from the constitution of Mercury ;
but whatsoever respects the
sense alone, or what is irrational, is considered from the more corporeal
state of the Lights, that is, of the Moon and Stars, configurated by sepa-
ration or application.”
In
of BONAPARTE. 09
In this figure we find Mercury posited in the sign Leo ;
and tne sun,
his depositor, beholds the ascendant by a sextile in mundo. Mercury is
also in a mundane parallel with Venus, lady of the ascendant, and she
in sextile with Mars ;
which indicate the native to possess strong intellec-
tual abilities. But in this case, when we observe Mercury has lately sepa-
rated from the body of Saturn, in the radical figure, and that the moon
has both by longitude and latitude just separated from an exact opposition
of Saturn, who is in the figure of birth very evil and unfortunate, and
that her application to the opposition of Mercury is of evil importance,
as the moon is consequently of the nature of Saturn in the figure of
birth ; therefore, from these and other configurations, we may infer, that
the native will possess violent intellectual abilities and that he will always
be desirous of public fame, is very evident from the position of Venus,
lady of the ascendant, in a cardinal sign ;
and the moon and Saturn being
located in violent cardinal signs likewise, and angular; neither does the
position of the sun, so strongly elevated in the ascending part of heaven
with the Lyon’s Heart, corroborate this judgment in an inferior degree.
In fine, it is from these and other concurring configurations, that we are
enabled to form an accurate idea of the quality of the native’s mind, See.
which is correctly pointed out by the application of the opposition of
the moon and Mercury in particular; and as the moon is angular, and
Mercury in a fixed sign,
it indicates the native to be rash, violent and
arbitrary,
unjust and presumptious in his undertakings, performing many
things without deliberation ; and as the moon is in opposition of Saturn,
it indicates the native to be deceitful above all comprehension, and guilty
of murder, rapine, robbery, and the most abominable crimes and practices.
I have an author before me, who says, that the before-mentioned confL
^ gurations
70 The NATIVITY
gurations of the moon, and Mercury applying, indicate, “ unconstant per-
sons, malicious, turbulent, envious, perfidious liars, to purpose ; deceitful,
inventing destructive plots, infamous, meddling with every body and every
matter.”-—I have also many nativities in my possession at this time, wherein
similar positions and configurations are observable ; and as the persons
are now living, their diabolical practices, unwarrantable actions, and cruel
disposition of mind, confirm this judgment.
Now it is my wish, that the candid and impartial reader would look
upon this man’s figure of birth, and compare it with the list of his black
and diabolical actions, which he committed during his continuance in Egypt,
and other places. It is a fact, beyond the reach of contradiction, that
Bonaparte, having three thousand eight hundred prisoners, of the Turks,
he ordered them to be marched to a rising ground near Jaffa, (as the
author of his life informs us), where a division of French infantry formed
against them ; when the Turks had entered into their fatal alignment, and
the mournful preparations completed, the signal gun bred, vollies of mus-
quetry and grape instantly played against them, and Bonaparte,
who had
been regarding the scene through a telescope, when he saw the smoke
ascending could not restrain his joy,
hut broke out into exclamations of
approval! When the Turks had fallen, the French troops humanely
endeavoured to put a period to the sufferings of the wounded ;
but some
time elapsed before the bayonet could finish what the fire had not destroyed,
and probably many languished days in agony ! Several French officers,
by whom these details are partly furnished, declared that this was a scene,
the retrospect of which tormented their recollection, and that they did
not reflect on it without horror, accustomed as they had been to sights
of cruelty ! !
But
oj BONAPARTE. n
But the history of Bonaparte's black and unparalleled crimes do not
end here. At Jaffa he found his hospitals crowded with sick, and sent
for a physician, whose name should be inscribed in letters of gold, but
which, from important reasons, cannot be inserted ; on his arrival, he
entered into a long conversation with him respecting the danger of con-
tagion, concluding at last with the remark, that something must be done
to remedy the evil, and that the destruction of the sick already in the
hospital,
was the only means which could he adopted ! The physician,
alarmed at the proposal, bold in the confidence of virtue, and the cause
of humanity, remonstrated vehemently respecting the cruelty, as well as
the atrocity, of such a murder ;
but finding that Bonaparte persevered,
and menaced, he indignantly left the tent, with this memorable obser-
vation, — Neither my principles, nor the character of my profession, will
allow me to become a murderer: and, General, if such qualities, as you
insinuate,
are necessary to form a great man, I thank my Gcd that I do
not possess them."—Bonaparte was not to be diverted from his object by
moral considerations,—he persevered, and found an apothecary who (dreading
the weight of power, but who since has made an atonement to his mind
by unequivocally confessing the fact) consented to become his agent, and
to administer poison to the sick ; opium at night was distributed in
gratifying food! The wretched unsuspecting victims banqueted, and in
a few hours, five hundred and eighty soldiers, who had suffered so much
for their country, perished thus miserably by the order of its idol ! !
If a doubt should still exist as to the veracity of this statement,
let the Members of the Institute of Cairo be asked what passed in
their sitting aftei the return of Bonaparte from Syria ; they will relate
that the same virtuous physician who refused to become the destrover
j
of
The NATIVITY
/ 2
of those committed to his protection, accused Bonaparte of high trea-
son, in the full assembly, against the honor of France, her children, and
humanity ; —that lie entered into the full details of the poisoning of
the sick, and the massacre of the garrison ; aggravating these crimes
by charging Bonaparte with strangling previously,
at Rosetta ,
a number
of French and Copts, who were ill of the plague. Thus proving, that
this disposal of the sick was a premeditated plan, which he washed to
introduce into general practice
It is needless here to record the numerous diabolical deeds of this
inhuman and unmerciful Despot, wr
ho has hitherto succeeded in many
of his designs beyond the conception of many. But I do positively
assert, that whatever armies may invade the territories of the Grand
Signior, and he that succeeds him, shall most assuredly be cut to
pieces in the end, and perish in the daring enterprise. (See my former
Publication, page 208 .)
From what has been mentioned, wr
e may readily observe the threat-
ening disposition of our enemy ; but let me inform this Despot, the
time is coming, and is now near at hand, when he will be no proof
against what God has decreed from eternity. His undaunted “ mouth
speaketh proud things,”—but all his efforts put in execution together,
will not be able to succeed, nor prevail against Great Britain. The
Almighty, in his favor to us, will protect us from the plots and
schemes of the Tyrant, who is the avowed enemy of Europe. In the
conclusion of the contest. Great Britain alone will restore lasting
tranquillity to all Powers who are, and will be, in hostile stations.
Then shall England be triumphant in the cause, and give Peace
to the surrounding nations. But Time, the father of Truth, must
consequently determine the verity of this prediction.

OF THE NATIVES HONOR AND DIGNITY.
In this case, the learned Ptolemy informs us, that, in giving
judgment respecting honor and dignities, we are to consider the
“ disposition of the lights, and the familiarity of the stars by which
they are guarded. Therefore, if both the lights be found in masculine
signs, and either both or one of them angular, that is, the sun by
day, and the moon by night, chiefly the conditionary ;
and especially
if they have the satellitium of the five planets, the sun being guarded
by oriental stars, and the moon by occidental, they that are born will
be kings ;
and if the guarding stars be angular, or configurated to the
superior cardinal house of heaven, they will be great and powerful, as
lords of the the world, &c.
It is well known to the public, that this man is invested with the
greatest power that Franck is able to confer on him. In his figure
of birth we find the sun strongly dignified in the ascending part of
heaven with the Lyon’s Heart, and in a mundane sextile with the ascendant
and Jupiter, (who is in sextile with Mars, and who has dignities in
the midheaven also), beholds the cusp of the tenth house, the angle of
honor and dignity, with a mundane trine aspect. Venus also, who
is the significatrix of the native, is posited in a cardinal sign in trine
to
74 The NATIVITY
to Jupiter applying ;
and so is the moon, and Saturn likewise, located
in angular stations, and in a mundane square to the ascendant. These
are the particular reasons that I give for the native’s attaining to dignity
and preferment ; and as the moon is in opposition of Saturn, from
angles and cardinal signs, See. it is evident he will become an enemy to
himself, and endeavour to support his grandeur and advancement by
violent and arbitrary means ; and treat with unbecoming pride and in-
solence, every small obstacle in his way to honor and dignity, till time
with him shall be no more.
OF DEATH,
AND THE QUALITY THEREOF,
In the Quadripartite of the immortal Ptolemy we shall find ample
instructions, which will of course enable us to judge of the quality of
this man’s death. And, therefore, as there are many testimonies to
convince us that death will not happen in its proper and natural quality,
we must consequently attend to the rules of Ptolemy respecting that
important subject, which are as follow :
— But violent and remarka-
ble deaths happen, when both the malefics are lords of the anaretic
places, or are joined, square, oppose, or otherwise evilly affect both the
lights, or the sun alone, or the moon, or both, or one of the two
for
of BONAPARTE. 1 5
for then the mischievousness of death proceeds from the congress of
the malefics ;
but the greatness of the death, from the testimony of the
lights.
« Its quality is known from the rest of the aspecting stars, and the
signs containing the malefics.
“ Saturn, therefore, squaring or opposing the sun, contrary to con-
dition, in fixed signs, causes death by suffocation, by tumults of the
people, by hanging or strangling. In like manner he doth the same, if
he be occidental, and the moon follow. If he be in beast- like formed,
either signs or places, he causeth to perish by wild beasts. And if
Jupiter favors and is infected by the malefics, it will be in public and
celebrated places, sometimes by condemnation to die; if he be in the
west, opposing either of the luminaries, the native will end his life in
prison ;
being configurated to Mercury, especially about the serpents
which are in his sphere, or if found in earthy signs, they will die by
poison.
“ And Venus being joined to them, death will occur by poison,
and the treachery of women ;
in Virgo or Pisces or in moist signs
configurated to the moon, he will cause death by water, being suffocated
and drowned. If lie be found about Argo, by shipwreck. If he be in
tropical or equinoxial signs, and instead of the sun, Mars be there, he
will cause death from falling. If they culminate, death will happen by
precipitation from on high: Saturn, therefore, will cause such things,
being configurated with them, as is said.
66
Mars squaring or opposing the sun or moon contrary to condition
in signs of human form, he will cause death by slaughter, either civil,
hostile, or by himself.
“ If
76 The NATIVITY
a If Jupiter, evilly affected or deprived of all Ids dignities, give
testimony to Mars, death will happen through the anger of kings, and
condemnation. If the malefics especially agree together, and so oppose
any of the said places, they make the cruelty of the death the more ;
but the quality of death,
and the dominion, will offer near that which
is in the anaretic.
“When both the malefics have respect to the anaretic places such
shall be cast out unburied, and be consumed by beasts and birds ; and
chiefly when the malefics are found in signs, in the form of beasts or
birds, &c”
I have here quoted Ptolemy, whose precepts are allowed by all to
be consistent with reason, truth, and observation ; and now we shall
come to apply them to this nativity under consideration. That the sun is
the giver of life no man can deny, and that luminary alone must be directed
for death. The moon is not very violently oppressed by Mars in the
radical figure, except only by the sequiquadrate ; but as I have said
before, the ascendant is afflicted by the mundane square of Saturn,
and the same point of heaven is also oppressed by the square of
the moon in mundo. The sun is also conjoined with a violent fixed
star, and the moon is afflicted by the opposition of Saturn, so that the
whole position, duly considered, forebodes a violent death. But I humbly
conceive we have not sufficient testimony of affliction from Mars, by
the position alone, to confirm our judgment respecting the quality of
death from this configuration of Mars with the moon ; for the before-
mentioned rules of Ptolemy inform us, that “ Mars squaring or opposing
the sun, or moon, contrary to condition, in signs of human form, he will
cause death by slaughter, either civil, hostile, or by himself.”—
Now
of BONAPARTE. 77
i
Now, in this man’s nativity, Mars, though posited in a sign of human form,
yet he is not afflicting cither of the luminaries in the way and manner
above described, for he is neither in square or opposition to either of
them ;
therefore it is chiefly from the position of Saturn, and his confi-
gurations with the luminaries, that we must define the quality of the
native’s death.
The moon is posited in the celestial constitution very unfortunate,
being angular and in a violent cardinal sign, in opposition to Saturn, who
is likewise angular, and evilly disposed, and posited also in a cardinal
sign. Now, in a case of this nature, the rules of Ptolemy are applicable ;
for he informs us, in plain terms, that, “ Saturn squaring or opposing
the sun, contrary to condition, in fixed signs, causes death by suffocation,
by tumults ot the people, by hanging or strangling ;
in like manner he
doth the same, if he be occidental, and the moon follow.” Therefore, in
this geniture, we have not the sun. in opposition or square of Saturn from
fixed signs, but we find the moon afflicted by that malefic in a far greater
/ degree than if the opposition had happened alone in fixed signs ; for it
is evident that this affliction must be much greater, falling from violent
cardinal signs, and augmented by angular positions, as I have said before
so that the fury of the affliction is more than doubled in this case ; from
which we may conclude, that- a violent death is every way visible through-
out the whoie of the figure, which suffocation, &c. will be the means
to produce in the end.
But as the positions and configurations of the celestial bodies in this
geniture are so remarkably violent, let us take a more minute survey of
the position of Satui n, and the moon, in the radix; for, by their particular
positions, &c. we must in this case judge of the Quality of Death, as
M Ptolemy
The NATIVITY
79
Ptolemy further informs us, for he says, “ Saturn posited in moist signs,
configurated to the moon, he will cause death by water, being suffocated
and drowned.” Now it is obvious that the moon and Saturn are exactly
so posited in this figure, as to be productive of the same quality of death
as that which I have just mentioned: though we have some testimonies
that “ Death will happen by slaughter—either civil, hostile, or by himself
which I judge from the directions of Mars, combined with those of the
moon and Saturn, for his dissolution ; from which mixture of rays death
will happen in a moment. But we are not to suppose, by any means,
that, in every nativity we meet with, where we find an opposition of the
moon and Saturn, that the native will perish by water or shipwreck, by
tumults of the people, the sword, or strangling, &c. as in this case,—
for such occurrences can only take place when that violently afflicted luminary
proves to be the Poiothanatos, or in violent and malevolent configuration
with that malefic star who is so.
Having said sufficient respecting the quality of this Tyrant
1
s death
which you see is violent beyond all question, I shall now conclude this
part of the subject, and give you my opinion what directions I allow7
for
his dissolution.
That the sun is the true apheta, or giver of life, every one will
readily admit; and to his directional motion wT
e must look for death. It
is true, the sun to the sextile of Jupiter in mundo, by direct direction,
will keep off the fury and violence of the first directions for a time, but
the directions of the hyleg (which I allow to be mortal) are these, viz.
The sun to the parallels of the moon and Saturn in mundo, by direct
and converse motion, and also to the rapt parallel of Mars, and that fol-
lowed by the moon to the opposition of Mars, as you may see in the
table
of BONAPARTE. /
v
9
table preceding, for the most violent of the above directions will operate
at the time therein mentioned, which I judge will be mortal; notwith-
standing the effects of the mundane sextile of Jupiter which precedes, it
cannot break the train at that period, according to my judgment. But
perhaps you will say, Why is the moon to the opposition of Mars men-
tioned amongst those preceding for his death ?—Answer, In all cases, when
a train of violent directions are in operation to the giver of life, as in
this nativity, then consequently the moon to the opposition of Mars (though
that luminary is not the giver of life) will certainly add great violence to
the effects of the former directions. And the direction of the sun to
the sextile of Saturn in the zodiac, will likewise be productive of more
evil than many will imagine. The sentiments of the great Ptolemy, on
this subject, are as follow: —“But the places of the malefics, Saturn and
Mars, kill according to the prorogation made to the following signs, when
they either meet bodily or cast their rays from any where, whether it be
square or opposition, and sometimes in sextiles, proceeding from signs obe-
dient or beholding, because of their equipolence, and also a square confi-
guration from the following signs to the aphetic place ; and also a sextile
evilly affected when it is in signs of long ascension :
yea, and besides the
trine in signs of short ascension kill, as will the solar place if the moon be
hyleg : and the rancounters made in such a prorogation can till or save,
because such occourses are carried to the aphetic place direct.”
From these rules we may readily judge, that the direction of the
sun to the sextile of Saturn, is endowed with evil and violent qualities
but cannot kill, because the ia^ys of Jupiter follow ; for the direction
of Saturn s sextile before-mentioned, falls in signs of long' ascension, which
is equal to the power of a square : and likewise the sun to the trine
of
80 The NATIVITY
X
of the moon, is a direction of evil and malevolent import ; for though this
trine aspect has not power of itself to destroy life, yet being configurated
with others of violent power and efficacy, it consequently augments the
force of their malignity, and more particularly in this nativity, where the
moon is of the nature of the malefics.
The native’s revolutional figures, for the years 1805, 1806, and 1807,
are remarkably evil, for tranquillity, &c., and violent in the extreme; for
we there find, in the former, Saturn and Mars in conjunction, near the
cusp of his radical horoscope, and in a violent mundane square to the
place of Venus in the celestial constitution ; and Venus, the significatrix
of the native, is transiting the radical place of Mars, being conjoined with
Mercury in that station : Jupiter has nearly returned to his radical place,
still beholding the cusp of the midheaven, in the genethliacal figure, by a
trine in mundo. The moon, in the revolutional figure, has just passed
an opposition with Saturn and Mars at that time, and going to the square
of her own radical position, and likewise to the square of Saturn’s radical
place. The sun still remains in square of Jupiter, and, from the nature of
the directions, &c. it appears, the more this Despot endeavours to extend
his territories, by cruel and wasteful war, the more dangerous will his situ-
ation be: for it is plain, from what I have premised, that he will become
justly detested, and heinously hated, by the people of the surrounding nations,
for his abominable and odious actions, which, for cruelty, remain unequalled
in the annals of history.

AN
EXAMINATION OF A TREATISE
LATELY PUBLISHED,
OJV THIS JVALTIVITY.
Since I wrote this, I have seen a Treatise on this Nativity, lately
printed, by a Mr. Thomas Orger, of Wycombe, —and as the calculation
and judgment therein given, do not correspond with the general rules of
the learneu, Ptolemy, I shall take the liberty to examine the major
part of the work in an impartial manner,
and give you my reasons, in
each particular case, why I do not coincide with the opinion of the Author,
as to the time of birth in particular, and other instances of no small im-
portance ;
the purport of which I shall now lay before the learned and
unprejudiced reader.
The great difference in time between the figure of birth I have here
printed, and that published by Mr. Orger, is very considerable, as any person
may perceive, by inspection ;
and this being the true state of the business,
it must appear obvious to every one, that owing to this great difference in
time, the major part of the calculation will differ in proportion. The time
printed
82 The NATIVITY
printed by Mr. Orger, is, August 13 th, 1769, Hh. 40 m. 48 s. A.M. ; and
the celestial figure given by me in this publication, has twenty-one degrees
fifteen minutes of Cancer on the midheaven, which, in time, answers to
the 15 th of August, 1769, Qh. 51 m. 40 s. A.M., so that the difference
between us in time, will be, one hour forty-nine minutes and eight seconds;
which difference will consequently create much variation in the celestial
constitution, with respect to the mundane aspects, and parallels in the
world, he.
Now, observing that there is this great difference between us in the
time of this man’s birth, I conceive it a duty incumbent on me at this time,
to inform the intelligent reader, that Bonaparte’s Nativity was calcu-
lated, several years ago, by a learned and celebrated Astronomer, in
Corsica,
(as I have said in another place), and all the important occurrences
exactly foretold. The estimate time of birth, given to the Astronomer,
was, a quarter of an hour before ten o’clock in the morning of the fifteenth
of August, 1769; and in rectifying this estimate time, he only made a very
small alteration, hardly worthy of observation : and it is wgll known to
many gentlemen, of distinguished reputation and ability, that what I have
here inserted is authentic ;
from which it must appear evident, that Bona-
parte is certainly the best judge in ascertaining the time of his own birth,
let othefs say what they please to the contrary.
Now if I may be admitted to deliver my opinion on the native’s figure
of birth, given by the Author, I conclude it to be a made one,
—“ set off
after the fine mode,
with fine talk and flourish which, indeed, may
suit the inclinations of some people very well, especially those whp are
willing to believe the greatest sophism without asking ;
but we know there
are many so disposed, therefore we need not wonder if some embrace the
sen-
of BONAPARTE. 83
sentiments and jine-polished arguments delivered by the Author on Bona-
parte’s Nativity ;
for it must appear evident to every one who understands
only the first principles of this department of Astronomy, that the time
of birth was altered by the Author for the purpose of bringing the sun
very near the cusp of the midheaven, and Jupiter in the ascendant.
in order to make the thing look big, without any use whatsoever,
only
to make him live (as he says) to be sixty-nine years old, and die a natural
death. But let him not deceive himself in a circumstance of this nature,
for I do positively assert, that in altering the figure, in the way and manner
he has performed it, has much aggravated the testimonies of violence in
many instances, relative to directional motion in particular, which the
meanest capacity shall understand, in some measure, before I finish tin's
treatise.
After the Author has given us the corrected figure of birth, as he
is pleased to stile it, he then presents us with “A Table of the Fortitudes
and Debilities of the Planets,” extracted from page 115 of Mr. Lilly’s
Introduction, which is entirely useless, and not at all appertaining to the
genuine and profound Principles of this Science, as it is delivered to us
by the great and immortal Ptolemy, in his Quadripartite ; and though
this mode of taking the debilities and fortitudes of the planets in a nati-
vity may appear to some to be of use, yet it is only adapted to create
great trouble, being void of advantage: indeed, it is one of the old Arabian
whims and absurdities, there being many of them now in fashion, which
will by no means stand the test of an impartial examination.
In the Table of the Fortitudes and Debilities of the Planets, collected
by the Author, we are told, that a planet being combust of the sun, has
five accidental debilities; and also, that if a planet be in Oazimi. he has
five
I
8 i - The -NATIVITY
five accidental dignities ; which must seem very extraordinary to any rea-
sonable man,—that it a person remains at a considerable distance from a
large fire he will then receive great injury from it, but if he creeps into
the middle of it, he will he greatly strengthened and refreshed by its power /
Indeed, all such absurd whims as these, cannot be too much reprobated
and condemned, they being much like the light, dark,
and s?noky degrees,
deep and pitted, Sec. See. which no sensible man, I am certain, will ever
give the least credit to, though they were, many of them, handed down
to us by bearded antiquity.
The Author has given us an Explanation of the Characters of the
Planets, Signs, and Aspects, almost at the beginning of the book, which
is certainly of no importance to the reader in many instances, except the
work had been introductory to the science ;
but these things, as well as
many others, I shall pass by at present, and examine how the directions
and positions agree in each particular case with the occurrences of the
native’s life ; for it appears obvious, from the Author’s book, that he does
not wish to speak any thing against Bonaparte, respecting his inhuman
and diabolical acts. He also says, (in page 15), that, “ I shall feci myself
sometimes overswayed by prejudice, against the influence of which, I shall
endeavour as much as possible to guard.”
We are informed by the Author, that in this nativity he has found
testimonies for long life ;
and that the native will remain free from bodily
hurts in war ;
and acquire riches, honor, and power. He also says, he
has found out the exact minute of Bonaparte’s birth, by rectification,
which is that expressed in his figure ;
but how true and exact this will
prove, you will observe hereafter. He also says, that
“ the ascendant may
be said to be strongly martialized, and strongly solarized, and in that triple
capa-
of BONAPARTE. 85
capacity Jupiter becomes a principal significator.” This seems to be a
strange rugged doctrine to me, therefore pray see if you can find any
thing equal to it in Ptolemy’s Quadripartite, which I am certain you
cannot, nor any thing like it ; for he there teaches us a doctrine quite the
reverse to that before-mentioned. Indeed, we are informed, that the native
received a wound in the face, on the 12th of October, 1800, which the
Author seems to indicate is visible from the position alone, which must
appear very strange to any one one that understands it, that Mars in
sextile to Jupiter, &c., should make his carriage break down at the time
above-mentioned, and produce a scar in the face. Now my opinion is,
that this accident is pointed out by another cause, which you will find plainly
delivered by the great Ptolemy, in page lOo of his Quadripartite. But
those who are disposed to countenance the simple ideas and absurd whims
of the Arabian Doctors,
and the books of Gadbury,
Coley,
Parker,
Lilly
and others, as the Author has done, instead of the genuine Principles of
this Science, as they are set forth by the immortal Ptolemy, I will by
no means endeavour to be their hinderance.
We are now arrived at that part of the Author’s work, where he
treats of the Effects of the Midheaven to the Body of Mars ; he also says,
that “ the effects of its force did not cease from the time of its com-
mencement, till the time of making peace with England, nor even then
v
did it quite cease, but meeting with another direction of the same nature,
he again commenced war.” Now can any man suppose that the effects
of this direction have any thing to do with either making peace or war
with England? No! and I say it is the greatest folly to suppose it:
for we ought, first of all, to consider the strength and disposition of the
astral representatives of those nations concerned in the event of war and
N com-
The NATIVITY
86
commotion by the mundane part of this science, which is of much greater
importance in some part of this judgment, than the nativity of a single
individual.
In the next place he gives us the testimonies collected for a long
and short Life which is another Arabian whim, as absurd as the former.
But the great Ptolemy does not mention a word concerning the matter,
about testimonies, &c. ; and therefore informs us how, and by what means,
we are to judge, in all nativities, whether the native will live to years of
maturity. These rules and precepts you will find in page 136, 137 arid 138,
of the Quadripartite ;
and they are so substantial, that they will never
be found to fail, if proper attention be paid to them : therefore, I believe
I need say no more on this part of the subject. Indeed, the Author tells
us there are “ Seventeen testimonies for long life, and only four for the
contrary, leaving a surplus of thirteen in favor of his living to a good age."
Now I wish to be informed what he calls “ a good age?" Precious folly
indeed ! and those who are inclined to believe it, must certainly be good-
natured men! For it must be allowed by all those who know any thing
about the matter, that when the Hyleg, or Giver of Life, meets with a
violent train of directions, without sufficient support and assistance from
the benevolent planets, death then certainly becomes the consequence.
Therefore, as I believe no other doctrine but that taught by Ptolemy, I
shall now examine the opinion of the Author, concerning the Quality of
the Native’s Death.
In observing the judgment of the Author respecting the Quality of
the Native’s Death, or whether his dissolution will be natural or violent
we find he has collected testimonies for a natural death ,
just equal in number
to those of long life. How astonishing it must appear, that the Author
should
4
of BONAPARTE. *
87
should present the public with a multiplicity of those old Arabian and
Babylonian absurdities, displayed only to undermine truth and reason, and
turn those out of the way who are in pursuit thereof. I could also prove,
without much trouble, that several of the directions inserted by the Author,
are by no means applicable to the past occurrences of the native’s life.
Indeed we are told, in ostentatious terms, after the old mode, that when
Bonaparte was about fifteen years of age, he “ fortified his garden, and
blowed up his schoolfellows with gunpowder ;
and had he not been prevented,
would have committed further excess of violence.” Did ever any body hear
such pomposity as this is ? And we are also told, that this event took
place under the influence of the mundane parallel of the sun and Mars.
Now is not this extraordinary, that the mundane parallel of the sun and
i
Mars should operate so violently as to blow the native’s schoolfellows up
with gunpowder,-
and the midheaven to the body of Mars give him every
success in accumulating great riches, &c. ?—And here I observe that the
/
Author has made mention, twice in the same page, what great riches the
native accumulated under the influence of the direction of the midheaven
to the body of Mars ; for he says, “ it may be considered as a triple direc-
•
tion, and one of the strongest that can occur ; for as Mars at birth was
besieged between the two sextiles of Jupiter and Venus, he collects both
their benevolent rays in a most powerful manner, so that it iss equal to a
direction of the midheaven to Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, all at once.”- —
Now I will ask any man, but moderately versed in this science, whether the
midheaven to the body of Mars is likely to be productive of those immense
riches, so much talked of by the Author, when Mars is so violently afflicting
the moon by a mundane parallel, &c. ? And, to tell you the truth, in plain
t.crms, the midheaven to the body of Mlars (in such an imperfect fgure
as
88 The NATIVITY
as the Author has made) is never likely to be productive of riches ; but,
on the contrary, the most direful consequences may always be expected
from the effects of that direction. But I observe he lays great stress on the
sextiles of Jupiter and Venus, with Mars, which I do not, because those
sextiles are in signs of long ascension,
which is equal to the power of a square,
as Ptolemy informs us in this case; but if it had not so happened, those
configurations would have been of no importance, because their influence is
overpowered by the violent mundane parallel of Saturn with Mars, from
that important angle the midheaven : the moon also, who is of the nature
of the malefics, is likewise in a mundane parallel with Mars, as I have said
before, and also oppressed by his violent sesquiquadrate, which are equal to
the power of a conjunction or opposition ; therefore, the influence of the
sextiles of Jupiter and Venus, with Mars, so much depended on by the
Author, is in this case totally frustrated. Therefore how can it be supposed
that the midheaven to the body of Mars (if the figure was correct, which I
do not allow) should give the native the immense riches mentioned by the
Author ;
indeed the effects of that direction are always attended with the
most violent consequences. And observing that the Author has quoted
Mr. Lilly, on the effects of those directions which indicate some good to
the native, and has passed over every circumstance that is prejudicial,
according to the best writers on the science, I shall therefore in this case
extract from Mr. Lilly’s Introduction, (page 67 l)> the effects of the mid-
heaven to the body of Mars, that you may judge whether such a direction
is likely to be productive of riches and make a man a Commander in Chief,
See., as the Author informs us was the case ;
and you may believe it, if
you please to believe falshood and deception, which I shall never do while I
breathe,—for I am an Englishman, and I write as an Englishman, —therefore,
if
of BONAPARTE. *9
if I tell you the truth in plain terms I humbly conceive you will not be
offended^ except you only wish to hear stated the fair side of the question
alone. Mr. Lilly says, that the effects of the midheaven to the body of Mars,
“ plunders the native into the greatest mischances, both of life and fortune,
that may be mischiefs arising, the native not knowing from whom, it stirs
up the wrath of powerful men, especially martialists, against him ;
it threatens
banishment, imprisonment, hatred, miserable and fearful consumption of
patrimony, by fire, theft, &c. In a King’s or Prince’s nativity, it incites
them to war, to wrong their subjects, to carry themselves proudly and inso-
lently towards them ;
to murder, or be the occasion of the effusion of much
blood.”—Thus you see Mr. Lilly does not tell us that the midheaven to
the body of Mars is at all productive of riches, &c., but the reverse ; and
therefore how the Author conceived such an idea, I know not ; it might
probably suit his purpose at that time ;
for I am certain no man can credit
the assertion, if he knows any thing of this science.
In like manner, the Author tells us of the Effects of the Sun to the
Parallel Declination of Mars ; which he says was calculated to endanger
his life ;
for Sol being the Apheta, or sustainer of life in this nativity, he of
course, directed to the parallel of Mars, would produce danger.” And we
are also told, that under the power of this direction, some young officers
threatened to throw Bonaparte over into a deep ditch, but Saturn, overruled
the danger. Hah ! hah ! hah ! these are strange principles, and I am certain
every intelligent man in this science must of course view them with contempt ;
for can you believe that Saturn, the great infortune by nature in the heavens,
is at any time likely to override danger, when it is at hand ? No ;
I have
0 '
nevei yet seen an instance of that nature in the course of my practice, and
I am certain never shall.
But
90 The NATIVITY
Bat all such absurdities as these are, can be of no avail whatsoever, if
you please to give credit to those unerring rules that the great and immortal
Ptolemy has left to posterity ;
rules I say they are, which no man can
rectify or amend,—and whoever attempts it, will certainly fall into error and
confusion.
Now concerning the Effects of the Sun to the Parallel Declination of
Mars, I am clearly of opinion it passed over without being productive of any
thing worthy of notice, because the rays of the benevolents followed immedi-
ately after. And as to the sun to the body of Mars, which the Author says
“ is strongly of a military nature,” that I shall certainly deny, and quote the
opinion of Mr. Lilly, in his Introduction, page 682,
concerning the matter
in question : who says, that the Sun to the Body of Mars, “ loads the body
with many infirmities, afflicts it with excess of choler, with sharp acute
fevers, with bitter pains of head-ach, vitiates the sight of the eyes with
dulness, or other casualties, deforms the face with wounds or scars, and the
rest of the body with iron, fire, or hot scalding water ;
it designs the native
to be inconstant, and variable in his councils, cogitations, and actions ; and
that he shall meet with many labors and difficulties, by reason of wicked,
pernicious persons or malefactors ;
his enemies will domineer over him
the native shall easily fall into the hatred and frowns of kings and great men ;
and he ought to be careful of receiving prejudice or hurt by the biting of
a mad do:r, or kick of a horse, or some other four-footed creature : its good
in this year he avoid soldiers. Unto a martial nativity, it gives preferment:
it bids kings beware of poison and treachery : when a violent death is signi-
fied, it shews the time or occasion thereof is at hand : in moist signs, its a
sure sign of the bloody flux.”—Here then you may observe whether there is
the least portion of benevolence attending the influence of this direction ;
indeed,
of BONAPARTE. 91
indeed, I believe its effects are always of a violent and evil nature, and
more particularly in this nativity, where strong testimonies of violence are
visible.
Now what shall we make of the opinion of the Author concerning
various circumstances, and the partiality he has used in the course of
%
his calculations; indeed it will consequently be admitted by every one, that
he ought to have delivered the true Language of the Heavenly Bodies,
in all instances, through the course of his work, and in so doing he would
have been justifiable, so far as the judgment extended. But instead of that
being the case, we find he has extracted every circumstance out of Mr. Lilly’s
Introduction,
that can possibly be productive of the least eenevolence to
the native, and has passed by every thing that is prejudicial ;
indeed, with
some unthinking persons, any thing ivill do. And though the Author has
delivered some part of his judgment in the most pompous manner, as some
may suppose, yet, from what has been premised, I am clearly of opinion,
that very few will give credit to French assertions,—for Bonaparte
says, he “ fears none of the chances of war and the Author says, he will
live to the age of sixty-nine years ; —but let him not deceive himself, for
I positively say, it is a time the native will never live to see.
We are told, that “ the sun to the wrapt conjunction of Saturn,”
shewed its effects in the year 1800, and is calculated to endanger the native’s
v
life ;
and on the 24th of December in the same year, an attempt was made
“ to blow him up as he was going to the opera, by means of a barrel of
gunpowder in a cart, but it was fired rather too late to have the desired
effect, and only hurt the rear of his guard.”- -Now here we find the Author
attending to the effects of transits, as he has done throughout the whole
of his work, as if they were endowed with qualities similar to the effects
of
The NATIVITY
02
4/
ot violent and furious directions. I believe, if you read the Quadripartite
of Ptolemy, you will find very little to be gathered in favor of such simple
ideas ;
for it is well known to those who understand the rules and genuine
principles of this science, that it is from the effect of directional motion-
alone, that the Length of Life is sought out and ascertained, and other
momentous occurrences likewise, without having regaid to such simple whims
as transits. And the laborious Mr. Partridge, in pa. 86 and 8 7 of his
Defectio Genituraram,
has sufficiently discountenanced such absurdities ;
I shall therefore extract the judgment of that Author from the above pages,
which is to this effect :
“ I know', by my conversation among intelligent
men in this learning, that transits are, and have been, esteemed dangerous,
and endued wfith a power to kill ;
and that many men will rely on the
pow'er of an ill transit or twr
o, to judge this or that man did expire by, and
that there were no other causes for death but only that transit, that they
shall alledge and think fit. But J confess they seldom make use of this
thing but in nativities where the persons are dead, and they can find no
direction fit to be assigned for it, and therefore in such cases they have
recourse to transits. Nor did I ever know7
any of that opinion durst ven-
ture to predict a man’s death by a transit ; nay, though there were half
a dozen bad transits together, they do not dare rely on them, and say they
will kill ;
but that they have killed,—that I have often heard them say,
when the work was over, and death had taken possession.— -Now if this
should be true, it is very strange that some ingenious man or other had
not in all this time licked this doctrine into shape and form, sufficient to
have assisted the artist in his judgment on death : for it is certain, if
they do ever kill, it is possible to foresee when they will, and when they
will not, by a continual observation thereof ;
and one or twr
o experiments
of
of BONAPARTE. 93
of this kind would mightily clear the doubt, and convince its adversaries,
and prove the point in dispute against all aiguments v\hatsoe\ci ,
hut to
this time all volumes are silent in the matter, and their authors, and the
artists themselves are mute and destitute of experiments of that kind,
i. e. of death fairly predicted beforehand, by a transit, or transits, and
nothing else. The truth is, if we will but give ourselves leave to consider
iiow many violent and dangerous transits a man passeth in forty or fifty
years, and not kill him, it would be sufficient of itself to confront this
doctrine, and convince its favorites, that there is nothing of truth in the
thing, and wholly take off' their opinion of its power.”
Thus you may observe, that Mr. Partridge well understood direc-
tions of every denomination ;
but as concerning the effects of transits, he
utterly condemns as groundless and unwarrantable, though we find the
Author of Bonaparte’s Nativity endeavouring to make the unlearned em-
brace such vague notions ;
yet if people would choose truth for the criterion,
all those absurd ideas would quickly vanish ;
for to speak the truth respecting
the matter in question, the Author’s book, together with the judgment, is
nearly altogether depending on transits, which are things even next to nothing
in themselves. And in page 26,
he has outdone all the authors I have ever
read ;
for, says he, “ there happened a transit of Mercury over the sun's
disk in the 14th degree of Scorpio.” What then ? and what is to be ex-
pected from the effects of that transit ? Why, something remarkable to be
sure, if you believe the opinion of the Author : these 6C
famous transits,”
as he is pleased to call them, will do almost every thing.—Alas ! what a
heap of whimsical stuff' is this, to be sent into the world under the name
of a Science, which our forefathers so much esteemed, studied, and prac-
tised.
o And.
9 * The NATIVITY
And the same Author informs us, that Bonaparte,
on the 23rd of
August, 1799, left Egypt and embarked for France, taking with him his
immense riches. On the subject of transits which might be considered as
operating in this Egyptian undertaking, I shall only observe, that when he
set out, Mars was in Capricorn, on the place of the radical moon, and
opposition to Saturn.” Well, and what shall we make of all this? it is
evident the celestial bodies must be in some of the signs of the zodiac, and
any of them seem to suit the Author’s judgment.—And I positively say, if
he had not given his opinion on transits, but passed by them as absurd
and vain dreams, as Mr. Partridge and others have done, his book would
have been very small indeed.—But I have one circumstance to remark, which
is, that the Author has told us of the “ immense riches” which Bonaparte
brought from Egypt in the year 1 799? but be does not tell us how those
riches were obtained, —which, to speak the truth, were gained by robbery
and murder, being the price of much innocent blood! For it is well known,
that the cries of innocent children, and the entreaties of the most impotent,
were of no avail to this merciless Tyrant ! they were instantly cut off at
his command ! But these things the Author has not attended to ; though
he has nicely picked out (without authority) all those occurrences in favor
of the Despot,—such as the testimonies of the native's honor, power, and
command,- -and those likewise for the durability of the native’s acquired
greatness.
He also tells us, “ it appears that there are no less than sixteen testi-
monies in favor of the continuance of his greatness, and not one can be fairly
$
collected on the contrary side of the question ;
hence we may rationally
conclude, that he will maintain his exalted situation in defiance of all the
efforts of those who may wish to cast him down.”—Here is absurdity dis-
played
of BONAPARTE. 93
played in the extreme, for Ptolemy teaches us a different doctrine, which
you will find in pages 183 and 184 ofhis Quadripartite. And, to tell you
in plain terms, I do by no means believe what the Author tells us about the
native’s exalted situation, &c. ; for though his power may endure for a
time, under the strength and influence of benevolent directions, yet the
position itself does by no means indicate what the Author insinuates respect-
ing the durability of the native’s honor, power, &c. But a short time will
of course determine these things.
He also tells us there are “ twenty-eight testimonies that the native
will grow rich, therefore I judge he will enjoy a superabundance, and in the
end become immensely rich.”—Now in this case the Author has given judg-
ment in a very different way and manner to every respectable writer on
this science : and the ingenious Mr. Partridge, in his Opus Reformation,
pages 48 and 49, speaks to the following effect, in giving judgment on the
riches of Oliver Cromwell, on that part ofhis Nativity I shall,” says he,
ee
consider his riches from the Part of Fortune, as the general signifieator of
wealth ; but yet, before I begin my judgment thereon, give me leave to
premise a word or two. I would not have you think, that because he arrived
to the government of a nation, and had the use and command of the king-
dom’s money and treasure, that I call him rich, for I look on that to be
but the common attendant of his honor and grandeur, and not the excel-
lence of his fortune to riches. For a king may have vast sums of money,
and yet be no rich man, as we have seen in K. C. 2 ; and a king may have
far lesser sums than ever he had, and yet be a very rich man, and lay by
him a great tieasure for his own use and posterity, distinct from the interest
of the nation and people, as was K. H. 7. —Therefore I would not be thought
to build his honor upon his riches, which is indeed no such thing, but
that
9^ The NATIVITY
that kind of Ins wealth was really founded on his honor and grandeur,
for the sword was the anvil upon which he wrought out his fortune, his
honor, &c. ;
and as that always brings a certain charge, so it usually brings
a supply of fortune to defray it. And therefore I shall consider his fortune
distinctly and separately from that which came by his honor ; and what it
might have been, had he continued in that station in which he was born
and bred.”
Thus you may observe, Mr. Partridge does not mention any thing
concerning the testimonies of riches, &c., as the Author of Bonaparte's
Nativity has done ;
neither does he predict impossibilities ; but, like an able
artist, has combined reason and truth with scientific principles, and drawn
the conclusion accordingly. But though I have mentioned this subject in
this place, I certainly acknowledge Cromwell’s Nativity to be one of the
best I ever saw, neither do I ever look upon it without admiration, as the
position itself is so remarkably eminent. While by the profound principles
of Elementary Philosophy we deliver judgment, how can we be amazed
when we consider the Geniture of Bonaparte, in many cases, to be indi-
cative of every act of violence and depredation, —for the position itself carries
with it so much of the nature of violence, in many instances, that the worst
of men living on the earth can by no means be acquainted with greater.
Now if we consider the nature of those directions given by the Author
in his book, it will appear evident that he has passed by, and consequently
unnoticed, several directions of serious import, which are made to the
sun, the giver of life, in the geniture. I say they are directions the most
malevolent and dangerous ;
so that if the time of birth given by the Author
had been correct and true, I am firmly of opinion the native could not
have escaped at that time.
Now
of BONAPARTE.
§7
Now the whole of what I have written is not done out of any dis-
respect to the Author, (as I have observed in another place) ;
only, as an
advocate in the cause of truth ,
I have expressed my sentiments in order to
undeceive those who are ready to embrace any doctrine,
without a due and
impartial examination. Therefore, in order to make good what I have said
concerning the dangerous directions to the giver of life, mentioned above,
I will here calculate them from the Author’s figure, without altering the
time of birth a minute, that you may readily apprehend the fury of those
baneful directions which threatened eminent danger, and death, at that
period.

most violent import ; for there are many others to the sun, the giver of
life, which did precede these in their effects,—such as the sun to the oppo-
sition of the moon in mundo, converse motion, and the sun to the body
of Saturn in mundo, by converse motion also ;
so that among this train of
furious directions to the Ilyleg,
we have not sufficient assistance from the
bcnefics to keep life out of danger at that time, though their rays interpose.
But according to the Author’s figure, by which I have wrought these direc-
tions, the native ought not to have escaped suffering the most dreadful
calamities, and death also, at that time, when those baneful directions ought
to have shewed their effects ;
but we do not find this to be the case, which
proves the imperfection of the Author’s figure and judgment ;
so that tlie
major part of his directions are of no importance whatever, relative to the
use he has brought them.
But perhaps some may object to the force aud power of Sesquiquadrates
and Semiquartiles in the Zodiac and Mundo, and may contend, that such
directions have yiever power to hill ; but in many nativities which I have
calculated, I have known those directions to be productive of death and
if you do not think proper to rely on my judgment respecting the matter
in question, you may read the works of the learned Placidus de Titus,
and you will there find that author treating on the effects of such direc-
tions, (which are equal to the power of a square), and acknowledging the
same to be of an inimical and malevolent nature ;
and so has Mr. Partridge
(in his Defectio Geniturarum, and Opus Reformatum) judged death in many
cases from the effects of those directions, when the parties were living, whose
dissolutions concurring with the time pointed out, have proved the truth
and verity of his calculations.
Now if any person is inclined to believe what the Author of Bonapajite s
Nati-
of BONAPARTE. 101
Nativity has insinuated,
he must in some measure suppose that the native
is something more than man, —for the power of all the seven planets toge-
ther are not able to do him any injury ! No; nor yet are the most dan-
gerous directions able to shake him !—For you see, (if you believe the
Author), that the sun passed the body of Mars in the zodiac, and mundo,
and he never flinched for that : And then the moon to the opposition of
the sun came, and the effects of that either could not, or would not hurt
him : Then came the midheaven to the body of Mars, and that could
make no work of it, either in performing injury to his life or reputation.
But then you will observe the sun came to the body of Saturn in mundo
by converse motion, and that did him but little injury, for he then enjoyed
health, I am told : And then the sun came to the mundane semiquartile of
Saturn, and mundane parallel of Mars, by direct motion ; and the sun also
to the sesquiquadrate of the moon in mundo, and mundane parallel of Mars
by converse direction,—and yet all these directions to the giver of life,
(with the ascendant united at the same time under furious rays), you see,
could not hurt him. But, by the Author’s judgment, a bad transit or two
would do more injury to the native than most or all of these baneful direc-
tions combined together.
Now what think you of this matter ? and how are such things as these
to be reconciled without confusion ? For I assure you it is not possible for
v
any man living to make me believe (if the figure and time of birth had been
correct that the effects of the before-mentioned directions made to the
giver of life, could have passed over without being productive of the most
serious consequences, and danger to the life of the native, so as to have
reduced him, by violence at last, to the yam of death. But at the time the
before-mentioned diiections were in operation, he experienced no prejudice
p to
102 The NATIVITY
to his health, by indisposition, &c. ; neither was he liable to any particular
misfortunes, as the Author informs us, but was mostly fortunate in every
undertaking. He also tells us, that under the effects of the midheaven to
the sextile of Jupiter, the native will be confirmed in his exalted situation,
and “ this will begin its operation about July, 1805 ; under its effects he
will become of a more complacent disposition than formerly, wishing more
for amity and peace, than for discord and war ; he will turn his mind and
intentions towards devising wholesome laws, that shall conduce to the well
governing of the people ; the nations will also be inclined to acknowledge
him in his diplomatic capacity : the effects of this direction’s operation will
be long, and it will be many months before it acts with its full power.
No doubt the impending conjunction of Saturn and the Georgium Sidus in
the sign Libra, together with the sextile Jupiter will form with them there,
from Sagittary, in 1805 and 1806, in co-operation with the aforesaid direc-
tion of Jupiter, will do much towards the bringing about a Peace between
England and France.” Here, then, you may observe the Author is dis-
posed to call for the aid and assistance of a new planet to help to bring
about a peace between the two nations, for the old ones of themselves will not
do, you see. And, as we are told that the native will devise “ wholesome
laws, that shall conduce to the well governing of the people, the nations will
also be inclined to acknowledge him in his diplomatic capacity, &c.,” I will
ask, if any are to be found who are ready and willing to believe such nonsen-
sical flattery,
being the purport of strange catching language f For can
you suppose the native qualified to devise “wholesome laws'’
for a nation that
has such a violent position, See. ? And these “wholesome laws'"' are to be
devised, it seems, under the effects of the midheaven to the sextile of Jupiter,
in the month of July, 1805 ; at which time, the Author informs us, that his
honor3

honor,
riches and power will increase. I will grant that he will be successful
for a time, but I say it is from other causes ;
and if any are disposed to rely
on his judgment, in this and other cases, they will consequently suffer them-
selves to be grossly imposed on. And as he has quoted the opinion of
Mr. Lilly, concerning the effects of the midheaven to the sextile of Jupiter,
which is to perforin all these great concerns,
I say Mr. Lilly never knew how
to direct the midheaven any other way than that in the zodiac, which the use
of the celestial globe will inform you was absurd, and inconsistent with reason
and truth, if you please to take a little trouble with it ;
for the angles of the
figure can only be directed in mundo ;
that,
and that only, being the true and
natural motion, appointed by God and Nature ;
and therefore how can it be
supposed that Mr. Lilly should give a correct judgment on the effects of a
direction, which he never knew how to calculate ?
The Author tells us, in page 38, that, “ to calculate a nativity throughout,
with all the directions primary and secondary, the Lunar progressions, cli-
macterical years, and the transits of the superiors over the principal places of
the significators, together with as copious a judgment of the whole as is
proper and necessary to be written, is a very laborious work, and when finished
would fill a quarto volume of several hundred pages.” I never heard a greater
falshood delivered by man than this is ; for I confidently assert, that I can at
any time calculate a nativity throughout, (with all the written necessary j
udg-
ment), in the course of three or four days ; and can you suppose I could fill
“ a quarto volume, of several hundred pages,” in that time ? No ! Mr. Par-
tridge, in his Opus Reformatum, has calculated the Nativity of Oliver Crom-
well throughout, with all the judgment written in full, and I do not find it to
exceed more than forty-two pages, which is very far distant from “ several
hundred.” So that when I find a man uttering an untruth in the least degree,
I always inspect his words, &c., with more correctness and precision.
We

not often, nor of long continuance, except when he approaches very near the
end of his race. The disorders he will be most liable to, in the former part
of his life, up to about fifty, arc inflammations of the blood, hot complaints of
the bowels, or the bilious cholic.”—But though he tells us of these things,
yet he substantiates no reasons for delivering this judgment. And as to the
directions assigned for the dissolution of the native, they are such as I should
by no means depend on to give that effect; but should much sooner relv on
the direction of the sun to his own semiquartile in mundo, and zodiacal
parallel of Mars ; which I am certain have much more power to destroy life
than the Georgium Sidus, which planet has never killed any one yet, I am
certain : and though some make much noise about the Georgium Sidus being
of the nature and influence of Saturn, yet I cannot subscribe to the truth of
such assertions, except the verity thereof be proved by proper examples, to my
satisfaction ; and therefore, if any man considers himself equal to such an
undertaking, I shall be happy to see his doctrine published.
But now we come to the consideration of death ; and the directions which
the Author tells us will kill the native, are, Sol to the parallel declination of
/ ^
the Georgium Sidus,
Sol to the opposition of the Georgium Sidus, Sol to the
mundane square of Saturn,
Sol to the zodiacal square of Saturn,
and Sol to
the rapt quintile of Mars. Now here you see plainly that the Author has
chosen a new planet to help to kill this new ((
Emperoii of all the
French,” which is a circumstance quite out of my mode of practice, and
Ptolemy’s likewise ;
for it seems he has tried the power and influence of the
old planets in vain, and they either cannot, or will not, give the native the
least sickness or danger ; and if the Georgium Sidus, or new planet,
had not
under-
of BONAPARTE. 105
undertaken to kill this new and mighty Emperor oj France I am persuaded
he would not have known how to have framed his judgment. Indeed, it
seems to me, from the opinion of the Author, that Bonaparte must De a
strange “ little great man /” And I am wholly at a loss to discover why the
old stars should prove so partial to the Despot as not to do him injury, for
I am certain they have killed millions ! But Bonaparte seems to be out of
the reach of their power and influence ! Indeed it seems Mars is good-natured
by being in aspect with the henevolents,
and therefore will not step forward
to give him either sickness or death ;
and as to Saturn, it appears that he
“ over-rules danger and consequently will not give the native his quietus f
But when the Georgium Sidus peeps forward, at the head of the murdering
train, then poor Bonaparte must die, if you believe the Author, though he
is much further from the native than Saturn, yet a view of him through a
telescope will perhaps make him surly and ill-natured, and therefore it
would be in vain to attempt to counteract or oppose his baneful influence
indeed it seems there is as much partiality among the stars above, as there
is among us mortals below ! —In fine, I am weary with observing the impro-
babilities given by the Professor, therefore lay by all such simple and con-
fused notions, or else defend them, and I will appear against you in the cause.
From what has been premised, it is easy to discover how greatly the
Author is disposed to countenance all the ignominious deeds of this merciless
Tyrant ! But I humbly conceive the thinking part of the community will not
be duped through his absurd folly and deception.—We may, therefore, in the
most glaring colors, behold the premeditated plans and schemes of the
Despot, displayed for the purpose of procuring the destruction of many ; but,
alas! it is out of the limits of his feeble power to mitigate the fury of the
impending storm that hangs over him ! His pride and insolence is certainly

beyond the bounds of description ; and being successful in several enterprises,
iie seems to flatter himself that he is still able to extend his territories by cruel
and wasteful war, but in this he will be greatly deceived in the end,
though
success may attend his army for a time. And though the Author informs
us, that the sextile of Jupiter and Saturn is likely to be productive of peace
and tranquillity, yet I can by no means believe the assertion, as those celes-
tial bodies are not the representatives of either England or France. But these
circumstances I may probably attend to in a future publication, which lam
now preparing for the press.
Blessed, for ever, be the Name of the ALMIGHTY JEHOVAH, who
ruleth over all HIS WORKS ; and who yet holds out to us, his unworthy
People, many great and wonderful tokens,
by his Celestial Messengers, of
several important events yet to come ;
which, in the end, will be productive of
the greatest RICHES and HONOR to the BRITISH ISLES. The pre-
ceding Positions and subsequent Configurations of the Heavenly Bodies, are
of such importance, that were I to publish the great events portended by them,
I am convinced very few would give credit to my judgment. But the
ARM op the ALMIGHTY will protect us, by whose DIVINE POWER
and ORDINANCE GREAT-BRITAIN will reign TRIUMPHANT at
the conclusion of the Contest, and awe with terror her Tyrannical Enemies;
she will also display her superior Strength, and become a Mediator between
all the opposing and contending Powers; restoring Tranquillity and
Prosperity to her ALLIES ; then will the terrific sound of Guns and
Trumpets be no more heard, and the WORLD shall rest in PEACE.
TO GOD ALONE BE THE PRAISE.
