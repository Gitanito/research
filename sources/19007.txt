consciousness this Faculty of being
sentient awake is not limited to our
brainwaves or our bodies but in fact
transcends the limits of space time is
an unbounded field of awareness and that
is true whether you recognize it or not
interestingly doesn&#39;t matter if you
intellectualize it that is the reality
of it that has been proven through
scientific studies such as dr. John&#39;s
work at Princeton where they would have
people put their awareness on a random
number generator that&#39;s spitting out
zeros and ones randomly and would intend
a shift it&#39;s a towards zeros and they
would shift without any linear wires
just their thought essentially what a
random number generator does it looks at
something intrinsically random in the
physical world typically a quantum
process and it converts those into a
string of ones and zeros so you can
think of it kind of like a coin flipper
where heads is one and tails to zero now
if you collect a large enough sample
size you find a 50-50 distribution of
these ones and zeros meaning physical
reality is behaving the way it should
well if you get somebody in front of the
machine and you ask them to use their
intention to mean shift to thing two
more ones or more zeroes what you find
is that there&#39;s not all the time that
often is a significant mean shift in the
direction of their attention now that&#39;s
a very simple experiment but the
implications are absolutely profound
consciousness may not be localized to
our bodies but may be a fundamental
feature of the physical world
