YOURMIND
AND ITS
MYSTERIES
by EDWIN J. DINGLE
Founder of the Science of Mentalphysics
THE INSTITUTE OF MENTALPHYSICS
P. O. BOX 640, YOCCA V A L L E Y , CA 92284?
The Science of Mentalphysics was founded by Edwin John
Dingle, himself a true Mystic of the Great Wisdom. Raised in
England and educated in publishing, he spent 21 years in the
Orient, where he built a large publishing company with offices
in Shanghai and Hong Kong. He became the leading economic
and geographic authority on China. Details of his distinguish­
ed achievements are related in his books, “ Across China on
Foot” and “ Borderlands of Eternity.”
Always within him burned the constant desire for deeper
wisdom and he studied all religions and mystic knowledge he
found through teachers in the East. His travels led him to a
Tibetan monastery, where he was privileged to study under a
remarkable Tibetan teacher, a keeper of the Eternal Wisdom.
With the deep knowledge he acquired in years of arduous
study, Rev. Dingle (given the Chinese name of Ding Le Mei)
formulated the Science of Mentalphysics, which reveals the
basic truths that underlie all great religions and philosophies
of both the East and the West. Mentalphysics shows the unity
between all great Spiritual Teachings and their ultimate har­
mony with Science. Through the spiritual rebirth of every
individual lies the way to spiritual rebirth of every nation and
positive peace throughout the world.

YOUR MIND AND ITS
MYSTERIES
O F the making of books dealing with the subject of Man and
his Mind there literally is no end. The libraries overflow
with literature from the hands of learned men showing that
human beings are actually the sum total of their thinking; yet, if
you ask the man-in-the-street “What do you think — and why?”
or “ How do you think?” he will scarcely be able to grasp the
meaning of your questions. Man generally is utterly ignorant of
the processes of his own mind. At the same time all philosophers,
occultists, scientists and metaphysicians, teachers and writers,
through all the ramifications of their spoken and written word,
confirm the sublime truth so beautifully enunciated in The Book
that “ as a man THINKETH, so IS he.”
The trouble with most of the learned disquisitions on the
mysteries of man’s mind is that they leave us cold.
The mysteries become more mysterious. We are not shown the
way to unfold them. Most men, however, seem instinctively to
feel that deep down within themselves there are forces which, if
unleashed, would revolutionize their lives. Men believe that they
have powers inherent within them that will enable them to reach
heights of achievement far greater than they have so far reached,
that the human in them is united with the Divine, and in
desperation they are crying “Show us the road! We believe all
that you tell us, but show us the way to unfold the powers of our
m inds. ”
In this little booklet, therefore — which is written with the
fervent hope that it may fall into the hands of those who want to
rise beyond the present conception of their own powders — I shall
endeavor to point out the road. In my teaching I am not so much
interested in telling what the thing is as in trying to show “howto
do it.” Readers will thus find in this little booklet a practical
means by which they may unfold the mysteries of their own
3
minds . . . and so march more confidently along to an under­
standing of that immortal sentence — “as a man thinketh, so is
he. ”
(a) “ The Different” Minds.
Most psychologists declare that there are three minds —
namely, the Superconscious, the Conscious and the Sub­
conscious. With the Superconscious mind, we shall have little to
do here, for the reason that not until we understand the working
of the other supposedly “different” forms of mind can we gain
any understanding of the Superconscious.
We shall, then, deal with TWO forms of mind.
When we say that there are TWO minds, however, we do so for
the purpose of clear thinking. There is only ONE MIND, but
separate functions of the One. Many of the most important
controversies of psychology center in the question of the nature
and extent of the activity involved in consciousness. The
Subconscious mind is comparatively a modern discovery of
science, although it has been known under other names in the
occult schools for ages. Man seemingly has two minds, or two
distinct phases of consciousness. They are: —
(1) . The CONSCIOUS (or “Waking”) Mind. — This is usually
called the Objective Mind. It seems to be the result of external
stimuli to organized brain cells in the cortex of the brain directed
by incoming or AFFERENT sensory impressions. When you
“sleep,” it sleeps. The Conscious Mind seems to be the analyzer,
the comparer, the reasoner, and it acts as a sentinel or watchman
at the doorway to the Subconscious Mind. The Conscious Mind
reasons from cause of effect. The Conscious Mind is the man at
the wheel, the captain on the bridge, the general in the field.
(2) . The SUBCONSCIOUS (or “ Unconscious” or
“Subliminal”) Mind. — This is usually called the Subjective
Mind. It is present before birth. Though for long scientists said
that this Subconscious Mind resided in the Cerebellum and
Medulla Oblongata, it is now generally conceded that it occupies
the whole human body. It would seem to be the living, immortal
part of man. Unlike the Conscious Mind, the Subconscious never
sleeps — it never forgets — its memory is faultless. The
Subconscious builds the body. THINK what a power that is, to
build the greatest and most wonderful machine the world has
ever seen, more wonderful than the imagination of man can even
imagine. It keeps the body working — controls breathing,
circulation of the blood, and all involuntary muscles when you
are asleep as well as when you are awake. It is your Sublime
POWER, amenable to control by the force of suggestion and by
conscious direction (and much more that we shall now learn).
4
(b) The Great Subconscious.
Now, you reason with your Conscious Mind.
Because you see footprints in the wet sand on the beach your
experience tells you that someone has walked that way. But
when you stay to enquire whether those footprints are those of
man or woman, boy or girl, then you are using your reason — the
faculty to consider evidence and form a judgment. We then say
that you are using your Conscious Mind, for you are conscious of
those facts.
With the Subconscious Mind it is quite different. The Sub­
conscious Mind has NO FACULTY OF REASON OR
JUDGMENT. Therefore, the Conscious Mind has to decide for
it, but the SUBCONSCIOUS MIND HAS ALL THE POWER
TO DO WHATEVER IT IS DIRECTED BY THE CONSCIOUS
MIND.
IMPORTANT. — The bearing of this upon our subject is of
the utmost importance. It will readily be seen that whatever the
Conscious Mind accepts and decides upon as true, the Sub­
conscious Mind automatically accepts as true without judgment.
Do not fail to remember this point.
(c) Impressing the Subconscious M ind.*
In a state of hypnosis the Conscious Mind is in abeyance, or, as
it is said, in the hypnotic sleep. While he is hypnotized, you may
give the subject hypnotized a tallow candle, telling him that it is
a stick of candy, and he will eat the tallow, thinking that it really
IS candy. Ask him whether it is sweet, and he will answer that it
is, for he believes it, as the Subconscious Mind accepts what you
say as the truth.
Whether in a state of hypnosis or out of it makes no difference;
the only difference is that in the hypnotic sleep the RESULT is
more apparent.
The Conscious Mind is like the captain on the bridge of his
steamer; he directs its operations. He (or his substitute) must be
there all the time while the steamer is at sea — what for? To
direct the power that drives the ship along — which is analogous
to the Subconscious. Down in the hold of the ship there is a
power driving the ship through the water; this is like the
Subconscious Mind in you and me.
*The reader is advised to procure a Mentalphysics booklet on “How to
Meditate,” which will be of invaluable service in learning how to impress the
Subconscious Mind.
5
It does the work, provides the energy, the force, that keeps the
mechanism of the body at work 24 hours every day for 365 days
every year, and for 60, 70, 80, 100 years or more without a rest,
NEVER PAUSING or taking a holiday.
When it DOES stop, IT DOES SO IN CONSEQUENCE OF
REASONS THAT CAN BE KNOWN, CONTROLLED and
AVOIDED.
The Subconscious Mind starts upon its career of building a
human body at conception. Before this it existed in the sper­
matozoa of the father and the ovum of the mother, and these, in
the last analysis, are units of electric energy. In the final analysis
ALL matter is electric energy.*
(d) The Conscious Mind and the Body.
The CONSCIOUS Mind grows very slowly, and only when the
Subconscious Mind has built the body — and then not for
several years — does it develop power to exercise the faculty of
judgment. During the early years the Subconscious Mind goes on
with the work of construction with very little interference from
the Conscious Mind — it builds a perfect human form (the word
“perfect” is not used in its esthetic sense, for that is a matter of
personal opinion). The point is that all the organs are perfectly
formed in principle for USES they have to perform. The heart
and circulation are so perfect that the brain of Man can conceive
of nothing MORE perfect or superior.
But this remark applies to all the organs — in fact, to the
entire body.
Can anything be imagined more beautiful in its principle than
the eye? Think of the wonder of your skin, with its millions of
pores, its capillaries and its network of fine nerves. THEN
STAND IN REVERENT WONDER AT THE WISDOM PENT
UP IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND that has created and then
sustained this marvellous mechanism.
One could write on and on. One stands in the very
PRESENCE. But what I want to do here is to make perfectly
clear to the reader, so that he may never forget, that the
INFINITE WISDOM, the CREATIVE SPIRIT, ACTING
‘ NOTE — At the instant of conception the Negative and the Positive Poles are
attracted, meet, combine, and from that instant the great Subconscious Mind
takes charge, and goes to work very deliberately and confidently, for it knows its
work, to build a human body. (It would be well for the student to go to a library
and followthis great work during the pre-natal period, for there is much to learn
from it, and you will be made to stand in reverence before this great power).
6
THROUGH THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, KNOWS NOT
ONLY WHAT TO DO WITH EXACTITUDE, BUT HOW AND
WHERE to do, and TO MAINTAIN THE DOING as long as we
live. For think! In the human machine — that marvellous temple
of the Living God, there is a power that built the body (the cells)
and stays with it all the time,, and goes on with the work of
construction and repair 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and
every year.
(e) We Are Not Created in the Human M atrix.
An important error that most of us have to correct is that of
thinking that we were created in the human matrix. Now, that is
only partly true. It is true that the foundation is laid there, fpr
the babe is a mature embryo, not a Man; the Subconscious Mind
has laid this foundation whereon to build the human being. The
work of building is going on all the time, to bring into existence a
Perfect Human Being, the PERFECT WISDOM which is its
source being used to perform its perfect work IF WE WILL
ALLOW IT AND NOT INTERFERE.
Interference starts, however, in nine cases out of ten, with the
£’pnseious Mind, of the parents and those most near to the child,
impressing its Subconscious Mind with the ideas, habits, and
traditions of the Conscious Mind of the family and the race. In
short, the interference is from the Race Mind.
Now, we have seen how easy it is to impress our thought upon
the Subconscious Mind, for WHATEVER WE TELL IT, IT
BELIEVES, HAVING NO FACULTY OF REASON. Do you not
see, therefore, this great factor in our lives: That the
CONSCIOUS Mind can just as easily direct the Subconscious
Mind into CONSTRUCTIVE CHANNELS as into destructive
ones?
(f) M atter of Scientific Direction.
Read over again carefully the last sentence — “That the
Conscious Mind can just as easily direct the Subconscious Mind
into constructive channels as into destructive ones.”
Here lies the crux of all human success and happiness.
Scientific direction of your Subconscious Mind. This writer
truthfully can say that he has never met anything so simple to do
— when you know the way. Anyone can learn the way. Many of
my students, when first coming to me — because of deep-rooted
inferiority complex or a hundred other causes — have feared that
the vistas which a conception of Mentalphysics spreads out
before them were too good to be true. Many, indeed, admitted
that they had for years been studying and had not succeeded —
7
yet in less than a month in Mentalphysics they so revolutionized
their lives as to be amazed at the inherent power of their own
minds.
It may be the same with YOU, dear reader. If so, I pray you
thoughtfully to read on. You may be on the verge of discovering
something of immeasurable value to you in gaining perfect
health, success, permanent happiness — in short, you may
literally be opening the door to your Kingdom of Happiness.
(g) The Laws of the Universe.
THINK as you read. The Laws of Life are Health, Strength,
Wisdom, Beauty, Power, Energy, and so forth. These laws are
also Eternal. Inasmuch as all the principles are resident in the
Subconscious Mind as the result of its conjunction, so to speak,
with the Creative Spirit — the God within us — it follows that
we are only voicing the truth about ourselves in making these
statements.
(h) Power of Mentalphysics.
The surest and safest manner in which the Subconscious Mind
may be impressed into obedience to the Laws of Life is through
Mentalphysics. This may be undertaken by any individual, no
matter what his “education.” Students in Mentalphysics declare
that the system which I teach assures the beginner as well as the
advanced student perfect success. (I know this to be true, and, if
the reader be ready for the Higher Teaching, I would strongly
advise him or her to seek further information as to what is
possible through Mentalphysics, though I must add that unless
the student is ready for the unfoldment of the Law, and anxious
to get out of the rut of the past, no outside power will bring help).
We know that the Subconscious Mind believes what it is told
without question, and it immediately sets to work to build the
Temple according to the principles that you have claimed for it.
And no matter what your direction may be, the result is bound to
materialize, for the Subconscious Mind accepts without question
what you tell it.
And then what happens?
As the new and beautifully true ideas of success, of health, of
power, of joy, of harmony — become part of your new con­
sciousness, the erroneous and false ideas fade away into obscuri­
ty — they are expelled by the new ideas.
When you are no longer conscious of evil, for you evil does not
exist.
When you are no longer conscious of poverty, for you there is
none.
8
When you are no longer conscious of fear, it slips out of your
mind.
In this manner you become free of the conditions you have set
out to overcome.
(i) A Study of Our Emotional Life.
Insofar as the body is a machine, most of its work is carried on
involuntarily — that is, w'e have no conscious control over it.
What I mean is that we do not CONSCIOUSLY control the
circulation of the blood. Indeed, few of us know anything about
the work of the blood, and still less about the corpuscles and the
liquid in which, like fish, they “swim.” Still less do most of us
know about the m odus operandi involved not only in the
building of the body, but in its marvellous maintenance.
Nor need we dwell long upon it. We may dismiss it by stating
that all this work is carried out by the Subconscious Mind.
The BREATHING is as involuntary as the circulation, until
we THINK about it, and then it seems to pass from the
Subconscious Mind to the Conscious Mind for the time that we
are thinking about it. (Students of Mentalphysics are learning
more about their Breath than any other body of students in this
country at the present time, and they know that breathing is
peculiarly intermingled with the emotional life, which we are
now considering and endeavoring to understand.)
While we do not CONSCIOUSLY have much to do with all
this work, still we DO influence the work UNCONSCIOUSLY
BY THE EMOTIONS. The emotions are closely related to the
thoughts: in fact, they RISE OUT OF THE THOUGHTS, and
thus, whether we know it or not, we are playing upon the human
instrument ALL THE TIME. The emotions all affect the body
for good or ill. For example, w'e all know how the heart beats
faster when we are excited — we get hot in shame, cold in terror,
and so on. Yet WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS that our Emotions
are affecting this “Temple of the Living God” every moment
that we live.
Is it not obvious, then, that we ought to see to it that we
THINK RIGHT in order that our Emotions may operate in a
constructive manner instead of the reverse? Remember the
truth: “As a man thinketh, so is he.”
Watch a man’s Emotions, and you will find that his success in
life is the correct measure of his emotions.
(j) Emotions Are the Feelings of the Soul.
The Emotions are the feelings of the Soul, fluctuating from one
state of the affections to another, for they change from hour to
9
hour, even from moment to moment — look at the changes of
Emotions that we go through when we watch a thrilling movie,
for example, or when we listen to fine music. But an Emotion
that we cherish GETS FIXED, and when it is deeply rooted we
call if a MOOD, and these moods become so firmly rooted in the
M ind that we GROW UNCONSCIOUS OF TH EIR
EXISTENCE. But because we do not know they are there DOES
NOT PREVENT THEM FROM AFFECTING US.
The Emotions move in two directions, having, like the
Magnet, a Positive and a Negative pole.
The Positive is that ofATTRACTION — or Love.
The Negative is that of REPULSION — or Hate.
But just as a ray of light may be split into primary colors by
the aid of a prism, so the Emotions are divisible almost ad
infinitum . I will quote just- a few of the qualities, of Love, and
invite you thoughtfully to compare them with those of the.
Some ofthe Qualities
ofHATE,
-The Negative.
Ignorance - Vice - Guilt - Feat •
Sorrow - Grief- Worry'- Sadness -
Cowardice -Revenge - Selfishness
- Disease - Doubt - Death. -
Discord - Sensualism - Envy -
etc.
opposites.
Some ofthe Qualities
ofLOVE,
' The Positive.
W isdom --- Know ledge -
Benevolence - Virtue - Innocence
- Fearlessness - Happiness - Joy -"
Peace - Youth- - Faith - Resolu­
tion - Fortitude - Health -
Strength -etc.
(These can be multiplied easily withthe aid ofa Thesaurus),
The above are but a few of the Emotions, and each of them can
be divided and subdivided, as when Fear becomes Anxiety,
Misgiving, Despondency, Gloom, and so on. By a study of the
different human Emotions the student will be able to see how,
WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT, these complex emotions
and affections are playing upon the delicate instrument which he
calls his body all the time.
(k) The Creative Principles.
From a study of the Emotions you will come to the conclusion
that LOVE embodies all the Creative Principles, and that the
Creative Principles are classifiable under the positive element,
LOVE. These principles preserve the body intact.
When you think of it you will find that all the principles known
— to Science, to Architecture, to Engineering, etc. — are based
on this Law of Love. The Principles are in operation everywhere
around us all the time. Principles known to Science are in
10
operation constantly, and underlying the whole material uni­
verse the laws of Beauty, Strength, Order and so on, are the
principles upon which everything rests.
We can use these Creative Principles and USE THEM
CONSTRUCTIVELY if we so desire.
In Mentaiphysics we are taught how to successfully uncover
these Principles from the hidden depths of our own Being into
the Conscious Mind, so that they may be established consciously
in the Conscious Mind. Then we are no longer fooled by the
illusion of the senses, for we shall know who and what we are.
Therefore, the reader is invited to examine himself to discover
his permanent moods. You will be surprised. You will doubtless,
like most people, find that you are dominated by some phase of
FEAR. Of such people we say that they are gloomy, despondent,
serious, apprehensive, worrying, etc., and if such people happen
to be happy, cheerful, joyous, it is a lapse from their permanent
mood. WE HAVE, THEREFORE, TO LEARN THE WAY TO
REVERSE OUR MOODS, so that some aspect of the Love
Emotions dominate — like Cheerfulness, Gladness, Hopefulness.
We shall then declare the truth that we are cultivating a happy
disposition, a Happy Mood.
(1) Co-operate With the Creative Principles.
By this means, thus co-operating with the creative principles,
we eliminate the destruction wrought within us by the dis­
integrating emotions and so automatically attract success.
It is unnecessary for me to point out to you that the Negative
Emotions are DESTRUCTIVE. They cause sickness, senility,
disease, decay, old age, failure, cowardice. So venomous are
these Negative Emotions that the death of an infant has been
traced to poison generated in its mother’s milk by anger. The
perspiration of a human being can be suddenly changed and
charged with venom, and such perspiration, fed to rats, has
caused their death.
When we know the way, however, we preserve the temple of
the body. By consciously co-operating with the principles
existing within us, and establishing them in the Conscious Mind,
by making these principles our permanent moods, we conserve
the life energies. Through Mentaiphysics practices we find that
we can direct them into construction and so avoid the factors of
disintegration.
(m) Eliminate the Mysteries.
It will have been seen that the so-called “mysteries” of man’s
mind cease to be mysteries when we uncover the principles and
11
laws through which our minds work. It is perfectly obvious to the
thinker that every detail of the working of the Universe is
possible to the knowledge of the human mind, in fact, it is
already KNOWN to the Universal Mind; and every human soul
contains, POTENTIALLY, the knowledge of the Universal
Mind.
The laws of the Universe are immovable and fixed — that is
why we call them laws. The human mind works by law — your
mind, my mind, works by law, and cannot work in any other
way. Therefore, when we know the law of our own minds there is
nothing that we cannot do, remembering that the Subconscious
of us — the eternal power within us — will do ANYTHING that
it is properly directed to do by our Conscious Mind. This is good
news indeed. And better news is that in Mentalphysics we may
all learn the way. Mentalphysics puts within our reach the
“ means by which” we may revolutionize our lives, if we sincerely
wish to do so. Mentalphysics seeks to develop practical methods
of application of laws, by study and practice, whereby the
earnest seeker after Truth may obtain the most perfect physical
development, greater length of life, increased mental power,
unfailing happiness, mental and spiritual unfoldment, and an
abiding knowledge of the Art of Living.
Mentalphysics will lead the student step by step away from
weakness and inefficiency and inferiority complexes, away from
inharmony and want, away from unhappiness and discontent
and fear and worry, to personal poise and undreamed-of power,
to joy and wealth and efficiency through an understanding of
evolutionary law. But this high teaching is not for the trifler. The
principles and laws disclosed in Mentalphysics will be worth
nothing to the student unless he or she USES them. But they will
be worth everything — everything to YOU, dear reader, if you
are ready — when you use them as they are disclosed. Students
enthusiastically and gratefully acknowledge that their new
knowledge of these principles and laws of life are worth ninety-
nine per cent of what they have really attained and what they
themselves have become through this beautiful philosophy.
But reading about these principles and laws, these
“ mysteries” of mind, will not in the least help you. It is only by
(a) first learning about them, (b) then using them, and (c) finally
REALIZING them in your life that you can extract from them
their full value.
In concluding, I can but hope that you who read may look
within yourself to make the greatest discovery any man can
make — to discover the eternal fact that “Whatever the Creator
is, I am.”
