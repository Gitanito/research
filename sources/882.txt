  James was a "tramp printer" who settled in Brattleboro, Vermont, where he began to tout himself as "Dickens' Medium."  He published Part Second of the Mystery of Edwin Drood by the Spirit-Pen of Charles Dickens (1874) and started the Summerland Messenger which printed other communications from the spirit of Dickens.  The Religio-Philosophical Journal for January 2, 1875, noted that the journal in December had started a new Dickens' story, "Bockley Wicklesheep," only one segment of which, alas, has survived.  The physical description of the journal is given in George P. Rowell & Co.'s American Newspaper Directory, 1876, which says the journal was begun in 1873.  American Antiquarian Society.
