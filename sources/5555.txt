tte a w itt the scriptures of eternal truth,
and being led, I trusty to see their meoftCfl*

from » Jow tb the truth asit hriit Jesus, to
oppose those errors which have bee# propa­

It is truly lamentable to behold so many
people carried away by such awful doctrine,
and thus to be deluded by the devil, who too
.frequently, as in this case, makes his'appear-
ance as an angel of light, and hides his
cloven foot under an angelic wing, with an
intent to deceive the simple ones.

IV PREFACE.
A desire to set forth truth in its true light,
and to make such palpable errors appear in
their true colours, has been the cause of this
small pamphlet making its Appearance in
public; hoping that those who have embrac-
. ed such heretical opinions, may, upon a dili-
gent inquiry after truth, and comparing her
works and)the following pages with the Word
bf God, be led, through the illumination of
the Holy Spirit; to discover their mistake, to
renounce error, and embrate the glorious gos­
pel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
which alonie is able to make them wise unto
salvation. - - ■

But as the chief design of this work is to oppose the
heresies and false doctrines of Joanna Southcott, the
Exetefe prophetess, 1 now come more immediately to
speak of her and her Wplke,' hdpipg£ hr seme measure,
to expose tht absurdity of her principles, and to prove
that both herself and followers are a company of poor
deluded people, and that unless the Lord is pleased to
extend his mercy to them in a wonderful manner, where
he is they can never come* OtfFprophetess was baptized
at St. Mary Ottery; into what faith 1know not, unless
it is that of devils; for though I know her not personally,
yet I am acquainted with some people who can prove
that she is a lying prophetess, for she prophesied the

some of her blind followers assert, that it is not suffici-;

The characters who are led to .embrace tin* erroneous
system are such as the word of God"represents to be in
darkness and gross ignorance; for the embracing it does
not even so ranch as moralize them; and many of those
who have espoused her cause, and are amongst the most
warm advocates for her diabolical doctrine, are charac­
ters that are a disgrace to the truly enlightened part of
mankind; for while many of them have put their hand­
writing to the destruction of Satan’s empire, and the
establishing Christ’s kingdom in the world; they live in
gross immorality* such as cursing, swearing, and drunk­
enness* and yet trust to Joannas seal for salvation. I
would a*k* Are such ignorant, unenlightened, unsancti­
fied cursers, swearers, and drunkards* fit subjects to
dwell and reign with, the King of kings, and Lord of
lords* when he shall reign in his spiritual kingdom on
'earth?
Again* as some clergymen in the church of England
have espoused this new-fangled doctrine* and are pro­
pagating it in order to shew their obedience to the Lord*
I would enquire* Whether they are dissenters or real
churchmen ? Joanrui'$ followers inform us they are.
churchmen* and that all her advocates are ordered to go
to church* because some churchmen come nearest to her
doctrine, and all of them will ere long. As to the meet*
ings, and especially those of the calvinistic persuasion,
they will all fall to the ground ; for Joanna, in her 3d
book of Wonders, p. 56* poetry, declares that neither.
Calvinists or Arminians are right, nor will they be suf­
fered to rest in glory. This, she would have mankind to
believe, is the ytry voice of Christ himself. But with
respect io those gentleman in the establishment, who
embrace her principles, I conceive they are not church­
men in reality* hut dissenters, not from the walls and
order of the church, but from the pure calvinistic doc­
trines contained in her articles; though at the same time
they 8wear to maintain those very articles which are
founded on the scriptures of eternal truth: but after all
are filled with enmity against the truth contained in those
very articles* and cry tnem down bptfi from the pulpit
and press. Such is the awful blindness of those who
are enlisted under the banner of Joanna, in order to pro­
pagate her diabolical doctrines to the deceiving of many
fho follow her pernicious ways* whereby the way of

who propagate her sendmoots with such* M te’fieiy kfetA,
eon be either sent or taught of God to deceive the igne*
wot io the way and wanner in which they do. Did Sttdi
pretended teachers know by euperience what they atfe ifl
theaidvea, and were made acquainted with Christ and
the power of his resurrection, *they wetildnCt be tarried
away by such delusions as Joanna has asserted fat facts.
Neither cao any of the elect of God who are called ac­
cording to his purpose, sit with any satisfaction Under
such touchers, unless they are very weak in understand*
ing,. and faith likewise: though it may‘be possible fof
some, who are chosen of God frortt eternity, to be car*
vied away for a season with such poisonous doctrine aft
hers is ; yet they will not be suffered to die in the belief
thereof; for Christ told hie diseipies, that if they drank
any deadly thing it should not hurt them; therefore
.such will be given to see their error in embracing those
things that are dishonourable to God and :their pro­
fession, and will be led by his Holy Spirit to bless and!
praise his adorable name for his discriminating mercy
towards them in bringing them back from their wander­
ings, while multitudes are left .to continue under tk#
delusions of the devil. St. Paul says in his 2nd Epistle
to the Tkesaalouians, 2d chapter and If and 12 verses,
And for this souse God shall send them strong detusioni
that they should believe a lie, that they all might bedamned
mho believed net the truth, but had pleasure in unrighte­
ousness* It is therefore plain and evident that many who
have with eagerness embraced this.new system, are so
ignorant of the first principles of real heart-felt religion,
Shat they have scarce the form of k, mud) fess the pow­
er : and If any thing is said to them concerning the expe­
rience of one born of God, and close conversation is
entered into with them on spiritual and divine things, it
n easy to discover that all their knowledge centers in
their heads, that they are full of they know not what,
and are so confident of being right, that they do not
admit of a single doubt to the contrary. An artful de­
lusion indeed, for blind leaders, blind people, and a
lying prophetess to be under; and' it will be well for
them all if they do not sink into the bottomless pit
together.

soft the w «e time ago, and entered into conversa­
tion with him, and in the course of conversation* ad-*
vieed him to implore the divine protection before it
is too late: this she cannot deny. I would ask her
thie question* Do you reatly believe there tea possibility
of saltation for the devil ? If so, Why do yon say in
another book9 that Satan is to bear all our sins ? If you
do not believe in his salvation, why do yon act the hypo-
crite ip desiring him to implore the divine protection
before it be too late ? Reconcile these two extremes if
you can. You likewise exhorted the king of the bottom­
less pit to repent. You say he answered, Do you think
1 would be such, a fool as to repent, even if I could ?
By this it appears that the devil knew more than Joanna
did; he knew he could not repent; he knew he was not
redeemed; for Christ took hot on him the*nature of an­
gels^ but the seed of 'Abraham. If Joanna had been*
tapght by God the Spirit, she would have known that
Christ is exalted a Prince and a Saviour to give repent­
ance to Israel and the remission of sins to his chosen,
who are loved with an everlasting love, and with loving,
kindness are drawn to him: and all the chosen ones' will
find* sooner or later, that Christ, end he alone, is exalted
tp give this blessing to them as the effect of his etefnal.
love towards them. But no stich blessing is reserved for
tkedevjlorariy of thefalleri angels.
On the first*page of sound an alarm Y
nmy hcdy moun­
tain, dated Jbribery 30th, 1804, Joanna says, “ It
would be more fatal for me and all mankind than the
fall of Eve was, if I did not obey.” Who* I atk, would
rriceivfe such doctrine as this is, except they were spiritu­
ally blind indeed? for it paints out to us, that the eter­
nal purposes of God*depend on the obedience of &poor
fallible mortal, and that the whole plan of man’s redemp­
tion dpperidb upon a woman who has the impudence to"
pretend to possess greater wisdom than all the prophets'
and apostles, who were in reality inspired by theViioly;
vGhost to write the Old and* New incitements; which'
sacred books she pretends*to illustrate, and says, every
other explanation, especially by Calvinists* is wrong. A
glorious salvation indeed to depend on, which rests onso

crimes. While such spiritual’fools as Joann*, her clergy*
and people, pretend to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ, they
degrade him, and his great salvation^ to. the lowest de»
See; and those who through grace are enabled by the
oly Spirit to confide in him for a full, free, and com­
plete salvation, without money and without price, as the
free gift of God; such, not believing in Joanna as pos­
sessed of superior wisdom to the prophets and apostles of
our Lor.d, and not having been sealed by her, are said to
be in the gall of bitterness9 and in the bonds of iniquity:
and while Christ reigns on earth, they, as well as the
world of ungodly sinners, will go to hell for a thousand
years; and whep that thousand years are expired, all
will be let out again, and will at last all be saved.
According to this doctritie^ there is no difference,
between those who cau prove from sweet and happy
experience their new and spiritual birth, being hom
again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, hy}
the word of God which liveth anif abideth for ever, X
Pet, i. 23, and the finally impenitent; unless they
believe that Joanna is sent to seal the people to the
day of redemption, and are actually sealed by her;
for this punishment such must undergo, however the
Lord may have made a difference between them and
. the ungodly sinner by the power of his discriminating
grace, to hell they must go, because they do not believe
ip Joanna Southcottf and cannot produce,a paper seal!
But my God and Saviour tells me and all hischosen peo­
ple ip nis sacred word, Whosoever believeth in me hath
everlasting life, and shall not came into condemnation, but
is passedfrom death unto life. This Joanna, and her
blind followers, deny end say, unless wp b$lipve in and
are sealed by Joanna, thpre. is no salvation' for us.
Fjowever I beg legy£ to be ranked amongst those whom
she and hpr deluded brethren are, pleased to term unbe­
lievers, and to ,take the consequence* But J defy
Joannppr apy of her priests to curse any spul whom
God has blessed with the knowledge of salvation by the
remission of their sips* through the atoning blood of
Jesus (jhrist, the pne mediator between God and man,
who was set up from everlasting as the Representative
and alone surety of all his poop)?; who, as the gre&t

1 know that the doctrine the apostle Paal preached,
and was led by the Holy Spirit to write, is very dis­
gusting to Joanna and her followers ; and that those who
are led to embrace and earnestly contend for the doc­
trines contained in Paul's Epistles are said to know
nothing at all by those who make Joanna's books the *
rule of their faith; and who tell us, that more is revealed
to her, than is revealed to the prophets and apostfes in
the'Old and New Testament: but let us now tty the spi­
rits, according to the apostle John’s direction in his 6rst
JLpistle, and 4th chapter, Beloved, believe not everyspirit,
but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many
false prophets are gone out into the ttorId. Now, how'
shall we know the false spirit from the spirit of truth,
but by tracing their different operations, tmd proving
that each spirit prodncwib its own effects. We w i first
b^gin with that spirit which causeth Joanna's followers
to believe in her pretended mission; this spirit brings
almost immediately on believing in Joanna, and receiv­
ing her paper seal, such extacy of joy and consolation
in the mind, as the receiver thereof never found before;
whilst, at the same time, they are addicted to make use
of the most profane language and intemperance, such
as cursing, swearing, drunkenness, &c. and also begets
that strong and uuscriptural confidence in tbe person
thus sealed, which produces a false peace, that they m-
mediately conclude they are right, and in a fair way fo*
the kingdom of heaven. Hence they imagine the Prince^
of Darkness is never ihore to molest or disquiet them by
any temptation, upon pain of receiving a greater punish­
ment, as has already been hinted at: neither, indeed,
has he any occasion so to do, because he has already the
possession of the castle, (or heart) as his chief residence;
for a stronger than himself is not yet entered, to bind
the strong man, cast him out, and take his dwelling:
for was this the case with them, they would be delivered
from this refuse of lies, and would be glad to run to a
llock for shelter instead of a piece of paper, which wilt
not screen them from tbe storm that will one day over­
take them; and living and dying in this state it is to be
feaied that such will never be inhabitants of the Netf
Jerusalem church above: neither’can they, in reality,
tfesire to enter into the heavenly kingdom, while they
continue strangers to the regenerating influence of the
Holy Spirit, whose work and divine operation I shall

now attempt to describe, and hope to 6how, by the
. touchstone of eternal truth, the difference between the
spirit of truth* and the spirit of error. But before I
proceed, 1 would, for a moment, take notice of Joanna's
explanation of the 3d chapter of John, 3d verse to the
7tn, in her Third Book of Wonders, page 13, which is
as follows; viz. “ Had my sayings been understood that
a second child should be born of my spirit, then impos­
ters would have arisen; neither could I have asked Ni«
codemus how he, being a master of Israel, knew not
these things. He could have no knowledge from my
gospel. 1 spoke concerning the prophets, that he might
understand how I came first to die for man ; but to fulfil
them in the end. It is. in spirit that the spiritual child
must be born again. These things stand on record, but
not understood by men.” Is this the'genuine meaning
of this precious part of God's word, in which thousands,
and probably millions, of the elect vessels of mercy bare
been enabled to rejoice in their fulfilment ? Certainly
not. But to return to my subject, and in order to
explain the aforementioned passage, agreeably to the
Old and New Testaments, and the experience of every
believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall, as I before
said, attempt to describe the operation of the Holy
Spirit upon the heart of an elect sinner* in order to make
him meet for the inheritance of the saints in light*
This blessed Spirit is a Spirit of Truth, and not of
error, and as he was promised to lead the people of
God iuto all truth, and to deliver them from every fa’se
way; so when he undertakes to teach aud instruct the
sinner who is the object of eternal love, he always does
it consistently with that word which was written by holy
men of old as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
And in order to produce a new and spiritual birth in the
soul, he first gives life to feel their wretchedness and mi*
st*ry by nature, and light to see themselves as naturally
dead, dumb, blind, deaf, and naked; and not only so,
but that they are insensible thereof, until this divine
Agent breathes into them the breath of life; and then
instead of a delusive joy and consolation at first (as is
produced by the spirit of error) the soul is awakened to
feel and see its lost state by nature and practice, that he
has broken the Jaw of God, and that he stands con­
demned by it; and without an interest in the Lord Jesus

Christ (not in Joanna and her paper seals) he must pe­
rish for ever. Hence he experimentally feels his spiritual
wants and necessities, and is led by the Holy Spirit, who
implanted the cry in his heart, to sue for mercy feelingly,
not formally and with the lips only ; and that God who
hears and answers prayer, is pleased in his own time,
way, and manner, to remove the guilt of sin from hb
conscience; and instead of those doubts, fears, and
awful apprehensions, which arise from a spirit of bon­
dage, that peace which passeth all understanding, and
a divine tranquility, is enjoyed in the soul. As the
cause of this experience is the eternal love of God; so
the effects which are produced give an evident testimony
that God the Spirit is the divine agent: for he first
makes the sinner cry out as Paul, the jailor, or the pub­
lican did, with a What must I do to be saved ? which
arises from a sense of sin : and afterwards those painful
sensations are taken away by the same almighty power,
and a sweet sense of the love of God is shea abroad in
the heart by the Holy Ghost, which begets deep humi­
lity and gratitude of heart; and enables the soul, thus '
born again, to say with David, What shall I render unto
the Lord for all his benefits bestowed upon me. All
this is known experimentally by the soul that is brought
by the Spirit of Truth to realize that precious portion Of
scripture which Joanna has so awfully perverted to her
own base and deceiving purposes, by endeavouring to
make her deluded followers view it in the light that she
puts upon it; which is nothing but darkness itself, when
.contrasted with the true import of the passage which
was spoken by the Redeemer of elect sinners to Nicode-
m us: and he being one of that happy number, was
brought by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, to know and
enjoy his own personal interest in the sweet doctrine
which those words contain. He well knew, after that
his understanding was enlightened, his will was renewed,
and his affections were spiritualized, the fulfilment of
numbers of Old Testament passages, being realized in his
own experience; the beauty of which cbuld never be
.seen by the faith of God’s elect, or any sweetness
drawn therefrom, by reason of the spiritual darkness
that pervaded their minds, and the mind of all man­
kind, whilst in an unrenewed state.

specting Joanna and her doctrine, that she is a stranger
to the new and spiritual birth, mentioned by our Lord
to Nicodemus; and though she may pretend to a spirit
of prophesy, and seal hundreds of her deluded disci­
ples with her signature, and by so doing grant them a
passport to the heavenly kingdom; yet I. would have
her recollect,, that if she and her followers die ignorant
of this important change, damnation will be the lot of
her and them. Although she stiles her adherents,
*Believers/* yet the word of the living God is positively
against all such as are not born again by this incorrupti­
ble seed; and it is as impossible that they can have any
knowledge of, or relish for spiritual things in a spiritual
manner, as that a man literally dead., can enjoy the
good things of this life. Many of her believers have set
their names to the destruction of Satan’s kingdom, while
in heart and life they deny that ever any such desire was
given them; and this is a fact which none who knows
them will ever deny; for many of them are as ignorant
of the true gospel of the ever blessed Redeemer as an
unenlightened hottentot.
These things l lay before the public, that they may
see whether her explanation of the aforesaid passages
will harmonize or agree with other passages in the old
and New Testaments which might very easily be quoted;
but as I do not intend to swell this pamphlet to a size
which it might be difficult for the poorer class in society
to purchase* V shall forbear to particularize them; but
at the same time intreat ray readers to examine the
Word of God for themselves, as it abounds with proof
upon proof pf the truth of the doctrine 1 contend for;
but there is not pne word from the beginning of Genesis
to »the end of the Revelations, that informs us that
Jesus Christ is to have a 6on, which son, we are told,
Joanna is to bring into,the world by the power of the
Mpst High, a**fwho, she declares, is to be the comfor­

ppm promise; and in order to make us believe what she
has written, has quoted the words of our blessed Lord
himself, in the loth chapter of John’s gospel, the 7th

prone the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of
judgment. This passage she would have Jew and Gen­
tile to believe has an immediate reference, and actually
applies to this child she is now pregnant with, and
which she is shortly to bring into the world; and whom
she, in her Third Book of Wonders, page SI, calls
the -Prince of Peace: in page 22, the Saviour of the
Jews; and in page 25, the Restorer of them to their
own land. In page 26, she tells us, that Christ spake
concerning the Son that should be revealed at his second
coming, and in page 27, that if the words of Christ had
been understood, which he spake to Nicodemus, it
would hd\e been clearly understood that there would he
a second Son, like the first.
From the preceding lines it is plain, that Joanna has
most awfully perverted this precious portion of God's
most holy word, for throughout the whote of the sacred
Writings there is not the most distant idea given that
the Third Person in the adorable Trinity, called the
“ Comforter,” is any where said to be born of a woman.
W hat! a pure spirit to become* according to her gross
conceptions, flesh and blood; and to be called the
Prince of Peace, and the Saviour of the Jews!! Awful
blasphemy indeed,
Before I proceed any further, I would ask Joanna, or
any of her followers, this question: Did the j£ws do
right to reject the Lord Jesus Christ as their Prophet*
Priest, King, Prince, and Saviour ; or, was it wrong in
them when Christ told them, You will not come to mt,
that ye might have Ufe, to refuse to come to him for life
and salvation 1 Is there two Saviours provided, one for
the Jews, and another for the Gentiles ? If she and they
answer as her works declare, they must say there is, for
it is manifest she has attempted to prove-it in them:
but if her works are true, the Bible is false; because
those absurdities and falsehoods would follow, which,
prove that her books and thfe sacred Scriptures by no.
means harmonize and agree ; and this 1 shall endeavour
to proveto every unprejudiced mind.
She tells us that her son, which is shortly to be born*
is actually the Shiloh, or Messiah of the Jews. We

O
she nas declared: out the consequence which follows
such an errpneous idea is, that those who rejected the
tjrue Messiah when he made his appearance upon this,
earth were right in so doing, which will appear from the
following remark. When Jesus told the Jews they,
would not come to him that they? might have life, it
' would have been wisdom in them to reject him, apd to
have told him, you have promised us life in our coroingtQ
you,hut how can you give us the Life you speak of, when
you are npt our Shiloh or Messiah? Our Shiloh which
we look for, h to born of Joanna Southcott, who will
be a native of England, but her birth will not take
place until near eighteen hundred years have revolved
round; therefore we shall despise and reject you as an
imposter*
Again, if her books are right, Old Simeon was wrong
when he took our Saviour iu his arms and embraced
him, and said, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart
in peace, according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen
thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face
qf aU people; a light to to lighten the Gentiles, and to
he the glory of thy people Israel. Observe, he was to bp
the glory of Israel, but what a mistaken man must good
old Simeon be, to embrace our Saviour as the true Mes-
jsiah,,. when the Shiloh promised, was to be bbrn of our
wonderful prophetess, Joanna Southcott.
Again, when John seat two of his disciples Ur Jesus
to enquire of him whether, it wad he that should come,
Or whether they were to Look fur another; Jesus answer­
ed, and said unto them, Go, and shew John these things
which you do hear and see, The blind receive their sight,
th^ lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
.dead arc raised up, and the poor have the gospelpreached
unto them* Matthew, chap. xi. 3, 4, and 5th verses.
Further, when John's disciples asked this question,
Whether it was he or another they were to look for,
.Christ immediately referred them, to the miracles that.he
wrought in their presence, as a full proof that he himself
was the only true Shiloh that was to come; for if there
had been another to have arisen, Christ would have told

according to Joanna's system, which she teljs us is frorq
the Spirit of the living God, there are two Shilovs of
Messiahs; one for the Jews, and another for the Gen*

sealed with her seal, are, as she says, protected by thf
Lord; but if they break them they lpose the Lords

Again, on the day of Pentecost, when our,Lord’s
disciples were aaet together, waiting far the promised
Comforter, the Ejfoly Spirit, when they felt his divine,
quickening, and comforting influence on their hearts,
Peter's mouth and heart wap opened tp speak of the
Savipur of the Gentiles; hut the audience that Peter
addressed at that time were professing Jews from all
parts of the known world; and that blessed gospel
which Peter was enabled hy the power of the Holy Spir
rit to preach, was blest at that time to no less than three
thousand souls. Now, if Joannas Writings are dictated
by the Spirit of God, and that the true Shiloh is not

.whom she says she is pregnant with, how gan the writings
of the Old and New Testament be correct ? For if her

Jews, by and through the Saviour of elect sinners, led
them all into a delusion, by causing them to embrace a

22 REMARKS ON THE WRITINGS
Neither is thtre salvation in any other; for there is no
other name under heaven given among men whereby we
must be saved. If Joanna considers that little^ but sig­
nificant pronoun we, in the foregoing passage I have
auoted from the Acts, which indudes Jews and Gen­
tiles, and if there is no other name under heaven given
among men, but that of the Lord Jesus Christ, aSr
Peter under divine inspiiation tells us, to obtain life
and salvation by, 1 hope she will discover that it
will be in vain for the Jews to look to that Shiloh and1
Prince of Peace which is to be born and suckled*
by her.
The apostle Paul, in his writings to the church a€
Ephesus, tells the believing Ephesians in the second
chapter and 14 verse, that Christ is their *€peace:’*
For he is our peace who hath mads both one, and hath
broken down the middle wall of partition between us;
that is, believing Jews and believing Gentile* ate made
by the power of divine grace, one spirit in the Lord;
and sure 1 am they will unite together in owning sal*
ration by one Shiloh, who hath loved them9 and wash•
td them from their sins in his own blood• It will
not be the Messiah of the Gentiles begetting the Jews'
Messiah, and each party praising a different Saviour;
no! no I there is no such inconsistent work among the
true worshippers of the only living and true God.
Joanna appears in her writings to be erecting a thick
wail of partition agaiu, which Paul tells us is broken
-down, and therefore all her daubing is with untempered
•mortar, and will ever appear so in the eyes of all genuine
believers in the Three-One Jehovah, whom she in her
writings thinks to honour, though in reality degrades in
a monstrous and blasphemous manner indeed; which
makes me bold to tell her, in plain language, that her
works are a jumble of inconsistent phrases altogether,
as ever were wrote by mortal man, and are fit for nothing
but to be burnt in a public market; and I am persuaded
all firm believers iu the Scriptures of eternal truth will
acknowledge the same. She perhaps will say* that her
followers believe in the Bible, or else they would not be
*60 ready to believe in her writing?, which give the real
meaning and true explanation thereof. This I very
much doubt; for 1 firmly believe that f,e nelf, and most
Digitized by Google
of her deluded rfollowers, know not wbat it is to be a
Bible Christian; because their hearts are ao full of enmity
against the sovereignty of the eternal Jehovah in the
choice of his people» m electing them to eternal life in
Christ Jesus, from before the foundation of the world.
This doctrine of eternal election was preached by our
Lord Jesus Christ himself, as .well as by his apostles,;
and therefore she and her followers may, if they please,
despise it and say, that the doctrine of predestination
and election came from the devil, and at the same time
call themselves believers in tbe Bible; but it only mani­
fests their enmity of heart against tjie deep troths so
clearly revealed in the word of eternal truth, and the
darkness of their understandings in the sacned science of
Christianity.
It is the peculiar privilege of the elect of God to be
truly taught by the Holy Spirit, and to be led to embrace
the.whole of tne gospel in its sacked connexion and har­
mony. Thus possessing a knowledge of the truth in
thehr understandings, and feelij^ its quickening influ­
ence on their hearts, they are preser^e&^Kgn embracing
such detestable errors as are now brqacbew^n the world
.by those who call themselves the seal&'ofthe Lord, and
tne elect, (when, at the same time, they know- not God
by regenerating grace) making the i ^ o ^ ^ believe,
because they have her seal, called “ The^haT of the
Lord/’ that they, are thereby elected to etfermil ljfe;
when they are. as destitute of any meetness for the'enjoy­
ment and, employment of the eelestrai world, and unfit
to hold communion with Father, Son, and Spirit, as the
Prince of Darkness himself. Nevertheless Joanna styles
them, Believers! to inherit die tree of life, though capa- '
ble, by breaking her seal, to make their election to etev*
nal life null *ead void: so that if all the sealed of the
Lord, socalled, were to break their seals, Christ would
be a king without having any subjects in his kingdom,
either to rule in or reign ever.
Now supposing for a few moments that some of the
sealed, and some amongst them whose names 1 know,
should be taken out of the world whilst they continue to
curse and swear iq this awful manner they do, can their
belief in her mission being of God, and having a paper

14 REMARKS ON THE WRITINGS
Lord, that they are the elect; and that th£y are to
inherit the tree of life? It cannot be; for if they
were admitted into the heavenly Canaan, what would
they do there? Would their saying that they had
signed their names for the destruction of Satan's king­
dom, and that they believed in Joanna the prophetess,
and had one of her seals, be sufficient to introduce them
into the full enjoyment of the King of kings, and Lord
of lord*, to dwell forever in his blissful presence, where
is fulness of joy, and at whose right-hand are pleasures
for evermore ? Certainly not; they are not qualified for
such high enjoyments. Neither would this belief and
sealing qualify them for joining in the song of the
redeemed, Unto him that hath loved us, and washed us
from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings
and priests unto God and his Father, to him be glory and
dominionfor ever and ever. They cannot sing this divine
song experimentally now; much more in the kingdom
of glory above; for were they made seosible, through the
teaching of God the Spirit, of their native filth and
practical impurity, they would not attempt to blind the
minds of silly mortals by granting them this infamous
passport to glory: neither would the incredulous be so
easily duped, by placing a dependance on such a broken
reed as Joanna's seals will, in the end, prove to be ; for
the Spirit of truth always leads the subject of his opera­
tions to see the need of the application of, the blood of
sprinkling to their guilty consciences. So when God is
pleased by his efficacious grace to convince of sin, no
paper seal from Joanna will bring* peace aqd tranquillity
to the soul; and such refuges of lies will then fail.
Were the sealer and the sealed to experience a powerful
conviction of the moral perfections of God as displayed
in his holy, just, and good law, then the sealer would
renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, and the sea­
led would no longer be caught by craftiuess and guile.
The apostle Paul makes mention in his epistle to the
Ephe^ns, 1 chap. 13 and 14 verses, That the Ephe­
sians, After they believed were sealed (uot with Joan-
S
a’s seal, but) with that holy Spirit of promisewhich

tion of the purchased possession; which sealing most
of Joanna's followers appear to be ignorant .of; because
many them knoyv not the first principles of true religion

in their hearts; as is very evident by their being so easily
deluded into the snare of the devil.
I am compelled to believe that the apostle Paul did
n o t believe either in Joanna's mission or doctrine, being
persuaded such diabolical trumpery never found place
in the heart of that blessed man of God, nor in the hearts
o f the believers in Christ who were found living in the
idolatrous city of Ephesus. Paul never told them to
believe in Joanna9 or her child, but in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and they should be saved. He never mentioned
a single word about Joanna's seal, but he told them of
the Spirit of promise by whom they were sealed unto the
day of redemption. And, blessed be God, it i3 under
the anointing, teaching, and sealing of this Spirit of
the living God, that true believers joy in God through
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom they have received the
atonement. This sealing also produces that peace and
tranquility, which Paul says, passeth all understandings
and which every real believer in the Lord Jesus Christ is
brought experimentally to know in this world. Should
any of her followers be happily favoured with the light,
teaching, and quickening power of the Holy Spirit, and
Especially his sealing and comforting influence realized
in their experience, and they he led by him into a know­
ledge of the deep things of God as they are revealed in
bis glorious gospel; then farewell to her papers, the seal
of which will be no longer trusted unto: but blessing
and praises will be ascribed to that God by whose eter­
nal love and almighty power they have been delivered
from the snare of the devil; under who^e satanic influ­
ence they have been kept in bondage, and who has so
blinded their eyes as to palm upon them tinsel for pure
gold. They will not then fear hell and damnation as
their lot, in consequence of breaking her seals, neither
will they lose the protection of God thereby, asshe has en­
deavoured to make them brlieve by her gross absurdities;
for when the love of Christ is shed abroad in the heart,
it banishes every fear, except a filial one; and this fear,
which is through the operation of the Spirit of God,
rules and reigns in the heart. Hence the apostle Paul
declares, It is faith that marketk by hvet because it
flows from the act of believing (not in foam a, but) ip
the Lord Jesus Christ.

26 REMARKS OH THE W RItlNOS
From what I have written I shall not be surprised to
to find ere long my doom fixed by her, her followers,
and the Spirit that dictates her works j I expect the irre­
vocable sentence will be the damnation of my soul and
body, and a separation from the blissful presence of the
Triune Jehovah. But as it is an indifferent matter to
me what her spirit may dictate to her, 1 shall be in no
wise terrified, knowing what I have written to be the
troth; and had I time to go regularly through the whole
of her inconsistent jargon, 1 might bTiug many more of
her absurdities to light, and shonld not shrink from a
contest with her or her brethren.
Having proved her to be an nniversalist, and an advo­
cate for election, (in her sense of the word) I would,
before I conclude, ask her, if she does not also belieye
in the doctrine of transmigration of souls? Shis.certainly
does, though perhaps she does not know it, or she would
never cause to be printed such gross absurdities as areto
be found in her works by every attentive reader. What
I allude t«
» is this: in one of her books she says, that
the Reverend Mr. Bruce, who was one of the men that
was to examine her books, is the man-child spoken of in
the Revelations, that was to rule all nations with a rod ?
©f iron, but before her works were examined by him, he *
was no more in time, but was-caiight up to God and to
his throne, and that it was mx days and nights before he
arrived ; so that nothing could be done iu heaven before
Bruce’s arrival.” In her third Bouk of Wonders, page
32 and .33, she says, “ It is not the woman makes the
nations shake that is with child, travailing in birth,
and pained to be delivered, but it is the child, when
he is born. Then the nations will begin to shake, and
then they will know if thou art the woman mentioned
in the Kevelations to bring the man-child into the
world/’ This child,” she informs us, “ was caught
up to God and his throne, on account of the dragon
which stood before her” (which must imply that it is
herself as she is to be the mother of this mail-child) “ in
older to devour it as soon as it was born.” She likewise
tells us, that “ it hath, a meaning which men do not
understand, but this she shall leave tq try their wisdom,
and it will be explained farther when she sees jthe wie- '
dom of men.” I suppose she had forgot that she had
Digitized by Google
already told us that Bruce was the man-child that was
caught up to God* and to his throne. Biit purely sf)3
cannot be pregnant with Mr* Bruce ? If so, he must
have descended from the heavenly regions and,entered!
into her womb; as in the first instance she tells1us Mr*.
Bruce is the man-child spoken of in the Revelations ;
and secondly* that is the fhild she is pregnant with, who,
when, he is born* is to shake the nations* and is to make
his appearance a second time in the world sp that she
must be a believer in transmigration,' unless she can
prove that there^ure two men children spokenof in the
Revelation^ . ‘

After all tbjat has b^en said* hpw necessary it is to
pay attention to the standard of truth,and how applica­
ble is the* exhortation of Paul to the church at Inessa*

For having perused her almost qpmberless absurdities,
I am constrained to fol)ow, the apostle Peter's direction
to the elect Jews, who were enabled to believe on ibe
Lord Jesus Christ as the one only Saviour provided for
every elect vessel of mercy by God the Father from
eternity, who was manifested hi the flesh to destroy the
works of the devil; who brought in everlasting righte­
ousness, which "is-unto and upon all them that believe*
whether Jew or Gentile; and whom the Holy Spirit tes­
tifies of in his person, obedience* sufferings, and death*
to the hearts of his redeemed ones, as their only Saviour
and Redeemer. Wherefore Peter well informs us, Wt

well to take heed as unto a tight that ehinttk in a dark

Such have free access to the mercy seat, through the
blood of the everlasting covenant; and are given experi­
mentally to enjoy communion with the Father of mer­
cies and God of all consolation, through the Lord Jesus
Christ, the one Mediator between God and man; and
this is given them freely to enjoy without money and
without price; for the gift of God is eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord. But as to Jesus Christ and his
Son, 1 know nothing of any such blasphemous doctrine!
It is sufficient for me to be informed by the lip of truth,
that whosoever believeth on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be
saved. Herein / rejoice, yea, and will rejoice, with all
the redeemed who are taught by the Holy Spirit not to
trust in an arm of flesh, nor in broken reeds, or refuges
of lies; neither in paper seals, or any such trash; but in
the atoning blood and spotless righteousness of the Lord
Jesus, the friend of every sinner who is loved with an
everlasting love, and with loving-kindness is drawn, and
preserved firamembracing such errors as are now propa­
gating in the world.
I shall now conclude this small work with the follow­

- No other Saviour is for me,
But him who died on Calvary.
No other Saviour is my king
But him who did salvation bring:

Till I shall reign with him above*

And those who have for refuge fled

Christ is the way, the only way,
That leads to realms of endless day;
No other jefuge will I own
But him who was at Bethlehem born,
Joanna’sSaviour may pass by,
He will not bleed for me, nor die:
My Christ hath lov’d my soul so well
He died to ransom it from hell. '
All glory to his precious name,
His love for ever is the same:
This many of hi$ own have felt,
Which oft hath*made their hearts to melt
She on me nowmay pass my doom:
In hell, for me, there is no room,
Free grace, andydyfag^ove indeed
My captive soul from thence hath freed.
Now if against me she should write,
And send me to the shades of night,
1 ne’er shall fear what she may do,
Because it’s truth I have in view.,
Her free-will work fights God’s decree:
* , Tbis every one may clearly see^-
.•I know ’tis true, I see ’tis so.<; -t \ -V

She proves herself tmth's mortaVfbe,
