  		              		Experience Description   

    My experience happened during a seizure in the middle of the night in  September 2013. The seizure was caused due to a blood clot in the left frontal lobe of my brain. I saw myself in the mirror with a single streak of blood flowing from the right corner of my lips. I had bitten my tongue into two pieces during the seizure.  I felt no pain and I was calm and quiet. I was not in my body and  was seeing from above. Then I saw my body sitting in the left front seat of our  red car. My husband was driving through a huge, black steel gate and stopped in front of a building complex. 
  
  A few moments later, I floated down from bright light into a place with white curtains and many partitions. I see that the light is still bright, like it is the only presence around and it is everywhere. I moved from one corner of the wall, went around and then settled in one spot. I was seeing all that is happening, but not through my eyes. A lean man with wires and tubes all over his body was looking at me. I was thinking, 'Why this man is staring at me?' and sensed that he was in the ICU for renal failure. I slowly started to feel my eyes, mouth and my physical body. At that time, a person dressed in white was brushing my teeth and wiping my mouth with a cotton swab. I realized that I was in the ICU of some hospital and that the person attending to me was a nurse. My body mildly shook and I asked the nurse,  'Where am I? Why am I here?'
  
  The nurse immediately called the doctors and informed them that I had regained consciousness. After the initial check-ups, my husband came and I immediately hugged him. I had  tears in my eyes as I said,'I am back. No need to worry anymore.' My husband is not able to recall me saying this, so I assume that I must have felt that way. Then the rest of my family came and my children ran to me. After the initial meeting, they were worried about  the way I talked and how my tongue looked. They very gently held my tongue together for a few seconds every time they visited me in the hospital.
  
  My husband did not tell me anything other than I had seizures in the middle of the night and we went to the hospital. I did not want him to recall an unpleasant situation and make him remember his fear of losing me. He told me that I was not responding and was in a semi-coma state for almost a day. The medical reports said the same. The clot dissolved on its own and the bloodflow resumed by itself. Although they had medicated me to bring me into a normal active state. 
  
  I am trying to remember what happened after I saw everything from above until I floated down from the bright light. I do not remember or recall any of the in-between. I do not fear death. Dying is peaceful, calm and I felt absolutely no pain.  I only fear  not coming back to the same body and this life. I strongly believe and sense that I came back because I do not want to let go of this body and this life because of my husband and my children.
