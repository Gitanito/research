Abstract:

  One-hundred and seven elderly and   non-elderly participants were recruited from the university setting and the   senior setting. Questionnaires were filled out which examined the near-death   experience (NDE) and life review. A Fisher exact test indicated no significant   differences in the incidence of the NDE between the elderly and non-elderly. A   small sample size did not allow for a statistical analysis of the incidence of   the life review and the rate of onset of the NDE among the elderly and   non-elderly. However, tentative speculation was made about the eight reported   NDEs. In future research, either a recruiting method should be employed or a   larger sample should be drawn.

Proposal for   Incidence and Causes of the Near-Death Experience and Life Review among the   Elderly and Non-Elderly

  The near-death experience (NDE) has been   around for centuries. Famous figures such as St. Paul and Gregory the Great have   captured the public's attention with accounts of what it is like on the other   side (Zaleski, 1987). Much of the recent interest in the NDE began following   Raymond Moody's (1975) book, Life After Life, which described the   phenomenon that people frequently experience when coming close to dying based on   about fifty people who were interviewed in great detail. Through these case   studies, Moody found anecdotal evidence that humans survive bodily death (Moody,   1975).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon,   other researchers wanted to validate Moody's work with more scientific   approaches. One such researcher was Kenneth Ring. Describing many of the same   stages that Moody did, he described the 'core experience' of the NDE in five   stages including peace and a sense of well-being, body separation, entering the   darkness, seeing the light, and entering the light (Ring, 1980). However, not   all NDEs follow that exact pattern.&nbsp; Some NDEs skip stages and certain aspects   can be quite distinct from the typical NDE (Serdahely, 1989; 1995).   Additionally, the core experiences do not occur with equal frequency.&nbsp; In one   study, sixty percent experienced the 'peace' stage while only ten percent   'entered the light' (Ring, 1980).&nbsp; Other characteristics of the NDE include a   sense of timelessness, a sense of death, and ineffability when trying to   describe it (Sabom, 1982).

  The NDE is defined as: 'An altered state of   consciousness occurring during an episode of unconsciousness resulting from   severe trauma or other life-threatening condition, in which a series of   well-defined characteristics are present. It is identified by self-report on a   questionnaire using standard questions and by content analysis of anecdotal data   using the Near-Death Experience Scale (NDES) (Greyson, 1983b) with a score of   seven as an indication of a near-death experience' (Olson &amp; Dulaney, 1993).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The life   review is defined as: 'a naturally occurring reminiscence; may be formalized   into an intervention designed to assist the elderly to achieve ego integrity or   may occur in other contexts, such as a near-death experience' (Olson &amp; Dulaney,   1993). One question from the NDES, 'Did scenes from your past come back to you?'   was used to determine if a life review was present. If the participant indicated   that they had remembered many past events or their past had flashed before them,   out of their control, they were considered to have had a life review.

  Ring (1980) found the life review to be a   relatively common phenomenon that occurred in about twenty-five percent of his   sample.&nbsp; Other studies have found this percentage to be as low as three percent   (Sabom, 1982) and as high as over fifty percent (Atwater, 1994).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Life   review in a non-NDE context has been found to be therapeutic.&nbsp; For example,   people who reminisce have a better self-concept of themselves and their past   (Lewis, 1971). Those who reminisce have also been shown to have higher morale   than those who don't (Coleman, 1986).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erik   Erikson's final stage in human development is ego integrity vs. despair. In it,   the integration of self becomes a goal for those in their final stage of life (Erikson,   1950).

The life review   occurs more in the aged during life because of an older person's actual nearness   to death, because an older person is retired and has more time for   self-reflection, and 'the customary defensive operation provided by work has   been removed' (Butler, 1963).

  Two common theories of the NDE are a   psychological explanation and a physiological explanation. Proponents of the   psychological explanation believe that the threat of imminent death is so great   that the NDEer is forced to depersonalize and create a story as a defense   mechanism to help them cope with the trauma of nearly dying (Noyes &amp; Kletti,   1977). Adherents of the physiological explanation maintain that the phenomena   reported by NDEers is a result of a dying brain.

  There are some aspects of the NDE that cannot   be readily explained by these theories, however. Some people who were apparently   'unconscious' at the time of their death report extremely detailed descriptions   of doctors in the operating room, what surgery was being done to them, how the   surgery was being done and what the doctors were saying (Sabom, 1982). It is   common for a NDEer to find himself or herself hovering above their body, a calm   bystander who often has little desire to reenter the physical body. Some people   even have NDEs while being subjected to an autopsy and remember what was being   done to them (Atwater, 1994).

  Sometimes, this phenomenon is dispelled with   claims that it is merely a hallucination, induced by drugs being administered at   the time of death. There is good reason to doubt this. The NDE occurs even in   the total absence of drugs. Additionally, many drugs result in a variety of   experiences that are rarely similar to NDEs (Audain, 1999), although a few   drugs, such as ketamine and DMT, have produced NDE-like phenomena. Indeed,   NDEers who have also experienced hallucinations consider their NDE to be 'more   real' than ordinary reality which, in turn is 'more real' than hallucinations   they have experienced (Greyson, 2000).

  The veridicality of some observations made by   people during a NDE also creates greater doubt of the physiological and   psychological explanations. Kenneth Ring and Sharon Cooper examined near-death   experiences in blind people. Fifteen out of the twenty-three blind NDEers were   able to see during their NDE. The verdicality of some of these visions were   corroborated by others (Ring and Cooper, 1997).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Regardless of one's personal philosophy regarding the explanation for NDEs, a   closer examination of them is warranted. The NDE changes the lives and attitudes   of these people drastically (Ring, 1980). Whatever the explanation is for the   NDE, a better understanding of them is of importance to the scientific   community.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this   study, I will attempt to determine whether a difference exists in the NDEs of   the elderly and the non-elderly.&nbsp; Olson and Dulaney (1993) found that none of   their elderly NDEers encountered a life review. This finding was surprising, as   other research has shown that there appeared to be no distinct differences in   the incidence of the NDE according to such categories as age, area of residence,   size of home community, religious background, or frequency of church attendance   (Sabom, 1982). Why should the incidence of the life review be any different?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noyes and   Kletti found that twenty-nine percent of their subjects had experienced a life   review during life-threatening incidents. Those percentages become higher still   when the near-death experience involved a near drowning (forty-three percent) or   an auto accident (thirty-three percent) (Ring, 1980).&nbsp;

  Ring speculated that a possible determinant   of the incidence of a life review is the suddenness or unexpectedness of the   near-death crisis. For instance, he found that the life review was reported by   fifty-five percent of accident victims, while occurring in only sixteen percent   of those in his other two categories, illness and suicide (Ring, 1980). Others   have found the life review to be more common when the rate of onset is sudden   rather than gradual (Stevenson &amp; Cook, 1995). Could it be that the elderly,   having already had time later in their life to reminisce, no longer need to   review their life after they die? Could it also be that people who nearly die of   illness have more time to review their life before they undergo a NDE? The   elderly may undergo a NDE following an illness more frequently than the   non-elderly who may experience more accidents or suicide attempts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order   to determine possible causes of the absence or infrequency of the incidence of a   life review in the elderly compared to the non-elderly, the rate of onset   (sudden or gradual) of the NDE was examined. This may give some insight about   whether the incidence of the life review within an NDE is a function of age or   whether suddenness is also a determining factor. In order to remain consistent   with Olson and Dulaney, the elderly are operationally defined as fifty-five or   older. The non-elderly are thus younger than fifty-five.

  In this study, the following questions will   be addressed: Is the incidence of the NDE greater for the non-elderly than the   elderly? Is the incidence of the life review greater for the non-elderly than   the elderly? Does the rate of onset of a NDE correlate with the incidence of a   life review?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted,   even if a correlation would be found between the rate of onset of the NDE and   the incidence of a life review, a causal relationship cannot be inferred.   However, through future examination and different studies, this relationship can   be more thoroughly understood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three   hypotheses were developed. First, the incidence of the near-death experience   would not be significantly greater for the non-elderly than for the elderly.   Secondly, the incidence of the life review would be greater for the non-elderly   than for the elderly. Finally, the rate of onset of the NDE would be correlated   with the incidence of a life review.

  Method  Participants

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The   target population included one group of people aged fifty-five and older and   another group of people below the age of fifty-five. A total of twenty-three   elderly people were recruited from local nursing homes and a senior center in   Eau Claire, Wisconsin. These participants ranged in age from sixty-two to one   hundred. Their mean age was 77.1 with a standard deviation of 8.67. A total of   eighty-four students were recruited from six classes at the University of   Wisconsin-Eau Claire. These participants ranged in age from nineteen to   fifty-one. Their mean age was 22.7 with a standard deviation of 5.6.&nbsp; Five of   the classes consisted of traditional students. One class had a high percentage   of non-traditional, older students.&nbsp; Participants from all settings were of the   intended age for that group. In other words, all participants at nursing homes   and the senior center were age fifty-five and older and all participants at the   university were under fifty-five.   Apparatus

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A   five-page survey was distributed in addition to a cover letter. The first part   contained an initial page that all participants filled out in order to get   demographic information and to determine which participants might have had a   near-death experience. Writing utensils were administered when needed. By   answering yes to two questions, participants were asked to proceed in filling   out form one. On form one, Greyson's NDES (Near Death Experience Scale) (1983b)   was used to asses the incidence of an near-death experience.&nbsp; The NDES has high   internal consistency, split-half reliability and test-retest reliability Greyson   (1983b). A score of seven or over indicated a near-death experience. A score of   lower than seven did not necessarily mean that certain aspects typical of the   near-death experience did not occur.&nbsp; It meant that there was not enough   evidence to label the experience as a near-death experience. If participants did   not indicate that they might have had a near-death experience, they filled out   form two which consisted of questions about their knowledge and beliefs about   near-death experiences, but was not be used in this particular study. One reason   for this form was so participants who indicated that they might have had a NDE   would not feel isolated when filling out form one.  Procedure

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most   participants filled out the questionnaires in a group setting. Six participants   filled out the questionnaires at their leisure after picking them up from a   stack of questionnaires that was left for a week and a half period. At the   university, the questionnaires were filled out at the beginning of class. First,   a general explanation of the study was provided for them. They were informed   that they did not have to participate and could stop at any time. Then, they   were given the questionnaires and instructed to read and tear off the cover   letter before proceeding. If they indicated on the first page of the   questionnaire that they had a 'close call with death' and had an unusual   experience during this 'close call' (Olson &amp; Dulaney, 1993), they were directed   to fill out form one. If they did not indicate both of these, they were directed   to fill out form two. Participants were instructed to wait until everyone else   had finished, although this did not always happen and was irrelevant in one of   the senior settings in which everyone was waiting for a meal.

  Although a standardized procedure was   intended in order to prevent extraneous variables from affecting the results,   this was not always possible. In the L. E. Phillips Senior Center,   questionnaires were distributed to seniors who were waiting for a meal. The   setting was informal and the seniors were approached one table at a time. Time   constraints restricted a standardized introduction to the study. At one nursing   home, the questionnaires were dropped off and seniors were able to fill them out   at their leisure if they desired. Six questionnaires were obtained this way.

  The seniors sometimes required assistance in   filling out their packets. If they did not understand a certain question and   asked for help or if they were taking an inordinate amount of time, assistance   was provided. This was done by re-reading particular questions or telling them   which packet they were supposed to fill out as indicated by their previous   answers. Almost all university students had no problems in filling out the   survey.

  When participants were finished, their   questionnaires were retrieved. In the case of the University of Wisconsin-Eau   Claire classes, teachers were allowed to present their students with extra   credit for completing they questionnaires if they so desired.

  Results

An analysis   of 107 participants from the university and senior settings was performed in   order to better understand certain features of the NDE, specifically the   incidence of the NDE, the incidence of a life review and the rate of onset. Of   the 107 respondents who had adequately filled out the questionnaire, 90 (84.1%)   were female, 16 (15%) were male and 1 (0.9%) neglected to select a gender. Of   the 84 non-elderly participants, 72 (85.7%) were female and 12 (14.3%) were   male. Of the 23 elderly participants, 18 (78.3%) were female and 4 (17.4%) were   male. The elderly population (M=77.1, SD=8.7) was much older than   the non-elderly population (M=22.7, SD=5.6).&nbsp; It was hypothesized   that the incidence of the near-death experience would not be more common in the   elderly, life review would be more common in the non-elderly and incidence of   life review and rate of onset of NDE would be correlated.

Of all   respondents, (10.3%) indicated that they had had a close call with death and   that they had an unusual experience at that time. Of these 11, 8 (7.5%) had a   NDE as indicated by a score of 7 or more on the NDES (M=11.1, SD=3.1).   In the elderly sample, 4 of 23 respondents (17.4%) had had a NDE. Two of the   elderly did not respond as to when they had had their NDE. Of the two that did   respond, one had their NDE 62 years ago at the age of 19. The other's NDE   occurred 39 years ago at the age of 34. In the non-elderly sample, 4 of 84   respondents (4.7%) had had a NDE. For the non-elderly, the average of 2 years   had elapsed since their NDE. A Fisher exact test supported the null hypothesis   that incidence of the near-death experience was not more common in the elderly   than the non-elderly (p &gt; .05, p = .063). Of the 8 NDEers, 5 (62.5%)   experienced a life review. Of the 4 non-elderly NDEers, 3 (75%) had a life   review. Of the 4 elderly NDEers, 2 (50%) had a life review. All 8 NDEers had a   sudden rate of onset (100%). This data is presented in figure 1. The small   number of NDEers prevented any specific statistical analysis to be done among   that particular group. Tentative speculation about this population will be   mentioned later.

  Discussion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An   overall NDE incidence of 7.5% is consistent with previous findings. A 17%   incidence of the NDE in the elderly and a 4.7% incidence in the non-elderly   might seem like a great discrepancy, but due to the few NDEers, a more powerful   statistic was used which did not result in a statistically significant   difference. Maybe a larger study from which a greater number on NDEers could be   obtained which would provide better insight as to whether or not differences   exist between the two groups.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to   few NDEs with which to analyze and because none of the seniors had had a NDE   after the age of 55, it is difficult to speculate on differences between the NDE   in the elderly and the non-elderly. However, insights can still be extracted   from the data. Perhaps there are longitudinal effects among the different   generations. One major factor that may play a role in the differences is that   the NDE has only become more recognizable, if not more accepted in the general   public in the past two decades.

  An Australian sample of 173 respondents   showed positive attitudes toward the NDE (Kellehear &amp; Heaven, 1989). Perhaps   younger people are more comfortable with their near-death experiences because   they already heard about them before they experienced one themselves, or maybe   they received support from people who understood what they had gone through.   Perhaps the elderly people who had their NDE several decades ago were treated   coldly by medics and loved ones when they told of their experience, causing them   to either repress them or withhold from telling about them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data   from the present study does not seem to indicate that the elderly have repressed   memories of NDEs. The percentage of NDEs among the elderly (17.4) was actually   much greater than the percentage of NDEs among the non-elderly (4.7).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One   explanation for this finding is that the elderly people who had NDEs when they   were much younger were not affected by any negative feedback if they in fact   received any. A second explanation is that they have kept their experiences to   themselves but were willing to relate them in an anonymous, relatively   non-obtrusive format that the questionnaire provided. Yet another explanation is   that these elderly people suppressed their memories of their NDEs, only to have   them resurface after hearing about the phenomena following a resurgence in their   popularity in recent times. A follow-up questioning of these people might inform   this issue. Another obvious reason for the much greater incidence in NDEs among   the elderly in this study is the greater number of years living that the elderly   have had with which to experience a NDE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although   the sample size was too small to be able to draw any conclusions from, a greater   percentage of non-elderly people experienced a life review (75%) than   non-elderly people (50%). This is in agreement with the hypothesis. Yet, it may   be of even greater interest that two of the elderly NDEers did experience a life   review. This runs contrary to the findings of Olson &amp; Dulaney (1993) who found   that none of the elderly NDEers had experienced a life review. They also   indicated that through personal communication with them in 1986, NDE researcher   Bruce Greyson also did not find the life review to be present among any of his   elderly NDEers (Olson &amp; Dulaney, 1993).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although   the two elderly participants indicated a life review by reporting that scenes   from the past came back to them, they were not interviewed, which previous   researchers of the life review have been able to do. An interview would help to   confirm or disconfirm whether they had a life review.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A   limitation of this study is that a non-random sample was used. Participants all   lived or went to school in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. In addition, specific groups   were selected in a non-random manner. However, generalization was increased by   the selection of several different groups. Classes in different departments were   selected and seniors were approached at three different senior settings. While   the extremely high female percentage (84.1%) was somewhat representative of the   populations being approached, it is quite unrepresentative of the general   population. Reasons for such a high rate of female participation include the   high percentage of females attending UW-Eau Claire, especially in library   science classes, and the greater longevity of females in the senior setting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Extraneous variables may have had an effect on this study. While the non-elderly   all completed the questionnaire in a similar, classroom setting, the same cannot   be said for the elderly. Where the questionnaires were completed was limited to   the most convenient or practical place available. One group was approached table   by table while they were waiting for a meal. Another group filled out   questionnaires on an individual basis at their leisure by picking them up from a   stack of questionnaires that was left at a nursing home for a week and a half.   &nbsp;&nbsp;

  Regrettably, an in depth analysis of the life   review and the rate of onset of the NDE is impossible due to the small number of   NDEers. This problem was complicated further in that all NDEers who responded   reported a sudden onset. This finding is understandable considering that they   all were non-elderly at the time of their NDE. This does not allow for any   speculation as to possible correlation between the rate of onset and the   incidence of a life review.

  Future research is needed to determine what   relationship exists between the rate of onset of NDEs and the incidence of life   reviews. Perhaps in an interview setting, participants might be asked why they   think they did or did not encounter a life review. Elderly NDEers could be asked   whether or not they had gone through a reminiscence similar to that described by   Lewis (1971) and Coleman (1986). If they had, it might be hypothesized that they   would encounter life reviews less frequently than elderly who had not reminisced   before their NDE.

  A primary limitation of this study was the   small sample size of NDEers. A detailed analysis of NDEers as well as adequate   measures of incidence the NDE and life review are difficult to obtain   simultaneously.&nbsp; In future research, one of two methods could be employed.   Either NDEers could be recruited through various methods or much larger samples   could be used. Recruiting NDEers would be easier to do, but the generalization   of these samples would be less. Using larger samples would increase   generalization, but such large samples may be impractical because of economic or   time restraints.&nbsp;
