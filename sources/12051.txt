I then was trying to find the edge of the deep end when I slipped and went under the water. I tried to grab a woman's swimsuit; she felt it but seen nothing. I blacked out. When I come to, I am floating above the pool with a spirit or ghost beside me. I ask it why no one is helping me (I can see everyone around my body and hear everything they are saying, still thirty-two years later like it happened today)? The being floating with me tells me without moving its mouth or saying anything that, 'The world is not as loving as you think.' I was not given CPR or mouth to mouth. I remember getting angry because they were not helping me. Suddenly I felt myself go back into my body; I come to coughing and crying. I tell them to get away from me, ride my bike home, and tell my mother what happened. She took me to the hospital where they find nothing wrong with me.
