my name is Paul H shoots and my father&#39;s
name is Paul a Utes my father I was
first of all raised in Kwajalein
Marshall Islands in the South Pacific
from the age of five through seventh
grade my father was relocated from that
military installation to Nellis Air
Force Base where he continued to serve
out his career he had always informed
our family that he was an optical
engineer and worked on and ranged 61 and
range 62 which are is a non-secure range
north of Tonopah Nevada my father would
leave every morning at about 4:30
quarter to 5:00 and come home very late
at night about 7:30 8 o&#39;clock so I
really didn&#39;t have much interaction with
him growing up
first of all he he would leave at the
airport we lived very close to the
airport very close to where Wayne Newton
lives in that area of Las Vegas and he
would get on a 737 aircraft that was
unmarked they did not have any
identification numbers on it there was a
number of them maybe five or six
aircraft in the fleet and he would leave
on this aircraft every morning he did a
lot of TDY missions to fly from where to
where
from sure no problem from Las Vegas to
area 51 which is also known as dreamland
also there was a number of different
people one of the people that I&#39;d like
to mention was my father&#39;s boss his name
was Tom Hamilton he was on Kwajalein
missile range and most of the people
that were in the group at the missile
range transferred to this particular
area of the country
my father basically very conservative I
was raised to a Republican I was very
active in the LDS Church growing up the
Mormon Church or latter date latter-day
saints church which is a very
conservative usually most people that
are in the church a Republican based and
we basically my father was a very
conservative in his nature we would do
he would bring a lot of equipment home
from time to time we keep it in the
garage and then it would disappear he
would take it back to wherever he was
this whole story really begins when
after he retired and this was in 1993 I
was working in an export business and
was going back and forth between San
Francisco area and and Munich Germany
and my father and I hooked up over there
and it was one of the first times that
ever really ever had
the opportunity to interact with him and
to converse with him and we said in a
beer garden in Munich and he basically
had been withholding a tremendous amount
of truths and he had come to a point
where he wanted to share with me a
little bit more about himself and who he
was because he felt that he had
neglected me growing up and and he had
told me that he&#39;d worked at a secure
installation and as I queried him
further he talked about that he was
given different technologies that were
given from universities that&#39;s what his
explanation was and that he was he and
his team were to recreate the
technologies or adapt them in certain
ways and most the project that he had
had worked on he had been working on it
for a number of years like five or six
or seven years and it concluded when
they had tested a device that was
supposed to be a new type of energy
source direction and they had taken it
out into the range and it had it
literally blown up when they tried to
activate it and they tried to turn it on
one of the things that he found
interesting was that it had a lot of
organic composition within the material
structure and my father isn&#39;t a very
detailed oriented person because he&#39;s he
lives a whole life of Secrets and I
think I think this is more of an
emotional issue for me because my whole
life I thought my father was somebody
else than he really was and it my
parents divorced after 28 years of
marriage a lot of these reasons occurred
I remember in high school my father was
getting security clearances that he
called a family meeting
and had literally said you&#39;re going to
be investigated I&#39;m going through a
process right now and my father told me
that he was going for acute clearance
and he I didn&#39;t he was a GS 16 rated and
government service he had started at
White Sands Missile Range in his career
and then continued on through his whole
career during the same direction and we
did there my mother was working as a
legal secretary at the time and and
there was people that were following us
from our house that we&#39;re not even
trying to be secret about it they were
just kind of like in unmarked police
vehicles and cars like that and we
didn&#39;t really think anything of it
because you know my dad told us that
that&#39;s what was gonna happen and that
was that was something that was a little
bit unusual that it occurred and then
there had been some other things that
had occurred with with Tom Hamilton I
didn&#39;t make the connection nor did I see
Tom Hamilton for years and when I was in
high school we were finishing up a
baseball game and my father had stopped
said I wanted to go but he says I want
to go see a friend and we pulled into a
bar and we went into the bar and my
father had never my father doesn&#39;t drink
or anything like this and I guess he
felt that I&#39;ll have to go in but when I
went inside there was Tom Hamilton that
I hadn&#39;t seen since I was five or six
years old and that&#39;s when the first
connection was made that tom was still
acting as my father&#39;s boss or and Tom
had a severe drinking problem he was a
very heavy alcoholic and I&#39;ve even
remembered that as a kid he and then
that&#39;s what started the whole
perspective of what does my father do
you know the planes that he gets on
where is what is he doing where is he
going
what kind of equipment is he bringing
home but I&#39;d remember him getting
frustrated at one time when he
took a bunch of equipment that he had to
Dreamland and one of the rules he told
me is that nothing comes out of there
this is anything that comes in there
stays there even all the trash and
everything and he also did a lot of TDY
trips to mercury mercury one Tim it&#39;s a
temporary assignment of duty to I think
but he would do a lot of to to Dugway
and to Dugway and a lot of different
bases i mean where he would go he says
that it was developed by a university
and that it was a technology and that
his group and his team were developing
it further and studying it further and
that it had organic components and
organic almost like it had consciousness
and and he wasn&#39;t given the whole piece
he was only given a certain aspect of it
and i think that there was other teams
working on other aspects of the same
unit and i think that was part of
security protocol to keep things
segregated and not you know need-to-know
basis type of thing and when they tried
to reinvent it it blew up I don&#39;t think
my father would have told me any of this
if he hadn&#39;t been intoxicated and I
think as the years get older that right
now my father is a very miserable person
because he doesn&#39;t have any family
anymore he&#39;s retired he&#39;s very wealthy
and we really don&#39;t understand a lot of
where he gets a lot of his funding his
money because we we were raised
upper-middle class but we didn&#39;t have
excessive anything but he well it well
you know you know I&#39;m working hard right
now my mother&#39;s working hard right now
you know we&#39;re all working and my father
is going to Club Med&#39;s all around the
world you know one after the other board
with his life and unfulfilled in
is a soul I think that and I think
there&#39;s so much withholding issues that
he has dealt with in this area that it&#39;s
really clouded clouded his his vision
all the government has lots of secrets
and I I realized that I&#39;m we had knew
everything on the missile range we had
everything we could think of
I mean abundance of everything but it
was it was also the years of I I want to
tell another story that I that is very
poignant and I think I&#39;m just
remembering this now and that is that we
were watching TV and this is when the
stealth bomber had come out and my
father got up out of his chair and it
was the news and he made a phone call
and a few minutes later he was picked up
in front of the house and he said he&#39;d
be back in a few days that&#39;s what he
told us and then he left and when he
came back he had said that President
Carter had had taken some security some
highly secretive information regarding
the stealth technology and released it
to the media for the purpose of creating
a political agenda for himself and other
people but what had happened is that
they were trying to figure out who where
the leak had occurred and my father was
a suspect in that and there was some
other people that were as well and that
was I was in 11th grade and that
occurred and that was very very
interesting well we didn&#39;t really have
we didn&#39;t really operate as a family
unit being open about our feelings
everything was kept a secret
and so that was carried on you know even
my mother you know and so it affected us
as as human beings and it you know when
I graduated school it was very difficult
to interact with people because I felt I
felt that there was a lot of discord
that was going on and you know what is
the truth and what is a lie and where do
they come together and
so I had a lot of values about that I
had a lot of issues with that and the
way that I dealt with that personally is
I just left the scene the moment that I
could financially and after my education
to go do what I wanted to do and just
ignore him and we really kept at at a
distance for quite a number of years
until the encounter in Germany where he
he broke down to me it&#39;s amazing that I
remember some of these names like Tom
Hamilton because he was I think he was
such a main psychological visualization
of somebody that I would see a number of
years apart
and he was always drinking martinis and
you know he was trying to cover up the
pain and and that&#39;s the way I look at it
now it&#39;s like there was a there was a
pain that he was covering up being
involved with all of us and and his son
Timothy I mean that I kind of saw later
a number of years later you know had a
lot of same issues that that I did with
my father I mean didn&#39;t really interact
with them a lot of Secrets a lot of
separation but my father had a lot of
access I remember going up to secure
areas on range 61 which is a just east
of Tonopah it&#39;s mostly that whole area
east of Tonopah and he had all the keys
and all the codes and and you know
special badges and he wouldn&#39;t you know
we go through lock security gates and
then take you know government trucks and
government vehicles and I was always
amazed because my father wasn&#39;t a
military man and really despised the
military didn&#39;t really respect a lot of
the upper ranking officers you know he
would always say mr. Edwards or somebody
I don&#39;t like him or you know he always
had something something negative to say
so it always contention going between
the civilians and the military the civil
service so he was a GS 16 and which is a
government service rated which
I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s an equivalent
to what like a Lieutenant Colonel would
be if you were to to compare them and he
did have some sort of authority in that
we&#39;re at Air Force it I think it just
really added up when he started telling
me that he really wasn&#39;t the optical
engineer that he had told me he was and
that he was involved with a number of
different scientists and he had a part
in this team to create a new energy
source and that&#39;s what they were they
were doing I think that it had to do
with the promotion that he had it was
called Q Clarence but and it did change
a lot of markings on his badge I mean he
had a badge and had his photo on it and
there was a number of squares that went
all the way around it and for years
there was only certain squares filled in
and then when he received this other
clearance then there was all of them
filled in except just a few that weren&#39;t
filled in so I don&#39;t think that he had
complete access I said it&#39;s very clear
to anybody who studies at all that
they&#39;re extraterrestrial and the most
important things for your honor they
work so I would give a paper discussing
the different avenues that one could
explore in order to figure out how they
worked and it was long silence on the
phone had you never invited me of the
babe
so and then I did however attend the
conference anyway and I heard
