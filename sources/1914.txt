  The children's version of Charles and Myrtle Fillmore's Unity (q.v.),  published for a while (August 1895-July 1898) as a department of Unity, and then spun off as a separate journal.   Julius Dresser, The True History of Mental Science (New York, Alliance Publishing Co., c. 1899), say that this was the first mental-healing journal for children.  Beginning in 1939 this was published in Braille  in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Charles S. Braden, Spirits in Rebellion (1963), 246, says the journal had a circulation of a quarter of a million in 1960.
