I woke up in a place where the light was prevailing.  I can't seem to find the right words to describe the light.  Try to imagine the bright light of the day at noon, surrounding you from all over the place, nothing else but that light.  

I could see nothing but the light, everywhere I looked around me.  The one thing I could share with you is that any possible trace of pain or distress  has totally vanished in  such a place.  

I was incorporated in that light,  I(my soul) was reflecting the light, it was a wonderful feeling.  I could feel the peacefulness,  love and tranquility.  I was simply happy.  I was experiencing all these beautiful feelings,  although I could still feel my lips wailing with the pain I had prior to my getting there, as I had been crying before my crossing-over.  

My wail had in the meantime become, so to say a "fake" one because of  me now feeling the opposite way,  because I was now feeling happy.  I was though still not realizing what was happening to me.  At that moment in time I heard a voice asking me, "Why are you crying?" I looked around me and I could see somebody standing at a distance of 4-5 meters in front of me, as bright and shiny as the light that was prevailing in that place.  

I wasn't able to see his face clearly because of his brightness, neither did he tell me who he was.  I could sense, though, that he was Lord Jesus.  

Somebody else was standing next to him, a woman as bright and shiny as he was.  

I replied, "I want to go back to my mum!"  He answered, "Don't you like it here?"

I replied, "Yes, I do like it here!" He answered, "If you are going back now,  you might not be able to return here."  This is what I answered to him, "I want to go back to my mum!".  

Just to make one thing clear, I was giving him these answers because I still hadn't been able to realize what was happening to me.  

I couldn't understand the reason I was there.  

One thing's for sure-I was really happy there.  When I came back to my senses I was in my hospital- bed and my mum was next to me.  

My experience must probably be different  from any other experience,  this is the reason why I would like you to carefully examine it and give me your opinion about it.  

Thank you!
