  					 What I perceive to be an out-of-body experience is as follows…


I was driving home one evening around 11:00 PM, when I had a car accident. The weather was terrible - one of those short, violent summer storms that seem to suddenly appear out of nowhere. With the best of intentions, I was driving along, slightly faster than normal when I came to this tight bend in the road. I thought I was all set, since I already knew it was there, having driven down this particular road several times before, both in daylight and in darkness. However, as I remember, I was just emerging from this tight bend when the car skidded. It hit the curb, and then took off through the air for a distance of about twenty to thirty yards!!! The car finally came to rest by crashing into a brick wall that was at the side of the walkway.


This is when I had the out-of-body experience. I was floating outside of my car looking down at myself, my body sprawled motionless across both front seats.  What really makes me think I was dead for a short period is that everything visual was in reverse, just as you see it in the prints of film negatives.  Everywhere that should have been black was white, and everything that should have been white was black. And there I was, suspended in mid-air, looking down at myself lying in the car, dead.


There was no sound to be heard; there was no light nor dark, just the picture and negative.  The time lapse must have been only seconds, but it seemed that time had no reality. It seemed to me I had all the time in this world, because there was this unconscious light behind me!! It was calling me nearer to it— but, the faster I traveled towards this light, the farther away it seemed to become. That's when I traveled so fast that I saw myself appearing back in the car, re-entering my body and waking up. There was no pain at all during my accident, in fact, no feeling at all, other than a little discomfort from slight grazes. The car was wrecked - and the six-foot-tall, double-layer brick wall had to be rebuilt. The police were informed, and their investigation took its course.
