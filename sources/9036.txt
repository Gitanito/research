  I was alone at the time the heart attack hit. I was in a parking lot putting groceries in my car when I fell and  fractured my skull on the pavement. I don't know  how long I stayed that way.  A man called 911 and the bagboy at the grocery store came over and saw what was happening. He went into the store to get the Pharmacist and both performed CPR on m.  The rescue squad got there and had to defibrillate me twice. Then  the ambulance came and difibrillated me four  more times on the way to the hospital, which was 2-1/2 miles away. My hospital records show that I coded four times  in the first 24 hours. I was given 48 hours of hypothermic therapy and was in a coma for 6 more days. I was given 4 stents in my right coronary artery and a pacemaker. I woke from the coma with no idea what had happened, my sister was there to help with that. 

  I have no memory of the  6 weeks prior to the heart attack and  waking in the hospital with my sister. 

The only memory I have is an all-encompassing warm light and a peaceful serene sense that everything was as it should be. I have no fear of death now.
