The H.B. of L. went on to start the Occult Magazine in Glasgow.  The journal was filled with promises of occult wisdom and reprints of the "Sages of Antiquity" and featured articles by "Zanoni" and "Mejnour" (Thomas Henry Burgoyne and Peter Davidson), and has advertisements by Thomas (for magnetic healing at a distance) and by Davidson for his magic mirrors.
