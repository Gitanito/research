I was spouting blood out of my mouth like a fountain, so they told me.

It was then that I realized I was above my body looking down at it and at the hospital staff working hard trying to save me. I just floated there watching them. I didn't feel any fear or pain, just a very deep feeling of being at peace with everything and everyone. It felt incredible!

I floated down and onto the floor.  I'm not sure why I did this, but when I did I realized that I wasn't alone. There were what I can only describe as ghosts floating past me and out through the double glass doors that went out into the hallway. In the hallway, there are giant pillars in front of the ICU doors and at the pillar directly in front of my room there were 6 children, dressed in old fashioned clothes that you would wear to church. They were playing 'Ring around the Rosy'. The 'ghosts' were drifting past the children and into this beautiful amber glow which was on the other side of them. They would then disappear from sight.

I started to step through the door, because I wanted to watch the children and float into the glow. Suddenly I heard a voice behind me. I turned around and there up in the corner of the ceiling was an incredibly beautiful Chinese Dragon. He was azure and lime colored, with every color of the rainbow running down his back. At the same time, as the doctor continued to work on me, I also saw a collie size blood red scorpion walking around and around my bed. The Dragon smiled and told me not to be afraid.  He said he was there to help me and the scorpion was there to protect me. I told him that was fine but that I was going out to the children and into the amber glow. He smiled again, but it was more of a sad smile. He told me I couldn't do that as I wasn't done yet. I said as far as I was concerned I was, and turned to step out the door only to find that I couldn't. I turned and told him it wasn't fair, that I was old, tired and ready to go. He just smiled again and said no, it is not your time. He told me I had many more things to do, and many more miles and mountains before it would be. Then he floated down to where I was and touched the first finger on his right hand to the area of where the third eye is located.

He showed me many things that were to occur. He showed me myself, my children, the world, other worlds and other peoples as like a carefully orchestrated symphony - highs and lows, death and destruction, new life and rebuilding. The exquisite beauty and peace that would ultimately come to pass. He told me until these events were fulfilled it was necessary for me to stay and to help everyone I could in every way that I could. I don't want to go into any great detail about the events and things he showed me, not now any way. He said what he showed me was for me to see and that until I understood everything I had seen it would be best to keep it to myself and that I would know when the time was right to share it. I will say this there is much turmoil to come but also great joy and beauty - great peace. With that, he touched my forehead again, and I was once again in my body. It was two days later.

This wasn't the first time I had seen the Dragon. I had seen him four times previously, although he had never spoken then. I have seen him twice since, although I don't wish to talk about those experiences yet.

Gender:	 Male

Date NDE Occurred:	  I've had 7 NDE's  spanning 56 years

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes  Accident. Illness. Childbirth    Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function or brain function)   The date and time of my death was May 29 2000 at 12:00 pm and I was dead for 43 minutes.   I had been in and out of the hospital for several months prior to this. I was having a badly damaged esophagus and stomach repaired, due to ulcers and erosion. By the time I died doctors had removed a fourth of my esophagus and the top part of my stomach.  I had been extremely ill and in considerable pain for the 2 week period prior to going into the hospital on Thursday May 27 2000. The doctors thought I was having a difficult time adjusting to everything they had done to my insides. In reality, they had missed a large ulcer in my duodenum. It had eaten through the wall and I was slowly bleeding internally. On that date, I was getting ready to go to work and had just stepped out of the shower onto the cold tile floor, and when I did my legs buckled and I fell down. I realized that something was wrong so I crawled into the living room and called the surgeon who was taking care of me. Based on the description I gave to her she knew right away that I was bleeding internally, and told me to get to the hospital immediately. I woke my son who was staying with me at the time and he took me to the hospital a couple of blocks away. The hospital staff took me into the emergency room and did some preliminary tests which showed I was bleeding internally, although they weren't sure where. They put me on whole blood and started running various tests to figure out where the leak was. After doing a scope down my throat, they found the ulcer they had missed. They stabilized me until they could go in the next morning and burn it closed.   On Friday May 28 2000, they cauterized the ulcer. I was told my blood pressure would return to normal and I would feel much better by the following morning, neither of which happened.   On the morning of Saturday May 29 2000, I was a lot worse than I had been before the procedure.  They decided the ulcer had opened back up. At 12:00 pm, they went back in to repair it once again. That is when; as they put it 'all hell broke loose'.

    Experience Description 374  					</p>  					I was floating across the floor, and then stopped at the door to my intensive care room. I turned around and saw the doctors scrambling to save me, after the third injection into my heart, and no response from the paddles, the doctor pronounced me dead.

Above the TV up in the corner was a beautiful Chinese dragon, next to the head of my bed was a crimson red scorpion the size of a collie. I heard some children singing behind me and I could see the reflection of my parents in the dark TV screen.

I turned to see where the singing was coming from; it was coming from outside the door. There were six beautiful children all dressed up playing ring around the rosy, around a large pillar in the hall. Behind them was the most beautiful amber glow, soothing and warm. I realized I wasn't in pain anymore. I felt happy, relieved and at peace. I started to go to the children but I couldn't step through the door.

I turned and looked at the dragon, he smiled and said I wasn't done yet, I still had tasks to perform. I told him like hell, I'm old, tired, and I want to go. He said I couldn't go. The scorpion came over and touched me. The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing what I assume were ghosts walking past me and out through the back wall. I could still see my parents in the dark TV screen. When I was conscious, enough to understand the doctor said I had been gone for forty minutes. And that they weren't the ones who saved me. And, since I wasn't religious in their context, it was probably hard for me to understand. 

They gave me two and half transfusions of blood. Then I began healing at a rate that greatly alarmed the doctors. After twelve days they sent me home to recover.
