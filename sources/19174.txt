forget everything you know
about conventional wisdom
if you&#39;ve studied the ufo subject but
also
what you know about conventional science
because they&#39;re both antiquated what i
want to do is share
what i think you and the public need to
know to understand
what has been called the phenomenon meta
phenomenon
of et contact and uh
ufo phenomenon they&#39;re moving at a
hundred thousand
miles per hour and can make a right-hand
turn without decelerating
and not kill the pilots on board with
you know a thousand g-forces or whatever
that would be
because kind of begs the question of
if they&#39;re interstellar how they get
here
and the fact that they&#39;re here a priori
they use something that&#39;s beyond
even post-quantum physics
and is a little bit like going back to
thomas jefferson&#39;s era
only a couple hundred years ago and
showing
him this thing a smartphone
there would be no foundation for
understanding this this would be
metaphysical
so to the new age people they said well
it&#39;s a metaphysical thing
why is all the metal is meta what matter
what
metaphysical is just a term that people
use when they don&#39;t quite
understand the science of a phenomenon
that&#39;s occurring
isn&#39;t metaphysical
so if you&#39;re an advanced civilization
that&#39;s interstellar
by definition you&#39;re trans dimensional
these technologies that are interstellar
are operating from a level of an
understanding of the cosmos in reality
that is one where consciousness and the
mind
is present at every level
