so this uh for the next hour what i want
to do is share
a couple of techniques i&#39;m going to
first share a breathing technique that&#39;s
a zen buddhist reflecting mindfulness
technique
and this technique it can be used at any
time
before or during the meditation i&#39;m
going to teach you which is using the
sacred
mantras
and this particular mantra is something
you really need to understand
how it came about
the ceremony i&#39;m going to do which i got
accused once of doing
as if it&#39;s any accusation a hindu
ceremony actually it&#39;s not it predates
hinduism buddhism christianity it&#39;s an
ancient philosophical school
the whole ceremony is in sanskrit so you
won&#39;t understand it unless you speak
sanskrit
and when i was
in my misspent youth
before i became a doctor
when other folks were
doing drugs and rock and roll and
chasing skirts i was in becoming a
meditation teacher and spending eight
hours a day in meditation and
um so when i was 19 20 i became a
teacher of meditation
and be
became a deep student of the vedas
as well as other traditions um native
american
enchanting
et cetera um
and this particular ceremony is
beautiful because
it&#39;s all in sanskrit which is a name in
form language
which means that the words the the
resonant tonality of the words
form and create the reality
and it&#39;s thought to be
the root of all indo-european languages
by most linguists and language experts
and
you don&#39;t have to understand the words
because really even though they do have
meaning
it&#39;s more important to hear the resonant
frequency of it
so in a sense this puja which is maybe
15 minutes i don&#39;t know i&#39;ve never timed
it is almost it&#39;s like one long mantra
at the end of which i will actually give
you this mantra you can meditate with
then the mantra i&#39;m going to give you
and this is separate from the meditation
the the breathing technique the mantra
is actually
different from what i initially learned
it&#39;s an advanced technique
and about seven or eight about eight
years ago eight and a half years ago
i was in creston colorado
and you know i had been learned teaching
and sharing this mantra for
40 years almost
30 some years
and
oh i&#39;m dating myself am i that old i
guess i am
and
this was a profound experience where
uh i was we were in the zen meditation
dome up in crest stone up in the sangre
de cristo mountains and i went into this
deep meditation and i led the group into
the higher states of consciousness
from
deep transcendent consciousness
and pure mind samadhi
to cosmic consciousness god
consciousness the united states unity
consciousness brahman consciousness all
the way through
and it was really deep and people had
this amazing experience with it
and then afterwards i went back to my
condo to do the meditation privately
before we went out under the stars till
three a.m
and he imagined doing this for a whole
week pretty cool huh
and i went into this deep state and i
went
straight into the samadhi state
and as i emerged from the samadhi state
i don&#39;t know how much time longer
i went into
the the point where
the quiet and unbounded field of
consciousness
becomes the first fine relative
aspect of creation
and at that juncture i heard this tone
and it was musical and it was three
notes
and it was emerging out of this pure
conscious field as the an early
emanation
of resonant vibration and it&#39;s the
mantra i&#39;m going to give you
and it and it was a mantra that i&#39;ve
known for years and i realized that
it was it&#39;s the correct mantra in terms
of
how it sounds
except that the tonality over the last
few thousand years had been lost now
what i mean by that it&#39;s three syllables
and the way it had been taught to me and
has been for a long time was dun dun dun
like all on a line
when in reality as it emerged from this
field of consciousness it was
the first syllable is a perfect fifth
higher than the other two
now i&#39;m not a musician and i certainly
don&#39;t sing well
but that&#39;s what i heard it was a perfect
fifth higher than the other two and so
when you
repeat and think the mantra you need to
understand that that&#39;s the correct
use of it and i didn&#39;t know that until
2007.
it was effective without this knowledge
but with this knowledge it became
enormously more effective
so
this is the beginning of you sort of
being you know
entering into this knowledge tonight
as we go through the weekend i will add
other advanced techniques with this
mantra
because this mantra
because it is in this
tonality
actually
creates also
a sort of triangular form
and as opposed to a straight line
so there&#39;s a geometric form that emerges
from the tonality does this make sense
to people
and you have to understand a triangle is
the first
shape that encloses space
and for manifestation and if you put a
triangle
into 3d
you have a tetrahedron
then if you put the tetrahedron
and
replicate it and join it at the base and
merge them halfway between each other
you end up with a merkabah
which unfortunately i don&#39;t have a big
one this
looks spherical it&#39;s an eight-pointed
star and it&#39;s a merkabah
or a double tetrahedron very sacred
and i&#39;m going to first teach you just to
meditate with the mantra
and then if we have time over the
weekend
i will
teach you how to create
a
form from the mantra america from the
mantra and create a conscious astral
uh interstellar vehicle to travel in in
consciousness with the merkabah
does this make sense to people
yeah okay so that&#39;s all what happened on
that 2007 expedition into the wilderness
in colorado
so that&#39;s what i&#39;ll be sharing
now most people meditate incorrectly
because they&#39;re trying too hard
it should really be fun and easy people
get so serious and it&#39;s like mantra
mantra mantra mantra you know they&#39;re
forcing it no that&#39;s not how you
meditate
so
what you really want to understand is
the the proper use of any meditative
technique
and i&#39;m not chauvinistic about this in
fact you know i&#39;m sharing you techniques
and i actually there are dozens of
techniques i could share if we had a
whole week together
or two weeks or a month
but i&#39;m going to share you have to start
somewhere right so i&#39;m going to share
the this breathing technique which is
great to use just before you begin the
mantra
why because the resonance of the breath
the prana the chi
going in and out is very soothing in
awakening and enlivening
and then if you introduce the mantra
after having done the breathing
meditation
you&#39;re already in a deeper and quieter
state of mind
does this make sense
so that&#39;s a really powerful way of
putting those two together which is what
we&#39;re going to do
now
when you&#39;re using the mantra
instead of trying to force it
remember what they said
and this is something that you know
jerry was talking to me about in
colorado uh
the
difference between force and just power
if you&#39;re forcing it it&#39;s actually
counterproductive
but if it&#39;s being emerging from within
in a relaxed way
and your mind is just going and
lightly focused on the mantra
you can then let your mind settle on it
where you become more and more aware of
the conscious mind that&#39;s
thinking the mantra and if you practice
this for enough months and years the
mantra runs by itself and you just allow
it to be something the mind gently
connects to and you enter into this deep
quiet pure state of mind
your blood pressure goes down all this
happening amazing things happen
you become very centered and calm
the key is not to try to force the
mantra when you&#39;re thinking and you can
think it at any speed or loudness when
you you never speak this mantra you know
you don&#39;t ever give it to utterance i&#39;ll
speak it because otherwise you don&#39;t
know what it is
i&#39;ll speak it and i&#39;ll spell it and i&#39;ll
do the whole thing so you have it
precisely because i want you to have it
precisely
but i&#39;m not going to i&#39;m going to ask
you not to then speak it overtly because
it brings it out into sort of a
coarsening of it you want to keep it as
a
thought sound
it&#39;s it&#39;s and it is it&#39;s the sound
component of thought
and so this particular thought and sound
when used
in a gentle way of lightly focusing
it allows your mind to become centered
calm
and if you find yourself while you&#39;re
using it distracted
which everyone does i don&#39;t care who you
are
by other sounds thoughts perceptions
most people get
irritated their egos and intellect then
try pushing out those stimuli and those
perceptions
which is counterproductive it brings the
mind back to a very superficial level
of again forced
and egotism
and irritation
as opposed to holism and transcendence
into quietness does that make sense
so if you have a sound if you&#39;re
distracted by anything you find you&#39;re
not using the mantra anymore and you&#39;re
off thinking about
uh breakfast or going to bed or whatever
just acknowledge that thought or
perception and then return to the mantra
gently so it&#39;s this back and forth
process that&#39;s gentle as opposed to
forced does this make sense
and it&#39;s and don&#39;t feel like oh i&#39;m not
doing it right because i started
thinking about my cat at home that&#39;s
fine think about your cat at home and
then return to the mantra thinking bit
very gently and you&#39;ll make it
distracted again and you return to it
you just keep returning to it
what&#39;s really key also is that as the
mantra is being focused on lightly
focused gently focused
you become aware of the mind watching
the mantra
same thing with the breath when you&#39;re
doing the breathing meditation and as
you become aware of the mind
allow the mind to to
see the mantra being repeated
but increasingly connect to the mind
watching the mind and let the mantra
just be a soothing tone that allows you
to stay focused on that does this make
sense
it&#39;s a very new it&#39;s like riding a
bicycle the first time you can be a
little but once you learn this it&#39;s
really fantastic
at some point you may find yourself
not having the mantra
and not having
any thoughts and you&#39;re just
aware of the mind
that
is the experience of pure consciousness
it may be very subtle initially and then
eventually it will be something where
you have a deeper and wider and more
infinite experience with it but it may
first be just the experience of the
space between the thoughts and the space
between the perceptions where it&#39;s this
beautiful state of
perfect calmness and awakeness
and yet nothingness
it&#39;s it it is that beatific state
but it can dawn very gently and suddenly
so in a sense any meditation technique
objective is for the technique to stop
and you find yourself in the unbounded
quiet state
so that&#39;s the other art to this is not
to hold on and force the mantra too
strongly because really what your
objective is is allow the mind to
connect to the mantra and then find
yourself in this quiet ocean of
awareness
this is is this
trying to be clear about this to the
extent words convey it
of course experience is the great
teacher and that&#39;s why we want to do
that tonight
each morning i recommend you take half
an hour to an hour to practice the
breathing technique and the meditation
and then in the morning we don&#39;t have a
session so you can play in the pools and
begin to practice remote viewing
tomorrow afternoon we&#39;re going to go
through a whole bunch of techniques for
remote viewing and how the and
description of how it works so you can
take that home with you
but we want to start tonight with giving
you this technique these well two
techniques the breathing and the
the mantra
when we&#39;re doing the the meditation
which will tonight we&#39;ll do maybe a 10
15 minute group meditation
it&#39;s really best to do it before
you&#39;ve had any kind of stimulants
like
coffee or a big meal
so in the morning when you awaken you
know you may want to just wash up and
have a piece of fruit or something and
then meditate but don&#39;t have you know
like a you know a gallon of coffee
because you&#39;re going to get
and same thing in the in the evening you
sort of want to do it when you know
without having
just eaten
it also helps a great deal
if you do it in the same
general time of day to get into your own
rhythm
if you do it two three times and if
you&#39;re at home to do it in the same
place why is that because you actually
create in your own a signature
in space time that&#39;s conscious
that activates the so-called embedded
akashic record that you are writing
and it creates a power spot
and this is why
you can go into places where a great
deal of meditation
or deep spirituality is you can feel it
or you can go someplace and feel where
terrible things have happened and feel
it so it does help if you do it with and
you get into some into a place and you
don&#39;t have to have a meditation room it
can just maybe be a corner of your room
or a place where you do this on a
regular basis and it creates
uh its own deep meditative feeling
that makes it
easier facilitates going into the quiet
meditative state that&#39;s something i
suggest now it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re
traveling i travel 120 000 miles a year
i just do it wherever i am but i&#39;m just
saying if you&#39;re at home it&#39;s great to
to do that
the other thing is you don&#39;t have to be
in a
sound deprivation chamber to do this
you can be sitting on a subway and do it
once you practice it enough where you&#39;re
going into quiet awareness
but the key is don&#39;t let the
distractions of the sound be something
you&#39;re fighting if you&#39;re getting into a
tug of war
with thoughts and sounds and perceptions
and what have you
then you&#39;re tied up on that level of the
superficial mind and the monkey mind
the intellect
if you&#39;re wanting to go into
transcendent unbounded consciousness
it&#39;s you really have to let go of all
that
and just let it flow
and don&#39;t be irritated by it in fact
what i&#39;ve learned to do
very good technique is as soon as
there&#39;s a stimulus
that is moving you out of the meditative
state
allow you the whatever the perception is
to remind you that you&#39;re conscious
and the awake mind is perceiving that
stimulus even if it&#39;s someone screaming
at the top of their lungs does this make
sense so you&#39;re then reconnecting
to the quiet
mind that is the singularity
even as you&#39;re perceiving the
distraction
in this sense if you learn doing to do
that your whole life becomes awake
dreaming
sleeping
a continuous meditative state
because you become
accustomed to letting anything that&#39;s
happening be an opportunity
to connect to how it is you&#39;re
perceiving it
and that is you&#39;re just perceiving it
because you&#39;re conscious
and that consciousness
is always within you
and if you you look at it that way then
whatever is is uh a sten
a perception or or pulling you out of
what your your practice is it&#39;s not
something that&#39;s a barrier at all it
just becomes something that enables you
to become aware of it become where the
mind has been
perceiving it and then return to the
meditation technique to go more deeply
into
quietness
a lot of it is attitudinal
what is your attitude towards things
that most people would say i&#39;m being
distracted by this thought or this sound
so i&#39;m trying to say don&#39;t take an
oppositional attitude take a relaxed
integrative
accepting attitude
and uh just relax and enjoy it
does that does that make for people
understand this is a
it&#39;s a it&#39;s nuanced it&#39;s subtle
so what i want to do first is to to help
folks center is give you this breathing
technique and
this is actually a zen
buddhist
technique
and jack cornfield and others have
shared that is a beautiful approach and
it actually is for mindfulness
meditation
so if you can sit
and put things out of your lap and just
relax
and let&#39;s close our eyes
and let us sit quietly together
and as we sit quietly
let us breathe in deeply with our nose
and exhale with our mouth
very deeply with our nose
and exhale with our mouth
and keep doing this and as you breathe
in with your nose
see energy
chi prana
filling your body and awakening
the mind
and it is building like you are charging
the light of consciousness within and in
your third eye
you see that your conscious mind is
expanding and awakening as you breathe
and that breath is going through every
cell of your body from your toes to your
head carrying this light
and energy of the life force prana
chi
conscious breath
and then as you exhale
relax and release into the breath of
mother earth
all of your concerns and limitations
and with each inward breath you are more
awake
and enlivened
and with each exhalation
you become relaxed
and centered
and you let go of all limitations
all concerns
and feel peace within
so let us do this for a couple more
moments
oh
now very gently begin to breathe
normally
but continue to watch the breath
and with each inward breath
and outward breath
you become awakened
and relaxed
centered and calm
and now very gently become aware of the
mind
watching the breath
see that you are conscious
and this consciousness
changeless
watching the breath
hearing the sounds
seeing the self
your individuality
but this field of consciousness
doesn&#39;t change
it is a steady field
of pure
undifferentiated awake mind
and the breath comes and goes
and sounds come and go
thoughts arise and fall
and pass through us
but our true self is this quiet
pure mind
that is in fact changeless
that perceives all
and yet is bound by none
so all that we perceive
including our own individual selves
are permeated by this infinite light of
consciousness
this field that is unbounded
and unlimited in space or time
and that is always shining within each
of us
and in fact within all things
so let us quietly go into this ocean of
unbounded mind
and let us dive into its quietness
we perceive our breath now
as if from afar
and we are deep in this quiet and
infinite space watching the breath
perceiving our bodies
our thoughts
and now we sense that every person in
this room
is awake
and the awakeness
the essence of the mind
is in fact
one it is a singularity
and we can feel and sense
the calmness
of perceiving reality from this unitive
state
quiet within
and the light of consciousness now we
realize
is infinite
like the depths
of an infinite ocean
silent
calm
and on the surface of this ocean are
many waves and ripples
that emerge in relativity
but at the heart of this infinite ocean
of consciousness
is this centered quiet
place
of the placeless
pure awake mind
and thus in this state
as we
shortly will introduce the mantra
you can then go more deeply into this
quiet field
until all things
vanish
and the perception
is only of consciousness itself
the mind
enfolded watching the mind
and it is pure joy and bliss
freedom
infinite peace
a state of great repose and beauty
that is beyond space time
matter or even individual self
and this is our true self
um
so now
let us
slowly open our eyes
and even though we have been
in infinity together
affirm to yourself you can remain in
this state of quiet
infinite awareness
or a sense of it
as you open your eyes and look around
and realize
that all that you perceive in reality
is pure consciousness
resonating as space and time
matter this room your body
and that is the truth
all of this is that
so that&#39;s a relaxing and centering
breathing meditation you can use that
for five ten twenty minutes as whatever
you feel comfortable
and then you can then go into
introducing the mantra
either within that state
or you can do that as a meta standalone
meditation it&#39;s very powerful
everybody understand that process
starting out deep breathing in and out
in with the nose out with the mouth
inwardly you&#39;re energizing and
visualizing the prana the chi the life
force that is within breath
going deep within yourself and your
exhalations
you center
and become calm and release each breath
you&#39;re releasing and going deeper and
deeper and deeper and deeper into the
calm state and we&#39;re letting go
of your limitations and concerns and
becoming more relaxed and you just keep
doing this with each breath each breath
of your life then becomes a meditation
that you can be aware of
so that mindfulness meditation using the
breath is a very ancient technique and
there are literally hundreds of
what are called pranayama
techniques using the breath and prana
and um if we have time this weekend i&#39;ll
teach you another one that&#39;s also very
effective
everybody understand that one
okay so what we&#39;re going to do now is
stand and
we&#39;re gonna do a puja it&#39;s traditional
to stand i&#39;m gonna take my shoes off you
don&#39;t have to but it&#39;s
boy these boots
i&#39;ve had these for 50 years i love them
because they have the akashic record of
every place i&#39;ve been
the pentagon the cia
interstellar reality so if you&#39;d like to
come forward
so this this ceremony is a very
beautiful um
melodic
uh
ceremony that brings pure consciousness
into this dimension and is a blessing
and it&#39;s actually a um
in a sense an invocation
to connect to that divine state within
all of us but it&#39;s also an honoring of
the tradition
of enlightened beings that have brought
the knowledge of consciousness to earth
for millions of years all the way back
to the interstellars
and i personally think
that the sanskrit
and this tradition is the remnants of
the last golden
era on earth which had open and
continuous contact
with
interstellar civilizations
that were highly enlightened
that&#39;s my own experience with it um so
uh
we&#39;ll have an assistant here come on up
you can take
uh
this can come off this vivitec whatever
this is it was
just so the the people running this
during the breaks we were going to have
video and before people before we start
our lecture and it didn&#39;t get done but
we&#39;ll do it uh next time
so i will just sort of briefly brief you
on
there are things that i&#39;m these are the
ascended masters there there&#39;s rice and
water and sandalwood paste flowers
camphor
candles light
and it&#39;s all very traditional and
there&#39;s a lot of symbology
but don&#39;t concern yourself i&#39;ll do this
puja
and
you can just
you can have it do it with your eyes
open or closed you can watch or not
watch it doesn&#39;t matter but get into the
feeling of the resonance of the sanskrit
tonality and the words and the chanting
and and you&#39;ll be able to understand so
i don&#39;t know if a technician wants to
set up this thing so
uh the technical folks
hello
this stand needs to be here so i can put
i can&#39;t do the push and hold this
remember
or
well we had a discussion earlier but it
was forgotten
but
hopefully someone will appear
oh good someone has materialized
you know it&#39;s funny i&#39;m very uh i like
going through that
i don&#39;t know here put it and see
you tell me
i can&#39;t touch it because i have to do
all this
can folks hear oh
is that good
can folks hear me
oh good wonderful
i&#39;m not turning my back to you to be
rude but you&#39;re we&#39;re all facing the uh
the ascended masters and honoring them
now after this puja you can be seated
and i will you&#39;ll have to close your
eyes and i&#39;ll share the mantra
that i was describing earlier
okay
so
so if you want to be here
and you&#39;ll probably have to hold it so i
can see it
no it&#39;s way too far
i do not need reading glasses so it
needs to be like in that distance okay
all right so i&#39;m going to light
hopefully there are no fire
detectors right nearby
or smoke detectors this is incense
the sandalwood incense is the
traditional in this fun i love doing
this out in the wilderness
but we&#39;ll do it in here tonight
oh this somebody had the orion
transmission sphere the crystal do you
still have it
i gave it to somebody
it was
somebody absconded
thank you
i
there are some things i put on here that
are not traditional but i don&#39;t think
the master&#39;s mind
and if they do they&#39;ll get over it
okay
all right so let us
center ourselves in the quiet state
and be grateful for the life we have
and this puja is dedicated to opening
the era of universal peace
apavitra pavitrova
a
foreign
arctic yum
nama
um
now let us be seated in silent
meditation
so
let us close our eyes
with our minds enlivened with the
sacredness
of the ancient puja
let us take some deep cleansing breath
again in with our nose and out with our
mouth
and so we connect back to that quiet
place within
and now as we breathe normally watching
the breath
we connect to the awake mind
watching the breath
hearing the sounds
perceiving ourself
and our thoughts
and we affirm that that conscious mind
is infinite
unbounded
a field of endless pure consciousness
and that is the nature of our very own
consciousness always
being thus reminded of our true nature
we listen as i share the mantra
which consists of three syllables
and the first syllable is a perfect
fifth
higher in tonality than the other two
and we always just think this mantra
gently
and allowing it to be
a focus
without straining or force
so the mind becomes centered
and pure
and quiet and calm
and so listen carefully as i repeat the
mantra
the first syllable is i am m as in
mother
i&#39;m
the second syllable is na
in as in nancy
a
the third syllable is ma
m as in mother
a h
and the first syllable is the perfect
fifth
higher in tonality
than the other two
and so think it quietly
without speaking it
as i repeat it over and over again just
follow it in your thought
i&#39;m not
i&#39;m
now think it more gently and softly
and so now
allow yourself just to think the mantra
without straining just repeating it at
any speed
any
loudness in thought
softly
whatever it spontaneously feels
comfortable
and as you think the mantra
become aware of the mind that is
watching it
and because of the tonality
see that it is like a musical note
that can just repeat over and over and
over effortlessly
and the tonality
like a tone
or a note of music
just repeats over and over
and that allows the mind to be centered
and calm
as it takes you deeper and deeper into
quiet
the unbounded
the ocean
of pure
consciousness
if at any point you become distracted
with thoughts or sounds
do not fight them just return
to thinking the mantra
and observing the mind watching the
mantra
as you go more and more deeply into
quietness and peace
until you just let go
of all perceptions
and enter into the unbounded
transcendent state
a pure consciousness
so let us sit together in silence
and practice this for a few moments
do
okay
so
now
while remaining in this quiet space
allow the mantra
to transform
into a tetrahedron
and each time you repeat the mantra
a triangle is formed
i&#39;m not
and this three-sided triangle with a
triangular base
is a tetrahedron
and see that it is golden
shimmering
awake
it is a consciousness created
astral
spacecraft
and then as we repeat the mantra three
more times we create another
tetrahedron with the point facing
downward
or opposite
of the first one
i&#39;m not
and let us rotate that one
and put it halfway
within the first
tetrahedron
and we see
an eight-pointed
spherical
merkabah
a double imposed
tetrahedron
and we center our consciousness within
the very center
double tetrahedron
and we empower it with pure
cosmic consciousness
and we visualize it in the center of our
forehead expanding
and in inner space
it expands
to any size we wish it to be
and we travel within
the resonant field
of this sacred form
created by the tonality of the mantra
and so we expand our awareness
with this mantra
and the merkabah
and we rise upward
through the ceiling
of this room
and we effortlessly gaze
at this hotel with all of us in it
meditating
and then we go upward into the sky
above mother earth
and we see the beauty of the valley
scintillating in the darkness of night
and we see to our east
the vast wilderness of joshua tree
national park
and to our west
over the mountains
the large cities of los angeles
and orange county
and san diego
and as we go upward we behold father sky
embracing mother earth
who is conscious and awake
and as we rise upward
a few hundred thousand feet
we see the earth
this beautiful blue sphere
floating in space and we see it with
celestial perception
the astral body of earth
and we spent sense
her love for us
and our love for her
the life she gives us
and she is a conscious being albeit not
human
and she is asking us
for her help
to lift the burden we have placed upon
her
and we answer that we shall
and as we gaze outward now into space
we see
the vastness
of the cosmos
and effortlessly we rise upward and go
out past the moon
and on the other side of the moon that
is lit
are vast extraterrestrial spacecraft
that are present
many miles across
and we welcome them here to assist us
in the mission
to planet earth
and humanity for its healing and
enlightenment
and as we expand our awareness further
traveling in the sacred merkabah
we see the other planets of the solar
system
and out by the rings of saturn
an enormous interstellar facility
and we
welcome them
to enter this meditation with us
as we bless the earth and her children
and see a time
expanding into the future for half a
million years
of unbroken universal peace
and
enlightenment and harmony on earth
and in space
and as we expand our merkabah and our
awareness further
effortlessly we go out of our solar
system
and our sun
and the earth are specks in the distance
and we behold the vastness of
interstellar space
which like all points in space and time
are filled
with this pure consciousness
and it is not empty
but it is teeming with awareness
and other dimensions folded within
every point of space and time
into the worlds of light
and astral splendor
and thought
and the imperial realm of knowledge and
ideas
and thence into infinity
and so now we behold the beautiful milky
way
as we go beyond the milky way galaxy
and we see a spiral galaxy
which we call the milky way
with about a hundred billion star
systems
and there are billions of intense
living
present
civilizations just in this galaxy
and we see the intensity of their light
and feel their consciousness
and just as we sense the awareness of
earth
we sense the awareness of these
civilizations
and we see we are one in pure
consciousness with them
and as we go further into intergalactic
space
we apprehend
the consciousness
of the galactic being
for the galaxy has an aggregate
consciousness
and we sense it and are awestruck
and then as we travel further
and to enter galactic space
we perceive the andromeda galaxy 2.5
million years from earth
light years from earth
and it is like a twin galaxy to the
milky way
and it too has billions of civilizations
awake
and we sense
the consciousness
that infinite fractal
manifesting life
and then we expand
and behold the entirety
of the cosmos which has no beginning in
time
or space
and even the material cosmos is in fact
infinite
and where what we perceive as one
universe let self
there is vastness of space
and other universes
begin
and it has no limit in space or time
and then we transcend
space and time and galaxies
and perceive
the worlds of astral splendor
and we see that those worlds
are peopled
with light beings
beyond space and time and matter
and it too is an infinite cosmos
folded within
consciousness
and so it goes on forever
into the cosmos
of pure thought forms
and piercing the form of all light
the emanation of the primal light
the first light
of existence
we perceive the primal tone
emanating from unbounded pure
consciousness
and this primal thought
has folded within it
the resonant tone and frequency of all
that exists
all that will exist
all that has existed
in a most beautiful tone
and this is the song
of the cosmos
and then we realize
that all of this
every galaxy and every star
every dimension
and every realm
is folded within the pure consciousness
that is within
each of us
indivisible and in its totality
and we are filled with joy
as we perceive this knowledge
and in this state
as emissaries in consciousness
together
we scan
the universe
and as we see worlds and people
and starships
whatever comes into our mind
we accept
and we sense their light of awareness
and we see that they are conscious even
as we are
and in that light of consciousness
we see the foundation of universal peace
and we invite them to join us in this
meditation
and guide them to earth
and so
we show them
our home planet
and our star the sun
on one of the outer spiral arms of the
milky way galaxy
and as we zoom into our solar system
effortlessly
in our beautiful mirkaba of light
we show them earth
a conscious living being
and we ask them to join us
as we
see the earth bathe in healing light
and comfort
and compassion
and love
and then we sense the seven billion
children of earth
and all her creatures
plants and animals
and we send the light of this cosmic
light
into each and every heart
and all the life of the earth
and we ask the great being
to guide humanity
and no matter how powerful
or how humble
every heart and consciousness on earth
is filled with this vision and a new
light
a beautiful
vision of a new civilization on earth
and we ask these interstellar
civilizations
as well as these supernal and celestial
realms
to join us here
and we guide them to this place
and as we draw closer to the earth
we show them
the west coast
or wherever you are
via the internet wherever you live
and we show them the valley
where palm springs and desert hot
springs is
located and then we show them this hotel
and we show them this room
and we ask them to be here in any way in
any form
that is safe and appropriate
for this time and place
and invite them into our dream time
to communicate with us
that we may soar in the firmament of
consciousness
as easily as we do across the skies
and ask them
to be with us
as ambassadors in consciousness
and in body and self
to their civilizations
and we do this for the purpose
of awakening
this knowledge within all of
humanity that the time of universal
peace has arrived
and the dawning of a new civilization
based on justice
and on truth
and enlightenment
and abundance
and peace
and in this spirit we ask all of these
civilizations
to join us
as they prepare and we prepare
for this cosmic moment
long foretold
by all the ancient seers
and wise ones on earth
