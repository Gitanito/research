 1/1, July 16, 1880.  Incorporated Lambelle's  monthly Spiritual Pioneer.  The journal regularly  had articles by William Oxley, including, in the  issue for November 5, 1880, "Occultism and  Adeptship" on H.P. Blavatsky's mysterious  uncovering of a needed cup and saucer under a  deodhar tree on a "pic-nic."  The journal was in  financial difficulties from the first.  The  Psychological Review in March 1882 noted that the  spiritualists' convention organized to support  the journal exclusively ended "under a dense  cloud of uncertainty and humiliation."
