  		              		Experience Description   

  I just got back into motorcycle riding and bought a Honda VFR1200F motorcycle.  When leaving the parking lot at work, I gave the motorcycle way too much power. The back wheel spun and I was thrown off the  bike. I remember hearing the revving of the engine, and then I had this experience. After the experience, I was thrown off the bike and my body was slammed on the ground.

  Just after hearing the engine rev up very loudly, I was instantly 'teleported' to a desert. The ground was sandy but solid, and I could smell the desert air. I've done military service in Kuwait, Qatar and Afghanistan so I know what it smells like. It was hot, but I felt  a cool breeze.  In front of me was a rocky outcrop or cliff face that extended from the ground to about 20 feet high. On the top, there was a desert tree with no foliage and it looked dry as you would expect.

  The sky pulsed quickly from a sky blue to a deep purple and then back again. It was as if the days were speedily passing by. The bright daylight on the cliff face stayed exactly the same.  I was aware of something observing me, but didn't see anything. I was in awe at the sky, but was slightly fearful at the fact that I was in a desert. I had a sense of dullness and indifference as well.

  I then got snapped back to reality as I was  thrown from my bike and hit the ground. I was helped up by work colleagues and they moved my bike for me.

  I went to the hospital the next day for a neck x-ray, but this terrible person made me wait for 2 hours before telling me they don't do x-rays. So, I went to work. I felt sick and  had a sore neck and shoulder for a few weeks.  I think I very nearly broke my next, but my helmet saved my life.
