  		    5048.    Elena D Probable NDE     6/20/2022.      Probable NDE 9412.       From the UK.  Experience happened in Bulgaria.     The place was dark-blue, and simultaneously light, a kind of 'bright darkness'. Conversations without words with creatures that resembled a cloud orb. A feeeling for a different type of communication - the knowledge arrives at you without a specific time at which the communication is taking place. This feeling is actually my brightest recollection. Also, a feeling for good intentions. I have no memory of how I arrived in this place. I was given a choice. I could return to the Earth, with the knowledge that I will travel in the future with a man who I later married and divorced.  
  Probable NDE during one year hospitalization after surgery to remove all intestines.   

  5047.    Erin Q NDE     6/9/2022.      NDE 9411.       From Canada.     Then I was launched warp-speed out of the dark tunnel. I fell out of the tunnel, hundreds of feet in the sky.  I was a flying spirit/soul, without a body. I felt pure bliss. I was in nature, and flying up the valley.  The mountains and nature were so beautiful. I saw colors and felt love on a much bigger scale than what we can on earth. While flying, I looked down and saw a small female child who was running down the mountain, away from me. In a split second, I knew she was my child. 
  NDE due to suffocation from a criminal attack.   

    5046.    Random H Possible NDE     6/6/2022.      Possible NDE;STE 9408.            I was in a more purified state, and I suddenly had the most intense epiphany. It was the epiphany or realization that there is No "I" except God, that "I" myself am illusory and am merely a single ray of light shining out from God out of a multiplicity, and that I don't ultimately exist at the highest level of reality, only God does. It was essentially a realization of non-duality, that everything except God is ultimately illusory, including all souls.  
  STE as possible NDE at night associated with heart attack symptoms.   

    5045.    Jennifer M Probable NDE     6/6/2022.      Probable NDE 9407.            I could see off in the far distance a super white yellowish goldish very bright light far off to the right of me and I knew that could possibly be where Angels or heaven was but I seem to be suspended in this certain spot and I was being spoken to telepathically there wasn’t really a sense of physical body and Told that I was awaiting a decision  
  Probable NDE due to sepsis after back surgery.   

    5044.    Kelly R FDE     6/6/2022.      FDE 9410.            I leaned back in my seat, closed my eyes, let my body go, and said God please don’t let me die. It honestly felt like a reflex, I can’t explain it it’s like my body knew what to do. I can still feel the way my body jerked around the car like it was a literal rag doll.  
  FDE at time of car being struck by semi truck.   

    5043.    Byun SS NDE     6/6/2022.      NDE 9409.       Exceptional Non-Western NDE from Korea.  Original in Korean, translated to English by Teresa.     When I arrived, this color like of a baby chick, encompassed me with feelings of extreme peace and I conversed with an existence that I could not see and talked with feelings of thought and felt the answers. I knew there was an existence, a being, that was in the distance but could not see. I had no physical body, I just existed inside extreme peace with great sounding music coming from somewhere.  Suddenly, I remembered my siblings and thought of wanting to see them, and as soon as I thought this I was with my siblings in our hut and while looking at their faces, I felt nothing. As soon as I thought of a place I was instantaneously there, and while listening to the stories inside the bright light, I felt and realized that it was love.  
  NDE due to fall, and returned to consciousness while in the morgue.   

    5042.    Fabio STE     5/29/2022.      STE 9404.       From Brazil.  Original in Portuguese, translated to English by Antonio.     Then I realized who I was with. The Creator of the Universe himself. Immediately when this realization came to me I dropped to the ground. My body, soul and spirit went into shock and I started to cry horribly. My soul was on fire and I felt that at any moment it could be completely burned by the sheer power of God. My body felt it too because when I woke up my parents told me they tried to wake me up but they couldn't because my body was screaming. At that moment, Jesus put His hand on my shoulder and said, "Do not be afraid."  
  STE dream as a child with encounter with Jesus.   

            5041.    Michael Z NDE     5/26/2022.      NDE 9403.       From Germany.  Original in German, translated to German by Marguy.     Never before in my life did I have this kind of feeling. It was a downright excessive feeling of safety and security, stronger than any hug when I was a child. It felt like: Love, warmth, security, safety, well-being, relaxation, welcome....everything that you had already experienced in life, but altogether at once. In front of myself, in a certain distance I saw a bright, round light 'window' wherein you could see something green and rainbow colored. I was surrounded by figures/people that I didn't see, but I could very distinctly feel how they softly put their hands on me and were guiding me.  
  NDE due to apparent faint with loss of consciousness.   

    5040.    Monique M Probable FDE     5/25/2022.      Probable FDE;Possible NDE 9402.              Then I felt peaceful. Everything was black and I got a sudden rush of all the memories in my life in a warm amber hue tone. Almost like I was watching it but not watching it - it just was in my mind but it was clear.
  Probable fear-death experience vs possible NDE at age 11 due to near drowning.   

    5039.    Lily Probable FDE     5/25/2022.      Probable FDE 9401.            Then, there was a brief blackness before seeing myself covered in sparkly gold lights moving all over my body yet I could not move any part of my body. I felt as if I was jutted toward the driver, yet my body was stuck in sitting position. It was surreal to see, but it was oddly relaxing. Then, there was another void before I opened my eyes like normal.  
  Probable fear-death experience at time of near truck crash.  Experience shared a few days after its occurrence.   

    5038.    Edita M NDE     5/20/2022.      NDE 9398.       From the Netherlands.  Original in Dutch, translated to English by Garry.     I was guided further upward and saw an explosion of colors, my peeping sound continued and while I was watching the explosion of colors slow music came from all directions. I could also see and feel everything around me at once. The music became steadily clearer and I thought, what sort of music is this, it was namely, classical music. As a child I never listened to it. I got to hear that my tone frequency is part of the rest and that we together produce different music in the Universe each time. My Protector was still present and assured me that my next trip would contain a bit less light but would be safe.  
  NDE at age 12 due to drowning. She was in a Muslim family at the time.   

    5037.    Catherine S NDE-like     5/14/2022.      NDE-like;OBE 9396.       From Canada     I found myself in this most beautiful landscape. There was a river on my left. I was on a path beside the river and to my right was a thick forest. The scene on the other side of the river was identical. The colors were all shades and tints of a beautiful blue. I was walking along side a being in a hooded cloak. I couldn’t see their face but we were walking arm in arm. There was an overwhelming feeling of pure love and peacefulness. We did not speak using voice but telepathically. I don’t remember hearing any words but the sense I got was that everything would be alright.  
  NDE-like OBE.  Experience occurred at age 14 and shared 55 years later.   

      5036.    Amanda G NDE     5/14/2022.      NDE 9395.       From Australia     I look towards the ceiling, in corner of the room. I saw a white light getting brighter and larger. The being approaches me and I drift away to it and towards the waiting room. I watch my husband pacing up and down. I know that he needs me so much and because of that, I can't leave. The being follows me and then proceeds to guide me away from the waiting room. We go back into the room where my body and the medical team are all still going frantic about their work. The being guides me towards the bright light and what appears to be a tunnel.
  NDE due to complication of epidural anesthesia for delivery.

    5034.    Sam P NDE     5/14/2022.      NDE 9392.            As I crossed into this white, warm light I was received into a room of pure light. I was laying on a table in this room surrounded by 7 or more beings that were very tall, slender, and their appearance was of shadows within an aura of bright light. There was one being who held an orb of what looked like liquid gold light that was dripping, and contained geometric patterns.  
  NDE associated with rapid heartbeat leading to unconsciousness multiple times.  Multiple brief beginnings of an NDE, then a more detailed NDE.  Shared about three weeks after experience.   

    5033.    Jose G Probable NDE     5/13/2022.      Probable NDE 9397.       From Spain.  Original in Spanish. Translated to English by Camille.     I felt mentally in an empty space but with a dense atmosphere and an awareness of a much higher reality than my earthly reality. The well-being was totally ineffable. I immediately understood the truth. I told myself during the experience, that it was the truth that I had been searching for so long.   
  Probable NDE during surgery with anesthesia.   

          5032.    Douglas C NDE     5/4/2022.      NDE 9389.            I could sense it's power, and the size of was HUGE. The only way I can equate it is seeing yourself in front of a high rise and it coming directly at you. I said to myself "What is this?" and I leaned back to try to avoid it. This was the only time I felt fear. I was not scared of the presence, but because I thought to myself "What am I doing wrong that doesn't allow me to get into heaven?"  
  NDE due to seizure of unknown cause.  Experience shared about one week after it occurred.   

    5031.    Rick H NDE     5/3/2022.      NDE 9386.       From Canada     I looked down and felt I was a large golden cloud moving thru the ceiling. I looked up and saw a beautiful blue sky and felt a very, very old timeless feeling. It was a great sensation. There was also the realization that I have been here before. I did not see anyone, but felt the warmth of love around me. At this point I could see 360 degrees and thought nothing of it. I also had this thought that everything 'down there' was make-believe, and everything up here was the real deal.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest during surgery.   

          5030.    Thomas Z NDE     4/22/2022.      NDE 9382.            I could hear a swooshing noise and I could see a lot of stars and the blackness of space. There was also a bright, green line stretching from as far as I could see to my left and to my right. While wondering which way to go, I was slowly drifting to the left so I went to the left. It didn't take me very long and I was in front of a tunnel. The green line covered the tunnel with what appeared to be a door.
  NDE due to passing out during medical procedure.   

    5029.    Dave C NDE     4/12/2022.      NDE and Others 9380.       From the United Kingdom.     I remember being above my body, but still in the car, fully conscious of all around and with no fear, this kept me in good stead for future experiences.

    5028.    Lisette SL Probable NDE     4/12/2022.      Probable NDE 9378.            I felt only Love and joy and wanted to stay there. I felt entirely peaceful where I was in whatever state of consciousness that was outside of space and outside of time. I had the ability to know the future, then was offered a choice by the Presence (God?) to return to this state of consciousness in which we live on Earth. I remember not wanting to come back but knowing that I needed to in order to raise the child I had been giving birth to when I left my body.  
  Probable NDE at time of urgent caesarian section.   

    5027.    Steffan H NDE     4/12/2022.      NDE 16126.            After the tunnel, I was all of a sudden in the most beautiful blue water I’d ever seen. I describe it like a coloring-book blue. A shade of blue that only a child might know such as the last time I played with crayons. On each side was grass that was just as beautifully colored as the water. There were people lined up on both sides, though I didn’t pay attention to them much, I’ll never forget the smiles and the love I felt radiating from every direction, especially right in front of me.   
  NDE from being shot 7 times.   

    5026.    Donna May S NDE/FDE     4/8/2022.      NDE and FDE 9377.            Then my mom was in front of me, in her pretty pink top, silver hair, white shorts.  She didn’t say a word to me.  She just kept venturing to me, waving her hands toward herself as if to say, Come to me.  I screwed at her in my mind, I can’t, Mom.  I have to stay here with Nate!  The issue is - my mom had passed the May prior.  She was not among the living anymore.  
  NDE due to strangulation by former husband. Fear-death experience described later in account.   

    5025.    Tawny S NDE     3/31/2022.      NDE 9373.            I saw the brightest light I have ever seen in my life. It was whiteish yellow, and I do believe it was on my way to the gate of Heaven to meet our creator. I never did see anyone I know that has passed over, though I did think about how I was about to meet them. I did not see God, I do not think I got that far before my life was miraculously saved, but I did hear Him. I heard a voice tell me "It is not time yet."  
  NDE due to drowning.   

        5024.    Isaiah J NDE     3/26/2022.      NDE 9368.             this energy began to take form.  I believe this was my guardian angel. We did not exchange words, but I knew so much information instantly.  My guardian angel wanted me to return back to my body. I remember that I did not want to return.   
  NDE due to car accident.   

    5023.    Valentina D NDE     3/24/2022.      NDE 9367.        From Italy. Original in Italian, translated to English by Allison.    I turn suddenly and I am inside a tunnel... I am happy because those two little urchins recalled me to this earth, to play my role of mother, to continue my role as wife, daughter, sister, nurse.  The view, the perceptions are felt like they were all united with the atmosphere.  You know everything, you know it because you are absolutely conscious of everything.  You are expansive, you are the universe, you are infinity.  No pain, only love and infinite joy.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest during cardiac procedure.   

    5022.    Kevin L NDE     3/20/2022.      NDE 9362.       Exceptional Experience, from Canada.     I was transported to the event horizon or beyond of a black hole. Could I do this if I was alive? The answer I believe is 'No'. The power of a black hole is needed for a soul to travel from one universe to another. I feel no sense of danger and I also realize that I have no sense of distance or movement, but now I do notice that I am falling toward this fissure. Before I can react, I am engulfed by this light. The light absolutely engulfs me and all I can see is brilliant white light. Even months later, I have trouble finding the proper words to describe this, It felt like this light had attached itself to my soul and it was also attached to all my emotions. Then it feels like all my emotions are being pulled like a stretching of a thick rubber band, except it feels like I have a million rubber bands that are stretched all at once and they are getting to the breaking point.  
  Exceptional NDE due to allergic reaction to wasp sting.  Among the most profound and thought provoking NDEs ever shared with NDERF.   

    5021.    ErinRae G NDE     3/20/2022.      NDE 9365.            After looking at all that was below me, I looked up because I saw thee brightest light I have ever seen but it didn't hurt to look at it. I saw what looked like clouds swirling around the light, almost like I was about to move towards the light, I felt something carrying me and I tried to look behind me, and as I did, a huge white (maybe an angel?) wing lifted in front of the light  
  NDE at age 4 due to drowning.   

          5020.    Sharlene S NDE     3/19/2022.      NDE 9361.            But what was over everything, and what I can't stop thinking about, is the light. It is the most beautiful light I have ever seen--white and golden at the same time, clear and iridescent--like looking through a dragonfly's wing. Pure and holy and perfect. The light was alive and it was love and it was loving. And I wanted to dwell in it forever. And the light is called Glory. It is Heavenly Father. He is the Father of Glory.  
  NDE due to Covid.   

    5019.    Michael Mc Probable NDE     3/14/2022.      Probable NDE 9358.            The colors were spectacular and very, very vivid. Then I noticed flowers on the ground in front of us and also trees on distant mountains. The trees were all perfect shapes, like beautiful, green redwoods. The tip of each of the trees looked like they had diamonds on them. When the light beams hit those tree tips, it burst into hundreds of tiny light beams. It was unbelievable how light and colorful everything was. Then I noticed a valley below us, between our mountain and the mountain in the distance. The fog was still there, but I could see a city just below the fog. Many of the rooftops were round, ornate, and gold in color. My eyes kept getting drawn back to the original light source. That’s when Jesus said, 'It’s the glory of the Lord. 
  Probable NDE from ruptured appendicitis.   

    5018.    Robine C Probable NDE     3/9/2022.      Probable NDE 9357.       From France. Original partly in French and partly in English.     I feel light as a feather. I see the room where I am, but from the ceiling. This is where I feel an inner peace, a well being that is rather difficult to describe, there is a lot of love all around me, a very pleasant feeling. Then I feel like a presence with me, accompanying me on this journey. It is white and sweet. I feel like I’m walking on a cloud.  
  Probable NDE from a heart attack.   

    5017.    Jessica Kay NDE     2/28/2022.      NDE 9354.      Exceptional Experience.      I knew that every action may seem evil but it worked for the greater good. All was perfect in one way or the other. I asked about religion and the vastness of it all. The only answer I could recall afterwards was the word "dogma." This word stood for the concept that the truth was muddled by man's feelings. Although coming from our good intentions, it was inhibiting others from spiritually growing. 
  Remarkable NDE due to horse falling on her at age 5.   

    5016.    Barb M FDE       2/25/2022.      FDE 9353.       From Canada     At some point I started seeing a slide show wig my life. It was the strangest thing being in pain and struggling to breathe, then out of know where my life events were on the bathroom wall. A couple of pictures later the entire room lit up like a nighttime football game. The light was blinding, but the light was warm, inviting, peaceful. So very peaceful. It was like a big hug, a never ending beautiful hug.  
  Fear death experience from criminal attack by husband.   

      5015.    Monique R Possible NDE     2/20/2022.      Possible NDE;Drug Experience 9351.       From Canada     As they are panicking, I was saying, 'it’s ok!  I am alright.'  It’s like they couldn’t hear me so I yelled to them that I was ok.  While this was happening, I was ok?  I didn’t feel pain only peace.  I was trying to let them know how not to worry.  I didn’t see any light or travel through any tunnels but I did feel at peace although I should not have given my state.  
  Probable drug experience vs. Possible NDE at age 16.   

    5014.    Thomas U NDE     2/20/2022.      NDE 9350.            I didn’t feel any pain, and I was floating up then I looked down seeing my body. I look back up and it starts getting black around me closing in and I started to see a light which was warm to me. I was stopped. I felt a presence, and something told me. It didn’t sound like a man or women but something both. It said, it wasn’t my time, go back. I said, 'okay.'  
  NDE at age 4 due to falling off bicycle.   

    5013.    Sam K Probable NDE     2/20/2022.      Probable NDE 9347.            I was floating and bouncing on a harmonic circle of energy with the 12 beings of light on the perimeter. My being then became aware of a never ending vista with an endless horizon and light like the aurora borealis. An awareness of a world without end was evident. Upon this awareness came a more comforting message to my being that 'You are not alone in the universe. You will never be alone in the universe, because you are the universe' The favor of everlasting spirit was provided and the euphoria of spirit never left me.  
  Probable NDE due to cardiac arrest after heart operation.   

    5012.    David C NDE     2/19/2022.      NDE 9348.       From the United Kingdom     As I watch the three medics do their work this sense of detachment from linear time becomes stronger. I can see their world and know that I am in a different place where time as I knew it does not matter. I am aware that if I wanted to I could fast forward or rewind linear time, but I choose not to, I am engrossed with events around me. I can see everything at once as if I have fish eye lenses, 360 degree vision.  
  NDE due to apparent cardiac complication after surgery.   

    5011.    Laura B NDE     2/17/2022.      NDE 9346.            At first there was a great void.  Then I perceived a hazy light somewhere off in the distance.  I swam toward it.  Details began to emerge and I perceived a landscape that was sort of a combination of cave formations (stalagmites and stalactites) and someone's colon. A little further on these details became clearer and I found myself in a cenote, or underwater cave.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest with atypical content.   

    5010.    Ryan S SDE     2/17/2022.      SDE 9345.            Noel had this magnetic way with butterflies. They would follow her, land on her, and find her in unusual ways. People that knew nothing of our developing butterfly story would send her butterfly cards, jewelry, and more… the final miracle of Hannah's life was the timing of her departure. While I was typing, 'That's the one' to my friend, my wife said, 'She just took her last breath.'  
  Shared death experience at time of death of his daughter at age 18.   

    5009.    Anonymous NDE     2/13/2022.      NDE 16125.        Original in Chinese, translated to English by Jenny.    But after losing consciousness, I suddenly regained it. I saw my body was under the field in a vantage point at that time, about two meters away. It was like a soul out of the body, and I became relaxed and not struggled anymore. I heard peaceful music that sounded a bit similar to the ritual music of Western churches, and also like Chinese music as well, and then I saw my whole experience from childhood to adulthood through a third-person perspective; I saw my dead father, and some people I didn’t know.  
  NDE due to drowning.   

      5008.    Betty R NDE     2/11/2022.      NDE 9343.       Exceptional Experience.     I saw myself lying in the road and was curious and calm. I saw the horse make the additional 2 miles around the road back to the barn lot and another worker catch him; mind, this was miles from other houses. I saw my friend and employer look the horse over, look out over the fields for me, and get in the truck to head out on the road looking for me.  
  Exceptional NDE due to severe head and neck injury.  After NDE, remarkable recall of NDE in spite of substantial difficulty with memory of events after the NDE.  She is now a hospice nurse.   

      5007.    Ashley H NDE     2/11/2022.      NDE 9342.            I looked up to the sky and it was so warm so bright but there was no sun, just beautiful blue sky. I looked around me and was in a field of gold colored wheat and there were beautiful mountains. I turned my head to the right toward my front tire and there was a woman sitting next to me with a blue and white striped shirt, beautiful curly brown hair and my first thought was she looks like the 80s Era.  
  NDE due to car crash.   

    5006.    Dr. Cornelia T NDE     2/9/2022.      NDE 9336.            But what I can say is that it was the most eloquent discussion I ever had in my life. I disclosed my reasons why I didn't want to continue, and each time the escalator stopped and my arguments were carefully accepted and pondered and with much comprehension. Actually even more, I had the feeling that my opposite knew myself almost better than I did myself, and answered. As soon as I stopped talking I started again to move to the light. After a few 'stops' I heard very gently: “You are allowed to come”. And my discussion continued. The closer I came to the light the stronger was my wish to continue with this life on earth, and the clearer was my motivation.  
  NDE due to sepsis from complications prior to delivery.  Contributor is physician.   

    5005.    Kaitlin S Anesthesia     2/5/2022.      Anesthesia 9341.            She said to me, you can keep walking towards me. But if you do you’ll reach the point you can’t go back. You’ll reach the point of no return. And I said something like but it’s so cozy here. And she said yes. But your girls need you. You need to decide. And I remember it being a very hard decision, I wanted to stay in that place forever.  
  Anesthesia experience with no imminent life-threatening event.  Very NDE-like.   

    5004.    Daniel C NDE     2/5/2022.      NDE 9340.            I remember looking up and I saw a crescent-shaped line of huge trees that were about 200 yards away. The bark of the trees was white. The leaves were pink and there was gold lace coming out of the top of the trees hanging down with gold stars in the lace. I looked up at the sky and the sky was pink I wanted to see things that were familiar so I was looking for birds in the sky. There were no birds. I looked down at the Garden to see grass. Again trying to see things that were familiar. There was no grass but what I did see was The Gold Lace.  
  NDE due to cardiac arrest.   

    5003.    Harry T NDE     2/4/2022.      NDE 9339.        Exceptional Experience.    The bits of light closest to me were my parents, grand-parent, family who all passed before - and connected to them farther away were close friends, and connected to them were people who had influenced me and whom I had influenced (student, acquaintances,etc) - and the people whom they had interacted with, but unknown to me, but connected to me by my interaction with everyone I had known and met in my life and had gone on before.  All of those bits of life were relating how my life and actions had effected theirs.  
  NDE due to pulmonary embolus with remarkable life review and a message that may have saved his life.   

    5002.    Leslie G Probable NDE     1/29/2022.      Probable NDE 9338.            I found myself in a extremely dark, warm, peaceful place, for lack of a better word, I couldn’t see anything, but I wasn’t afraid. I felt a “presence” but I couldn’t see anything. I had no fear, although I was confused.  
  Probable NDE due to being hit by car at age 17.   

    5001.    Hugh P NDE     1/29/2022.      NDE 16124.       From Canada     My forced slow re-entry to this reality, came about by dots of energy rushing across my vision from left to right. The full four color spectrum of dotted energy were attempting to form into the structure we call physical. Dots were attempting to become trees, rocks, water and sky. Yet I continued resisting this world, willing myself to remain in the wonderful feeling of my heavenly home and as I did the physical world of multicolored dots would be replaced with darkness and I would return to the familiarity of ultimate Love.  
  NDE due to drowning while canoeing.   

      5000.    Ramona C NDE     1/29/2022.      NDE 9334.           I recall not being afraid and in a void (just clear open white space). I recall a life review but no judgement was attached to it just a play back.  I recall the presence of a guide but not really seeing that guide just communication with them telepathically. I floated for a while in this space, I am not sure for how long.  I recall an out of body experience; the medical team talking over my body and expressing concern that they did not know how much longer my other organs could hold out with the amount of medication I was getting and my heart's current function.  
  NDE due to coding several times around the time of surgery for coronary artery bypass grafts.   

    4999.    Mary AB Probable NDE     1/29/2022.      Probable NDE 9331.            I remember it clearly. I feel mine was different. I felt I was floating in a darkness. I wasn't scared. I had all these feelings like peace, that I was loved I was ok, I was safe. It was warm.  It was all our feelings.  
  Probable NDE due to suicide attempt with medication overdose. (Note:  This is a classic "void" experience that is not rare.)   

    4998.    Wen-Yu Lee     1/25/2022.      NDE 16123.       From China. Original in Chinese.  Translated to English by Jenny     Suddenly far ahead there was an opening in the sky.  Its multiple colors looked like it had a spill of the mixed colors oil paints in this grayish surrendering, however it felt vividly alive. Right after that there was a strong, forceful sucking sensation.  The colorful cave pulsated a powerful attraction. 
  NDE due to car accident.  [Note: Several readers have contacted me about the veracity of this experience.  Consider that this was published in an article that made it into a public forum, so must have been tacetly socially acceptable to their government. Was it altered, changed, or fictionalized?  I don't know. It would be similar to learning about an NDE published by the early Christians when the only people who could read and write were members of the clergy. I'm going to let readers decide for themselves on this one. Whatever individuals decide, it won't be used in stringent NDERF research. - Jody]   

      4997.    Krystal N Possible NDE     1/17/2022.      Possible NDE 9328.            I was approached by three blue beings. They were pure love and had no features or sexual identity. They were just this vivid blue human-like form. As they approached me, two of them stopped a few feet away as the other continued toward me. This being used no verbal words, nor a human language to communicate with me. It was more like frequency sounds and colors. This being came to my right side and put its hand on my shoulder. With its other arm, it motioned me to look around me. As I looked, I was told this is the place of the souls birth and departure. I watched as souls came and went in and out of these archways that spanned beyond my vision.
  Possible NDE during operation and probable hallucinatory experience in recovery room.   

    4996.    Stephanie L NDE     1/16/2022.      NDE 9327.            I woke up in white void. There was no ground or physical objects. I felt like I had been having philosophical conversations with an unseen man. He had a reassuring voice that made me feel no doubt or fear. It felt like I was there a very long time. I was interrupted by him and the only words I remember were him telling me “You need to wake up right now, it will be beautiful”  
  NDE due to unconsciousness at time of “Blowing fire with inhaled computer duster.”
