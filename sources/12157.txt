  		              		Experience Description   

    On February 13, 2018, I had surgery for a deviated septum and I was fully anesthetized. I can recall being wheeled into the operating room. It was more of a square room and I came in on one side. There was  a smaller door directly opposite of me. There were a bank of windows on my right, and just a wall on the left. I can recall seeing some floor-standing, large and metal operating lights that looked vintage. I was brought into the center of them. After a few minutes and some chatter from the three people in there with me, I don't remember anything else.
  
  When I opened my eyes in recovery there was a nurse attending to me and she introduce herself, saying, 'Hello.' I said, 'Hello' back. I then said, 'I have just been flying around the operating room, I'm a flyer. Are you a flyer too?' 

  I have had dreams all of my life that I am flying. The context of the dreams may vary but I fly or float and even sometimes bring people up in the air with me. 

  When I realized what I had said, I thought, 'Oh boy, she is going to think that I am crazy by saying that!' I closed my eyes to pretend that I was falling back asleep. At the moment I closed my eyes, the memory of what had happened in the operating room came to me.
  
  I was in the far left corner of the room, for I could see the operating room floor lights and the bank of windows. From what I recall,  my line of sight was angled up, for I could only see the upper half of the lights. I did not look straight across or down.  I do not remember seeing myself or the other people in the room. As my eyes panned across, I looked up at the ceiling and could see many small oblong shaped white lights and they were randomly racing very fast in all different directions and elevations along the ceiling.

   At that moment I began to feel myself rise upwards, very slowly. As I was getting closer to ceiling, the objects that I was seeing started to become less random and they slowed down. I continued to rise and almost reached the ceiling. When I looked across the room, I saw that the lights had organized and become like a swimming school of fish. They were waving back and fourth and doubling back on each other. They started in the far diagonal corner from me and I thought how incredibly beautiful it was. Then I saw that they were getting closer to me. Then, I was enveloped in the school of lights and became part of the wave. It felt so great and unbelievable to be racing through the air but then as the wave doubled back on itself it slowed down.  I came close to the other side and as it passed, I could see that we all had faces. I thought that these were all people just like me. Then,  I realized that I must look just like them. I was'nt alarmed by that realization either. I  thought, 'Oh yeah, why would I look any different?'

  I don't recall anything after that. The overall feeling that has stuck with me, and I almost wanted to tell my physician, was that 'We are not alone in there.' I choose never to tell him that.
