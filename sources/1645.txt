 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  The Harbinger of Light</I>      

    Summary:  From Pat Deveney's journal database:
 Harbinger of Light, The.
 A Monthly Journal Devoted to Zoistic Science, Free Thought, Spiritualism and the Harmonial Philosophy / A Monthly Journal Devoted to Psychology, Occultism, and Spiritual Philosophy / Devoted to Occultism and Spiritual Philosophy.
 1870—1954  Monthly
 Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.  Publisher: W.H. Terry; Charles H. Bamford.  Editor: William Henry Terry; Mrs. Charles [Annie] Bright.
 1/1, September 1870-1954.
  Six shillings a year. 
 Terry (1836-1913) was free-thinking Unitarian who took up spiritualism in the 1850s.  He began working as a medium in 1869 and began this journal (under “direct spiritual injunction”) the next  year, editing it until he resigned in 1905, though he transferred his interest in the journal to his nephew Charles H. Bamford in 1887.  He was a participant from a distance in most of the controversies within spiritualism and Theosophy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.   Annie Bright (1840-1913) was editor from 1905-1913 and wrote much of the journal herself under the guidance of her spiritual helpers.  After the death of W.T. Stead on the Titanic in 1912 (see the note under Borderland) she wrote a volume on the spiritual world under his inspiration.  See the note under Cosmos.  In the 1920s, W. Britton Harvey edited and published the journal.  Stanford University; LOC; University of Texas, Austin; University of Waterloo (Ontario); National Library of Australia, microfilm.
