I do remember seeing what seemed to be angels of some sort or clerics in white robes leaning over me where I lay. I saw what looked like a field and a piece of the track I was lying on in the physical realm. I do believe that what they gave me was a book and on the cover of this book it said 'Book of Prophecies' and ever since that day I have been more aware of things changing that should not have changed or have the need to change. My experience was nothing like what others have seen or heard of. I had more NDEs after that first. There was one where I saw a lake of lava in a cave like place. I believe that was hell. The second one after that I saw dragons of all kinds flying over a field of sorts. The last one I had showed me a burning city on earth. And I will tell you I don't believe I have ever seen a 'Jesus' in any of them.
