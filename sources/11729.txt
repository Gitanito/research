  		              		Experience Description   

  I was drinking a lot of vodka with some friends, about half a fifth of vodka by myself. I walked outside and collapsed on the front porch. The next thing I remember was waking up in darkness due to the EMT trying to intubate me. I was still connected to my body. I remember resisting them as they did this. It was extremely painful.

   Then I don't remember anything until I floated out of my body at the hospital. As I floated out of my body, I was at the ceiling looking down on it. I vaguely remember going through some sort of round tunnel with lights flashing on the right. Then I was in an arched tunnel. This tunnel was different than the one I went through to get there. It was shaped like an  igloo except it wasn't made of snow. The entrance to the igloo was a really long, dark tunnel. I remember looking to my right.  The walls of the tunnel seemed wet and made of rough-cut stone or clay. At the end of the tunnel was an extremely bright light. The tunnel felt murky. Aside from the light emanating from the end of the tunnel, it was dark. I was probably 20 feet away from the end of the tunnel where the light was. 

  I was drawn to the light, although  I wasn't sure what it was. I distinctly remember walking toward the light of my own volition. I took my time to take it all in. I seemed to have feet, though I never thought to looked down at myself to verify that I had feet.  It all felt peaceful and natural. The closer I got to the light, the more I understood what was going on. I knew that I had left my physical body and was passing on. I also knew I had been here before and that I was 'home'.  

  As I exited the tunnel into a dome area of the  igloo-shaped structure, the light became more of an entity sitting on a  a chair that looked like a throne. In reality the throne  was  a stone chair with a body of light sitting in it. The Being seemed to be amused at my arrival. I couldn't see a smile but I seemed to be able to feel it. The light did not have a form. It was just a bright light that was brighter than the sun. If I was using human eyes, I probably would not have been able to look at it. The hrone was situated at the back of the igloo, in what  I'd call a throne room. It was distinctly different than the tunnel I was in. The walls were almost a pearly-white, bluish color. The body of light kept the area well-lit. 

  I definitely felt like I knew the 'light' on a personal level. The light seemed to manifest an arm and gestured for me to look at the floor to the light's left which was my right. The floor  was the same color as the walls but turned into a type of viewing area, or looking glass when the light gestured to it with its hand. I walked up to the light and faced right. The light was within inches of me.  I looked at the floor and I could see my body lying in the hospital bed. The light rested it's left hand on my left shoulder and telepathically asked me if I wanted to 'go back'. The instant I thought 'yes,' I was back in my body and being slapped by my mother as she was trying to waken me. She says that it was the doctor that was slapping me,  but I'm pretty positive it was her.

     Beyond that, not much else happened. I wasn't given any kind of tour. I imagine if I was, I would have decided to stay. At the time I didn't have any 'dead' relatives so there wasn't anyone to visit with. I did, however, lose a dog. But he was not present in the experience. I imagine seeing him also would have made me stay.

    NDE Elements:         

    At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Drug or medication overdose.       Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)     Shallow and spontaneous respiration.    

    How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant    

    Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I saw my body from another location.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it    

    How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I kind of just knew things that weren't shown to me.    

    At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I was at a much higher level of consciousness, but I don't believe I was at my highest level.    

    Were your thoughts speeded up?         No    

    Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Time seemed to go faster or slower than usual.    If I was to repeat the event in earth time, it would have lasted at least a minute and up to three minutes. As I looked at my heart monitor, it doesn't appear that I was gone more than a few seconds, if that.    

    Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid    

    Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Vision seemed the same.    

    Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I didn't really hear anything. The light communicated telepathically and through gestures.    

    Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No    

    Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     There were two tunnels. The first tunnel was more like a wormhole, the second was the arched tunnel before the light.    

    Did you see any beings in your experience?         No    

    Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin    

    Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   I saw light the size of a human but it was formless.    

    Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I definitely felt like I was 'above'. I could have been anywhere honestly. I could have been in this universe or a completely different dimension.    

    What emotions did you feel during the experience?         I felt peace, calm, comfort, serenity,and  a feeling of being home. It all felt natural.    

    Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Relief or calmness    

    Did you have a feeling of joy?         No    

    Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt no longer in conflict with nature    

    Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others     I understood everything about the situation. I have no idea why I chose to come back though.    

    Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No         

    Did scenes from the future come to you?         No         

    Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   I was asked if I wanted to come back. As soon as I thought 'yes' I was back in my body.    

    God, Spiritual and Religion:         

    What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Protestant       

    Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I hate going to church. It seems very inauthentic.    

    What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   I believe in God    

    Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I didn't feel any judgement. I didn't feel like anything I did here mattered at all.    

    Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     I no longer identify as a 'Christian'. I still love Jesus and consider myself a Follower of Jesus.    

    Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I encountered what I believe to be God.    

    Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No    

    Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Uncertain   I assumed the light was Jesus for a long time. The light never identified itself as Jesus. I wasn't given the impression that the light was Jesus while I was having the experience.    

    During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Uncertain     I assume that the light was God, however the light didn't say it was god and I did not specifically get that impression.    

    Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:         

    During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No       

    During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I kind of just knew at a certain point.    

    Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No         

    During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No         

    What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I've grown more empathetic to homelessness, poverty, and violence. I despise war. Whereas, before the NDE, I idolized it. I find myself doing my own life reviews constantly thinking about where I could have done something different.    

    Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No     

    After the NDE:         

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No       

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember from the arched tunnel to coming back like it happened yesterday. The wormhole memory is vague but I still remember it.    

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I have insanely, vivid dreams and visions of things that will happen. The day before 9/11, I saw a vision of a passenger plane in the sky while I was on the beach. A lot of personal dreams I've had have come to fruition. I get a lot of synchronicity and confirmations.    

    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          When the light rested its hand on my shoulder, I knew no matter what happened here everything was going to be ok.    

    Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I shared this with my mom immediately after I came to. Unfortunately, she just laughed it off. I've shared it with a handful of others, but most people just blow it off.    

    Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No       

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I knew it was real. It is/was as real or more real than our experience in our bodies.    

    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I have not changed in how I feel about it.    

    At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No       

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I have the medical records and would like them to be posted with my story. I have the ECG printout but I have no idea how to read it.    

    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Details about the tunnel, the location of the light, the wormhole etc. I believe that if these questions are asked of everyone, we will get a much clearer picture of the afterlife. There are other NDErs who describe the arched tunnel differently than me but it is still agreeable with my experience.
