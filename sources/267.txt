Of the twelve figns of the Zodiac, thefeven planets
and their ftveral influences over the future
Events of a perfons life, and manners*
IT is not our defign to give here a general fyfiem
of Aftrology, our only purpofe being to point
out the nature and effeft which the courfe of each
planet in its paflage through the twelve figns of the
Zodiac has upon the temper of each perfon, and
to prove, that from a judicious obfervation of the
fituation ef each planet at the hour of birth, you
may eafily forefee what kind of life that child will
lead, ana what the bent of his inclinations will b e;
and from this foreknowledge, you will eafily
comprehend the kind of education you are to give
him.
. The revolutions of the fun, /being the bell
known, and his power being greateft over the fe-
veral parts of this fublunary creation* .we {hall be
moil particular in our obfervations upon him, and
tell the refult of our .many experiments upon him.
About the twentieth of March, which ancients
confidered as the beginning of the year, the fun en­
ters the firft of the twelve figns, whofe name is
Aries, or the Ram ;—a man born at or little after
this period, will be of a meek difpofition, mode­
rately amorous, rather baihful, a little inclined to
wavering in his refolutions, unwilling to quarrel,
but if compelled to it will conduft himfelf with
propriety, not over fanguine in his purfuits, and
on the whole., will be tolerably happy in life. In

fefs thofe qualities in a higher degree.
A woman bom at the lame period, will be fwect
tempered, model!, chalte, and decently fond of
tholes fhe is bound to love; ihe will not be over
anxious about the affairs of this world, but will en­
deavour, without afliduity, to gain an honeft live­
lihood, and will be ready to relieve the diftrefles
of a fellow creature.

intimidated; ihe will enjoy a good deal of fatis-
feftion.
About thè twentieth of May, the fun enters the
fliird figri, called Gemini^ or the Twins;—aman
born at this time, will ulUce his chief happinefs in
the arms of the fair lex ; he will be nice in his
opinion of the beauty of women, inclined to ram­
bling into foreign countries, ambitious of ihining
ih feme excellent qualities, fitch as learning, me­
chanics, &c.—his underftanding will be folid, his
imagination lively,, his memory uncertain, his

o f a fober fedate difpofition of mind, not eafily
excited to mirth, fenous and perfevering in his
xefolves, rather diffident of his own talents, and de*.
pend too much upon the opinion of other«; he

ments, and not inclined to infidelity in love; he
will be induftrious and provident.

mirth and good cheer, of a temper rather captious,

yet will not maintain it with provoking obftinacy;
upon the whole Ihe will enjoy a reafonable {hare
of quiet. ' \

fifth fign, called Leo, or the Lion;—a man ufh-
ered into the world at this feafon, will be of a tur­
bulent and rapacious .difpofition; he will delight
in law-fuits, quarrels and broils, and although he

qualify, tliat is to fay, increafe or leifen thefe in­
fluences ; one ot the moll eifential of which, is an
early attention to the education of the child, with
proper pains to correft by prudent leifons of mora­
lity and religion, the difpofitions here foretold;
befides wlrich, there are the feveraf effefts, which
the five other Planets have upon the minds, and
bodies of all creatures upon this earth ; of thefe
influences or effefls, we. will now endeavour to
give the cleared and bed explanation ; that the
inequality of their movements will adinit of, but
mult leave a good deal to your own judgment and
induftry,.. • ••. ,
The firft and moft malignant of thofe is Saturn,
who employs thirty years, in performing his revo­
lution through the twelve figns ; fortunate difpc-
iitjon of Providence, for were he to return oftener,
the perfons bcwjn under his influence; would prove
four, morofe, tyrannical and bloody ;. in fliort, they
would he worle than the moft barbarous favagcs;
but as liis entrance into ifie fign, along with the
fun is neceifary to give him,a predominance over
that genial planet, there are but tew :that arciub-
jec^ed to him.:—Thus it is, that though fometimes
blood is wantonly filed, it, feldom happens that
th6.¿rime is attended tfiofe circumftances of
barbarity,, that ,fprm t|he character of this planet;
the*fame may be laid of other fiiocking inftances
of .cruelty, but 'where fuch things oorne to pafs,
you may be well affined that Saturn, prefided at
the biith of the perfems chiefly, concerned-in them ;
for doo frequently peiioi>s are made inftruments
in thofe unuatpral ;iayrifiGes,! wihp abhor the very
thoughts .of them. ; .

twelve figns, by which his conjunfHon with the
fun happens but feldom ; hence we have fo few
inftances of that ungovernable ambition, which
would climb over the lives and fortunes of the
deareft ties which nature and fociety have given
to man, to attain to fupreme power and uncon*
troulable dominion. «
The third planet is Mars, who takes the fame
time as Jupiter, in his journey through -the twelve
figns.—W e mult not attribute to his empire the
feveral wars that have occalionally happened, nor
the difpofitions which lead many to embrace a
military life; they more frequently arife. from
other concurrent and fecondary occafions, which
it would be impoffible feverally tp enumerate; for
certain it is, that many thoufands of thofe who
fight-the battles of others, are not impelled to it by
that defire of glory, which is the neceffary confe-
qiience of the fuperiority of this planet; as very
few are actuated by that principle, and feek for
any other advantage than idleness, plunder, or an?
exemption from fome lefs agreeable occupation.
Venus is the fourth Planet, the molt benignant
of the whole number; fhe prefides over, and natu­
rally infpires all creatures with that fecret defire, that
natural impulfe to the propagation of the fpecies,
than which nothing can give fopure, fo lafling and
fo frequent a delight to the thinking foul; on her
conftant attendance on the fun, depends entirely
that infpiration to love which is found in the fexe»
to each other.—Without her, a tirefome infuffera-
ble apathy, would pervade the whole creation; her
benign and maternal influence keeps alive in the
breaft that vivifying fpark, that urges us constantly
to feek in each other, thofe comforts which no in­
dividual can poffibly find within himfelf; fhe checks*

-reftrains, and qualifies the fuggeflions of the othfr
planers, and hence we frequently find the ambitious
man, forgetful of his aims, retire to enjoy the ex-
quifite bhfs which a judicioufly felefted perfon of
the oppofite lex can alone bellow ; hence we fee
the foldier, after the fatigues of battles, marches,
and dangers, folace himfelf with a chofen compa­
nion oi the other fex ; hence we perceive the
mifer, wbofe foul is abforbed by his treafures,
who deprives himfelf of the very neceflaries o£
life, at the miraculous infpiration of this charming
planet, open his iron chefts, and unfeeling; bofom,
to laviih on a beloved object thofe fums which
no otlier inducement whatfoevef could extort from
him, in fhort, to this planet we owe the principal
jjlifs we are capable of partaking of in this world;
happy that its prefence is fo conftant, and its in­
fluence fo unlverfal.
Mercury, equally benignant with Venus, is
the fifth Planet, but his influence is .of a different
nature : he performs hisjourney with the fun, and
never feparates himfelf from him ;—from him we
receive wit, underHanding, memory, vivacity,
'and wealth, for he prefides over all thofe. W ere
it not for the predominance of fome other planet
at the time, all thofe who are born under this be­
neficent ftar, would enjoy equal privileges, and
uninterrupted happinefs would be the lot of the
major part of mankind.
The Moon, is the fixth and laft of thofe Planets*
and goes through the twelve figns in about twen­
ty-eight davs; when fhe has the fuperiority at
the birth of a child, fhe makes him aull, heavy,
ina&ive, and infenfible to all that happens about

of a fincere attachment, and may be coniidered as a.

Thus have we conditfted our readers through
this knotty part of our taik, and ihall conclude it
by a neceilary observation. It is evident that the
generality of mankind do .not pay fufficient at­
tention to the fituations of the planets, and hence
thoufands would be incapable of drawing advan­
tage from our labours, did we not give them the
following dire&ions.— -To know what planet
was moftly in conjun&ion with the fun, you muft
be particularly well informed of the month in which
Îou were bom ; if the time of the month, it will
e flill better ; then examine your own difpofition?
but with impartiality, and be careful net to attribute
to yourfelf virtues, which you do not poffefs ; nor
fuppofe yourfelf addi&ed to vices, which you oc-
cafionally give into ; feparate all your qualities in
your mind, and try which of them is ftrongeft, and
carries you away with the moft force; by this
means you will eafily difcover what planet was pre­
dominant at the time you came into the world..

A woman-of the fame' kind of hair, will be

will be of a good conftitiutian, have many children,
be much reipetted, enjoy good health, and a rea-

If the hair is ihort and buihy, it will make very #

will be more forward to ftrike when angered, and
the woman more of afcold. 1
A man:with light brown long fmqoth hair, is of

A man with, fair hair will be of a weak confti-
tution, his mind much given to xefle&ion, efpeci-
ally on religious matters; he will be affiduous in
his occupation but not given to rambling; very
moderate in his amorous wiffies, and mull take
great pains to live to a middling age.
A woman of this coloured hair is, on the con­
trary, of a good conilitution, never to be diverted
from her purpofes, very paffionate in love affairs,;
never eafy unlefs when m company, apd delights
in hearing herfelf praifed, efpecially for beauty;
delights in dancing, romping, and violent exercifes,
"and commonly lives to a great age. .
A man with long red hair, is coining, artful;
and deceitful; he is very much additted to traffic
of fome kind, reftlefs in his difpofition, conftantly
roving, if he pofljbly can indulge himfelf in the de­
fire ; oftener defirous oi the pleafures of love, than
capable of indulging himfelf in them; he is greedy
of getting money, though he will ofte*r fpend it
fooiilhly ; in every thing he undertakes he is inde­
fatigable, and no obfiacle will induce him to for*
lake his ejtterprize until he has feenthe iffue of .it;
hje is by nature rather inclined to timidity, and
dread of pain, but by refte&ion may correfl it, and
pais for a man of courage.
A woman of the fame kind o f hair,, js glib o f

cpniUfcuhon is generally vigorous, but ihe feldom
lives to fee old age for a very obvious reafon, her
promife is feldom to be depended upon, becaufe*

her forgetful of every thing that preceded it ; (h«
will give nothing without a valuable con liberation,
and will laftingly relent any difappointment ihe
may meet with.
W e will now proceed to give fome few inftruc-
■tions concerning the hair in other particulars; and
firft, with refpeft to haldnefs.
lith e hair falls off at the fore part of the head,
-the perfonwill beeafily led, though otherwife rati­
onal, and will often find himfelf duped when he
thinks he is afting right; he will likewife very
frequently meet with disappointments in money
matters, which will either hurt .life credit, or force
■him to -Jhorten his cvpeiVe.
* If the hair trills, off' behind, he will he obftinatc,
’peeviih, paihonate, and fond of commanding others,
.though he has no right, and will grow angry if
his advice is nor followed, however prepollerous ;
he will he ioml of hearing and telling old ftories,
and tales of ghohs, gold ins, fairies, andotherincre-
,dibl6 -matters; but will be a good domeftic man,
and provide for his family to the uemoft of his
power.
If-the hair forms an arch round the forehead,
f^rithout being much-indented at. the temples, both
- jian and woman will be innocent, credulous,
peaceable, fond of good eating but without excefs;
\ moderate in all their defires,:and though not ardent
•in tlieir pufiuits, will ftill be perfevering, they will
be mild, modcit, and good-natured, moderately
profperottSj biit not very long lived.
- If the hair is much indented at the temples, the
.perfonwill be affable, fteady, good-natured, a great
.breeder, -prudent^ and attentive to bufinefs, of ar
folid conftitution and likely to live long.

If the hair defeends low upon the forehead, the
pcrfonwill he felfifh and designing, of a furly dif-
pofition, unfociable, and given to drinking ; he
will be addifted to avarice, and will not fpend un-
lefs he expcâs to gain by it ; his mind will be al-
ways intent upon the ^means of carrying on his
ichemes, and he will not live to be of a great
agc*
Thus far we have given the fruits at our expe­
rience concerning the hair ; we will now proceed
to the forehead, from which, as from an index, may
be collefted the innermoft movements of the foul ;
and here, a judicious eye will readily gather the
opinion that is to be formed of thofe we converfe
with, and the dangerous members of fociety ex­
cluded, avoided or guarded againil ; whereas by
want of a competent knowledge of this index,
many unwary perfons are drawn into evil compa­
ny, fufpicion, imprifonment, and frequently
death.
The forehead that is large, round, and fmooth,
announces the man or woman, frank, open, gene­
rous, and free, good-humoured, good-natured, and
a fafe companion ; into his bofom you may.pour
your fecrets without diftruft ; he poffeffes a clear
understanding, and fcorns to be guilty o f any meut
attion; he will be faithful to his promifes, juft in
his dealings, ftedfaft to his engagements, and fin->
cere in his affections ; his love for the fair one
whom he felefts, will be tender, manly, and
inviolable, provided her own mifeonduft does not i
in Ipite o f his inclination, baniih the mild influ­
ence from his breaft ; be will feek wealth, but hjs. I
purpofe in the. purfùit of it, will be to divide a rea,
fonable {hare of it among fuch of his friends, or
çther worthy perfons, as may be found to deferve

it; his converfation will be lively, fnodeft, and
pleafmg, he will be refpe&cd by moll people who
know him ; but his candour and integrity will pro­
cure him many enemies, among thofe, who can- _
not bear to lee, any perfon pollened of better qua­
lities than they themfelves will cultivate; hence
he mull expeil perfecution, lawfuits, and llander ;
malicious people will endeavour to excite his wife
to jealoufy,' his children to rebellion, his family to
reproach, and his neighbours to difiruft ; but his
noble nature, his upright conduft, arid irreproach­
able life, will*, in the end, get the better of thofe ef­
forts* and he will fhine out in all the brilliancy of
a fair and hoheft chara&er; he will enjoy mode­
rate health, and will feldom die before he attains
the age of iixty, or upwards.
If the forehead is flat in the middle, the man or
woman will be found to be vain glorious, proud,
and .little difpofed to generofity ; very tenacious
of his honour, but brave, and will lometrmes give
money away, more out of oifentation than anv good
principle; he will be fond of pfying into the fe-
crets of others, though not with an intention ’of
betraying them ; he w ilf endeavour to fupprefs
quarrels, aud reconcile rancour, for the fake of
being couriered as a peace-maker, not from any
regard tp the pgurties; he will be a great reader,
especially of newdpapets* and hiftory, and will
make very judicious remarks on them, (novels and
plays.for the woman;) in love affairs, he-will be

anient, and very cautious of his own reputation, as
well as of that of his miiirefs ; lie will be zealous
for the welfare of his family, and get many chil­
dren, whom he will not luffer to degrade them-
felves ; but if they ihould, he will beat them with
the utmoif feveritv, and will notbeeafily prevailed
on to forgive them.
If there is a hollow acrofs the forehead in the
middle, with a ridge, as of flefh, above, and another
below, the man will be a good fcholar, the wo­
man a great, manufablurer, or attentive to what
eyer occupation (he may be engaged in ; they will
be warm in argument of debate, but will never de-
feend to fcurrility, they; will not be liberal in be­
llowing, but if they can be of feiVice without hurt­
ing thcmfelves, they will do it cheerfully ; love
will not be their predominant pallion, nor indeed,
do they feem to have any fo flrong as to be looked
upon as charaHeriflical ; they will have but tew
children, and thofc at- very dillant periods, per­
haps three, four, iometimes feven years between
every two; they will be firm and fteady in any
point they fix their minds upon, and by their per­
severance will fcar.eelv ever fail of: carrying their
objefl; yet they will meet with many crofles, but*
will bear them with a tolerable ihare of patience..
If the forehead juts out immediately, at and
over the eyebrows, running flat up to the hair, the
man or woman will be fulky* croud, infolcnt,
imperious, and treacherous; he will be impatient
of contradiftion, apt to give great abufe, and to
ilrike if he thinks he can do it with advantage;
in his dealings he will over-reach if he poifiblv can,
and will never forgive an injury, but will take
every opportunity to prejudice the perfon whom
he confidcrs as his enemy by word or deed; he
' ; will

will always endeavour to unite intereft with love,
and will not fuffer himfelf to be openly governed
by his wife; but he will be fubjeft to be deceived
by artful perfons of either fex, who will flatter
his paflions, and thus gain their own ends to his
detriment; he will experience many changes of for­
tune, but will never be reduced to abfolute poverty;
he will be fertile in refources, and very fubtle in
argument; he will have few children, but in quick
fucceilion, and will make himfelf many enemies.
If the temples are hollow, with the bones ad­
vancing towards the forehead on either fide, fo
that the fpace between muff be neceffarily flat*
with a fmall channel or indenture riling from the
upward part of the nofe to the hair, the man or
woman will be of a daring and intrepid temper,
intruding into matters in which they are totally
unconcerned, defi'rous of palling for wits, and of
a fubtle and enterprizing nature, greedy of praife,
quick in quarrel, and of a reiflefs and wandering
difpofition; extremely ewd, and never ferioufly
attached to one object; credulous for a moment,
hut eafily undeceived, and full of refentment as
they feel their pride hurt.— In them the under-
ftanding will be rather weak, and they will trou­
ble themfelves but little ..about the confequences
that may refult from their proceedings, provided
they gratify the caprice of the moment; they will
delight in hearing of battles, riots, and difturb-
ances, and will foment and contribute towards them
to the utmoif of their‘power, but ftrive always to
keep themfelves out of harm ; they will feldom be
out of fome fcrape, will always have fecret, as well
as open enemies, and can expeft but little profpe-
rity ; they will feldom have above one or two;
children, and will not live to ah advanced age»

W e have now given ail that can he faid of the
forehead, as far as we could poffibly recollect,
the differences that may occur in that fmall part
of the countenance ; and fhall now proceed to the
eyebrows, on which a great deal depends in the
fcience of prognoilication.
If the eyebrow is very hairy, and that hair long
and curlecl with feveral of the hairs ftarting out, the .
manor woman is of a,gloomy difpofition, litigious,
and quarrelfome, but rather cowardly, greedy
after the affairs of this world, perpetually brootl­
ing over fome melancholy iubjeil, and not an
agreeable companion ; he will be diffident penuri­
ous, and weak in his underitanding ; never addicted
to any kind of learning, and eafy of belief in any
thing that tends to the gratification of his favourite
wifh, to attain which, he jvill give up his fyftem of
ceconomy, and freely beftow in hopes of gaining
his point, he will pretend to love where he feels
none, and makes his affefted paffion fubfervient
to his pecuniary defigns, he will have many chil­
dren, but will if polhble defer fettling tnem in
the world, left the neceffary portions ihould inter*
fere with his other fchemes, and will never enjoy
any reafonable (hare of mental fatisfa£ion ; he will
be very fond of d rinking, but will fupprefs his de­
fire left he ihould be betrayed into a difeovery of
his fecrets, and will enjoy a long and turbulent
life.
Ifi a man or woman has thin eyebrows, but
with fome long hairs, he will be of a fickle difpo-
fition, weak-minded, credulous, and vain; al­
ways hunting after novelties, and negleftful of
his more ferious bufinefs, he will be talkative,
pert, and rather difagreeable in company; very
fond of contradiction, and frequently bring him-
Digitized by Google
fclf into fcrapes by his ìnconfiderete expre{fioris';
lie will be fulpicious where he ihould be candid,
and confident, where he ihould fear defign ;
though anxious to preferve hisfccrets, he will be ca-
fily induced to difeover them, his enmities will be
violent, but not lalling; he will not be eaiily led
into lawfuits, and quarrels ; but if forced to engage
in them, he will profecute them with violence ;
he will not bear difappointments eafily, and will
be particularly unhappy if he is croifed in love,
which will be his favourite paflion; he will bead,
dialed to drinking, rather for the fake of company,
than fromanv attachment to liquor; and will not
behave himielf properly when overcome by dt*
but will dilturb thè tranquility of others, and get
himfelf into difagreeable fituations ; he will have
many children, and live to a good old age.
If the eyebrow is thick and even, that is, with­
out any, or few darting hairs, the man or woman
will be of an agreeable temper, found underiland-
ing, and tolerable wit ; moderately addifted to plea-
fure, fearful of giving offence, but intrepid and
perfevering in fupport of right ; he will be chaf
ritable, tender-heated, and generous, but never
' io far as to exceed the bounds of reafon, or his in­
come ; he will be fincere in his profeflions of love or
friendlhip, but cautious that the perfon be worthy of
his efteem ; he will not eafily fuffer himfelf to be ¡m-
pofed upon, but will prudently weigh every tranf-
aftion before he engages in it ; if he is deceived
he" will bear it with fortitude, but will aft with
more circumfpeftion afterwards, and will rather
forbear entering into a connection, than expofe
himfelf to be cheated a fecond time ; he will bo
an excellent family man, tender, and affeftionate
to his wife, attentive to his children, faithful to
C 2 „ hi*

Ms friends, obliging to his neighbours, and affa­
ble, and courteous to all men ; he will enjoy a
good conilitution, and is likely to live long.
If the eyebrow is fmall, thin of hair, and even,
the man or woman is weak minded, timorous,
fuperficial, and not to be depended on ; he will
be deiirous oF knowledge, but will not have pa­
tience and affiduity enough to give it the nccef-
fary attention ; he will be de[irons of praife for
worthy actions, but will not have fpirit and per-
feverance enough to perform them in that degree
of excellence, that is requiiite to attraft the notice
of men of judgment and difeernment; he will
not be of an over amorous conilitution, though
far from being an enemy to love; he will be ra­
ther fond of money, but not to any degree bor­
dering on penurioufnefs; but when an occafion
offers that he thinks good, though he will be often
miliaken, will give it liberally ; he will be kind to
his family, fo long as he thinks they a6l with pro-
iriety ; but on a flight appearance of mifconaufl,
e-will fly off, and will feem inexorable for awhile,
will be eafily led back, and made fenfible of
his error ; he will be petulant in difeourfe, and
apt to provoke by his language, but will 'readily
apologize for any impertinence he may be guilty
o f ; he will be ready to promife every thing that
is afked of him, an,d more than he can poilibly
perform, and will attribute his failure to other
caufes than that which really occafioned it ; he
will be of a delicate conilitution, and fubjeftto
frequent fits of ficknefs, but will have many chil­
dren, and by temperance and a proper regimen,
may live long.'
If the eyebrow is thick of hair towards the
aofe, and goes off fuddenly, very thin, ending in a
point
[ 28 ]

'point, the man or woman will be furly, capti­
ous, jealous, fretful, and eaiily provoked to rage ;
whatever he undertakes he will purfue it with vio-
lence, until he meets with fome great obftacle,
and then he will abandon it entirely, and will not
be prevailed upon to begin it again ; in his love
affairs, he will be intemperate, but a fmall mark of
unkindnefs will break his chain, and it will be im-
poflible to rivet it again; he will* be of a daring
and intrepid difpofition at times, and at others he.
will be as pufillanimous arid daftardly; in his con­
ven tion , he will be uneven, and ftart fuddenly
frdm one fubjeft to another ; he will be rather in­
clined to penury, and will provide well for hia
family, which will be numerous.
W e thought it neceffary to enlarge on thefe
fubje&s, as To much can be gathered from them
concerning the tempers and difpolitions of our
fpecies ; and we flatter ourfelves, that “our readers
will not take it amifs, that we here make a re­
mark, from which mull accrue to them the moil
folid benefits ; it is, that as men and women are by
nature intended and adapted for the fweets of fo-
ciety, fo it is effentially neceffary, in order to at­
tain thofe fweets, and to avoia the acrimonies
and difpleafures, that mull unavoidably accrue
from a wrong choice in our companions, that we
be enabled to form a previous judgment of the
charafters of thofe with whom we defire to affo-
ciate; that thus we may be enabled to affimilate
our partnerihips in every department, and this
fcience, fo important to our temporal happinefs,
can be procured only' by a thorough knowledge
of thefecret fprings that urge them toaftion ; and
which, in fpite of their utmofl addrefs and endea­
vours, will appear either in the natural aflbmblage

6l their features, or in the adventitious move­
ments, which the workings of the foul will pro­
duce in them ; but as the eye holds a diitinguimed
place in the fcience of Phyfiognomy, we illall now
proceed to give the obfervations which we have
been able to make on that organ.
And firft, the eye that is large, full, prominent,
and clear, denotes a man or woman to be of an
ingenuous and candid difpofition, void of deceit,
and of an even, agreeable, and affable difpofition ;
feldom yielding to any thing in excefs, modeft,
and fcamful in the affairs ot love though by no
means an enemy to its gratification; firm, though
itot obftinate; in his refolves of a good and foiid
underftanding; of an agreeable, but not brilliant
wit,' and clear and juft- in argument; fomewhat
inclined to extravagance, hut raoft commonly
from good motives ; eaiily impofed upon by fifti-
tious tales of diftrefs ; and though convinced of the
impofftion, cannot reftrain himfelf from tending
his hand, in indulgence of his fenfibility to the
next objeft that claims his benevolence; he will
fuffer no very great hardfhips, nor will he enjoy a
c?)nfideraille fhare of happinefs ; but on the* whole
his fituatian will be rather better than worfe ; he
will have feveral children, but more girls than
boys, and will be careful in educating them, and
providing for them.
The eve that is fmall, but advanced in'the head,
(hews the man or woman to be of a quick wit,
found confutation, lively genius, agreeable, con­
ven tion , and good morals ; but inclined to jea-
loufy, though never without fome foundation;
careful1and attentive to bufinefs, and never neg-
1eftfid of his occupation whatever may be his
fituation in life ; with iucli a perfon you mail be

iomewhat guarded in your expreflions, as he w ill,
be apt to fufpeft you of a defign of giving him of­
fence ; He will not eafily reconcile himfelf to a
fedentary life, but will be for fome employment
that will require frequent change of place ; he
will be pun&uai in fulfilling his engagements, and
very much difpleafed if he linds himfelf difap-
pointed in thole of o.hers ; in love matters, he
will be very warm, and not eafily reconciled to
one perfon, unlefs that perfon is very amiable,' and
iludies the viciilitudes of his tafte, adapting him­
felf to it when neceifary; he will be, in general,
profperous in his undertakings, and exceedingly
prolific.
The man or woman whofe eyes are funk in his
head, is of a jealous, diilruuful, malicious, and
envious nature ; deceitful and hypocritical in his
words and a&ions, never to be depended upon,
unlefs his intereft* or revenge excite him to punc­
tuality ; in either of tliofe cafes no man can be
more faithful to his promifes ; his chief ddight will
be in ihowing his love, cunning in over-reach­
ing others ; and he will be fo vain glorious, as to
boaft of it among his aifociates, whom he wil]
not fpare, but will endeavour to divert their re-*
fentmerrt by a laugh ; he will take more pleafure
iri lewd love, than in that that is lawful, and .will
have many children, whom he will, if pofiible,
avoid providing for during his own life time.
The mafi or woman who fquints, or has his
eyes turned awry, will be of a penurious difpofiti-
on, but punftual in his dealings, more for the
fake of gaining the character of an honeft man,
than from any innate principle ; he will be fly, cun­
ning and iniinuating, of a fawning, cringing,
mean difpofition to thofe from' whom he'may expert
advantage

advantage or emolument’,as well as to thofe whom.
h£ means to injure ; but as foon as he finds his
opportunity of pouring his vengeance on the lat-
ter, he will do it with a malignancy that is detec­
table ; in his amours he will be intemperate, and
indifferent to their being publicly known ; he will
be tenacious of his own fecrets, and prodigal of
thofe of others, if he thinks he can gain by be­
traying them ; he will be cautious and impenetra­
ble when he drinks, though addi&ed to it by in­
clination.— In marriage he will feek intereft, ra­
ther than love, and will be complaifant to his wife,
if (he is fubmiflive to him ; but if fhe is otherwife
he will be cruel ; he will have many children, but
will accumulate much wealth.
W e {hall now proceed to inform our rfeaders^
of the judgment they are to form of a perfon by
the oolour of the eyes,, which, though generally--
very various, are yet diitinguiihed into fix prin­
cipal claffes, viz. the black eye, the hazle eyet
tfmblue eye, the grey eye, the wall eye, and the
red eye.
The colour of the eye is attached to no parti­
cular fize or fituation, but as its conftrutlion is,
all the parts of the body, the moll complicated and
lingular, we will bee leave, before we proceed
any farther, to give fome little account of this or­
gan ; we mean with refpeft to its communication
with the other effential lources of the conceptions
and paflions of man ; its delicacy is fuch, that it is
,fenfible of the fmalleft injury, as it is likewife the
channel through which the imagination receives
its firft impremons, and through which, it again
fends them forth in the moll unequivocal man-
ner; for to every man who will give himfelf the
trouble of a little reflettion. it will appear evident
' that
C 32 3

that, the tongue can at command of the fpcakcr?
give utterance to ideas, v/hich the imagination
never cherifhed ; ar;d in this cafe with very little
trouble you will obferve that thefe crude and
undigelled ideas, are delivered in a forced, harlh,
and nnnatural kind of cxpreilion; whereas the
language of the eyes is clear, convincing, and in­
telligible ; this evidently proves the immediate
connexion which the eye has by its tubes, nerves,
. and ligaments ; with the feveral cavities of the
brain, from which the imagination fends her well
formed plans to the eye, and there places them in
fo clear a point of view, that a judicious perfon
will immediately know by the eye, if the expreffi-
ons of the lips are true.or falfe ; a moil eilential
fcience to perfons in all ranks, and from which
the conduft of the perfon you converfe with, will
be inflantly gathered, in the intercourfe he then
propofes.
It will appear equally certain, tthat the eye has
an immediate relation to .'the heart, from the
embtions of pleafure, anger, joy, fear, or other
paflion, which the latter feels irrefiitibly, when any
objeft is conveyed to it through the eye that is,
capable ol producing thofe emotions.—The heart
is the feat of affection ; the brain, the feat of fancy ;
• they both receive their, impreflions through the
eye, and fend them* back fo forcibly by it, that
the aifeftion or idea that is' predominant at the
moment, will ihine out in the eye without equi­
vocation, and all the efforts of the judgment, all
the arts the mind is capable of, cannot for an in-
Ham fupprefs, or even difguife, the language of the
eye ; whereas all the mufcles are in the powrer o f
the perfon, who, in the Height of joy, fear, plea­
sure, or anger ; can feeiri calm, unruffled, and tin-

ceflant to and fro, and is .evidently diilorted from
its natural fituation ; in joy, it fparkles, but remains
eafyin itspoilure, dry, and advances forward as if
to meet the obje£l it delights in ; in pleafure it is
moift, fparkling, fixed, and of a peculiar foftnefs
and languor, which it is impoffible to defcribe ; iu
fear, it grows dim, feems to retire into the head,
and the eyelids approach towards each other, as if
to fave it from the danger, or to hide the danger
from it; every other paffion produces an efreft
upon the eye, which feparately to detail would bf
tedious; it requires only a little obfervation
and experience to become perfeil in their feveral
revolutions ip every fituation of life, and we ihall
therefore proceed, without any other preface, to
fhew what may be gathered from the colour of
the eye in man or woman; for what is faid of on^,
in this cafe, will hold good of both.
A black eye is lively, brifk, and penetrating;
and proves the perfon who poffefles it, to be o f a
fprightly wit, lively converfation, not eafily im*
pofed upon, of a found underilanding; but if taken
on the weak fide, may be led aftray for a while ;
but whilll in the vortex of error, will look back
, with regret^ and ftruggle until he has recover­
ed him felf; his greateftfoible if it can be called one*
will be the paifion of love, in which he will
fcarcely keep bounds ; he will be fubieft to fudden
ftarts of anger and jealoufy, but will be eafily ap.
peafed; he will be impatient for early marriage*
and will never be contented unlefs his heart k
engaged in love and friendihip; he will be fin-
cere and liberal in both ; by his warmth in purfu-
ing his projefts, he will expofe himfelf to frequent
dijiapppointments, and vexations; his eagemeis in

die enjoyment of connubial pleafure, will in part
diiappoint his intentions of a numerous ifTue, un-
lefs he meets with a mate of his own chara&er ,
and conftitution, then he will have many chil­
dren.
A hazle eye (hews the perfon to be of a fubtie,
piercing, and frolickfome difpofition, rather in­
clined to be arch, and fometimes mifehievous ; a
great joker, and will 6ften offend his friends for
the fake of his jeft, but good natured at the b o ^
tom; with refpeft to temporal affairs, he will be
neither anxious nor negligent, but preferve a juft
medium ; he will be .ftrQngly inclined to love, and
not over delicate in the means of gratifying that
propenfity, and will bring himfelf into fome in­
conveniences on that account, but will feldom
involve himfelf in great dangers ; he will be mode­
rately affeftionate, and will have many children ;
and upon the whole, not unprofperous in his un­
dertakings.
A blue eye fhew’s the perfon to be of a meek and
gentle temper, affable and good-natured, credu­
lous, and incapable of violent attachments; ever
modeft, cool, and undifturbed by turbulent paf-
fions ; of a ftrong and capacious memory, but
better adapted to trifles than to matters of great
m om ent; indolent, yet of a temper fo fcrupulous
as rather to incroach upon his difpofition, than
negleft his duty ; verv temperate in the ufe of loVe,
but if once engaged in affeftion, exceedingly hard
to be detached ; in conftitution, neither robuft nor
delicate, apt to be fwayed by the laft opinion,
fubjeft to no violent imprefTion from the vicifTi-
ttides of life, whether good or bad, and will have
but few children, moftly girls!

A- grey eye denotes the perfon to be of weak
intellects, devoid of wit, but a plain plodding
downright drudge, that will aft as he is fpirited up
by others ; he will have but few innate ideas, and
will be flow in learning any thing that requires
attention ; however, he wilh be juft to the beft of
his- underfianding, and will wrong no body if he
knows the aftion to be wrong, but will be very
eafily perfuaded to adopt falfe opinions ; he will
be of a cold and phlegmatic conftitution, liable to
frequent, but flight fits of ficknefs, and will rather
fubmit to, than 'defire the pleafures of love; he
will not have many children, nor will he enjoy
much inward fatisfaftion, though not liable to
any degree of mifery; his life feldom will exceed
iixty years. ,
A wall eye denotes the perfon to be of a hafty,
paflionate, and ungovernable temper ; fubjeft to
fudden and violent anger, and in his fits thought-
lefs of the mifebief he mav' do ; haughty to his
equals and fuperiors, but mild and affable to his
inferiors, unlcfs he fees in tliem fome ungene­
rous principle; he will not be tenacious of his
money when an opportunity offers of laying it out
well ; he will be a patron to the opprefled, and a
proteftor of the innocent; and will, upon the
whole, not prove an unamiable character; he will
be patient of neceflary labour ilidefatigab1
y induf-
trious, and punctually honeft; but he will not be
as ardent in love matters, as might be expefted,
though he will have many children, for the m oil
part boys.
A rod, or as it is vulgarly called, a faucer eye,
denotes the perfon to be felfiih, deceitful, proud,
ingenuous, and furious in the paflion of anger;
fertile in the invention of plots, and indefatigable

„in his family, anxious for riches, and fufpicious
that others are forming defigns againft him ; he
is ever watchful for advantages, and intrepid in
purpofes, carelefs of life, when the expofing of
it can contribute to the gratification of his inte-
reited or other views ; he is ardent in love, but
ftrongly attached to the. firft object that catches
his fancy ; he will have many .children, and live to
fee old age.
From the eye, it is natural for us to defcend
to the nofe, which, being a leading and /prominent
feature, ever in light, will indicate the difpofition
and temper of a man in a great meafurc ; and when
compared with the other lineaments, will be fuch a
clue as mult lead us into his fecret foul, and deve-
lope all his mazes and intricacies, in fpite of all his
difguifes, affeblation and hypocrify ; but as it would
be impoilible to fpccify the infinite variety of
nofes that is to be found among mankind, with
the feveral indications that may be drawn from
them, we .will confine ourfelves to a lmall num­
ber ;— and firft,
A nofe that comes even on the ridge, flat on
the fides, with little or no hollow between the
eyes, declares the man to be fulky, infolent, dis­
dainful, treacherous, and felf-fufficient; if it has
a point defcending over the noftrils, he is avari­
cious and unfeeling« vain glorious, fjuperficial,
and ignorant; yet endeavouring to* impofe him-
felf upon others as a man of knowledge and un-
derftanding; he is peevifh, jealous, quick in
refentment, but too cowardly to take a generous,
revenge.

of fcience, and of a very light under(landing,
conceited and pufillanimous ; he is quarrelfome
when he thinks he has an advantage, and careful
of what he can acquire.
The nofe that is fmall, (lender, and peaked,
(hews the perfon to be of a fearful difpofition,
jealous, fretful, and infidious ; ever fufpicious of
thofe about him, catching at every word that he
can interpret to his own advantage, to ground
a difpute upon y fond of carping and bickering,
never at red in his mind, from the imagination
that others do not think as well of him as he
would wiih ; he is lively in the purfuit of what­
ever he takes a liking to know, and curious to
know every thing that is faid and done.
The nofe that is fmall, tapering, round in the
noftrils, and cocked up, ihews the perfon to
be ingenious, fmart, of a quick apprehenfion, gid­
dy, and feklom looking into confequences; but
generous, rather to a fault, and candid, agreeable

avoiding to give offence, but firm and refolute
in doing himfelf juilice, when he receives an in­

And having now faid all that occurs to us, con­
cerning the moil common, we will proceed to
the next general tell-tale of the human mind, the
mouth.
s The lips that are thick, foft, and long, an­
nounce the perfon to be of weak intelle6ls, cre-
. chitons, and (lightly pcevifh, but by a little footh-

is eaiily perfunded to undertakings, but if he fees
them tending to wickednefs, he will recoil, and
never engage in them ; he is invariably upright
in his conduci, and of a timorous and balhful
temper.
It the underlip is much thicker than the upper,
and more prominent, the perfon is ot a weak un-
derftanding, but artful, knavifh, and given to
chicanery to the full extent of his ability ; greedy
of money, of a brutal, harih, and unfociable temper
apt to confide too much in the judgment of another,
and amorous, but not fo far as to hurt his own in-
tereft ; imperious to thofe who depend on him,
and cringing to all from whom he may expect
advantage ; he is of a cowardly. nature, unlefs
flrongly excited bv another.
The lips that are moderately plump and even,
declare the perfon to be good-humoured, humane,
fenfible, judicious and juft ; neither giddy nor
torpid, but purfuing, in every particular, a juft
medium.
The lips that are thin, fhew the perfon to be
of a quick and lively imagination, ardent, in the
purfuit of knowledge in whatever he applies
to, indefatigable in labour, not too much attached
to money ; eager in the pleafures of love, and
kind with fome degree of partiality ; more brave
than otherwife, and firmly attached, but difficult
to be brought to attachment.
The lips that are thin and funk inwards, de­
note thè perfon to be of a fubtle, refentful and
perfevering difpofition ; evedafting in hatred, and
never fparing any pains to compafs his revenge ;
in love or friendship, much more moderate and
uncertain.

to follow nature in her playfulnefs, in that infi­
nite variety of little infignificant diftin&ions,
which Ihe makes in this, as well as every other
part of man; we will therefore proceed to give
our obfcrvations on the chin.
The chin that is round, with a hollow between
it and the lip, ihews the perfon to be of a good-
humoured clifpofition, kind and honeit; he will
not voluntarily do gaols injury, though fometimes
he may be led into it by the perfuaiion of others ;
but he foon repents, and makes amends as far as
in his power; he is fincere in his friendfhip,
and ardent in his love ; his underitariding is good,
and his genius capacious ;— If he has a dimple, it
makes him better.
The chin that comes down flat, from the edge
of the lip, and ends in a kind of chifel form,
ihews the perfon to be filly, credulous, jealous,
ill-tempered, and greedy of unmerited honours
and praife ; capricious, wavering** and uniteady;
lie is ever forming projects, and has no fooner
compaifed them, than he finds fault, and wiihes
them undone; if his fortune will allow it, he will
deftroy the work of many months, in the vain ima­
gination of gaining an advantage, which will not
be equivalent 16 the expence ; he will aflfefr great
modcity in prefence of others, though he will
not fcruple the vileft aftions when he thinks him-
felf fecure from difeovery :— a dimple makes no
alteration.
The chin that is pointed upwards, fhews the
perfon to be deeply given to contrivances, pro­
portioned to his abilities in fortune, and under-
ihmding; he cv

plots and fehemes on one thing or another, and

to bring them to an ¡flue; however fairly he be-

O f the face in general, we will fay, that the
perfon whofe features are ftrong, coarfe, and un-
pleafant to the eye, is of a felhfh, brutal, rough*
and unfociable difpofition: greedy of money*
harfh in expreflion, but will fometimes fawn with
a bad grace to gain his ends.
The face that is plump, round, and ruddy, de­
notes the perfon to be of an agreeable temper, a
fafe companion, hearty and jovial, fond of com­
pany, and defirous and deferving of friendfhip :
of a folid wit, found principles, and a clear un-
deritanding; he is faithful in love, though fome-
timesin an unguarded moment he may be led aftray,
but he foon returns* and proves more affeftionate
than before. '
The face that is thin, fmooth, and even, with
well proportioned features, (hews the perfon to
be of a good difpofition, but lively, penetrating*
and aftive; fomewhat inclined to fufpicion, yet
facetious, and of an agreeable converfation; aili-
duous in purfuit of knowledge* and ilrongly ad-
difted to the delights of love.

jaws, is of a reitlefs, and thinking difpofition,

Of P A L M I S T R Y,
.O f thefeveral Lines of both Hands, and what they
Jeverally prognojlicate.
T
HE palms of the hands contain a great variety
of lines or indentures, running in different di­
rections, every one of which bears a certain relation
to the events of a perfon’s life ; and from them,
with the molt infallible certainty, you can tell
every circumftance that will happen to yourfelf
or any other, by combining them properly to­
gether ; but here we muff beg leave to undeceive
our readers concerning a very effential point,
which we find that our predeceffors have in gene­
ral omitted ; and thatT
is, that every line, accord­
ing as it has performed a part of its function, lofea
that charafteriftic which was allotted to forefhew
that particular circumftance, and affumes a dif­
ferent afpeft; but whether this variation confiftfc
in a greater depth ol its former impreffion, or if
it appears lefs vifible in the fpot that foreboded
that event, or by a certain involution of its direc­
tion to the one fide or to the other, it is almoft im-
poflible to particularize, as thefe changes and alte­
rations depend in a great meafure on the peculiar
nature of the circumftance itfell, and of its weight
or levity in the great fcale of human viciftitudes;
we muft therefore, content ourfelves with ftre-
nuouily recommending to our readers to pay an
unwearied attention to this objeft, and will moil:

undoubtedly reap an ampié harveft of moil ex­
cellent knowledge for their pains.
W e íhall firit give the names of the feveral
lines as they hold their places, and then particula­
rize their qualities.
There are five principal lines in each hand,
called by the fame names, but as they frequently
bear different charaóleriftic, fo are their prognos­
tics different; the chief line, and that on which
perfons of the profeffion lay the greateil flrefs, is
the line of life, which generally takes its rife
where the thumb joint plays with the wrifl on
the infide; and runs in an oblique direction to
the infide of the innermoft joint of the fore-
finger.
The next is the line of death, which feparates-
the fleihy part of the hand on the liule finger's
fide, from the hollow of the hand, running in
different direftions in different people.
The table line originates with the line of life,
at the wrifl, and runs through the hollow of the
hand towards the middle finger.
The girdle of Venus takes its courfe from the
extremity of the innermoft joint of the little fin­
ger, and forming a curve, terminates between the
fore and middle fingers.
The line of fortune ftrikes from behind the
ball, or mount of the fore-finger, acrofs the palm,
and line of life, and loofes itfelf in or near the
fleihy part of the hand on the little finger's
fide.
It would be impoffible to give names to .all the
other lines, and indeed it would be needlefs, as
they only tend to illuftrate and explain the other
lines; we íhall now proceed to give the remarks
to be made on thefe five lines:
N > E.

\
N . B . Particular attention muil be paid to the
age of the perfon who coniuks.
If the line of life is crolled or interfered by-
other lines at or near the wrift, the perfon will
meet -with ficknefs in the beginning of life, and
the degree of ficknefs will be proportioned to the
fize, length, and breadth of the intervening lines;
the fame is to be obferved of the other parts of the
line, fo that according to the fituation of the croif-
\ig lines upon the line of life, you can precifely
tell at what age the ficknefs will come on ; and ac­
cording to the depth and length, of the crofTmg
line, you know whether the fit will b e fevere. or
of long duration. If the line of life runs fair and
uninterrupted, the perfon will enjoy good health ;
and according to its length towards the outfide
of the forefinger, you can judge if the perfon
will live long, as the longer the line, the longer
the life.
If the line of death is fhortr, and runs even,
without being broken or divided, it ihews that
^ the perfon will enjoy a good length of days, and
not be« fubjefted to many maladies; but if,it is
interrupted, it evidently ihews that the perfon
will be endangered by illnefs, but by the care of
providence will recover. If this line ends ab­
ruptly, and with a broad point, it ihews that the
perfon <vill die fuddenly ; if it goes off in a taper­
ing point, the lait illnefs will be flow, and con-
fuming by degrees.; if it breaks off into feveral
branches, the perfon will be afflifted with more
diforders than one at the fame time ; if other lines
run acrofs it, the perfon will be of a weakly and
infirm habit of body ; often confined by infirmi­
ties, and incapable of following any hard or la­
borious bufineis.

When the table line is broad, flrong and well
marked, it {hews the perfon to be of a found con-
ilitution, and a peaceable, contented mind ; if it
is broken, it fhews for every break a violent in­
terruption to happinefs ; if thefe breaks happen
towards the part ne^t to the wriil, he will be
croiled in love, and either be difappointed in the
perfon he has fixed his affeQions on, or be fad-
died with a perfon of a difobliging temper, and
abufive tongue ; if towards the middle, he will lofe'
his children, or decline in wealth ; if towards the
line of fortune, it threatens feparation, and if
nearer to the middle finger, poverty and diftrefs.
The girdle of Venus when it goes on fair, and
well marked, Ihews that the perfon will be prol-
perous in love, fair in his dealings with the fair fex#
and be fincerely beloved ; he will obtain a partner
for life, of a fortune adequate to his own, fweet
tempered, faithful and affciflionate ; but if it is in­
terrupted at its beginning near the little finger,
he will meet with early difappointments in love;
if towards the middle of the line, he will ruin his
health, and injure his fortune with lewd profti-
tutes; if near the end, he will be foolilhly amo­
rous in his old age, ftill expending to gain the
heart of a woman, but never will obtain it-; If
this line is interfered with croffes that run quite
through it, you are not to expeft fincere love
from any body, but that kind of violent defire
that foon exhaufts itfell and vaniihes as fuddenly as
it took rife ; if this line inclines towards the fin­
gers you will continue amorous through life, but
if it takes its dire&ion the contrary way, reafon
will overcome paflion, and in the decline of
life, you will look upon the fex with calmnefs,
if not with indifference; if it is frequently indent-
. [ 46 ]
ed, that is to fay, if it has many little hollows,
you will be inclined to many women or men, but
attached to none, defirous of being beloved by
fome one, and difappointed by all; if thefe in- -
dentures happen at the little finger, this dif-
pofition will be in early life, if at the forefinger,
to old age.
Other perfons who have pretended to this
fcience, have called this line by different names,
which we cslll the Line of Fortune; its proximity
to the girdle of Venus fhews that there is a itrong
kindred between them, and their diftance at their
two extremities, clearly points out, that love is
inconfiftent with childhood, and old age : yet, in
thofe where the crofs lines approach from the one
to -the other near their ends, prove that the per­
fons were, or will be fufceptible of love in child­
hood or old age. For example, if the crofs lines
are at the beginning of the girdle of Venus, and
bear towards the tail of the line of fortune, it evi­
dently indicates that the perfon was fufceptible of
love at an earlier period than ufual ; if thefe lines
of communication are croffed by other fmall lines,
the perfon has been difappointed in his wiihes, or
feverely puniihed for gratifying them ; if plain and
ilraight, and without tranfverle lines, he has been
fuccefstul ; if the lines take their rife from the tail
of the girdle; and lead towards the head of the line
of fortune, the perfon will be amorous in his old
age, and according to the fituation of the trani-
verfe lines, will be fuccefsful or unfortunate in
his amours : if the line of fortune runs fmooth,
broad, and clear, the perfon will enjoy affluence
through life, and be profperous in all his under­
takings ; if it is interfered by ihort lines at the be­
ginning, near the forefinger, it denotes that the
perfon
[ 47 3

perfon was born .poor, or at leaft with a {mail
capital ; if thefe lines occur toward the middle,
at either end, he will be profperous in the firft
and lalt of life ; but meet with difappointments at
mid-age : if the crofs lines occur at the extremity
and not before, he will die poor and diftrelled.- If
tranfverfe lines, crofted by others, pafs from the
line of life to the line of fortune, the perfon will be
engaged in quarrels and broils, or lawfuits and dift*
union with his neighbours.
If the hollow palm of the hand, which fome
call the plain of Mars, is full of crofs lines run­
ning into each other, the perfon will be of a hu-
morfome, -uneven, and telly -temper, jealous, and
hafty, quarrclfomc, and fighting, and endeavour­
ing to let others by the ears ; he will meet with
very frequent misfortunes, and bear them very
uneafily, whereas if the hollow or palm of the
hand has none but the unavoidable lines, that is
to lay, thofe that mult unavoidably pafs through
it, he will be of a fweet and amiable difpojition,
full of fenfibility, gratitude, and leve, faithful,
benevolent and kind; and though fubjeft to
croftes, Ioffes, and difappointments, will bearthem
with an even and agreeable temper ; from this
part chiefly, we recommend to perfons, to chufe
their companions for life, either i n friendihip or
marriage.
W e fhall conclude this Chapter with a few re­
marks on the mount, or ball of the thumb, which
hears a peculiar analog'/ to the event§ of a per-
fon’s life, with refpett to difputes, quarrels, and
lawfuits ; if this mount has many long ftraight
lines reaching from the thumb’“
to' the line of life,
they ihew that the perfon will have fevcral perfonal
encounters, either with hands, clubs, piftols, or
fwords,
[ 4» ]
Digitized by Google
[ 49 ]
fwords; but it the lines are curved or crooked,
they will indicate lawfuits, and according to the
degree of crookednefs, they will be long or ihort ;
but if thefe lines end in a ilraight direftion to­
wards the line oi life, they will end profperoufly,
whether encounters or lawfuits ; if otherwife, they
will be attended with an unfavourable iifue ; the
nearer to the line of life thefe lines begin, the la­
ter in the perfon’s life, the quarrels or lawfuits
will take place; and the nearer to the line of life,
they and the later in life they will terminate.
Were the compafs to which we have limited
ourfelves even more extenfive, I do not know
that we could fay more on this Chapter; but as
we have before remarked, we muff neceflarily
leave a good deal to the fagacity of the reader.

And firft, it is eflentially necefTary to know the
fize of the mole, its colour, whether it is perfect­
ly round, oblong, or angular, becaufe each of
thofe will add to, or diminiih the force of the in-*

it forebodes quarrelling in your cups, and ill-
temper to your family whilit you are in a Hate of
intoxication; if hearts, it fhews cordiality and
affection between the parties ; if diamonds, your
feaft will be from home, probably in the country ;
if clubs, the occaiion of the meeting will be up­
on fome bargain or agreement; if your ace of
hearts is in the neighbourhood of coat cards of
both fexes, with clubs near, it will be about match­
making ; if all the coat cards are kings or knaves,
or both, it will concern the buying or felling of
fome perfonal property; if all queens, it will re­
gard reconciliation between parties; and it queens
and knaves, it will be about the reconciliation and
reunion of a manned couple.

Here you will find that the King of Diamonds
has formed a defign upon the perfon who is repre-
fented by the King of Hearts, an honeft, good-
natured man, to wheedle fome money frorji him,
which is {hewn by the Ace of Clubs; but the
Knave of Hearts, the King’s beft friend, hinders
him, by threatening and quarrelling with him,
ihewn by the Tray of Diamonds. King of Dia­
monds, now t.urns his defign againit the King of
Spades, by pretending friendfiup to him, who is
a country perfon of iome wealth, and loft a near
relation lately, either a man whom lie dearly lov­
ed, or his no lefs beloved wife, who had an
equal affeClion for him. The King of Spades,
writes a letter; the Ace of Diamonds to his
friend the Knave of Spades, to confuit him about
the friendihip, and whether he ihall give the
money. The friend difapproves of both, and
charges him with fome unfortunate connection in
the love line ; and ftrenuoufly recommends him
to the friendihip of the King of Clubs, a man
of fortune; but who has an unlawful commerce
with a woman, who does not care for him, yet
occafions his feparating from his own wife, who
at this time is in the country with a near relation,
(a widow) who condoles with her, becaufe fh e

wife with a large fortune, but rather acidified t*>
drinking, by which fhe will injure him, and bring
herfelf to an untimely end.
You find again in the perpendicular examina­
tion, a man given to rambling in Search bf riches,
though he has enough already, and will marry
when old; again you have an ill-minded man un­
der colour ot friend(hip, Seeking all in his power
to injure another man, in which he is but too
fuccefsful. The third column ihews you, a man
disappointed in his courtfhip to a woman, whb
endeavours to aifign him over to her acquaintance,
a known wanton, whom ihe impofes upon him ;
but who makes him a good wile, and brings him
very dutiful and refpeftful children. The fourth
column denotes a violent, and long attachment
to illicit pleafure; from which, however,' arifes
fome profit intermixed with uneafmefs and difap-
pointment. The fifth column, ihews a fudden
rife of wealth and confcquence to a man, who,
though tolerably inclined upon the whole, has
formed an unjuft defign upon a married woman,
whom he fucceeds in corrupting. The fixth co­
lumn points out a gentleman in the country, of a
large well improved landed property; who is in
treaty for a Second marriage, which terminates in
drunken diflipation on both fides. The feventh
column, ihews a wealthy man taking a partner,
who by an imprudent marriage involves hirafelf in
difficulties, which terminate in his ruin. Th$
eighth column ihews the death of a very near re*
lation, who had a peculiar friendship for you, and
would have made you quite happy, had he not
died fo foon. The ninth column, points out si
lawfuit inftituted againft you by the relations o f
your wife for a part of her fortune; but that hy

»leans of her precautions and prudent conduit,
you will in the end get the better of themf and
be happy; which is my very fincere and hearty
wifh.
The impoflibility of giving all the combinations
of a deck of cards, induces us to leave to our ju­
dicious readers to follow the plan we have here
laid down; by which they will never fail of fore­
knowing the ieveral events that are to happen; if
they chufe to learn the fate of other friends, let
them appoint them kings, queens, and knaves, and
the cards next to them will have a reference to
their future fortune.
There remains now the more difficult part of our
talk, as in Dreams, there generally are fo many
various circumftances that may bias the import of
the main intention of the w hole; however, from
about twenty thoufand dreams on which we have
been confulted, and which we carefully fet down
in our memorandum book, with all their feveral
inlets and outlets, we have felefted thofe heads
which moil frequently occur, and give them with
©ur interpretations, which on ftritt enquiry, our
correfpondents, and the perions who have conful­
ted us, have acknowledged invariably true; for
we allure, our readers, that our defign is not to
impoie upon their judgment, or miflead their fancy;
had that been the cafe, we fliould have endeavour­
ed by a pompous preface, to engage the imagina­
tion in our favour, and thus prepoiiefs the under-
ilanding by a mafs of fafeinating phrafes, fucli as
we find in other books of a lefs ufcful and attrac­

How to arrange the Dregs remaining in your:
Cup, together with the different Indications of
thefuture Events. •
T he difficulty of this undertaking is obvious; but
our defire of giving every fatis fa&ion to our kind
and indulgent readers, has induced us to under­
take iu
OU muil not take the coffee thatfirfl comes
from your pot, as it is likely to prove too
clear to anfwer your purpofe ; but when you ap­
proach to the dregs, then pour it out into your
cup, let it fettle, and, when you have fipped up
all except the lediment, turn the cup round, in
fuch a manner as, that it may flick to the Tides ot
it all round : this being done, lay your cup in­
verted on your faucer until ?.ll the moiflure is
drained away; take up your cup now, and oh-
ferve to begin at the right fide of your thumb,
making your remarks all about until you come to
the thumb againon the other fide.
If you fee a clear, narrow part between two-
lines, it fignifies a public road; obferve the little
atoms in this paffage, and their diilance from your
thumb, as alfo their direction, whether the thick
part of them are inclined towards you, or from
you ; if the former, your beil beloved is coming to
fee you ; if the latter, he is going away from you ;
the farther this road is from your thumb, the
greater diilance he i from you; if it is moltly on

to come ; if moftlv on the -right fide, he is on
nis arrival; if thi$ clear or white part is long and
broad, he is corning by fea ; if you fee the refem-
blance of feveral houfes on or near a road or
white fpace, it fignifies a great city, or fea-port; if
there is no large atom in the road or fpace, you
will yourfelf foon perform a journey or voyage;
if you fee the likenefs, but of one large houfe
with few people or atoms about it, you will be
fnarried in a fhort time, that being the emblem of
a church ; if there is a great crowd, you will at­
tend the funeral of fome dear friend if there ap­
pears, a great many round fmall white fpots on any
part of the cup,, it denotes that you will fhortly
receive a large fum of money; the nearer your
thumb on the right hand fide, the fooner you will-
get i t ; if you perceive the fembiance of ¿'coach,
which is eafily difiinguiihed, you will be fpeedily
raifed to honour and dignity ; if the likenefs Ihould
be a liorfe, you will be married to a perfon much
above your own condition ; if' you obferve the
fimilitude. of a gallows, which may happen, we re­
commend to you to mend your own morals, or cau­
tion any of your acquaintance, whom yoihknow
to be vicious, of the threatened danger.
