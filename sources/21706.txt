FOREWORD
Mr. A. Campbell Holms, the author of this
general outline of the Fundamental I;acts of
Spiritualism, entered the field of literature on
Psychic Science and Spiritualism, after having at-
tained a prominent and enviable position in the
world of "Physical" Science.
The author is a Naval Architect by profession,
with a life-long Scientific and Technical training.
His book, "Practical Shipbuilding," in two large
volumes, has been accepted all over the world and
is now in its Fifth Edition.
:r...Ir. Holms is a Scotsman by birth, and was a
profound sceptic and materialist until his attention
was accidentally attracted to Spiritualism, when
he began to investigate carefully every phase of
Psychical Research, and made a most exhaustive
and critical study of its extensive literature as
well as the numerous records of supernormal
phenomena contained therein. The author's
studies resulted in his large book, ''The Facts of
Psychic Science and Philosophy,'' published in

sive, simple and practical treatment of this com-
plex but intensely interesting subject.
"The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism" sets

spiritualistic phenomena lin simple though lucid

PREFACE
The purpose of this little book is to enable
those approaching the subject of Spiritualism for
the first time, to acquire easily and at small ex-
pense a general knowledge of the facts on which
it is founded. These facts proclaim truths which
are of the utmost importance to the welfare of
mankind. Truth should prevail at all costs, where-
ever it may lead. Those concerning the spiritual
nature of man should be proclaimed far and wide,
for only through their realization can the ·present-
day materialism and many unhappy religious dog-
mas be swept aside.
Readers who desire evidence as to the facts,
and fuller information than this little book offers,
are recommended to consult the author's com-
prehensive work : "The Facts of Psychic Science
and Philosophy: Collated and Discussed."
A. CAMPBELL HoLMs.

THE FUNDAMENTAL FACTS
of
SPIRITUALISM
The majority of people are never brought face
to face with anything suggesting the miraculous
or "supernatural," and, consequently, they go
through life in the belief that nothing ever hap-
pens that cannot be accounted for in a perfectly
natural way. This, no doubt, is the reason why
n1ost people are inclined to dismiss as fables all
accounts of psychic phenomena. Such phenomena
happen, nevertheless, and are familiar occurrences
to Spiritualists and students of Psychic Science.
As these investigators make no secret of their
experiences it is odd that so few of the general
public seem to know of them. There are several
reasons for this; one is the fact that no one finds
it worth while to relate his wonderful experi-
ences to strangers, when he feels pretty sure that
he will not be believed, but be looked upon pity-
ingly as mentally unbalanced. Few newspapers
care to publish serious accounts of psychic phe-
nomena for fear of shocking the prejudices or
religious susceptibilities of their readers; if, there-

fore, they do publish them, it is usually with
contemptuous derision. If fraud is imputed, as
it usually is, the account is sure of ready accept-
ance, because the public likes a natural explana-
tion of the dreaded supernatural. The police
prosecutions of fortune-tellers-who may be per-
fectly genuine clairvoyants-is always good
"copy''! for the newspapers. Many books have
been published dealing with every branch of Spiri-
tualis·m and Psychic Science, but as the general
public has no curiosity to examine a subject
which it has been taught to associate with credul-
ity and fraud, such books are not in demand and
so are seldom seen in the bookshops.
In the study of all subjects it is the universally
accepted rule to begin by reading authoritative
books, so as to ascertain what others before us
have already seen and done and what conclusions
they have come to as a result of their researches.
Unfortunately, in the case of Physic Science, this
common-sense rule is quite commonly set aside
even by those who do not deny its wisdom ; and
it is doubtless because of this that so much ignor-
ance still prevails among educated people as to
the reality and significance of the fundamental
facts of Spiritualism.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism
It is proposed in this book to describe briefly
the essential facts, the reality of which is well
established. The reality of an alleged phenomenon
is believable if a sufficiency of credible evidence
is produced in its favour. The blind man believes
in the moon because the evidence he receives from
others is overwhelming, and we also believe, on
similar evidence, a vast number of facts which
we cannot personally verify. In the case of
supernormal phenomena most people prefer the
evidence of their own senses, and this they can
have if they themselves witness them.
Psychic phenomena can be verified personally
by anyone, but as they are not on public sho\v
they must be sought, and the seeking may in-
volve the expenditure of time, money and patience.
Private circles do nC?t care to admit strangers,
because they are likely to disturb the mental at-
mosphere and prejudice the phenomena. If the
necessary conditions are provided, phenomena can
be observed in one's own home, but the prepara-
tory work may occupy a long period. Some of
the best mediums have only succeeded in develop...
ing their particular gifts after years of patient
endeavour. Good reliable mediums are rare. Some
are willing that the public should profit by their

gift, usually, of course, at a price, but many in
private life are unknown. Many keen psychic
students have spent large sums of money and
travelled thousands of miles to prove the reality
of a particular phenom.enon occurring through a
specially gifted mediutn resident in some far-off
place.
The majority of people, when their interest is
first aroused in the phenomena of Spiritualism,
inunediately rush off to the first available mediun1,
but as they do not know what to expect or the
significance of what occurs, they learn little or
nothing and are often puzzled and disappointed.
If anything apparently supernortnal happens,
while the credulous at once conclude that a mira-
cle has occurred, the sceptic jumps precipitately
to the conclusion that clever trickery is a sufficient
explanation. Sometimes the latter are right, for
unhappily there have always been fraudulent me-
diums, who easily deceive those \vithout expert
knowledge. But deception is no more rife among
the professional exponents of Spiritualism than
among those in other professions. The dishonest
practitioner is to .be found in ·every community,
without exception.

professional mediums and promiscuous sitters
should be avoided, for, apart from the possibility
of deception on the part of the medium, unknown
psychic influences may be present which may de-
base the phenomena and result in wrong conclu-
sions. Those who desire reliable personal ex-
perience should, after some preliminary study,
form a small home circle composed of congenial
friends of the right sort who are known to be
level-headed, trustworthy and kindly in their
thoughts. If the sittings are continued regularly
over a sufficiently long period, the mediumship of
one or more of the sitters will be developed and
the patience of the circle finally rewarded by the
occurrence of phenomena, both mental and ob-
jective, which will increase in strength and im-
portance. Rules for the conduct of such circles
are given in the Appendix.
In the following pages a brief description is
given of the major mediumistic phenomena. Some
of these in the objective class are so exceedingly
marvellous that many find difficulty in accepting
their reality without personal experience. Unfor-
tunately the higher phenomena of Spiritualism,
although frequently seen in the past, are now
very uncommon, so much so that they are usually

difficult to witness, except by the earnest student
who is prepared to sacrifice both time and money.
The phenomena of Spiritualism are usually
placed in two categories : the mental or subjective,
and the physical or objective. Mental phenomena
pertain to the mind; they include clairvoyance,
prevision, psychometry, telepathy, etc. Physical
phenomena are ·perceived by the senses, material
or objective effects are produced: untouched ob-
jects are seen to move, luminous effects are seen
in the dark, rapping noises, voices or music are
heard, writing occurs on inaccessible papers, pho-
tographic plates are affected supernormally, ma-
terialized hands and faces are seen in semi-dark-
ness, wounds or diseased tissues are suddenly
healed, &c.
The majority of mediums produce only mental
phenomena, some produce both kinds. Probably
everyone has mediumistic faculties in a more or
less latent state; in perhaps twenty per cent they
are sufficiently active to be developed. The psychic
faculties of most mediums are limited to certain
types or groups of phenomena, and they may be
quite unable to produce others.
The experiments of the early Spiritualists, from
1848 onwards, carried little weight with the scien-

tific world. With a few notable exceptions, the
scientists scoffed and refused to examine either
the evidence or the alleged ·phenomena. The
twentieth century, however, has seen an increas-
ing number of European scientists who have de-
voted themselves to experimental work and writ-
ten classic books describing it. As a result of
their studies some of the best informed now
admit the reality of practically all the varied
mediumistic phenomena which, for nearly eighty
years, Spiritualists have been urging the world
to accept as true. It would seem, therefore, that
the day of triumph of these worthy pioneers is
not far off.
Psychic research has established a great variety
of extraordinary facts. The most momentous is
that man is really a spirit, clothed temporarily
in a material body. The spirit, which is, in fact,
his ego, mind or personality, has a permanent
etheric body or vehicle, interpenetrating the rna··
terial body, of which it is a replica, and which it
abandons at death. In its free state it is not en-
tirely cut off from the material world, but in cer-
tain conditions can communicate with those still
in earth life.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism :.
theo~y of the constitution of matter, the human
body, like all other material objects, consists far
more of en1pty spaces than of the electrons or
molecules of which it is composed, so that there
is ample room within it for an etheric body of
even greater "solidity." And the same thing may
be said of the entire material universe. For if it
be admitted that the rapidly vibrating, exceedingly
minute molecules or electrons which constitute
matter only occupy about one-billionth of the
space contained within its boundaries, there must
be ample space within our apparently solid world
for other worlds no less complex, which, because
of their particular atomic or vibratory constitu-
tion, are entirely beyond our limited sense per-
ceptions.
While enveloped by the material body a man's
ego or spirit is unable freely to exercise its innate
subliminal faculties, for in most of us our per-
ceptions of outward things are limited to those
communicated by our bodily sense organs. We
cannot see, for instance, without eyes, nor feel
without contact. Some few people, however, can
use more or less imperfectly their subliminal
faculties, for with bandaged eyes they can see
objects near at hand or hundreds of miles away;

they can obtain detailed knowledge of events hap-
pening at that moment in a far-off place, or dis-
cern accurately past and future events. While
the spirit is in close association with the n1aterial
body these transcendental or spiritual perceptions
are supernormal and imperfect, but, ultimately,
when freed from the body, they are norn1al and
perfect. Only those known as "sensitives'' or "me-
diums" can exercise these supernormal faculties.
Hypnotism and the Subconscio·us Mind
A great deal of \vhat we know about the spirit
or mind and its supernormal faculties we have
learned through hypnotism, which, in its elucida-
tion of supernormal mental phenomena, has been
a veritable master-key. Although nearly every
one is n1ore or less familiar \Vith the phenomenon
of hypnotism, and many are able without practice
to produce the condition in others, \Vhat actually
happens when the hypnotic state is induced is a
mystery. Hypnosis resembles ordinary sleep, but
instead of the waking, conscious mind retiring and
giving place to a topsy-turvy dream mind, it does
so in favour of what seems to be an alert intelli-
gent, sort of twin-brother of the conscious mind.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism
This secondary mind or personality which thus
emerges in hypnotism is generally described as
the subconscious or subliminal mind, because
normally it is submerged and not apparent. It
seems to be closely identified with the spirit, for
in many subjects its perceptions are independent
of the bodily sense organs. Thus some hypnotic
subjects can taste or smell what another at a dis-
tance tastes or smells, read correctly his unuttered
thoughts, or feel pain when the hypnotist is hurt.
Some can also perceive clairvoyantly scenes at a
distance, and read closed books, etc.
The fact that, in its activities, the subconscious
n1ind or spirit is independent of space and of the
bodily sense organs-as when it perceives things
happening hundreds of miles away-indicates
pretty clearly that its existence is not dependent
on that of the material body, the dissoluion of
\vhich, therefore, being something external to it,
cannot injuriously affect it. Evidential messages
fron1 those who have passed over assert that the
freeing of the spirit from the bonds of the flesh
is in every way advantageous, for its perceptions
are then keener and life in every way more \vorth
''"hile. In the case of the aged and those to \vhon1
rnis fortune or bodily infirrnities n1akes life a bur-

den, the loss of the body must evidently be one
of the greatest boons.
The fact that our mental organism is in dupli-
cate is not apparent to everyone, yet in each of
us there is a distinct conscious mind (our familiar
self or personality) and a subconscious mind (our
unfamiliar spirit self). That this is true may be
demonstrated in various ways, and particularly by
hypnotism. Many of us can awake at a certain
unusual time if we decide to do so before falling
asleep. What is it that rouses our slumbering
mind into activity? It is our hidden subconscious
mind, which although usually in the background
is, nevertheless, always alert and ready to do its
part. In the case of a sleep-walker the subcon-
scious mind is in complete control, the conscious
mind being in the background, submerged in deep
slumber. The sleep-walker does not use his ordi-
nary sense organs, for although it may be pitch
dark and his eyes may be closed, yet he moves
about safely without collision or stumble, and
has, on occasion, even been known to sit down
and write an essay on a difficult subject of which
he knows nothing when awake. He is clairvoyant,
i.e., his subconscious mind, or spirit, which con-

trois his movements, perceives independently of
the bodily sense organs.
One of the most remarkable facts revealed
by hypnotism is that nothing that we have
ever experienced, however trifling, is forgot-
ten ; though perhaps inaccessible to our con-
scious mind, it is recorded indelibly in the sub-
conscious. If we tell a suitable subject in hyp-
nosis that he is again, say, five years of age,
he will remember contemporaneous incidents
long forgotten by his conscious memory. If
lines of poetry are read to a hypnotised subject
he will remember nothing when awake, but
when again hypnotised, perhaps long after-
wards, he will remember them perfectly, for
they have been permanently recorded in his
subconscious mind, which again comes to the
front during hypnosis.
When we pass over, we take all our mem-
ories with us, and as they are open for others
to see, they may greatly influence our state of
happiness. If we have memories of cruelty,
injustice or selfishness we are filled with re-
gret, for it is then too late to make amends,
and our condition and progress are prejudiced.

subconscious mind is its readiness to accept
and act upon suggestion. If a suitable subject
is told in hypnosis that it is bitterly cold, he
will shiver and button up his coat; if told that
it is oppressively hot he will feel hot and per-
spire. If told that there is a bird in the room
which he must replace in its cage, he will chase
it and put it in the imaginary cage. If the
hypnotist gives him a pencil and paper and
desires mentally that he shall write something,
say, the words of the National Anthem, he will
do so. If he tells him he will write them an
hour after awakening he will do so; the writ-
ing will be done apparently automatically, for
a minute or two later he will have no conscious
memory of having written them. It should be
observed that not all subjects are equally
amenable to suggestion, and not all exhibit the
supernormal faculties outlined in the forego-
.
tng.
The subconscious mind has very far-reach-
ing powers of control over the bodily organ-
ism. If a suitable subject is told, in hypnosis,
that his heart will beat faster or slower it will
do so forthwith. Even the bodily temperature
may be raised or lowered by suggestion. Dr.
Burot, for instance, told a patient that his hand

would become cold, and its temperature there-
upon fell ten degrees. The subconscious mind
is capable of producing subtle changes in the
tissues; thus when a hypnotised subject is told
that the cold iron with which he is touched is
red-hot and will burn him, a blister will form
in accordance with the suggestion. And simi-
larly when a patient is told in hypnosis that his
ailment, whatever it be, is getting better and
will soon be well, his return to health will in
most cases be greatly expedited. If, when
operated upon surgically during hypnosis, a
patient is told that he will feel no pain at any
time and that the wound will heal quickly, he
will, in fact, feel no pain and the healing process
will be hastened in accordance with the sug-
gestion.
The subconscious mind is also accessible to
suggestion in the normal state, but in most
people the suggestion, to be effective, must be
made repeatedly. The fact that diseases may
be cured by repeatedly telling the patient, or
by the patient repeatedly telling himself, that
he is getting better and will soon be well, has
long been recognised, and the late l\1. Coue did
good service in popularising it.

. . The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism ..
The subconscious mind of a medium is much
more accessible to suggestion than that of ordi-
nary people. In the normal state it may be in-
fluenced telepathically by the thoughts and
feelings of others, and, in the trance state,
which is equivalent to self-induced hypnotism,
it may be still more readily influenced by ex-
ternal minds. Just as a hypnotised subject
will accept a mental suggestion or impression
from his hypnotiser to do, say, or write some-
thing, so will an entranced medium accept
similar suggestions from any external spirit
which happens to get into rapport.
It is by impressing telepathically the sub-
conscious mind of a medium that spirits are
able to communicate with friends in earth life.
And the ability to do so is not confined to the
spirits of those passed over, for those still in
earth life can communicate in the same way.
A medium while in the normal state may be
impressed to give a message either by speech
or automatic writing. Or he may be entranced,
so that his conscious mind disappears (more
or less completely), in which case an external
spirit may control all his thoughts and may
cause him to speak, write, or do whatever it
desires.

• • The Fundaonental Facts of Spiritualism :.
There are thus two classes of mediums for
spirit communications: those who remain in
the normal state, and those who are entranced.
The first are usually clairvoyant; they see and
describe the spirits who wish to communicate,
and they may hear them speak clairaudiently;
or they may be impressed telepathically with
the thoughts the spirits wish to convey, or
their hand may be controlled to write them
automatically. A good clairvoyant medium
will describe not only a spirit's appearance
as it was in earth life, but his character and the
circumstances of his death. Some are able to
give the name of the spirit friend, but usually
there is a difficulty with names, for a name is
not a thought that can be easily impressed
telepathically.
Automatic Writing
Automatic writing is one of the principal
means of spirit communication. The automatic
writer is usually in the normal state, but as
his hand is controlled by his subconscious
mind, he himself is not conscious of any mental
or muscular effort. His subconscious mind
may act independently, on its own, but usually

it is controlled or influenced more or less thor-
oughly by impressions from external spirit
tninds acting upon it telepathically. A well-
developed automatic writer will write correct-
ly whatever an external spirit may desire
(though, owing to inherent difficulties in con-
trol, there is always a risk of sophistication).
With imperfect mediumship there may be in-
fluences from the medium's own mind and
from interfering spirits who may get en rap-
port simultaneously and thus confuse the writ-
ing. A good automatic writer can write just as
well with his eyes closed; he need pay no at-
tention to the writing, and may even read a
book while it is in progress.
The automatic writer may use a pencil in the
ordinary way; sometimes, however, a planchette
is used, but with little advantage. Some mediums
find that they can better express their subcon-
scious impressions by the ouija board. This is
merely a small travelling pointer, usually a con-
verted planchette, which moves from letter to let-
ter of the alphabet, set out on a board or on a
strip of cardboard laid on the table. The spelling
out of a message in this way is often speedier
than automatic writing, for the pointer may move

with great rapidity. Sometimes two sitters place
their hands simultaneously on the travelling
pointer, and find it advantageous as regards the
clearness of the messages.
Spirit Communications
Spirit communications through an entranced
medium are often more satisfactory and evidential
than those obtained by other methods, for the
medium's own personality is more thoroughly ex..
eluded. The spirit controlling an entranced me-
dium is usually one of his own personal guides,
who may act as spokesman for a spirit friend.
When the spirit friend himself controls the me-
dium, the tone of the voice and manner of de-
livery may closely resemble those of the friend.
If controlled by the spirit of a Frenchman, Italian
or Greek, the medium will speak in these lan-
guages. If controlled by an erudite spirit he
will speak in a learned way, and vice versa.. The
famous trance medium, Cora L. V. Richmond,
when only fifteen years of age, discoursed under
trance control on any subject suggested a minute
before by the audience. On the subject, for in-
stance, of "The Influence of Aryan Philosophy
upon the Philosophy of Modern Times,'' she gave

an eloquent lecture, logical and replete with eru-
dition not possessed by savants among the audi-
ence.
Some trance mediums devote themselves to
helping people to communicate with their de-
parted friends, and many have been the means
of bringing untold happiness to mourners who
despairingly believed that their beloved one were
lost to them for ever.
Communications from spirit friends, whatever
the method employed, vary much in evidential
value, i.e., the content of the messages may, or
may not, be sufficient to prove conclusively that
it is our friend who speaks. The spirit world
surrounds us on all sides, and spirits of all kinds
are ever ready to get into touch if facilities are
offered, consequently, it is not always the friend
we desire who comes. Often strangers come and
talk, and some, lacking in moral rectitude, may
pretend to be old friends, either with a view to
receiving attention or, by way of a joke, to mis-
lead and confound. With good experienced me-
diums such difficulties are rare, but with unde-
veloped, inexperienced mediums confusion and
uncertainty are inevitable.

.. The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism .·.
To communicate with spirit friends is usually
a difficult and uncertain matter. It may becon1e
easy, however, if one devotes time and patience
to the endeavour, and keeps in close touch with
a friendly medium, or, better still, if one develops
mediumship oneself. Spirits who purport to be
our friends may at first have great difficulty in
proving their identity, because communications
between the two worlds, even when both parties
desire it, is no simple matter. It might be likened
to using a defective, long-distance telephone,
through which the tone of the voice is unrecog-
nisable and the words feeble and confused owing
to discontinuities and the jamming effect of other
speakers. Later when, by practice, experience is
acquired, difficulties disappear.
When trying to get into touch with a spirit
friend through a medium much depends on
whether the mentalities or psychic effluences of
sitter and medium harmonise. While with one
sitter a ·medium's psychic faculties may be at
their best, with another they may be almost in-
operative. And similarly, at a mediumistic seance
where there are several sitters, success depends
greatly on the mental states of the various sitters,
for the presence of even one who is unsympa-

thetic or antagonistic may be sufficient, with sen-
sitive mediums, to prevent all phenomena. For
this reason seances with promiscuous· sitters
should be avoided as far as practicable.
The phenomenon of trance control has been
much studied by savants, and, as a result, many
eminent, learned men, who for years were con-
firmed sceptics, have been converted to the belief
that our friends who have "died'' still live, and,
under certain conditions, can communicate with
us through suitable mediums. In many cases the
proof is so cogent and clear that no reasonable
person can doubt it. Perhaps the most decisiye
proof is the fact that an entranced medium can
carry on a conversation with a foreign sitter in
his own language, which may be one quite un-
known to the medium. The only reasonable ex-
planation of this phenomenon is that it is the
sitter's spirit friend who speaks through the en-
tranced medium, using the language with which
it was familiar in earth life. If more proof be
needed for the reality of spirit intercourse, there
is available a vast accumulation of records of
evidential communications, which forms a mass
of evidence that is quite overwhelming.

• • The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism •
Telepathy
Telepathy is the faculty by which people can
read the unuttered thoughts or feelings in the
minds of others. It is a supernormal one, for in
the majority of people it is never in evidence. In
a few it is rudimentary; in mediums it is strongly
developed, for in them, as just seen, the sub-
conscious mind is accessible to telepathic impres-
sions from spirits incarnate and discarnate. Many
carefully planned experiments have been made to
test whether or not thoughts can be conveyed be-
tween individuals, through space, telepathically;
and the reality of the factulty has been proved
repeatedly to the satisfaction of many well-known
scientific men. With good mediums, between
whom there is a bond of sympathy, distance ap-
pears to be of no account. The phenomenon,
although recognised and accepted, is still inex-
plicable, and how thoughts are trans£erred is a
profound mystery. The fact that their transfer-
ence is arbitrary and uncertain indicates the ex-
istence of psychical influences not under control
of the experimenters.
Telepathy between the minds of the medium
and sitter is often urged by sceptics as an explan-
ation of all spirit communications. But this is

not consistent with our knowledge of telepathy
as obtained experimentally, which shows that, be-
tween those still in earth life, it is feeble and
uncertain, and something quite different from the
telepathic messages received by a medium from
an external spirit. The latter are often prompt
and precise, and they may contain abundant and
unexpected details of long-forgotten incidents and
show knowledge of things unknown either to the
medium or sitter. Then, again, telepathy cannot
explain how a medium may speak to a sitter or
write messages in an unknown foreign language.
Clairvoyance
Clairvoyance is the faculty by which a medium
is able to perceive or gain intimate knowledge of
things, past, present, or future, independently of
the ordinary senses.* It varies greatly both in
power and character. While in some mediums it
is only rudimentary, in others there seems to be
scarcely any limit to its possibilities. In all cases
it is inconstant and evanescent. If there is an

embracing terms,-psycho-cognition, cryptesthesia, or
metagnomy.

effort made to perceive, as when a test is de-
manded, there may be no success, but later, when
mental tranquility prevails, the faculty may op-
erate freely.
Some well-developed clairvoyants can read
closed books, or letters enclosed in opaque envel-
opes, do fine needle-work in the dark, or see the
whereabouts of lost property and describe the cir-
cumstances of its loss. Some are able to diagnose
diseases, and describe accurately the nature of
internal disorders beyond the range of ordinary
medical knowledge. And some can do this just
as well in the case of a far-off patient whom they
have never seen. Dr. Eugene Osty, Director of
the International Metapsychic Institute, Paris, has
made a special study of the clairvoyant faculty
(as applied to human personalities), which he
terms "Metagnomy," and has recorded a large
number of remarkable instances in his book, "Su-
pernormal Faculties in Man'' (English translation
by Mr. Stanley D·e Brath, Land., 1923).
One of the most remarkable clairvoyant medi-
ums at the present time is M. Ludwig Kahn. His
clairvoyant faculty consists principally in reading
unseen writings, and a good account of it will be
found in the Revue Metapsychtque, No. 2, for

1925, and in the Journal of the American Society
for Psychical Research for ·October, 1925. His
usual procedure is to ask each of the sitters, per-
haps from four to six in number, to write some-
thing on a sheet of paper. They do this while he
is in another room, and each folds his paper in
eight, so that they are all alike. Kahn then enters
the room and asks one of the sitters to collect the
papers, mix them and redistribute them. He
then passes from one sitter to another and tells
each correctly what is written on the paper he
holds in his hand, and also says which particular
sitter wrote it. It should be observed that telep-
athy from the minds of the sitters is excluded as
an explanation, because no sitter knows what
paper is being read until it is opened.
The faculty of traveiling clairvoyance is spe-
cially interesting, for it seems to annihilate space.
At the request of a sitter the medium, who is
usually entranced, will, in effect, proceed to find
someone, or go to some specified place, describe
his supposed journey, how he has now arrived,
perhaps in a room in a strange house, which, with
its occupants and their doings, he will describe
with sufficient detail to permit of subsequent veri-
fication. He may be asked to go and find what a

distant friend is doing; with some mediums the
name of the friend alone suffices, but others re-
quire some article belonging to him, an influence
from which enables him to establish rapport and
describe his present doings and surroundings.
Crystal Visions
Many clairvoyant mediums see at odd times all
kinds of visions, which may obtrude themselves
without purpose on their notice. Some evoke
them best by gazing at an object having a smooth
or polished surface, which seems to calm the
mind or produce a suitable condition of nascent
trance. A small sphere of glass, known as a
"crystal,'' has been used for ages as a means of
inducing visions.
The pictures seen in the crystal are like those
observed on the focussing screen of a camera,
i.e., they are living pictures, and are as diverse as
those seen casually every day. They often seem
to be quite purposeless, and remain unverified as
representing actualities. Often, however, they
are reproductions of veritable contemporaneous
happenings, or of things seen in the past or
future, perhaps the next day or only a few min-
utes later. By means of the crystal some medi-

urns can see events in the past and future of a
sitter. The latter usually holds the crystal for a
few minutes, when it becomes affected by his
aura or influence, so that when the mediutn takes
it, it has the quality of a psychometric specimen.
Psychometry
Psychometry. is the peculiar clairvoyant faculty
by which certain mediums, while in the normal
state, can perceive incidents connected with any
object to which they may direct their attention.
If given, say, a piece of wood or stone brought
from some place of historical or other interest, a
good psychometrist will describe the place in
detail, and various incidents in its history. Simi-
larly, on merely holding a person's hand, he will
describe his character, state of health, and vari-
ous incidents in his life, past, present and future.
And he will do the same for a distant friend, if
given a lock of his hair or merely something he
has written or handled. This presentation of an
article to a medium is a common method of assist-
ing him to get into touch with a friend who has
passed over, the lock of hair, or whatever it is,
serving as a sort of connecting link.
Lost property has been traced and many crimes
unravelled by the help of a good psychometrist.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism
The spirit people rarely care to assist in hunting
down criminals, for they are not usually in sym-
pathy with our notions of retributive justice, but
guidance from the beyond is not essential to a
clairvoyant medium when unfolding the past,
present or future.
Precognition
The faculty of precognition is one possessed by
many mediums. Its reality can easily be tested
for almost any good clairvoyant medium will
describe future events in a sitter's life, and even
in that of a friend who is not present. It should
be observed, however, that, mixed up with accur-
ate statements, there is often much which is er-
roneous. Many accurate predictions of important
events have been published.
The Great War was predicted on June 19th
by a Greek girl, Sophie, aged 18, during hypnosis
induced by Dr. Antoniou of Athens. The doctor
wrote down her statements and mentioned them
during June and July to eighteen well-known citi-
zens of Athens. Later, on realising their impor-
tance, he published them in the Athens' news-
paper, "To Asty," for Aug. 24th to 27th. The
following are some of the things said by Sophie,
tn reply to questions.

Teleplasm and Physical Mediumship
It is not known exactly in what respect the
organism of a medium differs from that of ordin-
ary people, but it has been ascertained that the
production of objective phenomena depends on
their ability to emit a mysterious substance vari-
ously termed teleplasm, ectoplasm, psychoplasm
or ideoplasm.
The fact that teleplasm is essential to the pro-
duction of physical phenomena has long been

known to spiritualists, for it was described in
spirit communications as long ago as 1867 (see
Kardec's Book of A!ediums, p 91) and it has
often been seen from that time to the present day.
Recent experiments by eminent European scien-
tists, workin.g with exceptionally gifted mediums,
have established its reality beyond dispute, for it
has been observed at close quarters, handled and
photographed by flashlight ; and several scientific
monographs have been written describing it in
detail, with many photographs showing its vari-
ous modes of manifestation, and the human-like
forms it may assume.
Teleplasm may exude in a visible, pasty state
from any part or any aperture of a medium's
body, or it may be emitted as a sort of vapour,
visible or invisible. It is a substance essentially
different from all other forms of matter. It is
not inert or stable, but can change its condition
almost instantly from an invisible, vaporous
state, to a visible pasty, or solid one, and vice
versa.. It is usually white or grey in colour. It
can assume luminosity, and become warm or cold,
soft or hard. It is ponderable and can convey
force and energy. It may take the form of long
arm-like protrusions or extensions from the me-

dium's body, visible or invisible, which can seize
and manipulate objects at a distance. Although
it n1ay operate at a distance of many feet and
appear to be detached and independent, there
seems always to be a connection with the medium.
It is imbued with life, for it can move and change
its shape, and mould itself into the semblance of
any part, or the whole, of a living body, anatomi-
cally perfect. It has independent vitality which
enables it to react to some intelligent formative
power either inherent in it, or communicated by
some external intelligence. This intelligence may
be that of the medium himself, but usually it ap-
pears to be that of an external spirit which is in
control of the medium's subconscious mind while
in the trance state.
Teleplasm is an essential agent in all medium-
istic phenomena in which matter is affected, as,
say, the telekinetic movement of an untouched
object. Spirit, mind, or will power being without
material attributes, cannot convey (in the ordinary
way) the mechanical forces necessary to produce
effects on ordinary lifeless matter. Living matter
is exceptional in that it can be acted upon directly
by mind. The human hand, for instance, though

of the mind, acting through the brain and nerves.
If we will our hand to write, it does so, but why
or how the thought is converted into action is a
profound mystery. Teleplasmic extensions from
a medium's body are under the control of the
medium's subconscious mind in a similar way.
And just as a medium's hand may be controlled
to write a letter or lift an object either by his
own will power or by that of an external spirit
acting through his subconscious n1ind, so may a
teleplasmic arm-like protrusion (which can as-
sume all the physical and anaton1ical features of
any part, or the whole, of a human body) be con-
trolled to produce sitnilar effects.
Teleplasm proceeding from the body of a me-
dium, has been observed to elevate an untouched
object like a table, and with such force that the
full weight of a man could not depress it. This
class of phenomenon usually occurs only in din1
red light, but the teleplasm has been seen and
photographed by flash light, and has the appear-
ance of a white column or strut supporting the
table frotn below. Dr. Crawford's extensive series
of experiments and those of other researchers
have established these facts, and Crawford's book,

Psychic Structures (Lond.) includes photograhic
reproductions of the teleplasmic struts.
It should be observed that no rules or explana-
tions can be given that are generally applicable to
all psychic phenomena, for the character of the
latter varies in every possible way. Thus, while
teleplasm would seem to be essential to the pro-
duction of telekinetic phenomena (the movement
of untouched objects) in the seance room, there
are other phenomena of a similar character in
which it would seem not to be necessary, for ex-
ample, the phenomenon of apports, in which ob-
jects may be transported from a great distance.
Materialisation
The phenomenon of materialisation, as usually
understood, is the temporary creation of a living
human body, in whole or in part, which is vital-
ised by a spirit. Though common in the past,
they are now rare, and are usually limited to
hands (which may be felt) or faces. The faces
may be seen in the darkened seance room by
means of a prepared phosphorescent slate, or by a
psychic light provided by the spirit, or they may
be self-luminous. Sometimes they are recognised
as friends of the sitters, and they may say a few
words.

The Fundantental Facts of Spiritualism : .
. .
Formerly, full-size, completely materialised
forms were not uncommon, and they were so ana-
tomically perfect that they could walk about the
seance room and talk, and do anything that an
ordinary individual can do. In California, simi-
lar phenomena can be observed today.
In 1874 Sir William Crookes, F.R.S. made ex-
tensive experiments with the medium, Florence
Cook, then aged 17 years, who stayed with him
in his own house in London ; and in his book,
Phen01nena of Spiritualism, he describes with
great detail the human characteristics of the spirit,
Katie King, who frequently materialised, and,
during her stay of an hour or so, behaved like
one of the family. The literature of Spiritualism
abounds with authentic records of wonderful
n1aterialisations which, in view of their present
rarity, are well worth studying.
The materialised form is built up from tele-
plasm withdrawn from the mediutn, who shrinks
in bulk and weight proportionately to the amount
yielded ; in many cases, however, the sitters un-
consciously contribute. Dr. Crawford's medium,
Miss Goligher, sat on a weighing machine and he
records that on one occasion her weight was re-
duced by 54~ pounds by the withdrawal of tele-

plasm. The weight of the materialised form
varies, and it may be increased or diminished at
the request of the sitters; finally, of course, it be-
comes zero when dematerialisation occurs and
the teleplasm returns to the medium.
Materialisations only occur in the dark, or in
a dimly lighted room, and a small curtained off
space termed a "cabinet" is provided, in which
the medium n1ay sit in the dark and be protected
from the gaze of the sitters, which has an ob-
structive effect on all objective phenomena. The
spirit usually builds up in the cabinet close to the
medium (from teleplasm which is probably
emitted in a vaporous state and then condensed)
and then walks out into the seance room. Some-
times they build up in full view, slowly or sud-
denly; and again dematerialise in full view, slowly
or suddenly, usually by apparently sinking into
the floor.
The formation in the seance room of paraffin-
wax moulds of materialised hands or feet is a
phenomenon which has frequently been observed
since 1876. If we dip a hand or foot in melted
paraffin and withdraw it, it will be clothed with a
thin waxen glove. If now the hand or foot could
be withdrawn from the glove, the latter would

form a very perfect mould, which, if filled with
liquid plaster of paris, would result-when the
plaster solidified and the paraffin was melted off-
in an exact replica in plaster of the hand or foot,
on which the fine texture of the skin would be
faithfully reproduced. A human hand or foot
cannot, however, be withdrawn from an adhesive
wax mould through the small wrist portion with-
out distorting or rupturing it (and more particu-
larly if the fingers are crossed and the wax glove
is thin), but that of a materialised spirit can be,
by simply dematerialising it in place. Moulds so
obtained form a permanent and convincing proof
of the reality of the materialised spirit, for no
human being can produce the same thing. Many
illustrations of these moulds will be found in the
Revue Metapsychique (Paris) No. 5 for 1922,
and in Psychic Science (London) No.2 for 1922.
Spirit Raps
The spirit rap is one of the commonest physical
phenomena, not all mediums obtain them, how-
ever, for they require physical mediumship.
Though loudest in the dark, they are often heard
in good light. Dr. Crawford ascertained that the

raps he observed required the withdrawal of tele-
plasm from the medium, more or less according
as the raps were loud or soft. Spirits do not only
make rapping noises, for they can reproduce with
marvellous similitude sounds of every conceivable
kind. They can imitate any musical instrument,
and such sounds as the sawing of wood, hammer-
ing of nails, the wind and rain, trickling and
splashing of water, breaking of crockery, an aero-
plane, locomotive, or prancing horse have all been
faithfully reproduced.
The word "rap'' conveys a wrong idea of the
sound, for it cannot be truthfully imitated. It is
a muffled, percussive sound, of almost infinitely
varied character, which usually seems to cotne
from \vithin the substance of an object. It varies
in intensity from the tiniest tick to deep thuds or
sledge-hammer blows. They usually occur in the
vicinity of the medium, but when the power is
strong they may come fron1 distant parts of the
room.
Raps are genera11y used as signals when it is
desired to communicate through the alphabet, for
when this is read through, a rap will be made
when the required letter is reached.

Table Movements and Levitation
Sometimes, instead of a rap, the table on which
the sitters place their hands is tilted when the
right letter is reached. When a small light table
is used there is little doubt that in most cases the
tilting is the result of impulses subconsciously
made by the medium, whose arms are controlled
in the same way as the hand of the automatic
\vriter is controlled. With strong physical me-
diums, however, the table movements may be quite
independent of the muscles of the medium or
sitters. In such cases the spirit operators seem.
actually to animate the table, so that it appears to
be alive. Although only just touched on the top,
it will walk about the room or climb upstairs. It
can join in the sitters' laughter, by little jerks,
thrills and spasmodic quivers. It can stamp its
feet with impatience or anger ; show doubt and
hesitation when answering a question, or quick
and ready affirmation. A good account of what
the table can do will be found in Sir Oliver
Lodge's Raymond (pp. 222, 223).
A common seance-room phenomenon is the lift-
ing and displacement of objects small and large.
Usually the object has to be touched by the medi-
um and sitters, but often no touch is needed, the

phenomenon being then termed "telekinetic."
Small tables are often lifted, but large, heavy
ones have also been lifted, and sometimes with
one or two men sitting on the top, and even a
grand piano has been lifted from the floor. The
medium himself has sometimes been lifted. The
celebrated D. D. Home was levitated repeatedly
and floated round the room over the heads of the
sitters. Sir William Crookes, F.R.S., frequently
observed this phenomenon, and in his Phenomena
of Spiritualtsm} p. 89, says :-"To reject the rec-
orded evidence on this subject is to reject all
human testimony whatever; for no fact in sacred
or profane history is supported by a stronger array
of proofs."
Cold Winds
At seances for physical phenomena cold winds
are often felt. Sir William ·Crookes, referring
to this in his Phenomena of Spiritualism (p. 86),
says:- '' I ·may say every kind of phenomenon
is generally preceded by a peculiar cold air, some-
times amounting to a decided wind. I have had
sheets of paper blown about by it, and a thermo-
meter lowered several degrees. On one occasion,
which I will subsequently give more in detail, I

but the cold wind has been so intense that I could
only compare it to that felt when the hand has
been within a few inches of frozen mercury.''
Mr. Harry Price used a registering thermo-
meter at a seance with the medium, Stella C., and
observed a reduction of temperature of 20.5 degs.
Fahr. (see his book Stella C., Lond., 1925).
Fire Tests
Spirits are able to deal with fire; to create or
extinguish it, deprive it of its power to burn, or
confer on combustible things immunity from its
effects. By virtue of this power the medium may
place his hands in flame, or grasp red-hot objects
without injury. D. D. Home often exhibited this
phenomenon. On many occasions he was seen
to stir the fire with his hands, lift a lump of red-
hot coal and carry it round the roon1. And he
could confer immunity from burning to others,
for when sitters were given the red-hot coal they
also held it without injury. On several occasions
Home placed his face and head among the red-hot
coals in the grate, and not a hair was singed.
1\Iany other mediums have exhibited itnmunity
from the effects of fire. In 1917 Mrs. Annie

Hunter lifted a red-hot log from the fire and
carried it round the room, and she handed it to
Mrs. De Crespigny who held it without injury.
The "Fire Ordeal'' is still practised by some bar-
barian peoples: a rough pavement of stones is
made red-hot by burning over it for many hours a
large wood fire, and afterwards a number of
natives walk with bare feet over the red-hot
stones. And there are authentic records of Euro-
peans having followed them without injury.
Apports
The phenomenon of apports is the conveyance
of material objects, large or small, into a room
the containing walls of which have no apertures
through which they can pass. It is a fairly com-
mon phenomenon, but usually occurs only in the
dark. With specially gifted mediums the variety
of the apports is amazing, living animals, birds,
birds' eggs, fish, reptiles, plants, flowers, fruits,
earth, snow, books, curios, etc., have all formed
apports at one seance or another. As the phe-
nomenon involves the passage of matter through
matter, we can only conceive it as being accomp-
lished by the dematerialisation of the article,
which, in its then attenuated or etheric state, is

introduced into the seance room and there ma-
terialised back into its former state. On arrival
the apports are sometimes very hot, which would
indicate that they had recently been subjected to
0
compression.
There have been many celebrated apport me-
diums, and the phenomenon is still occasionally
observed. The celebrated non-professional me-
dium, Mrs. Guppy (nee Nichol), excelled in ap-
port phenomena. The following quotation is from
a description of one of her seances given by
Alfred Russel Wallace, F.R.S., in his Miracles
and Modern Spiritu-a-lism, p. 162 :-
"The most remarkable feature of this lady's
mediumship is the production of flowers and fruits
in closed rooms. The first time this occurred was
at my own house, at a very early stage of her
development. All present were my own friends.
Miss Nichol had come early to tea, it being mid-
winter, and she had been with us in a very warms
gas-lighted room for hours before the flowers ap-
peared. The essential fact is that, upon a bare
table in a sn1all room, closed and dark (the ad-
joining room and passage being well lighted), a
quantity of flowers appeared, which were not there
when we put out the gas a few minutes before.

They consisted of anemones, tulips, chrysanthe-
mums, Chinese primroses, and several ferns. All
were absolutely fresh, as if just gathered from a
conservatory. They were covered with a fine,
cold dew. Not a petal was crumpled or broken
not the most delicate point or pinnule of the
ferns was out of place.-Similar phenomena have
occurred hundreds of times since in many houses
and under various conditions. Sometimes the
flowers have been in vast quantities, heaped upon
the table. Often flowers or fruits asked for are
brought. A friend of mine asked for a sun-
flower, and one six feet high fell upon the table,
having a large mass of earth about its roots."
Direct Voice
In the presence of a suitable medium, spirits
can talk in a voice which does not proceed from
the medium. This is known as the direct or in-
dependent voice. They may speak in the tones
of robust manhood or the thin treble of a child,
accents, whether Scotch, Irish or American, be-
ing truthfully rendered. With most mediums the
voice only occurs in perfect darkness. Spirit
friends usually find difficulty in speaking for the
first time, and consequently their voice may be

whispering and indistinct, as conversation pro-
ceeds it improves, and if the sittings are repeated
it may become recognisable. To assist weak
speakers a trumpet or megaphone is provided,
which magnifies the voice.
The spirits usually indicate their presence in
the room by moving the trumpet about and touch-
ing the sitters with it, its movements being seen
in the dark by coating it with luminous paint.
Sometimes luminous faces are faintly seen in the
dark, and floating spirit lights. At the present
time in England and America there are several
good direct-voice mediums, professional and non-
professional. If the conditions are good and there
are several sitters, all sorts of conversations with
spirit friends may be heard. Different spirits not
only speak with different voices and accents, and
in every language, but remarkable good singing
and whistling are often heard.
Apparently the modus operandi of the spirits
when communicating with the direct voice is to
materialise sufficiently to be able to speak. They
evidently create a larynx or its equivalent, from
teleplasm withdrawn from the medium or sitters,
just as they do at materialisation seances when
they sho\v themselves fully formed and talk to the
sitters.

l\1any tests have been made to prove that the
direct voice is not produced by the medium's
vocal organs. Often a sitter will hold his hand
tight!y on the medium's mouth. Sometimes his
lips are sealed with plaster, and sometimes he has
held water in his mouth, which is ejected after
the voices have been heard and the light is
switched on. Quite recently the question has
been definitely settled by an experiment with Mrs.
Crandon ("Margery", the wife of Dr. Crandon,
the famous Boston surgeon), whose long-con-
tinued, self-sacrificing efforts to assist in solving
the mysteries of her mediumship deserve the
highest praise. She held in her mouth the end of
a flexible tube connected with a vertical glass tube
half full of water. As she blew into the tube the
water rose, and while the voice spoke in the dark-
ness the water level was seen, by means of a
luminous float, not to vary. The flexible tube
\vas incon1pressible and had a glass mouthpiece
with three holes in it, so placed that one could be
covert-d with the tongue and the other two with
the Jips. If any hole was uncovered for a second,
by movement of the lips or tongue as required
for speech, the water level fell and thus indicated
the fact. Details of this apparatus are given in
the Jour1zal of the American SPR for Aug., 1926.

The Fundmnental Facts of Spiritualism
Direct Writing
In the presence of a suitable medium spirits can
write directly without the intervention of the
human hand. This is known as psychography or
direct spirit writing. Just now the phenomenon
is very rare, formerly it was often seen. The
method usually adopted was to lay a blank sheet
of paper on the table, all present held hands, the
light was extinguished, raps signalled the comple-
tion of the writing, and the light was then turned
up for inspection. The celerity with which such
writing was done is amazing, a rate of 100 words
per second being recorded, and elaborate draw-
ings were made as quickly. Sometimes a lumin-
ous hand has been seen to lift the pencil, write a
n1essage and then disappear.
The most convenient way of obtaining spirit
writing is by means of ordinary school slates.
tfo describe one of the many procedures: two
slates are laid on the table face to face, so that the
wooden frames only are in contact, and a tiny
fragment of slate pencil is put in the space between
them. The medi~m and sitters then place their
hands on the slates, \vriting is heard, and, on tak-
ing them apart, writing is found, perhaps only a

word or two, or a statement or message covering
both slates.
Sir William Crookes, F.R.S., speaking of direct
spirit writing, says in his Phenomena of Spirit-
ualism :-"I have had words and messages repeat-
edly written on privately marked paper, under the .
n1ost rigid test conditions, and have heard the
pencil moving over the paper in the dark. The
conditions-prearranged by myself-have been so
strict as to be equally convincing to my mind as
if I had seen the written characters formed.''
Vice-Admiral Moore observed some wonder-
ful direct writing through the unique mediumship
of the Misses Bangs of Chicago. He journeyed
specially from England to see them, and he rec-
ords his experiences in his book Glimpses of the
Ne.,rt State. Their method was to ask the sitter
to write privately a letter to a spirit friend asking
questions on any matter, and enclose it, together
with blank sheets for the spirit's reply, in a sealed
envelope. The letter was then deposited between
two hinged slates, which were laid on the table in
front of the sitter, who placed his hands on them.
The medium sat on the opposite side of the table
and did not touch the slates. There was bright
daylight throughout the seance. After a period

varying fro~ a few minutes to an hour or more,
raps signalled that the reply was written, the sit-
ter then opened the slates, took his letter saw that
the seals were unbroken, opened it and found one
or more of the blank sheets filled with writing in
ink. The caligraphy was not usually that of the
sitter's spirit friend; but the reply showed knowl-
edge, more or less thorough, of the subjects re-
ferred to, and in many cases the identity of the
spirit sender was established to the satisfaction
of the sitter.
Direct Portraiture
The Misses Bangs also obtained coloured
portraits of spirit friends of the sitters, openly,
tn bright daylight. The mode of procedure
was as follows :-A plain wood table was
placed lengthwise across the seance room win-
dow, which looked out on the street. The
Bangs sisters sat one at each end of the table,
..
and the sitter at the side, facing the window
and less than a yard away from it. Two simple
wooden frames on which thin paper-mounted
canvas was stretched, \vere placed face to face
with the paper surfaces in contact. These were
then held up together close to the window,

with their lower edges resting on the table;
each n1ediun1 gripped a side with one hand,
and thus held them erect and together. An
opaque blind was drawn down to the top of the
frames and a short curtain was hung on either
side, so that the window was darkened except
for the light which streamed through the trans-
lucent canvas.
In about fifteen minutes, more or less, tints
of different colour appeared on the canvas;
parts became opaque, then translucent again,
and vague outlines of faces appeared and dis-
appeared in different places, finally the picture
grew rapidly and was finished. The frames
were taken down and separated, and the pic-
ture was found to be on the paper surface of
the one next the sitter. Vice-Admiral Moore
obtained in this way a very good portrait of a
lady friend who had passed over, and presented
it to the London Spiritualist .Alliance of Lon-
don, where it is on view.
Psychic Photography
The phenomenon of spirit photography has
probably been more studied than any other,
and several books have been published dealing

with it alone, each reproducing son1e of the
many well vouched for examples of the phe-
nomenon. Like other psychic phenomena it
requires the presence of a suitable medium,
and at the present time these are rare. The
medium need have no knowledge of photog-
raphy, for all he need really do is to hold the
packet of plates or the loaded dark-slides for
a few minutes, or merely be presen~ in the
room when the photograph is taken.
In a successful psychic photograph the nega-
tive shows, in addition to the sitter, a plainly
recognisable likeness of a friend who has
passed over. This "extra", as it is termed, is
usually swathed in white substance, resembling
gossamer, cotton wool, or vapour, which by its
appearance suggests the presence of teleplasm;
occasionally, however, it is in everyday attire.
The majority of psychic photographs are ill-
defined and imperfect. Sometimes they in-
clude several well-defined but unrecognised
extras. Sometimes only cloudy white mark-
ings occur which may obliterate the sitter;
these are evidently of psychic origin, for their
presence is otherwise quite inexplicable.
In psychic photography it i~ not essential
that the plate should be exposed in a camera,

for on many occasions plates taken direct from
an unopened packet (after it has been handled
for a few minutes by the medium) and devel-
oped forthwith have borne the likeness of a
friend; or written messages, which may be in
a foreign language unknown to the medium
and sitters.
Many people on visiting a psychic photog-
rapher have obtained an undoubted likeness of
a spirit friend, fraud on the part of the photog-
rapher having been entirely precluded by sim-
ply taking care that they were unknown to him
and that he was not even aware of their in-
tended visit. An excellent instance of a recog·
nisable psychic photograph of a spirit friend,
is that of the late Dr. Geley, obtained by Mr.
Stanley De Erath on 24th July 1924, exactly
nine days after his death by accident. A re-
production of the photograph and an account
of the test conditions under which it was taken
will be found in Psychic Science, (Lond.) for
October, 1924.

or reads. There is an immense amount of lit-
erature in all languages on the subject, and the
truth of many of the accounts is so well
vouched for that no serious enquirer can doubt
it. The cause of hauntings is obscure. It is
probably due in most cases to troubled earth-
bound spirits who, finding little happiness in
spirit life and failing to progress, are fain to
return to the familiar scenes of earth life. Ap-
parently in most cases the cause inciting or
compelling them to return is that they are
filled with regrets or remorse for an ill-spent
life or some selfish act or crime they have
committed, and, through constantly brooding
over it, are attracted to the place of its com-
mtsston.
A ghost may be regarded as a spontaneous
materialization, which, like those of the seance
room, may be more or less immaterial and
translucent. When seen simultaneously by
several people who are not all mediums, it
is probably sufficiently materialised to affect
a photographic plate. Old houses are the most
often haunted, because some of the numerous
people who have lived in them are likely to
have led the kind of earth life which is followed
by a remorseful spirit life.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism : .
Haunting spirits may come and go for long
periods regardless of the presence or absence
of observers. Like the rnaterialised spirits of
the seance room, if they are interfered with,
they vanish. In the presence of a medium they
and their manifestations gain strength. In
many cases they have been interviewed by a
medium and have related the cause of their
trouble; and sometimes, by carrying out some
simple desire, the need for which they seem to
entertain as a sort of hallucination, their minds
have been set at rest and they have quickly
given up the haunting habit.
Poltergeists
Among our fellow creatures, civilised and
barbarian, there are many who delight in a
practical joke. With brutal unsympathetic
people the more mischief the greater the fun,
and when such people die they take their mis-
chievous propensities with them undiminished,
and may still indulge their delight in horse-
play by producing the manifestations known
as "poltergeist disturbances".
The German word, poltergeist, means literally
a boisterous ghost; it is an appropriate term

because the manifestations are often of a wild,
tnischievous and destructive character. They
take many forms, the commonest is the throw-
ing of stones or other objects within or around
a particular house, the breaking of windows
or crockery, distracting noises, the ringing of
bells, the derangement of household furniture;
more rarely the sprinkling of water, setting
fire to property, etc. They have occurred at
all periods of the world's history. The poor
past centuries witches were often made the vic-
tims, for, in the absence of any assignable cause
for the disturbance, any old woman or child who
seemed to be associated with it was blamed as the
originator and burned as a witch.
The literature of Spiritualism abounds with
well authenticated accounts of poltergeist phe-
nomena. They are extraordinarily numerous,
and, indeed, are probably of daily occurrence
somewhere in the world. The ignorant com-
monly attribute them to practical jokers, an
assumption which is strengthened by newspa-
per accounts, in which, after a few humorous
articles, it is usually jocosely announced that a
confession has been made by some irrespons-
ible young person supposed to be implicated.

Though the facts are plainly of a nature en-
tirely beyond the capabilities of any human
being, and may be attested by dozens of in-
telligent people, the bogus confession is always
gladly accepted by the ignorant public.
There are few psychical phenomena better
established than that of the poltergeist. These
and allied cases of haunting, have occurred so
often under the eyes of competent observers
and have been so well and continuously record-
ed in current literature that only the ignorant
and the credulous now accept the practical joker
as an explanation.
Poltergeist phenomena do not seem invari-
ably to require the actual presence of a medi-
um, although they are usually clearly depend-
ent on some one who is a medium and who is
usually resident in the house. They are much
more impressive than seance room phenomena,
because the effects produced are more pro-
digious and are not subject to the limitations
of the seance room, where little can be ac-
complished without a powerful medium, com-
parative darkness and suitable sitters. They
may continue day after day, for hours together,
in bright daylight, in the presence of crowds of
hostile spectators. In fact, just as the artificial

thunder and lightning of the laboratory are
feeble compared with those of nature, so are
the evoked phenomena of the seance room
feeble in comparison with those spontaneously
produced by the poltergeist. It is because of
their independence of conditions and their
spontaneous character that they are so impres-
sive; they indicate clearly the actual presence
of invisible spirit beings, possessing extraor-
dinary power over matter.
The Double
The belief that within our material body
there is an etheric counterpart or spirit body,
which leaves it at death and, in certain indi-
viduals, can leave it temporarily during life
and make itself visible to others at a distance,
is well supported by the frequently observed
appearance of the double, which may be defined
as a perfectly life-like apparition of an individual
who is at that moment in another place. Spon-
taneous examples of this phenomenon are very
abundant; the elaborate two-volume work, Phan-
tasms of the Living (by Gurney, Myers and Pod-
more), contains many well-authenticated cases,
and there are also many authentic cases of its

production experimentally. That it is an ob-
jective reality, and not the result of hallucina-
tion, is evident from the fact that it is often
seen simultaneously by several independent
observers, also by animals, and it has been
photographed. Though usually silent, it some-
times speaks.
The power to project at will the spirit body
or double is a rare faculty in mediums. By
the usual ewperimental method of procedure,
the experimenter, or agent, just before retiring
to rest at night, determines with a concentrated
effort of will to visit, in spirit, a friend, the per-
cipient, who is unaware of the experiment. Next
day or later, if the experiment has succeeded, the
friend tells him of how he has seen him during
the night. The power is very uncertain and
erratic. Success and failure come when least
expected. While on one occasion an experi-
menter may exercise the greatest mental effort
and fail, on another occasion, when only casu-
ally thinking of his friend, he may succeed.
The double often occurs when the agent is
dreaming of the percipient, and these cases
seem to prove that, with certain individuals,
the spirit can leave the body when asleep; and

sometimes the dream.er remembers his dream,
and is able to give a verifiable account of his
spirit's doings.
\\lith some people the desire to be in a fa-
miliar place may have the effect of projecting
their double or spirit body to that place, so that
it can be seen by anyone who happens to be
there. The ·phenomenon is fairly common. It
usually occurs when the agent is journeying
to the place, and is probably directing his
thoughts there in anticipation of his arrival.
The most favourable time for apparitions of
the living is at moments when the agent is
suffering mental stress of any kind. This con-
dition often occurs just before death, or during
illness, accident or fright, or with those who
are on the point of drowning. In most cases
the actual spirit or double is not seen, but
merely impresses the percipient clairvoyantly
or clairaudiently with a knowledge of his con-
dition, more or less precise and detailed.
Spiritual Healing
The most beneficial phase of mediumship for
mankind is undoubtedly healing mediumship.
Healing mediums have always been numerous,
and all the most famous have been of the male

sex. They vary greatly in their characteristics
and methods ; some know little or nothing of
Spiritualism or mediumship, but are ~erely
aware of the fact that their touch has a cura-
tive effect on the pains and diseases of others,
and in many cases they only discover it acci-
dentally. In the other extreme the healer is
a well-developed trance medium, whose con-
trolling spirit usually claims to have been a
doctor or medicine-man in earth life, and has
acquired in spirit life knowledge which enables
him so to affect the human: organism that
diseased tissues are speedily renovated. The
cures effected may appear to be instantaneous,
or follow as a result of progressive treatment.
In many healers a curative influence seems
to be inherent in their organism, so that they
are independent of external spirit aid. They
possess a kind of vital energy or "magnetism",
which, passing from them to the sufferer, vital-
ises his decadent tissues. Probably the pa-
tient's own natural recuperative powers are
sufficiently reinforced and quickened by sug-
gestion, and by the curative influence of the
healer, to produce rapidly the desired remedial
effect.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism : •
..
Those sceptical of the healing power of medi-
ums and of spiritual healing generally, while ad-
mitting wonderful cures, attribute all to the power
of suggestion. \Ve have seen that the sub-
conscious mind has inherent powers of control
over the physical organism, and that it may be
readily influenced to exert them under sugges-
tion, given either in the' hypnotic or normal
state. But while in many cases suggestion
may play an important part, in others it does
not, for infants too young or too ill to appreci-
ate their position have been the subject of
miraculous cures.
There have been many notable healing medi-
ums, and the literature of Spiritualism abounds
with records of their numerous cures. The
Bible accounts of the miraculous cures effected
by Christ and his disciples have been paralleled
over and over again, and identical phenomena
have never ceased to occur.
Different healers have different methods of
treatment. While one will merely hold the hand
of the sufferer, another will place his hand
on the seat of the disease or breathe on it, and
yet another, in an apparently similar case, will
make passes or employ manipulations of vari-

ous kinds. And while one healer will be silent
and entirely matter-of-fact, another will pray
aloud and exhort the sufferer to have faith and
he will be cured.
Miraculous cures of apparently spontaneous
character have long been associated with cer-
tain places, usually regarded as sacred. Those,
for example which occur at Lourdes, and at
the tomb of the Abbe Paris; at Treves in Ger-
many and Holywell in Wales. In many cases
the cures are truly miraculous, for they are
instantaneous and involve the renewal of parts
that have disappeared entirely through disease.
A remarkable instance of the latter type is
the cure of Pierre de Rudder, of Jabbeke, Bel-
gium, an account of which \vill be found in
Preuves Medicates du Miracle, by Dr. Le Bee
(Paris, 1918). De Rudder was a woodcutter,
and in Feb., 1867, when 44 years of age, a tree
fell on his left leg, breaking both tibia and
fibula. The flesh of the calf ulcerated and be-
came an open, gangrenous wound, from which
detached fragments of bone were taken. He
refused amputation and for eight years the
wound remained open and purulent. The ends
of the bones were more than an inch apart.

They could be forced out of the wound, and
were seen to be darkened and decayed ; and
the foot could be turned round so that the heel
was in front and the toes behind.
On the 7th April, 1875, de Rudder was lifted
into the train for Oostakker. Thence he went
to the Grotto by omnibus, the conductor of
which complained of the defilement of the
floor by the blood and pus which flowed from
the diseased leg. On arrival at the Grotto he
sat exhausted on a bench. Suddenly he felt a
peculiar agitation, and at that moment his leg
was healed, for he immediately got up and
walked briskly, without his crutches and 'Without
even a limp. On examining the leg the bones were
found to be solidly united and the wound was
closed and cicatrized.
1.,he case is well authenticated because de
Rudder was an interesting subject to numerous
doctors and surgeons who frequently examined
him. The wound was bandaged on the three
days immediately preceding the cure, and sub-
sequent examination showed that the cure was
complete and perfect. De Rudder resumed his
occupation and died 23 years later at the age of
75. Subsequently his body was exhumed and

the bones of the leg were found to be strongly
united, though misshapen at the junction. But
there was not the slightest shortening, portions
of new bone of proper length having been in-
troduced at the time of the cure. The bones
are well illustrated in Dr. Bee's book.
The origin of mediumistic phenomena is
often questioned. Uninformed spiritualists be-
lieve that all are due to the intervention of
discarnate spirits; this, however, is by no means
the case, for, as noticed elsewhere, the undying
spirit which is in each of us possesses faculties
similar to those possessed by free discarnate
spirits, and, in the case of mediums, can produce
supernormal phenomena. unaided. This is evi-
dently true in the case of mental phenomena such
as telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition, but it
is not so evident in the case of objective phe-
nomena. Thus, while it is conceivable that a
tnedium n1ay be able to externalise a psychic
force that will cause movement of an external
object, it is inconceivable that his spirit unaided
can produce, for example, such a condition in the
human body as will make it impervious to the
effects of fire, or cause solid objects actually to de-
materialise or disappear, and vice versa.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism : .

The supernormal phenomena of Spiritualism,
when properly studied, prove that we survive
the loss of the body at death, and that our
personality and habits of thought are unaltered
by the change of circumstance. They also
prove that communication is possible between
those who have passed over and those still in
earth life. Our spirit friends tell us that they
are still very much alive; that their condition
is not a shado\vy, ghost-like one, but, on the
contrary, that they have a perfectly tangible
body, that their perceptions are keener and
that everything they were familiar with in
earth life has a counterpart in the spirit world,
even more tangible and real. They also unite
in asserting that their new world is more
beautiful, that their condition is one of greater
happiness and that, if given the choice, nothing
would induce them to return to earth life. This
condition of greater happiness, however, is not
immediately attainable by all. Those who in
earth life have been cruel, selfish and uncharit-
able are far from happy, for, not only are their
misdeeds and moral character apparent to all,
but they are segregated from happier spirits,
and can only improve their condition by a

Appendix
The following rules for forming spirit circles
are given for the assistance of those who de-
sire to enter into the investigation in their own
home. They were compiled by J. J. Morse,
late editor of The Two Worlds, and embody the
results of his experiences extending over nearly
forty years.
It is quite an erroneous idea that the phe-
nomena of Spiritualism can only be obtained
in the presence of professional mediums. The
most wonderful results have been obtained, in
thousands of instances, by private families un-
aided by any previously developed media, pri-
vate or professional.
How to Form Spirit Circles
The spirit circle is a gathering of persons
who desire to establish relations with the world
of spirits, and receive communications there-
from. As such communication is a matter of
fact- proved by oft-repeated experiment- it
follows that the observance of those conditions
which experience suggests will be the surest
way of obtaining the desired results.
Among the conditions required to be ob-
served, the follo\ving should receive careful
consideration:-

:. The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism :.
The Place
This should be a comfortably warmed and
cheerfully -lighted apartment, which, during
the progress of the sitting, should be kept free
from all intrusions. Circles for enquiry should
always be held in the light.
The Sitters
Those only should be requested to JOin in
the experiment who are willing to devote time
and patience to a methodical pursuit of the
enquiry. Circles entirely composed of either
sex are not so suitable as those in which the
sexes are in proportion. In experimental cir-
cles from five to seven sitters are sufficient.
The Arrangement of Sitters
The sitters should be so arranged that a lady
alternates with a gentleman at the table used.
There is no need to restrict the sitters to any
particular form of table. When the communi-
cation is· established, changes in the seating
of the sitters may be desired by the communi-
cating intelligence. S-uch change should invari-
ably be made and adhered to at subsequent
meetings, unless and until otherwise directed.

The Fundamental Facts of Spiritualism : •

The Phenomena
Do not look for "marvellous phenomena" at
first. The simplest phenomenon that demon-
strates the existence of an agency external to
the sitters is of more importance to the en-
quirer than the more extraordinary phenomena,
which are at first accepted with reserve. The
initial phenomena will most likely take the
form of tilts, or movements of the table. Such
''tilts" or "movements" can be made to serve
as a method of communicating with the unseen
operators by using the following code of sig-
nals, i.e., one "tilt" or "movement" being un-
derstood as "No,'' two as "Doubtful," three as
"Yes," in response to the questions, which
should be addressed to the agent at work as
soon as the movements are obtained. Should
"raps" be heard, the above code of signals can
still be observed. Should any sitter exhibit a
desire to write-as indicated by the movements
of the hand and arm-supply the person so in-
fluenced with a sheet of paper and pencil, and
await results. Should any sitter become en-
tranced, do not get alarmed, nor hastily break
up the sitting, as such cases are rarely danger-
ous.
Forms of Communication
Spirits adopt various forms of communicat-
ing with mankind. Trances, visions, impres-
sions, personations and writing are among the

more general forms resorted to. In most of
these cases the medium is put under a psycho-
logical or mesmeric "control" by the spirit op-
erating, and during the continuance of the state
may deliver addresses, describe spirits present,
and also scenes in the spirit land; personate
the character of departed friends, and repeat
characteristic actions and personal incidents-
names, dates, etc.-connected therewith; and
either by aid of the Planchette, Ouija, or simi-
lar agent, or by a pencil held in the hand in the
ordinary manner, write out messages from the
intelligences communicating. Generally, the
fact of communication is most easily estab-
lished by the process known as "table move-
ments," as above referred to. Seat the com-
pany at the table, and follow the code of signal-
ling previously mentioned when motions or
sounds are obtained. There are many other
forms of communication, but these now stated
will suffice for all practical purposes to help
the enquirer in the early stages of investigation.
The Duration of Circles
Let the circle be continued for not less than
one hour, even if no results are obtained. Twice
in one week is frequently enough to form a
circle. Let it be remembered that all circles
are experimental ; hence no one should be dis-
couraged if phenomena are not obtained at the

first few sittings. Stay with the same circle
for eight sittings at least, and if no results are
then obtained (providing the above conditions
are observed), you may conclude that the requi-
site psychic elements are not presented by the
sitters. In that case the members of the circle
should try the plan of introducing fresh visi-
tors of a suitable character. A single change
is frequently sufficient.
General Suggestions
Endeavour to retain the same sitters at each
sitting.
Music, vocal or instrumental, is advised to
open each meeting. It is not an absolute neces-
sity.
Avoid excitement or fatigue for some hours
before attending the circle. Never indulge in
stimulants previous to a sitting. The forces
used are drawn from the physical and psychical
parts of our nature, and are therefore affected
by the bodily and spiritual states of all con-
cerned.
Do not sit with, or admit to your circle,
anyone whom you dislike, or in whom you
have not perfect confidence. Avoid acrimoni-
ous discussion. Honest scepticism is no bar-
rier to the enquiry, but prejudice and suspicion
are undesirable anywhere.
The absence of visible results is no proof
that no advance has been made. Often most

is done when the least is evident to any of our
senses. Much may have to be done by the
spirit operators before the object of the meet-
ing is accomplished. They are the workers;
therefore it is not unreasonable to ask that you
bring to each meeting of your circle the requi-
sites most desired, patience and perseverance.
If you have any deep-rooted religious objec-
tion to the subject, or any bigoted aversion to
it, leave it entirely alone. You are unsuited to
the enquiry, and \viii derive no benefit there-
from. While the facts crave no one's favour,
they fear no one's opposition, but a scientific
enquiry is no place for the ventilation of intol-
erant opinions or prejudices, religious or scien-
tific.
