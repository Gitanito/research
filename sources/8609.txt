     I   am the publicist of a book that your members and site visitors would absolutely   love.&nbsp; It's &quot;THE MIRACLE OF DEATH&quot; by Betty J. Kovacs, Ph.D. ISBN 0-9721005-3-9   (The Kamlak Center - July 2003).&nbsp; The book has been endorsed by Gary Schwartz   and Joel Martin, among others in consciousness studies and science.&nbsp; Below is a   very brief description of the book.&nbsp;

Within a three-year   period, Dr. Kovacs lost her mother, her son and her husband in three separate   automobile accidents. The book is about her entire family's non-ordinary   experiences surrounding multiple deaths in her family. In this awe-inspiring   narrative Dr. Kovacs shares OBEs, precognitive dreams, visions, and   synchronistic events that opened her family to multiple levels of reality, the   interconnectedness of all life, and the evidence all around us that a planetary   shift in consciousness is under way. Weaving personal, historical and mythic   perspectives, Dr. Kovacs shows us that such individual experiences along with   cutting-edge scientific research support a radical change in the way we think   about death--and life.
