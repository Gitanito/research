 1/1 March 7, 1857-1859.  $1.00 a year.  Devoted to psychometry, spiritualism, and a form of anarchical socialism.  Denton (1823-1883) was a geologist, freethinker, controversialist, and enthusiasm for psychometry (the mental reading of vibrations and emanations from persons and objects), a science he had learned of from the works of J.R. Buchanan.  He had earlier helped edit The Social Revolutionist.  See the note under Buchanan's Journal of Man. His most famous book in that regard was The Soul of Things, or, Psychometric Researches and Discoveries (Wellesley, MA: Mrs. E.M.F. Denton, 1873), which, among other things, unveils the prehistory of the human race. Denton was also the first person to attempt to take paraffin casts of materialized spirits.  Annie Cridge (1825-1875), his sister, was a noted psychometrist and author of a famous pamphlet on "Man's Rights," and it was her powers that converted Denton to spiritualism and psychometry.   University of Michigan.
