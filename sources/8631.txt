Best Evidence,    by Michael Schmicker, Writer's Club Press, Lincoln NE (2000).    </b>    
  &nbsp;              </b>

Michael Schmicker's work is  outstanding.&nbsp; Truly a must-read for skeptics and believers alike.&nbsp; I  really enjoy reading about the different paranormal phenomena and what evidence  is out there to support these phenomena.&nbsp; Although the routine scientific  method may not be adequate to explain paranormal events, it certainly is not the  only method that is recognized by science.&nbsp; Therefore, the best review I  can do of this book is to talk about some of the main concepts for the benefit  of skeptics/scientists/media, and highly recommend reading the Best Evidence for  a larger scope of understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

According to Gallup poll surveys, 93%  of American polled in 1990 believed in one or more of 18 categories of  paranormal phenomena. Id. at 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that  realistically, skeptics probably do believe in some sort of paranormal  events.&nbsp; Moreover, believers in paranormal events do not fit media  portrayals - such as seeking interviews with gullible, mentally-unbalanced  person of low social, educational and economic status.&nbsp; Id. at  11.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you think about this, it is truly  odd that media isn't aware that people such as Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein,  Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Wallace (associate of Darwin), Edgar Mitchell  (former Apollo Astronaut), Chester Carlson (physicist and Xerox inventor), James  McDonnell (yes, the aircraft guy of McDonnell Douglas), Laurence Rockefeller  ($$), Michael Crichton, Winston Churchill, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles  Dickens, Margaret Mead, Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Ford, General  George Patton . . . etc. Id. 12-16.&nbsp; What means is served by  portraying a stereotype that simply is not a majority view?

I really love chapter four.&nbsp; There  are so many examples of new scientific ideas, rejected by science, but later  resurrected and heralded as some of the best inventions of the century.&nbsp;  Just to cite an example,&nbsp;  

&quot;'He ought not to risk his    reputation by presenting the learned body anything which appears so much at    variance with established knowledge, and withal so incredible.' England's    Royal Society rejecting Jenner's smallpox vaccine.&quot; Id. at 31.&nbsp;

Those notable names that were initially  ridiculed include Louis Pasteur (microbiology and rabies cure), Joseph Lister  (germs cause sickness), Albert Einstein, Lord Kelvin (X-rays), the Wright  Brothers (flight), Thomas Edison (phonograph and light bulb). Id. 31-33.

The distinction between  &quot;science&quot; and &quot;scientism&quot; is profound.&nbsp;  &quot;Science&quot; is defined as the process used to find truth.&nbsp; Id  at 37.&nbsp; &quot;In contrast, 'Scientism' is a philosophy of  materialism, masquerading as scientific truth.&nbsp; Paranormal research, has  used the process of science to prove the existence of a variety of phenomena,  that simply doesn't fit within Scientism's philosophy of materialism.&nbsp; If  evidence conflicts with philosophy, the evidence should not be dismissed;  instead, the philosophy should be revised.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Science needs to look at evidence in an  unbiased manner, evaluate the investigational methodology and then review the  properties of what they observe.&nbsp; From there, science comes up with  possible explanations.&nbsp; Some problems arise when scientists systematically  reject challenges to established work and they insist on the experimental method  occurring in a controlled laboratory setting.&nbsp; Id at 34-35.&nbsp;  Some scientists remain so rigid in belief systems&nbsp; that they don't seek the  truth.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not surprising that many experiments effectively  control the method, means, and manner of the exploration and fail to allow for  variables leading to truth.

Schmicker documents foundational  problems with skeptics beliefs.&nbsp; &quot;Skeptics have done valuable and  respectable work in challenging paranormal claims.&quot; Id. at 40.&nbsp;  Healthy skepticism helps to find the truth.&nbsp; A true skeptic is someone who  &quot;express[es] uncertainty or doubt, non belief rather than disbelief.&nbsp;  In contrast, too many skeptics and debunkers are disbelievers, offering answers  rather than questions.&quot;&nbsp;

Skepticism can also be the sign of a  sick mind when motivated by ego and preconceived biases.&nbsp; How much truth  will be gained by a skeptic who portrays all paranormal believers as wrong,  regardless of the evidence?&nbsp; Here are some point, counterpoint arguments  regarding skeptics.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&quot;Skeptics    point to the possibility of errors in observation,&quot; but there are many    documented cases involving &quot;multiple, independent witnesses whose    testimony agrees.&quot; Id. at 36.

&quot;Skeptics warn that some people    who report paranormal events may be biased towards belief in their    reality.&quot;&nbsp; The counterargument is that &quot;many skeptics bring an    equally unscientific bias towards disbelief to their investigations - a    prejudice so strong that they won't accept a phenomenon even if they    personally witness or experience it.&quot; Id.

Skeptics argue that people who    report paranormal events are only looking for attention.&nbsp; The counter    argument is &quot;most eyewitnesses of a strange, paranormal event have little    to gain and much to lose by reporting them.&nbsp; They're usually branded as    wackos and nut cases.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's    just not socially acceptable to profess a belief in a non-material world    beyond the five senses.&nbsp; As a result, under-reporting of these phenomena    is more likely than over-reporting.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;

And finally, what better way to sum up  the philosophy of the book than the ending paragraph in chapter 5,&nbsp;  &quot;Belief in the paranormal, then,    doesn't continue to exist simply because people are ignorant, credulous, or    uneducated.&nbsp; Belief continues because paranormal phenomena - phenomena    that violate known laws of science - continue to occur.&nbsp; They continue to    be seen, felt, experienced and reported, by people of all ages, races,    cultures, and socioeconomic backgrounds; in every country on earth; often in    forms and manifestations unchanged since mankind started recording them four    thousand years ago.&nbsp; Ridicule doesn't make them disappear; the immense    technological achievements and intellectual prestige of modern science cannot    eradicate belief in them.&nbsp; Perhaps it's time to sit down and honestly    examine the best evidence believers and experiencers can offer for the    existence of these science-challenging phenomena.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at    51.
