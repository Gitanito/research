  		              		Experience Description   

    When my experience happened, it made a huge impression on me. I was about five or six years old and had a cold with fever. Usually I would take cold medicine, but this time it was not working very well. Mom took me to the hospital to have an intravenous drip  with penicillin. Thereafter, Mom told me that  I am allergic to pencillin. Yet, I took the pills that contain penicillin quite often, so I am sure that I was not that sensitive to it. I might have been weaker  because I did not have breakfast in the morning. I was shivering with cold as soon as the fluid injection was in my body. Mom and the nurse rushed  me to a hospital bed and  covered me with several blankets. I still felt chilled to the bone.  I couldn't  move, not even a finger, from the weight of  all the blankets weighing down on me. I don't  remember if I talked to my Mom or the nurse.
  
  As my whole body was aching all over, I found myself floating and I passed through the heavy layers of blankets. I felt as light as a feather and there was nothing on me. I was buoyant in a face-downward position. I saw clearly that there was another “I” lying on the bed. I was  watching the nurse walked back and forth and hearing her conversations with my Mom.  It all felt hollow such as people talking in a cave without echoes. It was not comprehensible what they were saying.
  
  In a split second, I came through a tunnel and to a place filled with bright light that did not hurt eyes. The soft bright light felt very comfortable and warm. I sensed this is a vast, boundless place. Even the area my feet stood on  had that gentle white light. It felt not solid at all. There were no sounds or and nobody was there. I did not feel uncomfortable. On the contrary, I felt I was home. 

  The entire incident was short and no other special events happened afterward. Suddenly, I was pull back into my body. The pulling sensation felt like souls were ripped in some movie-scene I saw before. Coming back to body was fast, and all body parts were under control and  I didn't feel cold anymore. With all the blankets piled up on me, I asked my Mom to remove them from me. My Mom was the pharmacist at this hospital. We used to live in the staff dormitory, so I am quite familiar with the surroundings there. I still have vivid memories of the treatment ward, where I was when I passed out.
