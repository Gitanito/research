  		              		Experience Description   

    The first thing I remember was seeing a huge, round, and colorful opening or pathway. At the end of the pathway was a white church and other small white buildings. The sky was blue. I no longer felt anger, sadness, or regret. I also had a strange feeling that I can't explain. I don't know what love is, but I guess that this feeling was that someone loved me and forgave me. I badly wanted to stay. The emotions were so strong. There were four male figures on my left side. They were dressed in long gray overcoats. They didn't have faces as we know them. Rather, their faces were glowing with a strong, bright light shinging from their face.  We didn't have verbal communication. We communicated through emotional feelings. Three other figures appeared on my right side.  They looked like the other figures with the same color coats and faces of bright light.  They came towaards me in a non-threatening way.  

  Then I woke up. The doctor told me what happened, but I didn't care because I wanted to go back there.  

  Before, I didn't believe in life after death.  But now, I am confused.  This was not a hallucination because it was so real. I can never forget the  feelings,  warmness, and the knowledge that I was loved. I did not want to talk to anyone about this, but I made an appointment to speak to a priest.

   I am not afraid of death now.

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-related. While under general anesthesia. CPR given.     Other: I bled out during surgery.  The doctor told me that I had only about 5 minutes before they called time of death.   

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      No.    I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I saw everything, but my feelings were intense.  I was not scared. I felt at home, with peace. I felt complete and that someone knew who I was.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         When I entered the pathway  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     I can't find the words for this.   

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I was getting ready to go to the gym

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      There was no sound. Communications were not heard, but I understood through emotions.

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     I was standing in a tunnel, or I guess it was more like a huge entrance. There were 7 men who had faces of very bright light.

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     It was a pathway where I had intense feelings and saw amazing colors. I felt whole as a person, without guilt, sadness, sorrow or anger. 

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         The emotions were very strong. I did not know what they were, but I felt as one and a complete self.  All the negative emotions were gone.

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about myself or others.     I knew who i was as a person.  I felt whole and did not carry guilt from my life on earth. I have PTSD. Yet, I felt relief and forgiveness that no medicine could  give me. Most importantly, I felt loved, which I felt I did not deserve because of my guilt. 

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  The seven men were getting closer to me.  I started to go backwards, but I wanted to go forward.

Coming out of surgery, the doctor was telling about the 4 or 5 minutes left before they were going to declare me as dead.
