called it the last card because he said
this is all a giant game and it&#39;s a
dangerous game and I think everyone
listening today knows that are we ready
for the next one
so this next Russian speaker
maybe later today if we can get Timothy
online we&#39;ll pivot back to him but we&#39;ll
just roll with these people can be
flexible
what happens with live things out of
Russia to hear
7-Eleven
this is um Professor Alexander Stephen
off all of these people are also
scientists economic experts they&#39;re all
experts from the Ecology of the unknown
foreign
foreign
control
control

foreign
Williams
now this is a man that we had probably
been getting on another General
very important yeah
we did commit to doing this this was a
sweep I think he gave him 26. Americans
yeah
Italian
ism
foreign
foreign
foreign
a little bit
permission
foreign
foreign
this has been going on since 1945 and
you&#39;ll hear Paula Harris
talk about this as well in a case that
that is more significant than Roswell
from 1945. so this is a theme a motif
that runs over the last 75 plus years
since the dawn of the atomic and nuclear
age and that is these civilizations are
very concerned because when we went to
that level of Technology
we ended up not only damaging the Earth
and our species and all species on Earth
with radiation and plutonium that causes
cancers and mutations and what have you
but also it tears through the fabric of
space-time
trans-dimensionally and May in fact be
doing greater damage in those worlds
this is a key Point everyone listening
must understand that is why we humans
since the mid-40s are viewed as a huge
problem in the cosmos and why Eisenhower
was approached by a group of
extraterrestrials saying please stop
this process make peace and join an
interplanetary family
and live in peace on this planet because
it was not only about the survival of a
human species it&#39;s also that when we do
these things we don&#39;t realize in quantum
physics in the entangled Universe the
degree to which what Einstein called the
spooky effect were the same particle
could be in two places at once
Etc and so on that the cosmos isn&#39;t this
straight line linear existence it&#39;s a
Quantum conscious hologram woven
together
and when we do something of a critical
mass of say Hiroshima or what have you
and the things we have now these weapons
now that he&#39;s referring to are orders of
magnitude more destructive than ones we
dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima it
actually creates damage not just on
Earth but throughout the cosmos and now
you&#39;re understanding why the ETS are
here one of the reasons they&#39;re here is
that they&#39;re very concerned about what
we do to this beautiful world by a small
group of sociopaths
and warmockers but what it&#39;s doing to
their worlds
so we have to understand that and this
is why these people are coming forward
but now
this is Timothy Timothy is the trainer
of cosmonauts and astronauts from all
over the world they go to him to be
trained to go into space he&#39;s amazing
he&#39;s also a musician he&#39;s got little
children he lives in a dome house
community
and he is going to tell us now uh he&#39;s
going to give a 45 minutes I don&#39;t know
what he&#39;s going to say nope
unfortunately we&#39;re at the point now
where we have to take a break at 2 50.
so Timothy I&#39;m sorry but you know we
kind of had to extend things because we
couldn&#39;t get you in so
we have about 33 minutes
you can do it if you can sort of go
through things the really critical
things and and I really appreciate that
I&#39;m sorry we&#39;ve had these technical
difficulties but so we have about 33
minutes we blame it on the Russians we
believe everything okay but it&#39;s okay
Timothy thank you thank you timofey and
it&#39;s very good to see you here
and um I I really welcome your
involvement and this is a very
courageous uh guy that I&#39;ve gotten to
know through zoom in the last few months
and the work he&#39;s doing is really
important for the world I want to thank
you so go ahead MFA you you have the you
have the floor
okay thank you Dr Greer
hello everyone uh who&#39;s watching us uh
hello Dr Greer and all people in the
house
my name is Timothy Igor I am the trainer
of cosmonauts at the Gagarin cosmonauts
Training Center Star City Russia also I
am the general director of the
association Ecology of the unknown which
is a non-governmental organization the
largest one and the most recognized
official organization in Russia dealing
with the unknown phenomena of nature
Cosmos and human abilities
UFOs in that number of course
now I&#39;m going to briefly tell you about
the association
so you can understand where it all comes
from
the association Ecology of the unknown
was established to unite efforts and
coordinate actions of individuals and
legal entities that conduct scientific
research contributing to the evolution
of mankind in the field of studying of
the unknown phenomena of nature Cosmos
and human abilities in order to further
take them into account
and deploy them
in Practical work including in
preparation to the adoption of an
important state and international
decisions
so that&#39;s what we need to understand uh
so now I&#39;m going to present and talk
about a few cases that our experts were
dealing with the most famous UFO
sightings in Russia
and
please know that we have a lot of people
that we&#39;re working with among them
military men
phds can PhD candidates
um
a lot of different experts in different
fields and uh we have some connections
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
Russian Federation
and other significant organizations in
Russia whose employees are also part of
our team so today I&#39;m speaking on behalf
of all these people
uh and now I&#39;m going to present you
something
so let&#39;s
will you please show the picture
on case one
Okay so
can you see it uh the whole
oh yes now I can see it
uh this is the petrozavosk phenomenon it
was 1977.
a large bright jellyfish-like object
appeared in the sky of petrozavorsk
Russia in corellia it was also
simultaneously seen in a number of other
cities of Russia and Finland
the phenomenon was observed by a large
number of eyewitnesses
some made sketches some saw it through a
telescope some took pictures of it
the object
burned holes in the windows of the
houses of petrozavorsk with the Jets
coming out of it
as you can see the Jets are coming out
of it
uh
but not a single living being was harmed
so this this is another picture and now
please show the burned holes in the
windows
yes
next one
next one
next one
as you see the holes are burned through
the glass didn&#39;t fell apart
next one
next
this
are some articles from Russian
newspapers back in the day in 1977
reports about The Phenomenon with
pictures were published both in the
local and in central press
which gave the Soviet public and
a reason to study the unexplained
phenomena even Brezhnev was also read
into this
initially the phenomena was explained as
a as an as a natural phenomenon but
later they begin to tell that it
appeared as the result of the launch of
a satellite and an unsuccessful launch
of a ballistic missile conducted nearby
at about the same time
but one of our experts General sydnov
the video of which you have been just
watching
before I connected
who was later the armament&#39;s chief of
the USSR and was officially in charge of
collecting the UFO data
told our experts told us that he
received reports that the object
was 300 meters in diameter and was
moving like this
from north to south of Russia as you
know Russia is a big country
in no time and they saw the object on
Raiders
so that&#39;s not
this that&#39;s definitely not something
of this world
okay let&#39;s go to case number two
the January 29th
1986
near the village of dalne gorsk in
Russia a UFO was observed in the form of
a bright self-luminous ball
it crashed in the mountains
so this is a sketch of what eyewitnesses
saw
there&#39;s not no actual
photo of this event
but
at the crash site
some objects were retrieved
here they are
let me talk about them a little bit
the objects were examined in in the
laboratory by chemists and other experts
instances of iron balls had a very high
degree of hardness they could not be cut
with steel tools
and they could only be cut with a
diamond according to experts the
composition of the balls included almost
the entire periodic table
and here at the right you can see a
little mesh
this is a very curious mesh
in one of the samples of the mesh they
found fragments of the thinnest
17 microns threads
which in turn consisted of even thinner
fibers Twisted into bundles
those appear to be very thin golden
wires
experts conclude that such the
technology is impossible even at the
current level of Technology development
and what is
uh
interesting about this
they had they put they put a monument
like this and many people came to this
place to visit
and to examine it as well
okay let&#39;s go to case number three
this is a this is a table
which is
put there
it said that on January 29 19
86 a UFO crashed here
ologist was the first to examine the
crash site that&#39;s what is written here
in Russian
the case number three
uh was a landing
of a flying saucer and there were three
boys playing at the place
which were separately debriefed
and their testimony is matched
so that&#39;s the drawings that an artist
draw according to their testimonies
this this is the object that they saw
these are three extraterrestrials that
came out of the vehicle and communicated
with them
again no one was harmed
but after that event varanish the city
where it took place
became very famous and there were people
from different countries which even made
some documentaries on this event
let&#39;s get okay let&#39;s go to case number
four uh here&#39;s the boy
the witness
okay another photo okay this is the
landing site
uh here&#39;s a video
that took our Russian cosmonaut Ivan
Wagner in 2020 he was filming northern
lights over Antarctica
so watch somewhere in the middle of the
screen to the left you will see five
objects in a row
so this
okay there will be another
piece let&#39;s watch on
this is the Northern Lights
it&#39;s a zoom in you see one object flying
and at the top of the screen and in the
middle you&#39;ll see five objects
they&#39;re going in a row
and there will be two more this is again
the same and there will be two more
right here
following those five two more
and one more
so
he reported this to the chief of Ross
Cosmos but no comments followed
still
okay after we have briefly viewed this
four cases of as Dr Greer use uses to
say evidence
I I&#39;d like you to watch
to take one step higher and watch the
video of one of our best expert he&#39;s the
president of the association Ecology of
the unknown
and
he will talk about
what
we can do with this evidence depending
on our level of morality and ethics it
depends on you let&#39;s view the video
Let&#39;s watch it
hello my friends
please excuse me but to save time I will
read the text
every word in it has its meaning
I&#39;m Alexander Simeon president of the
association Ecology of the unknown which
has been operating for more than 30
years I am also a professor and a
Brazilian member of the Academy of
geopolitical problems for 45 years I
have been in the field of studying of
the so-called anomalous phenomena
including the UFO phenomenon I
personally know almost all scientists
and Specialists and researchers who
created the foundations of Russian
ufology and have made their contribution
to the ufology worldwide for about 15
years while working in the group of the
Soviet Pioneer of ethology Felix urovic
ziegel I just like the most researchers
believed that the more observational
data about UFOs is there and the more
reliable the weaknesses of their
appearance are the sooner the state
authorities will stop covering up and
classifying information about them the
faster the full-scale scientific study
of the phenomenon will begin and the
media will stop relegating its study to
the level of simple curiosity and that&#39;s
when we will finally know the nature of
the UFO phenomenon probably related to
its extraterrestrial origin I as well as
numerous Russian and foreign researchers
hoped that the official scientific
recognition of UFOs will encourage the
advancement of humanity into the
universe will facilitate contact with
the brothers in Consciousness as well as
it will expand our knowledge of the
world
but that didn&#39;t happen moreover the
official scientific World resolutely
distanced is itself from the
consideration of the problem marking it
as pseudoscientific state structures
have taken a vow of silence and the
media continued to cover the problem in
a superficial vulgar way and this is
despite the fact that over decades
hundreds of serious informal
associations in many countries of the
world gathered a rays of thousands
hundreds of thousands of cases of UFO
sightings in addition they periodically
began to feed the public with
Declassified those smeared Archives of
UFO sightings the collection of which
has long been conducted in a closed mode
by some government agencies in a number
of countries however the methods of
mathematical statistics correlative and
regression analysis more than 30 years
ago allowed to identify several features
of the UFO phenomenon that objectively
talk about a set of properties inherent
only to it the same for different
regions of the world however based on
all the accumulated archives and
investigations conducted it is still
impossible to say anything unambiguously
certain about the nature of UFOs in
scientific terms except for one thing
the phenomenon objectively exists
the question is not about the reality of
the existence and presence of the UFO
phenomenon on Earth
it&#39;s about how we Humanity should
respond to it correctly
UFOs are associated with the activities
of extraterrestrial civilizations this
is the most obvious version clarifying
considerations is not so important right
now whether UFOs are messengers from
other planets or from other space-time
Dimensions other worlds frequencies it
doesn&#39;t matter it seems that it would be
more correct now to refer to them as the
other worlders from the UFO archives it
follows that there are several other
world civilizations the description of
the type and properties of their
representatives has essentially a
literary tone to it but it is important
that these descriptions based on the
so-called context stories have one thing
in common among the other worlders there
is no one who would relate to us in a
hostile or aggressive manner there are
descriptions of an indifferent attitude
to people there is neutral there is good
attitude but there is no hostile or
aggressive
and for all the time of communication
with the other worlders of the most
different contactees there were no cases
of presentation to Earth civilization of
any ultimatum requirements terms
not a single bit of hostility or
aggressiveness was shown by the other
worlders
there is also no recorded case of
intentional purposeful infliction of
harm to people by other worlders cases
of UFO impact on the equipment took
place most often as a response to the
actions of people in 1977 the 33rd U.N
General Assembly considered EQ phone
memorandum on these impacts but in the
future with an objective study of such
cases it became clear that the injured
Witnesses often military unknowingly
found themselves in the zones of action
of force and other fields inherent in
UFOs and unwittingly violated the
unknown to earthlings safety rules for
contacts with UFOs UFOs have not
provoked a single military conflict
their presence near Military or secret
facilities has the nature of supervision
but does not indicate in any way that
their intentions are dangerous for
personnel and Equipment there were cases
when namely the presence of youthfuls in
the areas of basing of strategic strike
systems zeroed out the probability of
combat launches of nuclear missiles we
should also not forget that any
peculiarities of the behavior of other
subjects for example animals we humans
perceive only through the prism of our
own established views beliefs and
inclinations including those of
aggressiveness hostility evil good fear
Etc
there is no reason to believe that UFOs
and representatives of extraterrestrial
civilizations are hostile or aggressive
in relation to the Earthlings
manifestations of the ue4 phenomenon are
exclusively peaceful in nature
so here we are the UFO phenomenon that
was not taken seriously for 70 years
that has not become an important subject
of study of the world science the
phenomenon which they abused for filming
Thrillers about bad aliens now turned
out to be in demand moreover at the
official level of U.S Congress it can be
employed when playing according to the
expression of vernophon brown of the
last card that is for implementation of
the fourth stage of coming to the New
World Order
according to the major spending Bill
signed by the president of the United
States on December 27 2020
the minister of defense and the Director
of National Intelligence have to report
until June 2021 to the Committees of
Congress on intelligence and Armed
Forces what their agencies know about
UFOs
the Pentagon must provide a report on
unidentified aerial objects and
phenomena
which should contain a detailed analysis
of UFO data collected by the department
of Navy intelligence by the task force
on unidentified aerial phenomena and the
FBI
the Pentagon must identify any potential
threats to National Security
emanating from UFOs
whether China or Russia could be behind
such activities the report must be
public but it may contain secret data
such formulation of the president&#39;s
instructions
makes the following steps possible
U.S military and intelligence Services
confirm the presence of a whole spectrum
of identified potential threats from
UFOs after all for many decades
taxpayers is money from the U.S budget
was spent to finance the ongoing
unacknowledged special access projects
World mass media starts a massive
brainwashing of the population of the
planet a simulation of an alien invasion
takes place
UFOs are declared enemies of humanity
U.S military industrial complex receives
contracts for the development and
production of new weapon systems to
compensate for UFO threats
allies countries join the U.S defense
program providing their financial
technical military territorial resources
raw materials political and other
resources
Russia China and other non-aligned
countries are declared traitors to
humanity against them strict political
economic informational military space
and other sanctions are introduced a
global operational headquarters is
created for the reflection of UFO
threats the sole commander of the planet
is elected
the role of the UN is being reviewed and
virtually reset
The Authority is exercised by the
managers of the deep state
for serving the elite a moderately
well-fed computer concentration camp is
created out of the population the launch
of weapon systems into space begins
activities of the most nations of the
planet are controlled under the threat
of the use of weapons from outer space
the probability of a global Military
conflict reaches its limit
what does the UFO phenomenon have to do
with all this absolutely nothing they
just needed a convenient excuse
and now the most important thing in the
Soviet Union there has been started and
then continued and modernized
the methodology for making contact with
representatives of let&#39;s say Supreme
intelligent powers of the cosmos the
task was said to achieve bilateral
meaningful communication with them the
goal was not to get some momentary
situational hints or new technologies
but to gain knowledge of the
cornerstones fundamental laws of the
universe about the main principles on
which the cosmos is built the
ideological and scientific basis for
setting this goal were the researchers
of the great thinkers Russian cosmists
of the 19th and 20th centuries such as
birdiev selkowsky vernotsky chizefsky
kosarev kaznachev and others the goal
was achieved
among the many topics raised during this
communication was the question of the
possibility of putting into the space
environment over so familiar to
earthlings attribute like weapons
the answer was immediate it was strict
absolutely unambiguous not allowing any
double interpretations
it is unacceptable to bring any weapons
into space that both Soviet and Russian
leadership
has been consistent for decades back in
the day and now
firmly defending the principles of
exclusively peaceful exploration of
outer space
peaceful people of planet Earth there
are significantly more of us than a
handful of those who want to establish a
cosmic dictatorship on Earth be vigilant
demand an absolute ban of the placement
of weapons in outer space
thank you hey Timothy so if you want to
say a few more things
yes I have uh four minutes more so I I&#39;m
going to say something more okay
okay so after all that has just been
said by Alexander simonov
I want together with you to look into
the future and see what we the people
can do so there are three options
uh one uh how the situation can develop
uh one an extraterrestrial ship lands on
the lawn of the White House the
ambassadors of the other World come out
of their ship and the people get a
proposal from them to initiate and
maintain a peaceful contact
so this is very unlikely to happen
because
extraterrestrials know see and
understand that Humanity has an
extremely
now has an extremely low level of
morality of ethics and
such an event can cause and an
appropriate
reaction of people second the initiative
group that promotes the idea of
exclusively peaceful exploration of
space that&#39;s being us
manages to reach out to the leaders of
their states officials in high positions
uh so in other words decision makers
this outcome is still more likely than
the describing in paragraph one but as
you may well know
uh
such people
who are in high positions and have
access to big money and big Power are
often more uh
I have more let&#39;s say various human
vices and they have
they highly unlikely that they are going
to change fast and we need it fast
and the third option is that we peaceful
inhabitants of the Earth
willing and ready to change for the
better unite our desires our efforts and
aspirations in a in an international
social movement the goals and objectives
of which are simple and understandable
to every person on Earth
and we in Russia have already started
such a social movement
we named it the ethics of the cosmos
because ethics is a set of universal
laws
which one have to follow to be able to
evolve and travel throughout the
Universe
that is by the way
the reason why there are no hostile
extraterrestrials
because you have to have a certain level
of ethics
after before you&#39;ll learn the
trans-dimensional physics and you can
travel to other worlds otherwise
you can bring harm to people
so
and we invite everyone to join this
Movement we can discuss the details if
you&#39;re willing to do this if you want to
have more information you can check our
website
and before I finish I would like to show
you
one more last picture of my presentation
which I personally call the hardest
evidence of the fact that we are not
alone in the universe
the picture is named Hubble Legacy field
okay what you see here in this picture
is what the Hubble telescope sees on a
tiny piece of the sky about a moon size
if you look from the surface of the
Earth
by the way these are not Stars these are
galaxies
265
000 of them in this little piece of the
sky each containing billions of stars
each star possibly having a planetary
system very much like our solar system
where life could emerge just like on our
planet here under the sun
and you can also see this picture in
detail at the Hubble
uh website
but someday you just go under the stars
Raise Your Head Up
see the Magnificent beautiful and living
universe
and don&#39;t you tell me that you feel
alone because we&#39;re not alone
there are many other civilizations out
there and they&#39;re waiting for us to join
them in peace
so people of the world
let&#39;s put ourselves together
change this world for the better
and enter this bright future
this new world
that together we can take
appreciate it
thank you Timothy and I know it&#39;s very
late in Moscow on behalf of all of us
and the 20th anniversary of the
disclosure project I want to please
extend a thank you uh to all those who
made videos for us and how much we
appreciate their coming forward it takes
a lot of Courage for these sorts of of
generals and other people to say what
they have said and we honor their
courage thank you so much
thank you
thank you as well
hello Carol
hello Timothy
so if you want to have like one more
minute if you want to wrap up and then
I&#39;ll uh we&#39;re going to show a little
three o&#39;clock in the morning for them
we&#39;re going to show a little video
that&#39;s a sort of a celebratory video of
our 20 years uh but just in one moment
because we&#39;re running just real quickly
I&#39;m sorry we didn&#39;t get to see all of
the videos but we will post them on
peaceanspace.com again go down the
introduction and you will see timofey&#39;s
website link he also is chairing the
ethics of the cosmos project that we can
all join in with and you can learn from
because they&#39;re going to be providing a
lot of information again there&#39;s 700
videos or so that you&#39;ve posted on that
website about the ziegel&#39;s readings a
lot of these speakers we didn&#39;t get to
see Valentina but you&#39;ll see her she&#39;s a
psychoanalyst a psychologist who chairs
that Center for Trans transmission no
um transdimensional of the cause oh yes
of Consciousness the transformation of
Consciousness very important and she was
taken into the woods as part of an eight
people selection from the government to
meet two extraterrestrial beings so she
is on the website now you&#39;ll see her and
sorry we didn&#39;t get to see her in person
right now in the video but these are
amazing people as Stephen said they&#39;re
so courageous just like you because
you&#39;re going to be going out with the
ethics of the cosmos kind of
conversation now you see the Russian
position you just heard it from
Professor simenov wow I mean this is the
Russian position now they&#39;re calling for
the treaty to prevent the placement of
weapons in outer space read it you&#39;ll
learn about that too and please go out
and promote it so thank you all for
being participants in all of this and
what you&#39;re about to do go for it thank
you
so we&#39;re going to do just a um a really
quick little celebratory video that
Michael put together and then we&#39;re
going to take a 20 minute break okay
thank you
we are here today
we are here
foreign
and we have witnesses here today that
have shown you that these
extraterrestrial beings that these
crafts that have come here are now not
UFOs they&#39;re identified flying objects
and we know that they have beings in
them
and we have witnesses here who have told
you that they can shut down our missile
silos they can stop a rocket going into
space that&#39;s a test we have witnesses
here who have worked in the classified
departments who have the courage to come
forward here they actually photographed
the UFO following the missile as it
climbed into space and Shining a beam on
it which neutralized the missile
if you accept the multi-dimensional
theory it&#39;s highly likely that we&#39;ve
done a hell of a lot of damage in
somebody else&#39;s world they might even
have done more so we did
there is no evidence I wish to emphasize
that these life forms from elsewhere are
hostile towards us
but there is a great deal of evidence
that they are concerned with our
hostility
an alien had come off the craft and had
been shot by a military policeman and
apparently was wounded was heading for
McGuire
foreign I got out in 1989 we had catalog
57 different species you have
individuals that look very much like you
and myself that could walk among Among
Us and you wouldn&#39;t even notice the
difference the entities that we did
catalog were in fact humanoid now this
created a situation where the scientific
Community was trying to figure out why
that would be the case because you would
expect that if life evolved with other
planets that they would take on some
type of other being so to speak not
necessarily look humanoid or be bipedal
such as we are but apparently we got
quite a few of the species out there
that are humanoid in appearance and that
creates a question that yet has to be
answered by science
these discs were hovering off the floor
without any visible means of support
they were referred to as alien
reproduction Vehicles also nicknamed the
flux liner because they used high
voltage electricity
foreign
okay welcome everyone and again all the
thousands of people who are online
watching I hope you enjoyed that I&#39;m
sorry we&#39;re running a little bit late
had some technical difficulties but in
the scheme of things it&#39;s all right
um and I just want to give you a little
overview I&#39;m going to spend about an
hour or so dealing with some really key
important information particularly the
uh
aircraft that are man-made that have
been posing as uh UFOs the uh
information that we have on a new
photograph of some type of humanoid
being dissected in the 1920s we&#39;re going
to go through that uh in this next hour
I&#39;m going to be going through of course
the very well known uh case of what
we&#39;re been Rich uh wrote to a friend
what his assessment of this issue was
and confirmed that they were both
man-made and extraterrestrial
but I think what I want to start off
with is more recent so I I&#39;ve shared in
pieces here and there what we were doing
towards the end of the uh last
Administration for president Trump and
uh vice president Pence
I was not able to reach anyone in that
administration at the level of the
office of the president or vice
president unfortunately reliably until
uh August September of 2020. so kind of
late to the party
at that point I had
the CEO of a think tank and consultancy
uh in Washington DC uh A-10 Associates
who the CEO of which very close friends
with Pence family and and knew the Trump
family who 100 supportive of what we&#39;re
trying to do to avoid World War III
um and endless war and particularly
weaponizing space and portraying these
Interstellar visitors as a national
security threat
but unfortunately we&#39;re a little late to
the party
and by the time uh unacknowledged had
had hundreds of millions of views and
this counterintelligence and
disinformation operation known as to the
Stars Academy ttsa went public with the
Tic Tac and other videos
unfortunately at that point we knew that
there was a
countermeasure to what unacknowledged
was telling the public because when you
hit
hundreds of millions of people it goes
viral then they&#39;re going to do something
so that the Genesis of that we knew was
the beginning of them launching what
Werner Von Brown warned about
the hoaxing of an alien threat where
they could unite the world around a
militaristic response to this
and at that point I realized you know
we&#39;re really in trouble
and we&#39;re going to have to do something
to sort of get the narrative back the
first thing we did was to create through
the help of Many Of You Close Encounters
of the fifth kind
which also became a number one
documentary on Amazon and iTunes and all
over the world and it&#39;s now on Amazon
Prime anyone can see it for free if they
have Prime uh and on other sites uh that
was a call to action for Grassroots what
what Timothy ikorov the trainer of
cosmonauts in in Russia just said where
we come together as a movement that are
Grassroots where we make peaceful
contact with these civilizations and
bypass the National Security State and
take the matter into the hands of We the
People which is how it actually should
be and so that of course went forward
and about the time that curse picked up
enormous momentum in the last 12 months
uh they then pivot towards this uh big
problem with the Trump Administration
having been targeted
at the level of the president and the
vice president was very effective
counterintelligence disinformation
now let me explain how this works
probably you all know about the Iraq War
and how we
through the vice president Cheney&#39;s
office cherry-picked intelligence
so that Colin Powell the secretary of
state would go to the U.N and talk about
the Fearsome weapons of mass destruction
that Saddam Hussein had you know I&#39;m no
fan of Saddam Hussein he was obviously a
thug and a dictator and they&#39;re all over
the world
however he did not have those weapons
and it was known he did not have them
however it was enough to Stampede the
American people and the Congress into a
disastrous war and was all based on
knowingly false and host in some cases
intelligence
Colin Powell the Secretary of State who
had been chairman of the joint Jesus
staff by the way it wasn&#39;t like he
wasn&#39;t familiar with military and
intelligence operations
admitted later that he was deceived and
his chief of staff went on the record
saying that they were deceived by a
intelligence operation out of the West
Wing Run by the Vice President
Cheney
of course that ship sailed a while back
I&#39;ll get into some things that happened
there that will stun you
and
with a weapon
electronic systems on satellites
but
when we get into looking at how this
runs you also have to go all the way
back to the era of Ronald Reagan
and I met with a colonel not long ago
before he passed away and then Colonel
Holman
and Colonel Holman had been on a
committee back in the Carter transition
Lake Carter years in early Ronald Reagan
presidency to convince the president of
the need for the Strategic Defense
Initiative Star Wars
and it wasn&#39;t really getting much
traction
for as a policy initiative in terms of
conventional geopolitical
exigencies and requirements until they
played
the last card and he admitted to me that
they would went in with cherry-picked
and distorted information and convinced
Ronald Reagan that there was an alien
threat and of course that&#39;s reflected in
his speech the United Nations and a few
other speeches where the president said
oh wouldn&#39;t our job of uniting the world
be easier if we if we could come unite
against a common threat alien threat so
unfortunately you know you had an actor
from Hollywood and then had governor in
California Ronald Reagan who was easy to
move through cherry picking and spinning
of information to go to the policy
decision
these classified projects wanted
this happens all the time in in the
Congress in the White House and in other
capitals because the people who run
these unacknowledged special access
projects first and foremost are masters
of psychological warfare psyops and
psychological and social engineering
very good at it extremely good at it
it&#39;s why the CI director in 1953
CI director Smith says we have the
document it&#39;s in my books
and it says
that the UFO matter
has a great potential
for a psychological warfare operations
well that&#39;s what he was talking about
and so that was something that was
actually put into play in the early 50s
and perhaps in some milder way before
that
uh
in the 40s but it definitely began at
that point so we have to understand that
our
democracy which Eisenhower warned was
vulnerable to these kinds of
machinations and extreme secrecy that
could threaten our security and our
peace
that&#39;s what Eisenhower said on his last
speeches of the world before he left
office before Jack Kennedy became
president
and what I&#39;ve learned is people who are
in positions with access to the
presidency often are the people moved
into place
to be able to do exactly that the
gentleman whose letter I quoted from at
the opening who set up my meeting with
the director of the CIA in 1993 flat out
when I asked him
is it possible that the director of the
CIA really doesn&#39;t hasn&#39;t been read into
this or briefed on it is no he&#39;s I said
well what about the president he says
well the president has just been brushed
off
and I said how is that even possible
this is my naive days as a young doctor
stepping into that world
I&#39;ve never been in the government and
don&#39;t want to be but he said oh yeah I
was a staffer for Ronald Reagan&#39;s
National Security Council
and and we didn&#39;t want the old man to
know we just lied to him I said you lied
to the president of the United States he
said oh yeah every day all the time
welcome to Washington so you have to get
into a mindset of understanding how this
is played
um you know your civics lesson and the
naivete and what&#39;s presented on the
mainstream media what you&#39;ve read in
your history books and all this
throw it away and that&#39;s just a PR stop
it&#39;s not how this country&#39;s been running
since World War II
so
I don&#39;t say that with any Pride my
mother&#39;s ancestors were the original
prisoner of war with the British
anyway and my dad was half Cherokee the
native peoples of this land
but when you look at this you realize
that we have a very big constitutional
crisis and so when I was approached by
these folks
to put a briefing together for the
president the vice president back in the
fall
in the summer
and so I&#39;ll do it and I said but you
have to be our
um liaison and it has to be handed to
them
off-site that does not go through the
security system and they were able to do
that because it otherwise been
intercepted put aside
so that group worked diligently we we&#39;re
still close and working of course
obviously it&#39;s irrelevant in terms of
that that Administration they&#39;re out
and
we also did a about a 20-minute video
brief summary that was handed to the
vice president the president and was
also sent actually to Russia as well for
President Putin and what&#39;s important
about that is that we were trying to get
the president to Pivot away from
the space force
and the green lighting of weaponization
of space
Etc and so on
I was horrified what I my worst fear
when I heard about the formation of the
space force and also when these this
counterintelligence group with Luis
helazando and Chris melon these other
people went public was that in fact
the train to left station and that they
had effectively pulled the trigger on
the ramp up to this false flag operation
and in fact that&#39;s what was confirmed
what was confirmed to me from people
very close to the president vice
president is that they had been targeted
with very aunt
hateful disinformation about the alien
threat and that they were convinced that
it was an existential threat to this
world
now into that disaster I stepped
unfortunately it also was a disaster of
this election
so it wasn&#39;t easy
this is the original letter they wrote
on my behalf to the president the vice
president and this is the briefing
document for president Trump and
president vice president Pence
now our recommendation just to be clear
was that they steer away from that
narrative that they do a joint
announcement with other world leaders
um and religious leaders around the
world saying that we&#39;re not alone that
they&#39;re not hostile they&#39;re concerned
about what we&#39;re doing in space we come
together and keep all weapons out of
space and develop a rock Crush mall and
a diplomatic initiative to make contact
peacefully with these civilizations so
we can go forward
um obviously that didn&#39;t happen we&#39;re
trying to make that happen before
January 20th and of course it was one
catastrophe after another after another
you know I was on the phone and up all
night you know with with half what
happened on on January 6th
um
and we won&#39;t go into all the Gory detail
of that I mean it&#39;s not important it&#39;s
over
but that is what we&#39;ve been doing of
course you know I&#39;ve been doing this at
a certain level for different places
around the world since the early 90s
with Clinton administration forward this
was the scariest
situation I&#39;ve ever seen because in
other presidencies we knew that they
were doing things contestantly like Dick
Cheney is on this Committee of two or
three hundred along with George H.W bush
senior
and a number of other folks that I know
about and some of whom I met with over
the years but they were sort of moving
they were keeping it
Subrosa underneath
and it was not in the mainstream media
in that narrative and it wasn&#39;t coming
out of the government officially
that all changed the beta test a trial
balloon for it was the ttsa in broglio
where they were everything they released
the Tic Tac had every story in the
mainstream media was and it&#39;s a threat
to the National Security and it&#39;s a
national security threat and they&#39;re
invading our bases and they&#39;re
interfering with our nuclear wealth
everything was couched
and a xenophobic fear-based manner and
stories like that that once were
forbidden to be published in the New
York Times this subject was redlined I&#39;m
quoting I was told this by another New
York Times we don&#39;t cover this stuff
suddenly simultaneously
it appears in all the media the
mainstream media both digital
cable news CNN Fox News New York Times
and globally in other media
that&#39;s when I knew they hit the button
they had hit the button go and their
lackeys and the Shields and the media
who actually work undercover as
journalists and editors
were ordered carry this story
now they don&#39;t carry the disclosure
project Witnesses and videos or
documents which are much more
dispositive and much more evidence than
what ttsa released
however
they redid it that way because the
people who are the mouthpieces appearing
in the media were all sticking to the
talking points too wit to be specific
that
these are a threat to the National
Security and we have to find out what
they are and number two we don&#39;t know
what they are
we&#39;re going to come on something new you
APS
and we don&#39;t know how they operate or
fly
we don&#39;t know how they&#39;re moving
never in their mind we&#39;ve been building
them since the 1940s and 50s
experimentally and fully operationally
since October 1954 that&#39;s what we&#39;re
going to show you
now
this charade is very dangerous
because in the last month both the
ranking member the Senate intelligence
committee Marco Rubio and the Director
of National Intelligence for Trump
Radcliffe have said the same talking
points
we
don&#39;t know what these are
threat to National Security and even we
don&#39;t even know how they&#39;re going faster
than the speed of sound without making a
sonic boom
when of course there have been
classified airspace projects and people
I know who develop those systems decades
ago
now
if in fact
the ranking member of the Senate
intelligence committee doesn&#39;t know that
Salient fact
or heaven forbid the Director of
National Intelligence doesn&#39;t
then that&#39;s a very big problem the only
problem that&#39;s worse is that they do
know that that&#39;s a lie and they are
scripted and they are lying to the
public and to the American people and
it&#39;s appalling it cannot go on because
the reason they would want people to
think this is what&#39;s important this is
the punch line the reason they want
everyone to think we don&#39;t know what
those are or maybe they&#39;re from China or
Russia it&#39;s nonsense
is because if and when they roll out
this last card this hoaxing of an alien
threat this false flag operation the
whole world will be convinced oh we&#39;ve
been told we don&#39;t know what these are
therefore anything that goes bump in the
night or is violent or something
disastrous happens it&#39;s alien
blame it on the aliens because we don&#39;t
have that capability what we are here to
do is to prove in point effect we do
Full Stop in the discussion let&#39;s quit
playing games
because if the public understands
the Technologies the modus operandi
the research and development that has
happened since World War II to now and
that we have these systems and that they
have been in the past and will be in the
future used for counterintelligence and
hoaxing and faking events then if enough
people know that a billion two billion
people know it which is Our intention
with what we&#39;re doing today
then they may not pull that stunt we may
avoid
that last card from being played because
if we don&#39;t you&#39;ve heard what these
generals and others have said what the
consequences are and they are not
overstating the gravity of the situation
at all not in the lease and neither is
Carol rosin so that&#39;s what&#39;s at stake
here
so as we go forward
any and I think you all know
that if you&#39;re following the news
back a few years ago Senator Harry Reid
from Nevada it was the majority leader
of the Senate
um was working on this issue he has been
mentoring Senator Rubio and also works
with uh some other Senators very
interested in this issue they authorized
from the Pentagon budget 22 million
dollars to do a study this is in the New
York Times and CNN on the UFO issue
and I had the opportunity a few months
ago to speak to the general
who actually arranged and set all that
up who had retired from the Pentagon and
was a staffer for Senator Reid and a
friend of Senator Reese
and in this couple hour Zoom call
meeting we had closed in the height of
covet a few months ago
he told me that they authorized this
thinking they were going to get a
legitimate study from Bigelow Aerospace
out of
Nevada
now I&#39;ve known Mr Bigelow since I met
him at the Rockefeller Ranch in 1993.
and he immediately it was clear to me
from what he told me that he intended to
get into the inside of the technology
and knowledge and he&#39;d probably do
anything to do so I&#39;ve met a few
billionaires and sent to millionaires
who have done this because what they
they don&#39;t need the money they want the
access they want the knowledge so his
consigliare
and the people around him who were the
his mentor for him forming Bigelow
Aerospace and before that the National
Institute of Discovery Science were all
Counter Intelligence operations from and
acknowledged special access projects I
knew them I knew every one of them and I
knew he was going to be used by them for
his money and his connections and his
political connections to run what&#39;s
called a DDT operation
do you think of DDT as a pesticide or
whatever
the right-hand guy for the director of
the National Security Agency back some
years ago who was who was General Odom
his assistant used to carry his
briefcase handcuffed you know that whole
bit and I were I was meeting with him
and he says oh yeah we call these DDT
operations I said what is that you&#39;re
poisoning people I said no no no no you
set up a decoy
operation it becomes a distraction and
it trashes people&#39;s money or their
understanding or their influence and
diverts so it&#39;s a diversion
it is in and of itself a
counterintelligence false flag strategy
and that my friends is what happened to
our 22 million dollars your money my
money
I&#39;ve never gotten an Indian head nickel
from the US government but I sure have
or a contractor or anyone I&#39;m sure it
paid a lot
um and that money went right into this
operation which was designed to get a
report back to Congress and this is what
general Herbert said it came back we had
a classified briefing in this skip the
secure communication information
facility that&#39;s what it is I&#39;m going to
use it skip in the future in my
presentation
in the Senate but he said there was
nothing that substantive there was a
view from forty thousand feet he was an
Army pilot this General Herbert I said
yes of course he said what do you mean
of course I said well let me explain to
to you what the DDT operation was that
was run on you and I explained to him
what I just said to you and he went oh
my God I wish we&#39;d known you then
because we just wasted 22 million
dollars I said is that why you didn&#39;t re
knew the grant to Bigelow Aerospace
because you felt and sensed that you
were actually being deceived and it was
a waste of money he says yes we knew we
weren&#39;t getting the story he told me
that point blank
now we have this Director of National
Intelligence report coming out
and what kind of dog and pony show
that&#39;ll be who knows likely in the
classified skiff
for congress they will present some
cases that will all be couched like they
did for President Reagan and others and
president Trump and vice president Pence
that it&#39;s a national security threat
that it&#39;s an alien threat we need more
money for the defense contractors and we
need to have more assets to put weapons
in space to protect us from the aliens
that&#39;s the game that&#39;s being played
right now today
and that&#39;s why we have to act
