As I was running out of air, I could see all the bubbles coming out.  I thought, 'It's over.' After struggling so hard, I relaxed and faced the surface of the water above.  In an instant, I saw my whole life in a very fast and yet very clear fashion. I remember the mostly orange color of this movie.  Then I found myself in pitch darkness, but I was relaxed. Then I felt myself lifted up.  Although nothing touched me, I floated back to the surface.
