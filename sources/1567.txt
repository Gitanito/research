    Summary&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Everyday Astrology.
 1937--1952  Monthly
 New York, NY.  Publisher: N.L. Pines; Better Publications; Pines Publishing Company.
  1/1, May 1937-63/1, November 1952.

 This was an utterly undistinguished mass-market journal that obviously served only to fill out the publisherâ€™s otherwise undistinguished mass-market magazines on topics such as Popular Western, Thrilling Western, Thrilling Love, Thrilling Detective, Popular Detective, Rio Kid, etc.  Its only distinguishing features are its covers and the fact that it managed to last for a decade and a half.
