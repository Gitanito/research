  				DESCRIPTION
  				Ray Carte nearly ends his life when he plummets off an icy   				mountain road and crashes into a tree. Experiencing the near   				death state, he finds himself lost in a strange world in which   				he encounters a guide who reminds him of Alice from Alice in   				Wonderland. His lovely guide turns out to be much more than   				a fairy tale character: only with her help does he maintain hope   				that he can return to those he loves.

  				Readers are transported into the post mortem state in this novel   				of the near death experience. Under the Tree follows in   				the tradition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Death,   				dying and the afterlife are explored from the point of view of   				characters entangled in a life-and-death crisis.

  				Under the Tree was written for readers who enjoy   				philosophy and religion in a dramatic format; Under the Tree  				belongs in the same genre as The Celestine Prophecy.   				Writing with the colors of Buddhist philosophy, Stone presents   				Eastern concepts of the afterlife in an engaging drama that adds   				clarity to the discussion of life after death.

  				This one belongs on your bookshelf next to The Tibetan Book   				of the Dead and Siddhartha.

  				The Buddha achieved enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. Ray   				Carte almost loses his life under the tree, but, with her help,   				finds his way back, having learned lessons that change his life.
  &nbsp;

A   				manual for dying. Don't leave this life without reading Under   				the Tree. The author, who has spent lifetimes studying the   				spiritual, shares his observations in Under the Tree.
