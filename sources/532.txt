 Chimes.
 A Metaphysical and Psychic Magazine / Largest Psychic Monthly.
 1942--1974  Monthly and bimonthly (June-July and November-December)

  This was one of the leading spiritualist journals of the period.  In addition to news of the movement around the United States, the journal contained a Monthly Children's Corner, reprints of material by famous spiritualists of earlier times, like Hudson Tuttle, and regular contributions by Ron Ormond, Marrie S Miller, Enid S. Smith, Ph.D., Sarah Louise Ford, and other now-forgotten mediums and writers.  The journal is most notable today for its extensive lists of mediums and organizations around the United States, listed by area (predominantly in California), and for its advertisements and notices from the myriad spiritualist and occult practitioners of the period, e.g., Thomas C. Kelly, "Healing Medium for People, Animal Pets and Birds," "Grace Strickland, "Healer with X-Ray Vision," "Modern Loaves and Fishes, actual scientific experiments in food multiplications," Premier College of Technical Metphysics, Ltd. --"There are No Incurable Diseases" -- etc., and for the forgotten paraphernalia that accompanied their work ("!!!Mystic Lightning !!!  At Last!  Lift your Vibrations thru the scented, mystical atmosphere of RAINBOW LITE."  The journal was merged with the Psychic Observer in 1974 to form Psychic Observer and Chimes.
