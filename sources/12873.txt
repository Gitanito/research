  		              		Experience Description   

    It was awful when I got out of surgery. It hurt so badly.  The doctor released me from the hospital to  go home.  It turns out that they cut my throat from the inside, and that night I bled out.  I woke in a puddle of blood, too weak to move my head out of the blood.  My grandfather, my champion, lifted me up while my grandmother cleaned me up and dressed me. We went back to the hospital. I was put in an old-fashion white night gown.  
  
  The ride to the hospital was 138 miles of hellish and winding country highways. Every turn felt like 10 tons was slamming into my limp body.  I remember getting put on a gurney and watching the tube lights flash by.  I know that the nurses tried to take my blood pressure, but I didn't have any. It hurt so badly for the nurses and the doctor to be touching me.  I screamed and that was that.  I heard the doctor tell my Grandfather, 'I am sorry, we've lost her. She's gone.'
  
   The pain was gone and I was swimming in  plasma love light  real,  so intense, and so LOVING.  
  
  My Grandfather was leaning over my body praying to the great spirit for my 'LIFE.'  I was more alive when dead than I had ever been alive in that small weak, sickly suit, they call a body.  The Plasma Love Light Being-beings showed me my grandfather praying over my body and asked me if I wanted to go back to him because I loved him so much.  My answer was that he'd be with me soon anyways and I tried to go back to playing. 

  I saw my body. It was as if I had taken off a dirty set of clothing. The body  was lying there, but it was NOT me. It was just the suit I'd been wearing and it wasn't especially a nice suit as it was always sick.    I was back to the area I will call the center of the Milky Way playing in the black hole in the center.  It is a very tiny galaxy, in a very small solar system traveling around the black hole of the galaxy.  I knew it wasn't even the size of a grain of sand while I was there.  It was so tiny. I liked the colors and the freedom of movement I had, without pain and without getting water up my nose.  The love there was so intense.  I never wanted to leave. 

  The plasma Love Light angels, grabbed my love-light soul and hauled me away by force to my dead body. I watched the creator, blow the breath of life back into my body.  I told the angels I didn't want to go back into that body because it 'HURT' too much.  We communicated  telepathically. I asked them why they would do that to me.  They said, like a voice at a stadium, 'We are sorry, but you haven't finished your job.' They granted the wish that I wouldn't be in pain when I woke. 

  I found my grandfather  leaning on my body crying and praying with the two morgue attendants on either end of the gurney.  The sheet was still over my head. The doctor had placed a sheet on me and folded my arms over me  in a dead fashion.  Press a corpse a certain way and it crosses their arms.  I am guessing the doctor did that to verify I was dead. 

  I sat up and the sheet fell off. My grandfather started shaking me.  I told him, 'Get off me you big ooof, you weight a ton.'  I slipped into unconsciousness at that moment and woke much later to see my grandfather  beside my bed.  I was being given blood from strangers.      					  

    

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1970  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes    Surgery-related. While under general anesthesia.    I had my tonsils removed but because under anesthesia and suffering from extreme blood loss.  I was pronounced dead, the sheet pulled over my head.   I was 7 years old and I was always a very sick child, so having my tonsils removed was just a thing to help me stay out of the hospital.  I was very ill, as normally in winter. 

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

The experience included:      Out of body experience  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes.  I saw my grandfather leaning over my body and he was crying for me.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   Everything was more real with colors more vivid than can be seen with a human eye. I had freedom of movement to go from one place to the next by just thinking about it. There was a great love light surrounding me and I was part of it.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         The moment before the plasma love light Beings made me aware of my grandfather, until I was reattached to my body.  I had super-vision, super knowledge, super loving. I had  no hunger, thirst or desires for anything as my plasma love light soul needed nothing that my body did.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     Time had no meaning. I traveled across the Milky Way in the blink of a thought.  I didn't know what it looked like until I saw pictures of it in the 1990's. I realized that is where I was from that picture of our Milky Way.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       My ability to see everything was so wonderful and the plasma love light was in everything; it is what holds the partials together. Science confirms that they don't know why  parts hold together on a sub-atomic level.  

  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      I heard the sound of the Milky Way. It was singing its joy to love.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, and the facts have been checked out  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain.     I do not remember a  tunnel.  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

The experience included:       Unearthly light  

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an Unearthly light?         Yes   It was Plasma Love Light.  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     I believe I was in the black hole of the Milky Way.  It was so light there.  

  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         The greatest; love, joy, peace, warmth, forgiveness, and understanding and I was part of it.  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

The experience included:       Special knowledge or purpose  

  Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe.     Honestly, I didn't want to go back into the 'LIMITING' body because it is unable to handle the knowledge I had while 'dead'.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No       

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will    

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What importance did you place on your religious/spiritual life prior to your experience?         Unknown  

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other or several faiths.   I am part American Indian and I met the great spirit  

  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     I won't ever set foot into a church ever again. It is too fake for me.  

What importance do you place on your religious/spiritual life after your experience?         Greatly important to me  

  What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths.   I believe in the plasma love light,  the creator; not any other religion but all religions that speak of love.  

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     My grandmother had OBEs all the time.  She wore a girdle and all you had to do was upset her and she'd take a deep breath and out she'd go. She told me of meeting Jesus and all her family that passed before her and a pearly gate. There was NONE of that in my experience.  

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Before, gold was of high value; money, things, homes, and possessions. Now, it is how many lives have I saved, how many people have I taught to love in the most impossible circumstances. Life is something you can't buy. No matter how much gold you have, you can't buy more love or more life.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I met a plasma love light, which may have been many Beings or simply a very large Being that spoke with the sound of many voices at the same time. It was like being in a stadium with an announcer.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

  During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     I have lived MANY lives. The message I got about this lifetime is that I am an ascended master and that I came back to love. I was sent back to do a 'job' which implies I am not working for me.  As far as having been, memories are triggered when I come in contact with people who I've had prior contact with in past lifetimes in this lifetime.  There are exceptions as I hate to be drugged, it eliminates my free will, and I hate to be told what my life is to be like.  I love free will. I love life.    The other thing I got from this that should be mentioned is that I was more alive when dead than I am in body.  I went around pinching people trying to wake them up after my NDE. I have brain damage from the NDE also, so I think I was gone for a while out of body.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     We are all plasma love light. This life is NOT real; it's a hologram and we accept the confines of the hologram so we can experience EVERYTHING.  To be without body means you have no desires, no wants and no needs, and therefore have no understanding of 'Hate, Hot, Cold, Hunger, love, smell, hurt, pain, or even emotions' about things. To be in body means you get to feel like it is all real and that the consequences of not caring for the body is death.  

Did you believe in the existence of God prior to your experience?         Unknown  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes.     It is love, that is the only answer.  Everything that isn't love isn't creating but destroying.      

Do you believe in the existence of God after your experience?         God definitely exists  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

  During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   My job is to teach love, even in hard to understand ways.  It is NOT loving to let your child or government get out of hand.  Teaching your child or your government right is wrong is loving. This hands-off upbringing where you don't even steer the ship, thereby  running into people and pollute the world is not loving and it destroys life. We are all like ships and growing gardens.  Either we decide our fate or we run amuck.  

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Are not meaningful and significant  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     Man can create beautiful dead-stuff, it is of no value.  You can't take that fancy suit with you, you can't give your future-self all the knowledge and wealth you accumulated in this lifetime to your future lifetime.   The question I ask many people as I teach Plasma Love Light classes, is 'will this matter in your next lifetime?' If it is loving, it will, if it is destruction, we get to do this again until we figure it out. Heaven is here on earth but so is hell.  

Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?         An afterlife definitely exists  

  Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?         An afterlife definitely exists.     Yes     Being raised Cherokee, it was always a given that we existed before.  This isn't a surprise at all to me.  I was a scribe Priest for the church in around 400 AD, and I died of prostate disease, of which I can still smell when I focus on it. I remember many of my traumatic deaths from before this lifetime. I have always been trying to be closer to God.  I was given that chance and the creator sent me back on a mission.  

Did you fear death prior to your experience?         I greatly feared death  

Do you fear death after your experience?         I do not fear death  

Were you fearful living your life prior to your experience?         Unknown  

Were you fearful living your life after your experience?         Not fearful in living my earthly life  

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Are not meaningful and significant  

Did you believe that our earthly lives are meaningful and significant after your experience?         Are meaningful and significant  

  Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes.     You break it, you fix it.  We caused the problem by not controlling the government then  are responsible to love them, even if it means punishing them.  Death is not permanent but we have to work towards gaining knowledge and connections again.  It is like going from farm to farm and having to return it to usefulness and then moving on once it is up and running again.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     That I can do this and I am no one special.  I have a sickly body because almost all great masters have that. Einstein was dyslexic, Tesla was a sickly child, and Newton was very sick most of his life. 

Were you compassionate prior to your experience?         Not compassionate toward others  

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I am to teach love.  I go to court with families who are being torn apart and  afraid.  I  have no fear, as the worst thing to happen to me is that I died, which is also the best thing to happen to me.  I got to go home to the plasma light Beings and tell them all about what love, hate, joy, hungry, happy are like. It's about the experience.  

Were you compassionate after your experience?         Greatly compassionate toward others  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life.     I spent time in my family unit being very Christian.  In 2002, my husband admitted to molesting my two oldest children and I went into shock.  I found I had these memories and that I had always had them but my meaning of why I was alive had really vanished.  Because of the NDE, I have been able to help many people who also lost the meaning of life to live. To love even though it is tough, to remember why we are here, to experience everything. It is awesome to feel true power and love.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes. It is harder to get me to anger when I know this is not real.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   The love is indiscernible; as is the colors, beauty and sound without this meat-suit.  

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  It was totally more vivid than my current lifetime.  I can't tell you what I had for breakfast today, but I can tell you exactly what happened while I was dead. I can tell you how wonderful it was and how unhappy I was to find myself locked back into the body against my will.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     My intuition is very strong and I seem to know when to do things, even buy food for strangers who I didn't know were in need.  I feel a push in my ribs to do something and if I don't do it, I feel I have let down the creator when I see the poor person I was to help.  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          There are four questions of value in life...   What is sacred?   Of what is the spirit made?   What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for?   The answer to each is the same. Only love. [from Don Juan DeMarco (1994)]  Johnny Depp.  This sums up it well.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    The Cheyenne freaked out, they were not ok with it.   My grandfather spoke quietly to me about it and told me NOT to share it or I would end up in a straight-jacket. I know it freaked him out, both me rising from the dead under that sheet and that he could 'lose' me again. He didn't like being pinched either.   There was a movie called 'Is heaven real' that allowed me to open up about my experience. Until  that moment, I really was afraid to tell people.    

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It was so real, I kept pinching people to 'wake them up.'  This life is NOT real, it is just that the dreamer hasn't awaken. Life is but a dream. Row Row Row your boat, is the one song I can sing note perfect because it has so much meaning to me.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     More real, and it still is.  I knew that this life was like I was dreaming when I was having my NDE.  

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   I was the court-watcher and I helped many people with the corruption in the fake courts.  I am no longer teaching that but teaching love and breathing love.  I am  showing people how to heal with or without my help.
