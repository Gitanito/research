 This was an occult journal with a decided literary bent.  In the initial issue, the editor described the journal's hopeful purpose: "Everything fits today in the vast plan that will serve as a guide to the century to synthesize the work of the human spirit. . . .  The process of the past has been reopened and there is a true desire to unravel the secret that the tombs and monuments of the past time contain. The legend ceases to be a poetic matter and the hidden meaning of the myth is sought for the cosmogonic or psychological law that is the fruit of past experience."  It contained contributions by or excerpts from Mario Roso de Luna (on whom see the note under Hesperia), Arthur Conan Doyle, Edouard Schure, Rudolf Steiner, Pierre Piobb, Maurice Maeterlink, and others.
