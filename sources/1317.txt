TELEPATHY AND CLAIRVOYANCE RECONSIDERED 1
By J. B. Rhine
ABSTRACT: ESP is generally considered to consist of telepathy and clair-
voyance, either of which may be precognitive. ESP and precognition are re-
garded as established capacities. But it is submitted here that we have no
clear proof that a truly telepathic form of ESP ever occurs. It is even hard to
design a sure test for true telepathy. Precognitive clairvoyance can account
for all the " evidence " on record for telepathy. On the other hand, there is
evidence of true clairvoyance that cannot be explained byprecognitive telepathy,
and there are methods available for testing true clairvoyance further. These
considerations have far-reaching significance, even on the survival hypothesis.
They do not in any way alter the case for ESP, but they zvill have much to do
mth its explanation. —Ed. Jour. Parapsychol.
When a subject succeeds to a significant degree in identifying objects,
such as the cards in a shuffled deck, by some extra-sensorial means, we
commonly call the performance clairvoyance, or the extra-sensory percep-
tion of objects. If there is similar success in identifying the order of sym-
bols being thought of by a sender, but with no objective target such as a
card, we speak of telepathy. If both the card and the sender's thought are
possible targets for the subject's extra-sensory perception, the test is one of
undifferentiated or general extra- sensory perception (GESP).
But there has long been a fairly common question asked concerning
clairvoyance : Do we need the hypothesis of clairvoyance to account for
the results of clairvoyance tests? Can we not suppose that telepathy
jxplains the results even when there is no sender looking at the cards,
since the experimenter zvill look at them at the time of checking up.? In
v'levi of the considerable evidence of precognition now published, it has
aecome all the easier to suppose that precognitive telepathy can explain
:he card-calling test results commonly ascribed to clairvoyance.
As a matter of fact, we can easily turn the tables by asking whether we
leed the hypothesis of telepathy to account for the results of telepathy
:ests—whether the evidence for that phenomenon cannot be equally well
iccounted for by precognitive clairvoyance. Is it not possible that the

subject simply goes ahead in time by clairvoyance to the point when the'
sender records what he has just been thinking? Thus he would not need
to use telepathy at all but would rely on clairvoyance-plus-precognition. !
[Rhine goes on to say that, in his experience, most people have a distinct'
bias towards telepathy as against clairvoyance, which he thinks is because
it is easier to draw an analogy between telepathy and physical effects such
as radio and the electrical vibrations from the brain.]
Yet in plain truth we must all concede at the outset that we have no
scientific justification for any bias one way or the other. We are as
ignorant of hozv to explain telepathy as we are of how to explain clairvoyance
—no more and no less—and we cannot compare two " ignorances."
Requirements for Proof of Telepathy
To show evidence of telepathy (and exclude clairvoyance) a subject
would have to do significant scoring in tests in which he tried to identify
the thoughts of a sender extra-sensorially when those thoughts had no
objective record anywhere at any time. The sender could not even write
down his thought later, for then it would be available to precognitive clair-
voyance. All the sender could do within the limits allowed him would be
to count mere hits and misses as such without any record being made of
the symbols or target objects of which he was thinking.
Thus the entire accuracy of the true telepathy test depends upon the
unrecorded personal judgments of the sender, and the room for error is
accordingly greater than most critical readers will tolerate. It is true that
the danger of error can be somewhat reduced by the use of a code, known
only to the sender, and of some device, such as a list of random numbers
to determine the selection of the target or symbol to be " sent ". But this
would call for an objective expression, either orally or in writing, of the
code to be used by the sender, which would violate the conditions required
for pure telepathy.
It seems very doubtful if any test for pure telepathy has ever been con
ducted. There were a number of " pure telepathy " experiments conducted
at this laboratory in the early 'thirties in which the sender recorded his
thoughts (one of five symbols) only after the time had passed for the subject
to record his call. But in our more critical frame of mind to-day, we see
clearly that precognitive clairvoyance was a distinct possibility in that par-
ticular test situation and that our term " pure telepathy " was little more
than a mark of the degree to which we were influenced by existing concepts.
Soal and Goldney (5), reached the conclusion that precognitive telepathy
was demonstrated. They believe that clairvoyance was ruled out by the
fact that the subject did not score significantly when the sender did not
look at the symbols during the run, and by the further fact that only certain
persons could successfully act as senders. These facts may be regarded as
suggestive in their bearing; but obviously they cannot be taken as conclu-
sive, since we know now that the subject's attitude or belief is a very great
factor in determining success and failure. The recent report of Schmeidler
(4) gives fresh evidence that this is true. The mere fact that their subject
believed his ability was telepathy could have inhibited his success (which
might well have been due to precognitive clairvoyance) whenever the con-
ditions did not conform to his beliefs or preferences. It is true that he
172] Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered 3
failed in clairvoyance tests and succeeded in tests allowing for telepathy
with a successful sender, even when he was not told which of the two con-
ditions would be imposed at a particular time. But if ESP is a part of his
equipment, it cannot safely be concluded that the subject was wholly
ignorant as to which of these two alternating conditions prevailed. That
would be to ignore the principle we are testing.
In the light of the present reshuffle of values, there is a temptation to
turn for evidence of telepathy to the reports of spontaneous parapsychical
experiences—for example, instances of similar dreams. But this evidence
could hardly be conclusive since the experience is necessarily objectified
in the telling and precognitive clairvoyance (or clairaudience) is a possi-
bility in all such cases.
One thing is clear : If we are to bring the telepathy hypothesis to crucial
test, new experiments will have to be designed and conducted. Until then
telepathy can be regarded only as an unestablished hypothesis having some
favouring evidence, none of which is conclusive.
Requirements for Proof of Clairvoyance
Something of a contrast is presented by the analysis of the case for clair-
voyance. The requirements for such a test can be put very simply : If a
subject significantly identifies cards extra-sensorially when no one knows
the order at the time the test is made and no record of that order is taken,
then no opportunity is provided for precognitive telepathy, and the test is
one of true clairvoyance.
The first point to make is that our earlier tests were " purer " than we
realised when they were being conducted. While no thought was being
given to precognitive telepathy at the time, and we were alert only to the
exclusion of telepathy of the present, some of the conditions approximated
the requirements. The various card-matching techniques probably fall
within the limits of acceptable clairvoyance tests, and there was a great
deal of this matching work done. [Here Rhine describes, inter alia, the
Screened-Touch-Matching experiments of Pratt and Woodruff {2). These
were on the same lines as the Chutes series described next.]
The matching test which was probably most conclusive in its bearing
on the clairvoyance hypothesis is the Chutes Series of Humphrey and
Pratt (i). In this work the subject dropped cards, each enclosed in a
« sealed, opaque envelope, down appropriate chutes instead of piling them
up opposite the key cards. As the envelopes dropped into the compart-
ments in the next room, they were invisible to the subject and unobserved
by the experimenters, who were occupied. The cards did not fall in orderly
piles, and their sequence was often not preserved. The experimenters made
no effort to keep the cards in the order in which they fell; they merely sorted
as
3ut the hits, counted them, and dropped all the cards back in the compart-
ment. Thus the memory-plus-precognitive-telepathy hypothesis hardly
seems applicable here, although there is perhaps still a technical possibility.
A second type of evidence of clairvoyance may be found in the significant
;ct|
results of the ESP-shuffle experiments (3). "in these tests the subject
ck shuffled a deck of cards a given number of times (or a given number of
n- seconds), aiming to make it match as fully as possible another similar deck
>r a list of symbols concealed from the subject's view. The important
4 ' J.B. Rhine [Part
operation was the shufRe (actually the last shuffle since that usually changes
the entire order) and, of course, the ESP capacity guiding it. In placing a
batch of cards in a certain position the subject was " calling " them to
match the cards in the corresponding positions in the other deck. To
place them intelligently (as against chance) requires some kind and degree
of knowledge of present arrangement before the shuffle is made. But this
knowledge cannot be drawn from the subsequent check-up by precogni-
tion-plus-telepathy because once the shuffle is made the present order of
the cards is destroyed and they will not then be in that order when the check-up
is made. Thus it is not possible to explain the ESP-shuffle results as due
to the subjects precognitive telepathy of the experimenter's thoughts as
he records the shuffled deck.
[This argument is expanded in the original paper.]
But even if we assume precognitive telepathy of the hidden deck and
assume that the subject gets a glimpse of a card (or several cards, altogether,
in the various shuffles) as he handles the deck he is shuffling, we have to
go on to explain how he can place the card accurately in the right position
by shuffling. He is merely taking an ESP test, unconcerned as to whether
it is clairvoyance or telepathy. We can hardly suppose that without clair-
voyance of the deck he holds he would know where and how to place the
card which we assume he saw ^o as to match the one which we assume he
perceived by precognitive telepathy.
Thus while the ESP-shuffle experiment does not offer an undebatable
case for true clairvoyance, it does, to my judgment at least, represent a
highly plausible one. With the addition of screening of the deck that is
being shuffled from all possible sensory cues, this research method would
be quite satisfactory.
Tyrrell's electrically operated ESP test machine (6) appears to meet the
requirements for a pure clairvoyance test. His machine has five small
boxes, any one of which may be lit by a small electric bulb. The box to
be lit is selected by a complex mechanical device. The subject is instructed
to choose one of the five boxes, trying to hit the lighted one. If he does, a
hit is automatically recorded. In any case a record of the trial is automati-
cally made. Now if there is only the record of trials and hits without a
record of which box is selected, there is no future observation by anyone to
which the subject may go forward precognitively for information as to
which box to open. Precognitive telepathy is thus not a possibility. The
subject himself, when he opens one of the boxes as his way of indicating
his choice, sees the light at once if he is right, and thus knows which box
was the target for that trial. And if he is wrong, he discovers that fact too.
But since he has first to make his choice before he could possibly predict its
outcome, the knowledge of the success or failure of the choice could not
guide the choice—that is, as far as can be seen on the basis of present
knowledge. Tyrrell's significant results, then, reported for these conditions
may be safely regarded as evidence of true clairvoyance.
Other and even simpler machines for testing clairvoyance are now either
under construction or have been recently brought into use here and in
England (7). These types of apparatus allow the subject to try to identify
a coloured disc or marble by pressing a lever and dropping the marble into
a compartment which automatically registers the subject's impression as
172] Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered 5
^ to the colour. In the end, the check-up is made by counting the number
'
of objects of the right colour in the five compartments. The order is lost
track of completely, provided the machine is closed in and the marbles are
" invisible until the time of checking up, and hence any kind of precognition
* or precognitive telepathy is excluded.
Curiously enough, by far the most extensive (if somewhat indirect)
evidence of true clairvoyance—evidence in which there is no suggestion of
'/ telepathy or precognitive telepathy—comes from, the researches on PK,
or the psychokinetic effect. In the PK tests thus far reported, a subject has
" endeavoured to influence the falling of dice by direct mental action,
willing a specified face or combination of faces to turn up.
No one as yet pretends to understand the working of the PK effect, but
as soon as one becomes aware of the occurrence of this phenomenon, one
^ thing is fairly obvious to him : In order to succeed, the PK process has to
^1
be guided by some orienting, directing influence—some cognition of the point
" in the space-time continuum at which the die is located at a given instant,
" some way of knowing v/hich face is up, and other details. Knowledge of
the rolling die seems absolutely necessary to allow purposive action upon
'
it. Now this knowledge has to be gained extra-sensorially because visual
* perception is much too slow to follow dice which are rolling and bounding
against padded tables or down through w^ire cages. With larger numbers
of dice—published experiments report up to 24, 60, and 96 per throw
—
the inadequacy of sensory perception is still more apparent. And the type
' of ESP that is required here is pure clairvoyance ;
precognitive telepathy
'5
could not fill the need.
^ Thus the case for clairvoyance is found to have a firm foundation in the
PK work, and what is probably a firm one in the matching studies and the
" ESP-shuffle experiments. The total evidence is sufficient to raise clair-
" voyance out of the realm of unestablished hypotheses where we must, for
^
the present at least, leave telepathy.
J
General Bearing of the Conclusions
' One thing should be made plain to everyone : The total effective evidence
" for ESP is not affected by this discussion. The issue is entirely an internal
" affair. [Here Rhine discusses the significance to parapsychology of his
" re-appraisal of telepathy and clairvoyance, and refers again to the general
'6
difficulty in the acceptance of clai'rvoyance as compared to telepathy.]
I?
What specific difference does it make whether ESP is all clairvoyance,
all telepathy, or partly both.? What real change in the interpretation and
bearing of ESP does the shift of telepathy from a preferred to a lower and
doubtful status make Wherein does it matter that we shall now have to
take clairvoyance with full seriousness and, at least for the present, con-
it
sider it as the one form of ESP fully established
'S
The most immediate consequence is that we must face in earnest the
fact \hzt psychophysical interaction ofperceptual character may occur without
the known intermediating organs of the senses. This joint function between
Ji
mental and material systems resulting in cognition may no longer be
y dodged by speculative recourse to the telepathy interpretation. This
" relation is the counterpart of the interaction between the psychical and
^ physical involved in the PK effect.
6 J. B. Rhine [Part 1/
The drastic shifts in point of view which are called for in this reconsider- .
as
ation of the facts about telepathy and clairvoyance induce another sobering If,
thought : May there not be other claims of parapsychical abilities that aW
need to be given the same kind of re-appraisal ? What other concepts, '
n
similar to telepathy and clairvoyance, are we using in ways which cannot iai
be justified when we subject them to critical analysis ? Already in the o
course of the discussion of telepathy and clairvoyance the concept of pre-
cognition has met with some new problems.
The Hypotheses of Telepathy and Survival
The telepathy hypothesis has been regarded as one of the main counter- pla
hypotheses to that of survival in explaining the mediumistic utterances k
that have been among the primary data bearing on the issue of personal i eve
survival.
For the present it would be wishful thinking to apply the telepathy ,
hypothesis as a counter-argument against the survival hypothesis while
''
there is no clear evidential case for the occurrence of telepathy. Only if
telepathy is reliably known to function as a human ability can we properly
^'
suppose the medium is using such a parapsychical capacity in acquiring her
knozvledge. In many instances it may make little real difference about 3'
telepathy if the medium is to be credited with unlimited clairvoyance
(including precognitive clairvoyance), but it would be logically possible to
have cases occurring in mediumistic practice in which only telepathy "t'
could serve as an alternative to survival (for example, cases in which only
the sitters' notation of " right " or " wrong ", entered on a stenographic 5'
record, registers the fact that the mediumistic utterances seem to reflect
thoughts which could have originated only with the sitter or the purported
communicator). There can be no objective confirmation for such in-
stances, but at least there can be unlimited multiplication of instances.
Another close association between the telepathy and the survival
hypotheses is indicated in the familiar suggestion that if there is spirit
communication it is telepathy between the living and the dead. The sup-
position is that the medium acquires her " messages " through telepathy!
with the minds of the deceased personalities purporting to communicate, i
In related fashion the hypothesis is extended to cover the explanation ofr.
communication between spirit personalities. According to the speculation |
of the spiritist, thought-transference from mind to mind is not possible
on a sensory, mechanical basis since the spirits are incorporeal. Tele-
pathy is the only means of inter-communication possible. According to
this line of thought, then, telepathy is essential, not only to the communi- \
cation of the spirits with the living, but to their intercommunication among
themselves. In this suppositional instance precognitive clairvoyance could
not substitute in any way for the role attributed to telepathy. The question-
of the occurrence of telepathy thus becomes of very great importance to the ;
investigation of the spirit hypothesis. ;
Prospect for Telepathy Research
If these reflections on telepathy are sound, we may perhaps rightly hope
for a strongly renewed interest in telepathy research. One of the goals
would be to settle once and for all the status of the telepathic hypothesis
172] Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered 7
as a coiinterhypothesis in the investigation of the question of survival.
If, as so many people have long believed, telepathy does occur, it is reason-
able to hope it will meet the new experimental demands that have to be
made and will eventually be firmly estabhshed. As a matter of fact, I
have a degree of the same personal bias toward telepathy that most students
'of parapsychology seem to have. But the situation must be franklv faced :
there is at the mom.ent no adequately reliable case for telepathy. If a
correct approach is made to the problem, and if telepathy occurs, the evi-
dence will presumably come in time. If it does not, new insights and
adjustments will be in order. Whatever is disco^-ered, it will help to ex-
plain the nature of ESP, and its discovery will almost certainly improve
the reach of the human mind in its effort at self-understanding and the
eventual control of its world.

COMMENTS ON DR RHINE'S
" TELEPATHY AND CLAIRVOYANCE RECONSIDERED "
I. By W. Whately Carington
With Dr Rhine's general approach I could hardly be more heartily in
accord. Nothing is more salutary than radically to challenge views that
are usually taken for granted ; and valuable results may often be obtained
by seeing what happens when we turn them inside out. In particular, few
things would please me more than to be forced to the conclusion that it is
inherently impossible to distinguish experimentally between the so-called
" telepathic " and " clairvoyant " explanations of paracognitive pheno-
mena. We should then have to admit that the alleged distinction is strictly
meaningless, and that the supposed alternative hypotheses were no more
than alternative linguistic ways of describing the same events. If we were
then to cast out, as necessarily meaningless, the terms on which the
apparent distinction depends, we should, I think, find that we had made
an important step forward in our understanding of the relation between
what we call " mind " and what we call " matter ".
As I shall explain below, 1 fancy that something very like this conclusion
will, in fact, be forced upon us, though the argument will not follow pre-
cisely the course just indicated, or the line taken by Dr Rhine.
My immediate reaction to t'ne content of Dr Rhine's remarks was one of
strong dissent ; but I suspect that this was mainly a matter of prejudice,
due to my having thought so long about, and in terms of, telepathy and to
having (as I believe) produced a not implausible theory of its mechanism.
I now think that 1 was probably wrong in this, and am provisionally pre-
pared to go even further in certain directions than Dr Rhine does, though
I cannot assent to his basic view (as I understand it) that clairvoyance is a
process radically different from telepathy and alternative to it.
It seems fairly clear to me that, once we concede the claims of clair-
voyance as ordinarily understood, we can never formally demonstrate
" pure " telepathy, though the difficulties are not, I think, quite those
envisaged by Dr Rhine. I see no sort of objection in principle, though
there would be a few technical problems to be solved in practice, to the
type of experiment he mentions, in which the experimenter merely images
or " thinks of " a succession of card symbols, say, and records no more
than whether the subject's guess was right or wrong. It is true that we
should have to rely exclusively on the experimenter's statements, but I do
not think that any one who is prepared to accept paranormal cognition in
any form would cavil seriously over this.
The trouble is rather that the proponents of clairvoyance would be, so
far as I can see, perfectly entitled to claim that any process of imaging,
etc., by the agent is bound to be accompanied by corresponding and pre-
sumably characteristic changes in the brain, or perhaps by innervations
of speech mechanisms, eye movements, etc., of subliminal intensity, and
that these may be clairvoyantly cognised. Against this line of argument no
experiment that could possibly be conducted by incarnate man could be
S
[Part 172] Comments on Dr Rhine's " Telepathy ", etc. 9
proof. I agree that such an hypothesis would be extremely far-fetched,
not to say fantastic, and I do not believe a word of it ; but it does not seem
to me more fantastic than the kind of thing we are implicitly asked to
accept in connection with clairvoyance of more ordinary type, assuming
that the evidence is strong enough (as it probably is) to warrant us accept-
ing this at all.
In the " chutes " experiment, for example, and mutatis mutandis for
others, we are required to believe that the subject identifies a black symbol
on a white card when that card is in the dark. But to say " such and such
a card, now in the dark, is now white " is absurd, because " white " can
only mean " reflecting light of all frequencies ", whereas ex hypothesi
there is no light to reflect. And the same, of course, for coloured counters,
etc.
The clairvoyantist must therefore fall back on some story to the effect
that it is the " inner nature " of the pigment or the like that is cognised.
But the words " inner nature ", if held to refer to something that is
essentially unobservable, yet in some way responsible for the observable
properties of an object, etc., means exactly nothing at all ; for no con-
ceivable process can distinguish between the hypothesis that an object
consists of properties plus an inner nature, and the hypothesis that it con-
sists only of properties.
So far as this is concerned, I should, and do, remain an unrepentant
telepathist, on the ground that although I cannot devise an experiment
formally to exclude the clairvoyant alternative, I am not called upon to
exclude alternatives that mean nothing.
But although I should like to see much more and more direct evidence
in favour of pure clairvoyance than has yet been adduced—in particular
strong positive results from Mr Parsons' machine or some close equivalent
—I think we must even now cater for the probability of its being ^ fact in
nature. But in doing so we must strenuously refuse to fob ourselves off
with pseudo-explanations based on the use of such logically meaningless
terms as " inner nature ", " essential quiddity " or the like.
The only way out of the tangle that I can see is to say firmly that a thing
is the totality of the observations that can be made upon it, and nothing
more ; more accurately, perhaps, that it is a certain sequential pattern of
sensa (or sense-data, sensibilia, cognita, or like terms). This does away
with all meaningless non-sense about " direct awareness of its inner
nature ", but it involves divesting our irreducible " sensa " of any ex-
clusively sensational (physiologically speaking) connotations.
It also inwlves the more revolutionary notion that a red sensum, say,
(I should prefer to call it simply a cognisable), exists even when, as we
would ordinarily put it, the object to which it belongs is in the dark ; but
this appears much less objectionable than at first sight when we reflect that
we can easily enough retain or recall a red image when the so-called
" object " is darkened.
The real key to the difficulty seems to me to lie in the meaning to be
attached to the word " exists ". So far as I can see no meaning whatever
can be assigned to the proposition " X exists now, although no-one is
cognising it (or can observe it) " except by making it identically equivalent
to the proposition " X will be cognised (or observed) under such and such
lo W. Whately Caringlon [Part
conditions ". The notion that the continued existence of X, not at the
moment cognised, impHes that X is lurliing somewhere behind the scenes
waiting to take its cue and come on the stage again, is natural enough, hut
non-sensical, because it could only be verified by observing {i.e., cognising)
X in its hiding place.
To bring telepathy and clairvoyance into line, then, I think that we must
first eject with ineluctable finality our old but tiresome friend the thing-
in-itself, Ding-an-sich (or Ding, as we might call it for short). We must say
that what we commonly call a material object is no more and no less than a
certain sequentially patterned aggregate of cognisables, the individual
existences of which do not depend on their being actually arranged in that
pattern at any particular moment (or something very like this—no doubt
the wording could be improved). Various circumstances may lead (I
speak somewhat colloquially) to their being brought into certain relations
with other groups of cognisables forming what would usually be called
mental contents or the like (but, according to me, just minds or sub-
systems thereof), and they are then said to be cognised by those minds.
They are then, of course, if not before, subject to associative processes,
etc. If the cognitive relation is brought about by associative mechanisms
involving another mind or minds, we call it telepathy ; if it is direct, and
does not involve anything that would ordinarily be called another mind,
then we call it clairvoyance.
Thus it would be fundamentally waste of time, I submit, to wrangle
whether telepathy is explicable in terms of clairvoyance, or clairvoyance
in terms of telepathy. Such disputations can arise only from the tacit or
explicit postulation of logical monstrosities such as Egos and Dings. I
think that if we stick resolutely to what alone we know, namely ordered
sequences of cognised cognisables, if I may so put it, we shall find that
telepathy and clairvoyance are not mutually exclusive alternatives, or even
rival hypotheses, but only closely related varieties of the same fundamental
process.
I need hardly say that the foregoing remarks are to be taken as highly
tentative ;
but I feel it would be a pity to squander our energies on un-
profitable controversy, and I believe that what I have said indicates ap-
proximately the lines along which we may most advantageously try to
develop our thinking on these topics.
THE LOCUS STANDI OF TELEPATHY
H. By J. Hettinger
Having no personal experience of the various methods used in the card-
guessing and dice-rolling experiments, I lack the necessary background for
expressing an opinion as to whether the conditions of clairvoyance or of
telepathy were present in the specific series carried out by Dr Rhine and
others. For the same reason, 1 am unable to pass any comments on the
issue : precognitive clairvoyance versus precognitive telepathy. However,
172] Comments on Dr. Rhine's " Telepathy ", etc. 11
in view of Dr Rhine's reconsidered opinion, that clairvoyance is now an
" estabhshed " and telepathy still an " unestablished " hypothesis, I feel
that the assertion ought not to be left unchallenged.
Psychic experiences often referred to as " clairvoyant " and " telepathic"
have been known long before the present experimental stage. Many of
them have been carefully investigated by the S.P.R. and the American
S.P.R., and they carry a certain amount of conviction, which, in my
opinion, compares favourably with the conviction which the significant
results of statistical tests are supposed to lead to. Although I mj^self am a
protagonist of statistics whenever they can be easily applied and readily
understood by others, I feel certain that an abundant collection of striking
experiences and striking results of qualitative experiments tends to carry
greater conviction than the results of mathematical calculations. I am
mentioning this, because of Dr Rhine's statement :
" To show evidence of
telepathy (and exclude clairvoyance) a subject would have to do significant
scoring . .
.". Significant scoring is not the only evidence in science ;
moreover, based, as it is, on " hits " and " misses ", it does not diff'er-
entiate among the individual successes, which of them are due to chance
coincidence and which to a transcendental faculty.
As I assume, and hope, that others will take up the challenge by dealing
with the evidence provided by the collection of the spontaneous cases of a
telepathic character, I will confine the evidence I wish to bring forth in
support of telepathy to some of the instances reported in the two volumes^
of my experimental work on psychometry, carried out at King's College,
London University. Before doing so, however, I submit that the defini-
tions of " clairvoyance " and " telepathy " given by Dr Rhine require to
be slightly amended for the sake of greater precision and accuracy. They
ought to read as follows : When a percipient succeeds in identifying
objects by means transcending ordinary sensory and intellectual percep-
tion, and those objects are not known to any mind, we commonly call the
performance clairvoyance. If there is similar success with respect, not to a
concrete object, symbols and illustrations included, but to the mental, viz.
psychological, make-up of a person, the subconscious included, we speak of
telepathy. If both the object and the mind are possible targets, we are
unable to differentiate whether the interrelation between the percipient
and that which is perceived is one of clairvoyance or telepathy.
The experiments described in the first volume revealed a number of
instances of a striking or exceptional character accepted as veridical.
Some of these applied to the actual time of the test and some to the more
or less recent past. Adhering strictly to the above definitions, I fail to see
how any of the instances wherein that which was perceived belonged to the
past can be claimed as being cases of clairvoyance, seeing that they were
merely in the mental make-up of the subject and not a concrete target. In
my submission, all identified memory targets come within the definition
of telepathy.
I do not dispute that some of the instances hereinafter selected may
possibly be of a clairvoyant character but, as will readily be appreciated,
the conditions of telepathy are also present. As regards many of the other
^J. Hettinger, The Ultia-Perceptive Faculty and Exploring the Ultra-Perceptive
Faculty, Rider, London.
12 y. Hettinger [Part
instances, however, the conditions of clairvoyance are totally absent whilst
those of telepathy are always prevailing.
A. Instances in zohich the conditions of both clairvoyance and telepathy
were preseyit.
1. Sensitive /
" I see a lady's thin arm with a gold bangle, old-fashioned
type, solid looking."
Subject :
" My own arm is thin and I wear a solid gold bangle always."
2. Sensitive :
" I get an enlarged toe joint, painful."
Subject : "Yes, I have one."
In these instances it could be said, that the sensitive perceived the thin
j
arm with the solid gold bangle thereon and the enlarged toe joint clair-
voyantly ;
but, since the subjects knew of these facts, it could also be said
that the perception was of a telepathic character. The same argument
applies also to the following instances of veridical perception :
3. Sensitive : "I see a mole on this person's right hand."
Subject :
" Yes."
4. Sensitive :
" A pile of shillings as if saved for some purpose."
Subject :
" Yes, I was counting the takings in a shop at the time of the
test, about 7.10 to 7.30, and had silver in piles." (Time of the test : 7.8
to 7.18.)
5. Sensitive :
" An electric light switched on and off quickly as if for a
definite purpose."
Subject :
" Yes. This was the experiment I was doing at the above time
6.10 to 6.30." (Time of the test : 6.22 to 6.32.)
The following two examples are taken from the collection of successful
results in the tests with illustrated magazines :
6. The subject was perusing an illustrated advertisement of furniture
covers, the latter being shown on a sofa and chairs.
Sensitive :
" Fresh clean covers put on furniture."
7. The subject was looking at a large cart-horse, the caption underneath
reading :
" Biggest horse in the world . . . still growing."
Sensitive :
" Some admiration for large cart-horses."
B. Instances doubtful as regards clairvoyance, but in which the conditions
for telepathy were present.
1. Sensitive :
" Some important interest in an exhibition." (Date of
test : 12.3.36.)
Subject :
" Have taken considerable part in organisation of N.I. I. P.
(National Institute of Industrial Psychology) exhibition held 10 to 12
March)." i
I doubt that the actual exhibition could have produced a clairvoyant j
vision. There cannot, however, be any doubt of the exhibition having been '
uppermost in the subject's mind at the actual time of the test on the 12th
of March. Similar considerations apply to the following veridical ex- j
amples :
j
2. Sensitive :
" In touch with an evening class of young girls ;
waiting !
for this person to come."
Subject :
" Yes, the night of the sitting."
'
'

3. Sensitive :
" Owner read some papers I want to call proofs."
Subject :
" Yes. Yes. On this date at six o'clock." (Time of the test
5.58 to 6.8.)
It is the reference to " proofs " that makes this case doubtful as regards
clairvoyance.
The following instances of the same category belong to the tests with
illustrated magazines :
4. The subject was reading a short paragraph about 500,000 cats.
Sensitive :
" Peculiar noise going on here."
5. The subject was perusing an advertisement illustrated by two pictures
respectively inscribed :
" FIRST—Medical Science Discovered its
Magic Effect " and " THEN—we tested it in Face Creams for over three
years ".
Sensitive : " Progression."
6. The subject was lookmg at the illustration of the front of a house, an
inscription over the entrance gate reading : HOTEL RITZ GRAND
PALACE BEACH SHIP CECIL.
Sensitive :
" A red bird ;
symbol of a hotel."
C. Instances in which the conditions for telepathy were present and those
for clairvoyance entirely absent.
1. Sensitive : "I get twin babies." " .
Subject :
" Yes, I and sister are twins."
2. Sensitive :
" Some interest in Lancashire."
Subject :
" I was born in Lancashire."
As can be seen from these two examples, and the following ones, that
which was found veridical could not possibly have been perceived clair-
voyantly, in the absence of something concrete, including an illustration.
3. Sensitive :
" The mind is on inventions ; I cannot interpret it,
whether he has invented something or is inclined this way."
Subject :
" Subject is a patent agent assistant (a profession concerned
with inventions).
"
4. Sensitive : "I am not sure whether it is Thursday or Friday,—
a
remark passed by the owner." (Given 3.9.37.)
Subject :
" Yes, significant, said it at lunch that very day, 3.9.37."
5. Sensitive :
" Very peculiar feeling about a bullet, does not touch me,
cannot understand what it means." (Test on Wednesday.)
Subject :
" Yes, about Monday or Tuesday I dreamt I was shot at."
Here are, by way of example, two of the very numerous instances in
which the source of the telepathic impression was probably the sub-
conscious, as in the instance 5 just cited, since that which was accepted as
veridical occurred in the recent past and not at the actual time of the test.
6. Sensitive :
" Dripping on toast, instead of butter."
Subject :
" Yes, discussion two days before on the merits of dripping
on toast instead of butter."
7. Sensitive :
" Patting and talking to a white goat."
Subject :
" Yes, a few days ago." '
'
14 y. Hettinger [Part
The following instances belong to the collection of results obtained in
the experiments with illustrated magazines :
8. llie subject was contemplating the picture of a guide whose cap was
inscribed :
" SIGHT-SEEING GUIDE " ; the caption of the picture
was :
" AND HERE ARE THE HIGH SPOTS ".
Sensitive : "A mountain in the distance and boys roped together going
up."
9. The subject was reading about a competition :
" Naming the Stars ",
in which the names of eight film stars had to be given ; one was mentioned,
so that only seven had to be entered.
Sensitive :
" Something I am arranging with seven people."
ID. Tlie subject was reading a paragraph having the title :
" YOU
CAN'T TELL WITH PREMONITION ".
Sensitive : "It seems a long way ahead ;
talking about something the
results of which lie at the end of the year. I do not want to make a mistake."
11. One of the most striking instances occurred when two sensitives
psychometrised each other's articles, without, of course, their being aware
of it. Here is their simultaneous impression :
K :
" I hear a noise like a heavy chain being dragged along."
F :
" A large heavy chain."
When subsequently asked to verify the various impressions, neither of
the sensitives could place this one. The only explanation I can think of is,
that one of them got the impression by some association of ideas first, and
the other one then perceived it telepathically. The sensitives were miles
apart from each other.
12. I cannot resist adding the following instance from my further collec-
tion, secured since the publication of the work referred to.
The subject was looking at a caricature of the ex-Prime Minister Baldwin.
The sensitive :
" A joke about an umbrella."
This obvious reference to Chamberlain, Baldwin's successor, is a striking
illustration of that which I endeavoured to expound above regarding the
reality of telepathy, as contrasted with clairvoyance ; for there was no
umbrella on the picture contemplated by the subject, and a joke as such
cannot be seen clairvoyantly.
General comments on the problem as a whole.
" Clairvoyance " and " telepathy " being only definitions of the con-
ditions under which the transcendental perception takes place, and not the
explanation of its modus operandi, of which we are still ignorant, I submit
that it is premature to speak of either of them being the hypothesis account-
ing for the perception under the two differentiated conditions. I am
making this assertion, because of the apparent evidence that can be put
forward in support of both clairvoyance and telepathy, based on the
conditions prevailing at the time of the experience or experiment.
The bias we all have for telepathy—not excluding Dr Rhine, according
to his own admission—is probably due to the fact, that a good many of us
have had personal experience of telepathy, at some time or other, but-
hardly, if at all, of clairvoyance in the sense above defined. Irrespective
of such bias, however, I submit in conclusion, as I hope to have proved by
<1
172] Comments on Dr Rhine''s " Telept^hy ", etc. 15
citing the above instances, that the nature of that which is perceived is
often such, that a clairvoyant interpretation loses its locus standi owing to
the absence of the concrete counterpart of the perception, whilst the tele-
pathic one seems to be fully justified by the perception identifying some-
thing that is purely mental at the time of the test.
III. By R. H. Thouless ,
'
The points raised in Professor Rhine's article are deserving of attention by
all experimentalists in the field of psychical research. The question of
whether telepathy has been proved by an experiment or observation in
which all other paranormal explanations have been ruled out is obviously
a different question from that of whether telepathy is the most probable
explanation of many results which have been obtained. I also agree with
Rhine that the apparent impossibility of clairvoyance is not a reason for
deciding that it does not take place. If the results of experiments excluding
all other paranormal explanations are positive (as appears to be the case),
then they require us to revise our ideas of what is and what is not possible.
It seems to me that a very great simplification of the issues would result
if we could begin by discarding the terms " telepathy ", " clairvoyance ",
" pre-cognitive telepathy ", etc., and stating the various conditions under
which psi-cognitions might occur. The problem is then to determine, by
investigating the success of various combinations of these conditions,
which are effective in producing psi-cognitions. The conditions to be
investigated would seem to be the various combinations of (a) an event
occurring or being merely thought of (b) normal knowledge of the event
being or not being possessed by some other person, and, (c) the event, or
knowledge of the event being present (or past) at the time of the experi-
ment or being then in the future.
The possible combinations of these conditions give us the following
possibilities for investigation :
(1) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response but
it is not then known by normal perception either to the subject or to any-
one else and will not be so known at any time afterwards.
(2) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response and
it is known then by some other person or persons but is not known by any
normal process either then or at any time afterwards to the subject.
(3) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response but
it is not known then by any normal process to the subject or to anyone else
and will not be so known afterwards- to the subject although it will be by
some other person or persons.
(4) The event has taken place at the time of the subject's response and is
not known then to the subject or to anyone else but will be known by
normal perception to the subject at some time afterwards.
(5) The event will take place at some time after the subject's response
and will not be known by normal perception either to the subject or to any
other person at any time.
(6) The event will take place after the subject's response and will be
355452
:

known by normal processes of perception to some other person or persons
;
but not to the subject.
|
(7) Tlie event will take place after the subject's response and will be;
known to the subject then by normal processes of perception.
(8) No external event will take place but what is cognised will be an
unrecorded thought in the mind of some other person or persons than the
subject which thought is contemporaneous with the subject's response.
(9) No external event will take place but what is cognised is an un-
recorded thought in the mind of some other person or persons which
thought is not determined until after the subject's response.
These correspond to all possibilities that seem at present to require
investigation. Some have been done. No. i for example, is what
Rhine calls " pure clairvoyance " the evidence for which he considers in
the present article. Others are discussed in the later article which he has
kindly sent me on " Precognition reconsidered ". Other possibilities than
those listed above might be considered later, e:g. one might discriminate
between the case when the event is past and when it is present as well as
between present and future events.
Any of the above conditions might be found to be necessary to para-
normal cognition in the sense that, without it, paranormal cognition did
not take place at all. Alternatively, a number of them might be found to
be sufficient conditions in the sense that with them alone paranormal cog-
nition could take place although it might also take place in other com-
binations of conditions. Lastly, it might be found that certain of these
conditions, although not necessary to paranormal cognition, were favour-
able to it in the sense that better scores occurred with them than without.
So I should like to restate the problem as the experimental determina-
tion of what are the necessary, the sufficient, and the favouring conditions
for paranormal cognition. This is, of course, essentially no more than a
verbal restatement of the problem, but I think it helps to make the issue
clearer and to strip it of many possibilities of misunderstanding.
With respect to the possibility of devising a test of pure telepathy (No. 8
above), this seems to me less difficult than Professor Rhine suggests.
The conditions he requires are that no external event shall determine the
thought to be cognised and that no record of it shall be made. That the
experimenter should simply think of an object or card will not do, since
methods of assessing the chance score in a test of this kind are not valid if
neither the sequence of events nor that of guesses is a random one. The
problem is to devise a method of getting a random sequence in the cards
thought of by the experimenter without any external event determining
the card thought of. This can be attained by a combination of a random
external determination producing randomness and an internal determina-
tion destroying any exact correlation between the external event and the
card thought of.
I am now carrying out an experiment designed to satisfy Rhine's criteria!
for an experiment in " pure telepathy ". The method is as follows. The
subject has before him ten drawings : Anchor, Bone, Cat, Dagger, Ele-
phant, Fish, Glass, Horse, Insect and Kangaroo. I sit behind him with a
pack of 20 cards containing two each of the numbers from i to 10. Before
starting the experiment I draw out four cards and record their numbers.
the

3y a means known only to myself, I derive from these cards a number
'rem o to 9 which I shall add on to each of the numbers drawn from the
)ack during the experiment. Since there are 80 possible ways of deriving
. number from the four numbers recorded (by all possible combinations
)f ignoring, adding, or subtracting each of them), no one can tell from the
our numbers recorded what is the final number I have chosen. Yet it is
ietermined externally and not by me so that no successful result can be
ttributed to my precognition of the subject's guess. After these four
ards have been shuffled back into the pack, I draw a card and record its
lumber. I then add to its number the number previously determined and
hink of the picture corresponding to the sum so obtained (after subtracting
|en if the sum exceeds ten) : of the anchor if the sum is one, of the bone
f the sum is two, and so o'n.
The subject writes down the name of the picture he guesses that I am
hinking of. After the whole twenty cards have been used, I copy the sub-
set's responses on to my own sheet, recording how many he has guessed
ight but making no record of which particular responses are right. There
3 thus no external event either during the experiment or subsequent to it
rom which the subject could know what were the right responses by
* clairvoyance " or by " precognitive clairvoyance ". Although the ex-
eriment is completely recorded, the record would not tell anyone who
aw it which picture I was thinking of at any point unless he also knew
omething which exists only in my own mind—the method by which I
erived the number to be added to each number drawn. Success can,
herefore, only be explained as due to paranormal cognition of my thought,
hat is, to telepathy. This experimental method could obviously be easily
dapted for the detection of condition 9 (pure pre-cognitive telepathy) by
he subject making his guess before the experimenter turned up his card.
IV. By G. N. M. Tyrrell
r must have been obvious for some time, to others as well as to myself,
lat the modern tendency to pin all faith to quantitative and statistical
kthods of experiment in psychical research, with a neglect of qualitative
henomena, must lead to an unbalanced view of the subject. How un-
alanced that view can become is illustrated by Professor J. B. Rhine's
rticle, Telepathy and Clairvoyance Reconsidered, epitomised above. The
sue raised in the article of whether certain apparently telepathic pheno-
lena are in reality clairvoyant is relatively unimportant. What is of vital
nportance is that Professor Rhine has been led, through an unconscious
ias, to deal with the evidence in a completely distorted manner.
The fundamentally erroneous assumption that Professor Rhine makes is
lat evidence yielded by experiments of the card-guessing type is adequate
) reveal the essential nature of extra-sensory perception. It may be
dequate to demonstrate its existence and to illustrate some of its features ;
ut not to provide a general theory of it. Professor Rhine however, pro-
'"'^ds on the assumption that for theory-building it is virtually the only
i^idence that need be taken into account.
1 8 G. N. M. Tyrrell [Part
We all know the arguments in favour of experiments which can be com-
pletely controlled and mathematically evaluated, and we all know how
successful they have been in the physical sciences. What we have no right
to do, and what so many people have hastily done, is to assume that they
must be equally successful in psychical research. In psychical research,
the method which is completely adequate in physics can only be applied to
border-phenomena. It cannot be carried right through the subject. Arti-
ficially simplified conditions can be obtained on the periphery ;
but we
cannot go on simplifying situation after situation until we get to the heart
of the phenomena. Also what we discover by examining the periphery
does not appear to be representative of what happens further in. Tc
generalise from peripheral evidence, as Professor Rhine does in his article,
is to plunge headlong into errors.
Professor Rhine makes the startling statement that " there is at the
moment no adequately reliable case for telepathy ". He appears to mean
that statistical evidence provides no adequately reliable case for telepathy ;
but he has so over-estimated the importance of statistical evidence, and
uRcIer-estimated the importance of qualitative evidence, that he ignores
the latter altogether.
If we turn our attention for a moment from the advantages of controlled,
statistical experim.ents, and think instead of the kind of material to which
these experiments are confined, we shall see things more clearly. That
material consists of occasional faint, feeble and sporadic paranormal
impulses interjected into a series of pure, conscious guesses. These faint
impulses are slipped in here and there. But for them, the experiment is
one in normal psychology. There is the least possible interference with
normal conscious processes—just a flickering infiltration from time to
time. That is precisely why the experiment is controllable. Introduce
conditions under which the paranormal element becomes strong enough
to reveal something of its true nature, and it at once becomes spontaneous
as well. Then the experimenter's power of control is diminished and
mathematical estimation of results becomes extremely difficult if not im-
possible. The choices before us are two. (i) We may rely chiefly or
qualitative research and obser v ation for our knowledge of the paranormal,
using statistical experiment as an auxiliary to elucidate special features
and to act as a cast-iron hinge of indisputable evidence. (2) We may relj
solely on statistical evidence, condemning ourselves to remain on the fringe
of the paranormal, thereby building theories about it based on a total mis-
apprehension of the facts. Professor Rhine in his article leads the wa)
towards the latter.
The fact is that the evidence for telepathy consists of three branches:
(i) spontaneous items of evidence, (2) evidence occurring in trance and
automatic writing, (3) experimental evidence, which is not entirely
statistical, (i) There are hundreds of cases in which the straightforward
explanation is that they are telepathic in the sense of resulting from some
kind of inter-mind relation (although we do not know fundamentally what
telepathy is). Why, if someone sees a vision or hears the voice of a distant
person, should it be supposed that this is done by the clairvoyant percep-
tion of material objects ? There is nothing whatever to suggest it. (2) Or,
if, at a trance-sitting, the sitter obtains an accurate description of some

past incident in the life of a dead friend, or obtains a reproduction of the
mannerisms of that friend, why should this be put down to clairvoyance ?
How are the cross-correspondences to be explained by clairvoyance, and
why should the attempt be made ? And the masses of apparently tele-
pathic information contained in automatic writing—why attempt to torture
this into evidence for clairvoyance ? Professor Rhine does not attempt to
show how or why. He merely says that if the telepathic explanation is
preferred, this is " plainly not a matter of the weight of the evidence " !
Workers in psychical research have been so hypnotised by the success
of the completely controlled experiment in physics and in normal psycho-
logy that they are blind to the sixty years' accumulation of non-statistical
evidence which lies before their eyes.
Spontaneous cases of telepathy cannot be explained by clairvoyance,
even if precognition is added to it, because the percipient in such cases is
itji iunaware that extra-sensory perception is in progress. Being unaware,
there is nothing to guide his clairvoyant faculty towards what Prof. Broad
M calls the " cognitum ". There is no reason why an unassisted clairvoyant
ore faculty should seize upon the contemporary cognitum rather than upon
any other contemporary event which interests the percipient. Even if we
cd add precognition to clairvoyance, the same applies. There is no reason
hid why the percipient should seize upon the subsequent record of the relevant
event rather than upon any other document or record which will enter his
lal normal cognisance m the near future, such as a letter or newspaper article
or a future page of his novel, unless telepathy is there to guide him. Indeed,
iti if Prof. Rhine's hypothesis were true, sensitives would frequently precog-
ivitl tiise such documents. But they do not.
: ti Again, the hypothesis becomes an obvious absurdity when we consider-
k the record of a case of telepathy which runs into several words, for it
luj: issumes that this record is read by the percipient with complete verbal
eoii iccuracy. There is no evidence for anything like a completely accurate
an "acuity of precognition. If it existed, sensitives would be able to spread
im jefore us a complete map of the future. Card-guessing is too restricted
I'o
m experiment to show this absurdity, and Prof. Rhine has bhnded him-
ma ielf to the facts by considering only card-guessing. He has actually been
jjR ed by this self-imposed blindness to put forward a general hypothesis
rel vhich is contradicted by a large part of the evidence. His view of the
ino vhole field of paranormal phenomena is out of focus,
tnis
It is profoundly to be hoped that investigators in psychical research
vill restore some measure of balance and perspective to the subject by
urning to neglected lines of qualitative research. They alone are to any
;onsiderable degree informative, because the kind of paranormal event
vhich is amenable to statistics is too restricted in character to tell us much
bout the nature of the elusive faculty of paranormal cognition.
I wish to emphasise that this is not a personal attack on Prof. Rhine,
on vho has always been most willing that his work should be freely criticised,

V. DISCUSSION OF Prof RHINE'S PAPER AND THE
FOREGOING COMMENTS UPON IT
By C. D. Broad
The editor has submitted to me the proofs of Prof. Rhine's paper, together
witli the observations upon it made by Dr Hettinger, Dr Thouless, Mr
Tyrrell, and Mr Whately Carington, and has asked me to make my own
comments on the former in the light of the latter.
Preliminary Definitions. I shall begin by dehning certain terms which
I shall use in what follows, (i) A person, in so far as he is being tested in-
an experiment for the power of paranormal cognition or action, will be
called a Subject. (2) The person who is conducting such an experiment
will be called the Experimenter. (3) The event or thing or state of affairs
which the subject in such an experiment is trying to cognise paranormally
will be called the Target. (4) If the subject succeeds in cognising a certain
event or thing or state of affairs, whether that was his target or not, the
latter will be called the Cognition. (5) If the target or the cognitum should
be a thought or other experience or a disposition in the mind of a certain
person, that person will be called the Subjective Container.
The same person might happen to play several of these parts in an ex-
periment. Suppose, e.g., that an individual were making observations on
himself in order to find out whether he could foresee to a significant extent
what his experiences would be in certain assigned future circumstances.
Then he would be at once the subject, the experimenter, and the sub-
jective container.
Professor Rhine's main Contentions. Using this terminology, we may, I
think, state the main contentions in Prof Rhine's paper as follows, (i)
There is adequate experimental evidence for the occurrence of paranormal
cognition in cases where (i) the cognitum is something which is in principle
capable of being perceived at some time by normal sense-perception, i.e.,
is an external physical thing or event, but (ii) it in fact never has been and
never will be normally perceived or inferred either by the subject himself
or by anyone else.
(2) There is at present no adequate experimental evidence for the
occurrence of paranormal cognition in cases where (i) the cognitum is a
thought or other experience in the mind of some subjective container, and
(ii) there never has been or will be a physical thing or event which is either
(a) the object of that experience, or (b) a record which would give rise to
that experience if cognised and interpreted by the subject, or (c) a datum
from v/hich the subject could acquire that experience by normal inference
or by association if he were to cognise it.
I shall describe cases which answer to the conditions laid down in
Proposition i as " cases where telepathy is excluded ", and those which
answer to the conditions.Jaid down in Proposition 2 as " cases where
clairvoyance is excluded ". S"o Proposition i asserts that there is adequate
experimental evidence for the occurrence of paranormal cognition in cases
where telepathy is excluded ; and Proposition 2 asserts that there is not
adequate experimental evidence for the occurrence of paranormal cognition
in cases where clairvoyance is excluded.
I

(3) The evidence for Proposition 2 depends on the acceptance of Pro-
position I in its most extended form. Suppose it is granted that there is
adequate experimental evidence that a subject can at a certain moment
have paranormal cognition of a physical event that has not yet happened
or of a physical thing that does not yet exist, but which will do so later,
'a even though neither he nor anyone else will ever cognise that object by
•^1'
normal sense-perception or inference. Then obviously a great many
successful experiments which seemed to be cases excluding clairvoyance
have not certainly fulfilled that condition. Suppose, e.g., that a record,
either in speech or in writing, will be made afterwards ; and that it is of
such a nature that the subject, if aware of it, could infer from it that such
and such an event has happened. Then it is possible that the subject was
aware, at the time when he made his response, by clairvoyant precognition
of the as yet unmade record. And, if so, it is possible that his cognition
of the event which will aftenvards be recorded is due to normal inter-
^'i'o
pretation of this clairvoyant precognition of the subsequent record,
the Legitimate and illegitimate Conclusions. Since such possibilities as these
were not envisaged, it is not surprising that past experiments have not been
tail designed to exclude them ; and it is obviously desirable that new experi-
ments should be designed with that object in view. It should be noted
that, if paranormal cognition of an event is ever in fact accomplished by
interpreting one's clairvoyant precognition of an as yet unmade record of
it, we have a separation between the target and the cognitim. The target
is the event ;
but this is cognised by normal interpretation of paranormally
ub- acquired data. The cognitum is the as yet ynmade record. This is para-
normally cognised, but it is not the target at which the subject was
aiming.
Suppose that there is adequate evidence for paranormal cognition in
cases where telepathy is excluded. And suppose that it should be found
that, when experiments are done under conditions where clairvoyance is
excluded, there is not evidence for paranormal cognition. Then the con-
; elusions which could legitimately be drawn are the following, (i) In an
ii
experimental set-up of this nature, and with such subjects as have been
jused in the experiments, the presence of clairvoyant ' conditions, is both
till
necessary and sufficient to ensure a detectable amount of paranormal
IS I
;ognition. (ii) With the same qualifications, the presence of telepathic
n conditions is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure a detectable amount
k of paranormal cognition. The following conclusions would be quite
et illegitimate, (i) That either of these propositions would hold good with-
m out the qualifying clauses with which they are prefaced. It would remain
;nc possible, e.g., that either or both of them would break down in certain
spontaneous cases or if the subjects were mediums or other persons in
1
ii
whom the power of supernormal cognition was highly developed, (ii)
bid That, even when the qualifying clauses hold, the telepathic conditions are
ber causally irrelevant. In the vast majority of the successful experiments
uat neither telepathy nor clairvoyance was excluded. It would be quite il-
ase :egitimate to argue that in these cases the simultaneous normal cognition
M }£ the cognitum by other persons, or the subsequent normal cognition of
Ml it by the subject, had nothing to do with the subject's paranormal cognition
pf it. As Dr Thouless points out, we have to consider conditions which
22 C. D. Broad [Part ;
favour or check a phenomenon as well as those which are necessary or :
sufficient to produce or to inhibit it.
j
The Evidence for Propositions i and 2. As regards the evidence for Pro- ,
position I ,
i.e., that paranormal cognition has been experimentally established
in cases where telepathy is excluded, I would make the following remarks.
(i) The evidence must be of a rather peculiar kind. In order to have
reason to believe that paranormal cognition has taken place someone or
other must have reason to believe that events corresponding to the sub-
ject's guesses have happened. But in order that telepathy may be ex-
cluded no-one must ever normally perceive or infer those events.
(ii) It seems to me that Prof Rhine's procedure in such cases is always of
the following form. He infers that the subject must have known certain
things, which are not then and cannot now be normially known by anyone,
on the ground that he did certain things which he could not have done un-
less he had been guided by such knowledge. An example is provided by
the shuffling experiments. The subject shuffled pack A and got it to agree
with the target pack fi to a significantly greater extent than might be ex-
pected by chance. This required something more than paranormal cog-
nition of the arrangement of the cards in pack B, which he might have got
by telepathic precognition. It required also paranormal cognition of the
arrangement of the cards in pack A just before he made his last series of
movements. For, unless he had known how the cards in A were then
arranged, he would not have known how' to shift them about in such a way
as to conform to the arrangement of the cards in B. The argument is
similar, mutatis mutandis, to show that paranormal cognition is involved in
the dice-throwing experiments.
Now this kind of argument strikes me as somewhat naive. The position
is as follows. The subject in each case is trying to bring about a certain
spatial arrangement of physical objects, in the one experiment by handling
them in the normal way and in the other by some paranormal action called!
" psychokinesis ". The assumption which Prof Rhine makes is that the
subject must know how they are arranged immediately before he interferes
with them if he is to be able to take the appropriate action to secure the
kind of rearrangement at which he is aiming. Now this is doubtless true
of normal voluntary action guided by normal sense-perception or inference.
But we have already thrown over the rules which we normally assume to
limit human cognition so far as to allow that a person may have non-
inferential knowledge of a physical event which has not yet happened and
of which no-one ever has had or will have normal cognition. And we have
already thrown over the rules which we normally assume to limit human
voluntary action so far as to allow that a person can voluntarily affect the
position and motion of a foreign body without either (a) direct handling,
or (b) indirect manipulation through some kind of mechanism which he
controls by direct handling. When two of the most fundamental principles!
or prejudices of commonsense have thus been rejected it seems to nie a
little simple-minded to assume that the one at present under discussion,
which is so closely connected with them, can be relied upon as the premiss
of an argument. For my part, if I am forced to accept things which are so
shocking to my common-sense as precognitive clairvoyance and psycho-
kinesis, I shall feel no confidence in any of the other limiting principles
iRT 172] Comments on Dr Rhine's " Telepathy ", etc. 23
or which common-sense and ordinary natural science have always presup-
posed. And therefore I shall feel no confidence in the conclusion of any
argument which takes one of these principles as a premiss.
I pass now to the evidence for Prof Rhine's Proposition 2, viz., that
paranormal cognition has not been experimentally established in any case
m in which clairvoyance is excluded. About this I would make the following
or|remarks.
(i) Taking two of the best series of English experiments, I think we can
say that (a) in the Tyrrell experiments telepathic conditions v/ere not
necessary to secure a significant degree of success, and (b) in the Soal-
Goldney experiments telepathic conditions were necessary to secure a sig-
nificant degree of success.
In the case of the Soal-Goldney experiments the utmost that Prof Rhine
can suggest is that conceivably the telepathic conditions were necessary
only in a secondary, and not in a primary, sense. That is to say, he suggests
that perhaps what was necessary was the agent's knowledge or belief that the
telepathic conditions were fulfilled, and not the fact itself. The suggestion
is that, when this knowledge or belief is replaced by its opposite, this
got particular agent's power of paranormal cognition is inhibited so far as
th( concerns the target at which he is aiming.
About this there are two remarks to be made, (a) The suggestion re-
quires that the agent's power of paranormal cognition remains uninhibited
vajj in other directions. For we have to assume that he knows paranormally
when the experimenter switches over in the course of an experiment from
the telepathic to the non-telepathic conditions, (b) The utmost that can
be said for the suggestion is that it is just logically possible. It is not, so
far as I know, inconsistent with the reported facts that all the successes
should have been due to pure precognitive clairvoyance ; that the fulfil-
ment of the telepathic conditions should have been primarily irrelevant
;
and that the failure when the telepathic conditions are absent should be
due merely to the inhibiting effect on the subject of his purely clairvoyant
knowledge of their absence. But the suggestion is far-fetched to the
tt
highest degree ;
and, so far as I am aware, there are no positive grounds
for thinking it likely. There is one and only one motive for making it, viz.,
ice|a praiseworthy desire to stimulate experimenters to devise experiments in
which telepathic conditions are present and clairvoyant conditions com-
pletely absent, in order to find out whether paranormal cognition can then
take place.
(ii) I think that the difficulty of ensuring the complete absence of relevant
clairvoyant conditions has been in one respect exaggerated. It seems to be
til
forgotten that it is useless for the agent to have clairvoyant cognition,
whether simultaneous or precognitive, of a set of sounds or marks which
are in fact symbols for a proposition unless he also knows how to interpret
the symbols. Suppose, e.g., that the records of an experiment were made
in Sanskrit, and that the agent, like most of us, does not know that language.
Then he may have as much purely clairvoyant knowledge and foreknow-
ledge as you like of these records ; but it will not help him in the least un-
less he can tap the mind of some person who knows what the sentences
mean.
For this reason it seems to me, e.g., that Mr Whately Carington's remark
24 C. D. Broad [Part
that the clain^oyant explanation is never theoretically eliminable because
the subject might be held to be clairvoyantly aware of the brain-states, etc.,
which accompany a thought in the mind of a subjective container, is need-
lessly pessimistic. Such knowledge, so far as I can see, would not be of
the least use to the subject unless supplemented by knowledge of the laws
of correlation between brain-states and thoughts ; and these laws ex
hypothesi could not be known by pure clairvoyance.
(iii) Suppose there were a case in which a person has a mistaken belief
about the details of a certain event ; and suppose that a subject has para-
normal cognition, not of the actual details of that event, but of the features
which that person mistakenly believes it to have. This would prima facie
be a case of telepathy, simultaneous or precognitive, and not of clair-
voyance. Some well-attested cases of precognition fall, I think, under this
heading.
Prof. Rhine on Spontaneous and Mediumistic Cases. I think it would be
breaking a butterfly upon a wheel to take very seriously the remarks which
Prof Rhine throws out under this heading. Only a person with an exten-
sive knowledge of the literature of the subject, who had gone very carefully
into the details of a large number of well-attested cases of various kinds,
could make any useful pronouncement on whether any of them occur
under non-telepathic conditions and any of them under non-clairvoyant
conditions. I see no evidence that Prof Rhine has the necessary equipment
or has taken the necessary trouble to qualify him to pronounce on such
questions. And, to do him justice, I do not think that he would seriously
claim in the present paper to have done more than suggest that such an
enquiry might be worth while.
I think that the position is roughly as follows. The founders of the
S.P.R. considered that telepathy had been established by experiment with
normal persons under normal conditions. They therefore felt justified in
treating it as a vera causa, and they felt that it ought to be pressed as far as
it would go in explaining spontaneous phenomena and those occurring in
presence of mediums. Only when the hypothesis of an extended telepathy
among the living had been tried and had been found inadequate should
communication from the spirits of the dead be admitted as an hypothesis.
If that methodological principle was ever sound, it remains so still ; but it
needs to be modified in detail in the following way. We must substitute
the wider phrase " paranormal cognition " for the more special phrase
" telepathy " ; we must recognise that there is now experimental evidence
for precognition and for pure clairvoyance ; and we must admit that,
when these possibilities are allowed for, it becomes uncertain whether
many well-attested cases of paranormal cognition which were counted as
instances of telepathy really were so. I doubt whether this does much
either to strengthen or to weaken the already existing case for the spiritistic
hypothesis ; but only a detailed investigation of a wide selection of the
best cases would justify one in making any confident pronouncement on
this point.
Some Points in the other Papers. The following remarks are perhaps
just worth making.
(i) I am very much in sympathy with Dr Thouless's approach by way of
making a systematic analysis of the conditions under which paranormal
«1
«1 172] Comments on Dr Rhine's " Telepathy ", etc. 25
list cognition takes place or fails to take place. We must remember, however,
tc, that conditions which are necessary with one subject and one experimenter
ed- might prove to be superfluous or even detrimental with another subject or
:ol another experimenter.
m (2) I am puzzled to know whether islr Tyrrell really thinks that there is
fi any known alternative method of discovering the laws of phenomena be-
side that of experiment. I understand by that method the attempt to
k analyse and control conditions and to vary them one at a time. There is
ra obviously n^othing in the experimental method as such which compels us
re to confine it to the investigation of feeble instances of paranormal pheno-
10 mena. Our trouble is that we do not at present know how to produce at
lir will strong and persistent instances. Unless and until we can do so we
hi shall remain in the position of persons v/hose observations on electrical
phenomena were confined to (i) the feeble effects producible by rubbing
b glass with catskin, and (ii) occasional thunder-storms. We shall get going
id if and only if we can devise means, analogous to the Wimshurst machine,
;n the electric cell, the intensity-coil, and so on, of getting reasonably strong
ill
effects whenever we want them. If ever and whenever we do this we shall
be able to carry out experiments in psychics analogous to those which we
ji now do in physics. But until this is possible I do not believe that we shall
in make very much further progress. Meanwhile we must do our best with
in our regular catskin and our occasional thunder-storms, and there is nothing
cl
to be gained by pretending that either is the only method or that either
si
alone or both together offer any very bright prospects,
ai (3) Mr Whately Carington raises the following theoretical difficulty
about pure clairvoyance. It is meaningless to say, e.g., that a person per-
il ceives a red spot on a white card in the dark. For to say that a card which
iti
is in the dark is white and has a red spot on it means simply and solely that
11
any normal person would have visual sensations of a certain kind if ever and
a
whenever he were to view that card in white light. Now a conditional pro-
ii
position, such as this, is not an object which could intelligibly be said to be
h] perceptible. Suppose, on the other hand, we say that what is clairvoyantly
perceived in the dark, is not this conditional proposition, but a certain per-
j; sistent property which is the categorical ground of the conditional pro-
ii
position. Then, Mr Whately Carington asserts, this is meaningless because
iti
such a property by hypothesis could never be perceived by any of the senses,
s
And what is in principle incapable of being perceived is a mere fiction,
ci
If I have understood this argument correctly, it seems to me to beg the
It
question. Either it is or it is not conceivable that there should be direct
e:
acquaintance with particulars by other means than ordinary sense-
a;
perception. If we say that it is not conceivable, then we rule out the possi-
;r bility of clairvoyance by definition. If, on the other hand, we admit that it
i(
is conceivable, we must widen our criterion of " existence " and say that
I,;
what exists must in principle be capable of being perceived either by the
,[
senses or clairvoyantly. But in that case we cannot maintain the present
objection to saying that what the clairvoyant perceives in the dark is the
p,
persistent categorical ground of a certain conditional proposition about
normal visual perception. Certainly this is in principls^ incapable of being
0
perceived by the senses ; but that is only one of the two alternatives which
; the extended principle admits.

VI. NOTES ON DR RHINE'S " TELEPATHY AND
CLAIRVOYANCE"!
By Denys Parsons
Rhine has not given " spontaneous " cases the attention they deserve.
Some of these support telepathy and some support clairvoyance. In the
latter class we have the well-known case of Mrs Titus, which finally con-
vinced William James of the reality of psychic phenomena (Richet " Le
Sixieme Sens ", p. 55). A young girl disappeared. Two or three days
later Mrs Titus who lived about 5 miles away, dreamt that she saw the
body in a particular spot. Later she explained to a diver that the body
was wedged in a certain position under a bridge. The diver went down
and found the body exactly in the position described. A similar case
{Jour., S.P.R. 1889, IV, 93) deals with the finding of the bodies of two
men and their dogs.
To explain these cases by telepathy one could argue that the message
was sent before death and remained latent for some time in the percipient's
subconscious mind. Clairvoyance gives a more direct explanation, but
the survival hypothesis will also fit.
Particularly impressive as evidence for clairvoyance are cases in which
inanimate objects are located in unexpected places. Dowsing comes into
this category, although in my opinion the evidence for this phenomenon
cannot yet be considered satisfactory.
Powerful support for telepathy is provided by Soal's " John Ferguson
"
case (" A Report on Some Communications received through Mrs Blanche
Cooper "—Prof. S.P.R. 1925, XXXV). Soal's private conjectures about
a purely fictitious character of his own invention were confirmed at his
next sitting with the medium, often with considerable accuracy and detail.
Referring to these experiments Soal says :
" No written notes were made
of my conjectures about '
John Ferguson '
until after I had recorded the
medium's confirmatory statement. At the time I had not the remotest
idea of any future publication. If therefore these conjectures were
accessible to clairvoyance it could only be a kind of '
precognitive
'
clairvoyance."
But it is highly probable that Soal would not have made any notes if
the medium had been wrong, therefore the medium had to be right before
the records which would permit precognitive clairvoyance could come into
existence. Since Rhine has used an exactly analogous argument to sup-
port clairvoyance in Screened Touch Matching of card decks, he can
hardly deny its validity here as a strong argument for telepathy.
In discussing the Soal and Goldney experiments Rhine argues that the
fact that only certain persons were successful agents is only suggestive of
telepathy, since the subject's attitude or belief is a great factor in deter-
mining success or failure. But it was not quite so simple ; the significant
fact from the point of view of telepathy was that different agents caused
not major differences in scores but major differences in the nature of the
displacement effects.
^ The following comments were received after Dr Broad had written his summing-
up, and therefore are not included in his observations. Hon. Ed.
lya] Dr J. B. Rhine s Reply 27
Soal and Goldney's subject failed when the conditions began to approach
those of clairvoyance. Rhine argues that this is not necessarily good
evidence for telepathy since "the mere fact that the subject believed his
ability was telepathy " could have inhibited his success. I must put it on
record that Shackleton was equally confident in his ability to demonstrate
clairvoyance with the coloured counters in my own apparatus. (The
results of both telepathy and clairvoyance tests with B. S. agreed with
chance expectation.)
Now Shackleton failed in clairvoyance and succeeded in telepathy even
when he did not know which of the two conditions the experimenters
were using. Rhine argues that he might have known (clairvoyantly)
which technique was being used. But is it not strange that he should get
100% success in detecting a change in technique, considering that his
true cognitions of the card symbols never rose above 30% ? (Rhine's
reply to this is that there may have been some inherent factor in the clair-
voyant conditions themselves which caused the failure.)
Turning now to the American work, I consider Rhine has made out an
excellent case for clairvoyance, and if the empirical facts are accepted, I
do not think that it profits us much to argue that clairvoyance is a contra-
diction in terms or that there is no place for it in our philosophy.
DR. J. B. RHINE'S REPLY
It was a generous arrangement which permits me to reply to the comments
given above. First, it should be said that, if my article had to be abridged
in the interests of space, a better condensation could hardly have been
made. I am naturally pleased, too, that this paper is regarded as worthy of
reproduction in the S.P.R. Proceedings, although as an experimenter I
would naturally not have chosen a non-experimental article such as this to
represent me in your pages.
The aim of my discussion was mainly to urge that experiments of better
design be directed toward the problem of the occurrence of telepathy. As
it turned out, no one, I believe, has questioned the need for these. There is
disagreement only on the question of how badly we need the new experi-
ments. By far the most important development resulting from the article
is the fact that Professor Thouless has already begun a newly designed
experiment in pure telepathy. His procedure seems to be an excellent one.
Here at Duke University we think we have now found it possible, as a
a result of group thinking stimulated by these discussions, to apply an
independent check on the accuracy of the experimenter's observations, and
thus to put the test on a par with the best clairvoyance tests. In using this
procedure the experimenter communicates his code to an assistant through
subjective associations based upon common memories and having no
objective link that could be traced by clairvoyance even by precognitive or
retrocognitive clairvoyance.
Professor Broad's article has a number of suggestions likely to be of
value in experimental work. One of these is his remark about the useless-
ness for clairvoyance of objective signs. He uses the illustration of the
2^ DrJ. B. Rhine's Reply [Part
records of an experiment being made in Sanslcrit, if the agent does not know
that language Also his comment on Mr Carington's remark about the
clairvoyance of bram states appears to take care of a troublesome aspect of
the telepathy problem. ^

does )

eyes (one of which can be seen in the photograph) through which a tape
is passed, the box can be etTectively sealed so as to be reasonably fraud-
proof, and may be given to a percipient to take home. The percipient
can thus make clairvoyant trials at his leisure, a few in the morning, a
few more at night, when he feels in the mood.
The apparatus is prepared for use in clairvoyance tests according to a
rigid routine. The quantity of counters decided on (50, 100, or 200) is
placed in a 16 oz. narrow-necked glass bottle. From this moment on
until the final counting of hits the experimenter neither sees nor handles
the counters. He retires alone to an adjoining room and sits down at a
table under which the apparatus is placed. Leaning well forward over
the table he holds the bottle underneath it in a horizontal position. Then,
with fingers and thumb loosely round the neck of the bottle, he gives it
ICQ rapid half-turns with the other hand to shuffle the counters. Still
keeping the bottle under the table, he removes the cap and delivers the
counters into the chimney hopper by slowly .rotating and shaking the
bottle over it. The chimney is then corked up and the apparatus may
then be lifted up and taken back to the room where the percipient
is waiting. The percipient may sort the counters himself or he may
call out his guesses to a neutral operator. (The latter procedure was
rarely used.)
After the sorting the apparatus is opened ^ and the number of successes
is counted (i.e. the number of blue counters found in the blue compartment
plus the reds in the red, etc.). The procedure satisfies the conditions for
clairvoyance.^ Neither the experimenter nor the percipient, nor any
living thing knows, or ever will know what was the order of the counters
in the tube, or the result of any individual trial. The only figures obtained
are the total number of trials and the total number of successes. There
can be no question of mental transference between two people, whether
precognitive or otherwise.
At first runs of 200 counters were given, but when only chance results
were obtained it was decided to cut dow-n the number of trials per run in
case fatigue eff^ects were neutralising initial successes. Table I gives the
number of runs of 200, 100, and 50 or less.

^ In order to ensure that nothing can be deduced by noting the colours of the
counters uppermost in each compartment at the end of a run, an additional safe-
guard is introduced. The apparatus is replaced under the table and the contents
of each compartment in turn are emptied into a small box which is then shaken up
a few times before exposing the counters.
^ I do not wish to imply here that if significant results were obtained under these
conditions, it would provide evidence of a straightforward faculty analogous to
ordinary vision.
3° Denvs Parsons [Part
The machine enables one to test Clair\oyance and Telepathy under
almost identical conditions, the difference being that for Telepathy the peep-
hole is opened and an agent can see the counters during the sorting. The
sort of results hoped for were either :
(a) the subject scores significantly on Telepathy and Clairvoyance,
or (b) the subject scores significantly on Telepathy but gets only chance
scores on Clairvoyance, or vice versa.
Unfortunately all results were in accordance with chance.
Schmeidler (" Predicting good and bad scores." J. Amerkan Soc.
Psych. Res. 1943,37, 103-110,210-221 ; 1945, 39, 47-49) divided percipients
into two groups : those who believed they could succeed (the " sheep "),
and those who expected to fail (the " goats "), in ESP tests. The sheep
scored positively and the goats negatively. The results of the sheep were
independently significant and the difference between the scores of the
two groups was highly significant. This procedure was foUov/ed with the
44 percipients of the present series of experiments. At the conclusion of
the experiments the percipients were divided into sheep and goats, without
reference to their scores, as accurately as was possible from a personal
estimate of their character and philosophy of life, and from memory of
the attitude they had shown to the experiments. (Most of the percipients
were friends or acquaintances.) The experimenter classes himself as a
sheep, but lists his own results separately since they far outnumber those
of any other individual.

Nineteen percipients were tested for Clairvoyance only, ten for

children to whom rewards were ofi'ered for high scores, but without
success.
In the hope of finding significance in decline effects, the first runs of
each of the 44 subjects were summed (Table III).

Dr Thouless pointed out to me that if the clairvoyance and telepathy
totals for sheep were pooled, a just significant result is obtained. (Chi^
3-87, p=o-05). Odds of 20 to I against chance cannot be regarded as
more than suggestive, but a watch will be kept on first runs of sheep in
future experiments. Further investigation showed that there is no signi-
ficant difference between the first and second run totals of sheep, nor
between first and fourth run totals, but there was a significant difference
between first and last run totals (C.R. = 2-3). Unfortunately this signifi-
cance is almost certainly due to " optional stopping " after a low-scoring
run.
Mr Whatelv Carington kindly made a full analysis of the records of
one percipient, which showed a pronounced decline over sixteen runs, but
he was unable to extract any significance from them.
The failure to get any positive results is disappointing. Among the
percipients were two or three professional mediums and also Basil Shackle-
ton who v.as tested soon after the end of Soal's experim^ents. On one
occasion the apparatus was lent to Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell for a fortnight.
He kindly carried out telepathy tests vith Mrs Hepvood and Miss G.
Johnson (who was his original percipient for his electrical machine, Proc.
S.P.R. 1936, XLIV, 99-167), but the results were very close to chance.
If any member wishes to see the apparatus or to make a copy of it for
his own use he is assured of the fullest co-operation. A new series of
experiments has been started in which percipients are offered rewards for
high scores on a graduated scale.
Summary
A mechanical device for investigating ESP under conditions of Clair-
voyance and of Telepathy has been devised. No evidence of ESP was
found in 24,000 trials with 44 subjects.

" The Trial of Mrs Duncan " : Review.
The third book^ in the " Old Bailey Trial " series, consists of a verbatim
report of the fascinating and sensational trial of the medium Helen Duncan.
Between its covers is sufficient material to occupy a serious psychical
research student for many months.
The interest of the Duncan trial is threefold. Firstly, it contains
valuable data on the problem of the Duncan mediumship. Secondly, it
constitutes a first-rate study of human testimony in relation to psychic
phenomena. Thirdly, the trial is directly concerned with the law relating
to psychic phenomena, with which it is our duty to be familiar.
There are, therefore, three important problems to be considered in the
light of the Duncan trial, and they are dealt with separately in the three
brief articles immediately following this review. It is hoped that readers
of these articles will be encouraged to obtain the book under review and
study it for themselves.
The report of the trial occupies over three hundred pages and constitutes
the major portion of the book. It is introduced by an editorial, in which
the course of the trial is summarised and discussed, apparently from the
point of view of the lay sceptic. A report of the judgment at the Court
of Criminal Appeal, to which the case was eventually taken, is included,
'
and a brief historical note on the Old Bailey by Helena Normanton appears
at the end. The book is illustrated by photographs of the chief characters
concerned.
/. HELEN DUNCAN : A BRIEF HISTOR Y OF HER MEDIUM-
SHIP
Helen Victoria Duncan is unquestionably the most famous member of
that rare species, the contemporary British materialising medium. It
would be a defiance of our proverbial national pride not to give her a
place in the Proceedings.
Mrs Duncan was born in Callander, Perthshire, in 1898. She is of
working-class antecedents and married a cabinet-maker, who blessed her
with a large family and then retired from work for many years.
Scotland was the scene of Mrs Duncan's earliest exploits, but her fame
inevitably spread and soon reached the pages of the London Spiritualist
journal Light.
Major C. H. Mowbray had some sittings with the Duncans in Scotland,
and wrote, an account for the British College of Psychic Science in London.
He was of the opinion that she was fraudulent.
INVESTIGA TIONAT THELONDONSPIRITUALIST ALLIANCE
The first systematic investigation of which we have a record is that
'
carried out by the Research Department of the London Spiritualist
Alliance in the course of some fifty sittings extending from October 1930
to June 193 1. The investigators included Dr Fielding Ould, Sir Ernest
^ The Trial of Mrs Duncan. Edited, with a Foreword, by C. E. Bechhofer
Roberts. London : Jarrolds, 1945. 125. bd.

34 Donald J. West [Part
Bennett, Lord Charles Hope, Miss Mercy Phillimore, (Secretary to the
L.S.A.) and Dr Rust. They were not all present at ever}? sitting. Oc-
casional visitors included Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr E. J . Dingwall, Mrs K. M.
Goldney and other S.P.R. members.
Two interim reports were published in Light (Feb. 28th and May i6th,
193 1
) which were favourable to the mediumship, but the third and final
report {Light, July 17th, 1931) was written in a completely different tone
and accused Mrs Duncan of fraudulent practices. The Committee had
come to the conclusion, as the investigation proceeded, that Mrs Duncan
resorted to fraud, but they were never agreed as to the proportion of
fraudulent to genuine phenomena. By the kindness of the Secretary and
Council of the L.S.A., we have been allowed to study the original accounts
of these Duncan seances and to see the specimens of purported ectoplasm
which were obtained. *
At a typical Duncan seance the sitters are seated in a single or double
crescent with the medium in a corner of the room that is curtained off and
known as the cabinet. The room is illuminated with red light, sometimes
fairly strongly, but inside the cabinet there is deep shadow. Suspicious
as these conditions are, Mrs Duncan caijnot be held responsible for them,
since they are traditional among phj'sical mediums. I
Mrs Duncan is stripped, searched, dressed in specially designed seance
garments and led to her chair within the cabinet. Mr Duncan is usually |
somewhere at the back of the room, behind the sitters, operating a gramo-
phone, i
Mrs Duncan passes into her trance state and the voice of Albert Stuart,
j
her spirit control, is heard. Albert is said to have been a pattern-maker
of Dundee, who emigrated to Sydney, Australia. There appears to be no i
evidence that Albert's voice is independent of the medium's larynx. His i
function is to direct the proceedings, and no sitter may move, or touch the
manifestations, without his permission.
The phenomena consist of purported ectoplasm and materialisations.
The ectoplasm is in the form of sheets and coils of white material, seen
draped about the medium when the cabinet curtains are pulled apart. On
occasion the medium walks right out of the cabinet with yards of this
strange material draped all over her and trailing in a train behind her.
At the L.S.A. the materialisations were white shapes, dimly seen through
the gap between the curtains and roughly approximating to human forms,
but with faces absent or else hardly recognisable. i
The main problem of the Duncan mediumship is how the white material
gets into the cabinet when medium ^nd cabinet have been searched
meticulously beforehand. The sceptic's answer to the Duncan ectoplasm
is that the stuff consists of fine-mesh material, that is cheese-cloth or
butter-muslin, which is capable of being compressed into comparatively
small volume. The tulle is swallowed by the medium prior to a seance,
regurgigated under cover of the cabinet curtains when ectoplasm is re-
quired, and swallowed again at the end of the sitting.
This explanation sounds so fantastic that unless there had been some
very good supporting evidence it need hardly have been taken into con-
sideration. Anyone who has had experience of the time and effort required
to swallow a narrow rubber tube for the purpose of a stomach examination
iy2] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 35
must marvel at Mrs Duncan and her yards of cheese-cloth. Although
choking noises have been reported at Duncan seances, often enough the
regurgitation must have been accomplished swiftly and silently.
There is, of course, the possibility that the medium could have evaded
the search and produced the cheese-cloth without regurgitation. Doubt-
less the search was sometimes performed by modest persons, who might
be somewhat perfunctory, in which case the packet of '
props '
could be
concealed by passing it quickly from one part of the body to another. The
medium could never be sure of this, however, and she could never be
certain that a vaginal and rectal examination would not be requested.
Moreover, the methods of search adopted at the Harry Price sittings have
been described to us in some detail, and they appear to preclude the regular
practice of this type of fraud.
Another possible explanation, which would do away with the necessity
for assuming regurgitation, is that a confederate passed the cheese-cloth
to Mrs Duncan during the course of the seance. Mr Duncan's continual
presence is suspicious. The only time Mr Duncan was not present during
the London investigations at the L.S.A. and the National Laboratory was
at one of the Harry Price sittings, and on that occasion no cheese-cloth
appeared. However, it is only fair to state that there may have been other
reasons for its absence on this occasion. Moreover, having regard to the
good lighting conditions at some of the seances, and the fact that Mr
Duncan was at the back of the room, this explanation also seems to be
ruled out. Whatever method of fraud Mrs Duncan used, if fraud it was,
was absolutely dependable, for hardly a sitting went by without some
'
cheese-cloth '
appearing.
At some of the L.S.A. sittings '
Albert '
left behind specimens of
'
ectoplasm '
—five in all—for the investigators to examine. The last speci-
men, obtained on April loth 193 1, was cut away as it protruded a few inches
out of the medium's mouth. At this seance, the medium had been
searched as usual and dressed in a one-piece suit with neck, arms and ankles
tied with tapes and sealed to her chair. She wore gauntlets fastened at the
wrists with surgical tape. Two of the earlier specimens were found to be
" paper, cloth, and such everyday materials", mixed with an organic
, substance in every way similar to white of egg. The last two specimens
i were pads of surgical gauze soaked in resinous fluid. They were identical
with a sanitary towel which Mrs Duncan left behind one day in a dressing-
room which only she had used.
Mrs Duncan also gave the L.S.A. specimens of abnormal urine, which
were loaded with absurdly large quantities of albumen, said to be due to
the effect of the materialisation phenomena on her metabolism. Shortly
after this, Mrs Duncan had occasion to attend St. Thomas's Hospital,
where her urine was tested and found to be normal.
When it is remembered that these adverse findings are recorded by a
Spiritualist Association, there can be no doubt that Mrs Duncan resorts to
fraud of one sort or another on certain occasions.
To return to the regurgitation hypothesis, the L.S.A. investigation
affords the sceptic several pieces of evidence that this was the method of
fraud employed. Although it was not photographed, the appearance and
feel of the '
ectoplasm '
was compatible with the assumption that it was
36 Donald y. West '
"
[Part
ordinary cheese-clotli, and under the conditions of some of the sittings
regurgitation may have been the only method whereby such material could
have been introduced into the cabinet.
Many times the stuff was seen apparently issuing from the medium's
mouth. At the sitting on May 29th 1931, the medium came right out of:
the cabinet and stood under the light. The substance was seen comin."
out of her mouth in a strip about i\ inches wide and 12 inches long. It
'
was slowly drawn back into the mouth to the accompaniment of swallowing
movements of the lower lip and throat.^ This incident is only evidence
for regurgitation provided one is willing to assume that the manifestation
in question was not genuine ectoplasm. One must also bear in mind
that the piece seen to be swallowed was small compared with the yards of
'
cheese-cloth '
that had been witnessed at other times.
Better evidence for regurgitation was obtained at the last L.S.A. sitting
on June 12th 193 1. Mrs Duncan was made to swallow a pill containing
methylene blue, which would stain any material that might be lying in her
stomach. This was the only one of all the L.S.A. sittings at which no
ectoplasm was produced. During the sitting the medium put out her
tongue and this was claimed by Albert to be ectoplasm.
Dr Margaret Vivian reports (in a letter to Mr Abdy Collins) that on
two occasions at Bournemouth Mrs Duncan produced white ectoplasm
after swallowing methylene blue, but it is possible that the conditions were
such as to allow her to conceal the stuff without swallowing it.
Unfortunately for the sceptic, regurgitation and skilful manipulation of
cheese-cloth will not explain all the happenings at the L.S.A. seances. The
conditions were variable and often informal, but at times the control was
very stringent. The medium was completely stripped, searched, and put
into a one-piece suit. The trouser legs ended at the bottom in bags which
enclosed her feet. The hands were enclosed in stiff buckram mittens,
which were sewn to the sleeves of the suit. The opening at the back'
through which the medium entered the garment, was sewn up to the neck.
On two occasions a code stitch was used, that is, the stitches were ar-
ranged in a special pattern which would be difficult to imitate. The neck
band was strong, close-fitting and inelastic.
These were the conditions obtaining at the seance on May 12th 1931,
at which large masses of ectoplasm were seen coming, apparently, from the
medium's mouth. Dr Dingwall was allowed to touch the stuff. Albert
asked if it fek like rubber, but Dr Dingwall said it was warmer and harder
than rubber. Another time during the same seance, the cabinet curtains I
were parted, and while both Mrs Duncan's hands, enclosed in the buckram
mittens, were visible to the sitters, a light switch inside the cabinet was
turned on and off by invisible means. At the end of the sitting the
stitching on the back of the seance suit was examined and found intact.
At a sitting on May 8th 1931, Mrs Duncan was stripped and searched
as usual. A vaginal examination was performed, and she was put into a
^ It was this incident which led the L.S.A. to think that Mrs Duncan might be
regurgitating. Although we have discussed the possibility of regurgitation on a
much larger scale, the L.S.A. is not responsible for the suggestion that Mrs Duncan
concealed or regurgitated large masses of ectoplasm on the occasions when yards
of the material were seen.

one-piece suit, but without gloves. At this sitting, while the medium's
hands were held by Miss Phillimore and Dr Fielding Ould, there was a
sound of splashing within the cabinet. Some wax and a bowl of water
had been placed there for the purpose of obtaining wax impressions. A
wax '
glove '
was left behind, but it did not bear any skin markings. At
the same sitting, while both the medium's hands were said to be visible.
Miss Phillimore was held by a third hand, which was wet.
Under the conditions described, if regurgitation be the correct explana-
tion, the medium would have had to add to her cheese-cloth meal a rubber
glove and probably a collapsible rod as well. (See Plate III.)
Remarkable feats of rope tying were witnessed at some of the sittings.
The most noteworthy incident of this nature took place on Nov. 28th 1930.
The medium was stripped and dressed in dark coloured shoes, stockings,
knickers and coat. She was then lead into the seance room and placed
inside a net bag, which was tied at the neck and the tape sealed to her
chair. A length of rope was left lying in the cabinet, and during the course
of the sitting the medium was found to be securely bound inside the sack
without breaking the seals, the rope being wound tightly round each ankle,
and a loop carried round her neck, while her wrists were tied together
behind her back. It is not suggested that these eifects were necessarily
paranormal, but if not, they indicate considerable skill and dexterity on the
medium's part.
Further demonstrations of agility were given on the several occasions
on which the medium was released from her seance-suit and brought out
naked. The stitches at the back of the suit looked intact, but on one
occasion Lord Charles Hope discovered a needle and thread, which the
medium might have surreptiously introduced for the purpose of restitching
the gap made by her bursting out of the suit.
On May 5th 1931, code-stitching was used to sew up the back of the
medium's suit. The arms were fastened to her chair with surgical tape,
but Albert insisted on this being loosened so -many times that it ceased to
be an effective control. At one point on each side of the collar of the
seance-suit there was sewn the end of a broad band of tape. The other
ends of the tapes were sealed to her chair. The ankles were also sealed
to the chair with tapes.
Mrs Duncan emerged from all this, leaving the seals apparently intact.
Later examination revealed that the code stitching at the back of the
garment had been undone and sewn up differently. Still the gap would
have been too small to let Mrs Duncan out unless the neck fastenings and
seal had also been undone and replaced in some way. On this occasion
no needle and thread were found in spite of the allegedly diligent search.
During the course of the same seance, the ectoplasm accidentally caught
on something outside the cabinet. A series of piercing screams, most
disconcerting to the investigators, came from the medium in the cabinet.
Albert said she was hurt, and after a pause he ordered the sitters to help
her out of the cabinet. Mrs Duncan was found, as already described,
free of her seance-suit and completely naked.
On examination, Mrs Duncan was found to have sustained what ap-
peared to be a burn. Such an appearance might have been produced by
friction or other means. In fact, Mrs Duncan had been given a cigarette
38 Donald J. West [Part!
before the burn was noticed, and the injury was just sych a round mark as'
might be expected to result from the touch of a hghted cigarette end, but
if that were the case she must have been wilHng to submit herself to con-
siderable pain.
After the last L.S.A. sitting on June 12th, Mr Duncan made a statement
in which he declared he had come to the conclusion that the '
ectoplasm '
was produced by regurgitation.
THE HARRY PRICE INVESTIGATION
While the last series of L.S.A. sittings was drawing to a close, Mr Harry
Price procured Mrs Duncan's services for five sittings at the National
Laboratory of Psychical Research.
^
The National Laboratory investigators did not adopt any form of control
of the medium's person ;
they relied entirely upon the rigorous search
that was carried out before and after each sitting. Mrs Duncan would
be stripped naked and the surface of her body thoroughly explored in the
presence of several suitable investigators. Vaginal and rectal examinations
were performed at two of the sittings. The medium would then be dressed
in a black one-piece seance-suit, taken to the room, where the sitters
awaited her, and led directly to her chair in the cabinet.
Special precautions were taken to prevent collusion with Mr Duncan.
During the preliminaries of searching etc., man and wife were in separate
rooms. In the seance room itself, Mr Duncan was never allowed near the
cabinet. He was kept at the far back of the room, behind the sitters. The
light was fairly good, and it seems absurd to suggest that he could have
thrown a package to his wife over the heads of the sitters or between their
legs.
Collusion between medium and one or more of the investigators is a
possibihty always raised by the resolute sceptic, but once a critic has been
forced into this position, all discussion ends, because it is impossible to
drive him further.
The National Laboratory seance-suit had trouser legs which enclosed
the medium's feet, like the one at the L.S.A. The sleeves ended in mittens,
which were in one piece with the rest of the garment. Unfortunately, this
suit was ineffective as a means of control. Mrs Duncan was seen to free
an arm with the greatest of ease. She could wriggle the arm out of its
sleeve and then push the hand out at the neck.
The theory of regurgitation was once again the key-note of the investi-
gation. The best evidence for it lies in the flashlight photographs taken
by Harry Price, which prove conclusively that the ectoplasmic manifesta-
tions were only cheese-cloth. They show the medium variously adorned
and draped with a big sheet of the material. The interlacing warp and
woof and the selvedge marks are plainly visible. (See Plate II.) There are
rents and tears and even the marks of folding. One particular tear, iden-
tified by its size, shape and position, appeared at two seances, proving that
the same piece of cheese-cloth was used for both.

of Psy. Research, London, 1931.)
I
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 39
I
The manifestations were not entirely restricted to crude cheese-cloth,
but in all cases the mundane origins of the phenomena were revealed by the
camera and stereoscope.
At the first seance the conditions were informal. Mrs Duncan was
dressed in her own seance garments, and a pin was used to fasten them.
During the sitting, a piece of ectoplasm was seen stretched out at right
angles to the medium, but she moved a little and there was a click. The
ectoplasm fell and both Mrs Goldney and Mr Barry Richards were able to
see the pin with which it had been attached to the cabinet curtain.
A pin appeared in the photographs taken at the third seance, and
after the fourth seance a small gilt safety-pin was found concealed in a
tuck inside the seance suit. Safety-pins had been discovered previously
by the L.S.A. investigators, so they must be a fairly constant feature of
the ectoplasmic machinery.
At the third seance, a hand was materialised, but in the photographs it
was revealed as a rubber glove. At the fourth seance, Mr Duncan said he
saw a materialised face, which he described. The light was too poor for
the others to see any face, but the camera showed that there had been a
flat, cut-out picture of a girl's head, seen in profile and draped in cheese-
cloth.
The investigators concluded that all these objects had been regurgitated.
The stomach was the only place that had not been searched. The naso-
pharynx was also suggested, but that would be too small and not very
safe. On several occasions at London, doctors examined Mrs Duncan's
throat before the sitting. Harry Price thought a secondary stomach or
oesophageal diverticulum might be the solution, but it is difficult to see
how such a peculiarity would assist her. Regurgitation from a diverti-
culum would be even less likely than from a normal stomach. In point of
fact Mrs Duncan has been given a barium meal and an X-ray taken of her
oesophagus and stomach,^ but no abnormality was seen.
At the end of the fourth seance permission was asked for an X-ray of
her abdomen to be taken. It was thought that some radiologically opaque
constituent of her '
props '
might be detected. Mrs Duncan proved un-
willing, becoming restless and finally running out into the street followed
by her husband. When she was brought back, she then demanded an
X-ray, but nothing was revealed. Mr Duncan was asked if he would
submit to a search, since his wife had had the opportunity of passing
something to him in the street. He excused himself on the grounds of
dirty underwear, but later explained that at the time of the seance his
wife was having a menstrual period and on the way to the laboratory she
had passed him a couple of sanitary towels, and the presence of these
objects might have been misinterpreted by the investigators. Mrs Goldney
stated that the medium was not menstruating when she was searched
before the sitting.
At the last sitting (the only one at which Mr Duncan was not one of the
sitters) no cheese-cloth appeared. A few inches of ' ectoplasm '
protruded
from the medium's mouth and a small piece was amputated by one of the
doctors present. It proved to be layers of lavatory paper stuck together.
It is interesting to note that whenever a specimen of ectoplasm was given,
^ Psychic Science, July 1942, xxi, p. 49.
40 Donald J. West [Part
either at the L.S.A. or the National Laboratory, it never came from the
large mass of drapery that was the usual manifestation.
After a consultation with Mr Duncan, at which the regurgitation theory
was explained to him, it was agreed to hold one more seance and to have
Mrs Duncan fastened to her chair. Before the appointed day arrived,
Mrs Duncan fled to Scotland. Mr Duncan was promised £iooii he would
induce his wife to regurgitate in front of a cinematograph camera, but the
offer was never taken up.
In February 1932, a certain Mary McGinlay, who had been Mrs Duncan's
maidservant at the time of the London sittings, contacted Mr Harry Price
and made a statutory declaration implicating her former mistress in fraudu-
lent practices. In this document, the maid swears that Mrs Duncan sent
her out to buy a length of butter muslin, which was returned to her to
wash after some of the seances. She could even recognise the very same
piece in Price's photographs ! She also claims to have discovered in Mrs
Duncan's possession rubber gloves, cut-out pictures from magazines and
other implements of deception. As confirmation of every single surmise
of the National Laboratory investigators, this document is very remark-
able. There is one curious discrepancy. Mary McGinlay implies that
Mrs Duncan deceived her husband with her tricks, whereas there is ample
evidence in Mr Duncan's behaviour and statements at both the L.S.A.
and the National Laboratory that he was aware of what was going on.
Mr Mclndoe states that two days after her return to Scotland this same
servant girl assured him she had never at any time seen anything to suggest
that Mrs Duncan was acting fraudulently.
^
So much for the evidence for regurgitation. Though circumstantial, it
is strong, and is supported by the weak evidence for any other normal
explanation. Mrs Duncan is not the only person to have had a reputation
for regurgitating powers. A regurgitator of Prague is reported to have
swallowed and brought up again as many as twenty live frogs." Swallowers
of glass, nails and miscellaneous ironmongery are comparatively common,
but they are unable to regurgitate. A demonstration of chewing and
swallowing (without regurgitation) of an electric light bulb, razor blades, a
gramophone record and some flowers was given by Mr Arthur Haylock
at the S.P.R. on May 5th 1944. Regurgitation has also been suggested as
an explanation of some of the phenomena of Eva C.
Spiritualist Experiences
After Harry Price's formidable armaments had brought about her retire-
ment into the provinces, Mrs Duncan's career entered a phase which can
only be described as a scientific blackout. Shielded by a horde of uncritical
sympathisers, Mrs Duncan was able to carry on her activities unhindered
by X-rays, cameras or surgical strapping, with the result that she became
the most famous British materialising medium.
Mr J. B. Mclndoe, President of the Spiritualist National Union,
championed Mrs Duncan, proclaiming her a martyr to the cause. She
became more and more prosperous, travelling about and holding sittings
^Psychic Science, xxi, p. 50.
-Proc. S.P.R. xxvii, p. 348.
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 41
in the homes of the faithful all over the country. Stories of her wonders
were broadcast far and wide. The sheets of ectoplasm developed into
fully built-up materialisations, and accounts of spirit recognitions at Duncan
seances became almost a regular feature in the popular spiritualist weekly
Psychic News.
In November 193 1, Dr Montague Rust, an ardent Duncan supporter,
wrote to Mrs Goldney, who is an S.P.R. member and who had taken a
prominent part in the Harry Price sittings. Dr Rust's letter is so typical
of the claims and attitude of Mrs Duncan's followers that it is worth
quoting extracts. He writes :
" There are very few people who have had the honour of sitting with
Mrs Duncan as often as I have. ... I have had unbounded opportunity
of examining her and the material and beings whom she '
regurgitated '.
In fact she '
regurgitated '
my brother-in-law, Charles Ross, and my
driver, Andrew Barclay, and my dog. Hector. We had long conver-
^tions with them in their own characteristic voices and varying memories.
Hector was life-like in all his actions and ran about the floor as he did
in life. Forms came out and sat on some of the sitters' knees and spoke
and ate apples and drank water. One spirit form removed my boots
forcibly and put them on and walked about with them.
Mrs Duncan also dematerialised in my presence wholly and partially
in decent red light. She was also levitated 3 feet off the ground, chair and
all. ... I have seen a lump of what you call cheese-cloth the size of a
football thrown on the ground with such force that we thought the floor
was broken. I have had a rope of this cheese-cloth thrown round my
neck with such force and rapidity that I was hauled off the chair. I have
seen a huge form '
swallowed '
back by the medium in the fraction of a
second, causing obvious bleeding and injury. ..."
" The theory in Mr Price's books that she regurgitated cheese-cloth
etc. is absolutely preposterous and is the most fantastic theory ever
brought forward. If she really can do this, the wonder of her powers is
far in excess of any mediumship that I know of. She can make this
cheese-cloth talk, move like lightning, take different shapes and have
enormous force."
Dr Rust's response to a proposal for further scientific investigation is
also typical. He writes :
" With hostile people the phenomena won't appear. I doubt very
much whether Mrs Duncan would ever again go through what she had
to endure in London. Your suggestion of the violent physical exami-
nation before and after the sittings is out of the question, and there is a
simple way out of the difficulty which is much more effective. When I
'
have time I shall make enquiries and see what can be done, if it is at all
possible and if all the people concerned will allow her."
It would be possible to fill an enormous tome with illustrations of this
type, but a very few more must suffice. The first is taken from a letter
by Neil Seath in The Tzvo Worlds in December 193 1.
It is time that those of us who have had some experience of the
remarkable manifestations obtained through Mrs Duncan rallied in
defence. . . .
42 Donald J. West [Part
" The writer, with ten friends, has had the privilege of witnessing
some of the materiaHsations. . . . The sitting took place in the home
of the sitters in a small room measuring 12 feet by 12 feet, illuminated
by a thirty watt electric red bulb. . . . Mrs Duncan was minutely
examined by two ladies well qualified for the task, and was under close
observation from the time of the examination until she was brought into
the room and placed in the cabinet in full view of everybody. . . .
" Albert requested us to observe closely, the amount of teleplasm he
would show us, and asked us to use our judgement as to whether even
Mr Harry Price could swallow and regurgitate such an amount of tele-
plasm as rapidly as it was made to appear and disappear before our
eyes. In my own judgement, the stream of teleplasm would be quite
ten feet long, and fell in several folds at the foot of one of the sitters.
It flowed with some rapidity, and disappeared almost instantly, suggesting
the swallowing powers of a crocodile. . . .
" Amongst other phenomena, Albert told us that he would endeavour
to show himself standing side by side with his medium. We heard him
request Mrs Duncan to stand up. The curtain was pulled apart, and
there in full view of us all stood the tall form of Albert, with Mrs Duncan
(shorter in stature) standing at his right side. It was a most convincing
and impressive spectacle."
Mr B. Abdy Collins, CLE., I.C.S., an S.P.R. member, has recorded^
another instance in which Albert and Mrs Duncan were seen together.
This was at Bath in December 1 93 1 , in the presence of Dr Margaret Vivian
and others, and it is of special interest because an attempt was made to
photograph the manifestation. Although the sitters were sure they could
see two figures, Mrs Duncan and Albert, the photograph showed only one
white, draped form. This is strongly suggestive of hallucination.
The next two illustrations of spiritualist testimony bear witness to how
extensive is Mrs Duncan's repertoire when in the presence of a favourable
audience. The first quotation is from some notes by Dr Reid, in the
possession of Mr Abdy Collins.
" Of all the remarkable manifestations which occurred at these Duncan
sittings—the appearance of spirit lights impressed me most. . . .
" At the very next sitting the first thing to happen was the dramatic
appearance of Albert holding a large luminous disc—about 9 inches
square. It had a dark centre from which a circle of bright rays projected
for about two inches into a surround of glowing pearl-like opalescence,
illuminating Albert's fingers as he slowly moved the object before one
sitter after another. It came within a foot of my face and seemed to
have a solid appearance—then it gradually melted away. At the same
time small sparks of light like live flies wandered about the curtains.
One of these commenced to enlarge and grow in brilliance and a beauti-
fully shaped arm and hand projecting from between the curtains was seen
to be holding it—the fingers, long and tapering, were bathed in its bluish
glow. Then it, too, slowly faded away."
' " Mrs Duncan : Enigma," (Psychic Science, Jan., 1942, vol. xx, p. 120.)
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 43
The next quotation, even more dramatic, is taken from an article by
Mr Mclndoe, one time President of the Spirituahst National Union.
" During the sittings Mrs Duncan wore a two-piece black suit pro-
vided by us, stockings, also black, and her own slippers. These clothes
she put on in an adjoining room, in the presence of Dr Hutcheson and
Mrs Drysdale, who made sure that she had no white material of any
kind, not even a handkerchief, in her possession when they brought her
into the seance room. She went immediately into the cabinet, and as
soon as she was seated the curtains were closed. . . .
" The medium was in trance almost immediately she was seated
—
as shown bv her stertorous breathing. Immediately the prayer was over
Albert said, '
Do not sing yet, Mclndoe, I am gqing to show you how
absurd this regurgitation theory is.' And there was scorn in his tones
as he spoke the last three words. '
Feel her garments, Doctor,' he said
to Dr Rust, who was seated next the cabinet to the medium's right. Dr
Rust put his hand behind the curtains.
" '
What do you mean, Albert? '
he said. '
That is her black seance
robe.'
" '
I know it is,' said Albert. '
But I want you to know that she has
it on. Feel her garments, lady,' to Mrs Drysdale, next to the cabinet at
the other side.
" '
Yes. I can feel her seance robe all right,' she replied.
" '
Now sing,' said Albert.
" Before we had sung more than two or three lines, the curtains were
parted and some things thrown straight out. They fell on me, sitting
opposite the curtain opening, not three feet from it.
" '
Mrs Duncan's clothes,' I said ; and indeed they were.
" Then the curtains were thrown wide open, not by any of the sitters.
Mrs Duncan was standing, one foot on the chair, nude, without even
her stockings, though still wearing her slippers.
" Those who knew Mrs Duncan at all intimately at that time will
appreciate that she was almost if not quite incapable of putting on her
own slippers. Certainly, inside the cabinet, she could not have removed
her rather tight-fitting seance garments, taken olT her slippers and
stockings, and replaced the slippers in an incredibly short time, without
the sitters being aware of her movements. She stood there, in trance,
white material of some sort streaming apparently from her eyes, her nose
and her mouth. It seemed a white jelly-like substance right up to the
orifices from which it seemed to be flowing. But even more weird and
fascinating was the spectacle of a liquid spurting from the nipples of her
breasts, apparently transparent as it left them, then becoming white' as it
fell, condensing into threads which somehow seemed to merge into some
sort of fabric which draped the lower part of her body and hung like a
kilt down to her knees. The two doctors peered closely at this particular
phase of the phenomena, describing and commenting on it. After a
minute or two, the curtains were closed, but were almost immediately
again thrown open revealing Mrs Duncan standing erect, facing us,
covered from head almost to feet, with a huge expanse of white material,
like an immense piece of what might quite reasonably from its appearance
44 Donald J. West [Part
be described as cheese-cloth. That material had what appeared to be
quite substantial hems along its edges. Albert made Mrs Duncan turn
round so that we could see that the material covered her back also. It
was clean whitish material, which seemed to have a faint luminosity of
its own. There was no offensive odour about it. We watched that for
a minute or two, then the curtains were closed and the seance was over."^
Prosecutions
In spite of the strength and vigour of her following, Mrs Duncan has
been twice prosecuted and convicted for fraud. The incident which led
to her first conviction took place in 1933 at a seance in Scotland. The
spirit of a little girl named Peggy, who is one of Mrs Duncan's regular
controls, materialised and came right out of the cabinet. One of the sitters.
Miss Maule, made a grab at the figure, saying, " Come here and let me
see what you are made of." Miss Maule 's hand caught and ripped some
material. The lights were switched on and the medium was discovered
trying to stuff a torn white u'ndervest up her dress. It was with difficulty
that the vest was wrested from the furious Mrs Duncan and produced in
evidence at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court. She was charged with
"... having pretended . . . that she was a medium through whom the spirits
of deceased persons were openly and regularly materialised. . .
." This
was on May 3rd 1933. She was convicted and fined /^lo. Of course,
to her supporters, she became a martyr.
The events leading to her second conviction were somewhat similar.
She was giving sittings at Portsmouth at the house of some spiritualists
by the name of Homer. The seance room was on top of a drug store run
by Mr Homer, and was registered as " The Master Temple Psychic
Centre ".
On January 14th 1944, two young naval officers, Lieutenant Worth and
Surgeon-Lieutenant Fowler, attended one of these Portsmouth seances.
There were about twenty sitters, and Worth and Fowler were placed to-
gether in the second row. Mrs Duncan's seance clothes were passed
around for inspection, and two ladies went outside to watch her dress.
In the course of the seance, Albert said, " I have here a lady who passed
over with some trouble in the lower part of her body." Worth was
prompted to ask, " Is it for me ?
" and Albert answered, " That's the
voice ". Worth repeated several times the formula " Will you come out,
please ", and then he saw a white form appear between the curtains. He
said, " Are you my aunt ?
" and the reply came in a husky whisper, " Yes ".
The figure then retired behind the curtains.^
Lieutenant Worth was disgusted. As far as he knew he had no deceased
aunt. Later in the seance another figure appeared, claiming to be his
sister ; but his only sister was at that moment alive and well. When he
disputed the identity of this figure the control said, " You don't understand,
she was premature ". Worth asserted that his mother had assured him
that she had never had a premature child.

172J The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 45
Worth got in touch with the Portsmouth pohcc after this sitting, and on
their advice he booked another two seats for a seance on January 19th.
This time Worth went in the company of War Reserve Constable Cross,
incognito, and they sat together in the second row. They allowed two
manifestations to come and go unmolested then as the third form appeared
between the curtains, Cross sprang forward, overturning Mr Homer who
was sitting in front of him, and made a determined grab. Simultaneously
Worth switched on a torch. According to their evidence, Mrs Duncan
was seen standing in front of the curtains engaged in throwing on to the
floor a sheet of flimsy white material, which was draped about her.
Cross grabbed Mrs Duncan with one hand, and the material with the
other, but the stuff was whisked away from his grasp in the direction of
the sitters. Worth's torch was jerked down by a sitter, and by the time
the electric light was switched on the white material had disappeared.
Constable Cross blew his whistle and a band of waiting policemen, led
by Inspector Ford, entered the room. The place was searched for the
cloth. The accused sitters clamoured for a search of their persons, but
the police, in spite of the presence of a woman member of the force, refused
to accede to the request, and the cloth, or whatever it was, was never found.
If a sheet of slimy, regurgitated cheese-cloth had been found, there could
hardly be a doubt in anybody's mind about the way the fraud was accom-
plished. As it was, the exposure was incomplete, and believers can still
maintain that the '
sheet '
was a genuine ectoplasmic manifestation, even
though it was used to disguise the medium. On this topic Schrenck-
Notzing has written as follows :
" The photograph (of Eva C.) ... is interesting as throwing a light on
the genesis of the so-called transfiguration, i.e., in the spiritistic sense, the
medium takes upon herself the part of the '
spirit,' endeavouring to drama-
tise the character of the person in question, by clothing herself in the
materialised fabrics. This transition stage is found in nearly all materiali-
sing mediums. The literature of the subject records a large number of
attempts at the exposure of mediums thus impersonating '
spirits ', e.g.,
that of the medium Bastian by the Crown Prince Rudolph, that of Crooke's
medium Miss Cook ; that of Mrs d'Esperance, etc. ... In all these cases
the medium was seized, but the fabrics used for masking immediately
disappeared, and were not afterwards found.
On the basis of the evidence briefly described above, Mrs Duncan, her
travelling companion Mrs Brown, and Mr and Mrs Homer were all charged
with contravening Section 4 of the Witchcraft Act by conspiring together
falsely to pretend that Mrs Duncan could get into communication with
spirits of the dead. The case was tried at the Old Bailey, before Sir Gerald
Dodson, Recorder of London, and a jury of six men and one woman.
The trial began on March 23rd 1944, and lasted over seven full days.
It created quite a stir at the time, rivalling the war news in the headlines
of the daily papers. Mrs Duncan was given a first class defence, financed by
a special spiritualist fund, but it did not succeed in procuring her acquittal.
All four defendants w-ere convicted. It was established that Mrs Duncan
had received £112 in six days for seances at Portsmouth, and she was
sentenced to nine months' imprisonment. Mrs Brown was given four
^Phenomena of Materialisation, (London, 1923), p. 97.
46 Donald J. West [Part
months, and Mr and Mrs Homer were both bound over for two years.
The case was brought before the Lord Chief Justice of England, at the
Court of Criminal Appeal, but the verdict was against the appellants.
In the course of Mrs Duncan's long defence, a host of witnesses was
called to testify to the genuineness of her materialisations. While most of
the testimony was valueless from the psychical researchers' point of view,
the narrators being obviously credulous and gullible, some was most
interesting.
Jane Rust, a retired municipal midwife, was questioned about the
Portsmouth seance of January 17th 1944 :
" O. Tell my Lord and members of the jury what happened. . . .
A. . . . the spirit guide announced that there was a gentleman there, and
he thought it was for me—an elderly gentleman—and he gave the
description. I said, '
Is it you. Daddy ?
'
meaning my husband,
and he said, '
Yes '. I invited him out and said, '
Come out
dear', and he came out.
Q. How far out of the cabinet did he come A. He came on the out-
side of the curtain. I immediately got up from my seat and went
right up to him. I said, '
Kiss me, dear '.
Q. Did you recognize anybody ? A. Of course I recognized him.
Q. Do not say, '
Of course ', I want you to tell us. A. I did, sir.
Q. Who was it ? A. My husband.
0. Had you any doubt about it being your husband ? A. No doubt
whatsoever.
Q. How close up to him were you ? A. As close as I am to this. (Indi-
cating the ledge of the witness-box.)
Q. Did he speak to you ? A. He spoke to me.
Q. Did you recognise his voice ? A. I did.
Q. Were you certain of his voice }. A. I was perfectly certain.
Q. Did he say anything to you in particular that struck you as of impor-
tance ?
A. Just spoke about the family. He said that he was always with me,
and that he would be on the other side waiting for me ; he would
never leave me until I joined him.
Q. The only thing that matters for the purposes of this case is : Are
you absolutely certain that it was your husband } A. 1 have never
been more certain of anything in my life before.
The Recorder : For how long has he been dead ? A. Five years, my Lord.
Q. Had he altered in appearance at all ? A. No, sir, he had not altered
—^just a wee bit thinner, perhaps, than he was in health, but my
husband was very ill for three years before he went.
Mr. Loseby : When your husband showed himself to you, was he as he
was—I do not know the answer to this—before, or shortly before,
he died ? A. No, he was the same as he was probably a year or
two before he died.
Q. Were you allowed to touch him ? A. 1 asked him to kiss me.
Q. Did he kiss you ? A. He said, '
Put your hand in mine, dear ', so I
gave him my right hand. He took hold of it with his right and
clasped my hand very tightly.
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 47
The Recorder : It was flesh and blood, was it ? A. It was very cold, my
Lord, but it was his hand.
O. You could hold it, could you ? A. I held it firmly. I felt the
knuckles. He suffered from rheumatism, my Lord, and I felt the
nobbly knuckles.
Mr Loseby : We must face up to things. Nurse Rust. Are you quite sure
that it was not Mrs Duncan ? A. Oh, perfectly certain, perfectly
sure. My husband is not quite so big ; he is not such a stout man.
Q. You said you asked your husband to kiss you. A. I did, sir.
Q. Did he kiss you ? A. He did, sir, right on the mouth.
This witness went on to state that at the same seance her mother mani-
fested and was recognised on close inspection by two moles, one in the
hollow of her chin and one above her left eyebrow, which were reproduced
true to life. Then an Aunt Mary came and spoke in Spanish, saying,
" I am very pleased to see you. I wanted to come before, but they did not
understand."
This evidence is extraordinary. Granting its veracity, either the witness
must have been hallucinated and deluded to an astonishing degree or else
the phenomena were genuine. It is all the more puzzling, since Mrs Rust
appeared to be a level-headed and honest narrator.
Mr. Abdy Collins has pointed out that although Mrs Rust stated in her
evidence that she was present at the seance on January 19th, when Constable
Cross seized Mrs Duncan, she is not shown as present in the oflicial plan
of the disposition of sitters at that seance.
Another interesting witness was Dr John Winning, Assistant Medical
Officer of Health of Glasgow, who said he had witnessed upwards of four
hundred materialisations at Duncan seances, many of them in his own
rooms at Glasgow. He had heard voices speak in a number of different
dialects and languages. He had clearly recognized a dozen materialised
relatives.
At the request of this Society, Dr Winning was later interviewed by
Lady Ruth Balfour, who has a medical degree and is a member of the
S.P.R. Dr Winning appeared to her to be an ardent believer in Duncan
phenomena, and who considered it an insult to question her genuineness.
He had taken photographs of some of the manifestations, and these he
showed to Lady Ruth, stressing his view that no photograph could be
judged genuine or otherwise until one took into consideration the condition
of the sitting at which it was taken. One of the photographs depicted a
tall figure, shrouded from head to foot in white drapery. The features
were indistinct, the lower half being covered by some black stuff represent-
ing a beard.- The rest of the photographs were similar to those taken
by Harry Price years previously. Dr Winning stated he was hoping to
obtain some time a photograph showing Mrs Duncan and a spirit form on
the same photograph but entirely separate from each other.
^ Op. cit., pp. 171-1J2.
^ I have seen this photograph and have no hesitation in saying that it shows
every sign of fraud. It might well be Mrs Duncan wrapped in a sheet. The
appearance of height is given by drawing the sheet high up round the neck. One
shoulder only is in view, and it might be artificially raised by Mrs Duncan's hand
beneath the sheet.—D.J.W.
48 Donald J. West [Part
It would be possible to go on quoting this sort of testimony to the crack
of doom, but we might be no nearer a conclusion at the end. It is im-
possible to come to a decision on Mrs Duncan without first deciding what
weight to attach to human testimony to physical phenomena. This is the
subject of the next section. It will suffice for the moment to cite the words
of Professor H. H. Furness of the Seybert Commission on Spiritualism.
They are very pertinent to the present issue.
" Again and again have I asked those who have returned, from an inter-
view with a spirit at the cabinet, to their seats beside me, whether or not
they had recognised their friends beyond a peradventure, and have always
received an affirmative reply, sometimes strongly affirmative. I was once
taken to the cabinet by a woman and introduced to the Shade of her dead
husband. When we resumed our seats, I could not help asking her :
'
Are you sure you recognised him ?
'
Whereupon she instantly retorted,
with much indignation, '
Do you mean to imply that I don't know my
husband ?
'
Again, at another seance, a woman, a visitor, led from the
cabinet to me a materialised spirit, whom she introduced to me as '
her
daughter, her dear, darling daughter,' while nothing could be clearer to
me than the features of the medium in every line and lineament. Again
and again, men have led round the circles the materialised spirits of their
wives, and introduced them to each visitor in turn ; fathers have taken
round their daughters, and I have seen widows sob in the arms of their
dead husbands. Testimony, such as this staggers me. Have I been
smitten with colour-blindness } Before me, as far as I can detect, stands
the very medium herself, in shape, size, form, and feature true to a line,
and yet, one after another, honest men and women at my side, within ten
minutes of each other assert that she is the absolute counterpart of their
nearest and dearest friends, nay, that she is that friend. It is as incompre-
hensible to me as the assertion that the heavens are green, and the leaves
of the trees deep blue. ..."
" In any statement of this problem we should bear in mind all the attend-
ing circumstances : the darkened room ; the music ; the singing ; the
pervading hush of expectation ; the intensely concentrated attention ; the
strained gaze at the dark cabinet and at its white-robed apparitions ; and
finally, the presence of a number of sympathising believers."^
At the Duncan trial, emphasis was laid on the way nearly all the spirits
'
dematerialised '
by sinking to the floor. In this connection also Professor
Furness' remarks are still topical.
" Not infrequently a materialised spirit is seen to subside into the floor
between the folds of the curtain at the opening of the cabinet. This is
termed '
de-materialisation ', and not a little mystery is ascribed to it.
The mystery vanishes when we reflect how easy it is for a lithe and active
young woman so to bow down quickly, even to the very ground, as to
convey the impression, when her white garments are alone visible against
a black background, that she has sunk into the floor. I have at times
distinctly felt the faint jar caused by the medium's falling backward within
the dark curtains a little too hastily. At times, when the spirit is wholly
within the cabinet, and visible only through the parted folds of the curtain,
^ Preliminary Report of the Commission appointed by the University of Pennsylvania,
etc., (Philadelphia, 1887), p. 150.
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 49
the semhlancf of a gradual sinking is obtained by simply uniting slowly the
two folds of the black curtains, beginning at the head and gradually closing
them down to the feet ; the room is generally so dark that the dark curtain
is indistinguishable at a little distance, and the effect of slowly falling is
admirably conveyed."^
Scepticism is certainly justified. It is hard to conceive the cheese-cloth
phenomena and the re-stitching of the seance garment as due to super-
normal agency. It is possible that the Duncan phenomena are only partly
fraudulent, but that hypothesis is, prima facie, less likely than that they are
all fraudulent, and there is the difficulty of how the medium knows when
to prepare for fraud and when to expect the real thing.
On the other hand, if Mrs Duncan is never genuine, one has to go to
fantastic lengths to account for all that has been observed by investigators.
Her powers of swallowing and regurgitation must be nothing short of
miraculous, and her powers of manipulation in the dark must be almost as
extraordinary, including sewing in the dark and breaking out of seals and
tapes without leaving any trace of damage.
Another possibility is that the miracle lies in the sitters and investigators,
who, once across the " enchanted boundary ", cease to observe and record
correctly. Only laboratory investigation with automatic recording instru-
ments can hope to settle the question. Perhaps even now Mrs Duncan
might be induced to sit for properly equipped investigators, this time for
the production of full blown spirit forms and not just cheese-cloth drapery.
As soon as she was released from prison, Mrs Duncan recommenced her
mediumistic activities. She refused to allow the Spiritualist National
Union to take charge of her sittings and they withdrew the diploma they
had granted her. It is reported that since then she has resorted to
advertising her wares on sandwich-boards on Blackpool Promenade. Her
recent seances are much inferior to what she used to do in her prime. Mrs
Duncan's ultimate fate is a matter for speculation.
An Enigmatic Personality.
Laying aside for the moment the question of whether Helen Duncan, or
indeed any other physical medium, has ever produced genuine phenomena,
we are left with the indisputable conclusion that she resorts on occasions
to conscious, carefully premeditated fraud. Some of the frauds were very
skilfully executed : the manipulation of the cheese-cloth phantoms and
rubber gloves, the tying up with ropes and the escape from sealed seance
garments were all very cleverly accomplished. Mrs Duncan must be a
first class artist to be able to deceive so many people for so long by these
methods.
It is difficult to reconcile this obvious skill in the art of deception with
some of the very crude methods of fraud sometimes used. One finds it
impossible to understand why she should have foisted specimens of fake
ectoplasm upon investigators who were sure to expose it, while at the same
time she was producing absolutely baffling phenomena, which, if fraudulent,
1 Ibid. pp. 152-153-
D
5° DomildJ. West [Part
must have required infinitely more subtle methods of deception. The
specimens of loaded urine, also, were utterly incongruous.
Mrs Duncan has a convincingly innocent air. People who have associated
with her a long time, and have come to believe they know her intimately,
declare her to have the appearance of a simple, truthful, honest woman.
In short, Mrs Duncan is extremely clever and cunning. (The same cannot
be said of her husband, who cheerfully asserts that his wife is fraudulent
or genuine as the occasion suits him.) But there are features in Mrs
Duncan's personality that strike one as out of place in an accomplished
charlatan.
In appearance, Mrs Duncan is far from prepossessing, being very fat
and coarse-looking with a deep red face. In speech, she has a pronounced
Scottish accent, but this is not shared by Albert. One of her most ardent
supporters describes her thus :
" She was in a brown tight-fitting dress ... a large, obese, ungainly
woman, who moved slowly as though she suifered from heart-troujjle or
glandular affection and had not to hurry. She had by no means a magnetic
personality . . . rather a repellent one that aroused one's critical faculties."^
Very far removed indeed is Mrs Duncan from her compatriot D. D.
Home, the versatile and mysterious artist, who moved so urbanely midst
the glitter and intrigue of the now extinct courts of Russia, Germany and
France. Different too from Margery Crandon, the charming and vivacious
American who mystified the scientists of a later day.
Mrs Duncan has no glamour. Put on the spot, she is apt to seek refuge
in the crudest form.s of hysteria as on the occasion when she was confronted
by Harry Price's formidable X-ray apparatus. She fled into the street,
clad in her one-piece seance suit, and clung to some railings, screaming
obscenities at the investigators and narrowly escaping arrest.
The scene must have been ludicrous indeed. A London street. In the
centre, a group of eminently respectable investigators and specialists, their
evening dress contrasting strangely with Mrs Duncan's informality of
language and attire. To complete the picture, a phlegmatic London
constable, expostulating mildly, and greatly increasing the gentlemen's
anxiety for their reputations.
When the L.S.A. came to the conclusion that she was a fraud, Mrs
Duncan indulged in what her doctor described as " an hysterical histrionic
performance ", namely swallowing half a bottle of Eusol. She was visited
by representatives of the L.S.A., who were received at her bedside with
cries, screams and threats. Although they had treated her from first to
last with the utmost consideration and generosity, Mrs Duncan lost no
time in spreading stories of how they had maltreated her.
Mrs Duncan's temper in difficult situations was never of the best.
When she was exposed at Edinburgh, she used words that were repeated
in evidence against her twenty-one years later.
" A. C. West (Chief Constable, Portsmouth) : I am coming to this point
where she uses blasphemy. When she was challenged
she said to Miss Maule :
'
I will brain you, you
bloody bugger.'
''Psychic Science, April, 1944, xxiii, p. 17.
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 51
" The Recorder : That was in 1933 ? Have there been any complamts
since ?
" West : Not as far as I am aware. I cannot rtnd any redeeming feature
in her character."^
It is extremely difficuk to reconcile all this with the high leve l of intelli-
gence and resourcefulness that she must have required for some of her
frauds. It has been suggested that Mrs Duncan is possessed of a secondary
personality, which is responsible for all her mediumistic operations. The
difficulty with this explanation is that Mrs Duncan would have to prepare
her frauds, go out and buy cheese-cloth, etc., before the sitting, while she
is presumably her normal self and not under the control of any secondary
personality. A more likely explanation v. ould seem to be that her persona-
lity is subject to some degree of dissociation at all times, but that at her
seances it is so extreme that her whole character may change from, that of
an ordinary, dull, rather clumsy woman, to a very deft and resourceful
cheat.
The truth is that Mrs Duncan is an unsolved riddle, and likelv to remain
so until we know more about physical mediums.
// THE TRIAL OF MRS DUNCAN AS A STUDY LN HUMAN
TESTIMONY.
The Duncan case is a mass of irreconcilable contradictions. An appar-
ently sane and reliable witness comes along with a tale of miracles that
makes the mind boggle, and the next moment another witness is giving
evidence of crude and common fraud. No impartial judge would pretend
to know who or what to believe.
For this reason, Mrs Duncan, like all other physical mediums of any note,
is an inscrutable enigma. Margery—after various impudent protestations
of injured innocence—passed on to join her spirit friends, taking many of
her secrets with her. Home also succeeded in carrying his cherished
mysteries safely to the grave, leaving behind several volumes of supercilious
memoirs, which, like the sphinx, remain to mock us for all time.
Mrs Duncan is unlikely to go down to posterity in the same way, but
she too can afford to laugh. The fact that she has been able to pursue
her lucrative vocation almost undisturbed for so many years, in supreme
indifference to the thoughts or opinions of psychical researchers, is just
as much a mockery of our futile attempts at investigation as the smug
reminiscences of D. D. Home.
The day of reckoning will come. When sufficient money and enterprise
are devoted to the subject, all the methods of modern instrumental controls,
including infra-red cinephotography, will be applied to the investigation
of physical phenomena. The phenomena will be lifted out of the atmo-
sphere of perpetual darkness and emotional stress, and examined in the
calm dispassionate light of day. Then there will be no more question of
genuineness. If materialisation be true, the process will be seen and
followed. If the whole thing be deception, materialisation will never be
heard of again.

When this goal is reached, either of two things may happen. If fraud
be exposed, present day critics wiU be lauded as right-minded resisters
of gross ignorance and superstition. If materialisation be vindicated,
the doubting Thomases will acquire a reputation akin to that of thei
Spanish Inquisitors. Those who have sat on the fence will be blamed inj
either event.
Until that happy time arrives, we have to depend upon the narrativesi
of witnesses, so that the degree of accuracy and reliability to be expected
from human testimony becomes a problem of immediate importance. It
is not an easy problem, since concrete assessable facts are hard to come by
and a priori opinions differ widely.
In this, as in all other psychological topics, we are apt to run into
members of the school of inveterate misanthropists. According to these
experts in the dregs of human nature, altruism is a myth, and behind the
scenes we are all slaves to the compelling impulses of crude, selfish and
amoral animal instincts. Extending this conception to human testi-
mony, they would naturally say that truth and reason in witnesses' state-
ments are only an outward fa9ade, a superficial veneer ; that in fact we
see, hear and testify only to that which satisfies our instinctive predilections.
Truthfulness is reduced to the minimum necessary to maintain an appear-
ance of consistency and plausibility. Moreover, in twisting facts to suit
their emotional preconceptions, witnesses may be completely unaware of
any deviation from the truth.
In ordinary matters these ideas might be safely rejected as far-fetched
fancies, but in the world of psychical research they are only too readily
applicable. A witness at a law court, giving an account of some familiar
domestic happening, knows he will not be believed if he says something
highly improbable ; but in describing a " psychic " phenomenon the
same witness might almost swear that the moon fell down and still be
believed by some people. The temptation to the subconscious, or what-
ever part of the personality is responsible for misstatements and fabrications,
must sometimes be irresistible.
In the observation of everyday affairs that have no special emotional
significance, the witness is on familiar ground, with all his wits about him
and his senses alert. The scope for illusion, delusion and hallucination
is relatively slight.
Very diff erently situated is the witness at a seance for physical phenomena.
Vision is obscured by darkness and the shadow of curtains. Hearing is
dulled by the monotonous discord of the sitters' vocal efforts. The sense
of touch is eliminated, as the sitter is not allowed to move about or feel
the manifestations. At the same time the atmosphere is tense and sug-
gestive, pregnant with the expectation of imminent miracles. Excitement
reaches its peak with the appearance of a spirit form, said to be the living,
tangible re-materialisation of some long decayed, worm-eaten corpse.
Recognition of features under such conditions is a risky business. While
waiting out of doors for the arrival of a friend, most people will have had
the experience of recognising in some approaching stranger the familiar
form of the expected individual, only to be disappointed on closer inspec-
tion. More serious mistakes have been made by witnesses attempting to
identify police suspects. If errors of recognition are liable to occur under
172] ,
The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan S3
:hese circumstances, they must be infinitely more common under the
;onditions of the dark seance. The relative insensibility of the fovea in-
jemi-darkness makes recognition peculiarly uncertain.
Having followed these general arguments, the reader may be in a better
position to consider some of the direct positive evidence of extensive
delusion, gross inaccuracy of observation and amazing lapses of memory
Dn the part of the sitters.
An early experimental investigation was undertaken by the S.P.R. in
1886, with the cooperation of Mr S. J. Davey, a slate-writing conjurer.
Davey gave seances for " spirit writing " in every way similar to those of
Eglinton and other mediums of the day. Some of the sitters were informed
:hat the performances were conjuring tricks, others were under the
.mpression that they were genuine spiritistic phenomena.
The sitters were asked to write careful reports shortly after each session,
while the incidents were still fresh in their memory. Their accounts were
found to contradict each other on many vital points, and some of the
writers had no doubt but that the phenomena were genuine. Davey and
Richard Hodgson, who knew the secrets of the tricks employed, were able
to expose the mistakes and inaccuracies that had led the sitters astray.
Gross errors in the appreciation of time intervals were evident, and
deceptive expressions such as " immediately " and " hardly a moment "
led to some of the worst faux pas. Failure to remember unobtrusive
'
assistance " by the conjurer in the arrangement of the slates was a very
common fault ; but there is no necessity to quote Dr Hodgson's detailed
analysis of all the errors in the accounts of these mock seances, because
anyone interested can read the full report in our Proceedings}
A somewhat similar investigation was carried out by Besterman in 1931.^
A dummy seance was held, but without a conjurer and with all the sitters
well aware that the proceedings were only for the purpose of testing their
powers of observation. A lady was posted in front of a curtained cabinet
to represent the medium. There was a table bearing miscellaneous seance-
room paraphernalia, including a trumpet and a hand-bell. Forty-two
3.P.R. members took part as sitters.
Besterman went through a prearranged routine, brightening and dimming
the lights, switching on a flashlight, answering a knock at the door, turning
1 gramophone on and off and so on. When he had finished, the sitters
were asked to answer a questionnaire relating to what they had just seen.
Thirteen sitters were discovered to be the subjects of illusions or halluci-
nations. Three of them reported non-existent movements of the table.
One referred to a candle that was not present. Tw'o sitters described the
•
hand-bell as a glass of water. Faults of omission were very common.
'
Only four people were able to describe correctly the incident in which
iBesterman opened the door in answer to a knock and then came back into
the room putting a white card in his pocket.
As Denys Parsons so aptly remarks in his excellent little article Truth
and Testimony,^ " It must be emphasised that these marked defects of
observation and memory, and the illusions, took place on occasions when

there was no suggestive atmosphere, no emotional stress, and when every
sitter was on the qui vive in expectation of the questionnaire. How much
rehance then are we to place on the statements of emotionally tense persons
sitting in dim light, in an atmosphere of religious fervour, and actuated by
the powerful desire to get in touch with their departed relatives ?
"
At actual seances delusion and deception reach an incredible peak.
Anyone who doubts it should read the book. Revelations of a Spirit
Medium} An ex-medium describes how he purchased a wire-gauze
mask, behind which he put a luminous handkerchief, so that a luminous
face was presented. " That wire mask has been recognised by dozens
as fathers, mothers, brothers, cousins, sweethearts, wives, husbands ..."
There is another book, the authenticity of which is not quite so certain,
entitled " Confessions of a Medium."- The author recounts how he was
first deceived and then taken into partnership by a famous materialising
medium. The reader is made to realise the ease with which the public
can be gulled, to understand the methods employed and to appreciate the
thrill that is experienced in applying them. Not least important among the
psychological tricks is the adoption of a false air of stupidity or simphcity.
Coming now to the Duncan trial, it is only to be expected that witnesses
should disagree and contradict each other. None the less, it is worth
tracing some of the details of the divergencies, because this is a method of
making a rough estimate of the reliability of such evidence.
It will be remembered that interest centred on two seances, on January
14th and January 19th 1944 respectively, which were attended by Lieu-
tenant Worth.
First, as to how much light there was and how distinctly the figures
could be seen. According to Worth, white forms could be discerned
between the cabinet curtains, but the features were invisible. There was
only a dark patch apparently cut away in the material which corresponded
to a face (p. 41).^
Mrs Jennings said the room was very dark and nothing could be seen
plainly. At all the various manifestations on January 14th, she saw no
features whatever (p. 97).
Worth's aunt was supposed to have materialised at this seance, and
several witnesses described her as a little old lady ; but Worth said, " I
defy anyone to say that she was a little old lady, because it was so dark
you could hardly see anything at all "
(p. 61).
Worth was flatly contradicted by Wing Commander Mackie and Mrs
Cole, both of whom were present on January 14th. Mrs Cole said the
light was sufficient to see quite plainly, and everyone in the room could
see everyone else (p. 157). Mackie claimed he could recognise the faces
of the materialisations at a distance of three or four feet. On the 14th of
January he recognised his brother, even to the tan on the face. When
giving this evidence, Mackie remarked, " I know what ridicule there is
for all these things and I know how my brother officers are going to respond
to this, but I want to have my say "
(p. 144).

Mr Homer explained that the seance room was illuminated by a 40 watt
red lamp covered with a red silk handkerchief (p. 124). '
He claimed that
at three feet distance he could see clearly. Albert's beard would be visible
from the second row of seats, some five feet from the cabinet (p. 134).-
Constable Cross, present on January 19th, said the materialised forms
were just a white blur (p. 100).
Mr Gill, questioned about the seance of January 19th, said he could see
the face of the member of the audience next but one to him on the same
row of seats, but further than that was not clear (p. 150).
Mrs Alabaster, present on January 19th, said she could recognise faces
at the opposite side of the room (p. 163).
Nurse Rust, also present on the 19th, explained that one ought to get
two feet or nearer to the figures to recognise them and see every detai
clearly (p. 178).
In view of the great differences in individual adaption to semi-darkness,
the different statements as to how much could be seen is not very good
evidence for conflicting testimony. However, it is very significant that
in the present case the degree of brightness alleged is almost an index of
belief, varving from the complete scepticism of Lieutenant Worth, who
said that hardly anything could be seen, to the faith of Mrs Cole, to whom
everything in the room was plainly visible.
One of the highlights of the prosecution was the materialisation of some
bogus relatives for Lieutenant Worth on January 14th. The episode
began by Albert announcing that there was a lady present who had passed
over with some trouble in the bowels. Mrs Homer prompted Worth to
ask, " Is it for me ?
" Albert replied, " That's the voice ", and the figure
forthwith made its appearance between the curtains.
According to Worth, it was a bulky form shrouded in white right down
to the ground (p. 42). Urged to speak up, he asked, " Are you my aunt ?
"
The figure said " Yes ", although Lieutenant Worth's aunts were all living.
The supposed aunt immediately retired behind the curtains. That was
all that was said and nothing more could be seen.
Homer's testimony was completely different. He described V/orth's
aunt as a slim old lady, about 5 ft. i in. in height, who came some three
or four feet from the cabinet. Her features could be seen clearly. She
had a very old face with a pointed chin and her hair was greying (p. 127).
Worth, according to Homer, asked, " Are you an aunt of mine }
" The
•old lady replied, " Trying to act strange, are you not ?
" She then disap-
peared down through the floor and not behind the curtain (p. 128). When
she had gone Albert said, " I have a sailor boy here ". "I know no
sailor
'
'
Worth replied. There was no materialisation and Albert reminded
Worth that there was no rank and file in the spirit world. This remark
was taken as a rebuke to Worth for being too proud to acknovdedge a
common sailor.
Worth denied the incident about the sailor (p. 60), but all the defence
witnesses who were questioned on the point remembered it and confirmed
Homer's account. They included Wing Commander Mackie (p. 145),
Mrs Cole (p. 156), Mrs Taylor (p. 181), Mrs Tremlett (p. 188), and Mrs
Jopling (p. 195).
Mrs Cole's evidence as to the aunt agreed with Homer's and contradicted
56 Donald J. West [Part i
Worth's. She claimed that the figure came right out of the cabinet, looked i
Worth in the face and said, " Trying to be strange "
(p. 156).
Mrs Irene Taylor described the figure as an oldish lady, rather thin and i
bent, with long features, who came out of the cabinet and peered right into
Worth's face (p. 181).
Mrs Tremlett asserted that a woman came out of the cabinet and Worth
asked if she were his aunt. She replied, " You are acting strangely ". I
Then she just disappeared from where she was standing, right away from
the cabinet (p. 188).
Mrs Jopling also remembered the aunt who had said, " You are acting
strangely, are you not ?
" The figure then sank to the floor. She had not j
come very far from the curtains (p. 195). I
On the question of Worth's aunt, the believers were in agreement with
each other and in unanimous opposition to Worth. This might be simply
a case of lying by one or both sides, but that need not necessarily be the
explanation. It seems highly probable that what is seen and remembered
of these seances depends on what one believes to start with, in which case
witnesses could be perfectly honest and still contradict each other. All the
same, if nothing of the kind had occurred, it is strange that several witnesses
should all see the form of an old lady come out and peer into Worth's face.
It is also odd that witnesses should agree in ascribing the same, or almost ,
the same remark to the alleged spirit. j
Worth maintained that after the aunt had gone Albert said, " Here is a |
gentleman who passed away with some trouble to his chest ". A white
shrouded figure with no describable lines about it then appeared before the
curtams. Not knowing what to say he asked, " Are you my uncle }
"
The voice replied, " Yes." The figure gave a nondescript salute and
disappeared (p. 42).
None of the defence witnesses remembered Worth's alleged uncle. Both
Homer and Mrs Tremlett denied all knowledge of the incident, although
they were able to give a full account of Worth's other communicators
(pp. 127, 192). Neither Mrs Taylor nor Mrs Jopling mentioned Worth's
uncle in their accounts of his communicators.
The next manifestation began with Albert saying, " I have here for the
same gentleman his sister " ; Worth said, " I have no sister ", and the
voice rephed, " Perhaps you don't understand, but she was premature."
Worth said he was quite sure there were no premature children in his
family, but the voice answered, " You can ask the question ". No form
'
materialised.
For a wonder, all the other witnesses are in agreement with Worth as to
the general substance of this verbal exchange, which rather suggests that
hearing is less readily deceived than sight.
Ahhough a great deal of attention was paid to Worth's experiences on
January 14th, the real crux of the case against Mrs Duncan lay in the alleged I
exposure of January 19th. At _the seance on this date. War Reserve I
Constable Cross was sitting next' to Lieutenant Worth in the second row
of seats. The seance was not allowed to continue for long. When the
third form appeared, Cross jumped out of his seat and made a grab at it.
According to Cross' own description of what took place, he overturned
the chair in front of him, on which Mr Homer was sitting, and sprang
'
172] The Trial of Mrs Helot Duncan 57
forwards. Simultaneously Worth switched on a torch, exposing Mrs
Duncan standing between the curtains in the act of hurriedly trying to
push a piece of white material, which was draped in front of her, down to
the floor. When he reached Mrs Duncan, Cross seized her by the arms.
She stepped a little to one side, and Cross, still holding her with his right
hand, bent down and grasped the white material with his left hand. It
felt flimsy, like butter-muslin. He grasped it for a moment, and then it
was pulled out of his grasp in the direction of the left of the front row of
the audience (pp. loo-ioi).
Cross stood up again, pulled the curtains apart and exposed the empty
cabinet. Mrs Duncan was then seated in a chair outside the cabinet (p. 105).
Worth corroborated Cross' testimony. He too had seen the standing
figure of Mrs Duncan trying to dispose of the cloth. Someone in the
audience tried ineffectually to knock his torch away. As he redirected it
on to the scene, someone in the front row was pulling the cloth out of the
constable's grasp. Cross cried, " Did you get the cloth ?
" " No, it has
gone into the audience ", repHed Worth. " Of course it has gone, it had
to go somewhere ", commented the enigmatical Mrs Duncan (pp. 53, 67).
Mrs Duncan was standing in her bare feet. She bent down and put on
her shoes, which were on the floor behind her, and then sat down.
According to Homer, a brilliant torch suddenly shone upon the " spirit
friend " who had materialised in the centre of the cabinet. The next
moment he was knocked off his chair and fell sprawling on the floor, from
which vantage point the exciting events higher up were lost to him. By
the time Homer got back to another seat, Mrs Duncan was sitting on an
upturried chair outside the cabinet. Constable Cross was very nervous
and agitated. He glared and said, " Sit down. Homer ", when Homer
made to go to Mrs Duncan's assistance (p. 131).
Mr Gill, who was sitting on Homer's left, said that Cross dived forwards,
clawed the curtains and fell through into the cabinet on top of Mrs Duncan,
who could be seen sitting in her chair. The spirit form vanished down
through the floor as Cross came forward. Cross got up and pulled Mrs
Duncan out of her chair into the room. (No mean feat in view of their
respective sizes.) He seemed scared (p. 148).
Mrs Gill, who sat on Homer's right, said that a boy materialised and
came out of the cabinet. He then disappeared, all but a small piece of
ectoplasm about the size of a pocket handkerchief to be seen on the floor.
The next thing. Constable Cross leapt forward. Thinking he was ill and
wanted to get out, Mrs Gill took hold of his arm, but he went straight on,
clinging at the curtains and sprawling over Mrs Duncan. He could be
seen with legs stretched out, one on either side of Mrs Duncan who was
sitting in the cabinet. Mrs Gill cried out, " Oh, don't do it ", and rushed
into the cabinet after the policeman, throwing her arms round his waist.
She then felt that they had all stood up and taken a turn, and she found
herself holding Mrs Duncan, who was on an upturned chair, outside the
cabinet (p. 152).
This evidence is curious. Mr Gill mentioned that his wife had grabbed
hold of Cross as he sprang forwards, but neither he nor any of the other
witnesses mentions anything about seeing her on top of the pile of bodies
in the cabinet.
58 Donald J. West [Part
Mrs Alabaster, next but one on Homer's left, saw a man rush forward
and make a grab at a disappearing spirit form. She heard the curtains
drawn apart, and looking into the cabinet she saw Mrs Duncan lolling in
her chair. This statement seems entirely contrary to the evidence stating
that Cross fell straight through the curtains on top of the medium. Mrs
Alabaster went on to say that Cross pulled at Mrs Duncan's chair. There
was a scuffle, and at the end of it Mrs Duncan was sitting outside the
cabinet on an upturned chair with one shoe off.
Mr Coulcher, who sat at the end of the row on Mrs Alabaster's left,
saw Cross dart out and claw at the curtains. The spirit form vanished
instantly down through the floor. A light was flashed and the next moment
Mrs Duncan was outside the cabinet on an upturned chair with one shoe
off (p. 167).
Nurse Rust saw Cross jump out on to a spirit form which vanished
through the floor. There was nothing left to grasp and Cross clutched
at the curtains and fell through into the cabinet. Mrs Duncan's chair
was dragged away from the corner, and she was found sitting with one
shoe off just within the cabinet. This is the only witness who said that
Mrs Duncan was still in the cabinet.
Once again we find two schools, prosecution and defence, diametrically
opposed to each other. Unfortunately this is a common feature of court
cases, and need not be due to the allegedly psychic nature of the events.
It will be noted that the prosecution maintains a high degree of self-
consistency, whereas the defence witnesses flounder somewhat. However,
we know that considerable confusion is only to be expected of genuine
witnesses at Duncan phenomena.
At the seance of January 14th, which ran its course undisturbed, there
were a great many materialisations, and we will close by noting a few of
the more outstanding of these phenomena.
Mrs Barnes described how her father, who had been in the Madras
police force, materialised a yard away from her. On his head was a white
tropical helmet with a red band, which of course appeared black (p. 199).
By this statement the witness apparently intended to convey that she
presumed that the band was red, as in life, but that under the lighting
conditions of the seance it seemed black. If the red light were really
not strong enough to show up a red colour, it must have been very dim
indeed.
Mrs Jopling agreed that there was a foreign-looking white helmet with
a dark band (p. 198).
Worth said that Mrs Homer exclaimed, " Look at the Helmet ", which
he did as hard as he could, but there was nothing to be seen (p. 47).
Homer saw a white helmet, like a topee (p. 129).
Mackie thought the figure was wearing an ordinary blue policeman's
helmet (p. 147).
Mrs Sullivan said it was a dark helmet, but not of English style (p. 180).
Mrs Barnes gave an account of a second materialisation, this time of her
granddaughter, Shirley. This was a little girl, some three feet high, who
came out to the extreme left of the curtains. She stood a foot away and,
taking hold of Mrs Barnes' hand, recited, " This little piggy . .
." in a baby
voice (p. 199).
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 59
All the defence witnesses were agreed on these points. Homer said he
saw the child clearly. She was about three feet high and took hold of
Mrs Barnes' fingers as she recited, " This little piggy went to market . .
."
Mrs Cole said the same (pp. 129, 155). Mrs Sullivan had noticed the
baby fingers (p. 179). Mrs Tremlett said the child was about three years
of age (p. 189). In defiance of all these witnesses, Worth swore he remem-
bered no such incident (p. 63).
Another supposedly girlish manifestation was Mrs Duncan's guide
Peggy. Worth described her as a bulky, white-shrouded figure that came
out of the cabinet and jumped about (p. 45).
Dr Fowler, one of the prosecution witnesses, was more interesting. He
said Peggy was a white form about five feet high. He could not see her
very well or tell how bulky she was, because the forms had a habit of
pulling out the curtains with them, so concealing part of their figure. The
curtains were draped in front of the figures, and if wide open the manifes-
tation seemed bulky, but if the curtains were drawn closer together it
appeared slim (p. 73).
Mrs Jennings, a prosecution witness, admitted that Peggy came right
outside the cabinet and danced about, but the room was very dark and it
might have been Mrs Duncan impersonating a slim young girl (p. 98).
Mrs Tremlett said she saw Peggy clearly as a young girl, about eighteen
to twenty, not particularly fat (p. 189).
Thus, once again, and for the last time, we have traced the whole gamut
of possibilities, from the witness who steadfastly heard and saw nothing,
through the more doubtful witnesses, right down to those out and out
believers to whom everything was as clear as noonday, every face was
recognisable, and every detail vividly remembered.
Without the example of the trial before us, it would have been hard to
believe that honest witnesses could be so biased in their observations. In
circumstances of excitement, accident, unexpected happenings, etc., com-
plete coincidence of testimony and awareness of detail is not to be expected.
Our experience of everyday life in such circumstances show that the human
mind is not constituted to be aware of minor details. Only the salient
fact, with a minimum amount of detail, is remembered. Cross-examina-
tion demonstrates that different witnesses to the same situation take in
different items and remember different details afterwards.
In the conditions of Mrs Duncan's seances, with the sitters emotionally
implicated, the correct answer to a majority of the questions put by
Counsel at the trial should have been, " I don't know, I did not notice
that point ". The fact that, on the contrary, defence witnesses coincided
in detailed evidence favouring the Defence, and prosecution witnesses
coincided in detailed evidence favouring the Prosecution, gives us a forcible
object lesson of how little the human mind in such circumstances is dis-
passionate and unbiased. No doubt the witnesses at the trial felt them-
selves to be giving honest evidence, but all the same their testimony was
almost entirely governed by previous bias.
Anyone wanting further evidence of human fallibility will find plenty
more illustrations in this informative book The Trial of Mrs Duncan.
6o Donald J. West [Part
///. THE LAW RELATING TO PSYCHIC PHENOMENA.
The Treatment of Mediums.
Before plunging into the perilous morass of legal theory, we might first
consider the Duncan trial as a purely practical illustration of the treatment
a medium and her associates may expect to receive at the hands of the law
of the present day.
The spiritualists lent Mrs Duncan every support in her legal battle.
Never before had a medium been tried before such high authorities, and
the spiritualists were naturally anxious to see how she would fare. They
made her trial a test case, hoping for a successful issue that would establish
a favourable precedent.
Judge and counsel at the trial were experts of high standing, so we must
presume that as a piece of legal investigation it was a model of judicial
fairness. As laymen we are not competent to express any other opinion,
but as psychical researchers, with standards of evidence peculiar to our-
selves, we are entitled to contrast our own methods of judging psychic
phenomena with those of the law.
In the first place, in psychical investigations, it is usually the medium
alone who stands to suffer after an exposure ; but when Mrs Duncan was
tackled by the law three other people were charged with her on grounds
of conspiracy. They were Mrs Brown, the medium's travelling companion
and Mr and Mrs Homer, the spiritualists who employed Mrs Duncan.
All were found guilty. Mrs Brown's guilt was established mainly on the
grounds that she was present as Mrs Duncan's friend and showed some
of the visitors spirit photographs of a type the police were able to imitate.
Mr and Mrs Homer brought to the court receipts to show that money left
over from the takings of the seances was given to charity. Mrs Homer's
chief crimes were encouraging the sitters to speak up and making remarks
upon the wonder of the '
phenomena '. The couple were by all accounts
sincere spiritualists and respectable citizens, but in the eyes of the law
they were guilty of conspiracy and must have known Mrs Duncan was a
fraud.
Neither Mrs Duncan, nor Mrs Brown, nor Mrs Homer elected to go
into the witness-box to give evidence in their own defence, but Mrs
Duncan's counsel called witnesses to try to prove that she had been a
genuine medium before and after the 19th of January 1944. The judge
decided that this was putting Mrs Duncan's character in evidence and that
the jury had therefore a right to know about her previous conviction at
Edinburgh (p. 265). He also refused to admit the evidence of alleged
test seances held after February 29th 1944, the date on which the accused
were committed (p. 236).
The main evidence against Mrs Duncan was the testimony of Lieutenant
Worth and Constable Cross. Great emphasis was placed on Worth's
description of the bogus aunt and the non-existent sister who appeared to
him on January 14th. We have noted in the last section how widely
Worth's version of this episode differed from the descriptions of the defence
witnesses. His statements remained totally unconfirmed^ because the
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan
legal experts failed to question his companion, Surgeon-Lieutenant
Fowler, on any of the essential points.
As a witness. Worth was not entirely satisfactory. He admitted to
deliberately deceiving the Homers into thinking he was convinced. He
had told them that the sitting of the 14th was " amazing "
(p. 54). In
giving evidence he said he had rung up his mother and confirmed the
spirit message about a premature sister. Later on he had to admit in
actual fact his mother had had no premature child and was not even on
the telephone. When first questioned, Worth also said he had only been
carrying out police instructions, but later he recanted again and confessed
to acting on his own initiative (p. 70).
Even if we accept Worth's testimony without dispute, there still seems
nothing in it to prove fraud when the evidence is considered from the
psychical research standpoint. Poor quality communications are not
proof of fraud, and in any case the communications have little to do with
the nature of the materialisations, which was the main point at issue.
The suggestion of the prosecution was that the materialisations were Mrs
Duncan wrapped in a sheet. Cross claimed to have seen and touched
this sheet when he pounced on Mrs Duncan at the seance of January 19th,
but the alleged sheet was not found and no systematic search of the sitters
was made. Much of the evidence of the defence was utterly at variance
with the sheet hypothesis. Mrs Duncan was proffered for the purpose of
a test seance in court, so that the jury could see the materialisations for
themselves. The judge first of all said he would not allow the jury to be
troubled with a matter of that sort. Later he asked the jury if they wished
to have the opportunity of witnessing such a demonstration. They replied
that they did not (p. 305).
With our experience as psychical researchers, and with the whole of Mrs
Duncan's chequered histor}' before us, we have some right to doubt the
accuracy of the witnesses to her genuineness. Little of this information
was officially available to the court, and it is a problem how without it
they were able to come to the decision to over-rule the evidence for the
defence. One cannot help but feel that their verdict may have been largely
decided on a^non grounds, or, in common parlance, by personal prejudice.
It is no secret that the police rarely take action against spiritualist
mediums unless they become a public nuisance, or unless a member of
the public registers an ofiiciaI\;omplaint against them. In the case of Mrs
Duncan, it came out that at one of her seances she or her spirits had
revealed the sinking of a British warship before its loss had been officially
disclosed (p. 337). Were this the true complaint, it is a pity she was not
tried on another charge.
The Word of the Law.
There are two acts in the Statute Book of direct concern to everyone
interested in psychic phenomena. They are the Witchcraft Act of 1735
(9 Geo. 2, c. 5) and the Vagrancy Act of 1824, 2 (5 Geo. 4, c. 83) with its
subsequent amendments. As British Law presumes itself known to all,
we had better be familiar with the provisions of these acts, if only for our
own protection.
62 Donald J. West [Part
The tone of the Vagrancy Act has all the obnoxiousness of the old
" Poor Laws ". It was introduced for the swift and certain punishment
of idle and disorderly persons. A whole list of ofl'ences is covered by the
Acts, including obscenely exposing the person in a public place, procuring
alms by the exhibition of deformities, a male person living on the proceeds
of prostitution, being armed with an offensive weapon with intent to
commit a felony, etc. etc.
Every member of the public has the right to apprehend and deliver into
the hands of the police any person found offending against the Act. Any
vehicle or personal effects in the offender's possession may be taken into
custody with him and searched. Any money found on him may be used
to pay the expenses of the arrest and the cost of maintaining the offender
until the time of committal. If his cash is insufHcient for the purpose,
the police can sell his belongings.
Once charged as a rogue and vagabond under the Vagrancy Act, the
offender can be dealt with summarily in a magistrate's court. He is liable
for up to three months' imprisonment and is not allowed the right of trial
by jury. Once convicted, his name is placed for all time on the list of
" rogues and vagabonds ".
For a second offence under the Act, the offender can be tried again at
a Court of Petty Sessions without a jury, but he must wait for the next
Quarter Sessions for his sentence of one year's imprisonment and a
whipping. The Spiritualists are not the only people who have sought for
a revision of the Vagrancy acts.^
The clause by which mediums are classed as rogues and vagabonds reads
as follows :
" Every person pretending or professing to tell fortunes, or using any
subtle craft, means or device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and
impose on any of his Majesty's subjects."
Mediums are not specifically mentioned in the wording of the clause,
but it has been held to include them by a decision of the High Court of
Justice in 1877 ^^e appeal of a medium named Monck. Monck, who
had been charged under the Vagrancy Act, appealed on a point of law.
The accident of a deficiency of judges in the Divisional Court of Appeal
was the cause of the case being heard in High Court. Monck claimed
that his mediumistic demonstrations did not come under the jurisdiction
of the Act, but his appeal was quashed on the grounds that the words
" subtle craft " included supposed communication with spirits.
Efforts have been made to relieve spiritualists and mediums from prose-
cutions under the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Acts, but so far without success.
In 1930 a Bill entitled the Spiritualism and Psychical Research Exemption
Bill was discussed in the House of Commons. It Vv'as ordered to be
brought in by a number of supporters of the spiritualist' case, among them
being Sir Ernest Bennett, Mr Oliver Baldwin, Mr D. G. Somerville, and
Miss Wilkinson. But it failed to attract sufficient attention and was finally
dropped.
Under this Bill no person was to be prosecuted or convicted under the
Statutes relating to witchcraft or vagrancy in respect of any act done or
words spoken in the promulgation or exposition of the teachings of
'
See, for instance, Justice in England, by a barrister, (London), 1938.
172] The Trial of Mrs Helen Duncan 63
spiritualism, or in the pursuit of psychical research. Thus promoters,
chairmen, lecturers, clairvoyants and mediums were to be protected, but
any immunity was not to apply where intention to defraud was proved.
Mediums and clairvoyants were defined as persons holding a certiiicate or
" licence of fitness to practise," such certificates to be issued by " registered
or properly constituted spiritualistic or psychical societies, or such other
certifying or licensing body " as might be approved by one of His Majesty's
Principal Secretaries of State.
The Spiritualists' National Union have also made attempts to obtain
some modification of the Vagrancy Act in its application to mediums. A
deputation to the Home Office in 1930 included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
Hannen Swaffer and the Rev C. Drayton Thomas. Another in 1943 had
Mr Loseby, barrister, as chief spokesman, and included Lord Dowding
and Dr S. J. Peters, M.P. They failed to secure any amendment to the
Vagrancy Act, but in November 1943 Mr Morrison, at that time Home
Secretary wrote to Dr Peters as follows :
" I appreciate, however, the feelings of spiritualists on this subject, and
I have made enquiries as to prosecutions under this Act. I understand
that it is the practice in some Police Forces in cases of this kind to institute
proceedings only against persons whose activities have been the subject of
complaint by members of the public, and where there is evidence that the
person is an impostor and taking money or other valuable consideration.
Although I have no power to issue any directions to the police as to the
manner in which they should enforce the law, I have asked the Chief
Constables to consider the adoption of this practice in their Forces. Fur-
ther than this I cannot go, but, if the practice I have described is generally
adopted, persons bona fide engaged in the ministrations of the spiritualist
churches and in psychical research should not find themselves hampered
by the provisions of the law."^
With this semi-assurance they and we must rest content.
The Witchcraft Act of 1735 repeals the previous Act of King James the
First against Conjuration and Witchcraft. It forbids proceedings against
any person or persons for witchcraft, sorcery, inchantment, or conjuration,
and goes on :
" And for the more eff^ectual preventing and punishing of any Pretences
to such Arts or Powers as are before mentioned, whereby ignorant
persons are frequently deluded and defrauded ; be it further enacted by
the Authority aforesaid. That if any Person shall, from and after the said
Twenty-fourth Day of June, pretend to exercise or use any kind of Witch-
craft, Sorcery, Inchantment, or Conjuration, or undertake to tell Fortunes,
or pretend, from his or her Skill or Knowledge in any occult or crafty
Science, to discover where or in what Manner any Goods or Chattels,
supposed to have been stolen or lost, may be found " they shall be guilty
of an offence against the Act. The penalty is a year's imprisonment.
We may note in passing the specific reference to finding lost articles by
psychic means, a feat that has been recorded many times in the annals of
psychical research.
Mrs Duncan was tried under the Witchcraft Act on a charge of conspiracy
* See " Report of the Deputation from the Spiritualists' National Union to the
Home Office ", (Manchester), 1944, p. 16.
^4 Donald J. West [Part 172]'
to pretend to exercise or use a kind of conjuration. Sir Gerald Dodson
was at pains to explain that the emphasis was on the word " pretend ".
The Lord Chief Justice, Viscount Caldecote, made the same point in his
judgement on the appeal (pp. 321, 348). Presumably if Mrs Duncan's
materialisations had been considered genuine, and not a pretence, they
would not have constituted an offence, although this was not stated in so
many words.
The grounds of Mrs Duncan's appeal included one important point of
law, namely whether the word " conjuration " in the Act applied only to
personal conference with the Devil or Evil Spirits (p. 347). It was decided
that the word had a wider meaning and applied to converse with any kind
of spirit. The appeal was quashed.
Possibly as a result of the publicity given to the Duncan trial, questions
were asked in the House of Commons on May 3rd 194s regarding the law
relating to the activities of spiritualist mediums. Mr' Herbert Morrison
replied that, while he had no power to determine questions of law, he had
been advised that the provisions of the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Acts
made it quite clear that the mischief aimed at was fraud and imposture
He reaffirmed that the police had been advised by the Home Office to
mstitute proceedings only where there is sufficient evidence that the person
is an impostor.
In reply to a question by Mr Montague, the Home Secretary said he
had been advised that it was not criminal to undertake spiritualist seances.
The Lord Chancellor had written to Lord Dowding expressing that view.
This very rough survey of the state of the law with regard to psychic
phenomena brings to a close our resume of the main points raised by Mrs
Duncan and her sensational trial.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE
SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
PART 173
THE MODUS OPERANDI OF PARANORMAL COGNITION
ABSTRACT
The object of this paper is twofold. It is in the first place an attempt to
deduce something of the nature of paranormal cognition from an examina-
tion of the collected evidence, and secondly to show that the completely
controlled type of experiment is misleading if employed alone. The
reason for the latter is that experiments in paranormal cognition, if
controlled as rigidly as in physical science, and if amenable to statistical
treatment, must make use of extremely restricted events, such as card-
guessing. Such events serve to demonstrate the existence of paranormal
cognition, and to show certain of its minor features, but not to elucidate
its nature : they are too devoid of qualitative content. It is here pointed
out that by selecting their evidence, workers in the field of statistical
experiment have reached erroneous conclusions ;
and the plea is put
forward that theoretical conclusions should not be based on selected
evidence but on all the evidence treated impartially.
If the material quoted, and its significance, has been dealt with at some
length, this is because it was felt that the points arising in an issue of such
importance for psychical research must be made abundantly clear.
The method of approach here used to the problems of paranormal
cognition is different from that now in vogue. It points to the conclusions
(i) that paranormal cognition is known to consciousness only by means of
an entirely secondary phenomenon, (2) that it is not a faculty akin to sense-
perception, and (3) that experiment in a neglected field is needed to reveal
more of its nature.
A suggested experimental programme is briefly summarised at the end
of the paper.
This Society has now carried on its work for sixty-four years, and it is
natural to ask what progress has been made towards establishing an under-
standing of the faculty which was at first called " thought-transference ",
and later " telepathy ", and which has now been subsumed, together with
the faculties called " clairvoyance " and " precognition ", under the term
" extra-sensory perception ".
The term, " extra-sensory perception ", which was proposed by Prof.
J. B. Rhine, is written with a hyphen between the words " extra " and
" sensory ". This suggests a faculty akin to sense-perception, though
beyond it. It suggests, in fact, that we know that this faculty can properly
E .65
66 The Modus Operandi of [Part
be called " perception ", and in this, I think, we are allowing assumption
to outrun evidence. On the other hand, if the hyphen he placed between
the words " sensory " and " perception ", the term implies no more than
that we are dealing with something which is beyond sense-perception.
It gives no hint as to what that " something " is ; and the title becomes
unnecessarily negative. For this reason I have preferred to speak of
" paranormal cognition " rather than of " extra-sensory perception " or
" extra sensory-perception ". But even this title is not altogether satis-
factory, for sometimes it is paranormal action or paranormal feeling with
which we have to do rather than with paranormal cognition. Moreover, it
may be doubted whether the whole of the phenomenon can properly be
called " paranormal ".
Dr R. H. Thouless, with Dr B. P. Wiesner, has proposed the term
" psi-phenomena ", which has the advantage of avoiding the word
" perception " ; but I believe that he intends this term to apply to a wider
range of phenomena than that covered by paranormal cognition. On the
whole, the latter seems to me, for the present purpose, to be the best term
to use.
If progress is to be made towards understanding something of the nature
of paranormal cognition, and if we are to avoid blind alleys and false and
misleading hypotheses, it is absolutely essential that all the relevant
material should be examined. Assumptions should not be made unless
checked against all the available evidence. Reference to our Proceedings
shows that this kind of critical examination was made more often in the
earlier days of the Society than it is to-day. For example, Mrs Sidgwick's
paper On the Evidence for Clairvoyance was published in 1891 ; her paper
On the Evidence for Premonitions in 1888 ; On the Trance Phenomena of
^
Mrs Piper between 1908 and 191 1 ; F. W. H. Myers's paper On the
Subliminal Self before 1901 ; Edmund Gurney's work on Hypnotism,
Telepathy and Apparitions before his death in 1888. Attempts of this
kind to extract the significance of the collected evidence by critical analysis
are far fewer in later volumes of the Proceedings. A new technique has
been introduced in recent years, that of the experiment which can be
completely controlled and statistically evaluated. This has been designed
to render psychical research more " objective ". It is all to the good as
far as it goes ; but unfortunately those who pursue it have neglected to
compare their results with past work or to apply critical analysis of the
above kind. Workers in statistical experiments assume that they have
made a new start—and that the previous work was only preliminary and
need not be taken into account either in planning further experiments or
in formulating hypotheses. To what erroneous conclusions this attitude
can lead will be shown presently. It is a mistake to think that psychical
research can be carried out in sections and that the investigator can build a
comprehensive hypothesis based on one section of the evidence only,
while ignoring the rest. Also, in my view, it is necessary in this subject
not only to examine the whole of the evidence but also to step frequently
outside the laboratory and survey the whole field of the paranormal in
order to get one's perspective right. The extent to which workers in
statistical research have ignored other evidence is shown in certain recent
publications. v
173] Paranormal Cognition 67
For example, in the book entitled Extra-Sensory Perception after Sixty
Years (1940) by Prof. J. B. Rhine, J. G. Pratt, Burke M. Smith, C. E.
Stewart and J. A. Greenwood, bearing the sub-title, A Critical Appraisal
of the Research in Extra-Sensory Perception, only 2\ pages out of 409 are
devoted to spontaneous cases of extra-sensory perception, and only one
page to experimental work of a non-statistical kind. All the rest of the
book is devoted to a discussion of evidence derived from the statistical
type of experiment. Mr Whately Carington published in 1945 a book
entitled Telepathy, bearing as its sub-title An Outline of its Facts, Theory
and Implications. Seven pages out of 170 are devoted to spontaneous
cases and none at all to non-statistical experiment. He also propounds in
this book a theory of telepathy based almost entirely on the results of
statistical experiments, and appears to be unaware that these experiments
do not reveal the most important features of telepathy.
It is necessary here to make a somewhat tiresome digression in order to
justify the use of the term " statistical experiment ". It has been pointed
out that there is in theory no " statistical method " of experiment in the
sense of a separate principle of research which alone makes use of statistics.
Statistics are applied wherever they are needed, and they are particularly
needed in dealing with chance-coincidence. This is quite true in general.
But in psychical research the most important phenomena are not of a
nature which lend themselves to statistical treatment, because they concern
the spontaneous behaviour of human beings, and their essential charac-
teristics are qualitative. If statistics are to be applied to coincidences in,
the field of psychical research, this involves the selection of paranormal
events to which statistics can be applied ; and so long as the investigators
insist on applying statistics, they limit themselves to an examination of these
events. Experiments made with these restricted events lead to different
conclusions about the nature of paranormal cognition from the conclusions
pointed to by less restricted paranormal events, and the experimenter who
attempts to theorise on the basis of statistical experiments alone is likely
to be misled. This will be demonstrated later. My point for the moment
is that it is legitimate, as well as convenient, to speak of " statistical
experiments " because they stand apart as a class on account of the fact
that the events they comprise have been chosen in order to suit a pre-
determined method of research.
I shall now consider what light the evidence in general throws on the
nature of paranormal cognition.
The Relation of Paranormal Cognition to Consciousness
The first thing to be noticed is that paranormal cognition is not a con-
scious process. No percipient of telepathy, clairvoyance or precognition,
so far as I can gather, has ever been consciously aware of a telepathic,
clairvoyant or precognitive process at work within him. No one has been
able to say : Now I am conscious that a telepathic message is coming to
me from origin X ; or : Now I am aware of the process of clairvoyantly
perceiving an object Y ; or : Now I am conscious that knowledge of a
future event Z is reaching me. It is always the product and never the
process of paranormal cognition of which the subject is aware. In this
68 The Modus Operandi of [PariI
respect paranormal cognition resembles normal sense-perception and also
memory. ,
Perhaps some percipients, if asked, would at first be inclined to claim'
awareness of the process ; but I do not think they would persist in this
claim when once they had grasped the difference between process and
product.
If it be agreed that there is valid evidence for paranormal cognition
and if It be also agreed that the process of paranormal cognition is not
open to conscious inspection, it follows that that process does not take
place in consciousness. It takes place, therefore, outside consciousness •
that is to say, in the language of psychical research, it takes place in the
subliminal self ". I have heard this referred to as an " assumption "
and as
a speculation " ; but what other conclusion is possible?
What is it, then, in a case of paranormal cognition, which takes place in
consciousness.? It is awareness of the product of the paranormal cognitive
process.
The Principle of Mediation
If we approach paranormal cognition from the angle adopted in this
paper, two important facts strike us at the outset, (i) The product of the
paranormal cognitive process is not paranormal, (ii) The product of the
paranormal cognitive process is also the product of cognitive and other
processes which we are not in the habit of calling paranormal These
statements will be best understood in the light of a few examples I will
deal with the second statement first.
I. Normal Cases. An instructive case is that of Mr A. {Proc xviii 7o8)
Though normal in every other respect, Mr A. had very bad eyesight
One day, while walking along a country road, he saw the stone wall
beside the road with extraordinary clearness, each separate stone being
visible with the mortar between the joints. Here and there broken
granite stones showed felspar and quartz reflected in the sun's rays Mr A
thought he had never seen a wall so minutely before. When he came to a
part of the road where there was no wall in reality but only an iron railing
he still saw the wall, but he did not see the railing. Then he shut his eyes
and found that he continued to see the wall with the sun shining on it
just as clearly as before. Presently the wall disappeared from his visual
held ;
but flowers and various coloured designs took their place, and these
visual hallucinations lasted for some days. Then they ceased but
returned the next year. These visual hallucinations had two m'arked
characteristics : they were extremely bright, being almost luminous •
and they were quite clear, having none of the haziness which marred
Mr A. s normal vision.
I do not wish to enter into problems of sense-perception, which properly
belong to the fields of philosophy and psychology ; but I would stress the
view that the cause of Mr A.'s visions, whatever it may have been lav
entirely within Mr A. himself. The objective part of Mr A 's vis'ions
had no physical existence in the space surrounding him ; neither had the
visions any cause residing in external space. The cause of them lay within
the totality of Mr A.'s psycho-physical personality.
jy^] Paranormal Cognition 69
Perhaps the word " hallucination " should not be applied to such com-
pletely constructed visions as these. It may be that, following '
Prof
H. H. Price's suggestion {Perception, p. 198), they should rather be called
" apparitions ". But the apparitions I shall have to deal with m the
examples following have varying degrees of perfected constructability and
varying kinds of externality, and it will be more convenient to call these
" hallucinations ". The important point is that these sensory hallucina-
tions are constructs or creations for which some factor in the percipient
himself is responsible, though that factor is excluded from normal
consciousness. .
-a n
2. The following is another case of visual hallucination. Mr U.
Constable {Proc. xxi, 510) wrote :
" I have frequently to walk from my
house to the village club. The road outside the house runs for perhaps
twenty yards, with trees on one side and iron fencing on the other. Then
comes a five-barred gate, which I have to open to pass through into an
open field. The road is naturally very familiar to me. At nightfall, when
on leaving the light of the house, I can at first see nothing and, later on
only the path very dimly, and objects definite but at a yard or two, the
following false visualisation is of almost common occurrence. I see the
bars of the gate before me crossing my path before I come to the material
gate This false visualisation has occurred, very possibly twenty or thirty
times during the last three years, and carefully dissecting my experience,
I am of opinion that the false visualisation is, to me, as real and definite as
visualisation resulting from the material. I should perhaps state that this
false visualisation is unique in my experience." Later Mr Constable added:
"
Last night walking to the club, I determined to '
bilk '
the hallucination.
As I walked I marked a tree on my right and said to myself :
'
Now the
gate is within three feet of me.' I looked. There was the gate. I walked
to it. It was not there, but some six or seven feet distant. I looked again
at the tree (remember it was but a dim shadow in the darkness) and I saw
I had mistaken it for another."
The hallucinatory gate was as real and definite to Mr Constable as the
hallucinatory wall was to Mr A. But the Constable case reveals another
feature. Something resembling a motive appears. There was an expecta-
tion, amounting to a subconscious idee fixe, that the gate was in a different
position from that which it really occupied ; so the constructor of the
hallucination responded to this suggestion by causing the gate to appear in
accordance with the expectation.
The motive in Case i is not very obvious. We are told that the beautiful
and highly coloured designs which Mr A. saw were a source of great
pleasure to him, so that the motive may have been a subconscious desire
to compensate the percipient for his bad sight.
3. A very similar case was recorded by Miss Ina Jephson [Journal,
xxvii, 184). While staying with friends. Miss Jephson received a letter
from her lawyer saying that a cheque for £10 was enclosed. Having no
time to deal with it at the moment, she says : "I carried it about, peering
into the envelope occasionally to see whether the cheque was safely there.
It was finally packed with special care and I had pleasing memories
throughout the day of seeing the marbled pale colours of the cheque
and the look of the writing on it." When she arrived home, Miss Jephson
7° The Modus Operandi of [Part
looked into the envelope but found no cheque. She searched for it every-
where in vain, and at last wrote to her lawyer saying that she must have
lost it and asking him to stop payment. By return of post he answered
with an apology, saying that he had omitted to enclose the cheque but
would forward it at once. Miss Jephson says that she could hardly bring
herself to believe that all this had been a hallucination. She adds :
" If
cross-examined in a court of law I would have said with complete and-
absolute conviction that I had seen and handled the cheque in the first
letter." The apparitional cheque was as good an imitation of reality as in
'
the previous cases ; and this time the sense of touch seems to have been
hallucinated as well as that of sight. The motive is again strong expecta- |
tion generated by the statement made in the letter that the cheque was
enclosed. !
4. The following case, though of the same type, shows an interesting
dilTerence {Proc. xi, 423). The percipient of this hallucination went into
his office one night after dark, and, wishing to pass from the front room
to the back along a narrow passage, which was usually kept free from
obstructions, he started to walk rapidly along it.
" I had proceeded six or
eight feet in this rapid manner," he says, " when suddenly I saw a bright
yellow light lighting up very plainly the back of the chair which was in the
passage. The light was confined to the chair, and at the same time I |
stopped short. The stopping was quite involuntary on my part. The
light lasted for but a second, but it had shown me the chair distinctly,
especially the carving on the back of the chair." He searched in vain for
some explanation of the light, which had shone only in one place so as to
illuminate the chair. In this case the constructor of hallucinations,
instead of creating a hallucinatory object which was not there, created a
hallucinatory light to illuminate a real object, which shows adaptation to
circumstances. The motive was to give warning of danger.
5. So far the hallucinations have been visual. But the following case
illustrates a different kind of appeal to consciousness. A man had landed
from a steamer {Proc. xi, 422) and was attempting to make his way along
the dock-side to his hotel. It was night, and the darkness was increased
by the shadow of a warehouse which fell across his path. After following
for a short distance the edge of the quay, the narrator says :
" I suddenly
felt so strong an impulse to turn and go the other way that I instantly
obeyed. I saw nothing, heard nothing ; I did not even have an impression
of danger, though I did have a feeling that it must be in some way better
to turn. I distinctly remember that my reason protested, and berated me
for a fool for taking a roundabout way to my destination when the straight
way lay before me, with the added prospect of losing myself in the railway
yards with perhaps a ten-foot fence to climb. I laughed aloud and articu-
lated or at least mentally formed the words, '
You fool! What are you
doing this for.? '
However, my impulse proved stronger than my reason.
I persisted in '
going round Robin Hood's barn ', reached my hotel, and
there the matter passed from my mind." Next day he came back to the i
place and found that just beyond the point at which he had turned back \
the dock was cut away to form a steep slope, and, if he had gone on he
would have fallen onto this and have slid into the river and most probably
been drowned.
1-73] Paranormal Cognition 7^
Here the motive is again a warning. One must suppose that the sense
of sight had perceived the danger by such hght as there was, but so faintly
that the signal never reached consciousness. Hence the subliminal self
created this impulse to return as a means of stopping the percipient
quickly. The impulse to take a certain course of action was a message-
bearer to consciousness just as were the visual hallucinations in the other
cases.
6. Another case was that of a dentist {Proc. xi, 424), who was bending
over an apparatus for vulcanising rubber, when he heard a voice calling
to him in quick and imperative tones, " Run to the window, quick!
"
This was twice repeated and the dentist ran to the window and looked out
into the street. At that moment the vulcanising apparatus exploded so
violently that it broke the bench on which it stood and went through the
ceiling. No one else was in the room at the time. Again the motive was
to warn the conscious mind. We may suppose that the danger was sub-
consciously observed by the dentist ; but the method of mediating the
subconscious knowledge to consciousness was this time by means of
an auditory hallucination, probably the best way of eliciting a quick
response.
7. A more complex way of conveying subliminal knowledge to con-
sciousness is reported in Journal xxx, 1 80. Mrs Max West had lost a ruby
out of her ring while she was washing some clothes in a sink. Thinking
the ruby had gone down the drain, she gave it up for lost. " The following
morning I was in the same room ", says Mrs West, " when I seemed to
hear somebody say, '
What about that ruby? '
and without thinking that I
was alone audibly replied, '
Oh, that's gone for good, it is of no use
troubling about that.' By that time I realised that I was replying to no
visible person, but before I could think further, I seemed to be grasped
by the shoulders and twisted round and the first thing my eyes rested upon
was the ruby on the floor, shining in a shaft of sunlight made by the outside
door being open a crack. I do not wish it to be thought that I felt my
shoulders grasped any more than I heard any particular person's voice,
but that I was aware of myself as a person inside my body but the same
shape which heard and felt quite well without my body."
Here the motive, which was the desire to find the ruby, is obvious ;
but the method of informing consciousness was this time a good deal more
complex. It was both auditory and tactile and was, in fact, a little drama.
This time the hallucinations do not seem to have been quite like normal
perceptions.
8. The Rev. P. H. Newnham, who was an entomologist, reported the
following experience (Proc. xi, 41 1). "I have on many occasions through-
out the last thirty-five years at least experienced the sensation of a soundless
voice speaking words distinctly into my ear from outside of me. Whenever
this has been the case, the information or advice given has invariably
proved correct. ... In July 1858 (I believe, but it may have been June
1857), I was visiting friends at Tunbridge Wells and went out one evening
entomologising. As I crossed the stile into a field, on my way to a neigh-
bouring wood, the voice distinctly said in my right ear, '
You will find
Chaonia on that oak.' (This was a very scarce moth which I had never
seen before and which most assuredly I had never consciously thought of
72 The Modus Operandi of [Part
seeing.) There were several oaks in the field, but I intuitively walked up
to one, straight to the off side of it, and there was the moth indicated."
The motive here was Mr Newnham's interest in rare moths. The mode
of informing consciousness was again an auditory hallucination, which was
this time fully externalised in distinction to the partially externalised
hallucination of Case 7. We may suppose that Mr Newnham subcon-
sciously saw the moth flying towards one particular tree ; but the sup-
position is rather far fetched, since the moth was found on the off side of it.
These eight cases are examples of mediation to consciousness of sub-
conscious knowledge by means, chiefly, of sensory hallucinations. They
do not involve the paranormal. The sensory and impulsive experiences
were not in themselves paranormal ; and the information conveyed may
be explained as originating in a normal source. But in cases 6 to 8 the
information might have been acquired paranormally. There is of course a
very wide field of sensory hallucination which is not regarded as paranormal-
hypnotic, eidetic, pathological and occurring incidentally in ordinary life.
It is unnecessary to deal with this here. The cases quoted are sufficient to
show (i) that sensory hallucinations are unconsciously constructed by the
percipient, (2) that the senses of sight, hearing and touch can be hallucinated
with great perfection, and also with varying degrees of perfection. (Prob-
ably taste and smell can also be hallucinated if occasion arises.) (3) that
an impulse to action may take the place of a sensory hallucination, (4) that
all these are messages from the subliminal self to consciousness, (5) that
all are created in response to something which may be broadly called a
subconscious " motive ". In all this we are concerned with psychological
processes which may be called " normal ", since they are produced by
standing mechanisms forming an integral part of every normal human
being.
In the above cases it was not only the mechanism of mediation that was
normal : the subject-matter of the hallucinations and the motives which
gave rise to the phenomena were normal also. But the whole of the
phenomena originated in the subconscious region of the percipient's
personality. So far we have not left the field of normal psychological
happenings.
The Mediating Vehicle
The function of these hallucinations and impulses was to mediate
something to consciousness—some urge or desire or motive existing in
the subliminal portion of the self. I shall in future call them " Mediating
Vehicles ". One important thing to notice is that the full-blown hallucina-
tions we have been considering (more properly called " apparitions ")
are only the end term of a series. Visual hallucinations may be fully
externalised in space and may appear to be exactly like normal, visual
percepts. But they may also appear like a picture framed in a hole in the
wall, or may take the form of a vision seen in a crystal or of a vivid semi-
internal image, or of a dream. There are all gradations, and the fully
externalised hallucination differs from the others only in degree and not in
kind. With auditory hallucinations it is the same. The voice may be
fully externalised, as in Cases 6 and 8, or partially externalised as in
Case 7. A tactual hallucination may be fully externalised, as in Miss
. \

Jephson's apparent handling of her cheque in Case 3, or partly exter-
nalised, as in Case 7. All are constructs, and all are mediating vehicles,
whose function it is to bear some kind of message to consciousness.
Paranormal Cases. In examples 4 to 8 the view was taken that the
knowledge mediated was obtained from faint, unnoticed registrations made
by the normal senses. This explanation wore rather thin in Cases 7 and 8.
9. The following case takes us over the border. I will call the per-
cipient in this case Mrs " Field ". Members of the Society will find
her real name in Journal xxxi, 53. She says :
" Early in January I was
staying with my sister. The day before I left I had a letter from my
daughter R. in which I read, '
Nanny is in bed with bronchitis.' I read
it out to my sister. I wrote to my daughter V. to tell her. When I got
home next day my first question was, '
How is Nanny? '
R. : She's all
right, I suppose. I : You said she was in bed with bronchitis. R. : No,
I never said such a thing. Next morning I went to see how things were
and found N. just out of bed and very sadly indeed, having had bronchitis.
I : Miss R. told me you had had bronchitis. Miss R. ! But she didn't .
know! I wouldn't tell her to trouble her. Getting home I looked again
at the letter. I knew exactly the place on the page where I had seen,
'
Nanny is in bed with bronchitis '
; it wasn't there or any\vhere else in the
letter, nor was there room in it for a single extra line. Nanny had been
greatly longing to see me to pour all out but wouldn't write, as I was on a
holiday."
The motive in this case was of course Nanny's intense desire to see
Mrs Field and pour out her troubles to her, a motive which may have been
intensified by having been repressed. Mrs Field's daughter says that
Nanny was " rampant " to see her mother. The mediating vehicle was a
visual hallucination of exactly the same kind as in Cases 2 and 3. The
only difference is that in this case the motive was in someone else's mind
and not in that of the percipient. That makes the case paranormal. But
there is no difference in the psychological mechanism which mediates the
idea to consciousness. That is no more paranormal in this case than it
was in the other^s. Indeed, if one compares Cases 3 and 9, the impression
is strong that the paranormal element in 9 is only incidental. If it is
desirable that something be notified by the subliminal to the supraliminal,
the former just ignores the fact that sometimes the information may be in
what we call " another " mind.
10. A very similar case was reported in Journal xxvii, 326. Permis-
sion to quote this has not been given, but members will find the case
at this reference. The brief facts were that a person died in the night
and her friend, living in another place, awoke in the morning to see a
piece of paper lying on her pillow with a message on it saying that so-and-so
died last night. From the name given there could be no doubt about the
person meant. The paper and message were hallucinatory and vanished.
11. All these cases illustrate the function of the mediating vehicle. .
The next case, however, tells us something else about it. A certain
Mrs B. {Journal x, 162) had a son H., who was in the army and in West
Africa. One night she dreamt that she saw a young sergeant look in at
the door of a room she seemed to be in, and she asked him, " Where is
H.? " He replied, " Don't be alarmed ;
they are carrying him along all
74 The Modus Operandi of - [Part
right. He has broken his leg. You cannot see him yet but you will bye
and bye." The fact was that H. at the time was ill and was being carried
in a palanquin. He became worse and died early the following month.
But he had not broken his leg. That accident had happened to him years
before when he was five. So the dream, which was in this case the
mediating vehicle, was called upon to do double duty, first to mediate to
the percipient's consciousness the paranormally acquired knowledge of her
son's critical illness, and secondly to mediate a remembered fact which
was emotionally linked with it. Notice that the two facts, derived from
different sources, are not kept apart in the mediating vehicle. The young
sergeant is made to weave the two facts into one and the same message.
Thus, different motives can make use of one mediating vehicle. This
shows that we should be careful how we speak of a " telepathic dream ".
It would be more correct to speak of a dream which contains a telepathic
element. Similarly telepathic experiments should be planned, not merely
to yield a significant number of successes, but to afford a means of studying
how the successes are obtained. They should be planned to help us to
study the formation of the mediating vehicle. Once its presence and
function are grasped, we are saved from the mistake of regarding para-
normal cognition as a kind of " sixth sense " working in a way analogous
to sense-perception.
There is no need to quote other examples of a mediating vehicle which
has been pressed into service for more than one purpose. The principle
can be seen in a large number of cases. We have merely to remember that
the mediating vehicle, like a taxi, can be shared by two or more passengers.
The above cases are all spontaneous. I will now quote an instance of
experimental paranormal cognition.
12. A series of experiments in telepathy was tried by Dr S., a physician
of San Francisco, and his wife, when the two were nearly a hundred
miles apart {Proc. xi, 455). The case was investigated by Richard Hodgson.
At a fixed time each day Dr and Mrs S. arranged to sit for thirty minutes
for telepathic results, each acting alternately as agent and percipient. The
experiment taken as a whole shows that chance cannot reasonably account
for the coincidences obtained (unless more potency is attributed to chance
in a telepathic experiment than would be attributed to it in other connec-
tions). Sorne of the results suggest precognition. A single day's record
will be sufficient for the present purpose :
" May 1 2th.— May 12th.—Received.
Transmitter, Mrs S.

jacket of same. Little boy three years old.
[Boy expected, but did not arrive until

173] Paranormal Cognition 75
The mediating vehicle apparently took the form of visual hallucinations
very slightly externalised, for Dr S. says in' the course of his account that
everything he received came to him in the form of mental pictures. The
motive, as in all experimental cases, was of course the desire to obtain a
telepathic result.
One thing shows clearly here, which it is of importance for anyone who
experiments in paranormal cognition to notice, and that is the large amount
of veridical material which the percipient produced over and above that
which the agent endeavoured to send. Some of these items were pre-
cognitive. This shows that telepathy does not consist in the transmission
of the conscious thoughts of the agent to the percipient. Any suggestion to
this effect that experiments in card-guessing and the like may present
should be regarded very critically. There is not sufficient content in the
card-guessing event to reveal this feature, which is further demonstrated
in Case 13.
The process of mediation of paranormal cognition to consciousness by
means of a mediating vehicle is precisely the same in experimental as in
spontaneous cases. The event, if it is to be informative and not mis-
leading, must possess a certain amount of qualitative content. The
experiments in telepathy carried out by Miss Miles and Miss Ramsden
(Proc. xxi, 61) are well worthy of study from the point of view of medi-
ation. They show the often symbolical nature of the mediating vehicle
and the part played by association of ideas in the formation of one
vehicle after another. I shall not occupy space by quoting these experi-
ments here in detail, but would point out the necessity for carrying
out experiments of this kind if we are to learn more about paranormal
cognition.
Many more cases, both spontaneous and experimental, could be quoted
to illustrate the fundamental fact that paranormal cognition is mediated to
consciousness by means of psychological constructs. I began by quoting
eight cases in which these constructs were shown mediating subconscious
knowledge which was not paranormal because it had been acquired (or so
we assumed) by normal means. I then passed to a case (No. 9) in which a
precisely similar construct mediated subconscious knowledge which was
paranormal because it had been acquired from the mind of another person.
There was no difference whatever in the mechanism of mediation.
Exactly the same type of visual hallucination was employed, in the one
case as in the others. I then quoted a case in which the mediating vehicle,
this time a dream, conveyed a piece of paranormal knowledge and an old
memory at the same time. The same piece of mechanism embodied both.
A study of these cases shows that there is a motive, or something com-
parable with a motive, behind the creation of these vehicles or messengers
to consciousness. In Case i this may have been an impulse to artistic
expression and a subconscious wish to give to the percipient a pleasure
which he normally lacked ; in Cases 2 and 3 a fixed expectation found
self-expression : in Cases 4, 5 and 6 the motive was a desire to warn
against danger : in Cases 7 and 8 the motive was to satisfy the percipient's
normal interest : in Case 9 the motive was a suppressed desire to confide
a trouble to another. They are psychologically the same type of thing.
The fact that in Case 9 the motive originated in someone else's mind and not
76 The Modus Operandi of [Part
in that of the percipient seems to be incidental. It certainly carries us
across the partition which we place between the " normal " and the
" paranormal " ; but it suggests at the same time that this partition may be
artificial. When in Case 1 1 we find the same vehicle used to mediate both
what we call the normal and the paranormal, this suggestion is intensified.
In any case, whether we choose to call the matter which is mediated normal
or paranormal, it is clear that the mediating vehicle itself is in all cases
normal. It is produced by psychological mechanism which is an integral
factor in us all.
Approached from the point of view which I have selected, paranormal
cognition is clearly seen to consist of two quite distinct factors, (i) para-
normal cognition in its essence, which is a function of the subliminal self,
of whose nature and processes consciousness knows nothing, and (2) the
mediating vehicle, which is a psychological construct contrived by some
factor of the personality, which lies outside consciousness, in order to
convey to consciousness at second hand some knowledge of the genuine
paranormal cognition.
This is the fundamental fact to bear in mind when formulating
hypotheses about this faculty.
It is customary to speak as if we know that there are difierent kinds of
paranormal cognition, [a) telepathy, [b) clairvoyance, (c) precognition and
{d) retrocognition. But if the above facts are grasped, we shall realise that
we do not know anything about the nature of paranormal cognition itself.
Starting with the assumption that there are these different subdivisions
of the faculty, we may, by varying the conditions, appear to find support
for the view that one or other of them is operating separately. How
careful we have to be in drawing such conclusions will appear presently.
13. A Simple Case of Paranormal Cognition.
The following case of paranormal cognition, which would on the face
of it, be usually classed as a case of spontaneous telepathy, has been chosen
on account of its simplicity. It will be useful to examine it carefully.
It is, indeed, little use accumulating such cases unless we extract from
them what light we can on the processes involved. Can it be explained
by telepathy? If so, by what sort of telepathy? Or can it be explained by
clairvoyance, that is to say by a faculty of paranormal perception which
reveals physical objects and events in a way which is comparable with that
of normal sense-perception ?
A certain lady, a Mrs Conner {Proc. vii, 35) when going up the steps of
her house in Washington, D.C., stumbled and fell, her hat going one way
and the papers she was carrying another. At or about the same time, a
friend of hers, a Mrs B., while sitting sewing in a room of her house a mile
and a half away, had a waking vision of the accident. The separation in
time between the accident and the vision cannot have been more than an
hour and was probably less than half an hour.
Mrs B.'s account, written on the evening of the day of the occurrence
(which took place between 2 and 3 p.m.) and before she had heard of it, is
as follows. " I was sitting in my room sewing this afternoon about two
o'clock when what should I see but your own dear self ; but Heavens!
in what a position. Now, I don't want to excite your curiosity too much,
173] Paranormal Cognition 77
or try your patience too long, so will come to the point at once. You were
falling up the front steps in the yard. You had on your black skirt and
velvet waist, your little straw bonnet and in your hand were some papers.
When you fell your hat went in one direction and your papers in another.
You got up very quickly, put on your bonnet, picked up the papers and lost
no time in getting into the house. You did not appear to be hurt but looked
somewhat mortified. It was all so plain to me that I had ten notions to one
to dress myself and come over and see if it were true, but finally concluded
that a sober, industrious woman like yourself would not be stumbling
around at that rate and thought I'd best not go on a wild goose chase.
Now, what do you think of such a vision as that.' Is there any possible
truth in it? I feel almost ready to scream with laughter whenever I think
of it ;
you did look too funny spreading yourself out in the front yard.
'
Great was the fall thereof.' I can distinctly call to mind the house in
which you live, but for the life of me I cannot tell whether there are any
steps from the side walk into the yard, as I saw them or not. Now do tell
me, dear, if I saw correctly or not, or if the thing was shown me simply to
give me something to laugh about.'
"
In reply to questions, Mrs Conner affirmed that the description of her
clothing was quite correct ; that when she fell on the steps the time was
almost exactly nineteen minutes to three. Mrs B. did not notice the exact
time, but states that her experience occurred " about two o'clock ". The
two events were probably not separated in time by more than forty
minutes and may have been more nearly coincident. An experience so
vivid that the percipient sat down at once to write an account of it, co-
inciding with the event in such detail and so nearly in time, cannot reason-
ably be attributed to chance. Also the vision was not a dream but a rare
waking experience. Mrs B. was not familiar with the house as Mrs
Conner had only moved into it a few days before.
This is a simple case of apparent telepathy ; but we have also to consider
whether it might not be a case of clairvoyance. Regarding it as a case of
telepathy, we are confronted at once with a difficulty. Mrs B., in this
vision which was " all so plain " to her, saw Mrs Conner as the latter
would have appeared to an outside observer standing nearby at one par-
ticular point in space. But no one is consciously aware with any degree of
accuracy of his detailed appearance as an outside observer would see it.
People who, by means of an arrangement of mirrors, see themselves from
unwonted angles, are often much surprised at their own appearance.
It is not in the least likely—in fact it is impossible—that Mrs Conner, even
had she been a superlative artist, could, without the aid of mirrors, have
painted a portrait of herself exactly in every detail as Mrs B. saw her in
the vision. No one knows consciously all the details needed to make such
a picture. Can we suppose that these details are known subconsciously
and can be telepathically transmitted to a percipient.' I think if we
assume subconscious knowledge of the full details of anyone's personal
appearance as seen from one particular point in space, we must assume that
this knowledge also extends to every other view-point. This would imply
subconscious knowledge of an infinite amount of detail, all so precise and
clear that when objectified in sensory hallucinations the result is in-
distinguishable from normal percepts. This is surely a large order. In
78 The Modus Operandi of [Part
addition, there is the evidence of the cases already cited that it is the per-
cipient who constructs these hallucinations ; and we know that they may
be partly symbolical in character and need not by any means faithfully
portray the real details. In the light of this it seems more likely that the
subliminal self of the agent is not aware of an unlimited quantity of detail,
but is aware of his bodily appearance in some more general fashion, and
that the percipient is able to abstract from this general knowledge the
specific and limited aspect he requires.
It may help us here to remember that we think of the world about us in
one way and perceive it in another. We think of it in terms of propositions :
we perceive it in terms of sensory images. Suppose that -Y, a friend of
ours, is about to leave London, we think : X is now in Paddington
station. That is a proposition which we cannot convert, as such, into
sensory terms. We cannot see X in Paddington station with the degree of
generality that the propositional statement implies. We can see him only
in much more restricted ways, at the booking-office, or at some particular
spot on the platform, or getting into the train. And we can see him in any
one of these positions from an indefinite number of points of view. But
we cannot, by the use of our senses, perceive the propositional situation
that we think of. That propositional situation comprises an infinite set
of disjunctive sense-situations. It is by means of sense-perception alone
that we become aware of the surrounding physical world ; that is to
say, knowledge of the world we live in, as we gain it, is of a much more
limited, piecemeal and unintegrated kind than is thought.
Now, the direction in which it seems to me that the evidence for para-
normal cognition points is that the subliminal self is capable of something
which is more like an immediate awareness of propositions than it is like
sense-perception. I do not wish this statement to be taken too literally.
It is only a groping attempt to get a little nearer to the truth. Quite
possibly the nature of paranormal cognition is beyond our understanding.
The proposition, " X is in Paddington station now," covers {a) an
infinite number of physical situations, any one of which X might be
occupying now in the station, and {b) each one of which could give rise to
an infinite number of groups of sense-data, since in each position he
occupies. A' may be sensed in an infinite number of ways. Also, {c) X in
any one of these physical situations could be represented by any one of an
infinite number of sets of mental images or hallucinatory pictures.
I suggest that Mrs Conner's subliminal self was aware of her bodily
appearance and situation in a way analogous to an awareness of a proposi-
tion, and that in this way the awareness was shared by the subliminal self
of Mrs B. This subliminal sharing constitutes telepathy. But this
propositional awareness must be of such a nature as to be able to supply
the materials out of which any one of an infinite number of hallucinatory
representations of itself can be constructed. Mrs B. subconsciously
constructed one of these and presented it to her own consciousness.
That I am being vague about the nature of this propositional awareness,
and also about the way in which it contains, potentially, an infinite number '
of specific, hallucinatory self-representations of itself, I freely admit. All .,
I say is that the evidence seems to me to point in this direction. The
propositional awareness need not be mediated to consciousness by means
Paranormal Cognition 79
of a sensory hallucination. As we saw in Case 5, it may be by an impulse :
it may also be by means of words. In automatic speech and writing the
mediating vehicle assumes a verbal form.
It might, perhaps, be urged against the view I have suggested that in a
verbal form the mediating vehicle would be itself propositional. But are
there not propositions of varying degrees of generality, and may not the
generality of a verbal mediating vehicle be of a lesser degree than the
generality of the subliminal knowledge which it mediates?
We thus see that if telepathy is the explanation of this simple spon-
taneous case, it is a telepathy which is very dilferent from thought-
transference as usually understood. It was not Mrs Conner's conscious
thoughts which were transmitted to Mrs B. but a general, subconscious
awareness which we are far from understanding. That Mrs Conner was
consciously aware of her situation was an attendant feature of the case,
which may have been quite irrelevant. Certainly a conscious intention
to produce telepathy is not essential to its production ;
for Mrs Conner
did not intend to make herself visible to Mrs B., and in the numerous
spontaneous cases of telepathy, the intention to produce it is as a rule
absent. We must not, therefore, approach experimental telepathy with
the idea that the conscious thought of the agent impresses itself on the
percipient. The most that we can legitimately assume is that the desire
on the part of both agent and percipient to produce a result has some
directional effect on the process. I shall in future call the kind of tele-
pathy, or thought-transference, in which the agent's conscious thoughts
are supposed to be transmitted to the percipient " naive telepathy ".
Can we explain Case 13 by means of clairvoyance? This would mean
that Mrs B. paranormally perceived Mrs Conner's prostrate body as it lay
on the steps. This suggestion meets with a difficulty at once. The case
is a spontaneous one and therefore Mrs B. knew nothing about it before-
hand, or at the time, until she experienced the vision. Supposing, there-
fore, that she possessed a clairvoyant faculty which was capable of revealing
to her physical objects, what was there to direct the faculty to this par-
ticular object? Had she received a telepathic message from Mrs Conner,
that would have enabled her to direct her supposed clairvoyant faculty to
Mrs Conner's body? But if we assume telepathy there is no need to
assume clairvoyance. Having defined the clairvoyant faculty as a form of
sense-perception, we cannot endow it with a power of self-direction which
enables it to seek out particular situations which have the appearance of
being telepathic. A clairvoyant faculty, as defined, might just as well
have lit upon any other physical object as upon Mrs Conner's body at the
precise moment when it lay on the steps of her house.
It may be, however, that we ought to allow that if there is such a thing
as a clairvoyant faculty, it might have a particular habit of browsing among
the physical things which particularly interested Mrs B. I am not quite
sure to what extent we could assume that the faculty could do this without
being consciously directed by its owner. We do have to direct our vision
consciously to this or that object. Perhaps it might not be quite the same
with clairvoyance. But let us suppose that the clairvoyant faculty is
confined to those physical objects and events which particularly interested
Mrs B. It will then be equally likely to fall at any moment on any one of
8o The Modus Operandi of [Part
Mrs B.'s friends, on any one of her books, papers, household possessions
or the distant things and places which interest her. It was a remarkable
coincidence if it fell on Mrs Conner at the precise moment when it looked
as if she might be in a position to send a telepathic message to her friend.
And again, if it is equally likely to fall on any of the objects which interest
Mrs B., it must surely have fallen on many such objects again and again.
Where are the sudden visions of her relations in all sorts of positions, of her
books, of her silver spoons, of her bank-book, of her furniture and of a
hundred other things? How is it, if it is due to clairvoyance, that this
vision of Mrs Conner is almost unique in her experience.'' This case of
Mrs Conner's does not differ from dozens of other examples of apparent
spontaneous telepathy. Such cases evidently cannot be explained by
clairvoyance, because clairvoyance, if it is to explain them, would need
telepathy to direct it.
While we are considering this case, it will be as well to examine another
hypothesis, that of a non-physical body which can travel through space.
The idea that there is such a body has given rise to the term " travelling
clairvoyance ". In spiritualist circles it is usually referred to as the
" etheric " body. Whether there is in fact a non-physical body of some
kind is really a separate question from whether such a body could explain
the facts of apparent telepathy or apparent clairvoyance. With regard to
the latter problem, can we suppose that there is a non-physical body which
travels through physical space and perceives (or causes its owner to per-
ceive) a physical object or scene at a distant place.' Mrs B.'s non-physical
body must have disengaged itself from her material body and travelled a
mile and a half through physical space to look at Mrs Conner's material
body. Anything which can travel through space must have a position in
space, since to travel is to change spatial position. But how can a non-
material body occupy a definite position in space.' How would you
measure the number of inches to a non-material body from the four walls
of a room? If the body is non-material, there is nothing to define the
position of its outline. With what speed does the body travel? This is a
legitimate question, since it is said to travel through space. What propels
it? By what means does it steer a definite course to its destination? Why,
if non-material bodies are sometimes observable, are they never observed
en route} And when the non-physical body arrives, what happens? How
is the object seen? Do physical light-rays enter the non-physical eyes of
the body and produce non-physical effects on its non-physical organs and
brain ? Surely physical light-rays must produce physical effects on physical
objects. And even if the non-physical brain is affected, why should that
produce the same sensations in the mind of its owner as are produced by
effects in the physical brain? It seems that we must postulate a non-
physical space for the non-physical body to travel in and non-physical
light-rays to affect it, while these non-physical light-rays must be reflected
from non-physical duplicates of the physical objects perceived—in fact
the physical body and the physical world must be provided with non-
physical duplicates. Everything physical must have a non-physical
parallel down to the last detail. It is true that we must not reject a
hypothesis because it is strange ; but can we really duplicate the entire
physical world and then put " non " before it? Besides, there is another
173] Paranormal Cognition . 81
fact which points against this space-traveUing view. The distant scene is
not by any means always seen accurately. There was a case in which a
clairvoyant was asked to give the position of the body of a person who had
been drowned in a lake. She said that if one stood at given position
on the bank, the body would be found so many yards to the left.
Actually the distance given was correct, but the body was to the right.
This sort of thing points much more to the creation of a scene which
represents the events than to any direct vision of them. Of course a
subject who has the experience of seeing a distant scene has the feeling of
being physically present there, just as a spectator of a film depicting scenes
in a distant country has to a certain extent the feeling of being there and
would have that feeling much more strongly if the film were able to present
the scene in three dimensions as extending all round him. But this feeling
is not necessarily veridical.
The most plausible hypothesis to account for Case 13 is the telepathic
hypothesis ;
yet it is a telepathy which is not like thought-transference.
The clairvoyant hypothesis we have found untenable ; and also the
hypothesis of a non-physical body which travels through physical space.
A More Complex Case of Paranormal Cognition.
14. A complex reciprocal case, which is often quoted {Proc. vii, 41 ), is that
of Mr and Mrs Wilmot. The essential facts are that Mr Wilmot was
voyaging home to America in a ship in which he shared a peculiarly
shaped cabin with a companion, a Mr Tait. One night he " dreamt " (at
any rate he calls it a dream) that he saw his wife, who was then in bed in
her home in the United States, come to the cabin door, pause irresolutely
on the threshold as if embarrassed by the sight of a stranger in the cabin,
then advance to his bedside and caress him. This scene was also witnessed
by Mr Tait, who was awake, and was occupying the berth above Mr
Wilmot. So real was Mr Tait's vision that he challenged his companion
in the morning with having received a visit from a real woman. On
arriving home, Mr Wilmot discovered that on that very night his wife had
had the experience of seeming to travel across the ocean to a ship, of
entering a cabin, whose peculiar shape she described, and of visiting her
husband in the manner he had experienced. She was also aware of the
presence of Mr Tait in the upper berth.
Can this case be explained by clairvoyance? Mrs Sidgwick when
dealing with the case remarks : "I should still hold with Mr Gurney
that this [the fact that Mrs Wilmot had tried to establish voluntarily
communication with her husband at the time of the experience] is no
reason for regarding the incident as other than telepathic, for there is as
little ground for supposing that Mrs Wilmot could have perceived psychi-
cally any cabin as there is for thinking that Mrs Paquet [a case previously
quoted] could have had a vision of any death-scene. In other words, it is
probable that the presence of the husband and brother respectively were
essential conditions of the percipience, which, therefore, depended on
some unknown process of communication from mind to mind. The
fact that Mr Wilmot at the same time dreamt of his wife seems to me,
if anything to strengthen the telepathic hypothesis because it shows that
there was actually a community of mental impressions." This is precisely
82 The Modus Operandi of [Part
the point we have been discussing. Without guidance, the clairvoyant
faculty would never have hit upon the appropriate target at the appropriate
moment ; and how could this guidance have been given without telepathy?
The clairvoyant explanation of this case involves the preposterous view
that three clairvoyant faculties, belonging to Mr Wilmot, Mrs Wilmot
and Mr Tait, respectively, all converged upon the same scene at the same
moment without anything to direct them. Clairvoyance as an explanation
is surely here out of the question.
It is true that this case, when superficially regarded, does suggest a
travelling, non-physical body. We have seen the difficulties this view
involves ; but it is worth while bearing it in mind while we look at some
further examples of paranormal cognition.
15. Mr J. Kirk carried out some experiments in which he tried to make
himself visible to a distant percipient {Journal \, 21-30). He was successful
in doing this : the percipient saw his apparition. As Mr Kirk sat in his
room acting as agent in these experiments, his attention was attracted by a
strong disc of light coming from the under part of the lamp-shade. This
was so conspicuous that he thought he would try fixing his attention on it.
He did this, and the percipient then saw a luminous cloud which con-
centrated into a bright disc. Here we see that, without any change of
method, a case of apparitional appearance changes into an ordinary case of
experimental telepathy. Some would regard the appearance of Mr Kirk's
apparition in a distant room as proof of his non-physical body having
travelled there. Would they say that when he concentrated his attention
on the disc of light from the lamp that its non-physical body travelled
there as well.' Would they say that in every telepathic experiment the non-
physical body of the object thought about travels to the percipient.'
If not, is it not clear that in all cases, whether the percipient perceives
an inanimate object or a human being, what he perceives is his own
unconscious construct} It may be fully externalised and appear to
occupy a place in the room ; or it may be only partially externalised ; or
it may be merely a mental image. In all cases it is a construct and acts^
as a mediating vehicle to consciousness.
In the Wilmot case I suggest that it is the same. All the visual hallucina-
tions, whether of the cabin or its occupants or of Mrs Wilmot herself, were
constructs. There was no real travelling through space, and no clairvoyant
perception of physical objects. If we must classify these cases, they were
telepathic in the sense that there was no paranormal perception of physical
objects or e\ ents. But, although in a sense telepathic, they were not cases
of simple thought-transference.
A Further Difficulty for Clairvoyance.
16. Another difficulty which confronts us when we try to explain cases of
ostensible telepathy by clairvoyance is the fact that the event sometimes
takes place a good deal earlier than the percipient's experience. Mrs
Paquet's case afl^ords an example of this (Proc. vii, 32). She had a vision
of the death of her brother, complete with veridical details, about six
hours after it occurred. If clairvoyance is a kind of paranormal sense-
perception, it must surely reveal what is happening in the present and not
what has happened in the past. To account for its presenting the past,
173] Paranormal Cognition 83
we should have to suppose that the act of perception was subconsciously
performed at the time of the event, and that it was iitted with a delay-
action which only allowed it to reach consciousness at some later period.
But this would in reality take away from clairvoyance the character of
being a perceptual sense, which is given to it by definition. It could no
longer be held that the percipient, by means of clairvoyance, perceives a
distant physical event. It would have to be admitted that what he con-
sciously perceives is a hallucinatory scene constructed for him here and
now. In other words clairvoyance becomes, not a faculty of perception,
but a mechanism for mediating and relaying to consciousness knowledge
which has been acquired we know not how. As such, it is no longer
" clairvoyance " as that faculty is defined. I shall in future refer to
clairvoyance, defined as a faculty of paranormal perception of physical
objects and events, as " naive clairvoyance ".
The time-lag, which so often accompanies paranormal cognition, seems
equally difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis of a travelling, non-
physical body.
17. " Travelling Clairvoyance ".
Some of the most suggestive evidence in paranormal cognition occurs
under the heading of " travelling clairvoyance ". Most of this evidence
has been obtained with a particular kind of subject who passes easily into
light hypnosis. One of these sensitives, called " Jane ", was " mesmer-
ised " at intervals during a long period from 1845 onwards for the sake of
her health. Jane was by all accounts a simple and honest woman, the
wife of a Durham pitman, and her case was witnessed by the Rev. C.
Green and his two sisters, one of whom married a cousin of F. W. H.
Myers. The latter, who was interested in the case, says that Jane never
received any fee or made any exhibition of her faculty, which she concealed
as much as she could {Proc. vii, 53). When in the hypnotic state, Jane
would begin to talk in childish language and would ask to " travel ".
Dr F., who hypnotised her by looking at her steadfastly, was the principal
witness. Jane was a sensitive who naturally, and without any elaborate
process of being hj'pnotised, fell into a suggestible state. When in it, she
could be verbally directed to " go " to any desired place and to describe
what she saw there. The value of such a sensitive for research does not
seem to have been realised at the time, and the case was not as carefully
conducted as it should have been. Dr F. 's notes were not taken with
sufficient care. Still, Jane did just the same kind of thing as is recorded of
several other sensitives of the same type. When " hypnotised " (though
the state seems to have been more like spontaneous trance) and told to go
to a certain house and report what was going on there, Jane did so with a
considerable degree of success, though she also produced a certain amount
of failure. She was verbally directed from point to point in an imaginary
journey by the investigator, and questioned as to what she saw as she
progressed. The scenes she perceived were extremely real to her. We
read that " in the spirit she still feels in a body and expects people to see
her and resents being jostled by a crowd, was nearly run over by horses
and a carriage. Once when told to go and see a friend, she called out,
'
What a rude man, he has nearly run over me with his prancing horses.
'
"
1
84 The Modus Operandi of [Part
We are told that she did not know the man with the prancing horses, who
actually lived in the south of England while Jane lived in the north ; but
ishe described his profession of homoeopathic medicine, and when she
reached his front door, read the name " Williams " correctly on the door-
post.
In one house to which she was told to go, she described a cradle which
was rocking with no one near it. It turned out that the baby had a habit of
rocking itself. In another house she read the word " Salve " on the tiles
outside the door ; and in case after case she described details which she
did not normally know, and which could not reasonably be ascribed to
chance.
On one occasion Dr F. tried an experiment with a patient of his, Mr
Eglinton, which shows how experiments in paranormal cognition could be
planned with this kind of subject, which might throw real light on its
nature. He told this patient to be in a particular room in his own house
at a certain time. Jane was then verbally led to the house and, on her own
initiative, supplied correct details of the surroundings on the way, which
supplemented those she was told of. For example, she asked :
" Is it
the red house with a brass knocker? " Dr F. replied ;
" No, it has an iron
knocker." But, he adds, that he afterwards looked and found that the door
had an old-fashioned brass handle in the shape of a knocker.
Directed to Mr Eglinton's room, Jane described a very fat man with a
cork leg coming into the room and seating himself at the table with papers
before him and a glass of brandy and water. Asked if she could see his
name on any of the letters, she spelt out letter by letter the word " Eglin-
ton ". Dr F. thought the whole of this description wrong, because Mr
Eglinton was very thin and had no cork leg. Actually it was, in a curious
way, true ; for Mr Eglinton had made a dummy by stuffing his clothes
to produce the appearance of a very fat man and had seated the dummy at
the table with the papers and the brandy and water as described. Jane was
firm on the point that it was brandy in the glass and no other liquid. She
took the dummy for a living man with a cork leg. There was no cork leg ;
but the mode of representation supports the view that the whole scene was
a sensory construct, the cork leg being inserted as a kind of compromise
between the superficial inference that the man was alive and the deeper
knowledge that the figure was counterfeit. Jane's spelling of the name
" Eglinton " was correct, whereas Dr F. had thought till then that it was
spelt " Eglington ".
There is no suggestion in all this that Jane's non-physical body travelled
to Mr Eglinton's house and took up a post of observation in his room. The
information was all paranormally accessible in the knowledge of Dr F.
and Mr Eglinton, and the scene could easily have been a sensory construc-
tion. But there is still the question of whether the information was
acquired from these two minds or by naive clairvoyance. The false details
of the fat man coming into the room by the door, and the cork leg perhaps
tell a little against the clairvoyant view ; but the question needs much more
consideration. On either the telepathic or the clairvoyant view, it must,
I think, be agreed that what Jane saw was a constructed vision of the type
we call " hallucinatory " ; that is to say it was what I have called a
" mediating vehicle ".
173] Paranormal Cognition '
85
I do not wish to lay too much stress on the " Jane " case, since it is not
as strong evidentially as might be wished. But Dr Alfred Backman, of
Kalmar in Sweden {Proc. vii. 199-220 and 370-73) carried out experiments
with several subjects of a similar type to Jane, and there seems to be no
reasonable doubt that he was a careful and conscientious investigator.
He was visited in 1891 by F. W. H. Myers, Dr A. T. Myers, Prof. Richet
and M. Houdaille, who were allowed to witness and to conduct certain
experiments. F. Myers says :
" Perhaps the most important outcome of
our visit was the conviction that all of us gained as to the absolute candour
and disinterested desire for truth with which Dr Backman 's experiments
are conducted and the simplicity and good faith of the subjects whom he
employs."
Backman's sensitives were Anna Samuelsson, Alma Radberg, Miss
H. L., Ebba Lundberg, Hilda Ljunggren, Agda Olsen and " Cecilia ".
They mostly came to him as patients. It is noteworthy that he says :
" In
the first place I have found that unless I have been unusually fortunate in
meeting with clairvoyants, they are not so rare as is generally supposed.
On the contrary, a great number of persons capable of being hypnotised
have clairvoyant faculties." It is extraordinary that this hint should
never have been followed up by those who later made experiments in
paranormal cognition.
18. Alma Radberg, when " lightly hypnotised ", was given a folded
letter written in French, a language she did not know, and at once
described the writer and, in general terms, the contents of the letter.
" Alma was then awakened ; but (as usual with Dr Backman's subjects)
she remembered her trance-sensations, and was able to add further
details." We are told that the description of the writer of the letter was
" practically correct " and the gist of the letter was also true. Like " Jane ",
Backman's sensitives were directed verbally. The conditions for investi-
gating " extra-sensory perception ", or paranormal cognition, were almost
perfect. Not only could Alma describe what she saw while in her light
hypnotic trance, but she could amplify her descriptions after waking.
19. Another subject, Anna Samuelsson, was directed to " go to
Kalmar ", 13 miles away, and to go to Backman's house there. She
described the town and the house and its inmates, seeing a little boy
" double ". There v.'ere actually twins in the house. She then described
a young girl so exactly that Backman recognised a Miss H. W., whom he
had not supposed to be in the house. It was afterwards revealed that she
was not, but that his wife had been speaking to her at the time on the
telephone.
Anna was " led " in the usual verbal way to the house of the Quarter-
master and described correctly who was there and what the Quarter-
master was doing, mentioning a long stick leaning against the wall.
Lottery numbers were foretold and half were right.
Alma Radberg is described as being a pious and good girl with some
intelligence and not hysterical, but highly suggestible both when awake
and when hypnotised. She was so suggestible that it is stated that a blister
was produced on her skin by cold water, which, it was suggested, was
burning sealing wax.
Alma was usually asked to describe the interiors of distant houses and to
86 The Modus Operandi of [Part
say what was going on there. She was " sent " to the house of the Director
General of Pilotage at Stockholm, where neither she nor Dr Backman
himself nor his wife, who was present, had ever been. She described the
interior of the principal room minutely and correctly. She then described
the house of Captain Smith in Norrkoping. After waking, she described
these two houses still more distinctly.
On another occasion. Alma was " sent " to the Director General's
house at Stockholm while he was there. She saw a bunch of keys on his
table and was told to shake them and to put her hand on his shoulder.
This was repeated two or three times. The Director General, before he
heard of the experiment, said that his attention had been fixed on the day
and hour because he had then had a strange experience. While occupied
with his work, he began to notice the keys. Then he caught a glimpse of a
woman. This was repeated, and he got up to look but found no one there.
The keys did not rattle or move. He discovered that no woman had really
been in the room.
In another experiment. Alma was asked to describe a prepared room at
Stockholm, and the people who were in it. A pair of scissors had been
hung by a rubber otoscope from the chandelier, which Alma described
approximately. She got the number of persons in the room right and
some other things wrong, but correctly described some of the furniture.
Dr Backman says that he sent his notes about the experiments made to
Dr Kjellman at Stockholm before he knew anything about the results, and
these notes were sent to the Editor of the S.P.R. Proceedings.
Two subjects together, Alma and Miss H. L., tried to describe the
interior of a prepared room in Stockholm. Miss H. L.'s statements were
all wrong, and Alma's were only partly right. It is worth while noticing
the vague kinds of approach which Alma makes to the appearance of the
objects in the room. For example a dead hen with a silver spoon in its
bill had been placed on a tray. Alma says : "on one corner of the table
there was a tray with small objects on it, long and yellow ". The hen was
yellow in colour. (See Proc. vii, 210-1.) All this suggests the creation of
mediating vehicles which only approximately convey the paranormal
knowledge.
In one experiment a paper with the word Hiitid written on it was placed
in his room by Dr Kjellman at a certain time every day for a week, and
Alma was asked to try to read it ivithout being hypnotised. Under these
conditions, she only got the first letter, H.
Agda Olsen, another sensitive of the same type, also remembered her
hypnotic experiences after waking. There had been a murder, and Agda
was told to see the murder, the murderer, his house and his motive. She
gave a fairly detailed account of these, afterwards corroborated by the
police. One statement, that a certain church could be seen from the
murderer's house, was said by the police to be incorrect. But Agda
said :
" The church of Wissefjerda is situated obliquely on your right
when you are standing in the passage." Backman says that this statement
is correct as to the bearing of the church. Agda did not say that it could be
seen from there.
When told to look in a crystal, Agda saw several things correctly.
There is an interesting account of an achievement by another sensitive
jyj] Paranormal Cognition 87
of the same type, Cecilia. A tiny silver revolver had been apparently
hopelessly lost in the sand. Cecilia was suggested with the idea that she
would be able to go and find it. She did so and brought it.
F. W. H. Myers and his party were not able to be with the sensitives
long enough to overcome their shyness in the presence of strangers.
Nevertheless they had two successes which they^ described as being
" decidedly corroborative of Dr Backman's results ".
At the beginning of his account, Dr Backman says :
"The experiments
to be recorded do not claim to be considered strictly scientific, but 1
describe them simply as I have made them, in the hope that others may be
incited to carry out similar attempts in a more systematic and scientific
manner than my practical occupations have given me time for." {Proc. vii
109.) This was written not later than 189 1. It is extraordinary that
scarcely any attempt should have been made since that date by our Society
to carry out experimental work on these lines.
Other experiments, somewhat casual in type, but all of the same kind,
are the following.
Mr T Criswick {Proc. vii, 94) said :
" I tried to send some persons to
sleep, etc. by gazing into their eyes, by passes from the head downwards,
etc and found several sensitive. One of those that was susceptible to the
influence was a Miss R. After falling into the so-called mesmeric sleep,
it was easy to induce her to talk, to get up, etc., and in her, as well as in
others, I was always struck by the improvement of expression during the .
sleep." He used verbal direction.
1, j t?
Mr J. J. T. Glover {Proc. vii, 95) hypnotised a young man called Cr. .
and obtained results by verbal direction.
„ , r- - j
Mr H T. Humphreys {Proc. vii, 96) hypnotised a man called bdward
Maguire. He says :
" I put him to sleep, and it then occurred to me to
try if he were clairvoyant." He was ; and " went " where directed.
Mrs Stella of Chieri {Proc. vii, 99) describes a visit to a sensitive who
was placed in a
" state of trance or mesmeric sleep ", and described her
stepson with details when given some of his hair as a psychometric object
There is also the remarkable Mexican sensitive, Senora Z., who worked
entirely with psychometric objects and who was visited and examined by
Dr Walter Prince {Proc. A.S.P.R. xv, 189-314 and xvi).
An important feature of these experiments lies in the mistakes and
inaccuracies of the sensitives. They are helpful in the study of the con-
struction of the mediating vehicle. In Case 19 Anna described a woman
as present in a house when she was really 20 kilometres away and was
speaking on the telephone. Here it looks as if the constructor of the
mediating vehicle, when in uncertain touch with paranormal knowledge,
was influenced by a rationalising faculty or by inference, and allowed this
faculty to play a part in the construction of the mediating vehicle. All this
is very unlike naive clairvoyance. The next case is interesting from this
point of view. .. .
20. An experiment was tried by Dr A. S. Wiltse {Proc. vu, 77) with a
sensitive named Fannie G. A man, well known in the part of Kansas
where he lived, as Uncle Julian Scott, had ridden into the Emerald River
and been drowned. Fannie G. was a servant girl whom Dr Wiltse
describes as being " an excellent subject for hypnotism". Having hypno-
88 The Modus Operandi of [Part
tised Fannie, Dr Wiltse asked her what had become of Uncle Julian. He
directed her verbally to the river, and took her slowly along it in an imag-
inary boat, telling her to look down into the water. At a certain place
she said there was a hat. " Soon after this she announced an object near
the left bank of the stream and asked to be paddled over there. Then asked
if we did not see an old tree-body under the water near the bank. Q. :
'
All right! Here we are! '
.... :
'
What is it Fannie.? '
F, :
'
Some
big dark thing ; I can't see what. There is a saddle there. Don't you
see it? '
Q. :
'
Yes, Fannie, what else.?' F. :
'
Something, but I can't
see it good ; the water is muddy. The saddle is there. I can see it, and
one stirrup is gone.' Q. :
'
All right. Can you see anything on the bank
that we may know the spot as we come back? '
F. :
'
Why, of course.
Don't you see how the sand is worked up in that low spot around the roots
of that tree?' " All this is not very valuable as evidence for paranormal
cognition, for Wiltse does not seem to be quite sure that the saddle was
ever found in the place described although it was generally supposed to
have been. But it is evidence of the circumstantial realism which the ex-
periences had from the percipient's point of view. It has the appearance
of clairvoyance.
Wiltse himself, however, witnesses to the accuracy of the rest of Fannie's
statements. They passed down the river on their imaginary journey until
Fannie said :
" '
It will be no use ever to look below right here! '
Q. :
'
All
right, Fannie. We will go back, but first show us some mark by which we
shall remember the place, can you? ' '
Why, don't you see? '
she ex-
claimed in a tone of seeming disgust. Q. :' What is it, Fannie? '
F. :
' Oh,
don't you see that tall bridge? '
Q. :
'
Where, Fannie? '
F. :
'
Why,
right there! We just now passed under it, right there it is.' " There was
only one bridge across the Emerald River in those parts, an iron railway
bridge, which Dr Wiltse says he was sure Fannie had never seen. It was
at a wild and almost inaccessible spot in the mountains several miles
away. When asked what kind of a bridge it was Fannie said it looked as if
it were made of iron. The body was actually found some dscys, later by a
train-hand, who saw it from a train crossing the bridge. It had lodged
upon an old drift just below the bridge. So Fannie was right in saying
that it would be useless to look for it lower down the river. This looks like
clairvoyance. But the interesting part of the case is yet to come. As
Fannie was being verbally directed home again after her imaginary voyage
on the river, a rumour was started that the body had been recovered and
taken to the house of Uncle Julian Scott's son. This rumour was whis-
pered to Dr Wiltse. Thereupon, in order to try an experiment, he said to
Fannie :
" Let's go into the Scott's and warm." Fannie agreed, and when
she seemed to herself to have entered the house, she said :
" Why, they
have found Uncle Julian and got him laid out." She then described the
relatives and friends who were there, and how they were crying, etc.
The whole of this scene, just as apparently real to Fannie as the river
scene, must have been obtained telepathically from the minds of the by-
standers, as there was no truth in it. But Fannie knew nothing of any
change in the source of her information. Can we really suppose that in the
river scene Fannie was clairvoyantly seeing the physical peculiarities and
details of the river by a kind of paranormal sight, while in the Scott's
173] Paranormal Cognition "
89
house she was witnessing a scene constructed to convey a general but
erroneous beUef in peoples' minds? Surely it is clear that in both cases
we are dealing with the same process, the creation of a hallucinatory
mediating vehicle which conveys information somehow held by the
subliminal self or selves of those concerned. Whether we call it " clair-
voyance " or " telepathy " is a matter of choice ; but it is not naive
clairvoyance or naive telepathy—it is neither thought-transference
between conscious minds nor paranormal perception of physical objects.
We do not know what paranormal cognition is behind the mediating
process, which is all that consciousness is concerned with.
21. The next is a remarkable dream-case reported to the Society by
Mr Dudley F. Walker {Journal xxiv, 379). It was a dream of a very
extraordinary kind, for the percipient says of his experience : "I might
mention it has made a deep impression on my mind, and although I have
never given serious thought to this subject, I am now perfectly convinced
that this was no ordinary dream. It was so remarkably true to life that it
seemed more like a vision of events taking place than an average dream."
This must be taken into account in any estimate of the probability that
chance might account for the coincidence between the dream and the
events. The question would be : How many dreams of railway accidents
had Mr Walker had which were so vivid and realistic that he felt compelled
to recount them on getting up in the morning, which made him say that
if he had had to make a railway journey that day he would have postponed
it, which impelled him to make a note of them in his diary, and which
made him feel too unwell to eat any breakfast, but which yet did not
correspond with any real events? It is clearly no use estimating (even if it
could be done) how often the subject of trains or railway accidents may
have flitted through Mr Walker's ordinary dreams, because this dream was
evidently not in the same category as ordinary dreams. Any statistical
calculation made on that basis would be merely misleading. In answer
to the question, " Have you ever had a similar dream? " Mr Walker
replied, " No. Never of an event which has actually taken place." Also
in reply to another question, Mr Walker added :
" I can most emphatically
assure you that I have never before dreamed of either a railway smash or
any other kind of violent accident, and, as a matter of fact have all my life
been a very rare dreamer. This has been a subject of remark in my family,
for I have often passed for months without ever dreaming at all—or at any
rate never having any remembrance of dreaming after waking. ..."
But the question is not merely how many^dreams of railway accidents
Mr Walker had had which had corresponded with no reality, but how
many he had had which contained all the details which this dream shared
with the reality. It is surely obvious to common sense that chance is an
absurd explanation, and to demand a mathematical demonstration of this
fact would be equally absurd.
As to the time-coincidence, the collision occurred about 11.20 p.m.,
and Mr Walker began to dream about it soon after he fell asleep at 10.30
p.m. and he seems to have gone on dreaming about it at intervals through
the night.
The following is Mr Walker's account of the dream. " I was in an
overhead signal-box extending over a railway line I had never seen before.
go The Modus Operandi of ^ [Part
It was night, and I saw approaching what I knew was an excursion train,
full of people returning from some big function. I knew it was my duty to
signal this train through, which I did, but at the same time I had a feeling
that the train was doomed. (I have nothing to do with railway work.)
In my dream I seemed to hover in the air and follow the express as it
slowed round a loop line. As it approached a station I saw, to my horror,
another small train on the same line. Although they seemed both travel-
ling slowly, they met with terrible impact. I saw the express and its
coaches pitch and twist in the air, and the noise was terrible. Afterwards,
I walked beside the wreckage in the dim light of dawn, viewing with a
feeling of terror the huge overturned engine and smashed coaches. I was
now amid an indescribable scene of horror, with dead and injured people,
and rescue workers everywhere.
Most of the bodies lying by the side of the track were those of women and
girls. As I passed with some unknown person leading me, I saw one man's
body in a ghastly state lifted out and laid on the side of an overturned
coach. . .
."
I am here concerned only with the light which cases of this kind can
throw on the modus operandi of paranormal cognition. There are features
in this case which assimilate it with cases of " travelhng clairvoyance ".
Mr Walker seemed to be in the overhead signal-box from which he saw
the train approaching. Then he seemed to be hovering in the air following
the express as it went round the loop line. Then he seemed to be walking
beside the wreckage. We have already dealt with the arguments against
the view that a non physical body, travelling through space and obtaining
a close-up view of events, can account for cases like this, and found it
unplausible. The question lies between a telepathic and a clairvoyant
explanation. In favour of the telepathic view we must note that all the
information which entered into the dream could have been obtained from
the minds of the signalman or others on the spot. Also, Mr Walker had a
curious feeling of being identified with the signalman. He says :
"... I
had an awful feeling of horror, and that it was my fault ; due to the fact,
no doubt, that I was under the impression that I was the signalman who
let the train through." Again, Mr Walker says :
"... I dreamt again
about being in the signal-box after having attended some official enquiry
in which I saw a number of men seated down each side of a long table."
Mr Walker says that in his dream he had a feeling that something was
wrong in the signal-box, owing to a clicking noise ; and the signalman,
Garrett, said that his attention was drawn to a clicking noise in the lever
frame. This feeling of being identified with the signalman strongly
suggests telepathy. The dream throughout was, of course, a dramatic
construct—a mediating vehicle—which conveyed the paranormally
acquired knowledge to consciousness.
Again, in this case the telepathic hypothesis does not suggest that any-
thing like naive " thought-transference " is taking place. It suggests that
the whole situation has been grasped, including both physical events and
mental or emotional states. Knowledge of the physical events need not
have been acquired by direct perception of physical objects, so long as any
minds were aware of these events. Had the dream been precognitive, it
might have been said that no one was aware of the events, and therefore
1 73] Paranormal Cognition 9^
telepathy could not be invoked. But, by similar reasoning, it could be said
that the physical events had not yet happened, and therefore clairvoyance
could not be invoked either. From this point of view naive telepathy and
naive clairvoyance are on a par. Actually, Mr Walker thought that he fell
asleep about 10.30 and began to dream about the accident at once, that is
about fifty minutes before it occurred. But I do not think we can be sure
that any part of the dream was really precognitive.
If we try to explain the dream by clairvoyance, we arrive at no explana-
tion of the feeling of identity with the signalman, and of sharing his
emotions. That, on the clairvoyant hypothesis, would have to be a
dramatic element imported to give atmosphere by the dream-constructor.
But the chief argument is that which we find in all spontaneous cases.
Why should Mr Walker's clairvoyant faculty have pitched on this event?
If the answer given is, Why should it not?, the counter reply is obviously
that if it did so it would surely pitch on a great many other events as well.
One can scarcely imagine that a clairvoyant faculty would emerge from
oblivion once in a lifetime, coincide with a remarkable event by chance,
and then retire again. For in this railway accident, the percipient had no
personal interest. There was nothing to guide a faculty of naive clair-
voyance to its goal. We have found nothing so far to suggest that clair-
voyance, in the sense of direct paranormal perception of physical events,
ever takes place. And I think it may be questioned whether information
received in the form of a dream is compatible with clairvoyance as ^bove
defined.
Precognition
If precognition be admitted to be a fact, naive telepathy and naive
clairvoyance at once become suspect. Precognition breaks away from
causality somewhere. Does it seem likely then, that telepathy and clair-
voyance, if they exist, are normally causal processes? Since telepathy is
apparently sometimes precognitive, and naive clairvoyance (if it exists) is
similarly sometimes precognitive, is it likely that these two forms of the
paranormal cognitive faculty are processes taking place in the world of time
and causality while precognition is a totally different kind of process which
breaks away from time and causality?
22. The following case of spontaneous precognition contains some infor-
mative features {Proc. v, 322).
Mrs J. Schweizer wrote as follows : "On the i8th July I had the
following dream or vision (I can't say which) :—I was walking on the
edge of a high cliff, the open sea in front, dear Fred and a stranger a little
in advance, when Fred slipped suddenly down the side of the cliff, and in
doing so gazed with the most intense anguish into my very soul. I shall
never forget that look. I turned to the stranger and said, '
May I ask who
you are and what is your name? '
He replied, '
My name is Henry
Irvin.' I said, '
Do you mean Irving the actor? '
He said, '
No, not
exactly : but something after that style.' I said, in reply, '
Now that I
look at you, you have the same agonized expression in your face that I have
so often noticed in Irving's photographs in the shop windows.' So I
awoke in a miserable state of mind. It was between 5 and 6 a.m. The
servants came down soon after. The dream seemed to haunt me ;
I
92 The Modus Operandi of [Part
could think of nothing else. When I met my eldest son, John, at breakfast,
I asked at once where was Fred? (I must state here that Fred was the
travelling partner of three brothers, and then in the north of England on a
journey.) His brother, after hearing the dream, said, '
Oh, Fred is all
right ; he is in Manchester.' He saw how miserable this dream made me
feel, and he promised at my request to '
wire '
to me when he got to his
counting house in case there was no letter from Fred, who was in the habit
of writing to the firm daily. There was, however, a letter as usual, and
when I received no telegram as arranged, I judged that dear Fred was all
right. Still the dream was present to my mind, and I thought of it con-
tinually. I begged of his brother to tell him to come home. In a day or
two I heard that he was at Leeds, and the ne.xt day after that, John, the
eldest brother said, '
Fred says he is going to take a week's holiday in
Scarborough ', when I at once exclaimed, '
I wish he were at home ; do
write to him to come back ; he has had holidays enough this year. I shall
write to him myself.' John said, '
Oh, don't ; let him enjoy himself.'
On this day, before I got out of bed at the same hour between 5 and 6 a.m.,
a person seemed to pass the side of my bed, and said into my ear in an
audible voice, '
You are not done with trouble yet.' I started up and
awoke, and related the matter at breakfast while talking of Fred to John,
and said, '
I think it was your father.' He said, '
Oh, nonsense, that is like
the dream you bothered me about a few days ago.' This was on the 23rd.
On the 24th John mentioned that he had a telegram from Fred to send on
^10, that he was enjoying himself immensely, that the weather was
glorious. I again wished he were at home, and John said, '
He will be
here on Friday next.' In the morning on the 26th I went to the letter-box
and found a telegram for John, which announced an accident to Fred.
John, however, did not like to tell me, and hurried off to the office. I
asked John the nature of the telegram, but he said '
Business '. On
arriving at his office there was a telegram of a similar kind from the hotel
proprietor at Scarborough. Poor Fred was dead at the time, as he only
survi\'ed the accident three hours. John and I set off at once, and found
all over, and next day it was proposed that we should visit the fatal spot.
His companion in that unfortunate excursion accompanied us. He sat
opposite to me in the carriage, and when I looked at him I remembered
the dream of the i8th and recognized the stranger who had the agonized
expression, and asked him at once if his name were '
Henry '. He said,
'
Yes, my name is Henry,' when I told the dream. He then said, '
The
most extraordinary part is, I am connected with the volunteers, and we
have private theatricals, and I recite, and am always on those occasions
introduced as Henry Irvin, jun.'
"
The account of the accident was recorded in the York Herald of 28th
July, 1882, as follows :
" Scarboro', Sad Death of a Gentleman Visitor.—
•
An accident of a melancholy character, and which unfortunately has been
attended with fatal results, occurred on Wednesday evening to a London
gentleman named Frederick Schweizer, who for the past few days has been
staying at the Grand Hotel. It appears that on the afternoon of that day
the deceased, along with a casual acquaintance named Deverell, who is
staying at the Castle Hotel, went for a ride on horseback along the beautiful
Forge Valley rides. When near Ayton, the deceased was somewhat in
173] Paranormal Cognition 93
advance of his companion, and it is surmised that his steed shied at a white
gate ;
anyhow he was thrown onto the road, and the horse galloped away.
His friend on getting up to him dismounted, and a passing carriage was
utihsed to convey him to his hotel. This was at six o'clock and three hours
subsequently the deceased expired, it is supposed from concussion of the
brain."
It will be seen that the dream occurred on the i8th July and the fatal
accident on the 26th, eight days later. During all this time Mrs Schweizer
was in a miserable state of anxiety about her son Fred and urged her other
son, John, to induce him to come home. On the 23rd she had the second
dreain or impression of a presence and a voice, which she thought was
that of her husband, warning her that her trouble was not over.
Edmund Gurney, in an interview with Mrs Schweizer, was favourably
impressed with her as a witness and says that the dream " certainly made
a very powerful impression on her ". In fact, like Mr Dudley Walker's,
it was no ordinary dream. As she says :
" The dream seemed to haunt
me ; I could think of nothing else."
From the point of view of the nature of paranormal cognition, one very
interesting feature of this dream is that it was so unlike the event to which
it corresponded. The scene of the dream-event was fictional, the high
cliiT, the open sea in front, her son, Fred, slipping down the side of the
cliff—none of this occurred. Yet its correspondence with the real event
is undoubted, partly because of the double warning and of the anxiety
which lasted till Fred's' death occurred, and partly because of the " Henry
Irvin " incident. This shows beyond all doubt that the drama on the
cliff was a dramatic creation, in other words a mediating vehicle, and not
any kind of direct perception of physical or conscious mental events. The
motive for this radical departure from physical fact is obscure. It suggests
that a dream-like association of ideas may have taken a part in constructing
the mediating vehicle. Fred was known to be at Scarborough, by the sea.
This was normal knowledge. Paranormally, his impending death by
accident was accessible in the subliminal. Perhaps the two kinds of
knowledge got together and created a picture of the most likely kind of
accident by the sea (especially if knowledge that there was a fall and con-
cussion was included), namely a fall from the cliffs. Horses were excluded
from the picture, perhaps because the presence.of horses on the edge of a
cliff would be incongruous. But the one thing that would connect this
vague dramatic construct with the real event quite unmistakably was
included, namely the face of Fred's companion (afterwards recognised by
Mrs Schweizer in the carriage) and his acting name, Henry Irvin.
Not only does this case show very clearly the existence of a mediating
vehicle : it also shows its " portmanteau " character. The paranormal
knowledge of Fred's impending death was certainly the instigating motive
and the dynamic force behind the experience. It set the mediating
machinery to work ; but it was only one factor in its actual construction.
Cases like this teach us not to regard precognition as a kind of time-
travelling vision which goes into the future and takes a peep at physical
events which have not yet happened. They teach us to look at it as a
" something " deep in the subliminal region, probably beyond time and
causality, and something therefore that we cannot grasp intellectually,
*
94 The Modus Operandi of [Part
which makes it possible for mediating vehicles to be created which have
reference to the future.
I shall not go on to quote other cases of precognition here, but shall pass
on to another phenomenon which sheds light on paranormal cognition.
Before doing so it will be well to summarise the conclusions to which the
evidence so far cited points.
(1) There is no valid evidence for the existence of a faculty of" thought-
transference " in which thoughts or ideas pass from one conscious mind to
another. The evidence points to a sharing by subliminal selves of a very
wide and general kind of knowledge which can be mediated to conscious-
ness by means of various types of psychologically created vehicles
—
sensory, impulsive, emotional, verbal.
The faculty can be called " telepathy ", but only in a sense greatly
extended from that implied by the term " thought-transference ".
(2) There is no valid evidence for the existence of a faculty of " clair-
voyance " in the sense of a paranormal, perceptual faculty by means of
which physical objects or events can be directly perceived. This hypo-
thesis fails, on the whole, to explain both spontaneous and experimental
evidence.
(3) There is valid evidence for the existence of a faculty of precognition.
This rests on a large amount of spontaneous and experimental evidence,
of which only one example has been cited above. Once precognition is
granted, it is in itself a powerful argument against the existence of what
have here been called " naive telepathy " and " naive clairvoyance ",
since both of these presuppose that paranormal cognition deals directly
with events in the space-time world (assuming conscious thought to have
a physical counterpart in the brain), while precognition points to the view
that paranormal cognition takes place (or exists or has being of some sort)
outside the space-time world, and is mediated into it by means of a
secondary process.
These conclusions apply to the types of evidence we have so far been
considering. The evidence of statistical methods of research will be
considered presently, and the question of whether their results agree with
the above, and, if not, why they diifer, will be discussed.
PSYCHOMETRY "
Several things in the experimental field which would throw light on
paranormal cognition have been left almost untouched. One of these is
" psychometry ". In psychometry, a material object plays an uncom-
prehended part in the production of paranormal cognition. Here, surely,
is something to be followed up. What part does it play? What is the
connection between paranormal knowledge and a piece of matter.? Most
of the sensitives who took part in the experimental work referred to above
—
" Jane ", Anna Samuelsson, Alma Radberg, Agda Olson, Cecilia, and
Fanny G.—were verbally directed to their objectives. But other sensitives
have been directed to their objectives by holding or being otherwise
associated with an object. Two cases of this kind were reported by Mr
A. W. Dobbie, an Associate of the S.P.R. living in Adelaide. When he
was in England, we are told that Mrs Sidgwick examined his note book.
173] Paranormal Cognition 95
23 . Mr Dobbie practised hypnotism for ten or twelve years and found him-
self to be a very successful operator. He says that he hypnotised more than
500 persons, chiefly with a view to alleviating suffering, and found that a
few of his patients were capable of clairvoyance (Proc. vii, 64). The sensi-
tives employed in the following experiments were Eliza and Martha Dixon.
In cases of psychometry, the sensitive holds, or becomes otherwise
associated with, an object which some person has previously touched, and
is then able to give information concerning the past history of the object
and of the person who has touched it. It is convenient to have a name for
this person, and I shall call him the " contactor ". It is unfortunate that
the second of these cases, which contains a very significant feature, is less
well evidenced than the first. But the way in which the lost pencil-case
was found can scarcely be untrue. Witnesses of the first case were the
Hon. Dr Campbell, M.L.C., the Hon. David Murray, M.L.C., and Chief
Secretary of South Australia, Mr Lyall, and Mr Fleming, solicitor.
Dr Campbell handed Mr Dobbie a gold sleeve-link, whose fellow had
been lost, and asked if a clairvoyant could find the missing one. Mr
Dobbie says :
" I should state that neither of the clairvoyants had ever
seen either of the rooms they referred to, nor did they know the names of
the children, or anything in connection with this case. . .
." The link was
first handed to Martha Dixon who began by giving an accurate description
of Dr Campbell's features (the contactor). She then spoke of a little fair-
haired boy called " Neil " who had the link in his nursery and dropped it
into a hole which had been torn in the breast of a toy elephant.
Then occurred an interval of two or three days, during which the missing
link was found, but left untouched. At the next sitting Eliza and Martha
joined hands, and Eliza immediately spoke as follows, this time in Dr
Campbell's presence :
' " I am in a house, upstairs, I was in a bathroom,
then I went into another room nearly opposite, there is a large mirror just
inside the door on the left hand, there is a double sized dressing-table
with drawers down each side of it, the sleeve-link is in the corner of the
drawer nearest the door. When they found it they left it there. I know
why they left it there, it was because they wanted to see if we would find it.
I can see a nice easy chair there, it is an old one, I would like it when I am
put to sleep because it is nice and low. The bed has curtains, they are a
sort of brownish net and have a fringe of darker brown. The wall paper
is of a light blue colour. There is a cane lounge there and a pretty
Japanese screen behind it, the screen folds up. There is a portrait of an
old gentleman over the mantelpiece, he is dead, I knew him when he was
alive, his name is the same as the gentleman who acts as Governor when the
Governor is absent from the Colony, I will tell you his name directly—it is
the Rev. Mr Way. It was a little boy who put the sleeve-link in that
drawer. He is very fair, his hair is almost white, he is a pretty little boy,
he has blue eyes and about three }'ears old. The link had been left on that
table, the little boy was in the nursery, and he went into the bedroom after
the gentleman had left. I can see who the gentleman is, it is Dr Campbell.
Doesn't that little boy look a young Turk, the link is quite a handful for his
little hand, he is running about with it very pleased ; But he doesn't seem
to know what to do with it. (A)
(Dr Campbell was not present from this point.)
96 The Modus Operandi of [Part
" Now I can hear someone calling up the stairs, a lady is calling two
names, Colin is one and Neil is the other, the other boy is about five years
old and is darker than the other. The eldest, Colin, is going downstairs
now, he is gone into what looks like a dining-room, the lady says, '
Where
is Neil? ' '
Upstairs, Ma.' '
Go and tell him to come down at once.'
The little fair haired boy had put the link down ; but when he heard his
brother coming up, he picked it up again. Colin says
—' Neil, you are to
come down at once.' '
I won't,' says Neil. '
You're a goose,' replies
Colin, and he turned and went down without Neil. What a young
monkey! Now he is gone into the nursery and put the link into a large
toy elephant, he put it through a hole in front which is broken. He has
gone downstairs now, I suppose he thinks it is safe there. Now that
gentleman has come into the room again and he wants that link ; he is
looking all about for it, he thinks it might be knocked down : the lady is
there, too, and they are both looking for it. The lady says
—' Are you
sure you put it there? '
The gentleman says, '
Yes.'
" Now it seems like next day. The servant is turning the carpet up and
looking all about for it, but. can't find it. The gentleman is asking that
young Turk if he has seen it, he knows that he is fond of pretty things.
The little boy says, '
No.' He seems to think it is fine fun to serve his
father like that. Now it seems to be another day and the little boy is in the
nursery again, he has taken the link out of the elephant, now he has dropped
it into that drawer, that is all I have to tell you about it, I told you the rest
before."
i8th July, 1886. " Since writing the above pages I have handed them
to Dr Campbell for perusal, so that he might check the account and ratify
it or otherwise, and after going carefully through it, he has returned it to
me accompanied by a complete ratification in writing, which I herewith
enclose. A. W. Dobbie."
Memo, by Dr Campbell.
" Adelaide, 9th July, 1886.
" At the point (A) the seance was discontinued till the next sitting when,
I was absent. The conversation reported as passing between the children
is correct in every point. The portrait is that of the late Rev. James Way.
The description of the children and their names are true. The fact that
the link was discovered in the drawer, in the interval between one sitting
and the final one, and that the link was left there pending the discovery of
it by the clairvoyant is also correct, as this was my suggestion to Mrs
Campbell when she showed it to me in the corner of the drawer. In fact,
every circumstance reported is absolutely correct. I know, further, that
neither of the clairvoyants has ever been inside of my door. My children
are utterly unknown to them, either in appearance or by name. I may say
also that they had no knowledge of my intention to place the link in their
possession, or even of my presence at the seance, as they were both on each
occasion in a mesmeric sleep when I arrived—Allan Campbell."
In a later letter, dated i6th December, 1887, Dr Campbell writes :
" Dear Mr Dobbie,—Your London correspondent asks if I had any
knowledge of the conversation that the clairvoyant stated had passed
between the children. I have no knowledge whatever of this conversation,
nor the circumstances attending it, until she repeated it. It was subse-
173] Paranormal Cognition 97
quently confirmed to me in part by Mrs Campbell, such part as she
herself is reported to have taken in the tableau. With respect to the large
toy elephant, I certainly knew of its existence, but was not thinking of it
at the time the clairvoyant was speaking. I did not know even by suspicion
that the elephant was so mutilated as to have a large opening in its chest,
and on coming home had to examine the toy to see whether the statement
was correct. I need hardly say that it was absolutely correct. —I am. Yours
sincerely, Allan Campbell."
With regard to the difference between this method of experimenting on
paranormal cognition and the commoner method of voluntary telepathy,
in which the agent thinks of the thing to be transmitted to the percipient,
the following remark of Mr Bobbie's is relevant. " I have scores of times
tried my level best to cause clairvoyants to see pictures and visions by
conjuring up in my own mind the most vivid pictures imaginable, but up
to the present moment I have never succeeded in making my clairvoyants
think one thought or say or see anything I have tried to make them see in
that way."
I have quoted this rather lengthy case because it shows that the para-
normal cognitive faculty is not like naive telepathy or naive clairvoyance.
A good deal of the information lay within the knowledge of Dr Campbell.
Some of it was unverifiable. The conversation between the children was
not known to him, but some of it was verified by Mrs Campbell. The
hole in the toy elephant was, at the time, only known to the child. The
telepathic hypothesis therefore involves a kind of dipping into minds just
as is convenient to piece together the entire episode. I suggest that the
kind of telepathy which really exists (if it merits the name at all) is not a
faculty which dips into this conscious mind and that and fits together the
isolated pieces of information it finds, but that the knowledge exists in a
wide and general form in the subliminal selves of those concerned, as was
pointed out when dealing with Case 13. The scenes and the conversations
which the percipient experienced were constructed to mediate this general
knowledge to her consciousness.
Can this case be explained by naive clairvoyance.' The correct descrip-
tion of the details of the interior of a house unknown to the percipient
may seem at first to suggest it. But the events described as if the per-
cipient were witnessing them were in the past, not in the present, and this
rules out naive clairvoyance, as was pointed out on p. 82. The source
of the knowledge is very obscure. We can, if we like, stretch either term,
telepathy or clairvoyance, to cover it : but the faculty is quite unlike
" thought-transference " and it is quite unlike sense-perception of
physical events.
The really novel feature about this case, however, as compared to the
cases we have previously considered, is that the faculty of the sensitive was
directed by the sleeve-link which she held.
Another case with the same sensitive contains an extremely interesting
feature. Unfortunately it was not so carefully noted at the time as was the
above case ;
yet this interesting feature must surely have occurred.
{Proc. vii, 68.) Mr. Dobbie says :
24. " One evening, whilst I was busy with several of my clairvoyants,
Mr Adamson, J. P. (one of the leading citizens of Adelaide), called, in
G
98 The Modus Operandi of [Part
company with his daughter, and, handing me two or three trinkets which
had been suspended to her watch chain, simply remarked, 'We have lost
something. Will you kindly see if your clairvoyant can help us in the
matter? '
My clairvoyants all being asleep, I quietly placed the trinkets
in the hand of the one called Miss E. Dixon without remark. In a moment
or two she proceeded to give an accurate description of the young lady
who owned the trinkets. I then said, '
Never mind the young lady,
something is lost ;
try and find it.'
" In a few moments she commenced to describe a gold pencil-case
which she saw '
lying on the road in one of the suburbs, not in the city,
it is not there now, it is in a comfortable looking one-storey house with a
garden and iron railings opposite.' She then described the gentleman who
had possession of the pencil-case, whom she saw with his wife, and also
quoted a remark he made, '
We will lay it aside and see if anyone claims
it,' and stated that it was placed '
in a small box '. My clairvoyant seemed
unable to give me the locality of this gentleman and his house ;
however,
in reply to an advertisement next day or day after, a gentleman answering
the description given by my clairvoyant brought the lost pencil-case to
Mr Adamson, who, naturally enough, was so astounded at the correct
description of a person none of us had ever seen or known, that he took the
trani and visited the neighbourhood and house in which the gentleman
resided, and to his astonishment he found that the description was exact,
in fact, it was the only house in the neighbourhood having iron railings,
also that there actually was a two-storey house opposite, which was also
the only one in the neighbourhood. Mr Adamson, on questioning the
gentleman, found that the pencil-case was found on the road as described ;
also that it has been placed in the small box and the remark made re
waiting to '
see if it would be claimed '
by the gentleman.
" To still further test the genuineness of the clairvoyance, I arranged
(quite unknown to my clairvoyant, of course) to have the said gentleman
present with about twelve other persons, who all entered the room after I
had put my clairvoyant to sleep, and, on placing the trinkets and pencil-
case in her hands again, she immediately found herself at the same house
again and saw the same gentleman. I then instructed her to remember
(my subjects never remember anything when they wake up unless I
instruct them to do so) the features of this gentleman, so that if ever she
should meet him in the future she would recognize him. I then woke her
up, and to the astonishment and delight of all present, she at once volun-
tarily recognized the gentleman as the one she had seen when mesmerised.
Of course you will see at once that the fact of the clairvoyant recognizing
the gentlemian is not of itself of much scientific value because the fact
that I by this time knew the features of the gentleman makes it possible
to bring that part of the" experiment under the category of thought-
transference, but taken in conjunction with the previous parts, I think the
idea of thought-transference may be discarded. ... A. W. Dobbie."
The following statement, Mr Dobbie tells us, was handed to him by Mr
Adamson on 8th March, 1886 :
" Dear Sir . . . Passing your house one
evening, in company with a daughter, who had lost a trinket off her watch-
chain a week or so previous, and who lamented its loss, not on account of
intrinsic value, but as an old keep-sake, I said to her :
'
Come in and see
173] Paranormal Cognition 99
if Mr Dobbie can find it for you.' You had three clairvoyants asleep when
we entered your room ;
shortly afterwards you placed the trinkets in the
hand of one of them, a female. Soon after which she began a fair descrip-
tion of my daughter ; this you stopped, informing her that something was
lost which we wanted to find. She was silent for a minute or two, and
then said :
'
I think I see it now. It was in the dust and a man has found
it.' The question was put :
'
What is it.-"
'
She answered, '
A ring ;
there is something on it ; it is not a key, Oh! it's a pencil-case ; its bright
and shining.' She was then asked to follow the man home. This caused
a long silence. At length she said :
'
I am there now ; he is showing it to
a woman. I think it is his wife. He is putting it in a box and saying, '
We
will leave it there and see what comes of it.' " She then said more than
once, '
They would give it up if they knew who it belonged to, they do not
want to keep it ;
Oh, I wish I could take it away, they seem honest
people.' She then, in answer to questions put, described the house in
which the people lived, and the neighbourhood exactly, but could not give
the locality, as she had never been there before—described the house as
old and comfortable, like within a garden, a wrought-iron railing in front;
no church could be seen from the gate, but a large two-storey building
opposite. She described the man accurately who had the pencil-case, and
advised advertising for its recovery, as she was sure of its return if it was
known who was the owner. A. Adamson."
The remarkable feature of this case is that the sensitive never had the
gold pencil-case in her hand or anywhere near her until after it had been
found. She only held the trinkets which had been suspended from the
same ring as the pencil-case before it was lost. Whatever guiding influence
the trinkets exerted in the matter of finding the pencil-case must, according
to our way of thinking, have been exerted backwards in time through the
moment when the trinkets and the pencil-case were last on the ring
together. The trinkets had never been through the experience, which, so
to speak, the pencil-case had ;
they had never been in contact with the
finder of the pencil-case and therefore could not directly link the sensitive
with him. On the other hand, the pencil-case, which had been in contact
with him, had not been seen or touched by the sensitive at the time when
she described his finding it.
If the pencil-case was causally efficacious in directing the sensitive's
faculty to the man who found it, the cause must here have been acting
in a very peculiar way. It must have been acting backwards in time to the
moment when the pencil-case and the trinkets were last together, and then
forwards in time through the trinkets. Apparently, this would involve a
causal sequence passing from the time of the finding of the pencil-case
back through the moment when it and the trinkets were last on the ring
together, and then forwards to the moment when the sensitive held the
trinkets in her hand. This is quite different from the condition under
which " psychometry " usually takes place. Usually, the sensitive is
given an object to hold and then speaks of a person who has touched this
object in the past. Notice that the first thing Eliza Dixon did in this case
when given the trinkets to hold, was to describe Miss Adamson, their
owner. It was only by a lucky chance that the case brought to light the
fact that the influence of the object, whatever it is, can act backwards as^
lOO The Modus Operandi of [Part
well as forwards in time. Note too, that verbal direction works here in the
same way as it did with " Jane " and with Backman's subjects, only now
it is superimposed on the influence of the object. Eliza Dixon first speaks
of the owner of the trinkets. Then, being verbally directed to look for
something which had been lost, she switches on to the guiding influence of
the pencil-case and trinkets combined. Yet I do not think we can say it is
a case of verbal direction only. To all appearance, the lost pencil-case
really was eifective, through its association with the trinkets, in bringing
about its own discovery.
I shall now quote another case illustrating this retrograde temporal
action of the psychometric object, and I would direct special attention to it.
It is an experiment carried out by Dr Eugene Osty.
Before leaving the evidence of our own Proceedings and Journal, and
turning to that of Osty, I must, however, say something about the legiti-
macy of doing so. The work done by Osty, and published in a summarised
form in his book La Comiaissance Supra-Normale, translated (not too well,
it seems to me) under the title Supernormal Faculties in Man, throws
much light on paranormal cognition. It is a misnomer to call this work an
observation of " spontaneous " phenomena. It was, on the whole,
experimental, although the phenomena were by no means under the
complete control of the investigator. If they had been, the results would
have lost nearly all their value. But undoubtedly Osty's work was of a
preliminary nature. His somewhat rough and sketchy experiments could
have been followed up more carefully and more according to plan. In
fact, a careful study of them should have preceded any subsequent
experimental work in paranormal cognition. Statistical workers made a
great mistake, in my opinion, in breaking with the past and attempting
to make a new start along novel lines. At any rate, they made a great
mistake in regarding their new start as a main attack on the' problems of
paranormal cognition.
The above book of Osty's was rather unsympathetically reviewed by
Dr F. C. S. Schiller in Proc. xxxiv, 333. Schiller complains that Osty
has merely given condensations of his cases and that in no case has he
published his full notes. It is not possible, of course, to include the full
notes of cases in a book which is intended to be generally readable and of
reasonable length, but he might, perhaps, have published the full notes of
a sample case. In any case, it is a pity that Osty's executors should not
have made his notes available to students of psychical research. Perhaps
the war was responsible for this.
Osty himself regarded his work and his theoretical interpretation of it
as tentative. Speaking of the latter, he says : "I put it forward for the
sake of the fruitful work that it suggests. ..." He recognizes, too, the
gaps in his work. " I might have filled in these serious gaps," he says,
" by continuing my solitary work. But the matter of this study is so
extensive and of such high interest, that I have thought it better to publish
at once the verifications hitherto made, and thus to indicate to other
experimenters a main line and various branches of research, by which they
may, without waste of time and effort, proceed to the exploration of the
latent and transcendental zones of human thought." This was written in
1922. It is extraordinary that investigators should have turned away from
173] Paranormal Cognition 10
1
this promising lead, and, without studying its implications, have introduced
a new and altogether different line of experimental research.
I shall in this paper regard Osty's work and the conclusions he comes
to as valid guides.
25. A highly significant experiment is recorded in an article entitled
Premonitions a Longues Echeance, which appeared in the Revue Meta-
psychique for November and December, 1936, p. 470. The experiment
took place in the rooms of the Institiit Metapsychique International in the
Avenue Niel, Paris, on 21st April, 1926.
At 2.30 p.m. on that day, M. Humblot, a Member of the French Senate,
Mme Camille Flammarion, and Dr E. Osty were together in the Lecture
Hall, in which were about 150 chairs. M. Humblot walked down the gang-
way and pointed out a chair at random, when asked by Dr Osty to do so.
The latter then marked it by sticking a piece of gummed paper under it.
M. P. Forthuny, the sensitive, was then summoned. The marked chair
was pointed out to him, and he was left with Dr Osty's secretary and a
stenographer, who were instructed to admit no one and to take down all
that passed. Forthuny sat in the marked chair and felt it and the neigh-
bouring chairs on each side with the object of trying to learn something
about the persons who would sit in them at the coming meeting, to be held
in about an hour's time. Never, we are told, had he spoken so fast as when
describing his impressions. He had much to say about the future occupant
of the chair he was sitting on. All he said was taken down in shorthand.
Then, at 3.30, Forthuny went upstairs to Dr Osty's private room on the
second floor and stayed there with him and Mme Flammarion, while all
he had said was typed out by the secretary in the adjoining office.
At 3.30 p.m. about fifty people were waiting outside the lecture hall and
on the first-floor landing, and when the doors were opened, they poured in.
By 4 o'clock, about 200 people had arrived and found seats where they
could. M. Humblot left the I.M.I, before Forthuny quitted the lecture
hall. " The six persons who knew the selected chair remained until
4 p.m. without having any contact with the audience and took their places
in the hall at their choice, according to the free chairs."
At 4 p.m. Dr Osty told the audience about the experiment, and indicated
the marked chair, whose occupant was, not unnaturally, " quelque
emue ". The mark on the chair was verified. Then M Forthuny read
aloud his remarks about the occupants of the chairs with which he had
been in contact. Mme M., the occupant of the chair he had been sitting
on, was a very intelligent young woman, having a practical mind (d 'esprit
positif), who was not content with " nearly ", but anxious that the case
should be rendered as accurate as possible.
Forthuny had the following to say about her :
(1) A statement about something which Mme M. said corresponded
absolutely with the reality, but which she asked should not be made
public.
(2) Your project of going away in the summer has been stopped, and will
be again. Think no more of the east ; for the time it is over.
Mme M. had two projects for the summer holidays, a fortnight's motor
tour, already abandoned, and another to the Vosges, also abandoned.
(3)
" Before everything, take care of your graves. . .
."
I02 The Modus Operandi of [Part
Mme M. was not fond of visiting graves. Although her mother had
died tvi'O years ago, she had only once visited her grave, eight days after
the funeral.
(4)
" Leon ... is given to me : the chemist, I do not know why . .
."
This meant nothing, and was the only erroneous statement.
. (5)
" Take care of your liver. ..."
Mme M. was under treatment for liver trouble. ,
•
(6)
" Don't wear that belt ; it has already hurt you. . .
." •
Mme M. was wearing an elastic belt, which had hurt her skin.
(7)
" What a disturbance! You have been almost thrown to the ground
morally. You have been trampled on and dragged in the dust. You have
done very well to get up by yourself. The capital letter M. ... If you
could recover all your poise, you could live your life without emotion. ..."
Mme M. had a business partner, a woman M. R., who was unjustly-
jealous and had attacked her violently. She had morally thrown her down,
trampled on her and rolled her on the ground. She had even threatened
to kill her. At first Mme M. had thought of going away to escape, but in
the end she reacted and defended herself, showing her enemy and others
how unjust the indictments were. After having lost her poise, she had
gradually recovered it, which enabled her better to re-establish calm all
about her. •
(8)
" Pay attention to a return of the affection of your ears, throat and
nose. Your neuralgia arises only from that. . .
."
Mme M. had suffered from neuralgia for a long time. A few days
previously she had seen a nose, throat and ear specialist who had said that
if these organs were put right, the neuralgia would disappear.
(9)
" So much the worse for the one in prison, I mean a moral prison
in which he is shut up. He will come out of it by himself from-the know-
ledge that he is making others suffer. Then you will find all your free-
dom."
Because of the unjust attacks on his wife, the husband of Mme M. had
retired completely into himself, only speaking when strictly necessary.
This had put Mme M. into a state of painful constraint. Her husband
said that his behaviour had been excessive, and he gradually came out of
his voluntary, moral imprisonment. Mme M. gained in proportion
freedom from her constrained attitude.
(10) " Do not complain that this title had been withdrawn. All that is
only human vanity."
Mme M. was at that time interested because several clairvoyants had
told her that she came of a titled family. Knowing that her mother was
an abandoned child, she was intrigued by this and had made some in-
quiries to check the statements of the clairvoyants.
(11) " Beyond the equator, far across the seas, beyond the seas, a scent
of vanilla. . . . Very astonished to see someone return from Brazil or from
the Argentine . . . from South America in any case. . . . You were in
close contact with that person. ..."
Eight days before the meeting, Mme M. had been visited, without
notice, by a very good friend of her fami ly, who, after four years, had arrived
from Brazil.
(12) " The threat of an operation will return. ..."
173] Paranormal Cognition 103
Two months before the meeting, Mme M.'s doctor had said to her,
" You will have to have an operation one day."
I do not think it is necessary to waste time over the suggestion that all
these coincidences might be due to chance. For those who say that they can
form no estimate of what may be due to chance unless they have a proba-
bility-figure to guide them, it would be possible to carry out a control
experiment by getting someone to make twelve statements about the life
of a person and then seeing how they applied to some person taken at
random. Also the above is only a bald summary. Osty says : "A relire
ici les indications metagnomiques, confrontees avec les evenements qu'ils
signaleront, ils vont se rendre compte combien les mots exprimes par le
metagnome contiennent plus de signification qu'ils semblaient en avoir."
Having confirmed Forthuny's statements, Mme M. was asked to
describe how she got to the marked chair. Her account was given verbally
and in writing and confirmed in part by her business partner, M. R.
She said that both Dr Osty and M. Forthuny had been completely
unknown to her, and that it was by reading a case in the Reviie Meta-
psychtque that M. Forthuny's sittings were disclosed to her and her business
partner. On the day of the meeting, up to 12.30 p.m. she had no intention
of going to it, and did not even know on which day the meeting was.
M. R. (her partner) told her of it during lunch, and she decided to go to
the I.M.I., cancelling for the purpose an appointment with her nose-and-
throat specialist. About 2.30 she was seized with shortness of breath, a
thing as a rule she never had, and it upset her. She told her colleague of
this, who advised her to rest. About 3 o'clock, although she was busy, her
attention was constantly attracted to the hands of the clock. She felt as if
something was hurrying her to go. Nevertheless, her indisposition
continued and made her wonder whether it would not be better to rest in
her office. At 3 o'clock, however, she started out for the Avenue Niel,
and her breathing trouble stopped at once. At 3.20 she arrived at the
I.M.I., and found a crowd of people assembled at the closed door of the
hall. She took her place in the crowd and at about 3.30 the doors were
opened. Caught in the crowd, she brought up, having been carried along,
jostled and encountering some difficulty, at a chair which she found within
reach. As it v/as, someone else nearly sat in the chair before her. Reflect-
ing on this fact, she thought how man)^ incidents could have prevented the
thing from happening. Her indisposition nearly kept her from coming.
She was also expecting on that day important foreign clients, who actually
arrived, but after her departure from her office. Had they arrived while
she was still there, they would have prevented her from coming. The
unexpected refusal of the business colleague to accompany her to the
Avenue Niel nearly stopped her as well, since she disliked going about
alone. Besides this, it was the jostling of the crowd which determined
the chair she ultimately reached. And if her colleague had accompanied
her they would have required two chairs, and that would have meant
going to one of the back rows.
This experiment, it should be noted, would have been very difficult to
" rig ". If one thinks of what normal explanation would have been
reasonably possible, it is very hard to find one. Mme M. declared that she
did not know M. Forthuny before the experiment ; but suppose that he
104 The Modus Operandi of [Part
knew her, and that Mme M.'s account of how she came to the meeting
and reached the chair was a tissue of falsehoods, still we have to admit that
nothing could have been planned beforehand. The experiment was
suddenly sprung on M. Forthuny soon after 2.30 p.m., when he was asked
to come into the hall and sit on a particular chair. He remained there till
3.30 and then went straight upstairs to Dr Osty's private room, where he
stayed in the company of Osty himself and Mme Flammarion until every-
one was seated in the lecture hall. If the case is to be explained by fraud
and collusion, it must be assumed that Forthuny, as he sat in the chair,
decided to describe Mme M. whom he knew intimately. He would have
to trust to luck that he would be able to get in touch with her in time and
persuade her to come to the meeting and sit in that particular chair, whose
position he must have memorised by number and row. To do this under
constant supervision would have been difficult indeed. One would
have to suppose that he managed somehow to slip away and telephone
to her. Even then, the chances were that someone else would have sat
in the chair before she got to it, as, indeed, nearly happened according
to her account. To all this, Mme M.'s partner, M. R., must have been a
confederate, for she corroborated part of the former's statement of how
she went to the meeting. How could he persuade M. R..? He must have
persuaded Mme M. to persuade her during the supposed telephone
conversation.
Would a sane and reputable person, as M. Forthuny undoubtedly was,
have risked his reputation on a chance so extremely unlikely to come off,
even if we admit Mme M.'s willingness to be his confederate.? The fact
is that this case must be a sound piece of evidence, unless we regard the
whole account as a piece of deliberate fiction, which, in view of our know-
ledge of Osty, would be unreasonable to the point of absurdity. Also, if
the account had been untrue, the persons named in it would have protested.
Accepting the case, we have in it a parallel to the previous example,
without the complication of the trinkets ; that is to say, the cases would be
parallel if Eliza Dixon had held the pencil-case before it was lost and told
the story of its loss and recovery before it happened. In the marked-chair
case, causality appears to have acted backwards in time from the moment
when Mme M. sat on the chair to the earlier time when M. Forthuny sat
on it. Mme M. was the contactor of a psychometric object, which was the
chair. Usually, the contactor touches the object first and the sensitive
touches it afterwards. Then the sensitive is able to give information
about the contactor and about the previous history of the object. In this
case the order of events was reversed, but still the sensitive was able to
give information about the contactor. This is what makes the case so
interesting. The difficulty about causality acting baclcwards in time,
always present in cases of precognition, is present in a case like this in a
more inescapable form ; for in ordinary cases of precognition it is some-
times possible to argue that the information may have been due to subtle
inference or the like, but here the causal efficacy of the object, whatever
it may be, seems to be much more clearly exerted from future to present.
One other feature of the case is worthy of notice. At about 2.30 Mme
M. was seized with a mysterious shortness of breath which cured itself
at once when she started for the Avenue Niel. Also she had a feeling of
I "7^]
'
Paranormal Cognition 105
being hurried off : something kept urging her to look at the clock. All
this sounds very much like telepathy from M. Forthuny. But if so, it
must have been directed by the link, still in the future, of the moment
when Mme M. would sit on the chair that M. Forthuny was then sitting
on.
Osty had much experience of sensitives who worked with a psycho-
metric object, and he summarises his conclusions about the function
fulfilled by the object on pp. 13 1-2 of Supernormal Faculties in Man.
The gist of these conclusions is as follows :
In the first place, the object fulfils the same function as bodily contact
between sensitive and contactor, but does not have so powerful an
eff'ect.
(1) The essential thing is that the object should have been touched by
the person in question.
(2) Duration of contact does not matter. The degree of success
attained by the sensitive depends on the character of the contactor,
although with one sensitive, Mme Morel, frequency of contact by the
contactor did seem to improve the results.
(3) Each of the persons who has touched the object is perceived
separately. One is not confused by the sensitive with another.
(4) If a person touches an object, his whole life is thereby thrown open
to the sensitive. He may have touched it twenty years ago, yet his fife
since that date is perceived by the sensitive. Even events in his life which
are still in the future at the moment when the sensitive touches the object
can be foreseen.
(5) Persons who are connected with the contactor can also be perceived
by the sensitive, though more rarely.
(6) As soon as the sensitive has begun to perceive the contactor, the
object can be destroyed. The sensitive can still give information as if he
were still touching the object, and about events after it was destroyed.
(7) The physical and chemical nature of the object appears to make no
difference.
(8) Lapse of time since the contactor touched the object does not appear
to lessen the efficacy.
(9) If objects are placed in contact with one another, this does not
affect their efficacy : nor do objects placed in contact with one another
appear to convey their efficacy for the sensitive to each other.
(10) An error made about a person during a sitting with bodily contact
between sensitive and sitter will persist if an object is afterwards used
instead.
The following conclusions seem to be justified:
(i) Bodily contact between a certain type of sensitive and a sitter
facilitates paranormal cognition of the whole life of that sitter.
(11) A psychometric object fulfils the same function as direct bodily
contact, though less efficiently.
(iii) The object does not convey information which has been in some
way engraved on it ; it merely canalises the paranormal cognitive faculty
into a given channel.
(iv) The psychometric object is a part cause in the result, since the
object determines what kind of information the sensitive will give : also
Modus Operandi o/ .
'. '
[Part
some sensitives can do nothing without such an object. But this causality
can act either from past to present or from future to present.
This last statement sounds rather preposterous. It is worth while
showing Osty's conclusions and the results of cases 24 and 2? in the form
of simple diagrams.

When the sensitive touches the object at U the whole of the contactor's
hie is laid open to him throughout the periojd t^~t^. It would be interesting
to discover by experiment (since the fact of the contactor's touching the
object at appears to be a crucial condition) whether the entire period

The view that events are in some normally causal way stamped on the
material substance of the object could only apply to those occurring during
the period t^-t^, and would only seem to be plausible during the period
ti-to if . the contactor had had the object in his possession during
that period and had worn it or constantly touched it. Events occurring
during the period /.-/.j could not by any stretch of imagination be accounted
for in that way.
All events perceived by the sensitive which occur during the period

The fact that events occurring during the period t^-t^ can be perceived
by the sensitive suggests that the function of the object may be to establish
a rapport which, once established, functions without further assistance
from the object.

period t^-to-
It is to be noted that if at t^ the contactor knows what will happen to
the object at a later mom.ent t^, then when the moment t^ arrives he will
know what is happening to the object. This has an obvious bearing on
the assumption that if a sensitive knows what is happening to an object
when there is no normal means of knowing, this involves clairvoyance.
The conclusion is not necessarily valid.
Incidentally, an often quoted case from Osty's Supernormal Faculties in
Man (p. 104) in which Mme Morel traced an old man, Etienne Lerasle,
by using his scarf as a psychometric object, does not need discarnate
agency to explain it, as is sometimes alleged. The scarf was left at home
by Lerasle when he wandered out and died, and his body could not be
found. With the aid of the scarf, Mme Morel correctly described the
place where his body lay. This is merely a case of knowledge by the
sensitive of an event occurring in the interval t^-t-^, diagram I, of which
there are many other instances. There is no reason to suppose that the
fact that the event was the death of the contactor makes any diiference.
I should now like to apply the central fact of paranormal cognition to
these psychometric cases also—I mean the fact that there is a mediating
vehicle. The scandal about all precognition is that it appears to involve
temporally retrograde causality. Now, it does seem to me that it is a help
to our minds, if we cannot abolish the scandal, at least to get it out of our
own house. This, I venture to suggest, the mediating vehicle allows us
partly to do. Let us say that when we make the statement that a case of
paranormal cognition has " occurred ", we have gone too far. All we
know is that we have become consciously aware that it has occurred. No,
even that is going too far. All we know is that we have become consciously
aware of a mediating vehicle. That vehicle has been created for, or by,
the sensitive, and the sensitive has become aware of it. This vehicle is
the mediator of paranormal cognition. We know that the vehicle has
occurred. We do not know enough to say that the paranormal cognition
itself has occurred. We do not even know that the latter is the sort of
thing that can occur. I do not think that we can even say that the para-
normal knowledge of a future event is " acquired ". Is paranormal
knowledge, as it exists in its essence, even strictly "knowledge"? I
io8 The Modus Operandi of [Part
think it is very salutary to realize that we can scarcely make any assumptions
at all about the paranormal faculty itself. All we know is that there is
sornething beyond our sensible world which supplies themes for mediating
vehicles (themselves normal psychological constructs), and that these
themes correspond with themes which manifest themselves in the normal,
physical world. These correspondences appear to be indifferent to the
distinctions between present, past and future.
I suggest that when we say that a case of paranormal cognition has
" occurred ", this may not be strictly true. What has occurred is the
mediating vehicle, which comes into existence in accordance with the
normal laws of time and causality. A theme has been supplied to the
constructor of this vehicle, which comes from a paranormal source where
time and causality do not function in the normal way. This theme is often
of a nature such that it could not have been supplied by normal sense-
perception or by rational inference from it. How the information comes
to be obtainable from the paranormal source we do not know ; and I think
that it would be going beyond our knowledge to say that an act of para-
normal perception has occurred, or that any paranormal process has
occurred. We are certainly going far beyond the evidence when we
postulate a faculty of mind-reading, which taps conscious thoughts ; and
another faculty of clairvoyance, which perceives objects in the physical
world. These ideas are suggested by experiments of the card-guessing
order, which, taken alone, are delusive. The evidence shows clearly that
paranormal cognition is not an extra sense, or a plurality of extra senses,
which operate in the physical world. The faculty itself lies outside the
physical world, as we know it ; and that is why its disregard of causality
is less of a scandal than it would be if it occurred in the world of causality
and physical time. But I do not pretend that the scandal is banished.
There still remains the question of how events in the physical world can be
'
foretold. We still have to face the possibility that our whole idea of
duration and becoming may be wrong.
Personally, I deprecate the habit of trying to describe the paranormal
source by calling it a " universal reservoir of knowledge ". Let us frankly
admit that it is uncomprehended by us. It is perhaps incomprehensible.
" Psychometry ", and those cases in which the faculty of the sensitive
has been directed verbally instead of by the use of a physical object, may
conveniently be classed together as " rapport phenomena ". Rapport
phenomena provide an alternative explanation of evidence which seems
superficially to point to naive telepathy and naive clairvoyance. The
evidence for rapport phenomena is still of a preliminary kind. It has been
neglected by investigators, and it is urgently necessary that it should be
actively pursued. In psychometry I would suggest that the function of the
psychometric object may be to influence the construction of the mediating
vehicle. It would seem that there must be more belonging to a physical
object than appeals to the senses and more, even, than lies within the
scope of physical research. At present we have no idea what this " more "
consists of. But the subject has been greatly neglected and there is a wide
field for experiment.
Paranormal Cognition 109
Statistical Experiments
Owing to the special character of statistical experiments, and to the
tendency which has arisen to treat them in isolation from other evidence,
it is necessary to deal with them separately. The use of the term " statis-
tical experiment
'
' was justified on p. 67 above. It forms a kind of research
which has monopolised the attention of investigators in recent years. If it
were true that we could rely on the results of statistical experiments alone
as a safe guide for the interpretation of the phenomena presented by para-
normal cognition, I should be inclined to agree that we might as well
concentrate on this type of experiment and leave other evidence in abey-
ance until more progress had been made. But this is not the case. One
small point first needs to be cleared up. " Experiment " is frequently used
to mean " statistical experiment " only, other types of experiment being
classed as " spontaneous ". This use of the word " experiment " is
confusing, and in this paper I have called any deliberate attempt to produce
paranormal cognition an " experiment ".
The plan of devising experiments to be completely under the investi-
gator's control, which can be repeated at will, and in which the results
can be dealt with mathematically is, of course, perfectly sound so long as
these desiderata can be obtained without cramping the experiment to a
point which renders its conclusions misleading. Even if the results of
such experiments used in isolation are misleading where they concern
the 7iature of paranormal cognition, they are not untrustworthy when they
demonstrate its occurrence ; and I urge that these experiments should be
continued as repetitive proofs that paranormal cognition occurs.
In order to show clearly how statistical experiments, when used alone,
tend to mislead, it will be necessary to deal with a salient example
at considerable length. I will cite two articles published by Professor
J. B. Rhine. One is the article entitled Telepathy and Clairvoyance
Reconsidered in the Journal of Parapsychology for September, 1945 ;
the other is the article entitled Precognition Reconsidered, published
in the Journal of Parapsychology for December, 1945. An abstract of the
former article was printed in Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. xlviii, together with
comments by Mr W. Whately Carington, Dr J. Hettinger, Dr R. H.
Thouless, Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell, Prof. C. D. Broad and Mr Denys Parsons.
In the Abstract at the head of this article. Prof. Rhine says :
" E.S.P. is
generally considered to consist of telepathy and clairvoyance, either of
which may be precognitive. E.S.P. and precognition are regarded as
established faculties. But it is submitted here that we have no clear proof
that a truly telepathic form of E.S.P. ever occurs. It is even hard to
design a sure test for telepathy. Precognitive clairvoyance can account for
all the '
evidence '
on record for telepathy." Again, at the end of the
article, on p. 192, he says :
" But the situation must be frankly faced :
there is at the moment no adequately rehable case for telepathy."
These statements are quite unqualified and general, and there is no
reason to suppose that Prof. Rhine intends them to apply to the evidence
of statistical experiments alone. Indeed, there would be very little point
in suggesting a hypothesis which was intended to apply to a part only of
no TAe Modus Operandi 0/ [Part
the evidence, since it might be contradicted by the other part. That the
statements are intended to apply to all the evidence generally is confirmed
by a passage (the only one) in which Prof. Rhine refers to non-statistical
evidence. On p. 180 he says :
" In the light of the present reshuffle of
values, there is a temptation to turn for evidence of telepathy to the reports
of spontaneous fi3rapsychical experiences—for example, instances of
similar dreams. But this evidence could hardly be conclusive, since the
experience is necessarily objectified in the telling and precognitive clair-
voyance is probably a possibility in all such cases." But he does not
attempt to justify this conclusion by examining either spontaneous or
non-statistical experimental cases.
'
Let us examine Prof. Rhine's statement that " precognitive clairvoyance
can account for all the '
evidence '
on record for telepathy ". At the same
time we may examine the alleged evidence for clairvoyance without
precognition ; for on p. 177 of his article, Telepathy and Clairvoyance
Reconsidered, he says : "... the experimental evidence of clairvoyance is
better and more extensive by present standards and viewpoints than is
that for telepathy."
To deal first with non-precognitive clairvoyance, can it explain the
evidence for ostensible telepathy? We have already considered, in Case 13
above, an example of spontaneous, ostensible telepathy ; and on pp. 79-80
we examined the view that it might be due to clairvoyance. The
conclusion reached was that cases of spontaneous, ostensible tele-
pathy cannot be explained by clairvoyance because there is nothing
to guide the supposed clairvoyant faculty to the particular target.
Telepathy would have to be invoked to direct the clairvoyant faculty.
This has escaped Prof. Rhine's notice because he goes on the prin-
ciple of refusing to take spontaneous evidence into account. Here,
then, is one class of evidence which is ostensibly telepathic and cannot be
explained by clairvoyance.
Can clairvoyance explain experimental, ostensible telepathy.? Case 12,
quoted above on pp. 74-75, was an extract from an example of experi-
mental telepathy. How does Prof. Rhine suggest that it is to be explained
by clairvoyance? There are two records, one made by the agent and the
other by the percipient. Since the percipient must have arrived at the
facts before he recorded them, he cannot have obtained his information
by clairvoyantly reading his own record ; for we are now considering non-
precognitive clairvoyance. He must have clairvoyantly read the agent's
record, then. Here we are faced with a difficulty. We are not sure that
the agent's record was made before the percipient received his information.
We are only told that agent and percipient sat at the same time. We will,
however, suppose that the agent's record was made before the percipient
received his impressions, and that the latter clairvoyantly read this record.
But then we have to explain the fact that there is a good deal of veridical
information in the percipient's record which was not in the agent's. The
percipient cannot have read it in the agent's record because it was not
there. What does Prof. Rhine suggest? We might suppose, perhaps, that
the information about the house was in the agent's mind before the experi-
ment and that she had objectified her thoughts by speaking about them
then, and that the agent clairvoyantly heard the sound of her voice before
173] Paranormal Cognition III
the experiment began. But this involves us in the difficuky that clair-
voyance has to be provided with a delay-action, and we saw when dis-
cussing Case 1 6 (pp. 82-83) that this involves the abandonment of the
hypothesis of clairvoyance as it is at present defined, that is to say of what
we have called " naive clairvoyance ".
And there is another difficulty. If the percipient got his information by
reading the agent's record clairvoyantly, why did not this supposed per-
ceptual faculty bring the image or the sound of the actual words to the
percipient's mind.'' Why did it transcribe what it found written down into
different words? It is surely a curious thing for a faculty of perception to
do. When we listen to a lecture, our auditory faculty does not paraphrase
the lecturer's words and give us the sense in different verbal clothing.
We should be very surprised if it did ; and I doubt if we should call
hearing a faculty of sense-perception.
Clairvoyance, then, cannot give a plausible explanation of even a simple
example of experimental telepathy, in spite of the fact that in experimental
telepathy the percipient knows where and when the experiment is being
carried out, and might be supposed to have the power of directing his
clairvoyant faculty to the target, which 'he cannot do in spontaneous cases.
No doubt special cases might be found in which the clairvoyant explanation
could be made to seem a little more plausible. But on the whole it is
extremely unplausible, and we have to ask why Prof. Rhine is so certain
about the power of clairvoyance to explain ostensible telepathy. Why is he
so certain that there is any valid evidence for naive clairvoyance at all?
It is obviously because he is only thinking of card-guessing and similar
experiments. There the explanation does seem plausible. A card has
been shuffled into a pack so that no one knows where it is ;
yet the per-
cipient correctly guesses it. What more natural than to suggest that he
clairvoyantly perceives it? The pitfall has been set by the experimenter
himself when he chose card-guessing as a suitable instance of the working
of the paranormal cognitive faculty. He chose it because he could control
card-events conveniently and because with them he could deal statistically
with chance. But the fact is that the card-event has not enough qualitative
content to show what is going on. There is no verbal record to indicate
from where the information comes or does not come : it does not even
show the fundamental fact that paranormal cognition is mediated to the
percipient's consciousness by means of a constructed vehicle. (Mr
Whately Carington's simple pictures were better than cards, counters or
electric lights as events to study, because enough spontaneity and freedom
was allowed to enable the mediating vehicle to show itself. Sometimes
the percipient's drawing approached the form of the target-picture, and
sometimes the significance. But unfortunately Mr Carington gave very
little attention to this aspect of his experiments ; and in any case the
amount of freedom, though greater than in card-guessing experiments,
was not great enough.)
Let us now consider precognitive clairvoyance, which Prof. Rhine says
can account for all the " evidence " on record for telepathy. What does
he mean by " precognitive clairvoyance "? Clairvoyance is defined as a
faculty by means of which physical objects and events can be paranormally
perceived. By precognitive clairvoyance it is presumably suggested that
112 The Modus Operandi of [Part
physical objects and events can be paranormally perceived in the future.
But clairvoyance, we have seen, is no longer clairvoyance if we have to
assume that it works in the past. How can it be clairvoyance if it works in
the future.-* We deny the definition we have given to clairvoyance if we
make it either retrocognitive or precognitive.
But if we somehow muddle past this difficulty and admit for the sake of
argument that there can be such a thing as precognitive clairvoyance, will
it even then explain ostensible telepathy.' Consider a case of spontaneous
ostensible telepathy, such as Case 13 above or any other. The difficulty
which rules out non-precognitive clairvoyance as an explanation also rules
out precognitive clairvoyance. The percipient does not know that there is
any particular target to which his alleged clairvoyant faculty should be
directed and therefore cannot direct it to one physical object rather than to
another. The fact that this time the target is in the future makes no
difference. We may suppose if we like that the percipient is particularly
interested in future records of paranormal experiments. But he is also
interested in other future records, papers, books and objects of all kinds.
It is not plausible to suggest that the clairvoyant faculty can pick out the
right paper without some guidance ; and its owner has not the knowledge
to guide it, unless we postulate telepathy. And if this faculty was nosing
round among future physical objects, it would certainly light on many
others besides the particular one in question, and we should have many
instances of precognitive clairvoyance which had nothing to do with
ostensible telepathy ; but these we do not get. Precognitive clairvoyance,
even if we could plausibly postulate such a thing, is just as incapable of
explaining spontaneous, ostensible telepathy as is non-precognitive
clairvoyance.
Can it explain experimental cases of ostensible telepathy.? Here the
percipient knows that an experiment is in progress and might be supposed
to direct his faculty to the right target. But let us look at a piece of concrete
evidence. Any experiment would do which has a verbal record running to
some length.
26. Here is a portion of the record of a book-test. The case is recorded
in Journal xxvii, 60. The book-test was carried out with Mrs Leonard,
the sitter was the Rev. W. S. Irving, and the recorder Mr Theodore
Besterman. One item from the record will be sufficient. Mr Besterman's
record reads as follows :
[Feda] [i] Dora says I have to ask you a question here because of that
little problem of not being sure, not being sure, as to what is present or
immediately past or immediately future. I want to know have you
been doing anything with red books [book Th. B.] thinking of books
[book, Th. B.] with rather particularly vivid shade of red on the cover or
covers? You need not answer particularly (I don't know) but she had to
tell you that. It was in the form of a question in case you remembered
having seen one, after. Let him write it! [Repeated six times]. Wait
a minute Dora! " Well," she says, " I have an impression of a red book.
I see you looking at it."
We need not trouble about the result of the book-test as a whole. It was,
in fact, an interesting and successful one. Nor need we trouble about the
1 73] Paranormal Cognition 113
question of whether a discarnate personality had anything to do with it.
Nor, again^are we now concerned with the question of whether it may
have been due to non-precognitive clairvoyance. Perhaps this latter
explanation seems a little more plausible in cases of this kind than it does
in cases of spontaneous and experimental telepathy. We are only con-
cerned with the explanation of precognitive clairvoyance. According to
this, Feda (or Mrs Leonard if preferred) read precognitively the verbal
record which Mr Besterman was about to make and reproduced it by
word of mouth. That is to say Feda read, clairvoyantly and precognitively,
with complete verbal accuracy, and then pronounced, every word that
Mr Besterman was about to write down at her dictation. Since the case is
an experiment, there is no difficulty about the direction of the clairvoyant
faculty. Feda (or Mrs Leonard) knew that a book-test was being tried,
and would, it might be supposed, direct the precognitive clairvoyant
faculty to the right target. The difficulty now is that the hypothesis
obliges us to accept precognition which is absolutely accurate and word-
perfect. There is a good deal of evidence for precognition, but none that I
am aware of for precognition that is completely accurate. On the con-
trary, in every case of veridical precognition that I am acquainted with,
the facts as given are inaccurate and incomplete. Feda's way of getting
out her facts is particularly like that. She beats about the bush. One
can see it here in her description of the red book. She describes the
" Bell ", the publisher's mark on the spine of the book, in a way which
leaves no doubt about what she means ; but it is the usual ragged and
rather wandering description. But now Prof. Rhine asks us to believe
that Feda suddenly abandons her habitual woolliness and reads a future
document with rigid accuracy, word for word as it is going to be written.
But what about the words in square brackets? On two occasions, Mr
Irving thinks that Feda says " books ", while Mr Besterman thinks she
says " book ", and inserts " book " with his initials in square brackets.
Since Feda is assumed to have been reading the record with dead accuracy,
we must suppose that when she came to the square brackets, she ceased
reading verbally and chose one of the words to pronounce. Why did she
do this? Why did she not go on reading and say :
" Books, square
brackets, book Th. B."?
Again, Feda pronounced the words, " Let him write it! " six times over.
But that was not what she found in the text. She found in the text, " Let
him write it, square brackets, repeated six times." Why did she not say it
as written?
There is surely no need to insist that the hypothesis of a verbally
accurate reading of a future record, which obligingly ignores insertions,
and goes back to its usual wooliness and inaccuracy when the test is over,
is fantastically absurd. Yet wherever there is a verbal record of an experi-
ment, the precognitive-clairvoyant hypothesis presupposes this sudden
verbal accuracy. Why is Prof. Rhine so confident that this absurd hypo-
thesis can account for all the experimental evidence for ostensible tele-
pathy? Clearly because he has waved all the evidence aside except that
derived from statistical experiments. And why does the hypothesis appear
plausible in the case of statistical experiments? Because card-guessing,
or whatever other event has been chosen in order that it shall be amenable
H
114 Modus Operandi o/ [Part
to statistical treatment, is so restricted and devoid of content that it does
not show the absurdity of the hypothesis. There is not enough quahtative
content in a card-event to give a record which can be studied. All that
can be derived from a probability-figure is a judgment as to whether or not
chance can reasonably be held to account for the result. There is nothing
to give any information about the nature of paranormal cognition. To
speculate about the nature of paranormal cognition on the basis of statis-
tical experiments alone is to make certain that you will be snared by delusive
hypotheses. It is a pure illusion to suppose that statistical experiments are
" safe "if used alone as an instrument of research into the nature of para-
normal cognition. They are safe only as far as the probability-figure-
indicates that the number of successful guesses cannot reasonably be
attributed to chance.
Thus naive clairvoyance, whether assumed to be precognitive or not,
cannot account for the evidence for telepathy, spontaneous or experi-
mental. It has the delusive appearance of accounting for it in statistical
experiments only.
I will now make another quotation from Prof. Rhine's article. Telepathy
and Clairvoyance Reconsidered. On p. i8i he defines the requirements for
a test of true clairvoyance thus :
" The requirements for such a test ", he
says, " can be put very simply : If a subject significantly identifies cards
extrasensorily when the order of the cards is never known and no record of
their order is taken, then no opportunity is provided for precognitive
telepathy, and the test is one of true clairvoyance." But how can we be
sure that this proves clairvoyance.? On p. 107 we saw that psychometry, or
more generally that " rapport phenomena " provide a strong reason for
distrusting this statement. If the sensitive has touched the cards at a
moment t, or even, if we take the evidence as a whole, if his interest has
been directed towards the cards, there is strong reason to suspect that he
may know the situation that these cards will occupy at a future moment t^.
When the moment /i
arrives, no matter whether anyone else knows or ever
will know their situation, he will be able to say where the cards now are.
This will not involve clairvoyance ; it will only involve previously estab-
lished rapport. The two are by no means the same. The latter does not
involve the paranormal perception of physical objects, which clairvoyance
asserts, although its modus operandi may still be obscure.
It may be true that in card-guessing experiments the subject is not, as a
rule, allowed to touch the cards beforehand (although in some of Prof.
Rhine's matching experiments I believe that the subjects do handle one of
the packs used). The psychometric object, the evidence suggests, is only
one way of canalising the faculty in a given direction. Verbal direction
often seems to have the same effect. Apparently anything which centres
the subject's interest on the object will do.
Perhaps it may be argued that it is only a special type of sensitive who is
open to these " rapport " effects. It does seem to be true that the most
successful sensitives of this type are those who drop into a kind of light
hypnosis ;
but in Prof. Rhine's experiments we have only to account for a
few sporadic successes in a very slight kind of event, and it is quite
plausible to suggest that his subjects had enough " rapport-faculty " in
them to account for these. It is a defect of the statistical method of
lyj] Paranormal Cognition * .115
research that very sHght traces of paranormal cognition are magnified and
given an appearance of undue importance. This is not a defect if one
merely wishes to prove that paranormal cognition exists ;
but it is a defect
if one wishes to study its nature. I do not see that we can rule out " rap-
port " effects as a possible explanation of the evidence which Prof. Rhine
confidently asserts to be proof of clairvoyance in card-guessing.
It is the same with the alleged evidence for clairvoyance derived from
Prof. Rhine's experiments in psycho-kinesis. He argues that some of the
strongest evidence for clairvoyance is to be found in dice-throwing
experiments. He says that dice could not be made to fall in particular
positions unless the subject were clairvoyantly aware of their positions as
they were rolling. Prof. Broad {Proc. xlviii, 22-3) has pointed to the
naivety of this assumption. I can only endorse this, and ask Prof. Rhine,
and those who treat evidence as he does, to come out of their statistical
isolation for a moment and consider the marked-chair experiment (Case 25,
p. loi above), and then to ask themselves whether they are justified in
thinking of paranormal cognition in terms of additional senses which
work in the space-time world. The marked-chair experiment, and the
other evidence I have quoted abovCj show that paranormal cognition is a
totally diff'erent thing from what statistical workers have made up their
minds that it is. Even if we had to assume that knowledge of the positions
of the dice were necessary for psycho-kinesis, a slight previously established
rapport between the subject and the dice might be sufficient to provide it
without the necessity for clairvoyance.
I suggest that there is no clear evidence for what I have called " naive
clairvoyance ", that is to say for a paranormal sense by means of which
physical objects and events can be directly perceived.
Again, in his article. Precognition Reconsidered {Journal of Parapsycho-
logy, December 1945), Prof. Rhine speaks of Pcg-T (precognitive tele-
pathy), Pcg-C (precognitive clairvoyance) and Pcg-SP (precognitive
sensory perception) as if these were separate faculties which could be
reasonably supposed to exist. To make assumptions like this, without
consuhing the whole of the relevant evidence, is, I maintain, merely to get
oneself fogged.
I do not wish it to be supposed that I am attacking Prof. Rhine or that
I am attacking statistical experiments. I am.protesting against a wholly
unscientific way of dealing with evidence. If they are not to be misled
and are not to bring psychical research into disrepute, investigators must
cease to isolate themselves in one particular type of experiment and must
deal with all the evidence impartially.
Prof. Broad, in the course of some remarks he makes on my comments on
Prof. Rhine's article {Proc. xlviii, 25) says that he is puzzled to know
whether I really think that there is any known alternative method of
discovering the laws of phenomena beside that of experiment, when by
" experiment " is understood the attempt to analyse and control conditions
and to vary them one at a time. I certainly think that that is the best
method of discovering the laws of phenomena where the method can be
applied without obscuring the phenomena. I do not advocate the aban-
donment of experiment, but only the abandonment of a particular type of
experiment which does obscure the phenomena. I do not even advocate
1 1 6 The Modus Operandi of [Part
the abandonment of that, but only that it should be regarded as an auxiliary
and be supplemented by other forms of experiment which do not obscure
the phenomena. In psychical research the phenomena we wish to investi-
gate have a spontaneity of their own, and it is only by allowing them to
retain some degree of spontaneity that we can become acquainted with
their nature. If we confine our attention to a type of paranormal event
which excludes that spontaneity, we shall be misled as to the nature of
paranormal phenomena.
Prof. Broad says :
" There is obviously nothing in the experimental
method as such which compels us to confine it to the investigation of
feeble instances of paranormal phenomena. Our trouble is that we do not
at present know how to produce at will strong and persistent instances."
Strong and persistent instances all have too much qualitative content to be
dealt with statistically ; and to control them completely would be to
eliminate their spontaneity. It is not the experimental method as such
which has to be abandoned, but the particular type of experiment which
obscures the nature of paranormal cognition. The experimental method
needs to be adapted to the nature of the subject-matter. In statistical
experiments the investigator is controlling the wrong things. He ought to
be controlling the formation of the mediating vehicle. Actually he sim-
plifies the event to such an extent, in order to control it, that the pheno-
menon he wishes to investigate has no chance to reveal itself.
On p. 21, in a paragraph entitled " Legitimate and illegitimate con-
clusions ", Prof. Broad says :
" Suppose that there is adequate evidence
for paranormal cognition in cases where telepathy is excluded. And
suppose that it should be found that, when experiments are done under
conditions where clairvoyance is excluded, there is not evidence for para-
normal cognition. Then the conclusions which could legitimately be
drawn are the following : (i) In an experimental set-up of this nature, and
with such subjects as have been used in the experiment, the presence of
clairvoyant conditions is hotli necessary and sufficient to ensure a detectable
amount of paranormal cognition." This is the first conclusion, which I
am alone concerned with. It seems to me to be sound only if we confine
ourselves to the results of statistical experiments. Suppose that there is
evidence that paranormal cognition occurs when the conditions for clair-
voyance are presfent and the conditions for telepathy absent. Can we be
sure that pre-established rapport does not account for the results? In
that case, the conditions for clairvoyance, though present, would be neither
necessary nor sufficient to produce the result. What right have we to
ignore the possibility of pre-established rapport? The only reason, so
far as I can see, which could be given, is that evidence for it is not produced
by the kind of experiment which some of us prefer. It may be that the
evidence for psychometric rapport is not at present very strong. That is
our fault for having neglected the subject. But that could not be given as
a reason for refusing to examine and increase it. I maintain that it is not
safe to draw conclusions about the nature of paranormal cognition from
the results of statistical experiments alone.
173]
Paranormal Cognition 117
Summary of Conclusions
The main points of this paper may be summarised as follows :
(1) Paranormal cognition is not a conscious process. Its product alone is
revealed to consciousness.
(2) This product is here called a " mediating vehicle ". It is sub-
consciously created by the percipient.
(3) The mediating vehicle is not a paranormal phenomenon but is the
product of psychological machinery which all possess. It may take the
form of a sensory hallucination or of an impulse or of automatic verbaliza-
tion or of a dream.
(4) The same vehicle which mediates paranormal cognition also
mediates subconscious expectations and beliefs or normally acquired
knowledge which has not reached consciousness independently. In these
latter cases, neither the vehicle nor the material is paranormal.
(5) Something which may be broadly called a subconscious motive
underlies the formation of mediating vehicles in normal and paranormal
cases alike.
(6) Telepathy does not consist in the transmission of the agent's
conscious thought to the percipient. This supposed " thought-trans-
ference " is here called " naive telepathy ".^
(7) The subliminal awareness, which forms the core of paranormal
cognition in cases of apparent telepathy, is not an awareness of the details
which appear in the mediating vehicle but is more nearly akin to awareness
of a proposition.
(8) It was suggested that the evidence points to the view that paranormal
cognition, in its essence, may not be an occurrence. It may be the mediating
vehicle only which occurs.
(9) The evidence for " travelling clairvoyance " and " psychometry
"
shows that distant mental and physical events, unknown to the percipient,
can be described by certain types of subject who {a) are verbally directed
to the scene or {b) hold objects which have been touched by actors in the
scene. These have been called jointly " rapport phenomena ".
(10) There is evidence to show {a) that some sensitives can know future
events which will happen to the psychometric objects they touch, and
{b) that some can know future events which will happen to persons to
whom their attention is verbally directed.
(11) Taken together, {a) and [b) in (10) suggest a possible alternative
explanation for evidence which apparently points to clairvoyance.
(12) The hypothesis of clairvoyance, understood as the paranormal
perception of physical events and objects (here called " naive clair-
voyance "), whether combined with precognition or not, cannot reasonably
explain spontaneous, ostensible telepathy, because in spontaneous cases
the subject has no knowledge of the event in question and cannot therefore
direct the supposed clairvoyant faculty to the appropriate target.
With regard to experimental telepathy, non-precognitive clair^^oyance
is highly unplausible as an explanation because the percipient often
manifests veridical cognition of which there is no contemporary, physical
1 The agent's role is probably directive rather than transmissive.
ii8 T/je Modus Operandi o/ [Part
counterpart. Precognitive clairvoyance is still more unplausible because
it involves the hypothesis that precognition becomes, on occasion, suddenly
completely word-perfect and accurate.
A further and general objection to naive clairvoyance is that the physical
object or event which forms its subject-matter is often not contemporary
with the subject's experience. Naive clairvoyance, then, has to be com-
bined with retrocognition or precognition, and in either case ceases to be a
faculty of sense-perception, which it is defined as being.
(13) Statistical experiments, which appear, if regarded in isolation, to
point to the existence of naive telepathy and naive clairvoyance, are mis-
leading because the events they employ are too restricted to reveal the true
nature of paranormal cognition, and in particular the fact that it is mediated
to consciousness.
(14) The attempt at present being made to carry out statistical research
in isolation from every other kind of research is in the highest degree
unscientific, misleading and dangerous. All evidence bearing on para-
normal cognition should be treated impartially. Experiments should be
planned and hypotheses formed in the light of all relevant evidence.
Two Questions
My plea that it is useless to restrict research in paranormal cognition to
less informative events, because these events enable us to exercise the
particular kind of control we wish to exercise, and to deal statistically with
chance, is likely to be met by two questions. I shall probably be asked :
(i) Can we afford to relinquish our control of the experimental conditions,
and (2) can we afford to dispense with the mathematical evaluation of
chance?
The main answer to both questions is simple. We must do so if we
wish to make any genuine progress in understanding paranormal cognition.
With regard to the first question, we are not asked to relinquish all control
of the conditions. If the right subject be employed, he is amenable to
verbal direction and responsive to question and answer ; and this provides
sufficient control for practical purposes. With regard to the second
objection, it is the qualitative poverty of the statistical type of event which
renders the statistical evaluation of chance necessary. Given experi-
mental results by a good subject, they are as a rule sufficiently rich in
qualitative, veridical items to rule out chance as a reasonable hypothesis,
unless the proposition be deliberately held that a great deal more can be
put down to chance when it occurs in connection with the paranormal
than can be put down to it in connection with any other subject. This
proposition was dealt with in an address which I delivered to this Society
in June, 1945.
Surely no one would insist on experimenting with events which give
rise to misleading theoretical conclusions because they enable him to
deal with chance statistically!
173] Paranormal Cognition 119
A Suggested Programme for Experiment
(1) The first essential in research is that the evidence should be treated
impartially. It is useless to confine our attention to a particular type of
experiment, whose method appeals to us, and to ignore all phenomena
which cannot be dealt with by its means.
(2) Research should not be broken up or isolated. Experiments
should be planned in the light of past experience and should not start
de novo. Every experiment should be framed to answer a particular
question suggested by past evidence.
(3) The pioneer work in paranormal cognition referred to above (which
is admittedly sketchy) should be vigorously followed up. It shows that
what is actually observed is a vehicle constructed within the subject's
personality to mediate paranormal knowledge to consciousness. The
study of this vehicle should be the main task of investigators.
(4) Definite experiments are needed to confirm and carry further
the pioneer work in " travelling clairvoyance " and " psychometry ".
The study of errors should be helpful here, and the investigator would
find ch. V. in Part iv of Osty's Supernormal Faculties in Man instructive.
(5) Experiments should be devised to throw light on the indirectness
and symbolism introduced into the mediation of paranormal cognition.
These would probably establish the fact there is no such thing as naive
clairvoyance, or direct paranormal perception of the physical world. For
example, a subject might be asked to describe the interior of a room un-
known to him. Then a person might be introduced into the room who
would carry on a conversation with himself in dialogue. It would then be
seen whether the subject described the physical fact (one person talking to
himself) or the suggested physical fact (two people having a conversation).
Details of experiment, however, would soon suggest themselves.
(6) The whole question of "psychometry" as well as of "verbal
rapport " needs to be experimentally investigated. Osty's conclusions on
pp. 13 1-2 of Supernormal Faculties of Man, need to be verified. The
" Gold Pencil-Case " and " Marked Chair " experiments (Cases 24 and 25
above), which indicate that a sensitive subject, by touching an object,
can know its future history, should in particular be verified.
(7) The right type of sensitive for this experimental work appears to be
one who easily enters a light state of hypnosis. Such sensitiveness should
be sought diligently and selected with care.
(8) Experiments are needed to reveal as much as possible of the nature
of the paranormal source behind the mediating vehicle. This will
probably be difficult. I suggest that what is needed here is synthesis
rather than analysis, and that information from various sources should be
brought to converge on the problem. The paranormal source, as it
reveals itself in mediumship, in automatic writing, in artistic inspiration,
and in mystical experience should be studied, since the problem is to
grasp the size of this source and to get it into something like a right
perspective. Restricted laboratory experiments are of no use alone.
(9) Statistical experiments have their value, but as a method of inquiry
into the nature of paranormal cognition, this is very limited. They can
I20 The Modus Operandi of Paranormal Cognition Abstract [Part 173]
detect small traces of paranormal cognition and can give innumerable
demonstrations of its occurrence. Since this appears to make a great
impression on the scientific mind, it is desirable to go on repeating these
experiments and advertising them in scientific circles.
This paper may appear to some in the light of an attack on research.
It is far from being that : it is intended to be a stimulus to research of a
more constructive kind, while at the same time it is an endeavour to correct
an unbalanced and unscientific method of dealing with evidence.
My thanks are due to Professor H. H. Price for kindly helping me to
give clearer expression to certain philosophical points which arose in the
course of this paper.

Previous Evidence from Trance which is not Explicable
BY Telepathy from the Sitters
Much has been written about the mediumship of Mrs Osborne Leonard.
The Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research contain many
articles on her sittings and, in addition to the evidence of identity which
Communicators have given, record successive types of evidence which
were apparently devised and carried through by the Communicators
themselves and not first suggested by sitters.
Of these we find :
Book Tests. See S.P.R. Proceedings for April 1921, pp. 241-400, and
Journal ior December 1936, pp. 304-307.
Tests from the public press given previous to publication. See Journal
for May 1921, pp. 89-107, and February 1925, pp. 18-23.
Proxy Sittings. See Proceedings for May 1933, pp. 139-185 ;
Proceedings
for December 1935, pp. 439-519.
And finally. Proxy sittings so arranged by an intermediary that the sitter
had no contact with the persons desiring messages from deceased friends.
See Proceedings for July 1939, pp. 257-306.
Study of the above shows that telepathy from sitters can no longer be
held to explain the results obtained.
122 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
Other suggestions have been put forward in the endeavour to provide
an alternative to the idea that purported Communicators are actually
present at the sittings and giving the information which comes from the
medium's lips. These suggestions include telepathic action of an almost
unlimited character, whereby the information is supposed to be derived
from any person, however unknown and distant, who might at any time
have possessed the information ; while other suggestions go to the
extreme of positing universal consciousness, or unlimited community of
mind, or a pooled memory of the human race from which the medium
selects appropriate items!
The hypothesis we now put forward, together with an outline of the
facts on which it is based, substitutes for these vague suggestions a claim
for the accuracy of that which has been consistently stated by the Com-
municators ;
namely, that the messages are given by discarnate persons
who come to the sitting for this purpose. It also supports the assertion
of Communicators that they still have bodies—bodies of substance—
although not formed of earthly matter.
These statements are stoutly supported by Feda, Mrs Leonard's
Control, who, for the greater part of the sitting, voices through the
medium's lips what Communicators wish to say.
Here I should remark that the question of Feda's personality does not
come into this paper. Whether she is an individual entirely distinct from
the medium, or combined with the medium, or only an aspect of the
medium's mentality—none of these questions need detain us. Let it
suffice that when the name appears in this article it indicates the " Con-
trol " who speaks through Mrs Leonard's lips. Not that the question is
unimportant, but simply that it is irrelevant to the hypothesis about to be
set forth. Personally I believe Feda to be a distinct individual, usually
resident in the Beyond, but allotting some of her time to work on earth.
In that aspect of her personality which one sees during her control I am
more familiar with her character, idiosyncrasies and habits of thought
than I am with those of the majority of my acquaintances on earth ; but
then I have listened to her at fairly frequent intervals during the last
twenty-eight years!
The Hypothesis now offered is based on New Evidence
RELATING TO DiRECT-VoiCE WhISPERS
It may be convenient if the hypothesis is at once stated in brief outline,
so that readers can appreciate more easily the links of evidence on which
it is based.
It is as follows : the Communicator comes to the sitting in that body
which is now normally his in the Etherial Realms. He takes up the posi-
tion, some two or three feet in front of the medium, which Feda finds
most convenient for her reception of the messages. He speaks his message
in words during those periods of the sitting which favour this method of
communication, while for other periods it seems more eiTective to give it
by telepathy. The difference between these periods in a sitting is caused
by variations in the output of an emanation which flows from the medium,
with possible additions from sitter and note-taker. This emanation is
173] ^ New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 123
termed by Feda " The Power " ; it varies in density from moment to
moment, and its gradual exhaustion brings progressive difficulty in com-
munication and finally stops it altogether. During the sitting both medium
and sitter are within this field of psychic energy, which, although but
rarely luminous itself, yet renders visible to Feda any object or person,
incarnate or discarnate, who is also within its limited range. Hence
Feda's ability to describe the personal appearance of Communicators.
I have reserved until last that quality of the emanation or psychic
energy which is most important for my hypothesis, namely that it carries
to Feda the spoken words which she hears more or less plainly, although
the sitter usually hears nothing whatever save what comes from the
medium's lips. I say " usually " because of the exception which will be
described hereafter at some length. This is an occasional utterance of
a word, or words, in a clear and distinct whisper, akin to what one is
accustomed to hear from Communicators at Direct Voice (or " Trumpet ")
sittings with what are termed physical mediums.
How is it that, \^hile the greater part of the message is unheard by the
sitter, he is able to hear these occasional spoken whispers.' I believe that
the explanation will be found in the action of the before-mentioned
emanation. This emanation seems to be a substance having relations with
physical matter and also with the etherial substance of the next stage of
existence. It is sufficiently akin to the latter for use by the discarnate
Communicator, and it is sufficiently akin to earth to affect the air of the
seance room, not at all times, but when moved more violently than it is
by the usual speaking of the Communicator. When the latter speaks with
special vigour the vibrations of the emanation set up secondary vibra-
tions in air, and it is these secondary vibrations which the sitter hears as a
clear whisper.
Examples of the Direct-Voice Whisper
Before giving a more detailed analysis of these whispered words it may
be well to offer some examples. I quote the few preceding words, then
the Direct Voice whisper, and add Feda's reaction to it.
Feda : Part of it may happen earlier, but he feels—What? The fill
—
What?
D. V. : Fulfilment.
Feda : The actual fulfilment of the prophecy, etc.
Feda : That is when we usually av— av
—
D. V. : Avail
Feda : Avail ourselves of etc.
Feda : Here there is an inner urge towards meeting opportunities more
than half-way ;
possibly it is due to—What?
D. V. : Awareness.
Feda : Awareness of the existence of all these opportunities.
Feda: This touches on another aspect of our—Our what? Our work?
D. V. : Our group work.
Feda : You cannot have sustained
—
124 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
D. V. : Communication.
Feda : Communication with us, without, etc.
Feda : Sometimes we have a— "
'
" .
D. V. : Company.
Feda : a company present, etc.
•
Feda : (Following an explanation came the remark—
)
D. V. : You see, Charlie.
Feda : You do see, Charlie, etc.
(A new line of thought was commenced with the words—
)
D. V. : Of course some individuals
Feda : Of course some individuals obtain, etc.
Very frequently the D. V. speaks the one word, " Yes ", as in the following :
C. D. T. : I have already done that.
D. V. : Yes.
My Communicators rarely speak more than six or seven words in this
direct voice at one time, but my friends, Mr and Mrs Conan Shaw,
received the following unusually long sentences, the Communicator being
an old Clergyman.
Sitters asked a question which was answered thus :
D. V. : / thought it was my duty—custom, perhaps.
Sitter : But there must be essence of good in it?
D. V. : / should not have stuck to it if it had ?iot been. It mav be it is
'':
paving the way to a universal knowledge of God, beyond the outside brick
walls or institutions.
The unusual length of the above, coupled with the fact that Mr and Mrs
Conan Shaw have had some initial success in their home sittings, where
they seek to develop for the direct voice, suggest that they contribute to
the circle of emanation much more than do other of Mrs Leonard's
sitters.
Evidence for the Reality of a Mediumistic Emanation
When the late Dr Osty was studying Rudi Schneider in Paris he became
convinced that Rudi could, at times, produce something which, although
invisible and intangible, obscured infra-red rays.
A group of investigators, wishing to verify this, invited Rudi to London
for a series of experiments at the rooms of the Society for Psychical
Research. Their findings are recorded in the Proceedings for June 1933,
from which the following quotations are taken :
p. 274. On nearly every occasion many movements of the galvanometer
coil were recorded. . . . These movements of the galvanometer coil,
which confirm Osty's discovery, are very remarkable. ... In addition,
the bell in series with a selenium cell rang on two or three occasions,
indicating an absorption of at least 50% of the infra'-red radiation!
Whatever it is that affects the galvanometer, or bell circuits, appears to
emanate from Rudi, since the ray absorption sometimes synchronised
with his breathing and sometimes took place immediately after he said it
would.
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 125
p. 275. The many records of large movements definitely indicate a
I
considerable variation of the current in the galvanometer which cannot
'
be due to any disturbance other than the absorption of the infra-red
radiation. In view of the distance of the medium from the apparatus and
1
the fact that he was always under vigilant control, it would appear that this
'
absorption is due to some agency at present unknown, emanating from
Rudi himself.
p. 277. " Rudi-OIga ", while controlled by Dr Fraser-Harris, was
moving various objects, including the curtains of the cabinet. I then
heard a loud bump, which sounded as if the table in front of the cabinet
had been overturned. At the same instant the room was illuminated by
the lamp which was the source of the infra-red beam. (It was afterwards
discovered that the table had in fact been turned upside down, and in so
doing had jerked a thread which was attached to the support block of the
infra-red projector, causing the filter to fall off). After an interval which I
find difficult to estimate—but I should say it was of the order of one
second—I heard another crash almost immediately in front of me. I at
once rose from my seat, and found Rudi quite limply on his side on the
floor, and breathing very gently, slowly and regularly. After covering
him with some dark material which I was given, I assisted in lifting him
back to his chair. During the whole of this period he made no movement
of any kind, and appeared to be completely unconscious.
This incident relating to Rudi's fall when exposed to sudden light bears
out what has been recorded by many investigators about the shock effect
of sudden light- falling upon a medium in a dark sitting. It brings to
mind an observation of my own which was due to an unusual accident.
I had brought my friend, Dr Dyson, to a sitting for direct voice where we
joined a circle of some ten other people. It was a summer evening and
there had been some difficulty in blocking the glass panels of the door to
exclude the evening light. The window was more easily blacked out, and
the sitting proceeded for a time in the usual manner. The child Control
spoke easily and frequently, not using the trumpet which served as a
megaphone for the Communicators. The medium had on this occasion
chosen me to sit next to her and to hold her left hand, while another
sitter held the right hand. At one time we heard two voices speaking
simultaneously. Many voices spoke to the various sitters. Presently I
heard a voice speaking to Dr Dyson, who was sitting opposite me in a
direct line with the door. My face was turned in this direction while I
listened to his conversation with the voice. Suddenly a flood of light
shone through the glass panels of the door where they were imperfectly
covered by the drapery we had hung over them. A cleaner had come to
sweep the passage and had switched on the lights for that purpose. This
light enabled me to see part of the trumpet distinctly ; it was suspended
in air some five feet from the floor and pointing to Dr Dyson. Then it
fell, and the voice of the Control came from low down and feebly, asking
us to sing. After the singing it said, " We had better be going " and the
sitting closed. The incident of most interest for our present consideration
is, that, at the moment when light shone into the room, I felt the medium's
hand give a sudden jerk, followed by a violent trembling which continued
until the sitting's close. Only when the light was turned on did I release
126 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
the hand, and I noticed that she snatched out a handkerchief and applied
it to her mouth. On withdrawal it was red with blood. Whatever it was
which had been drawn from her would seem to have snapped sharply
back to her mouth and throat, causing superficial damage to the tissues.
Whether this something was a dense emanation, or what is termed ecto-
plasm, it was evidently something essential to the phenomena of levitation
and of direct voice, whether the clear voice of the Control, or the loud
whispers of Communicators. Its withdrawal left no power for even the
Control to continue speaking.
A remark by my father, made eight years later, seems worth quoting
here :
J. D. T. With those mediums whose output of power has to be of a
sudden kind, a great and very sudden projection of the etheric body takes
place, not a gradual one as it is with this medium. And whatever action
took place at that moment which might be in the nature of an interruption,
anything which interfered with the requisite conditions for the production
of the phenomenon, might have very disastrous eiTect on the physical
organism of the medium, owing to the sudden indrawing of the etheric
into the aura again.
Evidence for the emanation comes from movements without contact.
For illustration of this I might refer to the Report by a Committee of the
London Dialectical Society. On p. 1 1 we find the description of movements
obtained with an ordinary dining-table around which were a number of
sitters maintaining a distance from the table of eighteen inches. On one
occasion the eleven sitters saw this table move thirteen times, and this
without contact, or possibility of contact, with anyone present. These
movements were in different directions and some of them were made as
requested by various members of the group.
Or reference might be made to Dr W. F. Crawford's experiments with
the Goligher circle, as recorded in his books. Experiments in Psychic
Science, and Reality of Psychic Phenotnena. In both these he describes
the levitation of a table without contact. The late Sir William Barrett,
F.R.S., once visited the circle to watch Crawford's work, and he informed
me that, on one occasion, he pressed forcefully upon the table in an endea-
vour to prevent its levitation, but in vain. He then sat upon the table, and
it raised him several feet from the floor. Lady Barrett, who had been
present at these experiments, told me that while Sir William was levitated
with the table she was feeling with her umbrella underneath the table legs
and satisfied herself that no cords or implements of any kind were being
used. All was clear ; the umbrella met with no obstructions.
I was first personally impressed by the reality of an emanation when
having a table sitting with Mrs Leonard. My wife and Mrs Leonard
placed their hands lightly on the bamboo table while I took down the
letters as they were spelled out by tilts. Then my wife and I exchanged
places. Messages of an evidential character were thus produced; When
Mrs Leonard suggested that my wife and I should sit at the table we did so,
but no movements followed. Mrs Leonard then placed her fingers
lightly upon the exact centre of the table, where it would have been
difficult, or probably impossible, for her to move it by pressure. The
result was immediate ; for the tilts commenced and continued until the
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 127
medium gradually withdrew her hand. As she did so, the table slowed
down and quickly ceased all movement. Again the medium's hand was
placed on it as before and again the movements continued. It was a clear
demonstration that something essential to the table movement proceeded
from Mrs Leonard and that neither my wife nor I could produce this
mysterious something. When, some years later, an occasional word or two
in the direct voice began to sound in my sittings, my attention was drawn
to this mysterious something, and I proceeded to question both Control
and my Communicators about it. Their replies may be summarised as
follows : .
•
What Communicators say about the Emanation
There is a ring of power around the medium which may extend a
varying distance. It surrounds both Communicator and sitter.
It flows from the medium throughout the sitting, but fluctuates more or
less and is exhausted towards the close, so bringing the sitting to an end.
It charges the atmosphere around the medium and sitter ; the medium
produces it and the Communicator uses it. Its outer limit may be some
few feet from the medium. (When I took my brother-in-law to a sitting,
shortly after my sister's passing, she began to speak and then suddenly
ceased. It was explained to me by the Control that, as my sister moved
away to where her husband was sitting, she passed out of the circle of
power. The Control could not then hear her words.)
Experienced Communicators can feel how near to the medium their
best results are obtained. Often, in moments of excitement, they approach
too close and Feda then urges them to go further away because, when too
near, she gets a choking feeling and the medium begins to cough.
Communicators can rarely see the power ; but they feel its influence.
On one occasion, when I was questioning my father about it, Feda said,
" He keeps pacing backwards and forwards. What are you doing? He is
doing it purposely, and says, It is something which I suspected and am now
tracing. I cannot see where the power ends here, but I do feel a diff'erent
sensation when I move out of it and when I move into it again. I feel a
slight tingling, but very, very slight, as I come into it." My father has
repeatedly mentioned that his mind is not so clear after entering the circle
of power, yet only when within it can he transmit thought in words. The
Power seems to have a slightly anaesthetising effect, not by any means a
complete one, but sufficient to produce a slight numbing of his perception
and memory.
My sister once said of her condition when within the circle of power :
It is a no-man's land between the two conditions, yours and ours. . . .
It is supposed that communication concerns earth people and spirit people,
whereas there is also the peculiar bridgeway which has to be used and which
is neither one nor the other, but has some of the characteristics of each.
Medium and sitter are, in part, working in a condition which is not entirely
yours, and we work in one which is not entirely ours. It is a pooling of
resources which creates the bridge."
J. D. T. :
" Our vibrations are not operative by themselves on your
plane. When we do something on your plane (which is not our plane).
128 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
we have to make use of that in you which corresponds most nearly to ours,
but which is not ours."
Etta :
" Sending words is more difficult than sending ideas ; for the
power fluctuates like wind on windy days when you may hear a rush and it
dies down again before gathering force and blowing up once more. So the
power ebbs and flows. . . . Our trouble is that we cannot tell when it is
ebbing, and so we waste time trying to get something on when it is ebbing,
which could only be done when the power is full." She added, " I think
power is weakest at the beginning and end of a sitting ; of course weaker
at the end, but towards the middle of a sitting it is at its strongest."
(This I have been able to confirm, as will be shown on a later page.)
Before commencing my sitting in November 1924 I asked Mrs Leonard
if she knew what Feda meant when speaking of " the power ". I found
that Mrs Leonard was familiar with the term but had no theory about
it. She noticed that she was less alert in mind immediately after a sitting
and if taking her ball exercises then would miss the ball much more often
than she would do before a sitting. In earlier days she had frequently
given four sittings daily and could not suggest how the power was recovered
between them, and supposed that Feda brought them to an end before the
power was expended.
Feda presently remarked that my father had heard the conversation
before the sitting began and he would give his opinion. Among other
things he said the following :
I have vocal organs and on my own plane my voice is heard, but that of
which larynx and tongue are formed is not the same as yours. The power,
the mysterious power, helps just for a moment to clothe my larynx with
material sufficiently like yours, a kind of counterfeit of yours, so that I may
use it for communicating. But I do not use it at a distance from the
medium, I have to come very close to do it. This projection of power can
only travel a certain distance from the medium, so I have to come forward
to catch it, as it were, or draw it. This cannot be done all the time. I
never know when I shall catch sufficient from the medium to clothe or
thicken my larynx with it. This power from the medium is a very indivi-
dual part of her, and that is the reason why, in many instances, the voice
may be tinctured with a tone of the medium's voice or by some peculiarity
of hers.
(Looking back it would seem that, at this early date of my inquiry into
the nature of the power and the occasional manifestation of direct voice,
my father was groping for the explanation and supposed that his direct
voice whispers were caused by direct action on air owing to the partial
materialisation of vocal organs.)
At another early sitting I asked my father if he could see " the power ".
He replied that usually he did not see it and was only conscious of its
presence, but that there were certain conditions in which it might be seen.
He added. We feel, rather than see, the power.
My wife was with me at a sitting when we had a Communicator who,
by various evidence, proved himself to be W. L. W., an old friend of my
wife's family. He had been interested in science and had an alert mind.
Feda (speaking for W. L. W.) : This is so interesting ; here I am in this
wonderful condition and I can see you, not very clearly, but I see you are
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 129
there. Most extraordinary! You do not see me, do you? Yet it looks
darker where you are and lighter where I am, so you should see me. It
looks very misty, foggy, where you are.
What is that spark? (Feda interjects that there is no spark, and I
remark that possibly he is alluding to the lamp.)
Yes, I see you in a circle. (I suggest that it may be the circle of power.)
Your father says that is what it is. Mr W. L. W. says, I do not know
if you would call it that, or whether it is my circle of vision. I expect your
father is right, but I want to find out for myself and think it out for myself.
One thing that strikes me much is the absence of colour, not only as I see
you now, but as I saw you when I came to observe you address a meeting
recently. It seems so very dull and drab. There is more colour in the
realm where I now live. . . . My new clear vision operates on my own •
plane, but apparently needs a great deal of adjustment to enable me to see
clearly onto yours. ... At this moment I see (here Feda interjects, " It is
not smoke, but let him say what he calls it.")—I see smoke circling round
your wife. Mr John says, That is the power, the etheric power, which is
not very steady round Clara, and it looks to him to be moving about,
wafting, and yet it is steadier around Feda. Your father says, that is not
altogether due to a psychic cause, as Clara is sitting in a physical draught
just sufficient to move the outer circle of the power ; but it is interesting
that W. L. W. should notice that the power is denser near the medium
and also more luminous. It apparently has a self-luminous quality which
I had not noticed.
Then, at the next sitting :
J. D. T. : Our friend last time was wrong in likening the power to
smoke.
C. D. T. : I was surprised that he could see the power, as I had under-
stood that it was usually invisible to you.
J. D. T. : It is not always visible. Indeed he might come a hundred
times and not be able to perceive it in that way.
C. D. T. : Do you think he was mistaken about it?
J. D. T. : He was mistaken in likening it to smoke. He saw something,
say a corner of the power, which was concentrated round Clara and which
was being disturbed by a slight current of air which probably came from
the window by which she sat. It was a circumstance which might not
frequently happen.
At another time my father replied to a question as follows :
Take this sitting, for sake of concrete illustration. When I arrived here
today I came travelling through the atmosphere. On coming near, I look
at the medium and at you, and see around you a circle looking like mist.
(This would seem to hav^ been one of the rare occasions when it was
visible.) Now, I could stand outside this circle of mist and give messages
telepathlcally, as is often done. But I prefer to pass inside this circle of
mist, which is etheric power given off by you two. Then my communica-
tion commences. The dry atmosphere today enables Feda to hear my
voice-vibrations. I do not put myself into any particular mental frame,
but much depends on the conditions which I find awaiting me. The
circle of power varies both in quality and quantity ; if thick and heavy,
communication is difficult and I try several times to get my ideas through ;
I
130 C. Drayton Thomas '
[Part
but when clear, it is like telephoning over a clear line. Today I use voice,
but usually it is done telepathically and ideas are sent rather than words."
25th April, 1924. Etta controlling.
With most people the power is so embedded in the physical that it
never gets sufficiently near the surface to be used by itself.
C. D. T. : Then with this medium a certain amount is brought to the
surface?
Etta : Yes, and used by us until it is exhausted. One would then have
to wait until a quantity welled to the surface again. . . . This psychic
power is in the etheric part of the physical body, the ether separating the
atoms. All have it, but development implies patient work to bring it to
the surface.
» 14th November, 1924.
" The power is drawn from and through the etheric body of the
medium."
2oth February, 1925.
Communicators had often spoken of a psychic cord which united the
soul with the sleeping body on occasions when the former journeyed away
to some distance. At this sitting I was informed that the etheric cord,
which maintained the connection between soul and body, was the same in
sub'stance as " the power ".
6th March, 1925.
C. D. T. : Can you say how the medium's etheric body, her aura, and
the power are related ?
J. D. T. : There is a close relation, and development consists in regulat-
ing the relationship. The etheric body lies within the aura, the power
lies in both. . . . When a medium begins to develop, the etheric body is
able to detach itself and this enables the power to flow from it more
easily.
At a sitting in March 1946 I asked for more information as I was
engaged on this paper and wished to know whether my Communicators
could confirm or enlarge upon what had been said several years ago.
It was stated that they were not always sure whether or not their words
had been heard in the direct voice. In discussing the subject among
themselves they had agreed in thinking that the direct voice was
favoured when a speaker expressed himself quite naturally and without
any effort to arrange his thoughts or to express them in a particular way,
but was specially interested in the immediate topic. In short, something
spoken forcefully, but without mental effort.
It struck me that this would include exclamations, contradictions,
corrections, and supplying a word over which Feda had stumbled.
My father then joined in, saying that he had listened to our conversation
and agreed that the direct voice was most likely with " rather forceful
people who expressed themselves in a strong, vital, forceful manner and
so gave out energy ". He thought that the apathetic and lethargic Com-
municator would be at a disadvantage with it.
I then asked my father if he could tell me in what way the Communi-
cator's body differed from the etheric body of a sitter.
He replied, " I think there is a little difference ; for while you are in a
physical body some of the density or substance of your etheric body is
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 131
being absorbed by the physical body. Therefore the Communicator's
body is the stronger, for there is nothing drawing on it, or " feeding
"
upon it.
He was certain that, during earthly life, the physical drew upon the
etheric body in some way which he could not explain ; also that there
was a reverse process, since the etheric body in some way drew sustenance
from the physical body.
In short, while essentially alike, the Communicator's body was stronger
and more vital, while the etheric body of the sitter was in some degree
dependent on its physical body.
Next I asked if the Communicator's body was identical in its substance
with the power emanating from the medium. He replied that it was, but
with the difference that the power was a part of the medium's etheric
body which all the time was depending on and drawing from the physical
body of the medium. This fact would explain why the physical organism
of the medium determined in some degree the quality of the mediumship.
" When we say that the power is going, it may be that the etheric can
no longer draw what it needs from the physical. The power is a difficult
thing to define and we are trying from our side to understand it better.
We realize that both the bodily condition of the medium and her state of
mind have an effect on what we try to do in the sitting."
C. D. T. : Would it be correct to say that when you stand here in the
circle of power your body is clearly defined and isolated, but surrounded
by something etherically much the same as your body?
J. D. T. : Yes, yes, yes.
And I would add that this power comes from the medium now and
again ; one moment it seems rather stronger and at another more with-
drawn. I do not know whether it is subject to the mental effort of Feda
or the medium, but we are sometimes aware, whether from your remarks
or perhaps from our own feelings also, that we have contacted this power
directly, so making what you term the direct voice. In that case our
communications, which have been inaudible to you, are clothed and made
audible by contact with this power. It is as if something billows out
occasionally. You might liken it to this ;
you may be humming a fragment
of song and suddenly you burst forth and give out a volume of sound
which would move the air at a greater distance from you. It is something
that now and again is available at a greater distance from the medium.
The same power, you understand, but available at a greater distance.
That is what we think and I expect that, as we continue investigating, we
shall be confirmed in that belief. We are not always sure what you have
heard and what you have not heard.
We come here, of course, with the desire to speak to you and we wish
you to know all we say. Hence our desire-thought and its effect on the
power, attracts it to us all the time. I think there is something automatic
about the process. Our desires and wishes are potent ; we attract the
power by our natural desire to speak to you.
The subject was briefly touched on in S.P.R. Proc. for July 1928,
section The Power or Mediumistic Emanation, pp. 72-78 ; in reading
which there is an error to be noted on p. 73, line 25, which should have
run, " although not usually visible to Control or Communicator—".

Suggestions from the Piper Records. A Promising
Line of Research
It is convenient in this paper to use the term " Power " since it is so
named in Feda's quoted remarks, but I should prefer to call it a psychic
emanation. A study of Mrs Sidgwick's article on the Piper sittings shows
that the same thing is there termed " light ". If readers study that article
in S.P.R. Proceedings for December 1915, pp. 59 to 65 and Appendix
pp. 341 to 395, they will find numerous references which agree in substance
with what has been quoted above from Mrs Leonard's sittings.
It would seem that this, at present mysterious, substance calls for
further research. It is tempting to suggest that it will eventually be found
to play an important part in the processes of physical life, in the baffling
regions of sensation and perception, and in all forms of psychic phenomena.
It may be a substance which links the material with the immaterial and
facilitates their interaction. One may even conceive of it as consisting of
many grades, some of which interact with matter while others more easily
interact with the substance of the realms awaiting our habitation after
departure from the earthly body.
Should these guesses be but partially correct we have in this psychic
emanation a worthy object for determined and persistent investigation.
Many less promising objects have richly rewarded the investigator, and it
might well be that here is the key for which Psychology, Philosophy,
Biology and Psychical Research have long sought vainly.
Evidence that Feda hears Actual Words spoken
BY Communicators
In my earlier sittings I supposed that Feda received the thoughts of the
Communicator telepathically. It has been necessary to modify this sup-
position. There is much to convince me that the best parts of a good
sitting are independent of telepathy, as Feda is listening to messages given
in spoken words which are audible to her.
What is the evidence for this?
1. Feda's actions : She always looks directly in front of the medium
towards the place where she says the Communicator is. Her attitude is
that of one listening intently ; often she bends forward as if to catch the
words more distinctly, as when I ask a question and the medium bends
forward in a listening attitude, Feda saying, " I'll ask him what he thinks
about it."
2. Feda's remarks : She often asks for a word or sentence to be repeated,
or expressed in a different way. She complains of long or difficult words.
At times she seems not to understand what is being said although the
meaning is quite clear to me. When unable to catch the correct sound of
a proper name she will often give its first part according to its sound,
although not according to its spelHng ; as C for Sidney, " Buttons " for
a name which should have been " Butters ", and " Ash " for " Nash ".
3. My observations : Long passages are given a few words at a time,
exactly as if they were being repeated by one listening to a dictated
message ; in fact, I have long ago named this type of reception " the
173] ^ New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 133
dictation method ". In the best sittings this dictation method is used for
all the most important parts of a discourse.
Feda frequently complains that she cannot hear and asks that it may be
repeated :
" What? What did you say? I've missed a word ;
perhaps
he will say it again."
She puzzles over the pronunciation of an unfamiliar name, exactly as
one often does over the telephone.
Very impressive are the little dialogues between Feda and the Com-
municator. Feda will, at times, flatly contradict the Communicator and
at other times the Communicator contradicts Feda
!
Occasionally a Communicator uses a word which seems new to Feda ;
she will assert that there is no such word, and when I explain its meaning
she will presently use it herself, often incorrectly!
A Communicator may correct Feda's pronunciation, as when objection
was taken to Feda's way of saying interei/ing :
" Don't say that. Say
interesting "!
Frequently when Feda has mis-heard a word it is corrected by the
Communicator.
Of one Communicator Feda remarked, " He is wonderfully persistent.
He keeps on about a thing until it is cleared up, when others might have
dropped it. But he will not leave it, or let it go ; he keeps on till he makes
me say what he means. He is clever at it and that makes a great deal of
difference to me. Some are much less helpful." That final remark bears
out what I have repeatedly noticed in proxy cases—that is to say, cases
in which messages are given me by unknown persons to be passed on to
their relatives. Some were capable, others were not, and some would not
take the trouble to stop for clearing up a sentence which Feda failed to
transmit at first attempt.
A rather dignified speaker had alluded to his sister coming next year
for her spring sitting. Feda gave this as " her spring chicken ". At this
the speaker expressed displeasure saying, " Not spring chicken! I do not
want you to mix up my words. I said '
spring sitting '. I had no idea
of saying '
chicken '."
The interplay between Feda and a Communicator is quite lifelike.
In the midst of one description the speaker interrupted and said, " Get it
correctly ;
you are making it out other than I mean." He then repeated-
his description in a way which corrected in an important particular what
Feda had at first said.
4. Here are some examples of passages in my notes which strongly
suggest Feda's actual hearing of words, and which do not so readily lend
themselves to the telepathic explanation.
Words misheard by Feda :
Feda : Week after week for fears—(long pause as if the misheard
word caused a check in the flow and a faltering). Years. Week after
week for years.
Feda : I see greatly—What did you call it? Something—I've missed
something. I'm sorry. Well, he says, I see great differences.
Feda : We cannot as—as— We cannot, What? Oh, I can't get that
word. Well, say it another way, Feda, he says.
134 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
On another occasion Feda said " feel ", afterwards correcting it to
" field ", which was the required word. An evident case of mishearing :
as also when she said, " What did you say? Mind?—Remind " ; the
latter being the word desired by the Communicator.
During a talk by one well known to me in his earthly life, Feda caused
the medium to imitate his characteristic movements and ways of speaking.
This may have been a careful, or an unconscious, imitation, but it was
impressive.
5. References to laughter.
Feda : He says that this will solve many problems ... Is he
making fun? He's laughing a little . . . problems of imports and
exports.
Feda : There will always be people who will prefer—He's laughing
again, though he seems serious—to travel by usual means of transit,
rather than by—etc.
C. D. T. made a humorous remark to Communicator.
Feda : Oh, he is laughing!
Feda : In the midst of being serious he could think of something funny
and laugh about it ; not being funny all the time. He could be quite
serious and suddenly—Ha, ha, ha, ha! like that. I notice he does it now
and again. (This was very characteristic of the Communicator, whom I
had known intimately all my life.)
Intonation imitated, says Feda.
Feda : I have now got into a good habit of imitating the way their voices
go up and down, up and down.
C. D. T. : That is most valuable.
Feda : When they go up and down, up and down, I imitate them because
it might have a meaning.
C. D. T. : It has. It helps out the meaning very much.
Feda : But I can't do it unless I hear the voices. Sometimes they show
me things and sometimes they give it in thought, and then I don't hear.
(This is a clear statement of the three forms of transmission. It is in
agreement with what I have noticed in my sittings.)
6. Direct Voice incidents pointing to actual hearing by Feda.
Feda : Abstinence?
D. V. : Abstinence.
Feda: I'm getting that word abstinence. I don't know what that means,
but it means something or other special to him.
(What Communicator wished to say was evidently this :
" It's like
being put in charge of a Borstal institution ") :
Feda : It's like being put in charge of a department of boars. Pigs?
Boars in an institution?
D. V. : Borstal.
Feda : I'm not quite sure. It's something to do with boars.
Feda : There was something neglected which should have been seen to.
" Bolt," he says. Now he says to Feda, " Go on, give it to him." He says,
" Fastner, bolt." (This latter remark was given like an impulsive correc-
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 135
tion and urging. It was exactly in the Communicator's manner as dis-
tinctly remembered by me.)
Feda : Willy—What.? Who's he.? Willy somebody—I can't get his
other name. Willy—somebody is compelling you. Wait a minute.
I've mixed that up.
D. V. : It is not that at all.
'•
Feda : Willy-nilly? Is that right.' Willy-nilly you are being com-
pelled, etc., etc.
Feda ; Stuart thinks he will have more important work later, though
he doesn't know quite what it is.
D. V. : At present—
Feda : Present.' He doesn't know at present. What is it, then?
" No," he said. I don't know what it is quite. " Full stop." Full stop?
But at present I am helping with, etc., etc.
(How clearly this indicates speaker and listener. The latter had joined
the first two words of a new sentence to the end of the previous. She is
then pulled up by the speaker, who finally indicates his meaning by saying
" Full stop " and proceeds to place the misused two words at the beginning
of a fresh sentence.)
The following quotations are from my article entitled, " The Modus
Operandi of Trance-Communication according to descriptions received
through Mrs Osborne Leonard." S.P.R. Proceedings, July 1928.
p. 51. At the commencement of Mrs Leonard's trance it seems as if her
individuality changes into that of another person, namely that of Feda the
Control. Feda talks to me about my communicators who are said to be
somewhere in front of the medium. Feda (as I must now term the
medium) then begins to tell me what they say, and from time to time
bends forward in the attitude of attentive listening. She often seems
puzzled as to the communicator's meaning, and will question the invisible
presence before completing the sentence.
p. 52. It is a noteworthy fact that for a period, rarely more than twenty
minutes in any one sitting, Feda will speak as if she were receiving from
dictation. I can often at these times catch a softly whispered sentence
before hearing it repeated in the clear Feda voice. This dictation method
always reaches a high degree of accuracy, and I realize that I am receiving,
not merely the communicator's thoughts, but also the characteristic
diction.
p. 59.
" So many little identifications can be made when Feda can
hear the tone of voice, with facial expressions, lip movement, etc. So at
first we all try to speak in our accustomed way, so that little points of
identification may be given. If Feda only got things impressionally she
might miss many little points which help to convince you."
p. 61. " Your father says there are times when Feda cannot see him,
but only hears him. He wants to point out that when Feda cannot see him
but only hears him, she must have some way of locating him. Is it not,
he asks, by a light or misty substance? Quite right, when Feda cannot see
him Feda can see something like a light near the sitter or going away.
Feda has had two or three sittings with a person before seeing the com-
municator, although getting the messages by feeling or hearing."
136 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
p. 62. Feda : What? . . . Wait . . . Cannot hear you ... It is a
nuisance. I was hearing him very well just then, but there is a vib-
ration of voices coming now which mixes it all up. Can you shut
the window?
This break came in the midst of an interesting passage which flowed
with ease and accuracy. I then noticed, for the first time, a sound of
voices in conversation outside the room where we were sitting. Two
persons were talking on the lawn outside. I asked them to speak more
softly and closing the window returned to my place. Feda then said :
It does not matter while your father talks mentally, but when he speaks
in voice it does matter. Although you cannot hear his voice, it sounds
like a real voice to Feda while in the medium.
(How clearly this distinguishes between the two methods of giving the
messages!) I
p. 69. " Feda can hear part, and part not, is able to hear some of it
today, but not all of it. . . . When he gives words and follows them up
with an impression, then Feda knows it is right."
Feda : Do you know there are times when I really hear him, and yet
only get muddled sounds, not properly formed sounds. He says it again
and if it does not get clearer he has to show it or get it through in some
other way.
From the above remarks one gathers that " the power " was often I
insufficient in quantity, or possibly unsuitable in quality, for the con-
veyance to Feda of spoken words. Much more was it inadequate for
production of the direct voice whisper. At the date of these sittings there
had been comparatively little direct voice.
The full significance of this speaking in actual words will be discussed
later after the direct-voice usages have been classified and illustrated.
Having alluded to my observing the medium's actions during a sitting
it may be well to explain that there is plenty of light for this.
whereas in a direct voice " trumpet " sitting the darkness is complete
and every precaution taken to exclude rays of light, it is far otherwise with
Mrs Leonard's sittings. It is true that she prefers to have the curtain
drawn, as this makes it easier to enter the trance state ; but she is not
fastidious about excluding such light as may come from the side of the
curtain. Then, too, there is light from the lamp, which is merely covered
by a red silk handkerchief. In winter, also, the electric stove gives some
illumination. Within a few minutes of the commencement of a sitting
one's eyes, growing accustomed to the reduced light, can see around the
room, can watch the expression of the medium's face and every movement
of her body.
The Direct Voice Whispers classified and illustrated
From the hundreds of instances in which the Direct Voice (or whisper)
appears in records of recent years, I have selected many examples and 1
;
classified them under appropriate headings, as follows :

"
1 . D. V. supplies the required word when Feda hesitates.
Feda : That is when we usually av— av
—
D.V. : Avail
Feda : avail ourselves of, etc.
Feda : The conditions of my new life have impressed me more dr
—
D. V. : Dramatically
Feda : Dramatically, he calls it, than they have people who, etc.
Feda : When I saw familiar things around me I said, " Thank God!
Thank God! All the familiar and comforting things are here. I will
live up to^them, or I will hve up to the benef—, benef— "
D. V. : Beneficence which has given them to me.
2. D.V. supplies the required word when Feda asks for it.
(This is its most frequent use.)
Feda : Part of it may happen earlier, but he feels—What? The fill—
-
What?
D. V. : Fulfilment
Feda : The actual fulfilment of the prophecy, etc. •
.
Feda : It is not so much a matter of—What?
D. V. : Technical knowledge
Feda : of technical knowledge as, etc.
Feda : A great task lies before us of harmonising them as they—What ?
D. V. : Interpenetrate
Feda : Interpenetrate each other. That's what he says, harmonising
them. What did you say, please? You harmonise what?
D. V. : Notes
Feda : Notes. Wait a minute. I know what you are going to say. I
got it once. You harmonise notes in music before you play a chord.
Feda : He says, for years, let us call it, some—Some what? Some
something he said
—
D. V. : Prejudices .
Feda : Some prejudices about it, etc.
Feda : It is helpful when it is—enforced? Is that right?
C. Drayton Thomas [Part
D. V. : Reinforced
Feda : When it is reinforced by constructive thought.
Feda (A new Communicator had difficulty in making Feda understand.
She therefore appealed to my father to help her) : What did he say,
Mr John ?
D. V. : Trying to tell you something
Feda : Well, he's trying to tell me something all the time.
3. D. V. supplies the required word without its being asked for.
Feda : Can you remember talking to me about
—
D. V. : Italy
Feda : Italy, she says.
Feda : You cannot have sustained
—
D. V. : Communication •
Feda : Communication with us without, etc.
'
Feda : You are not to regard it
—
D. V. : In that light.
4, 5. D. V. sometimes commences a neiv topic, or gives assent, saying " Yes ".
6. D. V. sometimes expresses emphasis.
In illustration of this I quote from a record made by my friend, the
Rev. A. F. Webling, at his sitting of 26th August, 1942. His son is
giving what proved to be an accurate forecast of our victory at El Alamein,
which came to pass two months afterwards.
Feda : Father, I've got a date in my mind. As I told you, I don't
always know things about the future, especially about things' affecting us
personally. But in my mind recently a date keeps coming up. I ought to
say, two dates next to each other, something about 28th and 29th October,
something to do with the war, and I feel a turning-point of a very, very
vital kind. Very outstanding. I seldom get anything like that. It is as
if a little door opens and something pops out, almost as if it were thrown
out, saying, " Take that." And this date comes, and my own mind has to
interpret. And I interpret it as having a grave bearing on the war, which
will prove to our advantage.
D. V. : Father, I felt relief ! ,
Feda : I would like you to underline that.
7. The D. V. addresses Feda.
Feda : A new Communicator was characterised by Feda, who spoke
appreciatively of his sincerity and quickness in adapting himself to the
conditions of his new life, adding, " He was ready to do it."
D. V. : Thank you.
Feda : Thank you, he said.
C. D. T. : For your flattering remarks!
Feda : He says, I don't know that they were meant to be flattering, but I
think I may read a certain amount of truth in them.
(Later in the same sitting Feda broke into the Communicator's discourse
by citing another Communicator's way of expressing happiness), " He
would do a little hornpipe dance."
D. V. : / don't know what you mean !
Feda : No, I didn't say you were doing hornpipes, but that person did.
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 139
" Oh, did he do hornpipes? " he said. Well, yes, of course he did. Any-
body in their senses does.
D. V. : I don't!
Feda : You don't. Oh, he doesn't!
Feda had expressed in her own words what she considered the Com-
municator was intending by what he had transmitted to her in picture
form.
D. V. : Yes, put it that way.
Feda : Yes, I have done. He says, " Put it that way," as if I just
happened to get it as he would want to give it.
8. D. V. corrects Fedas mistakes. These instances are possibly of
special significance as one may suppose that Feda would not thus correct
herself.
Feda : At present it is clearer
—
D. V. : As clear
Feda : It is as clear—
Feda : Was there a path would go to some water? Would there be a
path to some water, do you know? She keeps saying, " path-water ;
path-water." I don't see any water in the garden, but I get a feeling you
could go out of the garden and there would be some special path to the
garden
—
D. V. : To the water
Feda : No, not to the garden, she says, but from the garden to the
water ; as if it would be looked upon as a private path. (This was a highly
important correction and saved an excellent piece of evidence, unknown
to me at the time, from being a failure. It correctly described something
no longer existing, but which I was able to verify from pictures in
archaeological books more than a century old.)
Feda : It is a break away of what you might call a grossly physical life—
D. V. : From
Feda : From a grossly physical life.
Feda : You couldn't pretend to be something other than you were not.
D. V. : Other than you were
Feda : Than you were, he says.
Feda : Tell her that he is happy, that he can see nothing in ^is Hfe
that he would wish altered.
D. V. : New life
Feda : In the new life that he would wish altered.
Feda : I am told I make—
D. V. : May make
Feda : I may-make little or no impression, but we shall see.
Feda : Is there someone, Jane?
D. V. : Jennie
Feda: Jennie, yes, that's right. He said it just as he was going. (The
speaker was my brother-in-law, who had always alluded to his sister as
Jennie. A fact which he would certainly remember.)
14° C. Drayton Thomas [Part
Feda : He talked to others about it, not just Mr John, but others, what
he calls his temptibles.
D. V. : Contemporaries
Feda : temporaries—contemporaries, those of my own age and outlook.
(In this case, as in some others, I am not sure that the mistaken pro-
nunciation was not intentional, an instance of Feda's facetiousness or
humour.)
9. D. V. corrects Feda's pronunciation.
Feda : Admiral idea, he says.
D. V. : Admirable
Feda : An admirable idea.
Feda: That absolves me. , •
•
, .
D. V. : Absolves
Feda : All right, Mr John— Wait a minute—That absolves me.
Feda : It's just as if things become separate, like the spectrum, he calls
it. (Then adding for herself—) A man once said Feda was a spectrum.
D. V. : Spectre, not spectrum!
Feda : He says, spectrum ;
everything get divided.
Feda : Remembering what you have heard, however f/agmentary
—
D. V. : Fragmentary
Feda : Fragmentary. Fragmentary.
D. V. : Fragmentary
Feda : I've said that two or three times! It explains much to them, and
it's an incentive to go further, say a book just read curs/«^ly— No.? Not
cursingly?
D. V. : Cursorily
Feda : Cur-so-ri-ly ; that's right, cursorily.
Feda : When I realised my surroundings it was a great surprise, I must
admit that. In spite of certain things I had read and heard, death struck
me as taking me to some empty—What do you call it.? Sone.? Empty
sone .?
D. V. : Zone
Feda : Empty zone.
Feda : The philos-Zophical standpoint
D. V. : Philosophical
Feda : Philo-lo-sophical
D. V. : Philosophical
Feda : All right, I've said it—standpoint.
Feda : But I can't remember
—
D. V. : Cannot
Feda : Cannot? Well, that's the same as can't. I cannot remember
where you knew me.
ID. D. V. corrects Feda's grammar.
Feda : The denser element number one will be very quickly overcome
before denser element number two arrives. That's what he says.
D. V. : Yes, that's just what I said.
173] New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 141
Feda : Connects with a circle with whom—
D. V. : With which
Feda : With which we are in touch.
Feda : We can incorporate the two.
D. V. : Incorporate
Feda : You did say incorporate. It sounded Hke incorporate. He said
something else too, something also just before it. Never mind, I've lost it.
I'm getting words now, so I lose them better.
D. V. : Worse
Feda : Oh! He says worse, not better.
11. D. V. contradicts Feda.
Feda : This gentleman is not quite used to fitting in with other people,
and with what they wish him to do. If you suggest anything to him he
doesn't jump at it. He waits to see if it was what he wants to do. He's
just like that.
D. V. : / am not!
Feda : Yes, you are. He's a good, kind man, but it's just a habit. I
feel he was an important person, that people thought a lot of and paid much
attention to his words. He says they didn't always pay attention, but it
would have been better if they had done so sometimes. . . . He is a funny
gentleman!
D. V. : Not funny .
'
:
Feda : Yes, you are.
Feda : This man's idiosyncrasy had become a fixed habit, his self-
indulgence in a habit— You mean habit of thought?
D. V. : I don't!
Feda : You don't! Oh, well, never mind.
Feda : He's talking about the sinner that repenteth! I think the sinner
that repenteth is an awful nuisance!
D. V. : No, he isn't.
'
Feda : Well, he soimds as if he is.
Feda : It must begin on the earth, as many myriads— You mean
millions?
D. V. : No, I don't.
Feda : Isn't it funny!
D. V. : No! -
Feda : He was always very serious.
D. V. : Not always!
Feda (Feda was describing a procession in church) : People were going
up and down and round the aisles, saying " Yum-yum-yum ", like that.
D. V. : They went round the church, but they did not say, " Yum, yum "!
12. D. V. exclaims, remonstrates or expostulates.
"~~
During a Communicator's deeply serious discourse, Feda made a
facetious allusion to my liking for jam puffs.
D. V. : / don't see where they come in now!
Feda: He says, Why they entered into this I don't know!
142 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
The name of Sir Oliver Lodge having been introduced, Feda remarked,
" You know he's the cleverest person ever lived "
—
D. V. : Not quite!
Feda : Well, he nearly is anyhow. Mr John says, " Not quite ", like
that, but Feda thinks he is.
(It appears that Feda was acquainted with the fact that Miriam, the
stenographer, was keeping rabbits.)
Feda : Sometimes dull tasks are the breeding-ground of better things.
Breeding? Yes, that's right—of better things—like Miriam's rabbits?
D. V. : Rabbits? What's rabbits?
Feda : Always breeding. Never mind. I was only telling him some-
thing.
Feda : I don't know what terms to use to convey to you the absorbing
interest of this life. Everything that one tackles and overcomes opens out
a vista of something else, even more interesting, that may be done. No
stalemate here, he says. (Feda seemed struck by the word " stalemate ",
repeating the word " mate " ; she then suggested it might mean an
undesirable wife, and informed me she knew a gentleman who had one.)
To this the Communicator replied
—
D. V. : / didn't mean that!
Feda : You didn't mean that? Well, never mind. He wants to say,
No deadlock, but always something open, something open again through
that, and something opening again.
Feda : She remembers about him, you see, and like when it's—when a
boy's been naughty and you wonder if he will be naughty again, do you
see?
C. D. : Nothing of the kind!
Feda: Nothing of the kind? She says. Nothing of the kind ; she's not
anticipating anything of the kind at all.
Feda : Your father says
—
D. V. : A few days out!
Feda : A few days out? What, out of bed?
D. V. : No, 710, no, no!
Feda: A few days out? Oh, Fll tell him. He was a few days out in his
reckoning about the war.
Feda : It seems as if the papers in this bag may be important and he will
want to impress her about some of them.
D. V. : Wrong idea.
Feda : I'm giving the wrong idea. Well, that's what he said.
Feda (trying to catch a required name) : There's a W connected with
it. Wellington? Wellington.'', I'm saying it.
D. V. : Not a bit like it!
Feda : Not a bit like it, Stuart? Melton—I haven't got it right.
(Before this sitting I had shown Mrs Leonard a garden thermometer
which I had recently bought. It is to this that Feda alludes in the fol-
lowing.) • ;

Feda : He says that the phenometer—phenomena—He's got a ther-
mometer !
D. V. : / was not talking about thermometers!
Feda : Oh, he says, phenomena. Is that right? The phenomena
referred to, etc.
Feda : Yes, Stuart says that's quite correct.
D. V. : Ifs not what I meant, though!
Feda : Through that very quality of recklessness and adventuresome--
There isn't such a word, Mr Theo.
D. V. : There is now!
Feda : Oh, there is now. All right. There is now, and he says, etc.
Feda : But now Willy—Willy—What? Who's he? Willy somebody—
I can't get his other name. Willy something is compelling you—Wait a
minute—I've mixed that up.
C. D. T. : I understand, Feda. You need not stop.
D. V. : // is not that at all!
Feda: Willy-nilly? Is that right? Willy-nilly, you are being compelled.
Feda : He says you must have good working—What? Hippopota-
muses ?
D. V. : Hypotheses
Feda (more loudly) : Hippopotamuses.
D. V. : Hypotheses—and don't shout!
Feda : I'm not shouting. I'm only speaking plainly. *
Feda : With his de- de- What? I never heard anyone use that word
before—demise?
C. D. T. explains the meaning of the word.
Feda : It's a stupid, ugly word. Demise! Demise! Can't you say
" passing over "?
D. V. : No!
Feda : No, he doesn't want to say passing over. Demise, well, anyhow,
after his demise she has been very lonely.
(Shortly after this little passage of arms, Feda herself took occasion to
introduce the word while transmitting for a different Communicator,
much to the latter 's disgust.) Thus
—
Feda : He will just go out, stop living on the earth and just demise to
his wife
—
D. V. : Don't say that!
Feda : That's what she ought to say. Go to her, do you see? He will
just—yes, just go to her, and he won't know anything about it, perhaps,
when the time comes.
13. The D. V. may be unheard by Feda.
Feda : He keeps on saying, Why have I been such—What did he call it?
Why have I been
—
D. V. : Chosen
Feda : Say it again, please. Why have I been
—
D. V. : Chosen
Feda: Chosen will do ; I'velost the word.
144 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
Feda : The whole tone of Hfe will be on a more artistic
—
D. V. : Plane.
Feda : What did you say? (I had heard this word clearly.) On a more
artistic plane than has hitherto been possible.
Feda : For their own progress, their own—Their own what?
D. V. : Unfoldment. (Both the stenographer and I heard this word
distinctly, but Feda apparently did not.)
Feda : Wait a minute. Their own what? Oh, unfoldment. Wait a
minute. It's not quite right.
D. V. : Unfoldment of their own powers.
14. The D. V. may be mis-heard by Feda.
Feda : Man was
—
D. V. : Then more bucolic.
Feda : More beautiful? No, something like beautiful, bu- something.
Bu- Can you hear him?
C. D. T. : Yes, I heard him say " bucolic ".
15. The D. V. may be only partly heard by Feda.
Feda : She says she has been many times to—Bic- Bic-
D. V. : Bickley.
Feda : I can't get that name ; it sounds like Bickley, but that isn't
right, it can't be.
Sitter : I heard her say it, Feda, and it is right.
Feda : You thought of that man and you thought of him with—What?
D. V. : Horror. (Feda : H—, h- .) (CDT. : The word is horror.)
Feda : They have to give a certain amount of 1 — 1—
.
D. V. : Latitude. (Feda : A certain amount of what?)
D. V. : Latitude.
Feda : Latitude to other people.
Whisperings which are only partly heard by the Sitter :
Their Special Significance
I have reserved until last a special class of D. V. whisper which seems
of great significance. It is important evidence for the correctness of the
hypothesis put forward in this paper.
Let the reader recall some evening in the country when, in windy
weather, he listened to the sound of distant bells. A gust of wind brings
the sound strongly for a moment ;
then, as the wind falls, the sound dies
away into silence, although the bells are ringing steadily all the time.
" The sound upon the fitful gale
In solemn-wise did rise and fail ;
.
Like that wild harp whose magic tone ';
Is wakened by the wind alone." (Scott.)
In like manner the sitter hears part only of some D. V. sentences,
part only of some words ; the speaker is giving the whole, but a lull in
the emanation prevents the whole being voiced in air and so carried to the
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 145
sitter's ear. Thus " the fitful gale " would seem an apt simile for the ebb
and flow of psychic emanation which permits part of a word, or sentence,
to be heard, yet fails to carry the remainder.
Here are examples of D. V. which are incomplete, the beginning or the
ending having been inaudible to the sitter and to the stenographer.
Single words.
For the^word " dogmatize " D. V. said " dog—".
For " Beethoven " the D. V. spoke the first syllable, " Beet—".
Feda : Wait a minute, please. Who's that? Who's J. K..' Have I got
that right.' Jakey.' Jakey?
D. V. : Jaki. (Note the first part of this name only is sounded.)
Feda : JK? I don't know whether he was saying a name like Jakey.
C. D. T. : All right, Feda. You nearly got it. The actual name he
tried for is Jakins. (An old friend of Communicator's with whom he had
shared rooms in Harley Street for many years.)
Feda : It's such a funny name.

only partly voiced :

148 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
The Special Significance of these Partly-Voiced
Words and Phrases
It would seem from the above examples that the Communicator speaks
in the ordinary way while giving his messages and discourse to Feda.
But though he speaks in the ordinary way, as we do, his body is far
other than ours ; it is not composed of matter, but of something which
vve may term a physical substance, without venturing to affirm more
about it.
Being non-material, it cannot affect material things, not even the air.
Hence the Communicator's speaking, however audible to Feda, is usually
quite inaudible to the sitter.
What his speaking does is to cause vibrations in the field of psychic
emanation, and it is these vibrations which bring to Feda the auditory
impression ; for her bodily form is of like substance with that of the
Communicator, and therefore sensitive to the vibrations of the emanation.
But what cannot be done directly can be accomplished indirectly.
The emanation, being a sort of go-between, linking the material world
with the realm beyond reach of our five senses, can, when acting with
sufficient force, cause vibrations in air. These secondary vibrations are
heard as whispered words.
Were the emanation of suitable density, and moved with sufficient
vigour by the speaker's vocal organs, we should hear his words as distinctly
as if he were a mortal speaking in the room. And that is exactly what one
does hear in the so-called Trumpet sittings : those sittings in the dark for
the Direct Voice with physical voice mediums. I have studied that
phenomenon with eleven different mediums, attending, in all, twenty-
seven Direct Voice sittings. From this number I would wish to subtract
about half, because they were unsatisfactory in that no good evidence was
forthcoming, and in two of them I strongly suspected that the mediums
were themselves whispering through the trumpet.
In the six best cases there were splendid manifestations of voice. I
doubt if any adequate impression of it can be conveyed in description to
those who have had no experience of it. One hears from the Control a
clear, ringing voice in the darkness, speaking from the further end of the
room ; then a loud whisper close in front which brings to your memory
some event of long ago in which the speaker took part. Then the voice
of the Control again breaks in and makes some announcement about the
conditions of the circle before introducing another speaker. The whisper-
ing voice of a Communicator usually comes from close in front of the
person addressed ; while the Control speaks from anywhere in the room,
high up or low down, inside the circle of sitters or outside it, but never, I
think, quite close to the medium.
Nor are all the voices alike ;
they vary as would voices in any social
gathering ;
men's and women's, young and aged. Sometimes one will
sing with full and cultured voice, male singing with a woman medium, or
the whistling of tunes in masterly style. Foreign languages are spoken by
some Communicators while in dialogue with a sitter who can speak in the
same tongue. On the first occasion of hearing this I questioned the lady
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 149
sitter afterwards, asking if the talk had "been evidential. She replied that
the speaker was a Scandinavian whom she had known in her youth.
Another told me that the unseen friend had talked in dialect pronunciation
which no Englishman could imitate without detection. This was said by
an Indian Prince ; and a similar personal testimony was given about a
dialogue in Scotch.
In general, the medium's Control, or Controls, speak the loudest and
with fullest voice, while the Communicators vary from hoarse whispers,
not too distinct in small circles or with an indifferently gifted medium, to
clear, full voice with the best mediums.
This is a most inadequate description of what I have myself heard, but
it may suffice to indicate that there is good ground for asserting that the
Direct Voice does not proceed from the lips of the medium and is not to be
mistaken for ventriloquism.
If, then. Direct Voice in dark seances is produced at distance from the
medium, there is nothing surprising in finding the same thing taking
place in Mrs Leonard's sittings. The conviction that it there emanates
from some distance in front of her is thus supported.
The Foregoing Observations supported by Other Sitters
The evidence which has been adduced in support of my hypothesis
would be strengthened if it were reproduced with a number of other
sitters. Others have indeed given me their impressions, impressions
which, so far as they go, entirely agree with my own findings. But we
require stenographic records which show clearly what was spoken by the
direct whisper and what preceded and followed it. This is, I fear, a
demand which cannot be met by many.
Happily, there are two which have been brought to my notice. The
first is from the late Robert Blatchford's book, More Things in Heaven and
Earth, and the second is a paper written by Mrs Conan Shaw for my
inspection when she heard that I was interested in the Direct Voice.
Mr and Mrs Shaw have had some sittings with Mrs Leonard in recent
years and were struck by this particular manifestation the more strongly
as they were having home sittings in the hope of developing Direct Voice.
Robert Blatchford
Robert Blatchford in his book. More Things in Heaven and Earth, writes
of a sitting with Mrs Leonard on 23rd September, 1923, as follows :
"Away from the medium and away from me, my wife spoke directly to
me. She said, in an eager, anxious tone, '
Bob, I'm here. I am with you,
Bob.' Before I could recover my presence of mind Feda began to speak
again and I lost the chance to reply. But it was my wife's voice I heard
and she pronounced the word Bob as she always did when with us. I
think it is suggestive that she spoke my name twice. I had always said
that if I heard a medium utter my name in that way I should think the
evidence important.
" When I related that incident in The Sunday Chronicle several readers
suggested that I had imagined I heard the voice. . . . But my wife had
150 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
been dead nearly two years, and I had never imagined I heard her speak
until I sat with Mrs Leonard (pp. 92-3).
" It was on the 23rd of September, 1923, when my wife spoke to me.
On the I St of June, 1924, at my second sitting, I asked Feda if my wife
really had spoken to me, or if I had imagined it. Feda said. She spoke to
you.- It is a thing that does not happen in hundreds of sittings with me.
There was a lot of power, (p. 26.)
" On the 19th of November, 1923, at a sitting of the Johannesburg
circle, a message, purporting to come from my wife, was written automati-
cally by Mrs Purchas. I quote the message in full as reported by Mr
Purchas, and with it his note appended.
'
Will you tell Barb that I am now very happy, as he is of my faith?
Strange that it should have taken your South African Circle to tell my
dear husband that I am alive. We are most grateful. No, I will not sign
yet—can't have everything at once.'
'
Note.—I have underlined the word above because it was written-
exactly as transcribed here. Whether or not that was done to convey an
inflexion known to you, but unknown to us, I cannot, of course, say.'
" My wife always pronounced my name as spelt in the above message.
But it was quite impossible for anyone in the circle to know that. How
then did the word Bob come to be written Barb.''
" At the sitting with Mrs Leonard on the 23rd of September, 1923,
when my wife spoke directly to me, she pronounced my name Barb, and
she used the name twice, as if on purpose to convince me of her identity.
'
Barb, I'm here. I am with you. Barb.'
" Now one would suppose that Feda heard my wife speak to me. Yet,
on the ist of June, 1924, Feda repeatedly addressed me as '
Mr Bob '.
She had not picked up the inflexion. How then did the inflexion get into
an automatic message given at a distance of 7,000 miles to a group of
sitters not one of whom had ever heard my wife speak? "
(pp. 102-3.)
Variation in the Direct Voice Phenomena
During Robert Blatchford's sitting of 12th June, 1924 he asked Feda
if his wife had really spoken to him. She said, " It is a thing that does not
happen in hundreds of sittings with me." So it would seem that at this
date the D. V. was at its early beginning in Mrs Leonard's sittings. It was
then rare and did not much attract my attention ;
my notes merely record
that I could often hear my father's whispers, which Feda repeated aloud.
It is within the last dozen years that the amount of D. V. has so markedly
increased. Its frequency varies from sitting to sitting. In one it may be
heard only six times, speaking a total of from twelve to fifteen words in
all ; at another sitting it may be heard as many as twenty-five times,
speaking about sixty words. Calculation based on some thirty of the
more recent occasions gives an average of eighteen times and twenty-six
words.
I think this difl^erence from sitting to sitting depends on the amount and
quality of emanation given out by medium and sitter ; their physical
and mental conditions vary according to circumstances. For instance, I
am writing this on my return from a sitting which gave only nineteen
I
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 151
D. V. words, and several of these were whispered too faintly to be under-
stood. This is most unusual, as one generally hears the whisper quite
distinctly, with no doubt whatever as to the word or words. What was
the reason for so poor a manifestation? I incline to attribute it to two
causes ;
my own weariness and the heaviness of the atmosphere. My
feelings on going to this sitting were of languor and sleepiness, increased
no doubt by attendance during the night on a restless invalid. The day
had been damp, mild and enervating, and during the sitting Feda asked
me to reduce the heat of the electric stove, as the Communicator was
complaining of heaviness in the atmosphere of the room—a most rare
request! Hence I doubt if either Mrs Leonard or I could give out our
usual psychic contribution.
In the majority of sittings the D. V. comes in patches. It will occur
two, three or even four times on one page of my records, and not again for
several following pages. At other times it appears on several successive
pages, after which many blank pages follow before it occurs again.
What is the significance of this tendency of the D. V. to come in patches?
I think it points to an unequal pouring forth of the emanation ; when this
comes freely there is more likelihood of the D. V. being produced. When
it comes less freely the D. V. is difficult or even impossible.
Besides this, there is evidence that something in the early part of the
sitting facilitates the D. V., and that towards the latter part this something
fails to act. This would agree with a slowing down of the output of
emanation as the sitting passes the half-way point. It is as if power were
vigorously produced shortly after the sitting starts, and reaches one or
more peaks, after which it fails, may be suddenly or gradually.
The figures given on an adjoining page (see sketch-plan showing wave
peaks) bear out the statement of Communicators that the power varies in
strength from moment to moment and is all the time being used up, so
that towards the close of a sitting difficulties arise. They say that they
can give more easily when the power is strong and often fail in doing what
they attempt because the power has weakened.
The final minutes of most sittings are used by my Communicators for
taking personal control of the medium, and they usually remark towards
the end of their speaking that the power is failing and they must therefore
stop. If I detain them longer by questions, an increasing slowness and
faintness of speech becomes marked, and they seem to be struggling
against difficulties of expression as well as of recollection. They may even
refuse to continue, explaining that they might inadvertently say something
silly, or quite other than intended.
We may therefore conclude that this mysterious power flows with
intermittent or irregular force, that it gradually diminishes as the sitting
proceeds, and that its exhaustion inevitably brings the sitting to an
end.
It seemed desirable to ascertain by counting whether the instances of
D. V. were evenly distributed throughout a sitting, or whether they tended
to come more frequently at some one or more parts.
My sitting records are uniformly typed on pages of the same size, and
that part in which Feda controls has an average of twenty-four pages.
Counting the number of times the D. V. was heard, and also the total
C. Drayton Thomas [Part
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 153
number of words so spoken, I find that the first twelve pages of 50 records
show 452 instances of D. V. which produced 951 words ; whereas in the
final twelve pages the figures were 156 times and 292 words.
This reveals the existence of some cause which favours thrice as much
D. V. in the first half of a sitting as in its latter half.
To discover more minutely where the incidence fell, I divided the
twenty-four pages into four sets. The result was :
In pp. 1-6 the D. V. came 292 times, speaking 593 words.
7-12 ,, ,, ,, 160 ,, „ 358
13-18 ,, 106 ,, ,, 199
19-24 " " " 50 » " 93
This shows that something favouring production of the D. V. rapidly
diminishes as the sitting proceeds towards its close.
Wishing to discover whether some Communicators had shown more
ability than others to produce words in the D. V., I examined a large
number of the more recent records. Naturally those who spoke more
frequently and lengthily had most impressed me ;
they had undoubtedly
produced more D. V. than had the less frequent and less lengthy speakers ;
but would their average of D. V. words per page be less or more? I could
not guess.
Having obtained the average of D. V. words per page for seven chief
Communicators I found them arranged in the following order :
E.C. T.N.K. Stuart Father Etta McD. Mother
2-8 1-8 1-5 1-5 1-3 i-i i-o
But this result was inconclusive, since those who spoke most would
more frequently have spoken during periods when the power was un-
favourable. It seemed necessary to make another calculation, counting
only those pages on which D.V. words were recorded, and omitting
all those during which the power was presumably insufficient to produce
D. V. Here is the result :
Stuart T.N.K. E.C. Father Mother McD Etta
27 2-3 2-2 1-9 1-8 1-6 1-2
It will be noticed that, by both methods, the same three Communicators
come first, while another three come last. This seems to indicate a
difference in ability to produce D. V.
Is there any significance in the fact that E. C, T. N. K. and Stuart
show greater facility in producing D. V. than do others.'' This much is
certain ; E. C. is the one who always speaks under the greatest emotional
stress. Stuart was a practised lecturer and, when deeply interested, very
emphatic, whether on the platform or in ordinary conversation. Why my
cousin, T. N. K., should score so well is difficult to say. He was an easy
talker ; but so were my mother and Etta! He was a medical specialist
and therefore accustomed to give his opinion with authority, as also when
on the Bench as a London J. P. But I incline to think that his marked
success in producing the D. V. is more closely related to the subject
matter of his communications. This he evidently considered to be of
grave importance, and he may therefore have deemed that it merited more
154 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
emphatic announcement than commonplace matter would have done. Be
this as it may, the figures show that the D. V. does not come by chance ;
the moods and mental characteristics of the speaker are decisive factors!
These Direct Voice Whispers do not proceed from
THE Medium's Lips
I am aware that a critic's first reaction to this paper will be to suggest to
himself that I, and other of Mrs Leonard's sitters, have been misled in
supposing that the D. V. comes from some point in space away from the
medium ;
they will incline to think that, in fact, it came from her lips.
1 hasten to assure him that there is no question possible in the mind of
those who have heard it often. The D. V. does not proceed from the
medium's lips, neither is it possible to confuse it with any whisper which
Feda may make through those lips. I am always able, just before Feda
greets me, to hear her whispered mutterings in apparent conversation
with the Communicator. I can catch a word here and there, " Yes, I'll
tell him. Yes, Feda mustn't forget," but the grammar and characteristic
is always distinctly and unmistakably Feda's own. Between this and the
D. V. whisper of the Communicators there is wide difference.
Moreover, the latter comes from a different place. Feda's whisper
proceeds from Mrs Leonard's lips ; the D. V. comes from a spot some
2 ft. to 3 ft. in front of the medium.
Implications of D. V.
Hitherto it has always been possible for the critics to suggest that the
evidence of identity offered by the Communicator was given telepathically,
{a) coming from some mind or minds on earth which possessed the
information, or {b) from a discarnate personality who was not necessarily
in the seance room at the time, or (c) if in the room, not possessing any
bodily form.
I think it will be difficult to maintain either of these suppositions in view
of the evidence above given for an actual presence of the Communicator,
and the necessity for assuming that he has a bodily form by means of
which he speaks to Feda and occasionally produces the D. V.
This conclusion brings with it a confirmation which supports the view
usually arrived at by sitters who deem that they have been in actual
conversation with departed friends. I know this conclusion seems too
simple to be true, and that therefore critics have exercised their imagination
to devise alternative explanations. These alternatives have never seemed
satisfactory to me, and now, after my long experience with Mrs Leonard,
and many other trance sensitives, they seem more than ever to be fancies
based on guesses, without foundation in observed fact or experimental
results.
How Direct Voice Whispers are produced
The Direct Voice Whispers are caused by vibrations in air ; these are
secondary results due to primary vibrations of the emanation set up by
the words which the Communicator speaks within it.
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 155
Let me here repeat the hypothesis. Communicators can no more
produce a voice in air than they can move physical objects—direct and
without some intermediary. But there is an intermediary which is suffi-
ciently akin to the substance of the Beyond to be usable by discarnates,
and sufficiently akin to our matter to affect it under certain conditions.
These conditions are in operation when a Communicator makes use of it
to levitate, say, a table in the seance room, or to speak at a trumpet-voice
seance. At the latter one hears the clear and ringing voice of the well-
practised Control and the rather more laboured voices, or (in the poorer
sittings) whispers, of the Communicators. In the Leonard sittings the
Communicators occasionally catch a denser wave of the emanation which
produces such vibration in air as results in vocal sound, much like a weak
trumpet sitting. I think the D. V. is also favoured by any special emphasis
in a Communicator's speaking.
This secondary result is not difficult to understand. We know how the
wind, which can make but little impression upon stone, can arouse such
force in waves of the sea that solid stone breakwaters are smashed. The
sea waves are intermediate between air and stone. Similarly, in these
sittings the impalpable emanation can be set into such violent action by
the Communicator's speech that it vibrates the air and so produces
words.
Perhaps a better analogy is offered by electricity. The Induction Coil
in its simplest form shows us how sound can be produced, by the action of
an intermediary, from a current of electricity which, by itself, makes no
sound. If wires connected with the poles of a torch battery are brought
together and separated several times a succession of tiny sparks will be
noticed. These are either soundless, or only audible to very keen ears.
But if this slight current be passed through a coil of wire, which is sur-
rounded by an insulated coil of very fine and very long wire, one gets an
audible spark from the terminals of this secondary coil each time the
current starts or is broken in the primary coil. In the Induction Coil there
is a contact make-and-break attachment which permits a very rapid
succession of sparks which crackle in the air. In using this we have
{a) the primary electric current of the inner coil which produces no clearly
audible sound ; the make-and-break of this causes {b) an induced current
in the outer coil, and the terminals of the latter, when brought close
together, produce (c) a series of sparks which crackle loudly. Thus, by
means of an intermediary, the soundless current {a), making use of the
induced current {b), causes sounds in air (c).
This may serve to illustrate my idea of the way in which the soundless
words of the Communicator, stir at times the intermediate circle of psychic
emanation from the medium, which in its turn produces sufficient
vibration in air to be heard as the direct voice whispers.
Another analogy is provided by electric traction. The make-and-break
of electric current flowing round a magnet causes machinery to work by a
succession of pulls. That electric current, by itself, is powerless to move
wheels, but it produces a magnetic field by which the adjusted iron of the
mechanism is pulled into motion. Thus we find electricity and magnetism,
neither of which are perceptible to human senses, producing results in
mechanical movement. This analogy seems particularly good, since
C. Drayton Thomas [Part
electricity alone would be powerless ; the magnetism, however, is somehow
inseparable from it, and is the intermediary by which mechanical action
can be produced.
Have we any further confirmation of the actual bodily presence of
Communicators at the sittings? For such confirmation I recount a few of
the statements made by Communicators, with indications that Feda sees
the speakers and that they occupy definite places in the room.
Contributory Support for the Hypothesis :
Communicators claim to have bodies.
It would seem that Feda can see the Communicators.
Communicators are indicated as occupying definite places in the
seance room.
Communicators claim to have Bodies
Feda : He says, Now this body, this body in which one finds oneself
after death—this body is indeed a body. It seems to be very much more
a body, a material body, than I had supposed would be possible.
Feda : Your mother's here. She's in front and looking so well. She
says you will see her one day and she says you will be quite satisfied with
her appearance and health and well-being. She thinks that was one of the
very first satisfying things that she felt when she knew that she had got
to the other side—to look at everyone, at your father and Etta and many
others, and to see how extremely well they all looked, how bodily well.
Then she says rapidly, " Do try to get people out of the idea that this life
is a kind of vague thought-existence." She knows that many people have
a vague fear at back of their minds that it is only a thought-body. She
doesn't know what a thought-body means to them, but supposes it must
be an imaginary body. " There is nothing imaginary about it, unless you
would call your present body an imaginary one. It would be equally
wrong to call ours an imaginary body. Our bodies are our own bodies,
they belong to us."
Had my mother been versed in philosophical thought it is possible that
she would have phrased the above distinction more clearly. As it is, her
meaning is at least clear in the sense that to her, and to those around her,
there is nothing dream-like about her body. To her it seems much as
when on earth it felt firm to the touch and was visible to others. Also it
remains so and does not appear and disappear like a mental picture.
Their life is not like a dream in which one lives in a world of one's own,
but like this world when we awake from sleep to share it and its experiences
with other people.
The hypothesis around which this paper is written may help us to
realize somewhat more clearly than before the nature of the other-world
body. For we find that when a Communicator comes to the seance room
his body can affect the air by producing audible words in it ; also that
this is accomplished by a temporary use of that which emanates from the
medium, and is itself akin to the other-world body, although still attached
to the physical organism of the medium and, to that extent, in a somewhat
different condition.
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 157
This difference of condition (in the psychic emanation, as compared
with that of the other-world body), may be analogous to the different
conditions of water. Water remains simply HgO whether used to blow
a steam whistle, or to float a ship, or when existing invisibly as dampness in
the air.
In our work-a-day thinking we use images supplied by earthly experience
and we speak of these in terms of our native tongue. The learned, when
pressing into the unknown, formulate their conceptions in special terms,
such as " fourth dimension " ; but for ordinary people this is usually
difficult to follow. Even to conceive of solid objects as expressing to our
senses just one aspect of the intricate patterns of electric energy requires a
mental effort for which the age-long ancestral struggle for protection,
provender and progeny has but poorly equipped us.
Suffice it that we can realize that there are certain aspects of reality
which we find it difficult to understand. Among these are the other-world
body and the kindred mediumistic emanation, the two which chiefly
concern us in this paper.
If we accept the statements of Communicators about their bodily form
and its substantial reality we need no longer be puzzled as to how Feda is
able to describe a speaker with such accuracy that, on reading the descrip-
tion, the relatives remark that it is more accurate than they themselves
could have given. As many of these descriptions are of persons entirely
unknown to me—people who came to give evidence for friends who had
requested me to hold a proxy sitting for them—it is obvious that Feda is
not reading my mind or obtaining a mental picture of the deceased from
me. The explanation is simple when we visualize the Communicator
standing before Feda and letting her describe him as she sees him there.
It would seem that Feda can see the Communicator
Remarks by Feda, about to be quoted, imply that she can see Com-
municators and observe their actions. Such sight would seem to refer to
her own personal organism ; for the medium's eyes are fast closed
throughout the sitting. But since Feda, while in control, is making use
of the medium's organism, the latter's sense of sight might possibly be in
action despite the fast-closed eyes. One does not know.
During the discourse of a Communicator who had been a tutor and a
minister Feda several times remarked, " Oh, dear, he is going like that,"
and the medium's hands moved up and down.
Feda will mention that a Communicator is smiling, as in the following :
" Casting one's bread upon the waters with a due—he is smiling—and
necessary knowledge of the tides!
"
Breaking off suddenly, Feda says, " What did you want? Oh, well, I'll
just tell him you're here, but you mustn't interrupt. It's that other
Mr John—the Mr Lamond."
Feda : May I say a little about the lady first? I see she's changed
places with the boy.
Feda (alluding to my father who seemed to think that my sister was
telling me more than was discreet) : Oh, what's Mr John pulling faces
for? Well, she's not saying too much, Mr John.
C. Drayton Thomas [Part
Feda will mention that someone is nodding the head, as in the following :
" I think he's been near you at times lately. He says he has. He is
nodding his head."
Feda : Your mother is nodding her head a little, like that ; she says
it is quite true.
Feda : The ancestor is here. I thought he was here before, but just
then he went like that to me. (Medium's hands make a signalling move-
ment.)
Feda : Etta's just pulling Howard's sleeve ;
" You mustn't go on too
long! " and he looked down and said, " Quite! " so it was all right.
In the midst of Feda's transmission for an old friend there came a
rather faint but very clear " Hallo! " in the D. V.
Feda : She says, You cannot see me? She is close to you.
C. D. T. asked where exactly the lady was standing. In reply I was told
to hold out my hand, which the medium then guided.
Feda : Hold it there. She has hers pressing it. Perhaps you can feel
it. (I was not able to feel anything.)
Feda : Elsie is here. I don't know if she has been there or not, I
couldn't really quite see ; I didn't see her before. Is she coming in,
Mrs John? AH right. Elsie is being very polite to mother, letting her
speak and drawing back again when she thought I was going to cut mother
off. Elsie's waving her hand to go on, so it's all right. (A little later on)
All right, Elsie. The others have drawn to one side a bit and I think
Elsie can come in and speak now.
Feda : While she is talking I am getting a rather long name beginning
with " R " and I feel I ought to give it you just here. It is a name with
several letters. She is nodding her head, so I know I've got something
that is right.
Feda (in the midst of a discourse when the Communicator was about to
make a striking disclosure, Feda remarked) :
" And then he comes close
to you and says—."
While T. N. K. was speaking Feda twice remarked that his hand was
going up and down as he talked. She suited the action to the words by
moving the medium's arm, raising and lowering it several times in succes-
sion.
On another occasion, and with a ditferent speaker, the medium's hand
was raised, as if in warning, while Feda said, " I had to be awful careful
because Etta kept saying, " Wait, wait, don't try to explain," because of
what I thought it was. She kept on, " Don't explain. Wait! Wait!
"
C. D. T. : Did she wave a monitory finger at you, holding up her hand
like that?
Feda : Yes, like that.
Then we have the following kind of picture, in which the doings of the
Communicators are described, together with their words.
Feda : Now Sir Oliver is standing up—and you know how polite he is.
He's bowing to your mother, do you see? because he found that he had got
a little in front of her. You see your mother was there—(the medium's
hand points). She generally comes here (hand points again), your father
here and Etta there (hand points for each, direction). And mother had
moved back a bit and Sir Oliver didn't know that he was in front of her,
173] ^ New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 159
do you see? So he turned round and he went like that (medium bows)
Hke he did when he went up to ask ladies to dance with him. Mother isn't
going to dance with him. I don't think mother does dance. But that's
what he's doing. Your mother says, " No, no, no ;
you go on." And he
said " No," because your mother hadn't even been able to say Good
morning. So mother says it now.
(All this was very lifelike, exactly as, say, an observer for the B.B.C.
would describe what was taking place from moment to moment at some
function.)
^ - •
Communicators are indicated as occupying Definite Places
IN THE Seance Room
Feda : Stuart's over there, but father's here, near me. That's why
he's talking.
Feda (breaking off in the midst of my father's talk) : Oh! . . . What
does she want? Do you remember Marion? She has just looked in.
She is there (pointing).
Feda : Don't come so close, Fanny. Don't come quite so close. I
don't like them to come close, because I don't breathe so easily. (While
saying this the medium coughed and waved Fanny away by hand move-
ments.)
(While transmitting for another Communicator Feda suddenly said,
amid a succession of little coughs by the medium) : She came awful close,
and that made me cough ; it stops the throat. When they feel deeply
they get drawn close without noticing it.
Feda : What did you say, please, Etta ? What did you say ? Oh,
wait a minute. Yes, I see he's there. What does he want to say ? Wait
a minute. Oh, it's that Mr William, do you remember ? He sends his
greetings. I don't know why he is speaking to Stuart : he and Stuart
seem to be rather friendly.
While a Communicator named Marion was in ,the midst of discourse, a
lady who had previously spoken in the sitting intervened to give an
opinion. Feda seemed to realize that this interruption was likely to cause
confusion, and appealed to my sister, saying, " Perhaps Etta will take her
out into the garden a bit. Just take her away a minute. That's better.
Yes, that's all right. Now you go on, Marion."
Feda had remarked on my mother's interest in watching an ancestor
then present, and I said, " You are very observant, Feda." She replied,
" If you were where Feda is, and doing the work Feda's doing, you
couldn't help noticing these things. I notice things which your mother
doesn't know she is doing. When the ancestor is there and your mother is
there (hand points to right and to left) your mother sometimes moves two
steps that way so as to look at him better, so as to watch him. It's as if
she's watching him, Mr Draytie, to see if he means something more than
he's saying, because it has to do with you. Perhaps she doesn't know that
she does it, do you see? and—What? No, she certainly hadn't been aware
of doing it. Mr John thinks I am right.
The above remarks by Feda are selected from records covering several
years. They imply that she sees Communicators present in the room and
i6o C. Drayton Thomas • .
[Part
can both observe their movements and hear their spoken words. Mean-
while all else goes to support this ; I notice nothing to cast a doubt on it.
Yet it would, of course, remain unconvincing were it not for {a) the
arresting accuracy of the many-sided and multiplied evidential portions of
the messages, and {b) a compelling sense of the presence and characteristics
of the persons purporting to speak.
The combined result of these features gives much the same impression
as does a conversation over the telephone, save that one does not hear that
identifying personal quality of voice which is usually recognizable over the
phone. I do not suggest that talks through a medium are as free and
unrestricted as over the phone ; for that would be to press the similarity
unduly. But the similarity is there, as those who have enjoyed a really
good sitting (and not allowed its impression to fade with time!) will
realize.
Add this to the evidence provided by direct-voice whispers and it will
be realized that my hypothesis for the real presence of an embodied
Communicator is sufficiently strong to warrant my whole-hearted belief.
CONCLUSION
In the course of my twenty-eight years of Leonard sittings there has been
nothing to throw doubt on Feda's ability to see and accurately describe the
Cornmunicators, and also to hear their spoken words. This ability seems
to differ from our use of eyes and ears in that Feda habitually uses only
one of these senses at a time, and not the two together as do we. Whether
she cannot see and hear at the same moment, or whether it is her habit to
concentrate on one at a time, I do not know, nor does it concern our present
quest ;
suffice it that she certainly gives constant and abundant proof
that she can see, and equally compelling proof that she can hear actual
words, while the sitter hears nothing but her voice.
And then, during the gitting, everything happens exactly as if the Com-
municator were just in front of the medium and at the sitter's left shoulder ;
that means that he occupies a definite position in space.
It would be difficult to accept the above without admitting that the
Communicator is present in body, even if we are unable to picture exactly
what kind of substance forms the body which to our senses remains
intangible and invisible. We have quoted sufficient to show that Feda
and Communicator stoutly assert such bodies.
At this point some readers will think that reference should have been
made to exteriorization of the etheric body and also to full-bodied
materializations. But I think it best to deal only with those aspects of
psychic manifestation which I have personally experienced, and experi-
enced repeatedly year after year through more than 500 sittings. Those
readers who have studied the physical phenomena of the seance room will
be able to add support for my hypothesis.
The new evidence which is adduced in this paper concerns the direct
voice in Leonard sittings. It is difficult to believe that this voice could be
produced without a producer, and a producer who was using bodily organs
of some kind for his speech.
173] A New Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 161
It is unnecessary for the purpose of this article to allude to the view held
by Theosophists that certain changes will take place successively in one's
other-world body, or perhaps that it already consists of a succession of
bodies one within the other like the skins of an onion. This paper does
not go beyond the view that the other-world body is essentially the one
which we already possess, but which does not come into its full activity
until it has broken free from the flesh at death.
The Psychic Emanation
It is obvious that the phenomena of good mediumistic sittings depend
on the presence of something which is either absent from the happenings
of mankind's daily life, or is not acting there in the same' conditions and
manner. What is this mysterious something? In my view we find, in
the facts adduced above, sufficient to indicate that it is something pro-
ceeding from the medium. Although imperceptible and intangible, it may
be studied by the results which its presence makes possible. Modern
science has made great discoveries by inferring, from results observed,
the nature of invisible things ; in similar manner we can infer the presence
of this psychic emanation and something about its nature. It would seem
to differ from any substance known to science, and to be closely related
to the nervous energy of the physical body. What is the difference between
a living body and the same body immediately after its life has been extin-
guished by a stroke of lightning.-' " Its life is gone," we say. But what
exactly is that " life ", the absence of which leaves but a corpse devoid of
energy and mental action?
It may be that we are correctly informed when Communicators assert
that the power, or emanation, coming from the medium brings with it,
or contains, something of her living energy and therefore of her mind.
It is not exactly material, but seems on the border line between matter
and spirit (Spirit being thought of as the energizing and life-sustaining
factor). If then this emanation partakes of both this world and of an
existence beyond it, we have here the intermediate substance which makes
possible the interaction between matter in the brain and the Self v/hich
interprets nerve impulses coming from the five senses. We see, feel, etc.
and we perceive thereby our material environment. In lowly forms of life,
such as insects and animals, this takes place in low degree. In higher
forms of life, as with ourselves, it takes place in higher degree. In mentally
alert and in spiritually minded people it would seem to act in a degree yet
higher. In the psychically sensitive it enables a mode of seeing, hearing,
feeling and impression which is independent of the five physical senses.
The Non-Material Body
Our earth and its material objects are perceived by us because they are
in a certain condition. Were they reduced to the gaseous state, or to their
ultimate electric forces, they would no longer be perceptible to our senses.
When we change from our habitation in the physical body and find
ourselves in an etherial one, our etherial senses will no longer be in cor-
respondence with material objects, but with etherial environment.
l62 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
Hence visitants from the Beyond speak of our doors and walls as misty
and penetrable ;
they speak of their ability to move through them without
hindrance or inconvenience, much as mist blows through wire netting or
the leafless trees of winter. j
By analogy it might be said that, on the chessboard of reality, they move
'
on the white squares while we move on the black ; hence each moves ,
freely without impeding the other. I
It is not easy to realize the real presence in our home of one who died,
*
and whose body we saw buried. Repeated evidence given through
sensitives to whom we are strangers is arresting ; it often describes with
accuracy objects in our private room, and conversations of which none
outside the house could know. It is so difficult to picture the invisible
Communicator noting these trifles in order that he may off'er them as
evidence of his visit ; so difficult, indeed, that every kind of alternative
explanation is toyed with rather than accept the simple truth. Some of
these guessed alternatives are ingenious, and the most effective of them
embody such half-truths that it is, perhaps, the more scholarly and
intellectual persons who are most influenced by them. j
We are so accustomed to depend on the senses of sight, sound and touch \
that inference from observed facts, our own and those of others, seems
too frail a cord on which to hang a stupendous fact.
For without doubt the presence with us, from time to time, of those
whom we have long regarded as " departed ", gone for ever, would be as
pulverising to a multitude of accepted ideas as was the atomic bomb to
Hiroshima. I should not have said " the presence ", but rather a firm ,
acceptance of it as a fact based on adequate evidence. To conventional i
minds such a revolutionary fact would require, not merely adequate
evidence, but its general acceptance by society. Until clergy, doctors and
scientists believe, and the Press broadcasts it, why should one risk ridicule i
by professing belief.'' And so ulterior motives and fears are called in to
excuse hesitancy and incredulity.
But the prize is great! No unnecessary risks should be accepted ;
yet
independent thought and conclusions, firmly based on ascertained fact,
Bhould be forthcoming by at least one here and there ; and where such an
one leads to-day the multitude will follow on some radiant to-morrow.
For myself, I have no trace of doubt. I know that the invisibles visit
my home ;
yet I have not the sensitivity needed for clairvoyant glimpse of
them, the clairaudience, or the convincing feeling of their nearness! Some ;
have these gifts and I envy them ; the arduous path of study, argument
and inference is not for these favoured souls. They can enter into a
realization of the truth as easily as do children into a realization of this
world of sense.
But it may be that those who pay m.ost for truth do most appreciate
it when obtained, and also make the best use of it.
Such would be the convinced scientists, the philosophers, the biologists
and the physicists. Something new would be added to that which they
know, something shedding light on dark problems, opening out a new
path of understanding.
Between body and the Self, there would be recognized an intermediary
which translates sense vibrations on the brain into perceptions by the
173] A Neiv Hypothesis concerning Trans-Communications 163
Self ; a body whose form was the mould, or scaffolding, upon which the
growing physical form was built up to maturity.
The hypothesis put forward in this article, namely, the real but non-
physical body of Communicators, seems to me a decided advance upon
the current ideas about materialization. Readers will be familiar with the
work of Baron von Schrenck Notzing and others on that subject ; the
general conception being that the materializing mediums supply from
their own body the sheath, or covering, which protects the emanation,
and that this combination (called ectoplasm) is built up into the form of a
human body, in whole or part ;
that, in the best instances, this temporary
body can be somehow indwelt by a discarnate, even to the degree of
making speech and movement possible.
Similarly in regard to Direct Voice seances, the general idea is that the
ectoplasm provided by the physical medium is built up into temporary
voice organs which the discarnate can use for speech.
In both cases it is surmised that, without these temporary loans from
the medium, a discarnate is devoid of a body, or at least of anything
corresponding to our idea of bodily substance.
It has always been a strain on the imagination to suppose that vocal
organs could act on air without lungs, or that lungs and vocal organs
could be supported on nothing during their brief activities in the seance
room. On my hypothesis the vocal organs and the complete body are
already in existence, the Communicator comes to us in that body—his
other-world body—and has but to make use of such conditions as the
seance room offers. He can, for materialization, clothe or impregnate his
body with the ectoplasm ;
v/hile, for Direct Voice, he simply speaks and
relies on the vibration produced in the psychic emanation to effect a
secondary vibration in the air, so making his speech audible.
This hypothesis considerably simplifies the previous conjectures and,
to that extent, makes credence more easy and intelligent.
If, then, my hypothesis should prove true to fact, we have a means of
studying, in some small degree, that bodily form which will be our only
one when at death we leave flesh and blood behind. And, furthermore,
we have means of investigating the extent of its functions here and now as
an intermediary between the essential Self and this physical body which
for the time being we inhabit.
SOME EXPERIMENTS IN WILLED DIE-THROWING
By J. Eraser Nicol and Whately Carington
Introduction (W. W. C.)
Some time in the course of the year 1934, or thereabouts, I was informed
privately by Dr Rhine of the remarkable results he had been obtaining in
what is now commonly known as Psychokinesis (PK), notably as regards
attempts to influence the fall of a die by merely " willing " which face
should come uppermost. It seemed to me important that these experi-
ments should be repeated, and their outcome confirmed, if possible ; but
contemporary circumstances prevented my undertaking the necessary
work myself. I accordingly wrote to Mr Eraser Nicol, of Edinburgh, who
had already performed a large number of experiments of this kind in
connection with my experiments in Precognitive Guessing.^ In the
course of the next three years, or thereabouts, Mr Nicol carried out a great
deal of work on these lines, involving a total of more than 139,000 throws.
The results obtained were highly suggestive of a positive effect ; but it
was felt that they were not strong enough, where a phenomenon of so
novel and startling a character was concerned, to warrant publication in the
absence of supporting evidence, especially as the most important effect
(p. 172 below) was not discovered till quite recently. Moreover, Dr Rhine
did not begin to publish his own results until March 1943, and it might
well have been deemed improper for us to have published our lesser
contribution, even with due acknowledgments, before he felt that his
much greater one was ready to be presented. The whole matter was
accordingly put into cold storage, and until very recently no more than
relatively superficial assessments of the results were attempted.
With the publication of Dr Rhine's results, however, it has seemed
worth while to re-examine the data somewhat more thoroughly, and an
account of the course of the experiments and their outcome is presented
below. It is not claimed that the results obtained amount to anything
approaching coercive demonstration of the phenomena, but it is felt that
they constitute useful collateral evidence tending to support Dr Rhine's
main conclusion.
PART I. ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS (J. F. N.)
These attempts at willed die-throwing began on 7th October, 1934 ; the
bulk of the work was carried through in two years, and the whole series
came to a conclusion on 15th August, 1938. In all there were 227 experi-
ments or " runs ". With only some half-dozen exceptions a run comprised
either 120 or 2400 throws. The total number of throws was 139,396. Of
this total, 133,756 throws were witnessed and 5,640 were unwitnessed.
Only one die was used in each experiment (in Group 2 two dice were
^Journal S.P.R., Nos. 516 and 521, Vol. XXIX.
164
[Part 173] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwiitg . 165
brought intQ action, but only one of these had any direct relationship to
the PK side of the work).
From start to finish the shaking and throwing were done by hand,
without the use of mechanical contrivances. The same leather shaker
was used throughout. Its internal measurements were : height 7-8 cms.,
diameter of base 4 cms., diameter of mouth 4-5 cms.
The shaking and throwing were conducted in the most straightforward
fashion. All those who so unsparingly gave their time and patience to the
work were well known to me, but even so a watch was kept for develop-
ments of " tricky throwing " and nothing of the kind was ever observed.
It was a rule that the die must be shaken in the box at least once ; in
practice several quick shakes were generally made. The die was dis-
charged on to a table and might roll any distance up to several feet. A die
falling dead from the box
—
i.e. without rolling on the table—was dis-
allowed, but this was a very rare occurrence. On occasions when the die
fell to the floor the throw was recorded if the die came to a standstill in a
level position and ignored if it were tilted, e.g. against the edge of a carpet
or the angle of a wall.
It was also a rule that the die must get an unobstructed passage from the
box to the table without intermediately touching the thrower's fingers.
The throws were recorded in ink on suitably ruled sheets of foolscap
paper.
The experiments may conveniently be subdivided into four groups.
Group I was not designed as an example of PK—in fact psychokinesis
had not then been heard of on this side of the Atlantic, at any rate not by
the present writer. It was planned as a new approach to the problem of
precognitive guessing. My own efforts in that particular field were so
feeble that it occurred to me—in an ironic hour—that a die might be a
more successful prophet than myself. An experiment was therefore con-
ducted on the following lines.
A die, afterwards known as the " selector " die, was thrown and the
result recorded. A second, " working ", die was then thrown and the
result entered opposite the previous one. If the two figures coincided it
was supposed that precognition was at work (subject of course to statistical
assessment).
The notion that one die may precognise the fall of another die is doubt-
less as improbable an hypothesis as any thus far proposed in psychical
research. The raw data were laid aside, and it was only at a much later
date that a less repellent hypothesis suggested itself. This hypothesis may
best be stated in the form of a question : Having seen the face shown by
the selector die, was it possible that—unconsciously or otherwise—I then
tried or willed to throw the same face with the working die? If such were
the true course of events then the result, if statistically significant, would
be a successful experiment in psychokinesis.
Group 2 comprises a series of 1 14 runs carried through between January
and December 1935. Twelve persons took part, most of them performing
at least seven runs of 120 throws each (see Table i). In his first run the
subject tried to throw I's, in his second' to throw 2's, and so on to the
completion of the sequence with experiment six. It will be seen, therefore,
that there was no liberty of choice. However, at the conclusion of this
i66 J. Fraser Nicol and Whately Carington [Part
rouline he had one extra run, trying to throw a face-number decided upon
by himself. Plainly, these chosen-face trials, if the results proved
significant, could more simply be interpreted as successful precognition,
rather than as psychokinesis. There is no need to call in a PK hypothesis
when a presumably simpler one will amply explain any non-chance results.
All jf this work was witnessed except for a second, extra, routine set of
my o^vn.
When the throwing in this group had proceeded for some time, with a
die known as " Die 2 ", it became evident that the poorest scores were
returned when the target was face 3. The final data for this die (see
Table 4) show that it was, if anything, even more heavily biased against
4 than 3 ; but at the particular time in mind there was no question that 3
was the most difficult face to " will ". Because of the recalcitrance of
face 3—and for no other reason—I determined to try' to subject that face
to a prolonged session of willing. It will therefore be clear that such an
experiment was not a chosen-face experiment in the sense previously
indicated.
It happened that on the night of this session no witnesses were available.
The box and die were shaken with the left hand and the results entered
with the right. The duration of the session was not fixed beforehand,
and only the time on the clock (an early hour of the morning) brought the
session to a compulsory close.
The score for these 3's will be shown in Section 2 to be highly signi-
ficant. The whole affair is, of course, open to criticism, and this I think
may follow two lines.
(1) That the throwing was prematurely stopped at a point where the
score happened to reach a satisfactory stage of significance, but that if the
session had continued longer the high scoring would have faded out and
no significant result would have emerged. My own impression was, and is,
that if PK be a genuine phenomenon its manifestation is probably spas-
modic and variable (cf. Rhine's decline effect or certain variations
discussed in Section 2 of this paper). To dismiss the present result as due
to " premature stopping " may only blind us to the sort of thing that is
going on.
(2) That the throwing and recording were unwitnessed and are hence
undeserving of serious consideration. This is the objection which I would
make against other experimenters finding themselves in the same plight, and
I can hardly complain if the same criticism is directed against me—even
though I have the fullest confidence that the results are substantially correct.
Several other efforts were made to throw other faces, on the same lines
and for much the same reasons as those already given. Most of the throws
were unwitnessed and the results were unimpressive. These were,
however, recorded and have been included below.
Group 3 consisted of attempts by Mr Gordon L. N. Hadden and J. F. N.
to throw specified faces with a Crown and Anchor die.
Group 4. Experience derived from Groups i to 3 seemed to point to
the conclusion that high scoring was most likely to be attained if each
session were continued over a rather long period, say an hour or two ; and
especially so if the throwing were carried out at a fairly high speed.
Accordingly, Group 4 was conducted on the following lines:
173] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwing 167
Each run comprised 2,400 throws. At his first session the subject aimed
at face i, at his second at face 2, and so on up to the 6th and last session
when the target-face was 6. Each person therefore made 2400 x 6 = 14,400
throv.'s. As eight subjects took part the total number of throws was
115,200.
From a technical point of view this group forms the most satisfactory
section of the whole series. The conditions were tightened up and made
uniform as far as possible. Thus the same die—Die 3 —was used through-
out ;
length of side 9 mm., weight 1-50 gm. The same dice-box was
employed for all throws. The die being small and the box relatively large
there could be no doubt about the thorough disturbance of the die when
shaken. On all occasions the die was ejected on to a special piece of green
baize stretched across whichever table was in use. All throws were wit-
nessed.
A serious mishap broke into the throwing at an early stage. "
At the
2930th throw the die—Die 2—bounced from the table across the room
and into a blazing fire. Consequently a fresh start had to be made, this
time with Die 3, details of which have been given in the preceding para-
graph. Thereafter events proceeded smoothly.
PART II. ASSESSMENT (W. W. C.)
The data collected have been examined with some approach to exhaustive-
ness ;
but, since most of the results have been null, there is nothing to be
gained by going into details here. It will be seen, however, that there are
two major effects, and one of these in the large block of witnessed throws
forming Group 4, which strongly indicate the operation of a genuine
PK effect.
It will be convenient not to take the four groups of throws in their
chronological order, but to dispose first of the small contributions from
I and 3 before dealing with the more important 2 and 4.

Group I, as explained in Part I, was not strictly a PK experiment at all,
in the sense that it was not intended as such ; but it is relevant because
any significant result would involve supposing that PK factors were
operative, even if precognition of how the second die was about to fall
were assumed.
The work consisted of 1200 double throws, i.e. 1200 of the " selector
"
die and 1200 of the " working die ", so to call them. The results are
shown in Table 2.

That is to say, the selector die showed i on 184 occasions, and on 37 of
these the working die also showed i, each of these 37 constituting a
success or " hit " ; the working die similarly showed 2 on 40 of the 210
occasions when the selector die shov/ed 2 ; and so on. And the working
die showed i on 195 occasions, 2 on 190 occasions, etc.
There are 223 hits (and 977 failures) altogether against an a priori
expectation of 200 hits and 1000 failures. This gives X- as 3 '174 and P
slightly less than -08, which is not significant.
But it is evident by inspection that the selector die was heavily biassed in
favour of face 6, and the working die slightly so. To allow for this we do
not use the a priori expectation of one-sixth the total number of trials,
but calculate the sum of the products of corresponding marginal totals
(195 X 184 + 190 X 210 . . . etc.) and divide by 1200. This gives a true
expectation of 200-7 successes and 999-3 failures. Note that this calculated
expectation would necessarily agree with the a priori value if the thrower
made equal numbers of attempts (viz. 200 here) at each of the six faces,
instead of a number dependent on the vagaries of the selector die.
But the bias of the dice also affects the variance ; so that, to obtain an
accurate result, we make use of Stevens' method (Proc. S.P.R., Part 162,
p. 132) and calculate this quantity as 168-874. This, in conjunction with
the true expectation of 200-7 successes, gives as 3-051 and P very nearly
-08. The difference is trivial, but the procedure is one which must be
applied in all doubtful cases, since dice can never be safely assumed to be
unbiassed.
The result is some way from significance ; but the odds are about 1 1 to i
against obtaining this number of successes, or more, by chance alone,
which is perhaps more promising than one would expect. The technique
seems one which might be worth further development.
I 73] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwing 169
Group 3 may be dismissed with even greater brevity. A total of 2067
throws was made by two subjects using a " Crown and Anchor " die.
Of these 338 were successful against an a priori expectation of 344-5.
The deficiency is not significant, giving X'^ -125 with P -72. But the die
was heavily biassed, and more exact treatment gives an excess of 11-4
hits above true expectation, with .Y^ -432 and P -52. There is no suggestion,
however, that any PK factor is at work.
Group 2 is much larger and very mixed. It consists, first, of 14,280
throws, of which 8,640 were witnessed and 5,640 were not, by 1 1 subjects
using the die known as " Die 2 ". Of the witnessed throws there are
six completed sets of routine work, in which the subject made 120 throws
at each of the six faces in turn, one half-finished set, making 4,680 throws,
and 33 runs of 120 throws each in which the subject was trying for some
face chosen by himself, viz. 3,960 throws. The unwitnessed material, all
by J. F. N., comprises two long series of 22 and 15 runs trying for faces
3 and 5 respectively, 4 runs trying for face i, and one set of routine work.
Total 47 runs, or 5,640 throws.
Then, with Die 4, there is a routine set and a chosen face run from each
of four subjects, and a half set from another, making 28 runs or 3,360
throws. All these were witnessed. There is also half a witnessed routine
set with Die 3.
Finally, I have included in this Group a total of 2,929 throws with Die 2,
which were originally intended to be part of the big block of 115,200
throws known as Group 4, but were interrupted by accidental destruction
of the die, as explained in Part I.
The total for this Group is accordingly 20,929 throws. These may
conveniently be summarized in tabular form as under :

Total 20,929
In this table R stands for routine work and C for chosen face trials.
Since the results of chosen face trials, even if positive and significant,
might be attributed to the subject having precognised a face about to
appear with above chance frequency (as J. F. N. points out), we may set
all these aside for the mom^ent and begin by examining the witnessed
routine throws with Die 2. The full data are given in Table 4.
It will be understood that the first three lines include the three runs of
the half set mentioned above, and the top line also the 2,929 throv/s
intended as the beginning of the big block of Group 4, but interrupted as
explained.
The leading diagonal shows a total of 1,328 hits against an exact expecta-
tion, calculated from the marginal totals, of 1274-7, showing an excess of
53-3. The value of X'^ is 2-68 with P about -i, which is not significant,
lyo J. Eraser Nicol and Whately Carington f [Part
though not unpromising. The values of the expectations for the six cells
are 635-5, 159-0, 125-0, 106-2, 127-6 and 121-5. It is noteworthy that the
observed number of hits exceeds the expected value in all six cases. The
probability of this occurring by chance is 1/2^ or i in 64 ; but this must
be doubled as the same would be true if all six observed values were less
than expectation. Still, a value of P so small as -03 is by no means to be
disregarded.
To the total excess of 53-3, the six complete routine sets contribute
29 points (749 hits against an expectation of 720), and the " oddments ",
therefore, 24-3 points.

No individual subject in this batch gives a significant result ; the best
value of is about 3-24 with P -07, and the second best is 2-88 with
P about -09. The sum of X"s for all nine subjects is 8-21 with nine d.f.,
which is quite negligible.
The three witnessed routine runs with Die 3 show 58 hits ; the expecta-
tion, calculated as one-third of the total observed frequency of the three
faces (4, 5, 6) tried for, is 56-7, so that the subject just, though negligibly,
gives a positive result.
The four witnessed routine sets with Die 4 show a total excess of 10 hits
over the exact expectation of 480, which is negligible, while no subject
comes anywhere near attaining significance. On the other hand, one
subject (J. A. S. W.) scores so high as 35 in one of his runs of 120, against
an exact expectation of 21-82, giving A"- as 12-915 and P less than -ooi.
But this is not maintained (he scores two points below expectation for his
whole set) and can hardly be taken as definitely significant in the context
of the whole group, though very v/ell worth noting. Perhaps we might
accord it a value of about -02 as the best of 24 runs forming this subsection
of the data.
Considering next the chosen-face trials, which, as already observed, are
of lesser importance, we find that the 33 runs with Die 2 show an excess of
37 hits above the expectation of 660, using the a priori value which will
make no appreciable diff^erence here ; this gives A'^ as 2-498 with P about
•12. No subject is at all outstanding, but J. F. N. scores 187 hits in his
first batch of eight runs against an exact expectation of 165-6, giving
as 3 -34 and P about -07, which is mildly promising and of some interest in
view of his later performance. The four chosen-face runs by the four
173] Some Experiments in Willed Die- Throwing 171
subjects with Die 4 are of little interest, for they only succeed in scoring a
total of six points below a priori expectation.
When we turn to the unwitnessed material by J. F. N. working alone
we find results of considerably greater interest. The first item, chrono-
logically, is a set of six routine runs, and in no way noteworthy, for the
score is only five points above expectation.
But in his first attempt at concentrating on a single face (3), selected
because the die seemed (and was) biassed against it, J. F. N. scores no
fewer than 493 successes in 22 runs (2,640 throws). The exact expectation
is 415-89, calculated from all the Die 2 data, so that the excess is 77'ii,
giving a value for A'- of 16-75 with P somewhat better than -oooi or one
in ten thousand.
The distribution of successes within the runs is also remarkablfe. The
scores in order are
19, 17, 18, 18, 22, 20, 25, 18, 24, 16, 25,
14. / 34> 25, 22, 29, 29, 27, 23, 21, 22, 25.
The first twelve runs (up to the dividing mark /) are uneventful and show
only a score of 236 against an expectation of about 227, whereas the last ten
are all above expectation and show a total of 257 against expectation of about
189. If we arbitrarily divide the series into halves and compare the first
with the second, we find A'- as 5-75 with P less than -02. Note that all
22 runs were done at a single session.
It is, of course, exceedingly unfortunate that this series of trials was
unwitnessed, and anyone is entitled, if he insists, to disregard it altogether
on this account. But it seems difficult to understand why, if J. F. N.'s
subconscious suddenly elected to make him cheat, or discovered how to do
so, it should not have kept it up in his subsequent attempts, also unwit-
nessed, under substantially the same conditions. These consisted of 15
runs (1,800 throws), also in a single session, aimed at face 5, which gave
only 323 hits for an exact expectation of 316-7, the excess of 6-3 being
negligible ; and four runs trying for face i, which yielded only 67 hits
against exact expectaton of 78-4, which is also of no interest.
Note also that the successes in the big session for threes cannot plausibly
be attributed to precognition, because the face was chosen on the express
ground that three was one of the least likely faces to be thrown.
It is believed that, despite their being unwitnessed, these runs may safely
be accepted as having considerable evidential value.
Group 4, consisting of 115,200 throws made by eight subjects, each of
whom made 2,400 throws in trying for each face of the die, is, in a way,
the piece de resistance of the work, and accordingly deserves especially
careful study ; but its compact form enables us to deal with it a good deal
more easily than the group just considered.
The total score in the leading diagonal amounts to 19,291 hits, while the
exact expectation is, of course, 19,200. The difference of 91, though
positive, is very far from significance. Its variance, calculated by Stevens'
method is' 15,954-07 with standard error of 126-305, giving a normal
deviate of only -720 with P no better than about -47. Subjects clearly do
not, in general, succeed in throwing the faces they desire to any non-
chance extent.

But, logically speaking, the more fundamental question is whether
throws are wholly independent of intention, as they should be if chance
factors alone are operative ; for it might well be that subjects, exerting
some kind of influence over the fall of the die, but unable, through ignor-
ance, etc. properly to control it, might produce results other than those
intended.
To investigate this we apply the ordinary test of independence for a
contingency table, calculating the values of -Y- for each of the 36 cells and
summing to obtain a A'' with 25 d.f. This comes to 38-371, with P
somewhat better than -05. We may conclude with fair assurance that the
face thrown is not independent of the intention of the thrower, even
though that intention is not directly realized.
The principal way in which this non-independence shows itself becomes
clear, if we tabulate the deviations from expectation for each cell separately,
as in Table 6.

The deviations, of differing signs and magnitudes, are for the most part
scattered erratically about the table ; but there is one feature that at once
strikes the eye, namely the fact that, in the leading diagonal, all three
deviations for the low valued faces, i,.2 and 3 are negative, and all those
for the high faces, 4, 5 and 6 are positive. The total for the low faces is
-123-00 with mean -41-00, and for the high faces 214-00 with mean
71-33. The difl^erence between the totals is 337-00 and between the means
is 112-33.
173] Some Experiments in Willed Die-Throwing 173
Now, it has recently been shown by Stevens (unpubhshed result) that
the variance of any linear function
C = ^iCi + ^2*^2 + h^z + • • • k^Cn
of the leading entries, q, c^, . . . c„ of an n x n Contingency Table is
given by
Variance (C) = jiVf^ + N {Ekm) - Skhn [a
+»|
where mj=ajbj/N ; M= k^m-^^+k.2m^+ . . . k„m.^ ;
a^, a^, . . . a„,
^2> ^3 . . . b„ are the row and column totals ; and N the grand total.
To test the significance of the ditference between the High and Low
scores, we take = ^2 = ^3 = " ^ '^^^ k^ = k-=kg = i and from the data of
Table 5 find the variance to be 12,754-82 with standard error 112-935.
Since the differenee, as noted above, is 337, this gives D/s = 2-984, with
P=*oo27, which is highly significant. It would remain significant at
•027, even if we were to multiply by 6 1/2-3 '3 '
= 1°' which is the number of
ways in which it is possible to divide six entries into two groups of three
each ; but of these the only two sharp and natural divisions seem to be
into High and Low and Odd and Even, so that to multiply by 4 would
appear to meet all reasonable requirements.
There seems no doubt that this is a genuine eff'ect, and it is not so
recondite or so " senseless ", if I may put it so, that it can be dismissed as
just one of those significant features which one is bound to find sooner or
later, if only one examines enough of them. It is not, so to say, a first
order effect—the total overall score, which was the prime object of the
work, is unique in that—but it is a very good second order one ; for the
question whether subjects do better with some faces than with others is
one of the most obvious to ask. And it is not particularly far-fetched to
suppose that some such factor as a subconscious antipathy to low values
might reverse the PK influence, and thus cause it to cancel out the positive
result obtained when trying for high faces.
The effect appears to be general rather than confined to a few subjects
only, as is shown by the contributions made to the deviations for low and
high faces by individual subjects, as shown in Table 7.

(The minor discrepancies between these and previous figures are,
of course, due to the arithmetical approximations used.)
174 J. Fraser Nicol and Whately Carington [Part
It will be seen that six subjects out of eight score below expectation
when trying for low faces, while the same proportion score high when
trying for high faces.
If we square and sum the totals for the different subjects (using the
whole number values) and subtract 91-/8 = 1035-125, we obtain 16,491-875
as the sum of squares of deviations from the mean. Dividing this by the
theoretical variance per subject (14,400 throws) of 2000, which is accurate
enough for this purpose, we obtain 8-246 as a X~ with 7 d.f. representing
the extent to which subjects differ between themselves. This is negligible
with P about -3, from which we conclude that these subjects do not differ
sufficiently between themselves in their over-all performance, for the
difference to be shown significant in this number of trials. Corresponding
values of for the Low and High figures separately are, respectively,
6-566 with P about -5 and 7-809 with P about -4. This confirms the
conclusion reached by inspection that subjects do not differ except by
chance in the contributions they make to either the low or high halves of
the leading diagonal.
Subjects equally show no individual preferences for throwing certain

Applying the ordinary contingency table technique, we obtain 42-33
as the value of A- with 35 d.f. This is quite insignificant, with P about

A considerable further amount of work has been done, mainly by
J. F. N., in counting scores by pages, runs of 120, columns of 30, rows of
24, etc., with a view to detecting regressions, other abnormalities of
distribution, and so forth ; and I myself have pursued a stage or two
further the process of analysing the data of the block. But all results
have been null, and there is nothing to be gained by going into details
here. Besides, one would in any event be naturally and properly some-
what suspicious of results not admitting of relatively straightforward
interpretation, and obtained only by elaborate squeezings of the material,
if they were not supported by others of a simpler type.
We may, however, notice the absence of any Quarter Page effect of the
kind discovered by Rhine. The distribution of hits in the four quarters

The value of X"^ is -259 with P about -51, which is quite insignificant ;
and so is the sum of the corresponding XH for the eight subjects taken
separately, which comes to 6-oio with 8 d.f. and P about -6. The method
is only rough, but sufficient in the circumstances.
When we attempt to assess the work as a whole, I think we should,
as a matter of strictness, set aside the chosen face trials for the reasons
already given, and regard J. F. N.'s remarkable performance in throwing
threes as in the nature of collateral though strong suppbrting evidence.
Restricting ourselves thus to the witnessed routine trials, there are three
main features which seem to me to be worth noting.
First, there is the fact that of the six main divisions of the work
—
viz.
Two Dice, Crown and Anchor Die, Six complete sets with Die 2, Odd-
ments with Die 2, Four complete sets with Die 4, and the Block of 1 15,200
throws just considered, all show a positive result. So, indeed, does the
half set with Die 3, but this is so small and the result so feeble that it seems
hardly decent to count it. The probability of obtaining six positive results
is only i in 32, as already noted.
Second, there is the similar fact that all six cells of the leading diagonal
of Table 4 show positive deviations.
And, third, there is the curious but quite significant contrast between
the low and high scores for the big Block of Group 4. I admit that I
should feel happier about this if I could think of some plausible and straight-
forward explanation of it ; but perhaps this would be too much to hope
for in the present state of our ignorance, and I think there can be no doubt
that the effect is perfectly genuine.
No doubt it would be possible, though not very easy, to devise some
plan for combining these three probabilities with due regard to the
discounting appropriate to the contexts in which they occur ; but I think
that this would be definitely artificial, and very possibly misleading.
From the common-sense point of view—and common sense has a place
even in statistical work, current beliefs and practices notwithstanding—
I
think a reasonable conclusion is this : That if this work stood alone, it
would not be sufficient to warrant the acceptance of so revolutionary an
hypothesis as that of psychokinesis ; but that, in the light of the work
reported by Rhine (and on a smaller scale by others) it may be regarded as
highly probable that J. F. N.'s subjects were in fact exerting, sometimes
and in relatively low degree, some sort of influence on the fall of the die,
though this influence was erratic and uncontrolled, so that it did not in
general produce quite the effects desired.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE
SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
PART 174
THE PSI PROCESSES IN NORMAL AND " PARANORMAL "
PSYCHOLOGY
R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner
It is perhaps desirable that we should begin by trying to make clear the
object of the present paper. Thinking about the accumulated results of
psychical research is rather like playing with the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle.
There is a great deal there but it does not seem to fit together ; still less do
the bits seem to fit into the already largely completed pattern of scientific
psychology, physiology, etc. spread out on the table beside it. That the
facts of psychical research are really odd bits which do not fit in anywhere
is possible, but it is a possibility which we are unwilling to accept until we
are forced to. So we must try to make a pattern of them somehow. If two
or three pieces seem to belong together we must fit them together and see
how it goes. There is nothing final about this ; a promising start may turn
out wrong and the bits must be torn apart again. Nor must we regard as
final the patterns of the part of the jig-saw already on the table ; failure to
fit our pieces in may be, due to mistakes in the already completed part of the
pattern ; we must be ready to consider the possibility also that this may
need altering.
We may succeed in fitting some bits together without seeing how the
resulting groups themselves fit together. We may have managed to get
right in some parts and wrong in others. It would have been better and
more satisfactory to have been able to present a complete and perfect
pattern without inconsistencies or untidy edges, but this may have to be
left to our grandchildren. In the meantime, we must be content if we can
fit some bits together and get some indication of what kind of pattern it is.
That is the object of the present paper. We have made some hypotheses
which seem to us to fit together some of the facts of psychical research and
which also seem to make it possible to fit them into the pattern of the more
orthodox sciences of psychology and physiology although not without
some change in the existing pattern of these. We make no claim to have
proved the truth of the hypotheses we have put forward ; rather we have
tried to suggest grounds for supposing that they are not altogether wrong.
It seems to us that we have some inkling of the kind of shape the pattern is
going to take. We may not succeed in expressing this sufficiently clearly
to create conviction or even understanding. We may be wrong ; whether
or not this is so will be known by the extent to which our suggestions prove
fruitful for future research and for future advances in theoretical under-
standing. If our hypotheses are unfruitful they will be forgotten. It will
M 177
178 R. H. Thoidess and B. P. IViesiicr [Part
still have been worth while to have made the attempt ; our failure may
help others to explore more profitable lines of advance.
The nature of our aim will, we hope, be sufficient explanation of why we
have considered aspects of psychical research other than those whose
reality is generally regarded as sufficiently established by laboratory ex-
periment. If the most rigid criteria of evidence are required before an
alleged fact in psychical research can be considered as unquestionably
established, there is no reason for requiring equal weight of evidence
before we can allow ourselves to consider how that alleged fact would fit
into the general pattern. In trying to fit our jig-saw together it is necessary
sometimes to try to fit. in bits which may not belong to the pattern at all.
So we have considered not only such respectable parapsychological facts
as " extra-sensory perception " and " psycho-kinesis " but also materialisa-
tions and faith healing. Clearly it would be of no interest to consider such
things unless there were considerable grounds for believing in their
genuineness, but it would be absurd to refuse to consider them because
not all psychical researchers are yet convinced of their reality.
Let us begin by considering in the most general terms the facts referred
to by such terms as " extra-sensory perception ", " paranormal cognition ",
" precognition ", etc. Normal perception can be expressed behaviouristi-
cally {i.e. in terms of what can be observed by an outside observer) by say-
ing that an organism makes some response which is adapted to some feature
of the external environment, this adaptation being produced by a process
in the organism's sensory nervous system initiated by some stimulus from
the environment. E.S.P. can be similarly expressed as the fact that an
organism makes some reponse which is adapted to some feature of the ex-
ternal environment although there has been no sensory process in the
organism initiated by a stimulus from that feature of the environment. If
the organism in question is that of a human being, we may supplement this
behaviouristic knowledge and discover whether or not he was aware of that
feature in the environment to which his behaviour showed adaptation. We
find generally but not always that his adaptation of behaviour to environ-
mental situation was accompanied by awareness in normal perception, and
generally but not always that it was not so accompanied in extra-sensory
perception. In both cases, the fact of correspondence between behaviour
and environment may be regarded as the essential one ; awareness of the
feature of the environment causing the adaptation of behaviour as an un-
essential one. In ordinary speech, we might express the fact that the be-
haviour of an organism showed adaptation to certain features of its en-
vironment by saying that it behaved "as if it were aware " of those
elements of its environment. The fact of the organism behaving as if it
knew a certain range of facts about the environment can be expressed by
saying that that part of the environment is " projected " on to the be-
havioural system of the organism. [2] The sum total of these projections
at any one time is what Koffka has called the " behavioural environment
"
of the organism [20].
In such an experiment as card guessing, what is observed is the fact of
correspondence between environment and reaction. We find, for example,
that the subject says " cross " when the cross turns up, that is, a piece of
his behaviour appears to be determined by a fact of the external world.
174] The Psi Processes in Xormul and " Paranormal " Psychology 179
We do not necessarily or even commonly also find that he is aware of that
projected fact ; he generally does not know whether he gives a correct
response or not. It is, therefore somewhat misleading to use such a term
as " paranormal cognition ", since " cognition " would seem to imply
more than mere correspondence between behaviour and fact. It implies
also an awareness of the fact, and such awareness may or may not be present.
In order to avoid the misleading implications of such terms, we have
preferred to adopt the symbol T (psi) which, to begin with, has no im-
plications except that all that it is used to cover are supposed to be pro-
cesses not essentially different from one another. The term W was
originally used by us to cover such processes as telepathy, clairvoyance,
precognition, etc. One reason for adopting this single symbol for a number
of processes that had previously been known by different names was to
suggest that these were not essentially different processes only united by
the fact that they were " paranormal " (i.e. inexplicable on current theories
of the psychology of cognition) but that they might be different aspects of a
single process in which the organism was guided by environmental events
not known by ordinary perceptual processes. The different names for
" paranormal " cognitive processes were regarded by us not as indicating
essentially different processes but as distinguishing different situations in
which the one process might be manifested
—
e.g. presence or absence of
knowledge in some other person's mind of what is cognised, and present
or future happening of the event cognised. After the publication of the
North Carolina work on psycho-kinesis [i] we extended our use of the
term W to include this also and we distinguished the motor aspect of !F
(P.K.) from its cognitive aspect (E.S.P.) [2]. This extension, of course,
also implies the hypothesis that P.K. and E.S.P. may not be essentially
different processes but different aspects of one process. Professor Rhine
has now expressed acceptance of this hypothesis [14].
It seems convenient to make a further modification in this terminology
which will both bring E.S.P. and P.K. under one generic term and also
distinguish them as different kinds of process of the same general class.
We, therefore, propose to use the symbol (psi-gamma) for the cognitive
psi process (extra-sensory perception or paranormal cognition) and Wk
(psi-kappa) for the motor psi process (or psycho-kinesis).
Both IFy and are generally regarded as abnormal processes found to
a marked extent in only a few people and perhaps to a negligibly small ex-
tent in a larger number of people. This is obviously true of E.S.P. and
P.K. We wish to suggest, however, that these are merely unusual forms of
processes which are themselves usual and commonplace, and that in their
usual and commonplace form, they are to be found as elements in the nor-
mal processes of perception and motor activity.
In normal sensory perception, there is complete material causal con-
tinuity from the light waves or other form of energy passing from the
object to the sense-organ of the organism, through the physical and
chemical processes m the sense-organ and the electro-chemical field
processes of the conducting system of neurons, to the resulting excitation
in the sensory part of the cerebral cortex. But here there is something
which appears to be other than a new link in a chain of material events :
the production by a material process in the cerebral cortex of a conscious
i8o ' R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part
mental event. The same situation arises on the motor side where material
causal continuity is complete except for the translation of the conscious
mental event of volition into the material changes in the motor area of the
cerebral cortex which are the material cause of a willed action.
The hypothesis we wish to suggest is that, i7i normal thinking and per-
ceiving I am in the same sort of relation to what is going on in the sensory part
of my brain and nervous system as that of the successful clairvoyant to some
external event, and that this relation is established by the same means {i.e.
by "Fy).
It would be simpler but obviously incorrect to try to express this by
saying :
" In ordinary thinking and perceiving, I know what is going on
in my brain and nervous system by the same means as that by which the
successful clairvoyant knows some external event." This will not do be-
cause in ordinary thinking and perceiving, I obviously do not know what
is going on in my brain and nervous system. When I perceive an external
event,-I do not perceive any physico-chemical processes that may be taking
place in my brain. Yet these form one of the causal links in the total pro-
cess of perception ; in the linked chain of causes between the external
event and the perception of that event, the physico-chemical processes of
the brain are generally considered to be the immediate causal ancestors of
the mental event of perception.
That the relation between me and the physico-chemical processes in my
brain is not that of knowing may appear at first sight to be a difi^erence
between this relation and that of the successful clairvoyant to the external
event since we are inclined to say that the clairvoyant knows the external
event. This, however, is to allow oneself to be misled by the implications
of the commonly used term " paranormal cognition ". What we discover
in a successful experiment in clairvoyance is, as has already been pointed
out, not that the clairvoyant knows an external event but that some verbal
or other behaviour response of his corresponds to the external event. He
is, for example, guessing through a Zener pack. When the card turned up is
a rectangle, he says " rectangle " or points to the pile of cards with a rect-
angle displayed above it. In spontaneous cases also, the immediately
observable fact is a correspondence between his behaviour and some ex-
ternal event. The external event seems to be a causal ancestor of his re-
action without the usual intermediate links of stimulus and stimulation of
the sense organ. Whether it is the immediate causal ancestor of the re-
sponse or whether there is here too a projection of the external event on
the sensory parts of the brain, is a question on which we cannot, of course,
have any direct evidence. We are assuming that there is no such brain
process in clairvoyance and* that the relation of the percipient to the ex-
ternal event is the same as that of the percipient to his brain processes in
normal (sensory) perception.
We are hampered in the attempt to express this idea clearly by the fact
that we have no word in ordinary speech to express the relation between
me and my brain processes in normal perception. We have the word
" cognition " for the relation between me and the external event, but it
would obviously be an error to use this word for the relation between me
and the corresponding brain processes. Let us then call this the y relation.
Since it is not always convenient to use a technical vocabulary, we can ex-
174] The Psi Processes in Normal and " Paranormal " Psychology 181
press the same idea in more ordinary speech by saying that in ordinary
perception I am informed of the external event by the perceptual brain
processes.
We suggest also that there is a similar identity of relation in normal
motor control of the body on the one hand and the " paranormal " process
of psycho-kinesis on the other. Our second hypothesis is : / control the
activity of my nervous system [and so indirectly control such activities as the
movements of my body and the course of yny thinking) by the same means as
that by which the successful psycho-kinetic subject controls the fall of the dice
or other object [i.e. by Wk).
Here also we may note that, just as the activity of the nervous system is
not itself cognised in normal perception, so also in normal bodily activity
the brain processes leading to action are not themselves willed. We will
to move our arm, not to initiate the physico-chemical processes in the motor
area of the brain which start the arm movement. In this case no difficulty
is created for the verbal formulation of the hypothesis since the phrase " I
control " used of my relation to the activity of the nervous system is not
likely to be misunderstood as implying that these are directly the objects
of volition.
The experimental investigation of psycho-kinesis has so far been con-
fined to studying its effects on relatively large bodies and not on systems of
the order of size of a body cell. The primary reason for this limitation has
no doubt been the practical one of the great difficulty of eliminating dis-
turbing factors in studying effects on such small systems. If, however, the
effect exists, it is reasonable to suppose that the ideal mechanism for study-
ing it would be one in which very minute forces could start processes in
systems of small size, which processes could act as triggers for subsequent
processes involving sufficiently large forces to be easily observable. If
indeed a physicist could construct for us a mechanism in which there
were delicately balanced systems of very small size, which balance could
be upset by small forces yet was protected from being upset by small
forces accidentally impinging from outside, and if, moreover, any change in
th-ese small systems could be automatically magnified to a large energy
change in some larger system, then we might hope to have the ideal
mechanism for the experimental demonstration of psycho-kinesis. We
have not succeeded in devising such a mechanism for our laboratories.
We suggest that the brain is such a mechanism : that in its motor aspect
it is a mechanism perfected by evolution not only for distributing impulses
received from the sensory system but also for translating by Wk my in-
tentions and volitions into action.
We have so far used the term " I " in order to defer decision as to what
general term shall be used to cover " I ", " you " and " he " in the same
sense. Interactionists have very often spoken of the " mind " controlling
the body, but this word will not do for our purpose. The word " mind
"
is not now most generally used for that which thinks and decides but rather
for the whole system of thoughts, memories, decisions, etc. Moreover, the
common use of the phrases " my mind ", " your mind ", etc., implies that
the word mind is used in some other sense than that of " me " and " you ".
The second objection applies equally to " self " as the general term for the
" I " in the formulation of our hypothesis. The word which best expresses
l82 R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part
our meaning is undoubtedly " soul ", and our hypothesis could be ex-
pressed as that the soul is in cognitive relation with what goes on in the
sensory part of the nervous system by Wy and controls the motor part of
the nervous system by Wk.
The main objection to the use of " soul " in this connection is that this
term also has an already existing connotation and that some part of this
connotation may not be what is required for the present purpose. It
seems better, therefore, as in the case of W, to use a mere symbol whose
connotation will be supplied subsequently by the observed facts.
We have used the Greek alphabet to supply symbols for the processes
of parapsychology. Since, however, we are now dealing with something of
a different order, a postulated entity and not a process, it seems convenient
to mark this difference by using a symbol drawn from another alphabet,
and we suggest for this purpose the Hebrew letter ^ (Shin). The state-
ment, therefore, that Shin is in relation with the sensory part of the brain
and nervous system by means of Wy and that Shin controls by Wk the
motor part of the nervous system, is the generalised form of the suggestion
already made that I am in relation with the sensory part of my brain and
nervous system by means of Wy, etc.
What is suggested may be expressed in other words. We suppose that
what is unusual about extra-sensory perception and psycho-kinesis is not
Fig. I
that they are processes abnormal in themselves, but that they are exo-
somatic forms of processes which are normally endo-somatic.
174] The Psi Processes in Normal and " Paranorrnal " Psychology 183
The supposed relationship of perceptual awareness with clairvoyance
and of volition with psycho-kinesis can perhaps be made more clear by
means of a diagram (Fig. i). The upper circle represents JJ' i.e. Shin
(that which perceives and wills). The central oblong represents the ner-
vous system which is divided by a line in the middle into the motor part of
the nervous system (M.N.S.) and the sensory part of the nervous system
(S.N.S.). The circle below represents the external object which is being
perceived or acted upon. The object sends light waves or other sensory
stimuli which act on the sensory part of the nervous system. These are
represented by the right hand half of the area between Object and Nervous
System, while the left hand half of this area represents muscular action or
other physical means by which the organism acts on the object. The
areas which connect Shin with M.N.S. and S.N.S. represent respectively
the postulated normal processes of Wk and Wy by which we suppose Shin
to control the activity of the motor part of the nervous system and to be
informed by processes in the sensory part of the nervous system. The
parts of the and Wy areas which pass outside the area representing
the nervous system and directly connect the circles representing Shin and
the object, represent the postulated " paranormal " processes of psycho-
kinesis and extra-sensory perception by means of which we suppose that
direct relations are established between Shin and the object without the
intervention of the nervous system.
While the diagram shows (for the sake of simplicity) only the postulated
Shin activity of one individual, we do not mean to imply that, in an experi-
mental situation in which an experimental subject is showing successful
paranormal cognition or psycho-kinesis, the situation is adequately repre-
sented in such a simple manner. The experimenter may also be paranor-
mally cognising the object or influencing it by fk, and there may be tele-
pathic interaction in either or both directions between Shin and nervous
system of the kinds shown in later diagrams.
One reason for preferring to use the symbol ^ rather than the word
" soul " for that which is postulated to be in cognitive relationship with
the organism and in motor control of it, is in order that we may not, by our
choice of a name, prejudge any empirical questions which may later arise
in connection with it. We are trying not to imply any opinion as to whether
Shin ceases to exist at the time of death, whether if it survives death it is
or is not still associated with an organism of some kind, whether it is
peculiar to human organisms, whether it is simple or structured, change-
less or changeable, separate or part of a larger whole. These questions are,
no doubt, important and will go on being discussed. For us to express any
opinion on them now would be, from the point of view of the present paper,
an irrelevancy.
No doubt, the use of the term " Shin ", like the use of " psi " does also
imply a theory. As the use of " psi " implies that " telepathy ", " clair-
voyance ", " precognition ", etc. are all names for the same process occur-
ring in different situations, so the use of the term " Shin " implies the
rejection of the generally accepted view of the mind-body problem of the
orthodox biologist, psychologist, and physiologist. This is the view that
consciousness is " how the organism experiences the [i.e. its own] brain
happenings " [18]. Rejecting the idea of a conscious being as " a '
soul
'
I
R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part
imprisoned in a '
body ' " [i8] it regards a conscious being as " on the
contrary, a portion of the stuff of reahty organised so that it is intensely
conscious " [i8]. To all those who have been trained in the orthodox
schools of biological psychology and physiology, any kind of soul theory is
repugnant as a backward step in thought. It does not, however, appear
likely that the current orthodoxy of biological psychology and physiology
can assimilate the facts of psychical research without drastic reconstruction
of its mind-body theory. It seems, therefore, to be an adventure in thought
worth taking to discard our prejudice against soul theories and to consider
whether the adoption of a theory of this type may not be the step necessary
to make it possible to fit into the same theoretical framework the " normal
"
facts of scientific psychology and physiology and those " paranormal
"
facts which psychical research compels us to recognise.
The plausibility of the hypotheses we are suggesting depends in part on
the extent to which " paranormal " Wy and Wk resemble the normal inter-
action between Shin and nervous system in perception and motor activity
respectively. Let us first consider two characteristics of " paranormal
"
Wy processes—temporal displacement and symbolism—in which it appears
at first sight that they differ from the processes of normal perception.
It was found by Whately Carington [3] and subsequently confirmed by
Soal [4] that there may be a temporal displacement in extra-sensory per-
ception, commonly taking the form of reacting to a future event when a
present event is the one aimed at. There is also a feature of the y relation
of Shin with our nervous systems which may be considered to be of the
nature of temporal displacement. We are not merely in this relation with
what is happening now in our organisms but also with what has happened
and with what is about to happen. The displacement towards the future
is expressed by saying that we are aware not only of our present activities
but also of our " intentions ". The use of this word " intention ", how-
ever, with its implication of a present process, tends to make us overlook
the fact that what is known is a future event of the organism. In some cases
at any rate, the fact of intending may be more correctly expressed by saying
that Shin is in the Wy relationship not only with present events in the
organism but also with those of its near future. The 7 relation of Shin with
the processes of the nervous system may, therefore, resemble extra-sensory
perception in showing temporal displacement. It is also, of course,
possible that memory may not always be (as supposed in current psychology)
conditioned by present " traces " in the nervous system but may some-
times be a post-cognitive f relation with past states of the nervous system
or directly with past events themselves.
Another characteristic of Wy is that the cognition is not in general of the
characteristics of the object cognised (as these characteristics appear to
normal perception) but of something which is a substitute for this object,
that is, some symbol of it. This symbolic character of fy is obscured in
card guessing experiments as ordinarily performed, since the test of success
is exact correspondence between the guess and the object. In spontaneous
Wy phenomena however, symbolic representation is very common, e.g. in
dreams and when psychics cognise events present or future in the form of a
visual symbol which needs interpretation. Although we may regard normal
perception as in a sense representative of the external object, it is not a
174] The Psi Processes in Nortnal and " Paranormal " Psychology 185
representation of the physico-chemical processes in the central nervous
system which are its immediate causal ancestors. In a sense then the per-
cept may be regarded as a symbol of these events as the paranormal Wy
process may be a symbol of the external object or event cognised.
These are respects in which normal perceptual processes may be con-
sidered to resemble the paranormal Wy processes, or, at any rate, to differ
from them less than may appear at first sight. We must also consider a
respect in which the laws of normal perceptual and volitional processes
seem to be in sharp contrast with those of paranormal Wy and Wk. This is
the curious fact, often noted by experimenters, that effort to cognise in
E.S.P. and effort to control the die in P.K. experiments is generally in-
effective and tends even to reduce the rate of scoring. The most effective
condition seems to be one in which the subject of the experiment retains a
relatively casual attitude towards his successes, and one of the factors
causing decline in successive experimentation may be that the subject be-
gins to care too much about succeeding and intensifies his effort with con-
sequent falling off of score. But voluntary effort to cognise and to act
favours successful normal cognition and effective normal action, and
(within limits) success and effectiveness are increased as effort is intensified.
These facts suggest that the effect of effort may be to, direct W into the
normal channels of being informed through the processes of the sensory
ner\'ous system and of control of the motor nervous system, and con-
sequently away from the paranormal channels of direct interaction be-
tween Shin and object.
The adverse effect of volitional effort of !F success is illustrated by an
observation made by one of us (R.H.T.) accidentally in an experiment
directed towards other ends. When acting as experimenter in an experiment
on telepathy, he had the task of thinking of a number from one to ten and
then turning up one of a pack of playing cards and adding the number on
the card turned up to the one already thought of. No attempt was made to
make the number thought of the same as the one about to be turned up ;
whether it was or not was irrelevant to the purpose of the experiment.
Nevertheless it happened that the number thought of was identical with
the one immediately afterwards turned up 10 times in 40 observations,
whereas the chance expectation is 4. The probability of the chance
occurrence of a deviation from expectation as large as +6 is -0005. That
equal success would follow an effort to guess the next card seemed im-
probable from the relatively low rate of scoring in previous card-guessing
experiments with R.H.T. as subject [5]. To make sure on this point, the
experiment was repeated in exactly the same way immediately afterwards
but now R.H.T. was trying to guess the next card. Only chance results
were obtained. While too much weight must not be given to a single
observation showing a result which was not aimed at, the odds against
chance of 2,000 to i suggest strongly that similarly designed experiments in.
which the subject does not know that the object is to look for W effects
might give striking results.
There is less evidence that intensity of volitional effort has a bad effect
on success in psycho-kinetic experiments although this is the impression
of some experimenters in this subject. A playful attitude towards the
experiments rather than one of serious intensity has been reported by
i86 R. H. Thoiiless and B. P. Wiesner [Part
Rhine to be most favourable to success [21]. One may be led to suppose the
opposite by the fact that instructions to the subject are commonly that he
should " will " the dice to fall in the required ways. It must not, however,
be lost sight of that there seems to be no experimental evidence that this
" willing " is a necessary condition for success or even a favourable con-
dition. The intention that the dice should fall in a certain way may be all
that is required. It may even be that any way of drawing aftention to a
certain die face {e.g. by counting the number of times it fell upwards while
ignoring the others) might be sufficient to determine the P.K. reaction.
These are matters for experimental enquiry ; we must not assume that
" willing " is the cause of the reaction merely because subjects are often
instructed to " will ". Plainly the instruction does not inhibit the re-
action ; there is no evidence that it helps it and some reason to suppose
that strong volitional effort is unfavourable to success in psycho-kinesis.
If it is the case that effort directed towards W success tends to prevent
success, this may be simply explained if we suppose that voluntary effort
directs the W activity to its normal channel of communication with the
nervous system. We may note that to direct subjects in W experiments not
to try hard is merely a negative direction. It tells them one thing not to do ;
it does not tell them what they ought to do. If there were any way of
giving them a positive direction, of telling them what attitude they should
adopt to get W success, we should have solved one of the principal ex-
perimental difficulties in psychical research. Perhaps those subjects who
show consistently positive results in W experiments (the " psychics ")
have solved this problem for themselves. They too seem to be unable to
communicate to others the secret of their attitude. It is not to be expected
that they could. How could any of us convey what was the nature of
ordinary volitional effort (trying to do something in everyday life) to some-
one who did not already know how to try or make an effort. ?
The diagram in Fig. i represents in one part the direct knowledge of an
external object or event by a ¥^ process. Such direct knowledge is ordin-
arily now called " clairvoyance " (or " psychometry " when the situation
is such that the use of an intermediate object to provide linkage with what
is cognised is a salient feature of the situation). The suggestion that this
takes place by the same Wy process as that by which Shin is normally in
relation with the processes in the cerebral cortex in ordinary perception
does not imply that such clairvoyant awareness is of the nature of a sensory
perception obtained by extra-sensctf-y means. On our hypothesis, per-
ception of an object is a mode of awareness in which the brain process is an
essential link : without that link one has a different mode of awareness.
The differences to be expected between " paranormal " and normal
perception are, therefore, those due to the character imposed on normal
perception by the characteristics of brain processes and by the physical
and psychological conditions under which normal sensory perception takes
place.
For example, what objects we see and what sounds we hear are primarily
determined by such physical facts as the position of the head, the intensity
of the stimuli, their distance, the presence or absence of screening, the fact
that the stimuli reach the sense organs at the particular moment and not at
some other time, and so forth. If these factors are determined in a parti-
174] The Psi Processes in Normal and " Paranormal " Psychology 187
cular way, then we must see and hear more or less what we do see and hear
and nothing else. It is not quite true that our present perceptions are
wholly determined by such external factors since there are also internal
factors referred to as " interest " and " attention " which make a selection
from the potential material of perception. The whole body of potential
perceptual material is, however, determined by the above factors and if we
know that a man is at a certain place at a certain time and we also know all
the physical conditions of his environment and of himself, then we know
more or less what he is perceiving.
But these limitations are the result of the known characters of the sense-
organs and the perceptual processes ; if these are short-circuited in " para-
normal cognition " we cannot say what will be the limitations of the result-
ing cognitions. We have clearly no right to assume that they will be the
same as the limitations of sensory perceptions. Are we then to expect no
spatial and temporal limitations of paranormal cognitions? Clearly not,
for this would be equivalent in practice to no paranormal cognition at all.
If in a card-guessing experiment, a subject's responses were equally de-
termined by the order of every pack of cards in the universe whether past,
present or future, his results would be indistinguishable from a series of
random guesses. If success in such an experiment is obtained, this means
that somehow the subject's responses have been determined by the parti-
cular test set of cards. We may express this by saying that this test pack
of cards has been, by some means, " singularised " for the subject, just as
the normal perceptual field is singularised by the physical and other
conditions of perception.
Of the factors which may determine this singularisation we know little.
It appears experimentally that the intention of the experimenter or of the
subject that this particular pack of cards will be guessed may effect the
necessary singularisation. Both spontaneous cases and experimental
results suggest that clairvoyant singularisation may take place by a tele-
pathic impulse. In some cases singularisation takes place by the subject
of the experiment seeing or holding an object which has been in physical
contact with the object or person cognised. The process of W cognition is
then called " psychometry ", but there seems no reason for regarding this
as essentially a different process from other forms of clairvoyance. The
necessity for some means of singularisation is present in all ¥^7 phenomena
and not only in those that take place under psychometric conditions.
Another way in which the nature of the perceptual process determines
the resulting perception is in its phenomenal character. A seen objective
field gives a visual pattern in an anisotropic three-dimensional pheno-
menal space ; the music of an orchestra is perceived as a different kind of
pattern of sounds with relatively indefinite localisation. There is no reason
for expecting that a pure W cognition will have any of the phenomenal
characters of sight, sound, or any other modality of sense which depend
on the co-operation of the sensor}' perceptual apparatus. . We know, in
fact, that a W cognition is often received as a " symbol ", for example, as
a visual picture not representative of the thing cognised but requiring
interpretation. For example, a psychic has reported that she knew that
a friend was thinking of her (the psychic's) future because " I suddenly
saw a beam of golden light shoot from the head of my friend in an arch
i88 R. H. Thouless and B. P. Wiesner [Part
which passed over my head and fell beyond. I knew from its colour and
composition that it was of an intellectual order. I knew it concerned me
from its direction, and because the farther end of the arch fell beyond
my aura I instantly deduced that it was not connected with the present
moment" [lo]. Although this experience was phenomenally visual, it
was plainly not a visual perception since what was experienced was
not representative of what was cognised but symbolic of it. The mind
responded with one of its possible ways of experiencing [i.e. the visual)
to a mode of cognition which had no characteristic form of experience
peculiar to it.
It is not, therefore, to be expected that direct Wy knowledge of an event
or object v/ill generally appear to consciousness as a visual perception
representative of that event or object. On the other hand, it may do so
since perceptual representation is also a possible symbol by means of which
the W cognition may be presented to consciousness. This appears to be the
case in what is now called " travelling clairvoyance " or, in the Scots
Highlands, " second sight ", where the subject appears to see the scene
cognised as if it were a present visual perception. In these cases also,
there seems to be no reason for believing that a true visual perception of an
extra-sensory character is taking place. Rather it appears that they should
be regarded as symbolic presentations of the cognised data in which the
actual visual appearance has been utilised by the cognising mind as the
symbol for their presentation to consciousness.
Let us now consider the telepathic form of W. Telepathy has been
generally regarded either as a process of one brain acting on another brain
or as a process of one immaterial mind communicating with another
immaterial mind {i.e. in our terminology, one Shin communicating with
another Shin). There is a third possibility which we would suggest as a
more probable explanation : that telepathy is a process of Shin acting on
or being acted on by a nervous system other than its own.
The first type of explanation (that which regards telepathy as an inter-
communication between one brain and another without the ordinary
physical means of communication through the sense organs) remains within
the limits of explanation by interaction of physical systems. It has, there-
fore, the advantage of requiring no radically new departure in thought.
It is, however, a universally accepted postulate of science that for one
material system to act on another material system, there must be a physical
means of communication. Such a theory must, therefore, require the
postulation of some unknown form of radjation to account for telepathy.
For this there is no evidence, and, in view of the long distances over which
telepathic communication has taken place, apparently without loss of
effectiveness with increasing distance, the assumption must be regarded
as highly improbable if not definitely disproved.
No such objection can be urged against the hypothesis of one mind
acting on another mind if the mind is regarded as an immaterial entity (or,
in our nomenclature, one Shin acting on another Shin). If there is such a
process of communication, it is of a unique kind, and nothing can be said
of the conditions under which it would be possible. All that can, we think,
be legitimately said against it is that there seems no reason to postulate such
a process since we can regard telepathy more simply as an interaction be-
174] The Psi Processes in Normal a>id " Paranormal " Psychology 189
tween Shin and another nervous system without assuming any other pro-
cess of communication than those already postulated to account for
normal perception and clairvoyance on the one hand and normal volitional
action and psycho-kinesis on the other.
If we regard the W processes as the normal means by which Shin is in-
formed by and maintains control of its own nervous system, it does not
seem unlikely that, in some relatively unusual cases, these processes may
enable Shin to be informed by or to control some nervous system other than
its own. The process of telepathy would then be of essentially the same
nature as the processes by which I am in cognitive relation with my own
nervous system and control my own actions. It would then be neither more
nor less mysterious than these familiar normal processes.
Fig. 2 Fig. 3
This type of explanation would lead to two possible kinds of telepathy
which may be found in different cases.^ These two possibilities are shown
in figures 2 and 3. In both cases, A is the agent and B the percipient.
In the one case, there is a cognitive process on the part of i?—Shin B being
in cognitive relation by with the processes in ^'s nervous system (Fig.
2). In the other, there is a motor process in B initiated by Shin A—
Shin A influencing the motor part of 5's nervous system by *F/c (Fig. 3).
We may conveniently refer to these two kinds of telepathic process as
y-telepathy and /c-telepathy respectively.
If telepathy is sometimes a process of the type we have called y-telepathy
^ As has also been suggested by Driesch [13] who distinguishes between " thought-
reading " (y-telepathy) and " telepathy " (x-telepathy).
190 R. H. Thoiiless and B. P. Wiesner [Part
we have an explanation of the fact, observed frequently from the earliest
days of psychical research, that a percipient {e.g. a medium) may report
some memory of the agent of which the agent is not himself at the time
thinking. That is, the percipient seems to be tapping directly the nervous
system of the agent and not his consciousness ; he is able to become aware
of latent memories of the agent just as the agent himself might become aware
of them. This, we think, is an argument for regarding the process repre-
sented by Fig. 2 as an essential part in such telepathic situations.
Fig. 3, on the other hand, seems to represent the type of thought
transference aimed at in such an activity as the " willing game " in which
an action determined by A is carried out by B. It may also be the type of
telepathy involved in cases of spontaneous telepathy where a crisis in the
life of A seems to be a determining cause of a telepathic experiences of B.
This may not be Shin B becoming aware by of what is happening in
the nervous system of A. It seems more likely that A is the active one,
and that he is affecting the thought of B by action on the brain pro-
cesses of 5. In other words, this seems more easily explained as k-
telepathy.
In the experimental situation in which A turns up a card and B responds
with the name of that card, either type of process may be taking place.
As has been pointed out by Rhine [6], this experimental situation also does
not exclude the process commonly called clairvoyance which is represented
in Fig. I, i.e. direct cognition by Shin B of the object by means of Wy.
The latter possibility may, however, be excluded by a suitably devised
experiment in which there is no external object to be cognised [7]. It does
not seem to be possible at present to devise an experimental situation which
would discriminate between processes of y- and /c-telepathy.
We can, however, examine the nature of telepathic situations in order to
obtain light on which of these processes is involved. It has already been
argued that the fact that, in some cases, B may report a memory of A of
which A is not at the time aware, is evidence that, in those cases, there is a
process of y-telepathy. Similarly, we may consider the well-known fact
that, in card-guessing experiments, the subject may give right answers in
excess of chance expectation without knowing which of his answers is right
and which wrong. This makes it unlikely that his response is a cognitive
one (y-telepathy) and indicates strongly that it is a motor response directed
by the Wk of the agent, i.e. that it is K-telepathy.
Indications of the same kind are found in the experiments on repro-
ductions of drawings found in the first volume of our Proceedings [8].
On p. 191, for example, there is the drawing of a bird reproduced as a
geometrical figure with remarkably similar outline but without any idea
that a bird was the object represented. A cognitive process by the per-
cipient could not have failed to get the central fact in the agents' awareness
that a bird had been drawn unless it had failed altogether to hit on the
object. This reproduction must be regarded, therefore, as probably
telepathy of the k type in which Shin (agent) influenced the motor nervous
system of the percipient to draw the required outline.
The evidence seems, therefore, to suggest that both processes of y- and
of /f-telepathy may be present in telepathic phenomena, possibly one or
other being dominant in different situations.
174] Processes in Xormal and " Parunni nial " Psvrhologv 191
Another direction in which we may find evidence of action of one
Shin on another organism is in some, at any rate, of the phenomena of
hypnotism. Since the time of Liebault, it has become customary to regard
hypnotism as entirely an effect of " suggestion ", as the response of the
hypnotised person to verbal or other signals given by the hypnotiser and
perceived by the hypnotised person through normal sensory channels.
This explanation cannot, however be held to cover all the phenomena of
hypnotism unless we ignore some well attested results of the investigation
of hypnotism as, for example, the induction of hypnotism by the volition
of the hypnotiser without perceptible signals and at a distance even of half
a mile [17].
Let us now turn to a very different aspect of that found in the
phenomena of materialisation. We have no personal experience of these
and we know that there is controversy as to their reality. There seems,
however, to be sufficient evidence that materialisation phenomena some-
times take place. Much of the evidence is dubious and much is probably
fraudulent, but all that is necessary to support this conclusion is that at
least one materialisation should have taken place under conditions pre-
cluding fraud. There are probably more than one observation fulfilling
these conditions, but the observation of a hand-like protrusion observed
during a seance with Rudi Schneider on Dec. 23rd 1929 is sufficient to
establish the fact that such things can happen when the possibility of fraud
is excluded [9].^
The phenomena described are of some material or quasi-material sub-
stance apparently derived from the medium's body on which forms of
hands, faces, etc. are imposed. The principle we have adopted before in
trying to understand Wy and processes is that of supposing that they
also occur normally, as relations of ^ to the organism. Their paranormal
occurrence we have regarded as cases in which the processes are no longer
limited to the organism. In other words, we have supposed that any Shin
relation to the organism is a special case of a Wprocess. To try to explain a W
process we consider whether there is a known Shin relation to the organ-
ism which may be a special case of it.
Applying this method of thought to the phenomena of materialisation,
we are led to consider that this may be the more general process of which
the normal processes of bodily growth and regeneration are a special case.
In other words, materialisation phenomena may be regarded as relatively
unfamiliar examples of the process whose normal and familiar form is to
be found in the growth of the organism or the healing of a wound. The
theory that growth and regeneration are processes of Shin acting on the
organism is, of course, Driesch's theory of the entelechy. This theory has
been generally rejected by physiologists and biologists who have pre-
ferred to regard growth and regeneration as processes entirely determined
in a material manner by physico-chemical forces within the organism
itself. The occurrence of exo-somatic form-producing activities {i.e.
materialisations) suggests the possibility that this orthodox materialist
view of growth and regeneration may not be a complete account of the
matter.
^ Or the more extensive evidence of the wax moulds obtained by Geley from
materialisations produced by Franek Kluski [19].
192 R. H. Thoidess and B. P. Wiesner [Part
It is possible that the form-producing activity of Shin should be re-
garded as the same process as Wk. Provisionally, however, we prefer to
treat it as a separate W process and to label it 'Fe (psi-epsilon).
We have already considered the possibility that some cases of telepathy
are examples of Shin A acting by Wk on the motor nervous system of B.
There is a parallel possibility that Shin A may act by fe on the structures
of the organism of 5. Thus the organic injury of B might be repaired by
processes initiated by the activity of Shin A. That this can take place is,
of course, claimed by many people with high W capacities ; it is the pro-
cess commonly known as " psychic healing ". It has become usual for
scientific psychology to dismiss all psychic healing as the healing of func-
tional disorders by means of suggestion. That is, it is regarded as an action
by the healer through normal sensory means on the nervous system of the
healed person and the removal from the patient of symptoms which have been
created by his own thought, that is, by the activity of his own nervous system.
The opinion that psychic healing is merely the cure by suggestion of
functional disorders is not, however, accepted by religious or other psychic
healers and there is some reason for doubting whether it can be supported
without some arbitrary selection of the evidence. The hypothesis here
outlined would explain psychic healing in a way different from that of the
suggestion theory, as the action of one Shin facilitating a healing process
in the organism of another. In other words, it would be a healing process
of the same kind as that normally taking place in the body under the
trophic influence of the central or autonomic nervous systems except that
the direction of the process would be from outside instead of from inside
the individual. This hypothesis does not, of course, imply an unlimited
power of psychic healing but it does imply different limits from those of
healing by suggestion.
First, healing by suggestion is limited to cases where the patient is aware
by normal sensory means (generally by hearing) of the healing suggestions
made ; it cannot succeed if the patient is unconscious or is unaware of
what the person making the suggestions is doing. There is no reason for
expecting psychic healing to be limited in this way if it is a We. activity
from another Shin. It might well be successful when the patient was not
aware of the healer's intentions or even when he was unconscious.
Secondly, healing by suggestion is generally supposed to be limited to
disorders of a psycho-neurotic type, i.e. those caused by the thought,
expectation, or unconscious volition of the patient. On our hypothesis,
psychic healing should not be expected to be limited in this way. The
limitation to be expected is that psychic healing would be limited to pro-
cesses in another organism which are, in one's own organism, under Shin
control
—
i.e. not irreversible degenerative processes or injuries but those
which under favourable conditions may heal spontaneously. The union
of a broken bone might, for example, be accelerated by psychic healing,
but it could not be expected to have any influence on a lesion of the brain
since there are no true regenerative processes in injured brain tissue.
A further limitation to be expected in psychic healing is that it is likely
to be dependent on the healed person being in some way picked out or
" singularised " by the healer. In practice, this singularisation is generally
effected by the healer placing his hands on the person to be healed, but it is
174] The Psi Processes in Normal and " Paranormal " Psychology 193
also claimed by some psychic healers that merely thinking of the person to
be healed is sufficient.
What has been said above about Shin influence in regenerative or forma-
tive bodily processes may be supposed also to apply to degenerative pro-
cesses initiated by Shin, such as the formation of stigmata. It is possible
that these also might be produced in one organism by the We activity of
another Shin. We should then have a " paranormal " production of
degenerative processes such as has been attributed in the past to certain
practices of black magic. Of such We efi^ects (except for minor lesions),
we know of no contemporary evidence, *although, if the possibility of
psychic healing is admitted, there seems no reason for regarding a parallel
production of degenerative eff^ects as impossible. It does not, however,
seem necessary to discuss these further since the theoretical problems
involved would not differ from those of regenerative processes.
To summarise the views here put forward. We have suggested parallel
hypotheses relating : (a) paranormal cognition with normal perception,
(b) psycho-kinesis with normal volitional activity, and (c) materialisation
and psychic healing with normal growth and regeneration. In each case
we have supposed that these are processes depending on a non-material
entity which we have indicated by the symbol ^ (Shin). The functions of
Shin involved we have labelled Wy, Wk, and We respectively. We have
postulated that these normally relate Shin with its own bodily organism
[i.e. that normally they are endo-somatic) but that also they occur excep-
tionally in their " paranormal " forms acting exo-somatically.
It is obvious that these three hypotheses are logically not mutually de-
pendent ; the truth of any of them does not entail the truth of any of the
others. The relation between them is that all suggest the same general
form of explanation. In each case we are trying to fit the pieces of the jig-
saw together in the same way, the way suggested by the very plausible idea
that perhaps the paranormal processes are not as odd as at first sight they
appear but are familiar processes occurring in unusual circumstances. In
each case, we have supposed that the " normal " process is a special case
of the more general process which includes the " paranormal " form of the
process, just as, for example, plane geometry is a special case of the more
general propositions of solid geometry, or as the Newtonian laws of motion
are a special case of relativity laws of motion.
This view obviously implies that E.S.P. and P.K. are closely related
processes, both being, as it were, occasional discharges into the outside
world of processes normally taking place between Shin and the nervous
system. The implied relationship has in its favour the evidence of parallel-
ism between these two classes of phenomena. Thus Rhine speaks of : "a
large accumulation of experimental evidence which has given us much the
same picture of the conditions affecting performance in P.K. tests as it has
for success in E.S.P. experiments. Psychological, physiological, and social
influences have had similar effects upon both types of ability. Position
effects are much alike for both, and both are essentially unconscious
functions. The general experimental results have thus made it easy for the
logical interrelation represented by a common name to find acceptance
"
[14]. To a common name we now suggest the addition of a common
hypothesis of origin. ', .
194 ^- H. Thoiiless and B. P. Wiesner [Part
The suggested relationship between clairvoyance and telepathy is closer
since our suggestion implies that one form of telepathy (y-telepathy) is
identical with clairvoyance, except for the difference that the Wy process is
directed towards the nervous system of another person in the one case and
towards some other external object in the other.
If this suggestion be true, it explains the early observation of Rhine that
those subjects who were good in telepathy tests were also good in clair-
voyance tests to about the same degree [15]. It is true that what he then
called " telepathy " and " clairvoyance " tests would not now be regarded
as satisfactory tests for pure telepathy and pure clairvoyance since the
" telepathy " tests did not exclude the possibility of precognitive clair-
voyance and the " clairvoyance " tests did not exclude the possibility of
precognitive telepathy. On the other h^nd, the telepathy tests did exclude
the possibility of straight {i.e. present time) clairvoyance and the clair-
voyance tests excluded straight telepathy. The fact that these two
exclusions did not have any apparent differential effect on subjects' per-
formances strongly suggests that, if the two conditions excluded were
effective at all in favouring successful results (which later successes
under " pure clairvoyance " conditions make it impossible to doubt),
then they must have been about equally effective in producing suc-
cessful results. This suggests that the processes involved under these
two conditions were essentially the same, as is supposed by our hypo-
thesis.
It should be apparent that there is nothing novel in the suggestion that
there is some entity which controls the organism in volition and which is
informed by the organism in perceptual processes. This was universally
believed until comparatively recent times when the idea of a soul or self
was discarded by the physiologists and experimental psychologists, and all
mental processes, including those of volition and cognition, came to be
regarded as merely aspects of the material processes of the organism.
Indeed, so late as the middle of the nineteenth century, Braid could write :
" I look upon the brain simply as the organ of the mind " and could equate
the relation of the " soul and the bodily organs " to that of the musician
to his musical instrument [11]. This way of thinking, which sounds old-
fashioned to those whose minds are attuned to current psychological and
physiological conceptions, was the scientific orthodoxy of a century ago.
In this matter, we are only suggesting a return to a way of thinking which
was at one time generally accepted.
There is no such venerable ancestry for the other part of our hypothesis
that extra-sensory perception, psycho-kinesis, and materialisation are exo-
somatic examples of processes familiar to us in their endo-somatic forms
as normal perception, normal volition, and normal growth processes re-
spectively. Indeed such a hypothesis could not have been formulated
until, in comparatively recent times, psychical research had demonstrated
the reality of these " paranormal " processes.
Once this reality has been demonstrated, the formulation of the hypo-
thesis is an obvious step if we can overcome the barrier of the way of think-
ing which regards the " mind " or " soul " as a mere aspect of organic
processes. In 1943, Rhine and Pratt suggested in an Editorial in the
Journal of Parapsychology that psycho-kinesis was the process by which the
174] The Psi Processes in Normal and " Paranoniial " Psychology 195
mind acted on the body [12].^ While doubting the appropriateness of the
word " mind " in this connection, for reasons already discussed, we recog-
nise that this is essentially the same view as our suggestion that psycho-
kinesis is an exo-somatic form of the same Wk process as that which con-
trols the organism in normal volition. The same idea with respect to the
Wk explanation of hypnotic phenomena was clearly suggested by F. W. H.
Myers in 1886 when he wrote " perhaps when I attend to a thing, or will a
thing, I am directing upon my own nervous system actually that same force
which, when I direct it on another man's nervous system, is the '
vital
influence '
of mesmerists, or the '
telepathic impact ' of which Mr
Gurney and I have said so much " [17]. A parallel idea to that in our
suggestion with respect to We was put forward by Driesch who referred to
materialisation as " a supernormal embryology " [13]. We have not, so
far, met with any previous suggestion that normal sensory perception is
the relation that the mind or soul has by means of Wy with what is going
on in the sensory part of the nervous system of the organism. That also may,
however, have been suggested by other psychical researchers before now.
A further consequence of the views sketched here is that we become
doubtful of the appropriateness of the implications of the word " para-
normal " for such facts as E.S.P. and P.K. We are suggesting that they
are examples of processes which are themselves normal and indeed familiar,
but occurring in other than the familiar situation. They may be no more
" paranormal " than the facts following from Einstein's theory of relativity.
Physicists do not regard the Newtonian laws of motion as " normal " and
those motion and gravitation effects which follow the principles of relativity
as paranormal ;
they regard the Newtonian principles as a special case of a
more general set of principles which includes also the relativity phenomena.
This special case happens to be more familiar than the exceptions to it
because most observable phenomena of movement occur within the limits
of velocity for which Newtonian principles are approximately true. If we
had been born in a universe in which all velocities of bodies were near
that of light, then the Einstein laws would have been the familiar ones.
Similarly most facts of cognition and volition occur under the limiting
condition that the W inter-action between Shin and the material world is
restricted to that part of the material world which is the nervous system of
the organism. This limitation also may be an accidental circumstance of
the world in which we live. We might have lived in a world in which the
W action of Shin was not commonly so limited. Then what we now call
" paranormal " cognition and " paranormal " movements of objects would
be as familiar as they are now uncommon. If the means of interaction
between Shin and the material world is, as we have suggested, the same for
its endo-somatic forms, the contrast between these is between processes
that are usual and those that are unusual, not between those that are normal
and those that are in any sense not-normal.

^ This may also have been in the mind of Barrett when he wrote in 1886 :
" mind,
occasionally and unconsciously, can exert a direct influence upon lifeless matter. Upon
the living organised matter of the brain mind can and does act, i.e. if we admit mind
apart from matter " [16].

OBITUARY : MR W. WHATELY CARINGTON, M.Sc.
The President, Mr W. H. Salter, writes as follows :
In the middle of the First World War there joined the Society a young man,
whose science studies at Cambridge had been interrupted by Army Service.
Mr Whately Smith (as he was then called) was destined during the suc-
ceeding thirty years to be one of the leading figures in our Society, dis-
tinguished by his originality in introducing methods new to psychical
research, his ingenuity and pertinacity in applying them, and the lively
skill with which he presented his results.
During the first few years he was content to follow well-beaten trails.
In December 1916 he had a sitting with Kathleen Goligher in Belfast, and
in Proceedings vol XXX he described the sitting, and at the same time
reviewed the Goligher phenomena as a whole, summing up in favour of
their genuineness. In 1920 he was a member of the S.P.R. committee,
which investigated " Eva C." on her visit to London that year and reported
cautiously—most cautiously—in her favour. In the same year he published
The Foundations of Spiritualism, a small book containing an admirable
summary of the evidence for survival, as it then stood. In it he shows a
thorough understanding of what may be called the traditional work of the
Society. He was, however, soon after to break with tradition, and launch
out on lines of his own planning.
It was the freshness of his approach to old problems that must have
struck everyone who first met him soon after his return to Kings. There
is nothing more attractive than a young, tall, good-looking intellectual,
witty, widely read and desperately keen on his chosen task. Science and
psychical research divided between them his main intellectual interest.
The relations between them were not as cordial and intimate as he thought
they should be, and he made it one of his main objects to place them on a
better footing.
There were, he recognised, faults on both sides. The materialist bias of
many scientists was repugnant to his philosophy, and his book The Death of
Materialism (1933) was written to combat it.
It is clear, however, that he considered the main fault to lie on the side of
psychical research. The Society, when he joined it, had been in existence
for thirty-four years, long enough for nearly the whole generation that saw
its birth to have passed away, and long enough, in many institutions, for
the process of fossilisation to have become well-advanced. As to some
time-honoured branches of psychical research he thought this had already
taken place, and he was at no pains to conceal his opinion that the collection
of spontaneous cases, and qualitative experiments in telepathy, however
useful as pioneer work in the " eighties," offered no promise of progress.
The great contributions which Myers and Gurney had made to the medical
psychology of their generation seemed to have little bearing on the doctrines
of Freud and Jung, which were then gaining publicity in this country. He
was not unaware that the Society had in its studies of automatic writing
struck out a new line of research, but though, as he showed in The Founda-
197
igS W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part
tions of Spiritualism, he was familiar with this work and its implications, it
did not seem to him a work likely to convince, or even attract, men of
science. The Society, he urged, ought to make more use of quantitative
methods familiar to the scientist, in combination with recent developments
in psychological technique. This led him, as early as 192 1, to suggest as a
" New method of research " {Proc. XXXI) the application of the word-
association test, to the investigation of the psychological status of medi-
umistic Controls, as it had already been applied by American psychologists
to one case of abnormal secondary personality. It was not, however, till
some years later that it was found possible to apply the method to three
mediums, Mrs Leonard, Mrs Garrett and Rudi Schneider, and their
Controls. In a series of later investigations the same method was applied
to several communicators. The results were set out in a series of papers in
Proceedings, entitled " The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities
"
"
(Q.S.T.P.) from 1934 on. The difficulties of interpreting the figures
aroused much controversy, but the method of. analysis strongly suggests
that in some instances at least Controls are secondary personalities of the
medium produced by repression. This was an important result, in itself,
but the uncertainty of interpretation attaching to most of the data of this
very elaborate investigation was a disappointment.
In 1933 Mr Whately Smith resumed the family name of Carington,
under which his later work is to be found indexed in our Proceedings and
Journal.
It was a belief firmly held by him that the Society would make more
progress if it attempted fewer tasks at one time. He had for long been
interested in the implications of telepathy (see Journal XXVIII, 57), and
was anxious that the Society should concentrate its energies on demon-
strating telepathy to the scientist by methods the scientist would recognise
as cogent. With this in view, as soon as the labours of Q.S.T.P. began to
ease off, he worked out a technique of repeatable, quantitative experiment.
This required the collaboration of a representative group or groups of
percipients. It was not the least of Carington's merits as a psychical
researcher that he was able to inspire others with his own keenness, so that
the necessary groups were not lacking. Important data were obtained, but
the experimental side of the work was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
This did not, however, interfere with Carington's analysis of the data
already obtained.
His work on telepathy is too recent and too well known to need descrip-
tion here. Mention may, however, be made of two matters which illustrate
his qualities as an investigator and as a man. He was very generous in
passing on to other persons conducting research on similar lines points
arising in his own work which struck him as likely to be of interest to them :
the phenomenon of " displacement ", for example. He was, again, most
anxious that his readers should have every opportunity of following not
only his results, but the reasoning by which he arrived at them, and he
sometimes credited his readers with an ability to master involved statistical
argument which they were far from possessing. His book on Telepathy
gained immediate recognition as an outstanding contribution to the theory
of the subject.
He was the fortunate possessor of an extremely lively style. Quantitative
174] Obituary 199
work inevitably tends to aridity, but Carington's reader is constantly
refreshed by passages of keen, sometimes pungent, wit and apt illustration.
These qualities appear in all his numerous writings, which in this respect
conform to the best traditions of S.P.R. literature.
Carington was a believer in survival of some kind, while having, he con-
fessed, a strong repugnance to " Spiritualism " as frequently expounded.
He did not think that the problem could be usefully debated until various
philosophical difficulties had been cleared up. This was the task on which
he was engaged at the time of his death, but he left unfinished the book that
was intended to embody his solution. May we hope that it will be com-
pleted and brought to publication by some other hand?
From his schooldays on everyone who knew Carington was struck by the
thoroughness and pertinacity with which he carried out any work he under-
took. Without these qualities he could never have accomplished what he
did in the face of obstacles. First of these must be mentioned his health,
which compelled him to live abroad for considerable periods. It is a mark
of the high regard that the Council had for his work that he was retained
as a member both of the Council and of the Committee of Reference and
was chosen as Myers Memorial Lecturer, during his long residence out of
the country. None the less, the lack of close personal contact with col-
leagues during these years and still more during the war raised diffi-
culties which were not wholly met by the fullness with which he was pre-
pared to discuss in correspondence matters relating to psychical research.
Life abroad was congenial to him, and exclusion from it as the result of
the war would have depressed him, even if the alternative had not been the
discomforts of a small Cornish cottage, which nothing could have made
tolerable but the housewifely skill and devotion of Mrs Carington. For
his finances were not such as to permit him those amenities which the
intellectual worker highly values.
Dr. Thouless, who was brought into close contact with his experimental
work, writes as follozvs: ,
After the war of 1914, Whately Carington returned to Cambridge to do
research on the psycho-galvanic reflex; his book The Measurement of
Emotion (Kegan Paul) was based on this work. His main interest was not,
however, in the reflex itself but in the possibility of using it as a means of
studying trance personalities. While doing this work at Cambridge, he
had already devised the plan of the method by which he hoped to find out
whether the spirits which communicated through mediums were genuine
autonomous personalities, and also whether the controls were autonomous
personalities or merely dissociated parts of the medium's own personality.
This work was completed many years later and published in the Proceedings
as a series of articles on " The Quantitative Study of Trance Personalities".
This was a brilliantly designed experimental plan which well displayed
Whately Carington's gifts of boldness and originality. In its main purpose
the plan miscarried since critical analysis of his figures showed that he was
mistaken in believing that they showed evidence that " spirits " were
autonomous perspnalities. There were, however, clear indications of the
truth of the hypothesis that the controls were dissociated parts of the
medium's personality.
200 W. Whately Caringion, M.Sc. [Part
After a not very successful set of experiments on precognition in dice
throwing, Whately Carington started work on the paranormal cognition
of drawings (also published as a series of articles in the Proceedings).
Early in this work he suspected that the straightforward methods of mark-
ing success were vitiated by the subjects being paranormally influenced by
the drawings exposed on nights before that on which they made their
reproduction and also by those to be exposed on succeeding nights. The
correctness of this surmise was amply confirmed and his discovery of the
fact of temporal displacement in experiments on paranormal cognition is
the principal new fruit of this research. During recent years, he had been
engaged in work on psycho-kinesis with the same energy and enthusiasm.
The results of these investigations have not yet been published.
In his attitude towards quantitative experimental work Whately Caring-
ton challenged tradition and showed himself a progressive. He was not
interested in the mere repetition of standard experiments already per-
formed by other people in the hope of accumulating an ever increasing
weight of evidence of the same kind. He regarded quantitative experi-
mental investigation as primarily a means of making discoveries about the
nature of psychical phenomena and not merely of proving that they exist.
'
This function of quantitative experiment is commonplace in other branches
of the biological sciences although it has been little employed in psychical
research. When Whately Carington repeated his own experiments, his
object was not merely to accumulate proof but to obtain data the analysis
of which would reveal something of the laws underlying psychical pheno-
mena. He may sometimes have overestimated the revealing power of
statistical analysis but he never doubted that the function of quantitative
experimentation was to find explanations and not merely to increase the
weight of evidence.
The two most obvious characteristics of Whately Carington as an ex-
perimenter were his industry and his boldness. Both sometimes led him
astray. His industry sometimes led him to embark on an elaborate mass of
c^culations with only a trivial end in view ; his boldness sometimes led
him to try to extract significance from mere accidental peculiarities of his
figures. But these were also gifts which made him a fruitful experimenter.
His boldness led him to explore possibilities that a more cautious enquirer
would have ignored, and his industry led him to examine them with a
thoroughness that extracted the last grain of information from them.
These explorations did not always lead to fruitful results and he was from
time to time misled by over-confidence in his conclusions, but they did
succeed often enough to justify his departure from the beaten track of con-
ventional experimentation. He might often go along a cul-de-sac with the
confidence that others would feel only when their feet were on the high
road, but his justification was that sometimes what appeared to be a cul-
de-sac turned out to be really a path to something new.
We are indebted to Mr. Fraser Nicolfor thefollowing personal appreciation :
My tale was heard, and yet it was not told ;
My fruit is fallen, and yet my leaves are green ;
My youth is spent, and yet I am not old ;
I saw the world, and yet I was not seen ;

My thread is cut, and yet it is not spun ;
And now I live, and now my life is done.
TiCHBOURNE, On the Eve oj Death, 1586
Whately Carington once described himself as " a member of the smallest
profession in the world—the Profession of Psychical Research." He went
on to remark (surprised a little by his own reflections) that there were only
half a dozen men whose only occupation and main means of livelihood was
psychical investigation. I remember the occasion well, for it wis the first
time I had met him. He gazed into space in that curiously abstracted way
of his, and began to reel off the names on the roll of the Profession. At each
name he bent a finger, and having disposed of the whole of one hand he
paused searching his mind for the sixth and last name. For a time it could
not be found ; then with a sudden smile of enlightenment he exclaimed,
" Of course
—
myself\
" This momentary forgetfulness of self was the cause
of some surprise to him, for he was presently confessing himself to be
" beastly egocentric ". A disarming candour was one of Carington's most
attractive characteristics.
As a man he could be fitted into no known pattern or category. In his
greatness (and those who knew him well will scarcely question that he had
the stuff of greatness in him) and in his limitations he was unique of his
kind. He could always be depended upon to do the unusual and unex-
pected thing. The occasion mentioned above was the culmination of a
long, and on one side at least, a lively correspondence, in the course of
which I had invited him to visit me in Scotland. Nothing came of this
proposal for many months—I cannot remember that he even acknowledged
it, such was the man absorbed in other things—until one summer evening
the telephone rang and a distant voice announced itself as that of Whately
Carington speaking from Amsterdam Airport. He badly needed a
change, he said, and (hesitantly) might he be allowed to arrive next
morning?
So, the following forenoon, he stood on the doorstep, smiling with a
curious shyness. He was immensely tall, somewhere over six feet two
inches in height, and like many very tall men, slightly stooped. His eyes
were pale blue-grey and looked with a gentle penetrating gaze through
thick glasses, and his fair hair crowned a head which seemed proportion-
ately greater than his body. He was then about forty years of age, but
even at that time the complexities and strains of life had aged him beyond
his years.
With him he brought all he found necessary to pursue (on holiday) the
daily work of psychical research—a massive and burdensome electrical
calculating machine, and an outsize in suitcases which he was soon dis-
gorging of the greater part of its contents—files of mediumship data,
stationery, books and—an ashtray which accompanied him on all his travels.
He was born Walter Whately Smith, but in later life reverted to the old
family name of Carington, derived from Carentan in Brittany, the original
home of the family. Looking back on his life he could not remember a
time, even in early childhood, when his disposition was not shy and pain-
fully sensitive. Those difficulties never left him, and he attributed some
of the distress they caused him to early ethical teachings which were de-
202 W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part
rived more from the rigorous outlook of the Old Testament than the com-
parative gentleness of the New.
His days at Eton and Cambridge were memorable mainly—and almost
exclusively—for the rapturous delights of Science. Sport, in most of its
forms, interested him not at all : he had no competitive instinct. In
science he had all the physical and intellectual endowments that go to make
a great experimentalist and thinker—an enquiring cast of mind, acute
powers of observation, intelligence that was both analytic and constructive,
a pair of clever and sensitive hands, and not least a spirit of adventure
tempered by a shrewd caution. In any piece of work undertaken by him
his thoroughness was extraordinary.
In the latter part of the first world war he served in the Royal Air Force
and took some pride in having piloted twenty-nine types of aircraft. He
was involved, however, in a perilous and unnerving forced landing on the
Channel coast which seriously disturbed his health. Illnesses thereafter
interrupted the course of his work.
It was during that war that his interest was drawn to psychical research
by some experiences with mediums narrated to him by a relative. Soon
afterwards, December 19 16, he had the first of several sittings with Mrs
Osborne Leonard. As he wrote long afterwards, he was then " a wholly
obscure convalescent subaltern, unconnected in any public way with
spiritualism or psychical research and only beginning to take a rather
dilletante interest in them." The striking evidence off^ered by Feda
(supported and strengthened by encyclopaedic reading of the literature
thereafter) was sufficient to destroy the apologetic dilletantism.
From that time forth—and although for a period after the war he was
engaged in psychological research at Cambridge and spent some years in
acoustical research with special reference to psychological problems, for
the Air Ministry and War Office—it may be said that the strongest urge of
his life was to explore and, if possible, to solve some of the most resistant
problems of the invisible world.
He made two journeys to Belfast to examine the telekinetic mediumship
of Kathleen Goligher. On the first occasion he was convinced—and never
afterwards changed his opinion—that the phenomena at that time were
genuine. But four years later (his second visit) he found a " conspicuous
and startling deterioration " and he concluded that the mediumship had
become fraudulent. In 1920 he was a member of the S.P.R. Committee
which investigated the materialising medium Eva C, with inconclusive
results.
Many years later I tried to attract his interest to physical mediumship,
but he was not to be drawn. You try scores of experiments with a medium,
he said in effect, and at the end of it all you do not know even whether you
have been testing a medium or merely a clever conjuror. He believed that
progress in psychical research was most likely to come " at the present
stage of our knowledge " from the study of comparatively simple things
like telepathy, clairvoyance and precognition. Nevertheless he showed
great interest in the telekinetic mediumship of Rudi Schneider when he
saw that the phenomena had a close bearing upon his own work in psycho-
kinesis.
In the early nineteen-twenties his literary output was considerable. In
ly^] Obituary 203
1920, when he was in his twenty-eighth year, he published A Theory of the
Mechanism of Survival and The Foundations of Spiritualistn. The latter
consisted for the most part of a summary of the evidence favourable to the
survival hypothesis together with a note on his own' views at that date.
Briefly, his opinion was :
The experimental evidence for Survival and Communication with the
deceased is distinctly good, and shows a tendency to become increas-
ingly so. But it is very difficult to set a limit to the potentialities of
the incarnate mind, and it would be rash to assess the chance of the
" spiritistic
" hypothesis at a value appreciably greater than one half.
In later years he came gradually to the view that some part of the
personality survives death.
The other book was more important and showed some of Canngton's
qualities as a speculative thinker. For purposes of discussion he assumed
that consciousness survives physical death and proceeded to construct a
theory of Four-dimensional Space which would, he considered, go some
way towards explaining the mechanism of survival and also some of the
phenomena of sleep, trance, anaesthesia and other forms of insensibility.
The book seems to have attracted little attention—it was not reviewed in
our Proceedings or Journal. In the course of years the theory underwent a
gradual modification at his own hands, due in part to a growing interest m
modern conceptions of Non-Euclidean Space. Those revised theories and
views would have found their place in a large-scale work on Survival which
was under consideration—and a small part of it written—at the time of his
death. (Here, as in other matters of authorship and research, " his thread
was cut, and yet it was not spun ".)
The year 1920 was a period of intense activity. He produced the two
books already mentioned ; in April he was co-opted a member of Council
;
in July he issued the first number of The Psychic Research Quarterly ;
he
was engaged also in psychological research at Cambridge ;
and the idea
was germinating in his mind for the future " Quantitative Study of Trance
Personalities ". If high quality of contents could have ensured success the
Quarterly would still be in existence today ; in fact after a year it was found
necessary to reconstitute it as Psyche, "a quarterly review of psychology
in relation to education, psycho-analysis . . . psychical research etc.",
Carington continuing as editor of the re-fashioned review for some years.
So far as his activhies as an investigator are concerned—as distinct from
his work as a contemplative thinker—Carington will best be remembered
hereafter for his ingenious and vast application of quantitative methods to
psychical phenomena. His first use of mathematical methods of assess-
ment goes back to the early nineteen-twenties when he was employing, in
Dr William Brown's words, " highly original " methods in the investiga-
tion of emotion and affective tone in his Cambridge experiments with the
psycho-galvanic reflex mechanism. Some ninety subjects were tested m
this way and more than 45,000 observations were made. The results of
those studies were described in The Measurement of Emotion. About the
same time he was proposing the use of the same procedures as " an entirely
new line of attack " for the investigation of the psychological status of the
" Controls " of mediumistic trance.
204 W. Whately Caringtott, M.Sc. [Part
A dozen years were to pass before he was able to put the project into
action. Carington's cogitations on the state of survival research at this
time {ca. 1933) were gloomy. The Society for Psychical Research had been
in existence for half a century. In its early days there appeared to have
been an expectation amongst its membership that some great new scientific
truth was about to burst upon the world. The Society had now published
some seventy volumes, a large proportion of whose pages contained evidence
bearing upon the survival problem. But the world was no nearer accepting
the great new truth (if truth it were) than ever it had been.
By this time Carington had come very cautiously to the opinion that the
survival hypothesis offered the most economical explanation of the pub-
lished mediumistic evidence. He was quick to add, however, that that was
no more than a personal opinion. It was a judicial judgement and as such
was a long way from being a scientific truth. He considered that so long as
" witness-box " methods (a5 in the examination and study of ostensible
communicators) continued to be used as the main instrument of research,
there was little prospect of bringing the matter to a critical issue.
He had no illusions as to the long and hard road that lay ahead for
psychical researchers, but he firmly believed that the pace of their journey
might be quickened by the adoption and exploitation of new methods.
These methods were the instrumental methods of scientific men, the results
being assessed by mathematics. But it had to be made clear that " Outside
of pure mathematics and other organised symbol systems there can be no
such thing as absolute proof, but only the establishing of a greater or
smaller probability." It was likely, he thought, that a long time would
elapse before the demonstrable probability of survival would reach so over-
whelming a value as to be universally coercive.
Discarding the old " judicial " methods of attack, he called in the pro-
cedures of the laboratory. This was his " Quantitative Study of Trance'
Personalities ". It occupied almost the whole of his daily life for five years.
Four reports were issued between the years 1934 and 1939. It is scarcely
possible to give an adequate summary of the work in a short space ; the
reader may be referred tq Carington's own published accounts, or to Dr
Thouless's very lucid and valuable review of the first three reports, printed
in Proceedings vol. 44. The general method employed was that of the Word
Association Test of Jung, use being made of the Psycho-galvanic Reflex
mechanism, the Reaction Time, and Disturbances in Reproduction.
Those techniques were applied to four mediums (in their normal state)—
Mrs Leonard, Mrs Garrett, Mrs Sharplin and Herr Rudi Schneider—to
their trance Controls, and to the ostensible spirit Communicators. By
such means Carington hoped to show whether the Controls and Spirits
were independent of the mediums.
On only one point was he able to come to any firm conclusion—that the
so-called Controls were secondary personalities of the mediums. As for
the question of the autonomy of Communicators no certain answer could
be returned—the statistical assessment did not permit of a plain yes or no
reply. It appeared to Carington, however, that there was on the whole
good reason to suspect the operation of some " non-medium " factor and
that therefore the case for the independence of the communicators was
strengthened.
174] Obituary 205
Whately Carington was a pioneer. Never for him the well-worn paths
nor the well-tried methods of approach. And as an audacious pioneer he
encountered all the difficulties and suffered all the disappointments
attendant on pioneering work. Shortly before the investigation began he
had almost no knowledge of modern statistics. He set himself to learn
—
out of intolerably difficult books—and the wonder was that he learned so
much. When the books did not supply a valid method, Professor Fisher
and Mr W. L. Stevens could be depended on to elucidate difficulties.
Almost any other man would have realised early on that the work was
too much for one mind and one pair of hands, and would probably have
cut it short on the not unreasonable excuse that the problems he had set
were impossible of solution. But Carington had unlimited powers of per-
severation.
Physically alone, the work was a serious strain. To begin with he worked
many thousands of calculations on a little hand-operated calculating
machine, which caused an affection of his elbow. The Society's Council
came to his aid with a magnificent electrically-driven calculating machine
which greatly eased the labour and speeded up the work. " It does more
work in a day ", he wrote with exultant exaggeration, " than any six men
could do in a month
—
and more accurately!
"
But even so, the anxieties were not removed. His health was in an
indifferent state, and he was living in Holland at a village on the edge of the
Zuyder Zee, and subsisting on ^n income of £120 a year. The Society
came to his assistance with a grant (the first of a number of grants) which
alleviated his situation but at the same time intensified his fears—the
haunting fear that after all the award might be wasted on work which in
the end would produce no conclusive result. His extreme conscientious-
ness only added to his distress and may have contributed to the steady
undermining of his health. At one period he was writing of "an in-
describably purgatorial time," of " mistake after mistake " being found ;
and again, " I have never had such a struggle in my life as with this work.
The drudgery alone, of which, I suppose not more than a fifth part is even
suggested by the final product, was formidable ... I won't write more or I
shall start telling you all about how tiresome everything is ... If one insists
on grossly overworking for five months one must not be surprised at break-
ing down . . . (But) Phoenix is my middle name and I'm not (unfortunately
I sometimes feel) dead yet ;
though I have no reason to suppose that the
next life will show any improvement on this."
During an interval in the trance-personality work he conducted some
exploratory experiments in Precognition. He recruited some forty subjects
whose task it was to forecast the fall of dice. The investigation was of a
very tentative nature, and the experience gained proved of great value when
he later conducted his very important research in the Paranormal Cognition
of Drawings. It was in the course of the dice-work that the idea of the
Displacement Effect first occurred to him, and a hint of it is given in the
Journal of June 1935, where he compared each guess—there were 51,240
guesses in all—not only with the throw for which it was intended but with
the next and also with the next but one.
The results of the experiments were suggestive rather than significant,
and they formed another example of Carington's vast and laborious spade-
2o6 W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part
work in previously unexplored fields. He would often say, with amused
self-depreciation that he " tried all the wrong ways first". I do not think
that in so doing it ever occurred to him how much he was preserving later
workers from the innumerable pitfalls that beset his pioneering labours.
In the spring of 1938 Carington was married to a German lady, Hedda
Enders. The circumstances were such as are not usually associated with
such ceremonies—though they do not appear surprising against the back-
ground of pre-war Germany. They had known each other for some years,
and in recent times Hedda Enders had suff'ered the grim experience of being
jailed and put through the third degree by the German Secret Police.
Carington's moral and physical courage never showed itself better than at
this time. He entered Germany in order to effect an escape and was well
aware of the risks he was running. He thought it would be advisable to
^
leave a " life-line " open to this country, and this precaution took the form
of a simple but ingenious code based on the way he wrote the date on his
letters—2. i. 38 as. compared with 2 January 38 and so on—each form of
writing having its particular meaning. He laughed at this sort of arrange-
ment as being " melodramatic ". Anyhow it was a frightening experience.
Plans for the crossing of the frontier were laid in Frankfurt-am-Main by
Carington, his wife-to-be and the husband of one of her friends. Carington
then lay low in Berlin, living in a room near the Potsdammerplatz, until the
plans matured. What he saw and heard in Berlin during those weeks made
him (who had previously shown little interest in politics) a savagely angry
enemy of National Socialism for the rest of his days.
As for himself, in Berlin, " The mere fact that one did not know [whether
the secret had been uncovered by the authorities] was very wearing—or so
I found. For weeks I was scared stiff whenever I heard a male voice in the
flat {e.g. telephone inspector, gas merchant, postman) fearing that it might
be a Secret Police agent come to interrogate or arrest. And, of course, at
one time I thought there was a distinct possibility of war and being cut off
in hostile country."
Mrs Carington was eventually got across the frontier by a mountain pass
into Czechoslovakia, a journey greatly facilitated by the knowledge and
guidance of her family friend. The latter turned back at the frontier ;
the Caringtons were married in Prague the same day. Mrs Carington's
friend perished in a concentration camp during the war.
The years following this marriage were the most fortunate in Whately
Carington's life, and they also formed his most abundant period as a
psychical research worker. If Carington was the restless worker and
writer, his wife was the adviser, critic and collaborator. On at least one
occasion—in the Paranormal Cognition of Drawings—she was the origina-
tor of an impressive piece of research.
At first they lived in Cambridge, but in 1940 moved to Cornwall.
Carington's health rapidly improved, and for a year or two he felt himself
stronger and his mind more at rest than at any time since he was young.
A holiday spent in the south of France just before the war had also done
him a power of good. Years afterwards he used to look back, with a painful
longing, on one particularly memorable day of that holiday. It was spent
on a quiet, sunny beach, and
—" I hadn't a care or thought in the world . . .
It was the only completely happy day of my life."
1 Obituary 207
Their little cottage stood at the end of Sennen Cove, a stone's throw
from Land's End. There was a cold water supply and electric light (part
of which Carington had fitted up) ; there were no other of the ordinary
requirements of civilisation, but somehow the place had been made com-
fortable, and Mrs Carington's garden in summer was a delight.
Here Whately Carington passed the last years of his life, and most of
those years were spent in his study, which was a small, narrow room with,
at one end, a tiny window that overlooked the Atlantic. He rarely looked
out of the window, in my recollection—the passing show interested him
not at all. (On the other hand, he followed with too much excitement the
progress of the war.) On a vast ex-dining table pushed against the window-
corner were all the tools of his labours—the calculating machine, typewriter,
pens, rubber, multi-coloured inks, index cabinets containing summaries of
thousands of calculations ; and at one side of him, as he sat at his table,
were well-thumbed sets of our own and other Societies' Proceedings.
Round the walls and overflowing into his adjacent bedroom were row upon
row of thick files—they must have numbered about 200—containing com-
plete records of his work in past years.
He worked with extreme care and precision, and treated his data with a
thoroughness that at times seemed more a failing than a virtue. He light-
heartedly excused this on the ground that he was " a pathological per-
fectionist ". Moreover, in psychical research it was a rare experience, he
held, to get a straightforward " Yes " or " No " answer to a question ;
it
was therefore necessary to drag out of the data every particle of information
they could offer—if only as a signpost for further work and for future
investigators. He felt that his elaborate statistical methods were fully
justified by his discovery of the Displacement Eff^ect in the Paranormal
Cognition of Drawings.
To collaborate with Whately Carington was an education in how
psychical research should be done. Nothing but the best one could do
would satisfy him ; and having done one's best he would then propose
improvements. But if he imposed heavy demands on others he was no less
severe on himself. His own criteria were summarised in his own words
—
" We must always remember that the methods of orthodox science are not
necessarily good enough for psychical research." Without such rigorous
standards he would probably never have been able to enlist the co-operation
of the many university psychologists who collaborated with him in the
PNC research.
But the rigorous methods had an account to render. The care taken of
his health allowed him to write, in 1941, " I'm working harder and better
than I have for years ", but in the same letter, " I just can't keep abreast
with what has to be done." From 1942 onwards he worked at an ever
accelerating pace. It had been his custom to work eight hours a day
—
" like an honest working man ". When this proved insufficient he stepped
it up to ten hours, then to twelve, and sometimes until he fell asleep from
exhaustion over his worktable. In his last years he began work about 7.30
in the morning, and never later than 8 o'clock.
He refreshed himself with endless cups of tea—a beverage which he
described as his only remaining pleasure—poured from a half-gallon pot,
which was replenished from time to time during the day. A short rest after
2o8 W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. .. [Part
lunch, then he returned to further calculations, or to deal with his large
correspondence, or to write more pages to whatever manuscript was in
progress at the time. Most of his own experiments were carried out at
night in collaboration with his wife.
The sense of urgency grew more intense each year. " Time is so short,"
he would exclaim. When advised to rest he retorted, " No, I must work
and / must work, for the time cometh when no man shall work." The
awards of the Perrott Studentship and later a Leverhulme Research
Fellowship gave him deep pleasure. Perversely, those marks of recognition
contributed to his worries, for his high sense of responsibility was always
at the mercy of his nervous temperament, and the fear of failure (to fulfil
his undertakings) was very real to him.
Yet it was in such circumstances that he produced two papers by which
his name will be best remembered hereafter. The first was the highly
technical paper called " Steps in the Development of a Repeatable Tech-
nique ", {Proc. A.S.P.R. vol. 24). The construction of an experiment that
would meet one of the prime requirements of all scientific work, namely
one which could be repeated at any time with approximately similar
results on each occasion, had long been Carington's aim in psychical re-
search, and he considered that his Frequency-Catalogue invention fully
met such requirements. He conceded to critics that the method would
require amendment, but he felt that it was fundamentally sound. The
preparation of the catalogue, which occupies some thirty pages of the
report, entailed the re-examination of the work of 741 percipients and the
individual examination of 10,006 drawings. The mere physical labour
alone was monstrous, it occupied Carington for many months, and during
the whole of this time his wife was seriously ill.
It would be a mistake to think of him as always borne down by duty and
anxiety. He had periods of gaiety when his infectious laughter would
involve the whole company. He was not a great talker—the reading of a
paper at the S.P.R. was invariably an ordeal to him—but he was a witty
and lively conversationalist. He had a genuine humour, for at times he
would joke at his own misfortunes. He was the perfect host, for in him
" the desire to please " had no known limits.
The conception and development of the Association Theory of Psychical
Phenomena was the cause of much lively correspondence. (The theory
was set forth in Proc. vol. 47, and forms the second of the two papers
mentioned above.) One was forewarned to look out for the draft of a
paper, " in which I propose to plunge into theory feet first with a loud
splash, and try to produce one which is applicable not only to PNC but
(in outline) to practically the whole range of psychic phenomena." The
paper was duly received, and was returned to him accompanied by some
minor suggestions and a word of doubt about the " flippancy " of some of
his paragraphs. To this he characteristically replied
—" To a certain ex-
tent this kind of thing is natural to me ; but also it is part of a deliberate
policy of debunking, and of a refusal to be intimidated by pundits or by the
profundities and awe-inspiringness of the subject. Unlike Kant, I refuse
to be cowed either by the Immensity of the Starry Heavens or by the
Moral Sense in Man. There ain't no moral sense in man that I can see
—
at least not as K meant it—and I see nothing reverential in being large, hot.

distant and unintelligent. An onion is much more interesting and
important than a star ..."
Few men can have written so many letters enlivened with so much gusto.
'
Often the words jump and dance on the page. Some of this vitality comes
out in the best of his published works, expecially The Death of Materialism
(a gorgeous book, surely) and in Telepathy. Most of the latter was written
I at breakneck speed—sixty thousand words in three weeks. When he got
the book off to the publisher he wrote, " Got book off yesterday after
violent spurt, which approximately killed me." He immediately flung
himself with unrestrained intensity into further analysis of PNC drawings,
and abruptly broke off a letter with the exclamation that something was
" suddenly becoming frightfully exciting." This was an examination of
the scores of women as compared with men. Three days later there fol-
lowed an apologetic postcard pleading, " You know how it is when some
new finding beckons." The feverish pace had always to be paid for, and a
few weeks later he wrote
—" I can neither work nor relax properly ... I feel
as if some super-vampire had sucked all my blood out and left me pallid and
deflated, as an eviscerated flounder."
Occasionally he would be persuaded to rest, perhaps for a week or so ;
but the best form of relief he found was in " tinkering " old motor bicycles.
One ancient machine he fitted with a four-cylinder engine, reconditioning
every part with meticulous care, and eventually he drove it along the
Cornish roads at 90 m.p.h. He found that working with his hands for a
couple of hours every afternoon did him a lot of good.
It was once suggested to him that in order to moderate the strain of
unceasing psychical research and also to improve his financial position, he
might seriously consider engaging part of his time in some other form of
occupation. During a walk round the cliffs near Land's End he brought
the matter up and said quite suddenly (and with apparent seriousness)
—
" I wonder if I could be a successful grocer." It happened that I had
lately heard of a distinguished poet who had in fact run a grocer's shop.
Carington had to be told all details (which were few) but at the story's
denouement when the poet-grocer was declared insolvent for £1000,
Carington stopped in his tracks in a state of uncontrollable mirth. He
presently said something about the cobbler and his last, and with utter
finality
—" I will not be a grocer!
"
It should, I think, be recorded here that the subject of this memoir was
invited to offer himself as a candidate for a post of great distinction in a
University. The invitation did not come from any quarter that might be
described as " psychical research " but from the academic world. It is
safe to say that no other proposal in his career had so deeply moving an
effect as this. He thought about it a little, and reluctantly turned himself
from it. On speaking of this soon afterwards he tried rather haltingly to
educe reasons why so golden an opportunity was impossible to pursue.
Some of his objections were not perhaps without substance, but for the
most part they were excuses and rationalisations rather than strong
reasons. The matter was soon closed. He glanced round his study,
saying
—" And what would happen to all this? " That was all that need
be said, for " all this " was psychical research.
He shared the views of W. E. Gladstone that psychical research " is
210 W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part
the most important work which is being done in the world—by far the most
important." But Carington knew (what the statesman perhaps never sus-
pected) that " psychical research is probably the most intricate subject
with which the human intellect has ever grappled." The intricacies might
sometimes dismay him. His own discoveries might yield at times little
more than an ever-expanding world of complexities to which there seemed
no end ; then he would feel himself " wobbling all the time on the edge of
a nervous breakdown." (And, " I wish to god I hadn't so much to do.")
He might be shaken to the roots of his being by the discovery of " three
months work wasted through a mistake." (" Hell! I'd give a leg to be
able to quit and rest for a year.") He might feel—as he often did when
working his hardest
—" pretty lousy " and " finance very gloomy, though
something may turn up " ; but when he had achieved his nadir of frustra-
tion he would take refuge in self-mockery. " Pray for my soul, or modern
equivalent " on one occasion, and on another, " Unless I get to some sort
of stopping place in my present abominable labours first, I shall start having
kittens in public."
And yet how often he would exclaim with pride and self-assurance,
" I am a man of incomparable psychological resilience." Or how pleased
he would be when work turned out better than expected, as at the close of
the collaborative PK investigation, published after his death, " I seem to
have got more out of it than, to be quite frank, I at one time thought was
in it."
For all the trials and the bitter disillusionments that the work sometimes
imposed, it never seems to have occurred to him to turn his energies to
other and more profitable scientific fields—though for such work he was
superbly, lavishly endowed. Psychical research was his chosen calling—
•
and was it not " the most important work ... in the world?
"
The last year of his life was on the whole the most contented and satis-
fying that he had known for many years. His book Telepathy had passed
through three editions and was being translated into foreign languages, and
he had two new books on the stocks. The long PNC work had drawn to a
close, and its place had been taken by some fresh and exciting PK ex-
periments initiated by Mrs Carington. Most important of all his wife's
health had improved greatly ; and though his too-active mind would con-
tinue to deny him rest, still on the whole he felt more at ease—though often
" tired ". He and his wife would enjoy travelling about Cornwall on their
reconditioned motor-cycles.
He seldom walked about the countryside. His shyness was such that he
feared contact with his neighbours. On a visit, he was persuaded to take
me to see the Sennen lifeboat. Coming out of the boathouse (about fifty
yards from his cottage) he passed the seated fishermen without a word or
look. I stopped and made the conventional remarks one is liable to make
on such occasions. When I had overtaken him along the road he said in
words that were almost a whisper, " Did you speak to them? " " Yes.".
" I couldn't do that." Then, having raised the subject he quickly and
gladly dropped it.
In dress he preferred comfort before appearance, and his favourite
clothes were a pair of ancient grey slacks, a much-loved brown sports jacket,
and an open-necked shirt. He could say that he had not used a collar or tie
174] Obituary 211
for five years ; he rarely wore any headgear and his thin and prematurely
white hair blew easily in the wind. Whately Carington was always Whately
Carington and none other. According to his own account he was regarded
by the Cornish people as " a harmless eccentric crank "—harmless because
he interfered with no one. In some sense he " liked " the people
—
especially the " ordinary " people—but he never knew them. Yet no one
was more eager to lend a helping hand when needed, and his acts of kind-
ness were many. He was therefore liked and respected ; in the words of
an old fisherman
—" He was a foine gintleman . . . We alius liked un."
A rumour that he " dabbled in the occult " and " consorted with
spirits " was never confirmed, and on the whole it was assumed that he
lived in the Cove for the benefit of his health. That the recluse of Ommen
Cottage worked and slaved three thousand hours a year on research was not
known.
The last year he spent in the writing of two books, Survival, which re-
mains a fragment, and Matter, Mind and Meaning, which he judged his
magnum opus. Of this he had written two-thirds at the time of his death.
The book has been edited and prepared for publication by Professor
H. H. Price.
In past years the Society has often had to mourn the death of dis-
tinguished members at the height of their intellectual powers. Gurney
died at the age of 41, Hodgson at 50, Podmore at 55, Myers at 57. Caring-
ton died at 54, and his loss is to be measured not only by what he achieved
—which was large enough—but what he still had in him, awaiting only the
creative act. He believed that his Association Theory offered a sufficient
explanation of a wide range of psychic phenomena. The theory might
eventually require amendment (perhaps extensively) but for the present
it brought order out of chaos. Nevertheless the creation of a theory was
not enough to satisfy its creator. Psychical research was not an end in
itself.
It was necessary to build a new metaphysic. Ninety per cent of all
philosophy had outlived its usefulness ; hence the time had come, he
wrote, to " construct a genuine metaphysic from first principles ... of
which all physics and all psychology will be derivatives. That might con-
ceivably be done by processes of pure thought without reference to facts
at all [i.e. by purely epistemological methods)—I'm not at all sure . . . but
if we are to use facts at all, we must take cognisance of all (types of) facts,
so-called paranormal as well as normal. It is futile to talk about " reality
"
and ignore hallucinations, veridical and otherwise ; or . . . about time and
ignore precognition ; or cognition generally and ignore P.N.C." He there-
fore planned " a tentative essay ... to be entitled something like '
Attempt
at Thinking—with special reference to Apparitions, Normal Cognition,
Precognition and Psychokinesis '." The projected essay was abandoned,
its place taken by the unfinished Matter, Mind and Meaning, the most
ambitious creative work he had ever attempted.
At Christmas 1946 he and his wife were preparing their departure for
Provence where they intended to live permanently. Carington was press-
ing forward with the writing of his book, when he was suddenly stricken
with partial blindness of both eyes. He could read no more. In the weeks
that followed his strength steadily fell, and a brief visit to hospital proved
212 ^. W. Whately Carington, M.Sc. [Part 174]
unavailing. Of death he had no fear. His great regret was at leaving work
unfinished ; his only anxiety was that in the faltering of consciousness that
might come upon him before the end, he might recant or in some way
modify his strongly held convictions regarding the destiny of the Mind.
He accordingly prepared, and signed, a statement which was written down
for him by his wife :
I should like to make it clear that, speaking within a few days of my
probable death, my views on Survival are substantially those set out
in the relevant sections of my book Telepathy. That is to say : it
is my firm intellectual conviction that Conscious Existence does
not terminate with the death of the body, though the form it takes
is unlikely, in my judgement, to be closely similar to any of those
commonly accepted.

His mind remained strong and clear to the end. Towards the close of
February the Society at its annual meeting adopted a resolution of sym-
pathy for him in his illness. When the letter containing this news was read
to him he was too weak to speak but on hearing words concerning his
" brilliant and original contributions " to psychical research he smiled
with evident happiness—the kind of smile that always lit up his features in
moments of intensest pleasure.
On the following morning, the 2nd of March, he was dead, soon after
sunrise, and two days later he was buried with Spartan simplicity, in the
churchyard which overlooks the Atlantic near Land's End.
RANDOM SELECTORS FOR E.S.P. EXPERIMENTS
R. Wilson.
, Abstract
In this paper is considered the use of random selectors for experiments in
Extra-Sensory Perception. The fundamental principles upon which the
operation of random selectors depends are discussed ; selectors devised by
previous workers in the field are criticised in the light of these principles,
and a new machine which overcomes many of the disadvantages is de-
scribed. Another machine to this design is being constructed for the
S.P.R. Council ; it employs a reliable electronic valve circuit to select one
of four lamps, though the same type of selector can be designed to select
one of any number of lamps.
Automatic counting of the scores in an E.S.P. experiment is described,
and various precautions against false counts are enumerated.
Introduction
In statistical experiments in E.S.P. one of the most important features
of the experimental technique is the method of obtaining a random
sequence of cards. Unless the sequence is random, the use of statistics
based on the assumption of randomness is invalid. Shuffling cards has its
limitations : the shuffling must be very thorough, the pack of cards large,
and precautions must be taken against fraud. Soal (Soal 1940 ; 1943)
used preselected numbers, a method which necessitates additional pre-
cautions against fraud and is in any case open to objection when used for
precognition or clairvoyance experiments. His alternative of using
counters drawn form a bag is tedious and open to the same objections.
If a method of selecting the cards is used in which the probabilities for
the various cards are not equal, it is possible to use Stevens' method (Soal
1940) to obtain the chance expectation, whereby the material supplies its
own probability. But it is still essential, for the statistics to be valid, that
the probability of any event occurring is independent of any previous
events. This is not true of the average human selector (Tyrrell 1936).
Tyrrell also showed that it is not true for the conventional pack of E.S.P.
cards if it is of a finite size. In this paper it will be shown that the principal
difficulty in devising a satisfactory mechanical selector is to ensure this
independence the importance of which especially in precognition experi-
ments, is obvious.
A machine that can produce reliably and quickly a random sequence
which can be conveniently used for these experiments is therefore an
asset. This has been the goal of two experimenters, (Tyrrell 1936 ;
Redmayne 1940), who both describe electrical machines. A machine which
is electrical in operation is most convenient, because a single such machine
can be made suitable for operation under various experimental conditions
(telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, etc.) and the conditions may even
213
214 R. Wilson [Part
be varied during the course of a single experiment. It also facilitates auto-
matic recording of results.
A simple and ingenious machine for testing E.S.P. has been devised by
Parsons (1946) ; this uses counters, and the random selection is obtained
by shaking them together in a bottle. It is an improvement over the
ordinary technique only for clairvoyance experiments.
Rhine has stated in great detail the requirements he considers essential
for an E.S.P. machine (Rhine 1939). In this paper he suggests that the
random selector is the most difEcult part of the machine to design. This
accords with the writer's experience. Rhine's conditions, which include
provision for the recording of every light selected and every guess, and
counters which reset to zero and stop the machine after a " run " of 25
trials, are considered by the writer to be too extravagant. Though un-
doubtedly desirable, they are expensive luxuries, and are therefore regret-
fully discarded. They may easily be connected at a later date if thought
necessary.
Merritt has described an automatic card shuffler for use in clairvoyance
tests (Merritt 1939).
A selector which has produced 100,000 random numbers has been con-
structed by Kendall (Kendall 1938 ; 1939). This uses a continuously
rotating disc, divided into ten equal sectors inscribed with the numbers
0-9. One of the sectors was illuminated intermittently by a neon lamp.
The number illuminated on each occasion was written down by an ob-
server. This introduces an undesirable subjective element into the
operation of the apparatus ; one result is that with some observers, a truly
random sequence is not obtained. Also, automatic recording is not possible
with this apparatus. Both of these factors make the machine, as it stands,
unsuitable for E.S.P. experiments, but the selection itself is based upon
sound principles.
Tyrrell's selector consists of a Post Office Uniselector Switch, in which a
contact arm traverses in turn each of twenty-five contacts. These are
wired in five groups of five, since a selection of only five lamps is required.
The supply current to the traversing ratchet is cut off by hand at ar random
instant. The selection of the switch contact to remain in circuit when the
ratchet mechanism stops, is random, if the time of traversal of the several
contacts be equal. (Inequalities tend to cancel, since there are five contacts
for each circuit.)
Redmayne's machine incorporates a motor-driven rotary selector with
five vanes mounted at equal distances round the periphery. The selector
is stopped at a random time by an attracting electro-magnet, and an
electrical contact made to one of the five vanes. In addition to the random
variation in time, Redmayne varies the speed of his motor.
Tyrrell's and Redmayne's machines have their disadvantages also.
Tyrrell's is not portable, and both use batteries. Redmayne's will not
operate at the high speed required for use in some precognition experi-
ments (Soal 1940 ; 1943) ; it will be shown later that the randomness of
Tyrrell's machine is very dependent upon the regularity with which the key
is depressed, especially at high speeds of operation. It may therefore work
satisfactorily with some operators but not with others. Also machines con-
structed by others on apparently identical principles have failed to reach
174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 215
the same high standard possessed by the prototypes. This is unfortunate,
because it makes one doubt whether the prototype is reliable under all
conditions of operation, and continuous checking during the course of an
experiment is rendered desirable.
The need for a reliable machine is apparent : a desirable attribute is that
of easy detection and repair of faults.
If the sequence fails to be random because of some fault, it is desirable
that the departure from the randomness should be sufficiently great to be-
come immediately obvious. To design a machine with these features it is
first necessary to examine in detail the factors which cause a departure from
randomness.
General Theory of Random Selectors
All the Random Number Selectors considered in this paper work on the
following basic principle :
A mechanical or electrical system traverses, in rapid succession, a num-
ber of distinct " states ", each state potentially representing the lighting of
a corresponding lamp. The traversal may be by means of a motor-driven
rotary switch, or by an electronic valve circuit. The " cyclical period ", or
the time taken for all the states to be traversed once, depends on the speed
of the driving motor (in the case of a rotary switch) or on the frequency of
the oscillator (in the case of a valve circuit), and may if desired be made
randomly variable.
The driving motor (or oscillator etc.) is switched on and off every few
seconds, either at regular or at random intervals. The state of the system
at the instant of switching off determines the lamp to be lit. A guess is then
made by the percipient in an E.S.P. experiment, the machine automatically
recording the success or otherwise of the guess, and the motor is switched
on again in preparation for the next selection. If the lamp is to be randomly
selected, either the cyclical period, or the running time of the motor (or
oscillator), or both, must be random. The conditions of randomness are
discussed in detail in Appendix I.
The problem is to convert a randomness in time into a randomness of
selection of the lamp to be lit. If there are several cycles during which all
the states are traversed before the motor is switched off, and the running
time of the motor is made sufficiently irregular with respect to successive
selections, the selection will be practically random. Theoretically an in-
finite number of cycles would be necessary for perfect randomness ; in
practice, however, a perfectly random sequence is not required. So long
as the effect to be observed is large in comparison with the deviations from
randomness, some small preferences, either for individual lamps, or for
particular sequences of lamps, can be tolerated.
It is shown in Appendix I that too great a cyclical period {i.e. too low a
motor speed) or too short a running time, gives rise to sequence preferences.
For a I per cent deviation from randomness, it is shown that t, the cyclical
period, must not be greater than 0-12 AT, where AT is the " spread " of
the running time T, and is a measure of the randonmess of T. For a five
per cent deviation, t must not exceed 0-27 AT.
It would be difficult for a percipient in an E.S.P. experiment to take ad-
vantage of sequence preferences, which are difficult to detect unless they
2l6 R. Wilson [Part
are very prominent. Probably, therefore, a sequence preference of the
order of five per cent should not introduce error provided that the per-
centage of " true cognitions " is of the same or higher order. It is best,
however, to be on the safe side and reduce the cyclical period as much as
possible.
It remains to be seen how we can achieve in practice the required spread
in T. It is difficult to make a device that fulfils the condition quoted and
at the same time is sufficiently reliable. A device which is reliable in
operation is usually also consistent in its timing and therefore has a low
value of " spread ". This applies particularly to electronic switching
methods.
*
The reader should clearly distinguish the time-scales involved here.
The rapid succession of states, which may occur many times per second,
are best produced electronically ; it is difiicult to control electronically the
timing of the making of the selection, which occurs only once every few
seconds.
Three devices seem to have been in use in the past. Tyrrell used a
manual method : the time T was the time that a key was held down
—
i.e.
was of the order of ^ sec. In estimating the efficacy of this method, the
most unfavourable condition must be postulated ; that in which the ex-
perimenter endeavours to make the times during which the key is held
down in successive trials as nearly as possible equal. Experiments on
response times (Woodworth 1939) indicate that this method may give a
value for AT zs low as x&th sec. It is clear that this is too small to give an
adequately random selection with Tyrrell's Machine, for which t is xffth
sec. An alternative method, which improves the position slightly, is to take
for T not the time of holding down the key but the time between the
operation of the trial recorder for the previous guess, and the time the key
is pressed for the new selection. This method is used in the writer's
machine, giving a time T of the order of a second or more.
A fully automatic method is used by Redmayne. He uses the variability
in the time of heating up of a Thermal Delay Switch to produce the varia-
tion A T, in conjunction with two relays for resetting. The relays and the
Thermal Delay Switch turn each other on and off with a period determined
by the heating time. The particular type of switch used (Bulgin) is rather
erratic in its action, especially when adjusted to give a short repetition time.
This produces a large " spread ", but in the writer's experience at the cost
of reliability. It is liable to flicker at the moment of making or breaking
contact ; with high-speed recorders there is a possibility of double counts.
While adequate for Redmayne's purposes, it would be unsuitable for
operation at a higher speed.
Alternative types of Thermal Delay Switch which are free from this
defect do not give a sufficiently high value of " spread ".
One relay could if desired be replaced by a contact operated by the Trial
Counter, so that the Repetition Time could be adjusted automatically to the
percipient's requirements without the advantages of automatic control
being lost.
Kendall's method probably gives the highest value for AT. The time
T is the time taken for a condenser to charge to a given value (the flashing
potential of a neon lamp). The charging resistance is a crisscross of pencil
174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 217
lines on a piece of paper ; the circuit is not completed till the operator
touches the pencil lines with a metallic pointer. As he moves the pointer
across the paper, the charging resistance varies in a random manner, and
produces the required variation AT m the charging time.
This method is, however, tedious to operate and, therefore, unsuitable
for E.S.P. investigation.
Another alternative, which the writer intends to try, is to use a contact
operated by a clock. The type suggested is the Air Ministry type contactor
master type 2 (10A/10994). It makes a contact once per second for about
I second, and seems to give a " spread " of i/50th sec., which is adequate
when used in conjunction with a sufficiently low cyclical period.
Random Variation in Motor Speed
If the switching time T remained absolutely regular [i.e. AT=o), and
the cyclical period (and motor speed) were made to vary in a random
fashion, a random sequence would still be obtained. The cyclical period
would still have to be small in comparison with the interval T. We require
that the mean cyclical period, as measured over a time interval T, should
have no correlation with the mean cyclical period measured during the
interval T immediately succeeding. This requires a motor to be accelerated
and retarded many times during the interval T, and this condition Red-
mayne's machine does not fulfil. If this were the only factor in Redmayne's
machine producing randomness, very strong sequence preferences could
be expected.
If an electronic valve circuit is used, a random variation of cyclical
period might be obtained in one of several ways. A simple method would
be to amplify the random voltages produced by thermal fluctuation in a
high resistance or by a noise valve. Such a source has been used to simu-
late the random pulses which cause interference in radio sets (Licklider
1947). An alternative, which would probably prove less reliable, is to use
the pulses obtained from a Geiger counter when counting the rays from
some radioactive material. This has been suggested as a method of obtain-
ing a random sample from a collection of punched cards (Vickery 1939).
Both are fundamentally good ways of obtaining a random sequence ;
the
former depends upon the random motion of a large sample of molecules
and electrons (of the order of lo^^), and the latter depends upon the un-
certainty of radioactive decay. But caution should be observed : it is
possible, by observing a random sequence in the wrong way, for it to appear
to be a regular sequence. This occurs when the resolving time of the scaling
circuit or the band-width of the amplifier is inadequate. The matter is dis-
cussed fully by Fiirth and MacDonald (1947). Nuclear physicists often
have a suitable apparatus already set up, and the writer has verified that
such a system works well, and because of its great flexibility uses it for
demonstrating the principles of these devices.
Changeover Time
Another important detail to be considered is the time taken by the
machine to change from one " state " to the next. There is a short tinie
when the machine is, as it were, poised between two states ;
if the motor is
2l8 R. Wilson [Part
stopped at that instant, there may be uncertainty as to which of the lamps
is to be Ht. If this time varies sHghtly as between different pairs of states,
and the variation is comparable with the cyclical period, then departure
from randomness will be observed {e.g. one lamp will be. selected more
frequently than others). This effect occurs in all selectors from Roulette
Wheels onwards. During the changeover time the factors which otherwise
determine the selection of the lamp are small, so that the selection may be
affected by extraneous factors, such as irregularities of construction, the
inertia of the motor and apparatus, etc.
The concept is most easily understood by reference to a particular
machine, for example in Redmayne's type.
Fig. I
Suppose the five vanes occupy 60° of the circle each, so that there is 12°
of insulation between each pair. Then, if at the instant when the attracting
magnet stops the rotation of the selector, the magnet is over the insulator,
we cannot predict which lamp will be selected, since this will be affected
critically by small inequalities of the system. The effect will be further
considered below in connection with the writer's machine.
The Writer's Electronic Selector
The writer's Selector makes use of an electronic valve circuit, extensively
used in Nuclear Physics, called a Scaling Circuit. There are several types,
with various complications and frills, but basically the operation is simple.
The circuit has a number of positions of stable equilibrium, determined by
whether certain valves conduct heavily or not at all ; but on application of
an external pulse the circuit changes to the next position.
In Nuclear Physics the circuits are used to produce one output pulse for
every, say, eight or ten, input pulses. This will occur whatever the rate of
arrival of the input pulses. It is used in particular for counting random
pulses which are arriving too fast to actuate directly a mechanical counter.
Interpolating lamps are often arranged to indicate the intermediate
positions of the circuit.
In the Selector built by the writer, the input pulses are of constant fre-
quency and are provided by a Transitron oscillator. They are then applied
through a switch to a Scaling Circuit with four states (a " Scale of 4
Counter "), with four interpolating lamps. The oscillator is disconnected
from the scaling circuit at a random instant by pressing a " Selector Key ".
174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 219
The scaling circuit remains in the state in which it happens to be at the
instant of pressing the Selector Key, and the corresponding lamp lights.
A scale of four counter is used in preference to a scale of five (the number
five being traditional in E.S.P. experiments) because the electronic circuit
involved is simpler. Reliable circuits have, however, been devised for any
number of states (Lifschutz 1940). It might be an advantage to have a
larger number of choices than four, to decrease the chance successes, but
there would be a tendency to lose the motor response which makes this
type of experiment successful. In view of the increased complexity of an
increased number, it was not considered worth while to make provision for
this.
The oscillator frequency used is 3200 pulses per second. With four
lamps, the cyclical period is i /800th sec. and therefore a spread AT oi
i/200th sec. or more should produce a random sequence. The spread of
i/ioth sec. given by hand operation, or i/soth sec. given by the Air
Ministry contactor, should be satisfactory.
The changeover time is the time taken for a valve to pass from the
non-conducting to the fully conducting state. It cannot be greater than
the width of the pulse from the transitron, which, after sharpening, is of
the order of 10^^ seconds. This is negligible in comparison with the cyclical
period i /800th sec.
The circuit is described fully in Appendix II.
Another Possible Method of Random Selection
Another method of obtaining a random selection electronically was tried
by the writer. Four biassed back thyratrons were arranged to be triggered
respectively by the phases of a four-phase A.C. supply. The phase
which happens to be the most positive at the instant of switching on,
triggers the corresponding thyratron and lights a lamp.
This method was rejected because of the high changeover time, which
renders the circuit unduly sensitive to changes in bias voltage, and so pro-
duces departures from randomness.
Operation in E.S.P. Experiments
The operation of an electrical E.S.P. machine is quite simple. A de-
scription of the operation of the writer's machine is given, but each type
has its own peculiarities.
The Selector is in a small portable box which contains also the recording
counters. The lamps are in a separate box on the end of a short lead from
the Selector. This box can be covered for use in clairvoyance tests, or
observed by an agent in telepathy tests. Over each lamp can be placed a
transparency bearing an appropriate symbol : cross, square, etc.
The percipient has a " Guess-Box " connected by a long lead to the
Selector Box. On this box are mounted the four " Guess Keys " and the
" Selector Key ". The keys used in the prototype are telephone jack
switches, but button switches are to be used in the model under construction
for the S.P.R. The Guess-Box should be operated at a distance from the
Selector, and the same precautions taken against hyperaesthesia etc. as in
220 R. Wilson [Part
other E.S.P. experiments. The experimenter should not relax his caution .|
because he is using a machine.
The machine takes about thirty seconds to warm up, after which it
should be tested for randomness over ten or fifteen trials. Any defect
should be instantly observable at this stage : a failure of a valve, for ex-
ample, cause a complete breakdown, e.g. a failure of two of the lamps to be
selected at all. A fault leading to only slight " preferences " is almost im-
possible with this machine.
Before starting a run of trials, any one of the Guess Keys is pressed, so
setting the Selector in operation. The two Recording Counters are then
read. The percipient presses the Selector Key, which makes a random
selection, and lights one of the four lamps. He then presses one of the four
Guess Keys, to guess which lamp is lit. The Counters automatically
count the number of guesses and the number of successes. The percipient
continues, alternately pressing the Selector Key and one of the Guess Keys
till the end of the run, when the counters are again read giving the result
of the experiment.
If it is desired to count a definite number, say twenty-five, of guesses,
the experimenter must watch the trial counter and stop the percipient or
switch off the machine when sufficient guesses have been made. It is a
major disadvantage of the machine that no automatic provision is made for
this. In telepathy tests the agent sees the lamp selected by the machine
but plays no active role.
It is possible for the experimenter to alter certain conditions during the
run, e.g. to cover up the lamp box in order to change from telepathy to
clairvoyance conditions without the percipient being aware of the fact by
any normal means. .
Precognition Tests t
«
For experiments in precognition, one switch is changed on the Selector
Box, and another on the Guess-Box ; these cut out the Selector Key and
the selection is then made by auxiliary contacts on the Guess Keys. Since
the key has to be pressed by the percipient before the selection is made by
the machine, the guess is before the event and is truly precognitive. The
only possible alternative to precognition in producing correct guesses
would seem to be a P.K. faculty influencing the selection.
Clairvoyance Tests
For tests in absolute clairvoyance, it is desirable that no indication of the
selection be made to any person at any time, in order that the possibility
of precognitive telepathy (as suggested by Tyrrell) may be eliminated.
It is held by some that no indication even as to which particular guesses
are successful should be given, and the machine is therefore designed to
record only the total number of trials and of successes in a series.
Unfortunately, the Success Counter used at present is somewhat noisy
in action, although the sound is partially swamped by the simultaneous
operation of the Trials Counter, and still gives an auditory indication of
success. A more silent counter might be employed ; but the only real safe-
guard is to ensure that the counters are at a considerable distance from any-
174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 221
one. A morse inker or other device recording individual guesses (as used
by Tyrrell) is inadmissible.
Precautions against False Counts '
Redmayne has considered possible causes of false counts in fair detail.
His device for preventing two keys from being pressed simultaneously has
been adopted by the writer. This is a Trip Relay, which is of higher
speed than the Counters, and which operates on a current of 10 mA., but
not on 5 mA. When one key is pressed, a current of 5 mA. is passed through
the relay ; when two keys are pressed simultaneously, 10 mA. is passed
through the relay, which therefore trips, and the Trip Relay Meter registers.
The run in progress must then be discarded ; this usually occurs the first
time the percipient has operated the machine, so unfortunately terminal
salience effects may be missed. A Trip Relay Reset Key is provided on the
Selector Box to reset the instrument for the next run.
After each guess the oscillator is automatically reconnected and the
supply voltage to the Counters cut off, so that only one guess can be made
for each selection. When an attempt is made to record a guess before the
Selector Key has been pressed, the Trial Counter will operate but the
Success Counter will not. This is an unfortunate feature of the apparatus,
since it will reduce the proportion of recorded successes ; but it is an
error on the right side, and it would require an additional relay to avoid it.
Redmayne provides a device for precognitive trials to prevent guesses
being made more frequently than one every two seconds. This is not
necessary in the writer's machine, because the hysteresis of the relay con-
tacts prevents the oscillator from being connected for less than i/50th sec.
This represents some sixteen cyclic periods, which is sufficient to ensure
randomness. This is another advantage of the high oscillator frequency.
Another possibility, not specifically mentioned by Redmayne, is that the
Guess Key might " make " the various contacts at slightly different times ;
thus, by pressing the key only lightly, it might be possible to operate the
Success Counter and not the Trial Counter, or not to operate the Trip
Relay contact. In order to obviate this possibility, the Guess Key contacts
have been arranged to operate in the following order : {a) Trip Relay con-
tact ;
{b) contact making selection (in precognition tests only) ;
(c) contact
connecting the Success Counter to the appropriate circuit ; and {d) the
contact actuating (simultaneously) the two counters. The order {b) or (c)
is inimaterial.
It is inVportant that the Trial Counter should not take longer to operate
than the Success Counter, otherwise, again, it might be possible, by flicking
the key quickly, to operate the Success Counter and not the Trial Counter.
Results so far Obtained
Various percipients have been tested for various forms of E.S.P. with
this machine. The writer scored significantly at first but the effect de-
clined to zero after 4,000 trials. Two others have given strong positive re-
sults. All these experiments have been exploratory : the precautions
against false counts were not all in operation when they were carried out.
222 R. Wilson [Part
Further experiments with the same, percipients will be carried out as
opportunity occurs.
Some statistical tests of the randomness of the machine are given in
Appendix III.

Mathematical Analysis of the Conditions for Randomness
Suppose the system changes from one state to the next times per second.
If there are n states, each state is traversed — times per second, so that the
n
n
cyclical period ^ = Suppose the time the motor is running for each
selection is T seconds.
Then during the time T the system will have changed its state p times,
where p is the nearest integer below TN. It will come to rest at the ^'th
state, where q is the remainder after dividing p by n.
Now if T is the same for each trial, the lamps will come on in regular
sequence, each time moving to the ^'th lamp counting from the lamp lit in
the previous trial. For a random selection, T must be slightly different for
successive trials. Suppose that the frequency of occurrence of a value T
is distributed about a nriean value T with a Gaussian distribution. (This is
a reasonable approximation and a convenient way of specifying numerically
the spread of the values : but it is not valid if the spread is of the order of T
itself.)
The frequency V is then given by an equation j =3^0 . e~(^~^)*/''\
Let the width of this curve for values of y at half the maximum he AT :
then we require zl T to be large compared with t, in order that the proba-
bilities of q having values from i to « may be equal to within the required
accuracy. If this is so, the probabilities of selection of the several states
will be equal.
This analysis assumes that each value of q is obtained from one range of
values of T at the top of the error curve. In fact each value of q can be
obtained from a number of ranges of values of T distributed on either side
of the error curve ; but provided that the above condition is satisfied, the
ranges on opposite sides of the curve will roughly cancel each other in their
effects, and the method therefore gives a sufficiently close approximation
for our present purpose.
The value of T for half maximum is given by putting y/y^ = \ . This
gives {T-Xy^a^ AoggZ.
i.e. {ATjzy = log,2 .

174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 223
The total spread is twice this expression, so we want / to be less than 0-12
A T. Similarly for a 5 per cent inequality we require t to be less than
0-27 AT.
Effect of failure to comply with this Condition
If T be absolutely constant, there will be a sequence of lamps, say 1425
314253... The Selector will show a definite sequence habit, or, in a
special case, just repeat the same lamp. If J T is too low, a deviation from
randomness will be observed, in the form of sequence preferences. There
will be a tendency to shift from one sequence to another : thus, with four
lamps, we might have 131312424313242413134...
This will clearly lead to the same mean expectation for each lamp as a
purely random sequence ; the standard deviation will, however, be
increased. ,
.
APPENDIX II
Description of the Circuit of the Writer's Machine
The scaling circuit used in the prototype (Fig. ii) uses a pentode trigger
pair (Reich 1938). Vi, a transitron oscillator, generates negative pulses at
the suppressor grid, which are sharpened by the differentiator circuit C3
R6, giving a pulse-width of about 2 micro-seconds, and a " time of rise
"
of less than \ micro-second. They are then fed through a contact of the
relay P3 to the grids of the first trigger pair V2 V3. These are so biassed
that only one of the two valves can conduct : an input pulse cuts off both
valves, and at the end of the input pulse the valve which was originally
non-conducting draws current, and the two valves have changed places.
The pair has been " triggered ". At the next input pulse, the pair triggers
back again.
At alternate input pulses, therefore, positive and negative pulses are
passed to the next trigger pair V4V5. The positive pulses have no effect,
but the negative pulses trigger the pair.
The trigger valves V2V3V4V5 operate the lamps through the relays
P1P2. The relays cannot be inserted directly into the trigger circuits
without upsetting the operation, so an isolating valve V6 is incorporated.
It will be seen that there are four states of stable equilibrium of the sys-
tem, and the following cycle of events occurs on receipt of successive input
pulses.
Initially V2 V4 conduct ; Pi off, P2 off.
After I St pulse V3 V4 conduct ; Pi on, P2 off.
After 2nd pulse V2 V5 conduct ; Pi off, P2 on.
After 3rd pulse V3 V5 conduct ; Pi on, P2 on.
After the fourth pulse the system returns to the original state. By the
arrangement of relay contacts shown, each state corresponds to the lighting
of one indicator lamp.
When the oscillator is connected to the Scaling Circuit, the relays cannot
follow the rapid change of state. To prevent a buzz, which wears out the
relay contacts, condensers Cjg, are placed across the relays.
174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 225
On de-energising P3, the contact is broken, and the oscillator is discon-
nected from the Scaling Circuit, which remains in the state in which it hap-
pens to be at the instant of breaking contact, and the appropriate lamp is
selected. During the time that the Scaling Circuit is changing its state, it
is undesirable that any lamp should be lit, and the lamps and counters
are therefore switched off by means of another contact of P3.
The power pack is conventional, and in addition to supplying L.T. and
H.T. for the valves, supplies 35 v. D.C. for the counters and lamps, by
connection of a rectifier between the taps in the primary of the mains
transformer. .
Guessing and Recording Circuit
The switches S^, S2, S3, S4 are the four Guess Keys. Each has four con-
tacts A, B, C, D. These are adjusted to work in the order A, B or C. D,
Switch S5, the Selector Key, has two contacts, A and B, which operate in
that order.
Contact A of all five switches operates the trip relay P4. This relay is
adjusted so that it will trip with a resistance oi i \ kw. in series but not with
a resistance of 3 kw. in series, so if two keys are pressed simultaneously,
the relay will trip, providing an alternative path to keep P4 closed after the
keys are released, and passing a current through the indicating meter.
Contact B of the guess and selector keys, de-energises the relay P3.
The relay is energised by the selector key for direct trials, and by the guess
key for precognitive trials. For direct trials the selection remains on re-
lease of the key, but for precognition trials the instrument is made ready
for the next selection on release of the key.
P3 disconnects the oscillator from the scaling circuit, as already described,
thus making the selection, and applies the voltage to the lamps and counters.
On making a guess contact C operates before contact D ; contact C con-
nects the success counter to the appropriate circuit, but neither counter
can operate till contact D is made.
The operation of the trial counter prepares the instrument for another
selection when operated for direct trials.
Condensers C16 C17 C19 C20 are inserted in order to prevent switching
surges caused by the relays breaking the counter circuits. These pulses
may otherwise cause spurious operation of the scaling circuit, and cause
false results.
Sg and S7 switch from direct operation to precognitive operation.

Statistical Analysis of the Selection
Test for Sequence Preferences.
The first thousand numbers selected by the machine, were tested in the
usual way (Soal 1937). A number was arbitrarily assigned to each lamp,
and the sequence of lamps lit was taken down by hand. They were then
arranged in a ring, and the number of times that the lamp r follows the

array as follows :

Total 256 235 260 249 1000
The mean expectation for each of these numbers is
62J. On analysis it
is found that = 5- There are four linear relations between these sixteen
numbers «„, so there are 16-4 = 12 degrees of freedom. The probability
of exceeding this chance deviation is 0*95.
Test for Frequencies.
A more sensitive test for frequencies can be made by considering the
deviations of the totals for each lamp from the mean. These deviations
are : 6, - 15, 10, - i. The standard deviation is 14, so that none of these
deviations are significant.
Test for Repeats.
Let the number of occasions any one lamp is lit x times in succession be
Sj.. Then the observed values for S^; can be compared with the expected
values for a chance distribution. The comparison is shown below :
Observed Expected
S5 2 2
84' 5 9
S3 not 35
S2 computed 140.5
S2 + 2S3 + 3S4+4S5+ 258 250
This is a sufficiently close agreement.
Further Tests.
Further tests are made from time to time for frequencies alone, by count-
ing automatically the total number of selections made, and the number of
selections of one individual lamp. Also a system for testing sequence pre-
ferences using the automatic counters, has been devised ; this depends
upon the eifect discovered by G. W. Fisk (Tyrrell 1936). The tester
operates the guess buttons, continually pressing the same button till a
success is scored. He then changes to the next lamp till he scores a success
with that lamp ; and so on. With a deficiency of " repeats " this gives a
higher probability of success. With too many repeats a lower probability
is obtained, and with sequence preferences, the probabilitity is either
higher or lower, depending on the sequence.
When testing automatically, the machine is usually tested in runs of 100
to enable comparisons to be made between runs, and to make sure there
I
are no faults of short duration. Sometimes 10 1 trials were made by mis-
174] Random Selectors for E.S.P. Experiments 229
take. In order to avoid wasting these readings, the percentage of successes
was taken as the score.
The number of successes for each run of 100, for all methods of testing,
was tabulated. 157 runs were included. The frequency of occurrence
vof a score x was plotted against x. The expected value of ^ is given by
the formula
where ^^^C^ is the coefficient of p'' in the expansion of ( i +py°^.
The agreement is shown in Fig. 4.
There is a large preponderance of the value a; = 25. This is not signifi-
cant, since it is the only large deviation in the table, and it is only worth
I
mention in case some plausible non-chance hypothesis can be found to
explain it.

THE VOLUME OF BYRON : A SIGNIFICANT
BOOK-TEST
C. Drayton Thomas
In the winter of 1930, my aunt Margaret residing at Tenterden, wrote that
she wished to give me a volume of Byron's poems which had belonged to
my grandfather and contained marginal notes in his handwriting.
To the best of my belief this was the first time I had heard of this annotated
book ;
knowing how interested my father had been in his father's literary
work, I took occasion at the next sitting to mention the expected gift,
hoping that it might be made the subject of an experiment. My father re-
marked " I wonder if Grandfather will remember anything about his notes ",
At my sitting with Mrs Osborne Leonard on December 24th, 1930, my
uncle Alfred (aunt Margaret's husband) speaking through Feda (the Con-
trol) said:
" Do you say Aunt is giving you one book? I thought she was giving
you two. There was something in her mind that suggested you were to
have two books . . . See if she has put in it the page which used to be
kept in that book and could be slipped in and out."
After some remarks about the book, he added :
" Tennyson—has this book been placed near the Works of Tennyson?
or has Aunt been thinking a good deal about Tennyson lately? I get the
thoughts so mixed—Tennyson and Byron ;
you might try to unravel this."
A few days later I visited Tenterden and, having exchanged greetings
with my aunt, immediately asked to see her books. This I did lest she
should bring the Byron to me and thus prevent my ascertaining what books
had stood near it. I was not familiar with the house, into which my aunt
had recently removed, and did not know where her books were kept.
My aunt led me into a room which I do not remember to have previously
entered and pointed to a shelf on which stood some forty volumes. The
Byron was only one-quarter of an inch distant from a volume of Tennyson's
Complete Works, the two books being separated only by a thin manuscript.
I confess to a feeling of surprise on seeing this, but that surprise was
increased by my aunt's next words. She said, " During Christmas I
wished to find Tennyson's lines, '
Ring out wild bells ', and could not find
them." I found the page for her and, while she was reading it, thought
over this double fulfilment of the test. Alfred had spoken of two thoughts
or ideas mingled—Tennyson and Byron. Those names had, as I now heard,
been in my aunt's thought recently ; and not only so, but the Works of
those poets were standing side by side on her shelf. This would account
for the uncertainty as to whether the linking together of the two poets was
due to the position of their books or to thoughts in Margaret's mind.
My aunt now took the Byron from the shelf and placed it in my hands,
and next she found a volume of Whittier asking if I would accept that also.
It was then that I recalled Alfred's remark that he thought Aunt proposed
giving me two books, as he had found something in her mind to that effect.
230
[Part 174] The Volume of Byron : A Significant Book-Test 231
Thus he had rightly interpreted two different thoughts, one relating to
Tennyson and the other to the gift of a second book.
This indicates cognisance of facts both physical and mental. My com-
municator had not only found the position of books on a shelf, but had
been aware of thoughts and intentions in Margaret's mind.
Further descriptive statements about the Byron book had been made at
the sitting :
" Inside are two coloured sheets, as if the paper were of two qualities.
On opening the book you distinctly see this deeper shade."
This I found correct : the first and last pages are brown, and made of
paper different in quality from the rest of the book.
" Alfred has an idea that this book has illustrations. He remembers
something of them."
The Byron had been in Alfred's keeping after my grandfather's death.
This statement about illustrations proved to be correct ; there were two
pictures in the book as published, and a third, showing Byron as a youth,
had been pasted inside the cover.
I now come to what proved to be the most interesting remark of all.
'
" Has she put the page in? Do you mind looking to see? There used
to be something kept in the book that could be slipped in and out. He
has forgotten what it was, but wonders if it is still there."
While standing by the bookshelf and turning the pages of the Byron, I
noticed something which might have been intended by this remark. It
looked like a sheet of paper gummed in position between two pages. I
hastily closed the book without examining this leaf ; because it occurred
to me that I could ask for further information about it at a subsequent
sitting.
Taking the Byron home I put it away and did not look at it again until
further information had been given about this special page.
At my next sitting Grandfather was said to be present and giving the
following. I state the items singly, adding to each the verification dis-
covered when examining the book at home.
I began by asking if Grandfather would speak about his Byron.
Feda : There was a loose page and he thinks it was not quite the same
size as the other pages. There was quite a dissimilarity, different texture
and class of paper too. It did not seem to belong and yet it was there . . .
If you felt its surface you would know at once that it was not really part of
the book.
A perfectly correct statement. This added page is smaller than the
others, different in shade and texture, and feeling irregular to the touch
where two pieces of paper had been gummed over the original surface.
Feda : Grandfather's impression was that this page had been creased or
folded. He thinks you will find it so.
This, too, is correct. There is a deep crease running from top to bottom,
owing to the page having been cut from a double sheet of previously used
sermon paper and still showing the original centre fold.
232 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
Feda : This is important : there are hnes going the opposite way to
those in the book. Something on the paper makes you feel it ought to be
the other way about.
This is so ; the writing of the notes is horizontal, whereas the original
sermon writing runs perpendicularly.
I then asked if Grandfather knew what was on the paper and why it had
been inserted. The answer was :
Feda : Yes, he knows. There should be something on it which is not
strictly connected with the book. Something is, but something is not.
He thinks there is something on that paper which will indicate to you
something different from Byron.
I found both sides of the inserted page covered with historical notes
about Napoleon, while such words of the original sermon as are visible
refer to Babylon and the Pope.
We now come to the final and most important remark :
Feda : I wonder whether he had numbered the page ; for there is some- 'i
thing in his mind about a number. He thinks when you look at it you will
say, " I wonder why this was put in here."
This conveyed nothing to me. It must be remembered that I had
not examined this inserted page. The momentary glimpse when the book
was first placed in my hands had shown merely a sheet of paper with
writing on it. I had instantly closed the book so that I might obtain no
information. This left the way clear for further inquiry ; it seemed
possible that if Grandfather had thought it sufficiently important to add a
page, he might recollect his reason for doing so. When, after this final
sitting, I came to scrutinise the page I was considerably puzzled. As
already remarked, the leaf had been cut from a double page of writing paper, .
one side of which was originally covered in my grandfather's handwriting
by sermon material. I can read, for instance, the words " Babylonian
punishment . . . Pope Adrian VI and the Catholic Princes . . . Downfall of
ancient Babylon." The side of the sheet on which this sermon was written
is almost completely covered by two pieces of paper which have been
gummed over it. These, together with the reverse, are filled with historical
notes about Napoleon, his battles and the condition of France at that
period.
Having satisfied myself about the contents of this inserted leaf I pro-
ceeded to read the pages of Byron between which it was affixed. And it*
was indeed a puzzle why it had been inserted there. The leaf stands be- -
tween pages 558 and 559, and the headings of those pages are, Windsor ;
Poetic Stanzas for Music ; Address intended to be recited on the Cale-
donian Meeting ; Fragments of an Epistle to Mr. Thomas Moore ; Con-
solatory Address to Sarah, the Countess of Jersey.
Why then had this leaf been placed amid such irrelevant material? I
could not say. Following a hint given in the sitting I examined the in-
serted page for a number. At first I failed to find one, but later noticed,
very faintly^ pencilled in the top left corner, the figures 560. That gave the
^ It was necessary to darken these figures in order to render them visible in the
photograph.

174] The Volume of Byron : A Significant Book-Test 233
needed clue. This page numbered 560 had been inserted by mistake be-
tween 558 and 559. I therefore turned to see in what company it would
have been if placed overleaf, and I found that it would then have been in its
right place, facing the poem, Napoleon's Escape from Elba, and another
entitled Ode to the French.
Let us sum up the information so correctly given :
1. The Byron and Tennyson were standing close together.
2. A second book was to be given me.
3. My aunt had been recently thinking of Tennyson.
4. The Byron volume had two pages of a colour different from the rest,
also illustrations, and an inserted special page.
5. One page was of a size different from those of the book and of
another texture. (This I had probably noticed on first finding it and it may
therefore be disregarded as evidence).
6. It had been creased or folded.
7. Some of its writing ran in a direction other than that of the book
—
8. and alluded to a subject not strictly connected with Byron.
9. Examination would raise the question why it had been placed in its
present position.
10. There was, or should be, a number written on this page.
One cannot think that such information, some of it relating to notes
written sixty years previously, could have been discovered by the medium's
psychic faculty, and most certainly it was not discovered by me. I had
known nothing of these facts, and it is highly improbable that the majority
of them would ever have been noticed but for my following up the reference
to a special page and the hint that it was inserted in the wrong place. The
only explanation that seems acceptable is the one given in the sitting ;
namely, that this evidence was devised and carried through by the memory
and observation of my grandfather, assisted by my father and by Alfred,
in whose possession the book had been.
Surveying the above material we find Memory, Telepathy and Sight.
Memory. It is an instance of memory by one who left earth some 60
years previously. This is not uncommon in first-class sittings. It in-
dicates that memory is independent of the material brain, although so
closely associated with it in our mundane experience. The claim of com-
municators that their present non-material body includes a non-material
brain, suggests that even now man's etherial counterpart, which is said to
interpenetrate his physical body, is essential to the exercise of intelligence
and memory.
Telepathy. The ascertaining by the communicator of thoughts and in-
tention in my aunt's mind may be classed with mind-reading or telepathy
as known to us in spontaneous or experimental cases ;
though how it takes
place is unknown.
Clairvoyant sight. The ascertaining of the position of the Byron book
by the side of Tennyson's Works would appear to be an example of clair-
voyance. And the weight of evidence points to that clairvoyance having
been exercised by the communicator rather than by the medium or her
control. Grant that the communicator visited Tenterden to make his ob-
servations, one asks. How did he see the titles and position of the two books
standing together on that book-shelf? This question about sight and per-
234 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
ception always faces us in book-test experiments ; for that something tanta-
mount to sight has been employed is evident from the accurate description
so frequently given.
Remarks by communicators on this subject may be thus summed up :
Sometimes they can see physical objects clearly, but at other times not
;
my father says he has occasionally revisited a room to verify or extend his
previous observations and found that he could now see practically nothing.
Their vision for material objects depends on the presence of a psychic
emanation, similar to, or possibly identical with, that which Feda (Mrs
Leonard's control) terms " the power ". This emanation would seem to be
a go-between substance which is sufficiently akin to the Other World sub-
stance to be employable by our visitants, despite its earthly origin. It
facilitates, or makes possible, the processes of communication, and its
gradual exhaustion towards the end of a sitting progressively hinders re-
sults. A control is able to see all objects and persons within the area im-
pregnated by this emanation. It would therefore seem that, while not itself
luminous, the emanation makes visible to discarnates anything within its
area. Hence the reason why mediums are often alluded to as " the light ".
Since much evidence exists for communicators having perceived events
and material objects in one's home, it seems that this emanation, in small
quantities, is given off by ordinary people. Hence, in the case under con-
sideration, we may suppose that my aunt's constant presence in her sitting-
room had provided sufficient traces of the emanation to enable Alfred to
perceive the juxtaposition of the books.
Communicators say that their etherial senses are adjusted to the realms
which they now inhabit but not to our material world ; hence it may well
be, as they assert, that some are better able than others to surmount the
difficulties of observing physical objects and that, as with ourselves, some
can exercise clairvoyance for material things while others entirely fail to do
so despite persistent endeavours.
Considerable experience of proxy cases, in which unknown communica-
tors came to my sittings to give evidential material for their friends on
earth, has shown that some do well, others indifferently, while others com-
pletely fail. (See my article on Proxy Cases, S.P.R. Proceedings for May,
1933. P- 140-). .
The probability is that my grandfather, after completing this particular
page of notes, left it in the Byron at the appropriate place ; that he sub-
sequently deemed it better to fasten it there and inadvertently fixed it on
the wrong side of the right page. This mistake he may have noticed after-
wards and seen no need to rectify, since the notes were for his use alone.
But how can this be harmonised with Alfred's reference to something
which " used to be kept in the book and could be slipped in and out
something which he queried if I should find still there? The explanation
came later, when, some months after these sittings, my cousin, the son of
Alfred and Margaret, visited us. While telling him of this book test I
placed the Byron in his hands, indicating the special page above described.
After looking at it he turned over the leaves and finally found the " loose
page " of which his father had spoken, one that could be " slipped in and
out." Tfiis was a double sheet of exceedingly thin, blue writing paper, and
was entirely covered by our grandfather's handwriting—some twenty
174] The Volume of Byron : A Significant Book-Test 235
quotations from poets ancient and modern embodying ideas and phrases
which Byron had used in his works.
This was something entirely different from my grandfather's description
and evidently not the page which he had so minutely recollected. It
would seem therefore that, while Alfred had remembered the loose page
of blue paper, my grandfather had recollected another, one which he had
carelessly gummed between the wrong pages, or rather on the wrong side
of the right page of his Byron!
In this test we find three communicators successively taking their several
parts. First my father, who questions whether his father will be able to
remember anything about his notes. Secondly, my uncle, who recalls
several facts about the volume which he had treasured after his father's
death, and who referred to a " loose page " which could be slipped in and
out. Thirdly, with my father came my grandfather, who, ignoring the
loose blue page, spoke of another which he had better cause to remember,
since he had fastened it in its wrong position. In giving his description of
this he relied entirely on memory, having refused the opportunity of in-
specting the volume in my study. That his recollection should have been
so accurate after the lapse of some sixty years is remarkable.
Records from Sittings relating to the Byron Book
December ^th, 1930. My father controlling.
C. D. T. : I often wonder what Grandfather is doing now.
J. D. T. : He is leading a very satisfactory life and active in matters con-
nected with earth.
C. D. T. : Especially with the Churches?
J. D. T. : Yes, and also in spiritualism, especially the growth of spiritual
character. If that comes through psychical research, then Grandfather
will be interested in that ; but he helps everything which he thinks will
open the mind to the spiritual. He is interested in the welfare and pro-
gressive work of the Church, and in so far as he thinks psychic research
will help the ministry generally, he works for it.
C. D. T. : Aunt Margaret writes that she has found Grandfather's old
edition of Byron in which he had written marginal notes ; and she offers to
give it to me.
J. D. T. : I think, Charlie, that will be very interesting. I wonder if he
will remember anything at all about his notes.
C. D. T. : They would probably seem very unimportant to him now,
something like our school spelling book would be to us.
J. D. T. : It is all very difficult ;
things that seemed so very important
when we were children we simply don't take the trouble to remember in
adult life ; and so with much that seemed important on earth. If we are
coming back for purposes of identification we try to remember them, but it
must be difficult for some people to do so.
C. D. T. : And yet I understood that your memory on that side is per-
fect!
J. D. T. : We could do it, but we don't waste time ; we remember those
things which are vital to us now. The mere fact that we can remember
certain things does not make us remember them. We should only recall
those unnecessary things for purposes of identification.
236 ,
. C. Drayton Thomas [Part
C. D. T. : So recollection with you, as with us, is an act of will?
J. D. T. : Certainly, else the whole thing would have to be written on
one page and one would have to see every word of it at one glance. The
different things and remembrances of life are on different pages, and we
can turn them more easily than you can. So many of your pages are stuck
together.
December z^th, 1930. The communicator is my Uncle Alfred, Aunt
Margaret's husband.
Feda : Uncle Alfred is here.
C. D. T. : I am hoping to visit Aunt shortly. She has promised to give
me Grandfather's volume of Byron.
Feda: Do you say she is going to give you one book.? I thought she was
giving you two.
C. D. T. : She only mentioned one.
Feda : Of course, if she only gives you one you can't say, " You were
going to give me two," but perhaps you can somehow ascertain. There
was something in her mind that suggested that you were to have two books.
And, Oh! has she put the page in? Do you mind looking to see if she has
put it in? There used to be something kept in the book that could be
slipped in and out. He has forgotten just what it was, but he wonders if it
is still there. Inside the book are two coloured sheets, as if the paper was
either of two qualities or faded and tinted a little ; on opening the book you
distinctly see this deeper shade.
C. D. T. : It will be interesting to look for that, because I have never yet
seen the book.
Feda : Uncle Alfred has an idea that this book has illustrations ; he re-
members something of them. Byrons are not usually illustrated. So
notice that. He would like you to.
Wait a minute. Tennyson, has it been put near works of Tennyson, or
has Aunt been thinking a good deal of Tennyson lately, or has Aunt got
them mixed up ? They are very dissimilar, but I got the thoughts so mingled
—Tennyson and Byron. You might try and unravel this, would you?
C. D. T. : Yes, I will remember that when I go to see Aunt Margaret.
Feda : Your father says that Uncle Alfred is not so much in touch with
Aunt as he, your father, is with your mother and with you. But Alfred has
been with Aunt recently in the hope that you would be seeing her. And
Alfred was very good about some things.
January 2,0th, My grandfather communicating.
Feda: Your grandfather has come.
C. D. T. : Is he going to speak about his Byron?
Feda : There was a loose page and he thinks it was not quite the same
size as the other pages. There was quite a dissimilarity, and was it not of a
different texture, a different class of paper too? It did not seem to belong,
and yet it was there. It was just placed in, but did not really belong to it.'
If you felt its surface you would know at once that it was not really part of
the book.
Had it got creased or folded? Grandfather's impression was that it had
been creased or folded, and he thinks you will find it so.
174] The Volume of Byron : A Significant Book-Test 237
Now this is important ; he says " Hnes going the opposite way to 'the
book, something on the paper makes you feel it ought to be the other way
about." He can't get it any better than that.
Would you see if something is sUghtly uneven near to the edge of the
loose page, not quite perfect and square cut.
Your father is glad that Grandfather has said those things about it, else
it might have seemed as if an ordinary page had broken loose, which was
not the case. Grandfather did not wish to leave that impression; and he
thinks of nothing else at the moment.
C. D. T. : Does he know what was on that paper and why it was placed
in the book?
Feda : Yes, he knows. There should be something on it which is not
strictly connected with the book. Something is, but something is not.
He thinks there is something on that paper which will indicate to you
something different from Byron.
I wondered whether he had numbered the page ; for there is something
in his mind about a number. He thinks that when you look at it you will
say, " I wonder why this was put in here." It is long ago and he can't at
this moment quite recollect it himself. That is all he recalls.
C. D. T. : Are these recollections from olden days, or have you looked
up these items?
Feda ;
No, this is recollection. He would be afraid to try picking this
up in your study. Your father suggested that, but Grandfather preferred
not to try ; he said he would only go back in his memory.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE
SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH
PART 175
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS
1948
By W. H. Salter
My sense of the great honour which the Council have done me in placing
my name on the distinguished roll of Presidents of this Society, would be
overwhelming, if I did not regard it, as I am sure I may, as a tribute to
the work done for the Society by all who from its foundation have held the
office of Hon. Secretary, and particularly by such of my predecessors in
that office as through early death or other accident of circumstance never
sat in the Presidential Chair. I would ask you then to bear in honoured
and grateful memory today the names of Edmund Gurney, one of our
Founders and the principal author of the first classic of our subject.
Phantasms of the Living ; Frank Podmore, whose chief book is still, after
more than forty years, the best account of the early history of psychical
research ; and Everard Feilding, in his own line the best investigator that
the Society has known.
It would be fitting, when remembering them, to recall to mind also
Richard Hodgson, for many years Secretary of the American Branch, as
it then was, and Alice Johnson, whose long service to psychical research
included work as Secretary, Editor and Research Officer. How much
rather would I now be listening to a Presidential Address from any of
them, than launching out on one of my own!
Widely as they differed in opinion, on one matter they would have been
united, namely in affirming that their individual efforts in psychical
research—distinguished as these were—gained immensely in effectiveness
from being part of an organised, corporate activity. They would one and
all have repudiated any suggestion that the time and experience they so
freely gave to the administrative side of the Society's work, humdrum as
much of that is, were in any sense wasted.
It is a great advantage for any study, whatever the subject, to have the
support of an established Society with good prospects of future continu-
ance, a Society which can provide funds for research and publication,
maintain a library and give those engaged in the study opportunities to
meet and discuss their work. For a study not closely connected with any
academic curriculum or professional interest the backing of such a Society
is almost indispensable.
Psychical research is in that detached position now, and likely to remain
Q 239
240 W. H. Salter [Part
there for some time to come, nor in my opinion should we regret it. On
the contrary, no worse fate could, I believe, befall psychical research than
for it to become a sub-division of some more orthodox branch of learning,
or for it to lose its independence too soon, before it has more completely
exploited its own domain, and before there is a better understanding of
its problems and methods in those provinces of science on which it abuts.
It was only because psychical research from the start claimed to be an
autonomous study that men and women trained in many different
branches of learning—philosophy and scholarship, as well as science in its
more restricted meaning—and with varied experience of life, were able
to unite for its advancement on an equal footing, and to contribute that
wealth of knowledge and thought drawn from many sources, from which
our enquiries have profited.
The psychical researcher cannot be an expert in all the branches of
specialised knowledge that from time to time his enquiries may demand.
One and the same man cannot reasonably be expected to be a fully qualified
physicist, psychologist, statistician, conjurer, doctor and photographer on
successive days of the week. If he knows what expert to consult on each
occasion, and how to employ the technical knowledge that expert can give
him, he has the proper equipment, so far as concerns the auxiliary technique
of his subject. But in one thing he must be himself a specialist all the
time, and that is psychical research, and only by the practice of psychical
research can he become a specialist in it. If in addition he has specialised
knowledge of any of the other subjects above mentioned, so much the
better. One of the advantages of a Society such as ours, which draws its
members from so many walks of life, is that the investigator can find within
our own ranks someone skilled in almost every auxiliary technique he is
likely to need.
It is for psychical research, not only in this country, but wherever it is
pursued as an impartial enquiry, that autonomy is claimed. We may,
however, fairly congratulate ourselves that our Society has contributed a
very large share to those achievements by which that claim can be justified.
That it has the longest unbroken history of all Societies engaged in the
same enquiry is partly due to world events, which have been less unkind
to our country than to many others, but partly, I like to think, to that
" uncompromising matter-of-factness " of the English mind, whose func-
tion our first President, Henry Sidgwick, suggested would be " to put the
final question to the Universe with a solid passionate determination to be
answered that must come to something ".
We should, however, temper our insular pride by the reflection that
our membership has included men and women of distinction from many
lands, and that for about sixteen years (1889- 1905) the American Society
and our own were united, facts which should be borne in mind in consider-
ing our Society's record.
I ask you to note how much of the Society's achievement is due to
corporate effort and organisation. First to be mentioned are the spon-
taneous cases, apparitions and the like. The systematic collection and
analysis of these was a new venture, initiated at Cambridge and taken up
soon after at Oxford, by groups of friends of whom some took the lead in
founding the Society, and others joined it shortly after its foundation.
175] Presidential Address 241
The first fruits of their labours are to be sought in Phantasms. A fev\^
years later the Census of Hallucinations was undertaken on the recom-
mendation of an International Committee, and cases were collected fti
several countries. The organisation, however, was entrusted to the S.P.R.,
which followed up enquiries, tabulated the cases and was responsible for
the Report. But it was not merely the machinery for conducting the
Census that the Society provided. Much of the value of these cases
—
and the same is true of the large number collected in the half-century
that has passed since the Report was published—is due to the fact that a
highly competent Committee set up standards of evidence which were
impersonal, and not framed to meet the subjective peculiarities of any
individual mind.
Next in time comes the investigation of Mrs Piper, beginning of course
in America, but continued by the joint labours of British and ^\merican
investigators, who worked together so closely and so harmoniously, that
it would be absurd to partition the credit between them. We may, how-
ever, claim for the Society the glory of having produced, in Mrs Sidgwick's
study of Mrs Piper, the most complete psychological analysis of any
medium so far published {Proc, XXVIII).
Mrs Leonard's mediumship followed close on that of Mrs Piper.
While it is not the subject of any single paper in Proceedings comparable to
Mrs Sidgwick's study above mentioned, it is second only to that of Mrs
Piper for the thoroughness with which it has been investigated by our
members from many angles. At various stages, as for instance, in the
study of the book-tests, the investigation was one in which the Society's
officials were in close collaboration with groups of members. I do not
believe that anything like the same advance in knowledge of this type of
mediumship could have been achieved by students not welded together
in one Society.
I do not propose to discuss here the bearing of the cross-correspondences
on the problem of survival : but quite apart from that, their psychical
and psychological interest is obvious. The group of automatists that
produced them had its origin in the S.P.R., although it spread beyond
our borders. The work of interpretation—and a colossal piece of work
too—was done entirely within the Society, by a collective effort surpassing
the powers of any single investigator.
To complete the account of the mental phenomena the experiments in
telepathy and allied faculties remain to be mentioned. This work has
been shared by workers in many lands, the American share being in
recent years particularly notable. We cannot claim that the share of the
Society in this department of research has been quite as large as in some
others, but we certainly have no reason to be ashamed of it.
In every branch therefore, of that great attempt to extend the knowledge
of the human mind to which psychical research is committed, our Society
has done a large, in some branches an overwhelmingly large share of the
work, the ability to do the work and the value of the work done being
both enhanced by the support the investigators have received from the
Society's organisation, and by the willing co-operation of their fellow
members. No result could have been more gratifying to the long line of
brilliant investigators, extending from the first Presidency of Henry
242 W. H. Salter [Part
Sidgwick in 1882 to Mrs Sidgwick's Presidency of Honour in the year of
our Jubilee, and including those whom I mentioned at the beginning of
my Address, who willingly spared time from their own researches to make
and keep the Society's machinery as efficient as possible.
On various occasions, when conferring with psychical researchers from
foreign parts, I have heard the comment that, as practised in England,
psychical research seemed to be a dreadfully dull business, and I have
been commiserated with for having so few opportunities to enjoy those
dramatic episodes which enliven night by night the seances of our confreres
in other lands. I have, however, at no time regiietted that our Society has
chosen the path of " matter-of-factness " backed by " passionate deter-
mination ", or seen cause to think that the record of our achievements
would be the brighter if it were adorned with the names of all the physical
mediums who have been boosted one day, exposed the next, and forgotten
the day after, but lacked all mention of Phantasms of the Living, the Census
of Hallucinations, Mrs Piper, Mrs Leonard, " the S.P.R. group of
automatists ", and that long series of experiments into paranormal cogni-
tion begun in the early days of the Society and still being pursued among
us with undiminished vigour.
The Society has certainly not neglected the physical phenomena and
has made considerable contributions to their exploration. In any history
of psychical research prominence should be given to two pieces of work
done by leading members of the Society in its early years, Hodgson and
Davey's study of the relation between mediumistic deception and mal-
observation on the sitter's part {Proc, IV and VIII), a text-book for
sitters which is not yet out of date, and Podmore's review of poltergeist
cases in Proc, XII. The latter did more than give a rational account of a
type of occurrence that had long puzzled mankind : it showed a great
advance in the understanding of psychological factors that are found at
work in many branches of psychical research.
When this Society was founded, much destructive work was needed
everywhere to clear away the accumulated lumber of uncritical ages, and
not till that was done could constructive work in any department begin.
As regards the mental phenomena, the Society soon found plenty of
material yielding positive results, from among its own members and the
public at large, in cases of spontaneous telepathy. It was also so fortunate
as to make contact with a remarkable mental medium, Mrs Piper, very
soon after her mediumship began. On this side of its work the construc-
tive stage was accordingly soon reached.
For the physical phenomena both the conditions and the results were
very different. They are not widespread, as " phantasms " are, and no
one has even suggested taking a Census of Materialisations. Nor have we
ever succeeded in repeating with any physical medium the experience we
enjoyed with Mrs Piper—that of being practically the first in the field.
It has been through all our history a discouraging chronicle of finding
that mediums who had achieved fame in the production of phenomena for
other investigators, failed hopelessly when sitting with researchers who
could be guaranteed to combine with tact the maintenance of proper
conditions of control. In a few instances some very meagre positive
results have been obtained, but it is unlikely that the constructive stage
ly^] Presidential Address 243
will be reached as long as control conditions elsewhere are so much laxer
than those on which we insist.
But if the course of our enquiry be viewed as a whole, we have no
reason to be dissatisfied with the progress made. We may not yet be in a
position " to put the final question to the Universe " with a right to demand
an answer, but it is becoming clearer in what terms that question will have
to be put, and that in itself is a result not unworthy of the very eminent
men and women—philosophers, scientists and others—who have been
active members of our Society. It would take the whole afternoon to
recite the list of them, with a summary of the work, in psychical research
and in the world at large, for which each name is memorable. But, while
it is not on the eminence of individual members, however noteworthy,
but on its success in extending our knowledge of human personality that
the Society will be judged, we may at least remind our critics of the
improbability that so many men and women, so highly distinguished in
so many different ways, should have been mistaken either as to the import-
ance of our enquiries or as to the validity of the methods by which they
have been pursued.
There has been a good deal of discussion lately as to our methods and
standards of evidence, and the suggestion has been made that we should
modify our procedure in order to attract the interest of persons whose
training has been in more orthodox departments of learning. The object
is praiseworthy, but the means proposed require scrutiny. Every form of
organised enquiry is conducted in accordance with its own procedure and
its own methods of ascertaining facts : law, physics, history, psychiatry,
are a few examples that can be named. Each has worked out the method
which it finds most satisfactory in solving its particular problems, having
regard both to the subject matter of the enquiry, and to the course of
events to which the enquiry is intended to lead. Clashes between them
are not unknown ;
lawyers and doctors are in perpetual disagreement
about insanity as a defence in criminal proceedings. It is impossible to
switch over a system designed for one form of enquiry to another without
creating confusion. But every specialised system, however complete the
satisfaction it may give to those who use it, must justify itself as a legitimate
offspring of common-sense, and must show that any divergences it may
make from other systems are neither capricious nor arbitrary. Particu-
larly incumbent is it on a relatively small body of enquirers, as we
admittedly are, not to adopt methods peculiar to ourselves, and unused by
larger and more highly organised groups, unless we can show good reason
for doing so.
We are sometimes invited to make our researches conform to the
procedure of science, to use that word in its popular, restricted meaning.
I have heard and read many discussions on this subject which seemed to
me wide of the point. Insufficient consideration seems to me to be given
to the variety of ways in which psychical research and science are related,
and I hope you will pardon me for taking up a little of your time in
dwelling on them.
Several auxiliary techniques which the psychical researcher may from
time to time need to use have been mentioned. Some of these are part
of the domain of natural science, physics for example. Others, such as
244 W. H. Salter [Part
medical psychology, claim a place within the scientific fold, but seem to
have met with a mixed reception from those already in possession. Then
there are highly organised bodies of knowledge, which can properly on
that ground claim to be sciences, though not part of science in the
narrower sense, as they may, like statistics, be applicable to many forms of
activity not usually accounted scientific, such as business or public affairs.
However useful any of these may be to the psychical researcher, none of
them are an integral part of psychical research, and their applicability or
otherwise to any type of psychical enquiry has no bearing on the question
whether that type of enquiry is valid or not. If, however, the enquiry is
such that one of these techniques, when applied to it, will produce
information that could not be obtained otherwise, then the psychical
researcher should use it, and if he uses it, he must use it as it would be
used by an expert.
Next to be considered is the case where the same subject matter, and
possibly the same facts, are under the examination of two groups of
enquirers, each studying them from a dift'erent angle. An example
familiar to members of this Society will be the study of hypnotism and
dissociations of personality by psychical researchers and medical psycholo-
gists. If you take the men who were most prominent in the early years of
the Society, here, on the Continent and in America, men such as
Frederic and Arthur Myers, Gurney, Richet, William James, you have a
group each and every member of which had some knowledge, considerable
knowledge in fact, of medicine, and psychology, and psychical research,
in whichever of those subjects he might have specialised. Is there any
better way to ensure rapid progress in investigation than for the same
material to be examined from several angles by groups each of which is at
pains to keep acquainted with the aims, methods and results of the other
groups
Enquirers, however, seldom confine their opinions to the facts ascer-
'
tained by their enquiry. There is usually some admixture, large or small,
of inference, and this is where trouble often develops. Two bodies of
enquirers each have a mass of ascertained fact, from which they launch
inferences as to facts that they have not been able to bring under direct
examination, and the inferences may be in conflict. The old dispute
between physicist and biologist as to the span of time to be allowed for
the development of life on the earth's surface, is an example. Each of the
disputants had plenty of facts to back him, but not facts which extended
to personal observation of the time, place and conditions under which life
arose. So they had to make inferences, and for a time the inferences did
not agree.
That was an instance of conflict between two highly organised scientific
groups. But to leave this example and speak generally, in a dispute
where each side relies partly on fact and partly on inference, two questions
are material, which party has on its side the largest body of fact, and which |
party has on its side the body of fact, whether large or small, most directly
bearing on the dispute and requiring the least amount of inference to
make it relevant. The most diflicult disputes are those where quantity
is on one side and relevance on the other.
For psychical researchers this problem has arisen in different forms with
175] Presidential Address 245
regard to both physical and mental phenomena. The reality of physical
phenomena has been accepted after investigation by a few scientists of
the highest eminence, such as Crookes and Lodge, but not accepted by the
world of science at large. Why this difference? First, as to fact, scientists,
including Crookes and Lodge, had a very large body of fact which they
all of them accepted : there was a much smaller body of fact, or alleged
fact, which Crookes and Lodge accepted after examination, but which
scientists in general, with splendid exceptions such as the late Lord
Rayleigh and his father, did not even bother to examine. Now as to
inference, Crookes and Lodge had no need to draw any ; if their facts
were right, they took them the whole way. Those scientists who refused
to examine the evidence on which Crookes and Lodge relied seem to have
drawn the inference from facts common to Crookes and Lodge and them-
selves, that there were general principles or " laws " governing the
physical universe of such wide applicability as to make any exception to or
transcendence of them impossible. But so many supposed " impossi-
bilities " are continually being proved true, that this inference was not a
very safe ground for refusing even to examine what men of the status of
Crookes and Lodge accepted. The alleged phenomena were within the
scientists' own province : they had resources of personnel, of equipment,
of finance far superior to any at the command of the small band of psychical
researchers to whom they relinquished the task. If these resources had
been brought to bear with an open mind, the problem of physical
phenomena might by now have been settled.
Telepathy does not seem to be much more popular with science than,
say, telekinesis, though here again, the supporters include a number of
scientists of the highest rank. But the evidential status of the two subjects
is widely different. Telekinesis, if it occurs, is a physical event, and is
presumably governed by some physical laws ; if not by laws already
accepted, then by others not perhaps yet discovered. Telepathy, on the
other hand, is not on the face of it a physical event at all. It exists when
two minds have a common content, in such conditions and to such an
extent that normal communication, e.g. by speech or writing, cannot be
supposed to have produced it. Whether or not a situation of this kind has
occurred is not a matter for natural science at all. It is much more like
the problems with which the lawyer and the historian are concerned, but
the procedure which in this matter holds the field is that of psychical
research and no other. It was designed to deal with it, and has successfully
dealt with it for more than sixty years. In defining this situation I have
not mentioned the question whether the community of content between
the two minds is attributable to chance. That is a separate issue,
determinable in some instances by statistical method : but statistics,
while much used in science, are also, as already mentioned, used in other
cormections.
If anyone chooses to explain telepathy by some physical law, such as
radiation, the physicist and the physiologist are within their respective
provinces in criticising that explanation. But they have no special claim
as physicists or physiologists to sit in judgment on telepathy, or on any
explanation of it that does not invoke physical processes. If the subject
interests them, let them join our ranks, as several of their most eminent
246 W. H. Salter [Part
colleagues have done, and learn our well-tested methods. That the
results of our enquiries have won neither a knowledge nor an acceptance
commensurate with their importance is a fact we all deplore. To set it
right we must boldly appeal to Caesar, to that wide community of educated
opinion from which are derived all specialised systems of enquiry, our
own and those of the natural sciences alike.
We are all familiar with the sort of questions our friends ask when we
try to explain telepathy to them, or to interest them in it. The questions
vary from person to person, but, so far as my experience goes, they fall
under three main heads : (i) Can you prove it? (2) how does it work? (3)
what is the use of it? Now, each of these questions seems to me to call
for a different kind of evidence.
First, where proof is concerned, there is nothing to equal experiment,
preferably quantitative experiment. That was the position taken up by
the founders of the Society who experimented on those lines themselves,
and would have warmly welcomed the great extension of such experiment
in recent years, and the improved technique now available. They were,
however, far from neglecting or undervaluing the qualitative evidence
obtainable by other methods. In almost every branch of psychical
research sceptics are to be found within the Society, but I do not know
of a single member who is familiar, whether by investigation or by study of
the literature, with the evidence, qualitative and quantitative, for telepathy,
who does not regard this faculty as proved, however little else he may
accept. Outside the Society, disbelief, so far as my experience goes, is
usually grounded on a priori objections divorced from study of the
evidence on its own merits.
The second question, how does it work? is ambiguous. If it means,
what is the process? all that can be done is to mention certain processes
in order to indicate their improbability. Of these the most popular is
" waves ", and although this view does not lack weighty support, it seems
to me most improbable if applied to the complex images and messages
that are the content of spontaneous experiences, and have been the
material for qualitative experiments. This is a notable instance of the mis-
conceptions likely to arise if the more complex manifestations of this or
any other psychic faculty are ruled out because they do not readily
accommodate themselves to statistical analysis. There is not, as far as I
know, evidence of any physical process capable of producing all the
manifestations of telepathy with which we are familiar, and it seems to
me quite possible that none will ever be discovered.
If, however, it is meant, what conditions favour telepathy? experiment
of many kinds and spontaneous cases of the kind printed in Phantasms
and later volumes of our Journal and Proceedings both seem to throw a
good deal of light on it. I stress the spontaneous cases because in these
the faculty is seen at work in its natural surroundings, and the effect of
even the best experiments may sometimes be to produce an artefact, in
which some of the essential features of telepathy are incompletely repro-
duced. But both types of evidence have their value. The spontaneous
cases suggest that certain conditions of mind and body in the percipient,
certain relations between agent and percipient, favour positive results.
In experimental work, as Dr Soal has recently emphasised, classification
175] Presidential Address •
247
of percipients according to recognised psychological types has already in
America provided valuable information, and might advantageously be
more generally used.
The third question, what is the good of it? is the most difficult of all,
but it must be faced, as the most rigid demonstration of the existence of
a faculty will fail to carry full conviction, unless either its working is so
familiar to us all as to need no further proof, or it can be shewn to serve
some purpose, past, present or future. The type of evidence best adapted
for proof is that which appears to exclude chance by pronounced deviation
from the normal course of events, whether this evidence consists of out-
standing scores at card-guessing, or of crisis-apparition's. Both of these
are rare, relatively to the occurrences of everyday life, although there are
now on record several hundred instances of each.
These being the conditions under which proof of the existence of
telepathy must be established, can we reinforce the effectiveness of the
proof by some indication of purpose ? If there is one thing which on the
face of it seems more purposeless than the ability, attributed to a few
favoured persons, to acquire knowledge of the death of an uncle at the
Antipodes by seeing his apparition an hour or so before they would have
learnt of it by cable or wireless, it is the gift, apparently confined to even
fewer, of being able to guess correctly whether the card which an experi-
menter is holding up in an adjoining room bears the picture of a zebra
or a giraffe.
Were the only manifestations of telepathy of this kind, with no closer
connection with the experiences and purposes of ordinary life, many of
us might be inclined to suspect that, however perfect the proof might
look, there was a catch in it somewhere. But those of us who belong to
this Society know that more has to be taken into account than card-
guessing and crisis-apparitions. Colour is added to the bare outline of
the more strictly evidential matter by a large number of occurrences
examined by our observers, by unpublished experiments, and, for many,
by the spontaneous experiences of themselves and their friends. I see
nothing objectionable in anyone allowing his opinion of the nature and
purpose of telepathy to be influenced in this way, provided he can
distinguish, as all members of this Society must be supposed to do,
between impression and fact. Unless indeed we are sensitive to these
undertones, we are likely to let many opportunities for investigation pass
unnoticed.
The material with which the officers of this Society are called on to
deal is astonishing. Letters have to be answered from all sorts and
conditions of men and women all over the world, often relating the oddest
incidents and asking the oddest questions. Personal interviews are some-
times even more extraordinary. Nearly all the material is of the greatest
psychological interest, and much of it of psychical interest too. More of
it would have been of value to psychical research if the narratives could
have been verified earlier. In what follows I am referring to the residue
of experiences which seem to contain a genuine paranormal element, but
too small an element to bring the case " up to Journal standard ". The
facts are all right, but a reasonable person might doubt whether they
showed any departure from the normal course of events, as determined
248 W. H. Salter [Part
by chance-coincidence or the ordinary mental processes of the persons
concerned.
You have been so good as to allow me the opportunity, as one of your
officers, to see a good deal of this material at close quarters for several
years, and perhaps the best return I can make for your kindness is to say
what impression it has made on me, in what way it has added colour for
me to the evidence for paranormal cognition as set out in our Proceedings
and Journal, and what inferences I would draw from it, as pointers to
possible future investigation.
The cases printed in the Journal vary a good deal in the degree in which
they seem to require some explanation beyond chance or normal mental
process. They may be arranged in a graded series, extending downwards
into the cases which are reported to the S.P.R., but not printed. In some
of these latter—and this is a point of some interest—the persons reporting
them, ordinary sensible people, evidently see some significance which they
cannot " put across " to the Society's representative, who is bound to
temper personal sympathy with critical detachment. It is very probable
that the series does not end there, but might be continued to the point
where the percipient himself is uncertain whether his experience has any
paranormal element in it. He may have an indefinite feeling that it has,
but if he has, he is inclined to keep it to himself.
In spontaneous cases we have no exact means of measurement to test
whether paranormality does indeed " tail off " to the vanishing point, but
the refinements of statistical analysis show that in experiments this does
occur. The further question then arises, what justification have we for
stopping the series at any point short of that where the normal and the
paranormal merge, not only in appearance but in fact, or for assuming
that communications between any two persons may be either normal or
paranormal, but cannot conceivably be both at the same time?
When we see cases as they are set out in the Joimial, with a descriptive
label and serial number attached, we are inclined to think of each case,
assuming the evidence to satisfy us, as a separate outbreak of paranormal'
power, and to overlook indications that the faculty operates continuously
for considerable periods. Where successful experiments in E.S.P. with
the same agent and percipient are spread over months or even years, it is
hardly reasonable to suppose that the " rapport " (whatever that may be)
between agent and percipient, which has given positive results throughout
one evening, breaks off completely at its close, to re-establish itself on the
next occasion that an experiment is tried. Continuity emerges even more
clearly from the cross-correspondences. Let these be considered merely
as complicated examples of telepathy, regardless of whether it be telepathy
between the living or due on one side to discarnate agency. The automa-
tists are sometimes kept busy for years on end developing some particular
part of the pattern.
We have therefore a good deal of evidence suggesting that telepathy is,
in one form at least, a continuous process, for long periods indistinguish-
able from normal mental processes ; sometimes slightly but perceptibly
divergent from them : and only very occasionally developing into such
startling manifestations as crisis-apparitions.
But this view has its own difficulties. Why, it is sometimes asked, if
I75] Presidcniial Address 249
telepathy is so common, are we not receiving telepathic impressions all
the time? Life would be unlivable if we were, and either they are not
being transmitted or else some protective and selective mechanism has
been evolved, that prevents their penetrating our conscious minds. It is
here that it is useful to consider further the cases where the participants
in an experience see more in it than they can get a benevolent but detached
critic to see. We are all aware that members of groups,, of the same family,
for instance, or even persons more loosely connected by professional or
local ties, can understand each other with much less explicit statement
than would be needed if they were conversing with persons outside the
group. That is a quite normal, everyday alTair. We might say that for
ideas of one kind the tracks between A.'s conscious mind and B.'s have
worn smooth by frequent use, and for other ideas those between B.'s and
C.'s. As each conscious idea has many subconscious ideas connected
with it, this may mean that similar, but (to continue the simile) wider
tracks are worn smooth in the subconscious minds of A. and B., and of
B. and C, tracks wide enough to take a flow of paranormal as well as
normal traffic.
This may give rise to those curious cases, usually called " taking the
words out of one's mouth " with which many of us are familiar, in which
A. says something which his friend B. was on the point of saying, but
which neither A. nor B. regard as the natural outcome of what either had
previously said, a point on which A. and B., if persons of average intelli-
gence, must be taken as the best judges. Perhaps in these cases we have
a valuable opportunity, if we care to use it, of observing the normal and
paranormal at the point of divergence.
Conscious contacts between mind and mind through the normal means
of communication are by the circumstances of life discontinuous and of
short duration. When the normal contact is broken, the after effects of it
may be to keep the minds of both parties—their conscious and their
subconscious minds—moving on parallel lines for some time. But each
party has his own conscious experiences, unshared in the normal way by
the other, and these may deflect his mental processes so that, when normal
contact is resumed, it is not established as completely as on the previous
occasion. This, we know, frequently happens. If however, there may
be supposed to be subconscious contact of longer duration, effective both
during the periods of conscious contact, and also in between, the conscious
contacts would be strengthened and made more complete, and the deflec-
tions due to the intervening changes and chances of life would be minimised.
We need not suppose that for every conscious normal contact between
two minds, however slight or temporary, there is developed a correspond-
ing, but more durable, subconscious contact. That may be true, but it
seems to me more probable that subconscious contacts arise only from
conscious contacts that count for something with the minds concerned.
If, however, the subconscious mind be considered, so far as telepathy is
concerned, not as a vacuum into which casual impressions from all
quarters can crowd, but as at any given time occupied by, and in fact
mainly composed of, a network of established contacts, it would seem to
be well protected against stray intruders. The network would be a most
complex affair, as it would need to accommodate reciprocal transmission
25° W. H. Salter [Part
between A. and B., A. and C, and so on, and also to allow for the connec-
tions between A. and every other member of the group influencing the
connections between all other pairs within the group and being reciprocally
influenced by them ; not to mention connections between one group and
another, for few men and women limit their interests to a single group.
It has often been pointed out that to call telepathy " extra-sensory
perception " or " paranormal cognition " may be convenient for lack of a
better phrase, but conveys far too limited a conception. As Mr Tyrrell
has shown with regard to apparitions, and as is obvious from the cross-
correspondences (if these be regarded for the moment as instances of
telepathy without prejudice to other interpretations of them), there is
often a great deal of constructive work in which the subconscious minds of
agent and percipient participate.
The view of telepathy outlined above is, of course, speculative. It is
intended, that is to say, to place in perspective not only the more striking
evidence, spontaneous and experimental, on which alone ^roo/ of telepathy
can be based, but also those other rudimentary and marginal phenomena,
which inevitably come to the mind of anyone who has had experience of
psychical research in its many forms. If these occurrences depended on
the report of any single individual, or but a few individuals, they would
properly be discounted as subjective. But they are numerous and wide-
spread enough to rank as part, and in my opinion a fairly important part,
of the evidence bearing not so much on the question whether telepathy is
real, but on the secondary issue of its nature and purpose. The evidence
for this view is at any rate more substantial than for the conception of
telepathy which seems to be popularly prevalent, that it is a collection of
rare, disconnected, purposeless examples of the one-way transmission of
information through space by some process akin to wireless, a conception
of which every constituent item is almost certainly wrong.
At each stage I could, I believe, have quoted previous authority that
would carry weight in this Society, the final passage for example of the:
late Lord Balfour's Presidential Address {Proc, XIX, p. 396), but on the
main conclusion, you will remember that in Hmnan Personality (Vol. I,
p. 112) Myers described the passion " which binds hfe to life, which links
us both to life near and visible, and to life imagined but unseen " as " the
inward aspect of the telepathic law ". If I have from the material accrued
since his day cited some that in however slight a degree adds substance
to his prophetic vision, I am more than content.
With the conception of personality as something more than a simple
unit we are all, mainly through Myers's writings, familiar. The internal
structure of this composite entity, whether consisting of " strata " or of
independent " selves ", has been discussed fully by Lord Balfour,
McDougall, Mitchell and others. I wish I could refer you to equally
authoritative and illuminating discussions of the problem of the external
structure of personality, as affected by telepathy.
Much has indeed been written on the " Group Mind ", but the groups
which seem to have been most studied, the crowd, the primitive tribe,
the nation, are none of them groups within which telepathy, as distinct
from mass emotion, would be expected to be effective. Hence even a
writer as conversant with the case for telepathy as McDougall does no
175] Presidential Address 251
more than mention it briefly in this connection.^ It is not, however, with
any supposed collective consciousness that we are now concerned so much as
with the effect of telepathy within the group on the personality of each
member ; on what in Samuel Butler's phrase may be called his " vicarious
existence ". Butler, when he used this phrase, was thinking not of any tele-
pathic linkage, but of the influence which a man, a great writer, or painter or
musician, exercises over people unknown to him personally and even
perhaps unborn during his own bodily life. It is a conception of respectable
antiquity, of which Horace's non onuiis moriar is a famous expression.
But while a man's " vicarious existence " may affect more people for a
longer time than any influence he could exert in the flesh, it is only by a
figure of speech that it can be regarded as his existence. Political parties,
for example, seldom carry out their founders' intentions even while their
founders are still alive
—" Wilkes was never a Wilkesite ", as he protested
—
and the regularity with which within a generation they turn into something
fundamentally different is so notorious as to absolve me from the invidious
task of quoting examples. And indeed the limitations of " vicarious
existence " are implicit in the form in which Horace expresses the idea.
But the case is different if we turn to the more intimate groups of
family, friends and acquaintances which play so large a part in an ordinary
man's life, and consider the possible effect of the interplay within each
group of telepathy of the kind I have tried to describe. Where the group
consists of mere acquaintances, the effect might be nil, but where the
members are bound together emotionally, we cannot disregard the possi-
bility that the normal communications within the group are supplemented
and strengthened by telepathic linkage. This linkage may seldom be
apparent even to members of the group, and may be quite incapable of
proof to outsiders, but, as Dr Gardner Murphy has shown in recent
articles in the Journal of the American S.P.R., it cannot be disregarded in
assessing evidence for survival, since its effect may well be to create what
he calls " a static surviving entity " on which the power of unconscious
dramatisation frequently shown by mediums may confer a misleading
appearance of personal activity. Everyone must judge for himself how
far this conception accounts for such material, prima facie suggestive of
survival, as he is himself familiar with, whether through the' literature of
psychical research, or in the form of the unpublished experiences of
himself or his friends. As regards the material that has come to my notice
from many sources, it seems to me that much is covered by this conception,
but far from all. Until the " interpersonal field " has been explored, it
would be idle to attempt to distinguish with any assurance between
examples of paranormal action which could reasonably be supposed to
originate there and those for which some other origin must be sought, but
there have been incidents reported with Mrs Leonard, and I think with
Mrs Piper, too, that have had a particular appropriateness to the occasion
when they occurred, and are in that way not at all suggestive of ideas
drifting into the medium's subconscious mind from the "psychic field " and
receiving a dramatic form there. Nor does the element of design in the
cross-correspondences seem to me accounted for on this theory.
Two most important tasks for psychical research are, in my view, first
^ See his The Group Mind, pp. 28-30.
252 W.H.Salter [Part 175]
to define as clearly as is practicable the extent of the constructive ability
of the individual subconscious, for which purpose it will be necessary to
bring under survey much matter not entirely within our province, review-
'
ing, for example, in the light of later psychological knowledge, the
important chapter on Genius in Human Personality ; and secondly to
ascertain how far minds can collaborate on the entirely subconscious level
in devising a pattern or design, and in carrying it out.
It is not, however, clear to me that in examining any piece of evidence
that seems to point to some form of survival we are entitled to say, this is
either z manifestation of an active personality, or of an "interpersonal
psychic field ", and to exclude the possibility that it may be both, any more
than, in my view, we are justified in rejecting the possibility that an
incident may be at the same time telepathic, and also part of a normal
progression of mental events.
And just as in assessing evidence for a supposed case of telepathy, the
correct and objective method is to assess that evidence on its merits,
without importing complications arising from any hypothesis of the re-
lations between mind and body, so in assessing supposed evidence for
survival, the case should be judged on its merits without reference to
those or any other extraneous complications. When the assessment has
been made will come the stage of considering whether the result conflicts
with any external system of fact, which is possible, or with some system
of inference projected from fact, which is probable. No useful purpose is
served by attempting to coalesce the two stages.
I began this Address by laying emphasis on the part that the corporate
activities of this Society have played in promoting psychical research.
The effect of the collective effort has been to enhance, and not to obliterate,
the effort of each separate worker. In conclusion I sometimes wonder
whether we are sufficiently alive to the importance of the collective factor
in paranormal activity also. It is from Mr Whately Carington's group
experiments that some of the most interesting developments in extra-
sensory perception have arisen, and by general agreement it is through
" the S.P.R. group of automatists ", whose scripts claimed to be inspired
by a group of communicators, that some of the most striking evidence for
survival has-been obtained. And now that our researches have made
precognition respectable, I would hazard the prophecy that if the problems
of telepathy and survival were approached in a less individualistic spirit,
the supposed antithesis between them would be found to be illusory.
If you think I have been too speculative, I would claim the indulgence
of a first-offender, and plead the encouragement given by Professor Price
in his Presidential Address, when he said, " If people accuse us of being
speculative ... we must refuse to be frightened. We must postulate
unverifiable entities and processes if we cannot get on without them."
If you retort that I have claimed for myself a liberty of prophecying more
properly belonging to trained philosophers, I would most heartily agree,
knowing well that this Society has many members better equipped for
theoretic discussion than myself, and enjoying longer prospects of activity
in its work. •

A TEST OF SURVIVAL
By Robert H. Thouless
There have been many attempts to prove survival after death which have
taken the form of depositing a sealed envelope containing some object or
message v^'hich the depositor hopes to be able to describe through a medium
after his death. The intention is that the correctness of his description
will be verified by the subsequent opening of the package and if it turns
out to be correct this is taken to be proof that the description came from
him and that, therefore, he must have survived his bodily death. There
are, however, objections to this experiment. It is proof of survival of the
depositor only if it is assumed to be impossible that the medium should
obtain a direct psi cognition (clairvoyance) of the contents of the package.
Since we do not know this to be impossible and indeed have good grounds
for believing it to be possible, a correct description is not completely
satisfactory evidence for the survival of the depositor. There is also the
obvious practical difficulty of knowing when to open the package for
verification. Many different descriptions may come (perhaps through
different mediums) and we do not know which is authentic. Once the
package is opened, the experiment is finished ; no second attempt is
possible. This would be satisfactory only if messages received through
mediums were always unambiguous and always accompanied by un-
questionable proof of the identity of the communicator.
These are obviously difficulties of different kinds. The first makes
doubtful the value of a positive result as a proof of survival ; the second
makes it possible that one might fail to get a positive result even though a
surviving spirit were able to communicate the contents of the package and
were trying to do so. A satisfactory experiment should be, as far as possible,
free from both kinds of difficulty. Ideally, the departed spirit should be
trying to communicate something which could not be known to sitters or
medium by any psi process, and it should be something which can be
recognised as right when it comes however many false attempts have been
made.
I have tried to devise and construct a test which seems to me perfectly
to fulfil the second condition and to come as near as seems at present
practicable to fulfilling the first also. Instead of having an object or
written message in a sealed package, the test I suggest is an enciphered
passage of which the communicator is to supply the key. The enciphered
passage need not be in a sealed package ; I suggest that it should be
printed. Without the key, the passage cannot be read ; the object of the
communicator {i.e. myself after my bodily death) will be to supply the key.
The test of the correctness of the key communicated will be that by its
means the test passage will become meaningful.
The passage I have prepared is the following : CBFTM HGRIO
TSTAU FSBDN WGNIS BRVEF BQTAB QRPEF BKSDG MNRPS
RFBSU TTDMF EMA BIM. It uses one of the well-known methods
of encipherment with a key-word whiqh I hope to be able to remember
253
254 Robert H. Thouless [Part
in the after life. I have not communicated and shall not communicate
this key-word to any other person while I am still in this world, and I
destroyed all papers used in enciphering as soon as I had finished.
My intention is to see whether after my death I can give evidence of my
continued existence by communicating the key necessary for the passage
to be deciphered. It is the key and not the meaningful passage itself that
I intend to communicate. I could not indeed hope to be able to give the
original passage since I have largely forgotten it already and I shall probably
have forgotten even what it was about in a few years ; the key I hope
always to remember. I do not think that any special sittings with mediums
should be necessary. Some members of the Society will have sittings with
mediums in any case, and it is to be supposed that I shall ostensibly come
as communicator to those who know me well. If they will then remind
me of this test and ask me for the key to the cipher, I will do my best to
supply it.
An obvious advantage of this test over the sealed package test is that
any number of attempts at communication of the key-word can be made
and tried out. Testing the truth of a single false communication finishes
the sealed package test, since once the package is opened, its contents are
known. In the present test, on the other hand, a false key may be given
in a communication and may be found to be false by the fact that it does
not give a meaningful interpretation of the passage without, however,
giving any clue as to what is the correct key. The second of the conditions
mentioned above is, therefore, fulfilled.
The other objection to the sealed package test was the possibility of a
correct answer being obtained by psi processes on the part of the medium
or sitters without any necessity for the co-operation of the spirit of the
person who made up the package. Let us consider this difficulty in more
detail.
Assuming that, in the sealed package test, all normal means by which
the medium (or sitters) might know the contents of the package have been
eliminated, there seem to remain two possibilities of paranormal cognitive
processes leading to a positive result of the experiment without the
necessity for supposing that the description of the contents of the package
has been supplied by the spirit of the person who made up the package.
These are : (i) the possibihty that there might be direct psi cognition of
the contents of the package (clairvoyance), and (2) the possibility of psi
cognition of the past mental processes of the person making up the package
(retro-cognitive telepathy).
In the present test, the first possibility is plainly eliminated by the fact
that there is nothing in the enciphered passage itself to be paranormally
cognised. In the sealed package test, an object or message is concealed
in the package. This object or message could be described by the use of
normal perceptual processes if the package were opened and the contents
looked at. The hypothesis of clairvoyance is that the clairvoyant person,
without opening the envelope, can obtain the same information about its
contents as would a normal person by looking at them. There is no
parallel possibility in the cipher test. The enciphered passage is open to
inspection by normal perceptual processes to clairvoyant and ordinary
persons alike, and there is nothing more for a psi process to discover in
175] A Test of Survival 255
the passage itself. The key is in my mind and not in the object. A psi
process which could discover the key must be a cognition of the content
of my mind {i.e. it must be of a telepathic nature).
That someone might discover the key-word by psi cognition of my
thought during my lifetime is undoubtedly a possibility. That would be
merely a nuisance, and would necessitate reconstructing the test on a more
elaborate plan. There might, for example, be a process of double en-
ciphering by two people each ignorant of the key-word used by the other,
or a serial encipherment made by any number of people all ignorant of the
key-words used by the others. It would be far more difficult to bring
such a more elaborate test to a successful conclusion since it would require
a number of independent communications which could not, of course, be
obtained until all the collaborators in the test had died. It does not,
therefore, seem desirable to complicate the test in this way until the
necessity for it is proved.
More serious is the difficulty that it is conceivable that there might be
the possibility of a psi cognition of the key-word after my death even
though nothing of my mind survived my bodily death. Plainly such a
psi cognition must, in this case, be retro-cognitive {i.e. a knowledge of a
past process in my mind), but there seems reason for supposing that retro-
cognitive telepathy is a possibility.
I do not see how any test can be devised which completely eliminates this
possibility. There is, however, a way in which such an explanation of a
positive result can be rendered very improbable. I suggest that repeated
attempts should be made during my life-time to obtain information as to
the key-word through mediums. Suppose that these were all unsuccessful,
while similar attempts after my death were followed by success. Then it
would be reasonable to conclude that the factor producing success is not
one that exists both before and after my death (the power of medium or
sitters to obtain the key by telepathy) but is the respect in which the two
periods differ—that after my death I am willing to communicate the key.
It is undoubtedly an understatement of the matter to say that the possi-
bility of obtaining the key by telepathy exists both before and after my
death if my mind vanishes at the time of death ; it should be far easier to
obtain knowledge by a psi process from a mind still existing than retro-
cognitively from one that has ceased to exist.
It is, therefore, an important part of the test that attempts should be
made while I am still alive to obtain the key through mediums. I hope
that members of the S.P.R. will co-operate in the test by making such
attempts. I suggest that when this is done, whether or not there is any
response, a note of the fact that the attempt has been made should be sent
to the Research Officer of the Society, so that there may be a record of the
number of attempts that have been made. If there have been a sufficient
number of such attempts during my life and all have been unsuccessful
while an equal or smaller number of attempts after my death have led to
success, the conclusion that the key has been supplied by me as a still
existing communicator and not through a retro-cognitive telepathic process
of the medium or sitters will be very strongly indicated.
A further doubt may be felt as to whether the key might not be found
by the normal process of rational inference, since it is commonly supposed
R
256 Robert H. Thouless [Part
that a sufficiently skilled cipher expert can decipher any passage without
knowing the key if he is given long enough time. This idea is, howeverj
erroneous unless certain conditions are fulfilled. The cipher must be a
simple one (such as a mono-alphabetic monographic substitution) or else
the passage enciphered must be of considerable length. A short passage
enciphered by a simple type of substitution does not indeed need an expert
;
the reading of such passages is often made a puzzle to amuse children.
A long passage (or a number of passages) enciphered by a more complex
method is more difficult to decipher without knowledge of the key, but it
is said that an expert can do so with messages enciphered by most (but
not all) systems if he is given sufficient time. The passage I have given is
neither enciphered by a simple process of substitution or transposition
nor, I think, long enough for it to be possible to use the methods adapted
for breaking the less simple systems. I do not think that it could be
deciphered by a cipher expert without knowledge of the key while it could
easily be deciphered by anyone with an elementary knowledge of ciphers
if he were told the system and given the key.
The possibility of the key being discovered by a cipher expert need not,
however, depend on my opinion. The enciphered passage is open now to
any who have expert knowledge of methods of reading cipher messages. I
hope that members of the Society who know such experts will now, while
I am still alive, submit the passage to these experts. If even cipher experts
cannot discover the key while I am alive, no normal intellectual process
could enable a medium (who is not a cipher expert) to do so after my death.
There is a further possibility which must be guarded against since it
might make the test unworkable. It might prove to be possible for a
sufficiently ingenious cipher expert to discover some system of deciphering
the passage which made it into sense although he was not using my key
and did not make it into the same sense as that of my original passage.
This possibility is suggested by consideration of the fact that by simple
letter transposition, the word honorificabilitudinitatibus has been converted
into an assertion in Latin that the author of Loves Labour Lost was Bacon.
Indeed it is theoretically possible that any short collection of letters could
be made into a sensible passage by a sufficiently ingenious system of
deciphering, even if the collection. were really a random one. One way of
dealing with this difficulty would be to make the passage longer, but
although this would make an arbitrary system of decipherment more
difficult, it would make it easier for a cipher expert to discover its real
meaning. A better way seems to be to define within narrow limits what is
the correct solution. When correctly deciphered my passage will be found
to be an extract from one of Shakespeare's plays. This leaves the solution
too wide for it to enable a cipher expert to be likely to be able to decipher
the passage without knowledge of the key while making it too narrow for
an erroneous system of decipherment to be mistaken for the true one.
Consideration of possible failure of this test to provide rigid proof would
not be complete if we did not mention the possibility of fraud. I might,
while still living, tell a medium or some future sitter what the key-word
was with instructions to produce it as coming from me in a seance after
my death. This is certainly theoretically a possibility and I cannot see
that any form of test would completely exclude it. It is, however, very
175] " A Test of Survival 257
impi'obable for several reasons. First, I happen to be an honest man, and
I think I am known to be scrupulously so in connection with my scientific
work. Secondly, I should have no motive for the deception. Even
supposing that, if I were anxious to prove a case, I should be willing to
employ dishonest means to do so, no hypothesis about my convictions with
respect to survival would seem to give a reasonable motive for cheating
here. I must either believe in survival, or not believe in survival or regard
the matter as doubtful If I do not believe in survival, I shall not want to
produce spurious evidence for its truth, unless for the eccentric and im-
probable reason that I suppose it desirable that men should believe in
survival and am willing to lie to promote this end. If I do believe in survi-
val, I have good grounds for hoping that the experiment will succeed
without any cheating, and it would be unreasonable for me to try to produce
false evidence. If I regard it as a matter of doubt, I have no motive for
wishing dishonestly to establish a case one way or the other.
The improbability that I would cheat even if I had a motive for doing
so, and the fact that I have no motive make this explanation a very im-
probable one but not impossible. Success of this test would not, therefore,
be coercive proof of survival, since it might be judged by some that
survival was of the same order of improbability as a motiveless deception
by an apparently honest ex-President of the Society for Psychical Research.
It is, however, somewhat unreasonable to suppose that any single test can
produce coercive evidence of anything, since it does not seem possible to
devise a test which does not at some point depend on the reliability of
some person or group of persons. The strength of the evidence need
not, however, depend on a single test. If this test is successful, I hope it
will be repeated. If there were a number of similar successes, the proba-
bility that all were due to a number of independent and motiveless frauds
would become negligibly small.
Finally, let us consider one possible obstacle to the success of any such
test as this if survival is a fact and my surviving spirit is able to communi-
cate through a medium. It may be difficult for the departed person to
remember what he has to communicate. The communicator is sufliering
from the disadvantage that he can no longer have the use of his material
brain. It may well be true that brain traces are not essential to remember-
ing, but there is good reason for supposing that it is by using them that
we commonly do remember. If any of us had formed the habit of
remembering things by recording them in a pocket book and we then lost
the pocket book we should be likely to show many lapses of memory.
We could have trained ourselves to remember by other means, but in fact
we have learned to rely on the pocket book, so its loss is a serious inter-
ference with our capacity to remember. The departed communicator
who has lost his material brain may be in a similar situation, so, although
he can correctly remember a number of things, he may find it difficult to
remember particular things that he wants to remember. I have some hope
that this is likely to prove a less serious obstacle to the present test than to
the sealed package test since the key to a cipher may be more easily
remembered than a message, perhaps of some length, sealed up in an
envelope. But it may happen that I shall find it difficult to remember the
key when I want to communicate it.
258 Robert H. Thouless [Part
In order that my memory may be jogged if necessai-y, I will also deposit
with the Society a sealed envelope which contains a clue which should
remind me of the key although it should not suggest it to anyone else.
I should want this to be opened and the contents communicated to me
only if I failed to give the key without this help. I should indeed very
much hope that this necessity would not arise since the opening of the
envelope would decrease the rigidity of the test. However peculiar to
myself might be the knowledge which led from the contents of the sealed
envelope to the key, it is theoretically possible that anything which
reminded me of the key might also suggest the key to some other person.
Also the opening of the envelope would violate one important condition
of the test—that the situation with respect to both normal and paranormal
means of discovering the key was the same after my death as before
except for the one fact that after my death I should have the intention (if I
survived) of communicating the key to whoever asked for it.
Appendix—A Supplementary Test
It is theoretically possible, although I think unlikely, that a sufficiently
skilful cipher expert may decipher the passage I have given as my first
test without previous knowledge of the key if he works at the problem
hard enough. The cipher system used is not theoretically " unbreakable
"
although the shortness of the passage will be, I hope, an insurmountable
obstacle to the breaking of it. It seems, therefore, worth while to add a
second message in an absolutely unbreakable cipher system, i.e. in one
which cannot be deciphered without knowledge of the key although the
system of ciphering is fully known. A system fulfilling this condition,
which also fulfils the condition that the key can be easily communicated
cannot be a simple one. I will give the passage and then explain the
system used and the kind of key that should be communicated after my
death.
The passage is the following: INXPH CJKGM JIRPR FBCVY
WYWES NOECN SCVHE GYRJQ TEBJM TGXAT TWPNH
CNYBC FNXPF LFXRV QWQL.
The system of the above cipher is based on the Vigenere letter square :
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
.
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza
'
cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab
defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc
efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd
v >
fghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcde
ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzAbcdef

jklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghi
klmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghij
lmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijk
mnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijkl
nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm

PQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
QRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP

STUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQR
TUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS
UVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST
VWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU
WXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV
XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
YZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX
ZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY
The usual method of using this system is to choose a key-word which is
written repeatedly over the passage to be enciphered. The letter used in
the cipher is that found at the intersection of the row starting with the
letter in the original message with the column headed by the letter of the
key-word immediately above it. Thus if the key-word were crab and the
message to be enciphered were There is no death, the process of encipher-
ment would be as follows :
CRABC RA BC RABCR
THERE IS NO DEATH
VYESG ZS OQ UEBVY
which written in the usual five-letter blocks becomes : VYESG ZSOQU
EBVY.
This, however, is far from an unbreakable system since the periodicity
imposed on the enciphered message by the constant length of the key-
iword makes it fairly easy to decipher a not too short passage without
I previous knowledge of the key. This periodicity may be avoided by using
as key a continuous passage of length equal to or greater than that of the
passage to be enciphered, but this also does not avoid the possibility of
breaking the cipher by rational processes, since use can be made of the fact
that both the key and the enciphered passage are meaningful and will have
the frequency characteristics of meaningful material.^
This difficulty may be avoided by using a continuous key composed of
a random sequence of letters. Some way must, however, be adopted of
obtaining such a random sequence by a method which can be communicated.
I have used the following method. Each word in a continuous passage is
replaced by a single letter which is obtained by adding up the serial
numbers of the letters in the word (i.e. i for a, 2 for b, etc.), and then
taking the letter whose serial number is this total or, if the total is greater
than 26, taking the letter whose serial number is the remainder after
I
division by 26, In order to prevent any single letter frequency characteris-
|tics resulting from the varying frequencies of words, all second and later
j
repetitions of words already used are omitted. Words joined by a hyphen
jare treated as two words.
I
Let us, for example, suppose that the key passage is Hamlet's speech
beginning :
" To be or not [to be], that is the question. Whether 'tis
^ I am grateful to Mr D. Parsons and another critic for demonstrating the
possibility of breaking such a cipher.
26o Robert H. Thouless [Part
nobler in [the] mind [to] suffer . .
.". The words enclosed in square'
brackets are repetitions which must be omitted in constructing the key-
letter series. The serial number of i is 20, while that of 0 is 15. 20 + 15 =
35 = 26 + 9 ; the first letter of the key is, therefore, the ninth letter of the
alphabet which is /. Similarly the word be must be replaced by G since
the serial numbers of b and e are 2 and 5 respectively, and the sum of
these is 7, the serial number of G. In the same way " or " will be replaced
by G and " not " by W, and the series of letters goes on : WBGPIVNW,
etc.
If we used this series as key to encipher the passage already discussed,
we get the following result :
Key-letter series : IGGWW BG PI VNWNU
Original passage : THERE IS NO DEATH
Enciphered passage : BNKNA JYCWY RWGB
It is to be noted that any enciphered passage obtained by this process
from a given original could also have been derived from any other original
passage whatever of the same length by the use of a different series of key-
letters. For example, the enciphered passage already obtained BNKNA
JYCWY RWGB might equally well have been derived from the original
passage " Bloaters for tea " if the key-letter series had been ACWNHFH-
KRKADCB. Thus:
Key-letter series : ACWNHFHK RKA DCB
Original passage : BLOATERS FOR TEA
Enciphered passage : BNKNA JYCWY RWGB
From this possibility of a given enciphered passage being derivable
from any original passage by means of some key-letter series, it follows
that a passage enciphered on this system is absolutely unbreakable unless
the key series is known, provided that two conditions are fulfilled : (i)
that the key series of letters is a random one, and (ii) that only one
passage is enciphered by the key series used. The second condition has,
of course, been fulfilled in this test. It is clear that this is necessary since
a cipher expert might theoretically discover the key if he had two passages
enciphered by the same key, since he could utilise the fact that the key
series was one which gave a meaningful content to both messages and it is
extremely improbable that more than one key series could be found
which fulfilled this condition.
A more difficult question is whether a series of letters obtained in the
way described above is a truly random one. This can only be settled by
finding out how closely the conditions for randomness are fulfilled. It is
to be noted that it is not necessary to demonstrate that a long series of
letters derived in this way would show no departure from randomness.
All it is necessary to show is that the series actually used does not show
significant departure from randomness. In the letter series I have used,
I have counted the number of letters which appear once, twice, etc., and
compared these with the expected distributions in a random series. I have
also done the same for the frequency of the first 78 letter pairs. The
expected distributions are those of the Poisson series which are a close
175] A Test of Survival 261
approximation to the more correct logarithmic series. The results are as
follows :
Single letter distributions
Frequency 0123456
Observed 0585313
Expected 1-3 3-9 5-8 5-8 4-4 2-6 1-3
Distribution of letter pairs
Frequencies o i 2 3 >3
Observed 603 '
69 3 i o
Expected 602-5 69-3 4-o- -15 o-o
In both cases it is clear that there is no significant departure from
randomness. The key series is, in the length used, effectively a random
one. The conditions for unbreakability are, therefore, fulfilled.
It is not in this case necessary to give any indication of the nature of the
original passage. The possibilities of arbitrary decipherment are un-
limited, but the distinction between a correct and incorrect decipherment
is sufficiently indicated by the fact that the key-letter series in a correct
decipherment must be a series of letters obtained in the way described
above from some identifiable passage in a printed work. That more than
one such passage would give a meaningful interpretation of the en-
ciphered passage is almost infinitely improbable. My aim will be to
indicate after my death the passage from which the key series of letters
has been derived.
I think it should be regarded as strong evidence for my survival if I
manage to communicate the key for either passage after my death, if also
attempts made by similar methods before my death have failed. It would
be still better if I could communicate both, particularly if they were
communicated through difli^erent mediums to different sitters.
I have already suggested that this test should not depend on any single
communicator, and that it would be worth while for other members of
the Society to prepare similar ciphered passages to which they may hope
to supply the key after their deaths. It has been suggested to me by Mr
D. Parsons that my method of encipherment may involve too much
calculation to appeal to other members of the Society, and he suggests a
simpler method. This would still use the Vigenere square but the key-
letters would be obtained by taking the third letter of every word in the
key passage, words of three letters or less being ignored. Thus from the
passage :
" To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer . . .", one would derive the key series AEEBNF, etc.
This would not be a truly random letter series since single letter fre-
quencies would be much the same as those of ordinary meaningful
material. On the other hand, frequencies of two letter and three letter
combinations would probably be near enough to randomness to be of no
help in breaking the cipher. While, therefore, not demonstrably un-
breakable, this system would probably give a cipher not breakable in
practice provided that the passage enciphered was not too long, and the
key series was not used more than once. Those intending to make this
7 > 7
I o
262 Robert H. Thouless [Part
test should also consider ease of remembering and communicating in
making choice of the key passage.
Additional note. I have received some remarks on my second passage
from a cipher expert. He agrees that a passage enciphered with a truly
random letter series as key would be theoretically unbreakable. On the
other hand, he considers that, although a short simple message enciphered
by my system is likely to be secure in practice, it is not theoretically un-
breakable. He suggests two possibilities of breaking : (i) by listing the
commonest words in the English language with their letter equivalents
and combining these with the commonest plain-text letters, or the
commonest word pairs combined with the commonest plain-text letter
pairs ; (2) by considering that the person making the cipher is more
likely to choose passages from some sources than others, e.g. the Bible or
Shakespeare is a safe bet, and a team of people working for a long time
could try out the whole of the Bible and Shakespeare. I think it is clear
that the second method would take a far longer time than anyone is going
to devote to this task. To work through Shakespeare and the Bible would
take a number of man-years to be reckoned in centuries without mechanical
aid, and it would be large even with mechanical aids. Then it might fail
because the author may not have done the obvious thing but have chosen
a passage from Moliere or the Analects of Confucius. Nor does the first
method seem really practicable for a short passage. The number of possible
two-word combinations is so enormous that a process of trial and error
might be continued for years without any certainty as to any letters in the
enciphered message.
I must, however, agree that the system is not theoretically unbreakable.
It seems to me, however, that all that is important in the test is that the
cipher should not have been broken and, for this purpose, practical
unbreakability is all that is required. I do not, therefore, propose to add
a third passage in a theoretically unbreakable cipher system since I think
it would reduce the chance of the success of the experiment if I tried to
burden my memory with a third key.
In case, however, somebody else wants to try the experiment with a
theoretically unbreakable cipher, I will here suggest a method which the
cipher expert referred to above agrees to be theoretically as well as
practically unbreakable. What is required is a truly random letter series
for key, which however depends on some supplementary key to be
communicated by the spirit of the person making the cipher. This can
be attained by making, first, a random series of letters, and second, a
series derived from some passage in the manner described above, and by
some means combining the two series. Suppose, for example, the random
letter series is : BHRFYJWJBRIATY (derived from a table of random
numbers), while the supplementary key-letter series is that derived above
from " To be or not to be, etc.". These two series can be added together
{i.e. the corresponding numbers can be added and 26 subtracted from the
sum if greater than 26). Thus :
BHRFYJWJBRIATY (random letter series)
IGGWWBGPIVNWNU (letter series derived from key passage)
KOYCVMDZKNWXHT (sum of above two series)
175] A Test of Survival 263
This sum, which is itself a truly random series however great may be
the departure from randomness of the series derived from the key passage,
is then used for enciphering the text in the manner already explained.
If the text to be enciphered is, as before, " There is no death ", the
enciphered passage becomes :
Key letter series : KOYCV MDZKN WXHT
Original passage : THERE ISNOD EATH
Enciphered passage : DVCTZ UVMYQ AXAA
However long the passage might be, it would be absolutely unbreakable
while the random series and the key passage were unknown. It would
also, of course, be unbreakable if the key passage were known but not the
random series. If the random series were known but not the key passage,
the position would be the same as that of my second passage, not theoreti-
cally unbreakable but practically so.
This brings us to the main practical difficulty of this method. It, to
some degree, gives up the advantage of the possibility of repeated attempts at
verification without altering the conditions. For the random series could
not possibly be remembered by the communicator so it must be deposited
in a sealed package at the rooms of the S.P.R. This sealed passage must
be broken after the communicator has ostensibly given the key passage in
order that verification may take place. The random series is then no
longer unknown. I do not think this matters much in practice since the
opening of the sealed package containing the random series could be done
by a few responsible officials of the Society who would seal it up again
without making a copy and who would not try to remember it or be at all
likely to succeed if they did try. So the position for a second attempt at
verification is virtually the same as for the first. The business of verifica-
tion would, of course, be much more trouble than by the method I am
using.
Since I am trying to encourage other people to carry out this experiment
as well as myself, I ought perhaps to emphasise that it is a necessary condi-
tion of unbreakability that only one message should be enciphered with
one key. Even a random letter series would not give an unbreakable
cipher if the same letter series were used to encipher more than one
message. I should also perhaps add that the cipher expert comments on
the system proposed by Mr Parsons (deriving a key from the third letters
of words in a running text) that, in his opinion, it would be quite insecure.

THE INVESTIGATION OF SPONTANEOUS CASES
By D. J. West
INTRODUCTION
Psychical research can be divided conveniently into three classes of
investigation : experimental E.S.P., mediumship and spontaneous pheno-
mena. The last group—which includes premonitory dreams and visions,
death wraiths, hauntings and the like—is in many ways the most instructive
and certainly the most exciting.
In ordinary sciences, planned experiment has replaced passive observa-
tion. In psychical research, analysis of spontaneous happenings plays a
large part still, for the simple reason that we are as yet so ignorant of the
nature of apparitions that they cannot be produced at will for the purpose
of experiment.
This cardinal fact tends to be overlooked in discussion on the evidence
for the supernormal, in which mediums and experiments are given
prominence, while spontaneous phenomena are forgotten. In point of
fact, spontaneous cases have been known and commented upon through
history, long before experiments were thought of and before anyone had
heard of a medium. It is in such cases that the clearest instances of
apparent telepathy have been recorded, and we certainly cannot afford to
neglect them while experimental work is yielding such uncertain results.
Arguing from the analogy of other sciences, it would be natural for the
early psychical investigators to regard the collection of cases as no more
than a means of drawing attention to the possibility of E.S.P. No doubt
they thought that experiment would confirm the stories they had collected.
Nowadays it is clear that the results of experimental work are meagre
compared with what is reported in spontaneous incidents.
It is important, therefore, that spontaneous cases should be investigated
with a view to obtaining clear-cut independent evidence for the paranormal.
In discussing spontaneous cases with people who have read reports in
Proceedings and Journal, the present author has been surprised by the
wide difference of opinion on their cogency as evidence for the super-
natural. One reader of Mrs Sidgwick's collection of cases in Proceedings,
Vol. XXXIII, said she could never doubt again, but another, equally
intelligent and scientific in outlook, said he was bitterly disappointed to
find the famous S.P.R. cases so pitifully inadequate.
264
[Part 175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 265
The reason for this wide difference in the assessment of case reports is
the difficulty of deciding what allowance should be made for normal
possibilities, such as chance coincidence and unconscious exaggeration.
The investigator cannot influence the course of the phenomena, he cannot
control the circumstances in which they occur, his role is in fact hardly
more than an amanuensis for the people whose experiences he is studying.
However well set out the material of the final report, the fact remains that
it is based upon the testimony of unskilled observers who are often
emotionally implicated in the phenomena they describe. In such circum-
stances it is extremely difficult to form a balanced judgment. Some
people discount far more than others, and it is impossible to say who is
right.
It will be seen that the obstacles in the way of making out a water-tight
case for the supernormal on the basis of spontaneous incidents are
formidable. In this paper, some of these obstacles are considered in
detail, with the purpose of finding out how far they have really been met
already by past records, and what else is needed in the way of investigation
before the present prima facie case can be said to be scientifically estab-
lished. It is too much to expect any sort of post-mortem analysis of
controversial questions of evidence to result in general agreement, but that
should not stop us studying the pros and cons of the situation and trying
to formulate a reasoned policy for future research.
There is need for a survey of this kind. Since the Society for Psychical
Research was founded over three-score years ago, many avenues of
investigation have been explored and countless facts collected. Although
an enormous body of evidence has been built up, it is unfortunately not
very accessible. The results of many years of patient labour are bound up
with innumerable arguments and counter-arguments, criticisms and counter-
criticisms, forming a great mass which is scattered among some eighty
packed volumes of Proceedings and Journal.
If we are to appreciate the meaning of all this material, if we are not to
lose sight of the general trend, we need from time to time to review the
position and take stock of the salient lines of evidence.
PART ONE .
'
PRECOGNITIVE DREAMS
Precognitive dreams deserve treatment in a separate section because the
problems of evidence involved are rather different from those in other
types of cases.
In the first place, the precognitive dream is by far the commonest
reported psychic incident at the present time. This has not alwavs been
so. The records of fifty years back are predominantly apparitions of the
dying, but since then the emphasis has transferred from apparitions to
dreams.
In Proceedings, Vol. XLII, p. 94-98, there is a list of all the cases of
precognition printed by the Society for Psychical Research. Some of
these precognitions came as dreams, others were in the form of hallucina-
266 D.J. West [Part
tions. If this list be divided into two equal parts, the ratio of hallucinations
to dreams in the first chronological half is twice what it is in the second half.
It may be that the change is only apparent. Early investigators were
inclined to dismiss dream cases as unevidential, and it is possible that
many more cases were actually reported at that time than the published
records suggest. If there really has been a change, it may be due to
people taking more notice of their dreams as a result of the attention paid
than in psycho-analytic literature. Whatever the reason, the fact is that
the majority of cases sent to the Society of Psychical Research nowadays
are dreams.
An interesting point about psychic dreams is that they are so often
claimed as precognitions. Other kinds of psychic experience, particularly
the apparitional cases, are usually said to coincide with some internal event
rather than to precede it. The common saying, " you've broken my
dream ", is an expression of the widely held idea that dreams anticipate
the dreamer's future experience.
The outstanding argument against allegedly precognitive dreams has
always been that of chance coincidence. Millions of people are having
dreams every night and it would be surprising indeed if now and then
they did not correspond with a future event. In his analysis of dream
cases, (i),^ Saltmarsh disposes of this argument very briefly. "Although,"
says Mr Saltmarsh, " millions of people dream every night, comparitively
few remember their dreams, and still fewer have dreams of the very
impressive character which so often marks the premonitory cases."
This is not a very satisfactory counter-argument. For one thing, many
apparently precognitive dreams are in no way different from ordinary
dreams. They are only recognised as precognitive after they have been
fulfilled. It is true that the majority of dreams are forgotten very quickly,
but those that happen to " come off " will be more fixed in the mind and
retained much longer. The very fact of paying attention to dreams and
looking for a precognitive element, will cause them to be remembered
more easily. In certain cases, it mdy be that a chance resemblance recalls
a dream that would otherwise have been permanently forgotten. These
points are well illustrated by a lady correspondent who wrote to us in
May, 1947 after hearing broadcast on precognition by Professor Broad.
She wrote as follows :
" I have had [precognitive] dreams for many years—since 13 or 14
years of age ... I am now 44. . . .
" I dream very extensively every night and can remember details for
many years. Naturally it is not until the event fulfils the dream that I
recognise it—one could not walk about expecting every dream to come
true."
The correspondent was asked if she would make a note of her more
striking dreams and post them to the Society before the fulfilments. To
this suggestion she replied :
" I feel it would be very difficult to send an account of a dream before
the event—as it would mean keeping a day to day account of every dream
one had—just in case one should be fulfilled.
^ Figures in brackets refer to the list of sources given at the end of this paper.
175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 267
" It is not usually the most striking ones that come true. . . . Some
people might say that it is all coincidence—but apart from the fact that
they happen too often to be coincidences—there is the feeling that goes
with them [when they are fulfilled].
" As a young child I always used to think I had done the things before
—
but when I got to the age of 14 or 15 I got it more clearly and realised that
I had dreamed it before."
This last comment, about the feeling of going through an experience
that has happened before, raises another point. There is a common
illusion of memory—referred to as the sense of deja vu, (2), which is a sort
of false recognition—the person thinks he has seen the situation before
when, in fact, he has not. It is a recognised phenomenon of mental
illness, (3), but also occurs in the normal person in states of fatigue. The
present writer has experienced the illusion when on occasions a person
has said something to him which he felt he had heard before. Without
asking a direct question, it has been impossible for him to tell whether the
sentence had been repeated because of his inattention, or whether it was
actually being spoken for the first time. It is possible, when a person
remembers a dream for the first time on encountering the reality, that the
memory is a false one—a case of deja vu.
To return to the other points in the letter, this particular dreamer is
quite clear that her premonitory dreams are no different in quality from
her other dreams. In this she is in agreement with most dreamers. The
dream which is unusually vivid, almost an hallucination, is the exception
rather than the rule in precognitive cases.
Again, this particular lady says she remembers her dreams well, and that
is the experience of quite a number of the people who report precognitive
cases.
In assessing reports of precognitions, the scope for chance coincidence
is very wide if the premonitory impression does not come in some form
that is exceptional for the person concerned. Otherwise, the suspicion is
that the reported case which was fulfilled is a selected coincidence from a
large number of instances which were not fulfilled. It is important to
bear in mind that when the premonitory impression is said to be of a vivid
and exceptional character we have only the unsubstantiated word of the
percipient for it. Although a very vital point in the chain of evidence, it is
one on which corroboration is by the nature of things impossible.
From the point of view of critical assessment, therefore, we are more or
less bound to regard all dream fulfilments as drawn from an indefinitely
large population of non-veridical cases.
Mr Saltmarsh, in discussing further the hypothesis that dream fulfil-
ments are only chance coincidences, says that even supposing there are
millions of dreams remembered, the number of subjects which may be
dreamed about is practically infinite. The chances that any particular
subject will enter into a dream on any particular night is very small.
Now this is a doubtful argument. The fact that a particular subject is
unlikely to be dreamt at a particular time has little bearing on the question.
Even taking one individual, if he has the usual quota of dreams, and a good
many waking experiences, there are bound to be some chance fulfilments in
268 D.J. West [Part
the course of a lifetime. In actual fact, there are thousands, if not millions
of people having dreams every night, and the chances are correspondingly
multiplied. It is difficult to realise how large an allowance must be made
for chance coincidence. The simple experiment of reading an article and
listening to a broadcast talk simultaneously will show how often quite
startling correspondences are produced by chance.
It is sometimes said, where a dream is mentioned to an independent
person before its fulfilment, that this rules out the possibility of chance
coincidence. We know then that the case has not been selected from a
number of dreams, only one of which was fulfilled. The fallacy in this
argument is that the dreamer may be in the habit of relating her dreams
to different people, in which case it is still possible that the reported case
has been selected. Only if a number of dreamers all send their predictions
to a single authority—the Society for Psychical Research for instance
—
could a reliable assessment be made. In that event, it could be possible
for the authority to publish an unselected collection of predictions and find
out what proportion had come true.
Unfortunately, this ideal is hardly ever realised in practice. Like the
correspondent who has been quoted, most dreamers, however sure they
may afterwards claim to have been about their premonition, hardly ever
think of sending their prediction to the Society. However, there are a
few cases in which predictions based upon psychic impressions have been
depositied with the S.P.R. before fulfilment.
The present writer has found 32 such cases in the S.P.R. files. Not all
were dream cases, but that does not matter for our purpose. The interest-
ing thing is that not one of the predictions deposited with the Society
came true ; even though some of the people making the prediction were
supposed to be almost invariably correct in their forecasts. Various
predictions related to the two great wars. There were eight false predic-
tions of the time the 1914-1918 war would end, and two about the end of
the 1939-1945 war. Two psychic predictions sent up in 1938 were to the
effect that there would be no war. There was one incorrect forecast of
the circumstances of Hitler's death. Nine forecasts of horse racing
winners made in 1946 and 1947 were all wrong. During 1938 and 1939
one lady sent up a great number of forecasts of horse races, but with only
chance results. Two predictions related to political events which never
materialised, one of them asserting, with extreme confidence that Great
Britain would have a general election in 1946. There were three unfulfilled
predictions of deaths, one of marriage, one of meeting a certain friend at
a club and one of winning a large sum on the football pools.
A negative finding of this sort lends support to the theory that published
instances of precognition would be reduced to statistical insignificance if
anyone were able to collect all the unfulfilled premonitions. The best
way to settle the matter would be for more people to post their premonitory
impressions to the Society as soon as they are received. A request to this
effect is now sent to every person who presents the Society with an account
of a fulfilled precognition.
Another way to tackle the problem of selection is for individuals to
record their dreams immediately on waking, to take particular care to
preserve all their notes, an to find out what proportion of their recorded
lys] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 269
dreams comes true. This procedure was actually carried out by J. W.
Dunne and reported in his book An Experiment with Time. Mr Dunne
has, however, been criticised because he refused to acknowledge the
necessity for certain elementary precautions in the collection of evidence
for the supernormal. The experiment was repeated in 1933 under the
auspices of the Society of Psychical Research, when a number of people
were persuaded to keep a record of their dreams. 430 records of dreams
were collected, but the result in no way confirmed Mr Dunne's conten-
tions (4). The Dunne experiment gained wide publicity, and by all accounts
it has since been tried by a good many people. The fact that no successes
have been published rather suggests that Mr Dunne's " experiment ",
like so many other experiments in psychical research, is not repeatable.
It would need to be done by someone who was in the habit of experiencing
apparently precognitive dreams before any positive result could be
expected ; but it is an experiment well worth doing under properly
controlled conditions.
Retrospective investigation of cases reported after the fulfilment can
never properly dispose of the chance coincidence hypothesis, but it
is possible to imagine an example in which so many unlikely details are
fulfilled as to provide a strong prima facie argument against chance co-
incidence, however many unfulfilled cases there may have been. For
instance, if someone were killed in unexpected circumstances, and it were
found that this was in fulfilment of a prophecy which gave the name of the
person, the hour of his passing, and described in detail the unusual manner
of his death, that would be, to say the least, strongly suggestive of pre-
cognition. In all the reported cases, however, there are few, if any, which
come up to this standard of perfection.
A case which is as good as any one comes across in the literature was
that reported by Dr Tenhaeff, in which a Dutch lady foresaw in a dream
the motor accident in which Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands was
injured in 1937 (5). The percipient, Mrs B., said to be a very simple
person, wife of a house-painter, consulted Dr Tenhaeff on the advice of
some friends. She was in a state of nervous tension which some people
had attributed to developing mediumship.
Ten days after the interview with him, Dr Tenhaeff received a letter
from Mrs B. in which she related a vivid dream that had come to her the
previous night. In her dream she saw a motor accident at a level crossing.
A car, which was in a hurry to cross, burst a tyre and ran into a lorry and
a gate. Someone was killed outright and she saw it was Prince Bernhard.
Two days later Prince Bernhard did, in fact, meet with a motor accident.
The circumstances were not quite as in the dream. The accident was not
fatal and there was no burst tyre or level crossing. On the other hand,
the Prince's car did, in fact, collide with a lorry which had emerged from a
gate at the foot of an embankment in front of a railway viaduct.
This case is good, both on account of the corroborative evidence and
because of the seeming improbability of a chance fulfilment. Some people
would say it was sufficient proof of precognition, others would say it was
not. Dr Tenhaeff tells me he " has asked a great many people to record
their dreams " so that we must regard this as a particularly striking
instance selected from a large number of cases. Then again. Prince
270 D.J. West [Part
Bernhard was known to be a fast driver, and many people in Holland
may have had dreams of such a disaster. One only hears of this particular
case because it happened to take place a day or two before the accident.
That the details of the dream were vaguely similar to the actual occurrence
may well have been pure chance. And so the argument goes on ad
infifiitum.
Another very striking case of premonition of accidental death was sent
to the Society by Mrs Schweizer in October, 1882 (6). The premonition
concerned the accidental death of her son Frederick in July, 1882 when
he was thrown from a horse and fatally injured. Eight days before the
accident, Mrs Schweizer had a dream that she was walking along the cliff
edge of a sea-front with her son Frederick and a stranger a little in advance.
She saw her son slip and fall down the cliff, gazing up at her in anguish as
he did so.
In her dream, Mrs Schweizer approached the man who was with her
son and asked his name. " Henry Irvin," he answered. " Do you mean
'
Henry Irving, the actor? ' " she asked.
Mrs Schweizer was very worried and told her elder son John about the
dream. Frederick was at the time in business in Manchester, but instead
of coming home when he had finished, he proceeded to Scarborough for a
holiday. While there, Frederick Schweizer was introduced to a Mr
Henry Deverell, and they went out riding together one afternoon. It was
on this occasion that the accident happened, but it was a fall from a horse
and not down a cliff" as in the dream.
Mrs Schweizer visited the spot and spoke to Mr Deverell, who she
recognised as the stranger in her dream. When she told him about it, he
appeared much affected and explained that although his real name was
Deverell, he took part in private theatricals at which he was invariably
introduced as Henry Irving, junior.
Now this prediction is striking enough to make anyone stop to think.
Chance coincidence is clearly possible, but seems remote. The real point
at issue is whether the account is accurate and well corroborated.
The version quoted here was sent to the Society by Mrs Schweizer three
months after her son's death, and she had already given particulars to the
journal Light. The essential features of the case were so clear cut and
dramatic it does not seem probable that her account could be substantially
different from what actually took place.
A search through the original records of the S.P.R. files revealed that
several investigators had interviewed Mrs Schweizer, including both
Myers and Gurney (the latter only a day or two before his death). It
seems that the whole family was spiritualistic. Mrs Schweizer said that
for years after her husband's death he seemed to accompany her in her
walks. Her three sons were all mediums and on the day of Fred's burial
both his brothers were " controlled " by his spirit. Mrs Schweizer
described many other dramatic experiences. Psychic visions and striking
experiences with mediums were common with her. Eglinton had given
seances at her house.
A history of this kind usually means unreliable witnesses, but all the
investigators seem to have been impressed by Mrs Schweizer and to have
accepted the case without reserve.
175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 271
For corroboration Mrs Schweizer says that her son John and Henry
Deverell both signed an account written by her, and substantially the same
as that given to the Society. This other account, obviously a most import-
ant document, was never sent to the Society and none of the investigators
mention seeing it. This is a serious deficiency, and hardly remedied by
I John Schweizer's letter of July, 1884, in which he gives consent to his
name being used in connection with the case.
There seems to have been some confusion over the name Irvin, which
! Mr Myers said was really Irvine, but that is perhaps not a very important
slip. The important point is that the entire case rests upon the accuracy
and truthfulness of the narrator, Mrs Schweizer and of her son John, who
was the only person who could testify to hearing about the dream before
the accident happened. In view of what is known of the excessive un-
reliability of human testimony in psychic matters, this is not enough.
The Schweizer case has been quoted and discussed at length here because
I
it is the best example of apparent precognition that the present writer has
been able to discover. Even this exceptional case is not quite conclusive.
The fact is, the perfect case is a myth. There is always a flaw somewhere,
either in the circumstances of the experience or in the supporting evidence.
Every case in which there is the slightest flaw can conceivably be due
to faulty reporting. This will always be the trouble until we have suflicient
records of premonitory impressions sent to us before the fulfilment,
to enable the argument to be refuted. In future investigations, this
should be kept clearly in view. No opportunity should be lost to impress
upon the public the importance of posting to the Society for Psychical
Research, accounts of vivid dreams or impressions—which might turn
out to be precognitive—as soon as they are received. If the impression is
strong enough for the percipient to tell other people about it at once (as is
often the case, according to the published accounts), there is no reason
why he should not also tell the Society.
One cannot do better in this connection than quote the words of Mrs
Henry Sidgwick given at the end of her paper on premonitions, published
in 1888 (which contained the case just quoted). So little have we progressed
since then, that her words are as applicable to the situation at the present
time as they were when she wrote them :
" It is clear from our evidence that many people, rightly or wrongly,
believe themselves to have tolerably frequent premonitions. Here,
perhaps, lies our best hope of obtaining certainty, one way or another, on
this at present perplexing question. These persons have it in their power
to make a quasi experimental investigation of the subject. If they could
make a point of recording before fulfilment all dreams or other experiences
which appear to be premonitory—their records would, in a few years, go
far towards settling the question whether genuine premonitions exist or
no."
Of course, there are many more difliculties than that of eliminating
chance coincidence, although a lot of space has been devoted to this
aspect because of its particular application to dream cases. There are
several other snags attached to the investigation of dreams, some of them
inherent in the subject matter of the premonitions.
s
272 D.J. West [Part
In his analysis of published instances, Mr Saltmarsh observed that:
about 34 per cent, of precognitive dreams were related to deaths. In the
search for evidence this is a disadvantage if one only hears of the dream
;
after its fulfilment, for all who have studied normal dreams are agreed that i
death is a common topic. On the other hand, it becomes an advantage if
the prediction is sent in before the fulfilment, because the probability of
the death of a healthy individual within a given space of time can be
estimated roughly from insurance statistics.
In the case of a prediction of accident or death, if the person involved
is told about it, he may develop a subconscious apprehension which brings
about his own undoing.
A case that might well have been caused in this manner is the follow-
ing (7):
In February, 1921, a lady had a dream of her husband breaking his arm
and collar-bone. Next day, when he was setting off on a fox-hunt, she
told him her dream and asked him to take care. At the first fence his
mare stumbled and he sustained a fracture—-dislocation of his arm, but
not his collar bone. He denied being worried, or even thinking about his
wife's dream.
In this case there is a second possibility. The wife herself may have \
been apprehensive. We are not told whether the gentleman was a reckless \
rider, in which case the wife might have had some cause for anxiety. In i
certain predictions of death it may be that some hint has been picked up
normally which later comes out in the form of a dream. For instance,, in
another case (8), a lady dreams of her fiancee's death a day or two in advance
of its actual occurrence. Although she was with him only the day before
his death, she noticed nothing wrong, and she and her family had no idea !
that he was not in the best of health. The cause of death was angina
pectoris. It seems likely that during their association the lady must have
observed some signs of ill-health in her fiancee. Possibly their significance
was too awful for her to recognise them fully in her waking state.
Another fairly common topic for premonitory dreams, on an altogether
different plane from death, is the horse-race. In conversation it is not
uncommon to hear of people dreaming of winners of races, but this is not
the kind of case that often finds its way into psychic literature. Even
more than in the case of deaths, horse-racing predictions have the
advantage that there is available a rough assessment (starting odds) of the
probability of chance fulfilment.
The great difficulty, of course, is that there must be so many people
dreaming of horses just before an important race some of the dreams are
bound to come true. In an amusing contribution to the Proceedings (9) an
editor of an Australian paper recounts how faith in prophetic dreams grew
to such an extent that people used to take heavy pork dinners in the hope
of inducing dreams in which they would foresee the winner of the
Melbourne Cup. On a very different footing is the case of a Quaker, Mr .
J. H. Williams, who had a vivid dream in which he foresaw correctly the
first two horses of the 1933 Derby. (10) Mr Williams said he had no interest
in racing, was opposed to betting, and did not know the names of any of
the horses running. In his dream, which he told to two independent
witnesses before the race, Mr Williams heard, as if in a wireless com-
175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 273
mentary, the name of the winner, Hyperion, and the second, King Salmon.
This sounded a very good case of precognition, but it lost its force when
Mr Beechofer Roberts pointed out that Hyperion started as a favourite,
with King Salmon firmly established as second. If anyone were going to
forecast the result on normal grounds, they might reasonably have
predicted in the same way as Mr Williams's dream.
A much better case, in fact the best instance of racing forecasts the
Society has printed, appeared in the JoMraa/ recently (11). Mr John Godley
had four dreams of winners, all of which came true. Three of the dreams
were well substantiated, in fact considerable profit was made by people
backing his forecasts and the combined odds were significant. Mr Godley
declared that these were the only dreams of the kind he had had. We
have to take his word on that point, but even granting that, the case is still
arguable. The odds were not so long as to exclude coincidence and it is
always possible that John Godley, who studied racing, had picked up
some good hints which came out in the form of dreams. There is no
proof that Mr Godley did not have unfulfilled dreams which were not
sent to the Society. Incidentally, a fifth dream, sent in to the Society some
months later, was not fulfilled.
Once again we see how essential it is that the prediction should be sent
to the Society as it is made. Furthermore, the subject matter must be
such as the dreamer could neither infer by a normal process of deduction
nor bring about by any action of his own.
There is a line of argument, often raised in connection with spontaneous
cases, which purports to prove their supernormality by demonstrating
their consistence of character. On a suggestion of Whately Carington's,
Saltmarsh tried to apply this form of argument to precognitions. He
observed, and demonstrated (by means of a 2 x 2 table and a chi squared
calculation) that the proportion of precognitions relating to deaths was
significantly different in dream cases than it was in cases in which the
premonition came in the form of a hallucination (12).
Granting this interesting difference, it is not clear that it must necessarily
have a supernormal explanation. It may be that very emotional impres-
sions, such as deaths, whether they be psychic impressions or normal
impressions, whether they be fulfilled or not, are specially favourable to
the production of visions and hallucinations. Until it can be shown that
this normal explanation is untrue, Saltmarsh's observation cannot be
claimed as evidence for the supernormal.
In the sections which follow, various other normal hypotheses are
described. Some of these, such as faulty memory, bad reporting, hoaxing
and deception, are also applicable to dream cases. They are dealt with
later for the sake of convenience of arrangement.
PART TWO
APPARITIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS
I. A Classic Example
The appearance of a phantom is a more striking occurrence than a
dream, for the simple reason that it is much more unusual. Like the
274 D.J. West [Part
prophetic dream, the hallucinatory phantom is often said to herald
disaster. The person whose apparition is seen may be at the point of death,
or undergoing some terrible crisis, at the very moment that his apparitional
double is making its appearance elsewhere. Such cases, known in the
literature as death coincidences or crisis apparitions, are much more
convincing than dreams ;
they are, in fact, the very back-bone of the case
for the supernormal. Where the percipient is expecting nothing, and both
the ap]>arition and subsequent news of the death come as a complete
surprise, some sort of psychic linkage seems an obvious inference.
An example of a classic death wraith is that of Lieutenant David E.
M'Connel, R.A.F., whose apparition was seen by a fellow officer on
December 7, 1918, at almost the very moment he was killed in an aero-
plane crash (13).
David M'Connel was aged 18. He had been given the job of flying a
" Camel " scout plane to Tadcaster, 60 miles from his own station. He
was accompanied by another flyer in an " Avro " plane. They ran into
fog on the way. M'Connel kept going, although his companion made a
forced landing. Hours later he reached Tadcaster, only to be killed
instantly in a nose-dive crash while preparing to land. The time of his
death was given by his wrist-watch, which was found stopped at 3.25 p.m.
Back at M'Connel's camp-room, at the aerodrome at Scampton,
Lieutenant Larkin was smoking and reading by the stove fire. Some-
time between 3.20 and 3.30 p.m. Larkin heard a familiar clatter approach-
ing and M'Connel's voice calling out " Hello boy! " Larkin turned in
his chair and saw M'Connel standing half in and half out of the room,
holding on to the door knob. He remarked that he had had a good trip,
and then closed the door and went out.
At 3.45 p.m. Lieutenant Garner-Smith came in and said, " I hope
Mac gets back early." Larkin told him he had already arrived. When
that evening Larkin learned that M'Connel had been killed he could not
at first believe it.
This is probably the best case of its kind in the Society's collection.
Lieutenant Garner-Smith confirms that Larkin told him of M'Connel's
apparent visit only twenty minutes after its occurrence, and before either
could have known of the death. Any ordinary explanation seems highly
unlikely, although several possibilities are cenceivable.
The rest of this paper is concerned with non-psychic factors in such
cases. It will be of interest to see how many of these normal hypotheses
can be applied to the M'Connel case ; for it is obvious that all counter-
hypotheses must be disposed of before assuming that the true explanation
is supernatural.
n. Fraud
Hoaxing is often advanced as an explanation of psychic stories. It is
a difficult charge to refute, for it must be admitted that in the collection of
spontaneous psychic experiences the investigator has little protection
against being led astray by wilful deception. In the M'Connel case, for
.instance, if Lieutenant Larkin, who said he saw the apparition, and the
friend who confirms his statement were for some reason not speaking the
truth, there would be no need for further explanation.
lyj] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 275
Of course, pure lying seems an improbable explanation in any particular
case, although there is no doubt that that is what sometimes happens.
In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to detect, because of the
lack of obvious motive, other than the pleasure of deception for its own
sake, or the desire to foist bogus " experiences " upon an unappreciative
scientific world.
An extraordinary instance of pointless deception was the case of Mr
! and Mrs Brown (pseudonyms) who set out to hoax the S.P.R. with some
spirit messages (14).
Mr and Mrs Brown called at the S.P.R. rooms in July, 1922 and said
that they had been attending a private circle at which some veridical
communications had been received from an unknown French soldier. Mr
Jones, at whose house the sittings were held, wrote to the S.P.R. at Mr
Brown's instigation. He explained that- the circle consisted of himself,
his wife, his sister, and Mr and Mrs Brown. Remarkable phenomena had
been obtained, including raps and the overturning of a 25-lb. table without
contact. The most interesting incident, however, was the French soldier
communication
.
In October, 1922 Mr Brown and Mr Jones were interviewed by Miss
Newton, at that time the Secretary of the S.P.R. They gave her notes
of the sittings and also some relevant correspondence.
According to the sitting notes for April 22nd, 1922 communications
were received in French from one Bernard Lebecq (pseudonym) who
stated that he was a soldier killed in the war and came from the town of T.
in France. On July 8th he came again, gave the name of his regiment, and
said he had been a wine dealer and had died at the age of 35 on July 3rd,
19 1 6. He asked the sitters to write to an address in T. and tell his mother
that Jean was happy.
Among the documents tendered was a copy of a letter from Mr Brown
to Mme Lebecq. The reply was postmarked "Paris, July nth", and
was signed " Emille C. ". Monsieur C. stated that Mme Lebecq was
blind and almost out of her mind and that the loss of her two sons Jean
and Bernard in the war had left her without any family.
There was a copy of a second letter in which Mr Brown explained the
circumstances and asked for details of Bernard's birthplace, occupation,
regiment, age and date of death. Monsieur C.'s reply came from an
address in Belgium. He was able to give all the required details, and they
tallied exactly with what had been given at the English sittings.
Bernard came through once more at a sitting on July 30th, at which a
Mr Robinson (pseudonym) was present. Mr Robinson asked a friend in
Belgium to make some inquiries about Monsieur C. It was found that
the Belgian address from which Monsieur C. was supposed to have
written was the address of a house destroyed in the war.
A member of the S.P.R. living in France was asked to make inquiries
at T. He discovered that there was no such regiment as the one to which
Bernard was supposed to have belonged. There was no record of any
Bernard Lebecq killed in the war. Mme Lebecq and her address in T.
were likewise both non-existent.
Mr Jones was informed of these findings and he started investigations
on his own account. He confirmed the findings with regard to Lebecq,
276 D.J. West [Part
and showed that Monsieur C. was also mythical. The whole case turned i
out to be an elaborate hoax perpetrated by Mr Brown. The communica-
tions were not veridical and all the supposed verifications were faked.
In apparitional cases, fraud, especially the falsification of documents, is
very difficult to detect. In the following case an attempt at hoaxing the
Society's investigators succeeded and the fraud remained unsuspected
until years later, when one of the participants confessed.
The case was published in Phantasms of the Living (15) accompanied by
lengthy correspondence and the usual collection of confirmatory evidence.
The percipients were interviewed by Gurney, who wrote :
"Personal acquaintance has completely confirmed the impression made on
me by the letters of these gentlemen, that they had observed the phenomena,
which were a complete surprise to them, with intelligence and care."
Thus can appearances deceive even the most experienced of investigators.
The opening letter of the case was from Mr Sparks, who declared he
had been in the habit of mesmerising a fellow student of naval engineering
named Cleave. On Friday, January 15th, 1886 young Mr Cleave said he
would try to make himself appear to a lady friend. Mr Sparks obligingly
put him into a mesmeric trance, during which his apparition was supposed
to have visited the young lady.
Two other students who were present vouched for the truth of the
mesmeric experiment. A letter was produced from the young lady con-
cerned to the effect that the apparition of Mr Cleave had appeared to her.
Long afterwards it was placed on record that Mr Cleave had confessed
that the affair of the apparition was a hoax (16).
This case was as well " authenticated " as most of the S.P.R. collection,
and yet it was a fraud. It is a matter for speculation in how many of the
cases that have been accepted as genuine, fraud remains undetected and
unconfessed.
A recent case of motivated fraud is a psychic story that was told the
present writer in April, 1947 by a friend of his, here called Dr A. The
case is entirely without corroboration, and is given here only as illustration
of the many unsuspected possibilities against which the investigator has
to be on his guard.
Dr A. lived with an elderly aunt. One morning, on coming down to
breakfast he found the aunt crying bitterly. When he asked her what
was the matter, she explained that she had had a horrible dream about
her brother, in which there had been a lot of flames. She was sure that
something had happened to him.
Dr A. dismissed the idea, but when he came to read his mail, he found
a letter telling him of the death of his aunt's brother and explaining that
arrangements had been made for the body to be cremated.
It was indeed a striking confirmation of the dream, and Dr A., although
sceptical about such matters, accepted it as an example of telepathy.
Only afterwards, when he was talking to a friend about it, did he guess the
explanation.^ His old aunt had been worried about her brother. On
^Dr A. did not verify his explanation, which must therefore be regarded as
purely hypothetical. As already explained, this story is only quoted to show what
might happen if the investigator is not on the look-out for unsuspected possi-
bilities.
175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 277
looking through the post one morning, she had seen a letter addressed to
Dr A. in what she recognised as the handwriting of her brother's daughter.
Filled with anxiety she had broken open the envelope and read the letter.
It told of her brother's death, of the arrangements of his cremation, and
advised Dr A. not to trouble his aunt about the matter until all was over.
Ashamed at having opened someone else's letter, the aunt had stuck the
flap of the envelope down once more and said nothing about having read
it. All the same, she had wanted Dr A. to know she was aware of her
brother's' death, so that she could please herself about attending the
funeral. She had therefore invented the tale about the dream.
This is an example of a case nipped in the bud. One can imagine how
easily it might have been mistaken for a psychic incident if Dr A. had been
less observant and had failed to notice the old lady's prior contact with
his correspondence.
It must be understood that examples of this kind are unusual. No
experienced investigator supposes that deliberate fraud accounts for very
many cases of apparitions, and the number who have been " found out
"
is extremely small. The average person who reports a psychic incident
to the Society is all too earnest and sincere, not at all the type of person to
play a practical joke. However, it would be difficult to establish this
opinion, which is a matter of personal judgment, on strictly logical
grounds that would satisfy the resolute sceptic.
III. Mistaken Identity
A proportion of the recorded cases, especially those in which the
apparition was seen out-of-doors or in some public place, may be accounted
for by mistaken identity. The " apparition " is really a living person who
bears an accidental resemblance to the presumed agent.
Our powers of recognition are not infallible, and human features are
never so distinctive that confusion cannot arise. Often enough one hears
the phrase, "I saw your double today." If such an event should happen
to coincide with the death of the person whose double was encountered,
the percipient is very liable to conclude that he has seen a genuine psychic
apparition.
The story reported to the S.P.R. by Professor Macneile Dixon in 1912
is a good illustration of the type of experience that might be a case of
mistaken identity (17).
The incident took place at a London hospital in March, 1912. A
patient mentioned to a nurse one morning that the matron had been in
the ward at about i a.m. She walked in, looked at the fire, and then went
out again. He recognised her by the cap and uniform. The night sister,
before she went off duty, had also been told that the matron had been in
the ward during the night. Two of the patients swore they had seen her.
It could not have been the matron in the flesh that the men had seen,
because the night sister had taken a cup of tea to her room at 12.30 a.m.
The matron said that after the sister's visit she had fallen asleep almost
immediately, and had certainly not been near the ward in question.
Mrs Sidgwick visited the hospital and questioned the matron, the night
sister and the nurse. The patients were no longer available. It was
explained that the matron had been concerned about the coal shortage
278 D.y. West [Part
and anxious to be as economical as possible. This may have been the
reason for her apparition seeming to take such an interest in the ward fire.
The evidence for the supernormal here is very flimsy. Granted that
matrons wear a different head-dress from ordinary nurses, might not the
figure have been some unfamiliar sister or perhaps an assistant matron,
with a slightly different uniform? This aspect of the case does not appear
to have been investigated very conscientiously.
Another explanation is that the figure really was the matron. The idea
of coal fires preying on her mind may have brought on an attack of
somnambulism in which she went to inspect the fire in the ward. It is
not mentioned whether the matron was asked if she had ever walked in
her sleep.
This suggestion calls to mind another interesting case (18). The story
runs as follows :
Mr X was a respectable tradesman and president of a small club which
met once a month at a public house at the end of the street in which he
lived. A short time before one of the meetings he was taken very ill.
The club met as usual, and its members left a vacant chair in honour of
their absent president. When the time came to adjourn, they were aghast
by the entrance of an apparition of their president. The figure walked
deliberately and took its place in the vacant chair. Then it looked round
for a short while in silence, rose, and retired, leaving the members to talk
over the strange visitation. Next morning they heard the news that their
president had died at about the time his wraith had appeared to them.
The affair became the talk of the town, and an account was drawn up
and attested before a magistrate. Three years later the old nurse who had
attended Mr X in his last illness made a dying confession. She had left
Mr X to get something from a nearby shop. In her absence, he had got
up and left the house, and she had no doubt but that it was Mr X himself
who had so surprised the members of the club down the street. When he
returned, Mr X collapsed on the bed and died almost immediately. The
nurse had never dared to reveal what had happened for fear of losing her
professional reputation.^
An interesting case was reported in Journal, Vol. X, p. 303, which,
although not psychic, shows the extraordinary situations that can arise as
a result of misrecognition.
Mrs Piddington had invited a friend to lunch, but received no reply.
On inquiry it was found that the friend thought she had met Mrs Pidding-
ton in the street and given the reply verbally. This might easily have
been regarded as a telepathically inspired apparition had not Mrs
Piddington's friend met the same lady again and discovered that they had
both mistaken each other for someone else.
In the M'Connel case (quoted at the beginning of this part) the appari-
tion was so realistic that it might have been an example of mistaken
identity. In favour of this explanation is the fact that the figure appeared
at a base where there would have been other young airmen wandering
about. Against it are the facts that Larkin knew M'Connel very well by
' No original authority or confirmatory testimony is put forward in connection
with this case, which must therefore be regarded as purely illustrative.
175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 279
sight, that the figure appeared only a few feet away in a well-Ut room,
that it was wearing what Larkin recognised as M'Connel's special cap
and that it made a remark about the flight.
IV. Deceptive Memory and False Testimony
One feature stands out above all others from a study of memory, and
that is the unreliability and deceptiveness of the faculty. Experience of
the Court Room shows how often a genuine effort at recollection can result
in the depiction of events, not as they actually occurred, but in the way the
witness would have liked them to appear.
Psychological distortion of memory is especially evident in psychic
matters. In reciting a psychical experience, the narrator tends to remember
in detail, or to exaggerate, points which favour the supernormal, while
completely forgetting points which fit in with a naturalistic explanation.
This unwitting falsification results in more pseudo-psychic cases than
does deliberate fraud. It is a very common mechanism, but the ordinary
literature of psychical research gives the reader no inkling of its extent.
The published cases are only the cream from a much larger number
which either lack confirmation or which investigation exposes as tall
stories. Only about one per cent of the psychic incidents reported to the
Society for Psychical Research can be authenticated well enough for
publication.
A great deal has been written about the unreliability of human testimony
in relation to the physical phenomena of the seance room (19). Fewer people
realise that experiment has shown that observations of ordinary incidents
outside the seance room are almost as faulty (20). Testimony regarding
hallucinations is equally questionable, perhaps more so, the only essential
difference being that the errors are more difficult to detect in the absence
of any objective record.
It is an interesting problem (but one which cannot be enlarged upon
here) why biassed testimony and distorted memories are met with so often
in psychic matters. The question is one of universal yearning after some
sign that human beings are not just the doomed puppets which the brutal
facts of decay and death suggest. The matter has been thoroughly dis-
cussed in an excellent thesis by Dr Lawton (21).
The value of apparitions as evidence for the supernormal lies in their
apparently constant association with death, which argues for something
more than chance coincidence. The first essential in investigation is to
make sure that the alleged coincidence with death is valid, and not just a
trick of memory due to previous expectation. A case in point is that of
Sir Edmund Hornby (22).
It was Sir Edmund's habit to allow newspaper reporters an interview
during the evening to get his Vv'ritten judgments for the next day's paper.
One night the judge was awakened by a reporter entering his bedroom
and asking for a dictated precis of his judgments. The judge indignantly
refused and admonished the reporter for breaking into his bedroom at
half past one in the morning. The reporter refused to go and an argument
ensued.
Fearful of awakening his wife with the commotion, the judge at last gave
in and let the reporter take down in shorthand the gist of the judgment.
28o D.J. West [Part
The man seemed satisfied and left the room. Lady Hornby then awoke,
thinking she had heard voices, and her husband told her what happened.
Next morning news came that the reporter had died as a result of heart
disease at the very moment the judge had been interviewing his apparition.
Beside the body was the reporter's note book. It contained the usual
heading for the judgment, followed by a few lines of undecipherable
shorthand. Investigation showed that the reporter could not possibly
have left his house and visited the judge, who lived a mile and a quarter
away.
This case broke down when a critic pointed out that the reporter's
death had taken place three months before Sir Hornby supposed. The
assertion was verified and Sir Hornby was forced to admit that his memory
had played him a most extraordinary trick with reference to the co-
incidence in time between vision and death (22b).
The census of hallucinations carried out by the S.P.R. at the end of the
last century contains some most interesting figures in relation to biassed
memory in psychic cases (23). The investigators set out to determine what
proportion of spontaneous hallucinations in sane people coincided with
deaths. As a preliminary, they went into the question of the remembering
of non-veridical hallucinations. It was found that reports of non-veridical
hallucinations which they had collected showed a preponderance of
recent cases. Consider the following table :

There was no reason to suppose that hallucinations were really becoming
more frequent with the progress of the years. The obvious explanation
was that non-veridical cases were quickly forgotten. If hallucinations
were easily remembered, each year would contain approximately the same
number of cases, but in point of fact the longer the lapse of time, the
fewer the cases reported.^
It was found that the three separate months of the most recent quarter
year contained an approximately equal number of recognised apparitions,
so that it could be assumed that only a negligible proportion of this type
of case was forgotten within three months. From the number reported in
the last three months, one could obtain a fair approximation to the actual
frequency of cases. It was estimated that the total number reported had
to be multiplied by four to compensate for the ones forgotten.
Very different was the situation of those cases which were claimed as
veridical by the people who had experienced them. Here the bias was in
the opposite direction. The census collection of alleged death coincidences
contained a disproportionately large number of remote cases, a fact which
strongly suggested that many were apocryphal.
The figures of the census show eleven cases of death coincidences said
to have occurred in the preceding ten years. Taking into account the
average age of the census population, this leads to an expectation of 29
cases over ten years old. Actually fifty-one such cases were reported.
It would have been better if the census had been on a larger scale, and
the investigators had had more such cases to work with. It would then
have been possible to take a shorter span of time than ten years for
comparison. If, for example, the investigators had been able to compare
the number of cases occurring in the preceding twelve months with the
total number, an even bigger disproportion might have been discovered.
The census findings prove that the human mind not only quickly
forgets non-coincidental cases, but that in the course of time the ones
that are remembered become embroidered with coincidental features they
did not in fact possess. This conclusion has always been suspected on
common-sense grounds. The census serves not merely to verify the
suspicion, but to give some measure of the extent of the effect.
The obvious remedy is to make it a rule never to accept a percipient's
unsupported word. One should always search for such things as diary
entries and letters and compare the date they bear with the official record
^Further analysis showed that most of the vague auditory or tactile impressions,
which might have been illusions, were forgotten in a matter of weeks. Apparitions
of recognised human forms were remembered much longer, so only that type was
included in census estimate of the proportion of apparitions coinciding with
deaths. Even with this restriction, generous allowance had still to be made for
cases forgotten.
282 D.J. West [Part
of the death. In the M'Connel case, for example, it would be very
difficult to raise deceptive memory as an explanation, because the percipient
and the principal witness are both quite clear that the apparition came
before the news of M'Connel's death, and they both recorded this fact in
writing a week later.
V. Expectancy and Suggestion
Apparitions heralding deaths, such as the M'Connel case that has been
quoted earlier, are striking because of the coincidence in time of two
unusual events. M'Connel could only die once, and that might happen
any time in a life span of seventy odd years. Larkin had probably never
seen an apparition before. The odds against the events corresponding
almost to the minute by chance coincidence are too fantastic to contem-
plate. There must be some causal relationship, probably telepathic.
Thus do most psychical researchers state their case, but as it stands
the argument implies several unwarranted assumptions. First, hallucina-
tory figures by no means so rare as most people imagine. The census of
hallucinations, which will be discussed at greater length in the next
section, showed that ten per cent of normal sane people admit to at least
one hallucination. Actually, hallucinations are far commoner than the
figures would indicate, because of the marked tendency to forget them
very quickly. In this respect hallucinations resemble dreams, most of
which are forgotten either almost immediately on waking or else shortly
afterwards.
Second, the probability of imminent death varies with state of health
and other circumstances. In the M'Connel case, for example, when the
flyer was lost in the fog, one might almost say there was an expectancy of
death.
Third, where the percipient has reason to suppose a death is likely, the
expectancy in his own mind may actually generate the hallucinatory
apparition. In other words, instead of the hallucination representing a
telepathic " message " from outside, it may merely be a " message
"
expressing the percipient's own anxiety.
Expressed like this, the expectancy explanation sounds far-fetched, but
there is considerable evidence that expectancy is a most important factor
in the aetiology of hallucinations.
As will be explained in the next section, the majority of hallucinations
correspond with nothing in particular, and require no explanation from a
psychical research stand-point. Probably they have a physical basis,
although it is as yet obscure. The visions produced by fever or by
mescaline are well known, but how these agents act is something of a
mystery. The highly integrated visions they produce could hardly be due
to a direct nervous stimulation ; more likely they work by so disorganising
the nervous system as to result in inco-ordinate mental fantasies. Sporadic
hallucinations of the type that give rise to psychic cases probably have a
greater psychological element in their genesis.
One noticeable feature is that the percipient (ex. Lieut. Larkin) is
usually sitting quietly at home when the hallucination comes. Apparitions
in busy, crowded places are exceptional.
The content of hallucinations (which are after all only waking fantasies)
175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 283
is probably determined in much the same way as the content of dreams.
If a person is going to have a hallucination, anxiety about a friend may
well cause it to take the likeness of that friend.
In the field of hypnosis, there are abundant examples of hallucinations
produced by verbal suggestion. Similar phenomena have been demon-
strated in the unhypnotised. Alice Johnson has described a very interesting
case (24) of a Mr Griinbaum who was so sensitive that the most casual
suggestion was liable to give him a hallucination. Mr Griinbaum's
experiences started when he made some successful attempts at invoking
visions by autosuggestion. He soon found that visions were coming to
him without any seeking on his part.
On one occasion Mr Griinbaum had been reading—in the S.P.R.
Journal for 191 1 —about sitters feeling touches in the dark in the presence
of a young physical medium. When he went to bed that night, just as
he was on the verge of falling asleep, a thought shot through his mind :
" Shall I touch you a little? " Directly afterwards he felt a blow on the
head and saw a white silhouette of a hand on a black background. He
recognised the hand as being from an illustration in the Annals of Psychic
Science (Vol. I, pp. 210-212).
Still more to the point was an instance in which the suggestion of a
casual phrase in a book brought about a fully-fledged apparition. Mr
Griinbaum had accidentally alighted on an old book on Faust and in
looking through it had come across a magic formula. When he was lying
in bed, the words of the formula flashed through his mind :
" Tetra-
agrammation-Adonai-Agla." Shortly afterwards Mr Griinbaum was
considerably frightened by the appearance of a horrifying Mephisto-
phelian spectre at the foot of his bed. It was a broad figure with vibrating
smoky-blue outlines. There can be no doubt that the hallucination had
been suggested by the magic conjuration.
The census investigators had quite a lot to say about the effects of
suggestion and expectancy. Selected cases were quoted in which there
were clear correspondences between the substance of the hallucination
and the subject occupying the percipient's thoughts : for instance, the
case of Mrs T. E. who, while waiting in a hotel room for her husband, saw
him approach and rose to meet him, only to find that the figure was a
spectre which vanished before her eyes. A similar modern instance,
quoted in Mr Tyrrell's book Personality of Man, happened to Miss Ina
Jephson in November, 193 1 (25). She received a letter from her lawyer
saying he was enclosing a cheque. Not having time to attend to it on
arrival, she took it out with her, peering into the envelope occasionally to
see that the cheque was safely there. When she got home, the cheque
had disappeared, although she was absolutely convinced that she had seen
and handled it shortly before, and could remember its marble pale colours
and the look of the writing on it. She found out afterwards that by an
accident the real cheque had never been enclosed with the letter. The
cheque she had " seen " on looking into the, envelope was an hallucination
brought on by her expectant state of mind. Mr Tyrrell also described a
case in which someone turned on the switch of a wireless and saw the
dial hght up when in fact it was not working at all. A friend of the
present writer reported independently a precisely similar experience.
284 D.J. West [Part
The census investigators described also how sHght normal impressions
may lead to hallucinations through the effect of suggestion. The un-
explained opening of a door might form the nucleus of a phantasmal
experience in which the figure seems to walk into the room. In certain
cases the investigators were able to trace the development of the hallucina-
tion step by step, one percept suggesting and leading on to the next. In
this way, a figure seen first apparently by reflection in a mirror may after-
wards be viewed directly. Apparent physical effects, displacement of
objects, opening of doors, and so forth, are subsidiary hallucinations
suggested by the main percept. Apparitions seem to obey physical laws,
cast shadows, disappear behind screens, and so on, only because the
environment suggests to the percipient that this is what should happen.
In the hypnotic trance the subject's attention is completely taken up with
the hypnotist, so that he is in effect isolated from the suggestions of the
environment. This is the reason why the visions produced by hypnotic
suggestion take hold of the mind with such intensity and exclusiveness
and do not fit in with the surroundings like the typical apparition.
While the cases here quoted are extreme examples, they are supported
in some degree by ordinary experience. For instance, there are the mild
hallucinations which people often experience while waiting for someone.
They may seem to spot the familiar face of the person they are expecting,
only to be disillusioned on closer inspection when the features resolve
themselves into those of a total stranger.
It must be stressed, however, that although expectation and/or sugges-
tion frequently determines the content of a hallucination, expectation is
not always the sole cause of its occurrence. If that were really so, we should
be constantly hallucinated. As Mr Tyrrell points out, people in thousands
every day see and hear things contrary to what they expect, and people
expect and desire intensely without being hallucinated.
The psychical researcher is not so much interested in why some people
sometimes have hallucinations, as why hallucinations when they do occur
should occasionally correspond to. external events. We do not under-
stand the causes of dreams and hallucinations, but we know that their
content can be guided by the beliefs, hopes and fears of the percipient.
This being so, a case cannot be used as evidence for telepathy if the
information presented to the percipient be no more than what he might
have thought out for himself.
'
The following case (38), collected in 1944 by the present author and Mr
D. H. Hyde, another member of the Society, is an illustration of the sort
of experience that can be readily accounted for by the influence of
suggestion.^ The fact that the case presents no veridical features is
curious. One would expect, with a lapse of time of fifteen years between
the apparition and the report, that some sort of apocryphal coincidence
would have been woven into the story.
The percipients were Mr and Mrs H. of Liverpool (full names and
addresses in the Society's possession). Their statements were taken down
in writing, typed out, and then submitted to them for correction and
signature (25).
^ Other explanations are not included, but the one put forward seems to make
the least assumptions.
175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 285
Testimony of Mrs H.
" In 1926 my mother died at the age of 52 as a result of heart failure
following Bright's disease. Some months later, I moved to a new house
and remember feeling that, had my mother been alive, I would have
liked her to have seen it and approved of it. I mentioned this feeling to
a woman friend, who said something about my mother watching over me.
However, I paid no attention to this idea, and by 1929 the feeling had
quite worn off and I had not got my mother on my mind at all. Apart
from the one instance I am going to describe, I have had no other psychic
experiences and I am not a spiritualist.
" In the last week of April, 1929, just about a week before my sister's
marriage, my husband brought me a cup of tea in bed before he left for
work round about 6 to 6.30 a.m. (Mr H. is a tramway superintendent).
I distinctly remember hearing the noise of my husband slamming the
door behind him as he went out. At the very same moment I saw the
handle of my bedroom door turn and the door slowly open. My mother
walked noiselessly straight into the centre of the room and stood about
four feet from the bed.
" The apparition appeared absolutely life-like and real, but I was not
afraid, only surprised. I could see the features clearly, and they were my
mother's. She was wearing a nightgown which I recognised, and I
particularly remember the frills on the cuffs, which seemed to stand out,
though I don't remember the hands. She looked exactly as I remembered
her in health, just before her sudden death. Her hair was sleek and parted
in the centre, which was characteristic. The face was sallow and wore a
pained expression, and there was a handkerchief tied round the forehead.
This was just as she used to look in life when she had one of her frequent
headaches.
" I exclaimed, '
Oh Mum, whatever's the matter? '
I rather think she
shook her head then, but at any rate she replied, '
I'm terribly worried.'
Then she seemed to dissolve away all of a sudden. There was no fading
away, she just vanished.
" I particularly remember noticing and being impressed by the fact that
I found myself sitting up with the cup of tea still balanced on the palm of
my hand, from which I feel certain that I was wide awake. I was so
absorbed with what had taken place that I cannot remember what I did
with the tea or whether it was cold ; nor can I remember whether I found
the bedroom door open afterwards. I rather think it was not, otherwise
I would have noticed it. Had I found it open I would probably have put
it down to the vibration of the front door being slammed. There was no
one in the house except my baby son.
" The incident made a deep impression and left me in an unsettled
frame of mind, but I could not connect what the apparition had said
with anything about which my mother might have been worried, unless
it were my sister's forthcoming marriage. I carried on with some
housework, and when my husband returned at 9 a.m. I told him about
my experience. At 10.30 a.m. the same morning I went to see my sister's
future mother-in-law (now deceased) and told her about it. Then, at
about II a.m., I visited my husband's mother (now deceased) and told
her as well."
286 D.J. West [Part
It will be seen from this account that Mrs H. fully admits that at one
time the idea of her mother's continued presence had been suggested to
her. It is possible that her sister's marriage may have reinforced in her
mind the idea of her mother, who would have been deeply interested in
'
the event. The phrase " I am worried " may have been suggested by a
half-conscious anxiety about the marriage, which actually turned out
unhappily on account of many troubles, medical, financial and tempera-
mental.
The same apparition appeared to Mr H. It was probably suggested by
his wife's prior experience. Mr H. had had psychic experiences before.
The fact that this particular hallucination took place after the wedding
may have been a consequence of Mr H.'s share in the celebrations.
Testimony of Mr H.
" I recollect returning on the morning of my wife's experience. I
think she was sitting at the table eating when I came in. She seemed veiy
quiet and said :
'
I've had an experience. After you left, the bedroom
door opened and mother walked in. She put her hand to her forehead
and said, " I'm terribly worried ", and then vanished. I've been thinking
about it ever since.' I suspected at the time that my wife's experience
might have been the result of health conditions, although she appeared
perfectly well. To prevent any possible bad after-effects, and to stop her
brooding over the matter, I made light of the affair and brushed it away as
soon as possible. However, I took careful note of succeeding events to
see whether anything would happen to justify the apparition's apprehen-
sions, but I noticed nothing.
" My wife's sister was married on the 4th May following, and that night
I shared a bed with my wife's brother in the house in which my mother-
in-law had died. During the night (I afterwards noted it was about 3
a.m.) I felt a very cold hand touch my forehead. I supposed it must have
been my father-in-law come into the room to speak to his son, so I tried
to wake the latter by shaking him with all my strength and saying, 'Your
father is here.' I failed to rouse him, however (Mrs H. stated that her
brother was normally a heavy sleeper), and on looking round I saw the
face and bust of my mother-in-law. The room was pitch dark, but I saw
and recognised the features clearly, as the figure seemed to be illuminated
by a brownish yellow light. The figure gazed at me without moving and
seemed to be rather larger than life-size. The appearance was only
momentary and it vanished suddenly. . . .
" The following night I slept with my wife in another room, which
happened to be the one in which my mother-in-law had died. Once more
I felt the touch of a cold hand and I looked up expecting to see the appari-
tion, but there was nothing. I lit a candle and smoked a cigarette, exactly
as before, but nothing happened. I fold my wife about it next morning.
The first experience I had found upsetting, but the second time I was
affected much more slightly."
In the M'Connel case, which we have used as a typical example of a
crisis apparition, Lieut Larkin's vision of his brother airman may well
have been the result of a state of expectancy or anxiety. Larkin knew that
his friend had gone out on a flight. He must have known that the weather
175] The Investigation of spontaneous Cases 287
conditions were bad. There is no definite statement in either the printed
account or the original documents of the case as to whether Larkin knew
also that the companion plane had made a forced landing.
If some other pilot back from a trip had looked into the room, made a
casual remark and gone out again, Larkin would not normally have mis-
taken him for M'Connel. But the circumstances were unusual. He may
have been anxious (perhaps subconsciously) and on the look-out for
M'Connel, in which case it would require a very slight hallucination
indeed to convert the momentarily perceived voice and features of another
man into those of the friend whose appearance was so much desired.
VI. Chance Coincidence
Most psychic apparitions convey only one piece of information, namely
that a particular person has just died. The scope for chance coincidence
in these cases is more easily assessed than in dreams, which tend to cover
a multiplicity of topics. Here the issue is quite clear. Does the corres-
pondence between apparitions and the deaths of their real life counterparts
happen more often than one would expect by chance coincidence?
At first sight the question seems futile. One cannot conceive that cases
like that of Lieutenant M'Connel, seen at the very moment he was killed,
could be due to chance coincidence. To explain things away by invoking
chance is such a facile method of escaping a logical impasse that the out-
come does not carry conviction.
It is to the credit of the early investigators, that although the chance
coincidence hypothesis must have seemed to them an absurdity, they
realised the need for a scientific answer to the question. They saw that
the argument depended upon the relative frequencies of coincidental and
non-coincidental hallucinations, so, in the true spirit of scientific investiga-
tion, they set out to determine these frequencies by means of a census of
hallucinations.
Collectors were sent out to obtain answers to the following question :
Have you ever, when believing yourself to be completely awake, had a
vivid impression of seeing or being touched by a living being or inanimate
object, or of hearing a voice ; which impression, so far as you could dis-
cover, was not due to any external physical cause?
Of the 17,000 answers received, 2,272 were in the affirmative, that is to
say thirteen per cent of the people questioned admitted to having had a
hallucination not accounted for by illness or intoxication.
Before any inferences are drawn one must be sure that this figure for
the total number of hallucinations is not an under-estimate, otherwise the
death coincidences will seem to form a spuriously large proportion of the
cases.
Untruthfulness might account for some degree of under-estimation.
The census question asked only for a plain " yes " or " no " in the first
instance. A practical joker might say " yes " where he should say " no ",
but this would lead to an over-estimate, which is an error on the conserva-
tive side. Against this, some people might be too cautious to admit
having had hallucinations. These people would probably refuse to
answer and so lessen the affirmative replies. This eflPect was actually
present, but it was counterbalanced by an error in the opposite direction,
288 D.J. West [Part
due to collectors tending to select for questioning persons most likely to
give positive answers.^
One source of error with which the census does not seem to deal very
adequately, is the complication of multiple hallucinations. In the first
instance, the census counted the number of percipients, but 381 percipi-
ents had experienced more than one hallucination. There was no difficulty
when the hallucinations were specified and enumerated, but 28 percipients
had experienced more than one hallucination who could not say exactly
how many hallucinations they had had. The experiences of these
percipients, whether veridical or no, were ignored. Actually, seven death
coincidences were excluded by this rule.
It is not clear that this method gives a good picture of the situation.
It might have been better to exclude all hallucinations and all death co-
incidences that were not unique in the percipients' experience. The
problem is further complicated by the very real danger that percipients
who have had more than one hallucination will be reluctant to admit them,
for fear of being suspected of mental peculiarity.
The gross error introduced by the tendency to forget non-veridical
hallucinations has already been described, and so has the unsatisfactory
method whereby the efi^ect was allowed for in the census.
When the adjustment had been made, the number of recognised, human
apparitions in the collection, corrected for forgetfulness by multiplying by
four, amounted to i ,300. Against this there were 65 recorded cases in which
the apparition occurred within 1 2 hours (either side) of the death of its agent.
The estimated number of death coincidences had now to undergo
certain corrections. An arbitrary deduction of 22 was made to allow for
possible apocryphal cases, because, as already explained, there was an
excess of remote cases. A correction was made for the tendency of collec-
tors to seek especially for coincidental cases. A good proportion of cases
were stated definitely not to have been known beforehand by the collector.
For the rest, a generous deduction of 11 cases was made. Two further
cases were deducted because the apparitions were seen out of doors or in a
bad light and might have been illusions. Altogether the 65 reported
death coincidences were reduced by over fifty per cent.
The final corrected result was 30 death coincidences out of 1,300
recognised apparitions. That is to say, one in every 43 apparitions co-
incided, within 24 hours, with its agent's death.
The census investigators considered this result highly significant. They
pointed out that the national death statistics showed that only one person
in 19,000 dies in any given 24 hour span. This means that on an average,
if only chance is at work, only one apparition in 19,000 should be a death
coincidence. After generous allowance had been made for all possible
sources of error, the census had yielded an actual proportion of one death
coincidence in every 43 apparitions.
^ In order to obtain some figures free from both these sources of error, the
census investigators questioned random samples of the general population, such
as were provided by dinner parties and other social gatherings. Samples in which
any refusals were encountered were rejected. By this means, 626 replies were
obtained, thirteen per cent of them being in the affirmative. This result shows
that the combined effect of the two sources of error mentioned was not very great
and may be safely neglected.
175] The Investigation of Spontaiwoiis Cases 289
While these figures are certainly suggestive, they are not by any means
a statistical refutation of the chance coincidence hypothesis. Individuals
are extremely variable with respect to the likelihood of death within 24
hours, so variable indeed that an average figure for the whole population
is useless when applied to such a small statistical sample as the census of
hallucinations. The proper procedure would have been to examine each
case on its merits and make an estimate of the probability of each agent's
death from such date as age and state of health.
Another criticism, far more serious than the statistical shortcomings,
cuts across one of the basic assumptions upon which the census argument
rests. In order that the result shall mean anything at all, all the death
coincidences included in the account must be genuine.
In assessing the probability of the genuineness of a death coincidence,
such factors as have already been dealt with, namely hoaxing, deceptive
memory, mistaken identity or suggestion, must all be taken into account.
Before a case is accepted as genuine it is right to expect some independent
evidence that the coincidence was as close as the narrator's memory would
have one believe. There should be an assurance that the percipient had
no reason to expect the agent's death, as well as some testimony on the
vital point that the hallucinatory experience came before the news of the
death.
The census report includes accounts of 26 cases which were considered
evidentially satisfactory, and if these 26 cases only had been counted, and
proportionate reductions made for the effects already discussed, the result
would still have been highly suggestive. Unfortunately, even the 26
printed cases fail to conform to our present conception of elementary rules
of evidence. In only six of the cases was there a claim that a written note
had been made before news of the death arrived. Of these six cases,
there was only one in which the note had been preserved. Even then it
was not satisfactory, as the lady who had made the note in her diary was
too shy to put it in words. Instead she used symbols, the exact meaning
of which she afterwards forgot. Of the other five cases in this group, one
stands on the percipient's unsubstantiated word and in another the only
confirmation comes from a deceased witness's daughter. In a third case,
the hallucination might well have been due to expectancy, for it is recorded
that the agent, who was about to undergo a confinement, had told the
percipient she v/as expecting to die. Indeed, the expectancy objection
could be applied to five out of six cases, for in only one of them is there
any statement to the effect that the percipient was not expecting the
agent's death. Space will not permit an analysis of all 26 cases, but one
or other of these general objections applies to nearly every one. The
census claim to 26 evidential death coincidences is thus misleading. There
might be an odd case fairly well substantiated, but that could be just a
chance coincidence.
The census result, far from being the last word on the subject, must be
regarded as inconclusive. In arguing against chance coincidence, the
census investigators, like their followers in later generations, forget that
they have to refute all other normal explanations as well. It is no use
dealing with chance in isolation from all the other normal factors which
combine to produce the phenomenon of the psychic apparition. If all the
290 D. J. West [Part
recorded cases had to be accepted, the chance coincidence hypothesis
would be untenable, but when deductions and allowances are made for all
the normal explanations that have been discussed, then it becomes feasible.
No single normal explanation will ever be found to fit the enormous
variety of reported phenomena.
If the very elaborate census investigation did not succeed in disproving
the chance coincidence hypothesis, the question is what type of evidence
would be conclusive. The great flaw in the census was that the final data'
upon which the statistics were based had not been reduced to a clear-cut
issue between chance and telepathy. It is no use proving statistical
significance unless one can be sure that the result is due to psychic faculty
and not to faulty reporting.
In the case of premonitions, it has always been recognised that the
sovereign remedy from an evidential point of view is to collect the impres-
sion before the verification. Precisely the same principle applies to
apparitional cases. If the people who see an apparition would only inform
the Society at once, instead of waiting for some sort of confirmation
and then reporting the experience, we would have a much more useful
set of data for evaluation. It would still have to be established that the
percipient had no normal knowledge of the information conveyed by the
apparition, but otherwise cases reported at such an early stage, and
verified later, would be proof against all the objections that have been
mentioned.
Perhaps this is an unreachable ideal, but if the same amount of energy
were devoted to its attainment as was expended upon the census we might
get somewhere. If six hundred members of the Society were made
thoroughly conversant with the need for reporting apparitions immediately,
one would expect a few examples in the course of the next year or so. If
the same appeal were addressed to a larger audience, by those who write
articles and give lectures, the result would be obtained sooner. The great
advantage of such an investigation would be that the result would be either
positive or negative and not indecisive, as most investigations in this field
have been up to date.
VI. Quality of the Cases
In the literature of our subject there are constant references to the high
quality of the cases published by the S.P.R. They are admired for the
amount of corroborative evidence which accompanies them, as well as for
their highly veridical content.
The present writer has read through large numbers of cases in Proceedings
and Journal, and it seems to him that in both respects their quality is
over-rated. In the light of all the possible objections, and the obvious
flaws in testimony of this kind, most of the cases seem worse than mediocre.
The best known cases, that are supposed to be the cream of the evidence
for telepathy, seem dubious on close inspection. The case of Robert
Mackenzie, (26) for instance, is often quoted roughly as follows :
Robert Mackenzie presented himself to his employer in a dream and
said that he was not guilty of what people thought. It was learned later
that the experience coincided with Mackenzie's accidental death by
swallowing nitric acid. The first tidings, afterwards corrected, were that
1 The Invcstigutiov of SpoiiUineous Cases 29
1
it was a deliberate suicide. What is more, the peculiar facial appearance
of the apparition corresponded to the symptoms of nitric acid poisoning.
This account is superficially impressive, but becomes disappointing on
critical examination. In the first place the experience was a dream, and
one has to take into account the vast number of unreported non-veridical
dreams.i
On receipt of the news of the suicide, the percipient told his wife that
he did not think Mackenzie had done it on purpose. This slender point
is the only part of his testimony that can be checked, yet the case is
frequently quoted as evidential.
Phantasms so often wear a deathly look that there is not much of a
coincidence in the similarity between the dying man's countenance and
the face seen in the dream. Lastly, the coincidence in time was not very
close : the dream took place two days after the accident.
This example would not have been worth quoting were it not typical of
the published cases, nearly every one of which have serious imperfections.
The fact is that good cases are far rarer than most psychical researches are
willing to admit.
Miss Hilda Harding, a member of the Society, has been kind enough to
read through numerous cases in the S.P.R. Journal for the purpose of
studying the lines of evidence which they contain. Miss Harding is
particularly well qualified for this task, combining the advantages of the
trained legal mind of the barrister with the sympathetic understanding of
one who has had psychic dreams and impressions herself. She writes as
follows :
" Notes on Evidence offered for '
Cases '
quoted
IN Journal of S.P.R."
" At the suggestion of the Research Officer, I arranged to go through
the '
Cases '
quoted in the Journal of the Society starting at the year 1884
and going on to the current issue with the object of trying to evaluate the
evidence given in support of these cases (Spontaneous Impressions,
Hallucinations, Dreams). Having done fifteen volumes which form a
representative cross-section I have abandoned the task for the evidence
seems to me to have little value for the unbiassed examiner, hardly any-
thing emerging which could be called first-class. I was greatly struck by
the tendency of the cases to take the form provided by the '
thought-
pattern '
of the period—for example, the early cases are far more naif
lit makes a lot of difference whether an apparitional experience is a true
hallucination or a dream. The former, being a much rarer occurrence, affords
better evidence against chance correspondence. The case of Lieutenant M'Connel,
which has been used as a standard example of a crisis apparition, could have been
a dream. In reporting the case, Lieutenant M'Connel's father pointed out that
Larkin might have been dreaming, but this part of his letter did not appear in the
published account. It reads as follows :
" In his {i.e. Lieutenant Larkin's) written account he says that he was sitting in
an easy chair before the fire in the room. ... I had particularly drawn Larkin's
attention to the possibility of his being asleep at the time. . . . Sitting before a
fire in any chair is conducive to sleep on occasion. But even if he had dreamed
that he saw my son, it could have been sufficiently extraordinary occurring at
that hour."
292 D.J. West [Part
than those of later volumes by which time modern psychological ideas,
particularly with regard to telepathy, have percolated widely through
many strata of the population.
" From the nature of the circumstances governing the Cases real copper-
bottomed evidence is almost impossible to come by. Ideally each
percipient should be examined and cross-examined by competent persons
immediately after an incident has taken place and before repeated narra-
tions of the experience has resulted in accretions of details which so overlay
the original. Such evidence as is offered in attempted corroboration
—
statements by relatives and friends, postmarked letters in which the
experience is described—is often worth nothing. It merely proves that
the percipient purported to have such and such a supernatural experience
on a given date. Nothing is proved of the bona fide of the principal party.
Against the mere word of the percipient we are obliged to offset all that
life has taught us of the strange results ensuing from lack of mental
balance, honest error, illusion, expectancy, suggestion and so forth, apart
altogether from mischievous lying.
" In some of the cases investigators sought out the percipients and
questioned them, but the investigations do not sound sufficiently searching.
A dispassionate unbiassed attitude is essential for this work and much
skill and practice is required.
H. H."
VII. Insanity
The title of this section is perhaps a little mysterious. Unless one has
had personal contact with people claiming psychic experiences, it may be
difficult to imagine what insanity has to do with the subject. Of course
there are individuals, completely bereft of psychic sense, but with a
robust common-sense, who assume that if a person believes he has had a
psychic experience he must be out of his mind. Most psychical researchers
think they can afford to look down upon such ignorant scoffers. But it is
dangerous to ignore the voice of common-sense. In this connection,
as in many another, there is a germ of truth in what the voice has to say.
Visionary experiences inspired by telepathy are often claimed without
foundation by persons suffering from mental disease. All psychiatrists
seem agreed on that point, irrespective of whether they believe in the
occurrence of genuine telepathy. There are actually thousands of patients
in (and out of) asylums, the main feature of whose illness is an obsession
by imaginary psychic entities.
We have to try and decide how far, if at all, the spontaneous cases of
psychic experiences studied by the S.P.R. may be delusions. Delusions
are common in most mental illness, but paranoria (delusional insanity
proper) is responsible for most of the well-developed, systematised, psychic
obsessions. It is by no means unknown for S.P.R. officials to have to deal
with wild-eyed callers, who claim to be in constant telepathic rapport with
something or somebody. Unsatisfactory persons, who haven't been able
to hold their own in life, they have found refuge in delusions. Existence
is only possible for them if they can convince themselves that they are
above the common level, possessed of unique powers. The delusion may
be based upon faulty reasoning, false premises or even hallucinatory
The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 293
experiences ; but whatever the mechanism no amount of reasoning or
demonstration will shake their faith. These are the paranoics. Although
common, they are fairly easily recognised, and their friends or relatives
are usually only too well aware of their peculiarities. It is, therefore,
doubtful if any of the published corroborated cases are paranoic experi-
ences, althougla there is no doubt they occur frequently in the large number
of uncorroborated unpublished cases.
Other forms of insanity give rise to psychic delusions, particularly
schizophrenia of the paramoid variety. In this disease, there is a woolli-
ness of thought, and the patient loves to direct his attention to psychologi-
cal and psychic subjects, in which he can express vague speculations in
high-sounding jargon. Auditory hallucinations are common and may be
attributed to psychic forces. Once again, if the case be properly investi-
gated it should never reach the S.P.R. publications. However, the present
writer must confess that he is aware of one case, probably explicable by
delusion, in which the contributor died as a certified patient in an
institution shortly after an account of his " experiences " appeared in the
S.P.R. Journal.^
These flagrant varieties of delusion are of less significance for our
present discussion than the subtle effects which take place in approximately
normal minds. False beliefs, which rational argument cannot affect, are
not the monopoly of the certifiably insane. This seeking refuge in
delusion is a common enough phenomenon in the so-called normal
person. The religious convictions of primitive tribes or unorthodox sects
clearly enter the category of delusions. For many, the brutal truths of
life could not be faced without such an opiate, and when one is already
provided by the customs and traditions of the environment, the average
mind cannot resist it.
The exact nature of the opiate does not seem to matter, so long as it
increases one's importance in the scheme of things. Some people find a
belief in psychic phenomena an excellent opiate. It does away with
materialism and removes the unpleasant consequences associated with
that theory.
In other words, whenjudging the reliability of an account of a psychic ex-
perience one must try to find out whether the story is just a wish-fulfilment.
If the narrator has a deep-seated yearning for the supernatural, that may be
sufficient to cause the strange exaggeration and lapses of memorj^ which
have already been discussed {e.g. the case of " Sir Edmund Hornby ").
The person who is sensitive to telepathic impressions is often just the
sort to have these queer psychological mechanisms in a well-marked form.
As one lady remarked to the writer : "I have known people who have
these experiences regularly, some of which I feel sure are genuine, but I
have noticed that their descriptions are very unreliable, and they hardly
know themselves when they are speaking the truth." It has always been
maintained that the psychically sensitive have a tendency to mental dis-
sociation. Dr Ehrenwald has just written a book which takes things
further, and claims that the psychic gift is associated with definite schizoid
tendencies. These considerations make it imperative to have all cases
well corroborated.
The evidence for this statement is on record in the Society's private files.
294 D.J. West [Part
VIII. Conformity to Type
Common features appear in accounts of apparitions that are widely
separated in time and place. It is often argued that this conformity to
type is good evidence of genuineness.
The assumption is that common characteristics are a guarantee of
authenticity, but although this sounds reasonable, it is not strictly true.
Ghost stories of fiction are by and large true to type, but they are not
authentic on that account. The fashion is set by popular ideas on the
subject, to which the stories naturally conform. Similarly, it may be that
real life apparitional cases are equally coloured by current opinions of
what a ghost should be like. It is highly significant that since the tele-
pathic theory has been in vogue, sensational and purposeful ghosts are
reported less frequently (27) and that dreams and mental impressions have
largely taken the place of life-like apparitions. These changes are in
keeping with the new idea of subjective telepathic impressions as opposed
to the old idea of spirit visitations.
It has been remarked how the best evidenced cases differ from fictitious
stories in that the apparition is usually more ethereal, and never leaves
behind footmarks, or other physical traces. This is, of course, good evi-
dence for subjectivity ; it suggests that apparitions are hallucinations
generated in the mind of the percipient, but it has no bearing on the
question of supernormality. However, the fact that ghosts are hallucina-
tory explains how they can reflect the notions of the percipients, and change
their character with the progress of ideas.
Apart from the overall resemblance, due to subjectivity and other
common factors, ghost stories are readily classified into sub-groups,
within which the similarities are closer and more detailed. The crisis
apparition and the haunt are examples of well-recognised types into
which cases fall with almost monotonous regularity. This conformity to
type is often instanced as particularly good evidence for the supernormal.
Of course it is nothing of the sort.
Accounts of witchcraft and black magic are true to type, but we are not
forced to accept them on that score. The ill-reputed poltergeist is about
the most true to type among ghosts, but he is the type most mistrusted by
psychical researchers. Noisy ghosts, addicted to stone-throwing and like
pursuits, have been reported from all quarters of the globe, and the
similarity between some of the classical cases is uncanny. For example, the
1935 talking mongoose (28) has its counterparts in the little animals seen in
the Epworth Haunting (29) of 1791 and the Willington Mill manifestations
(30) of 1835-1847. The mongoose christened itself Jeff, whilst both
the Willington Mill and the Epworth ghosts were familiarly referred
to as Old Jeffrey. The mongoose, the Willington Ghost and the Ring-
croft Ghost (31) of 1695 were all described as making chuck-chucking
noises, whilst Old Jeffrey of Epworth was reported to have gobbled like a
turkey-cock.
This strange tradition of the poltergeist, handed down through the ages,
baffles many observers, but it is really no more wonderful than the persis-
tence of folk-lore. Certainly it is no evidence for telepathy.
If apparitions are not psychic they are presumably morbid, that is
dependent, like other hallucinations, on some temporary derangement of
lys] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 295
mind or body. However, the average apparition is certainly different in
character from the hallucination fever or insanity.
Dr Head, the well-known physiologist, investigated (32) some hallucina-
tions occurring in sane, non-delirious hospital patients who were suffering
from visceral disease. He found that the hallucinations were usually of
unrealistic human figures. The face was generally indefinite, the limbs
absent, and the form draped rather than clothed. As a rule there were no
accompanying sounds and the figures were never articulate.
In a paper in Proceedings (33) Mr Piddington contrasts these character-
istics with a typical psychic apparition, which is vivid, lifelike, normally
clothed, and with clearly recognisable features. Its movements are ac-
companied by appropriate rustlings, it often says a few words, and it very
rarely appears more than once.
This contrast is of interest, although it cannot be said to provide evidence
of a different origin and still less of a psychic origin. The cases reported
to the S.P.R. are not a random sample of all hallucinations. A lifelike
apparition would be much more likely to be reported to a psychic society
than a hallucination of smell, for example. It would be grossly unfair,
therefore, to claim this characteristic as a special property of psychic cases.
Then again, Dr Head's investigation was confined to certain types of
patient. If he had concentrated on a group of people in whom belief in
ghosts and telepathy was strong, he might have collected more cases of
the S.P.R. variety.
IX. Collective Percipiency
One cannot discuss spontaneous cases fairly without some mention of
collectively perceived apparitions. Usually there is no recognisable
correspondence with outside events. The apparition does not coincide
with death, it is just an unexplained figure seen by two or more people
when they are together in the same room.
If, independently, two people have at the same moment similar hallucina-
tory experiences it is a not unreasonable hypothesis that their minds are
in telepathic rapport. But the contention rests upon the word " indepen-
dent ".
Consider the theory that the Indian rope trick is due to mass suggestion.
Incidents have repeatedly been described (34) in which an onlooker a little
way off, out of sight of the magician's suggestions, sees only a crowd of
people staring at the sky, whereas people in the immediate vicinity can all
see a boy climbing a rope and disappearing. A photograph taken at the
same moment proves that the explanation is collective hallucination.
These stories have never been sufficiently authenticated, but they illustrate
the principle of a mechanism whereby more than one person may share
the same hallucination without the intervention of telepathy.
The rope trick story is credible in view of the acknowledged occurrence
of collective religious hallucinations, such as the case in which several
people could all see a cross in the sky. Similar in principle, and well
authenticated, are the collective hallucinations which sometimes occur at
seances. In a recent book (35) Dr Dingwall mentions one such case which
he personally investigated.
296 D.y. West [Part
A medium and circle in Massachusetts believed that they were seeing
materialised forms, spirit dogs would nestle in their laps, and heavenly-
music would fill the seance room. Dr Dingwall went there and found
that hardly anything actually happened, the marvels described were
imaginary phenomena built up round the medium by a process of suggestion
and hallucination on the grand scale.
Another case was described at length by Professor Harlow Gale (36). Dr
E. S. led a small circle of enthusiasts who shared with him regularly
hallucinatory visions of Christ and other figures. The people seemed
perfectly genuine, really believing that they saw these things, although to
an outsider there was nothing there.
In these cases of collective hallucination in the seance room diff'erent
people see the same things, not because of telepathy, but because they are
motivated by the same desire and expectancy. Doubtless in fraudulent
cases the dimly-perceived figure of a masquerading medium forms an
ideal starting point for a collective hallucination.
The genesis of spontaneous collective hallucinations which occur in the
absence of obvious suggestive influences is something of a mystery. We
do not know why people are susceptible to them only on rare occasions.
When such hallucinations do occur it is reasonable to suppose that they
have some sensory starting point or point de repere. For example, the
slight opening of a door might be the precipitating factor in a hallucinatory
fantasy of someone coming into the room. If there were two people
present who were at that moment in a state susceptible to hallucinations
they might both " see " a figure entering.
This would not account for cases in which figures seen by different
people are afterwards found to tally in detailed appearance. Although
this claim is often made, it is very rarely substantiated with accounts
written independently by the percipients without previous consultation.
Granting that such cases occur, there are several possible explanations
that do not involve telepathy.
We know from the phenomena of trance and dissociation in general that
once a hallucinatory fantasy is begun it will tend to continue by making
use of whatever suggestions or information is given to the percipient.
That is why a perfectly honest medium can be led into any sort of absurdity
if the sitter drops the appropriate hints. For this reason also the content
of a hallucination may be somewhat infectious. The fixed gaze, the facial
expression and the exclamations of the first percipient may provide hints
which influence the content of the second percipient's hallucination.
I have been asked by one of my critics to try to apply some of these
normal hypotheses to what is regarded as a good case of collective
hallucination which occurred at Boscastle in 1933 (37). A man and wife
were travelling by bus in Cornwall and looking out for a suitable guest
house at which to stay. Presently the gentleman noticed a house with a
garden containing some cane chairs and tables shielded by black and
orange umbrellas. He pointed this out to his wife, who saw it also. When
they got off the bus, she walked back to look for the house, but it was
gone. They both made a thorough but unavailing search, and eventually
concluded that they must have been the subjects of a collective
hallucination.
175] The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 297
Evidentially the case is poor. It is just conceivable that tlie house seen
from the bus might have been a real one which they could not find again
either because it was too well screened by trees or hedges or because they
had mistaken the locality. The percipients did not write down indepen-
dent records of what they saw. In the Journal nine years after the event
they say they both saw the same house (although a detailed description is
not given by both parties) and that they both noticed the garden umbrellas.
They must have discussed the mystery many times in the interim and it
may be that the apparent similarity of their experiences is the spurious
result of the gradual fusion of their two visions. We have already noted
tricks of memory far more extreme than this in connection with supposedly
psychic occurrences.
Supposing for the sake of discussion that the account accurately repre-
sents what actually happened, is there no other explanation than telepathy?
The Editor of Journal, in his comments on the case, pointed out that the
hallucination appeared to depend for its motive upon wish-fulfilment.
The wish of the percipients for a suitable guest house may have set their
imaginations working in unison upon the construction and exteriorisation
of a detailed picture of such a house.
Granting this, we still need to advance some theory to account for the
striking similarity of the two exteriorisations in the detail of the garden um-
brellas. Dr Morton Prince in his experimental studies of hallucinations (38)
has shown that they are sometimes pictorial representations of subconscious
thoughts about incidents forgotten by the conscious personality. Suppose
that the percipients in this case, man and wife, had in the past pleasant
associations with a particular guest house with umbrellas in the garden,
that would be sufficient to account for this detail appearing in both their
visions.
Thus, given the unknown conditions necessary for a hallucination to
occur at all, the common wish to find a guest house would explain why
they both " saw " a house. The fact that they were both looking in the
same direction at the same scene with the same points de repere would
account for the general similarity of their imaginary houses. Their
common background of experience and associations would explain the
appearance of similar details in their visions.
After having written as above, I was interested to discover that as long
ago as 1894 Edmund Parish had advanced precisely the same theory to
account for cases of this kind (39).
Of course this is all speculative. At this distance in time one cannot
prove that this is the correct explanation of the case in question. However,
so long as the sceptic can show that any sort of normal explanation is
feasible, the case cannot be held to prove telepathy. Where there are two
alternatives, normal and supernormal, it is logical to choose the former
until it can be positively disproved. Here we are not actually forced to
choose either alternative. The evidence as yet is not enough to establish
that people do really experience independently identical hallucinations.
If such cases occur at all, they are sufficiently rare to warrant postulating
unusual applications of known tendencies in preference to an utterly new
" psychic " principle.
A collective hallucination would be much better evidence for the super-
298 D.J. West [Part
normal if it were verdical, e.g. an apparition coinciding with death. If
collective hallucinations have a telepathic basis one would expect some such
cases among them, but there are very few recorded instances. A paper
in Proceedings by H. and E. B. Hart (40) contains the results of an ex-
haustive search through the literature for cases of collective percipiency.
They did not succeed in finding a single first-class crisis case. They could
only discover one second-class and a few that were described as of third-
class evidential standard.
Various third-class cases were described by the Harts in their paper,
but as they were mainly uncorroborated reminiscences of events in the
distant past it is not worth discussing them here. I have been able to
find only one veridical collective case of any value, (41) This was not
included in the Harts' paper because it concerns a hallucinatory voice and
not a visual impression.
Two young ladies, Margaret and Constance, out of doors together, both
heard a voice calling their names. At the same time (12 noon) Constance's
brother, who was lying very ill at home, sat up and called out " Margaret,
Constance ". The case is well substantiated, but the accounts were iiot
written up until over three years later. There are slight discrepancies
between the different versions. Margaret's brother, a friend of Mr Pod-
more, could remember nothing of the incident. The girls did not recognise
the voice or connect it with the sick relative, in fact they seemed to
consider it likely that it was a friend playing a prank. The case is certainly
suggestive, but standing alone it cannot be regarded as good evidence.
X. Experimentally Induced Hallucinations .
The most direct evidence for the telepathic explanation of apparitions
comes from the semi-experimental case, in which an agent, by concen-
trating his thoughts, makes his apparition appear to a chosen percipient.
This would be as neat a proof as any, but again the evidence for such
cases is slender.
S.P.R. literature contains only about half a dozen cases, not one of
which is less than fifty years old. Numerous attempts have been made to
induce apparitions by mental concentration, especially since the etheric
double became popular, but failure has been the rule.^ It is certainly not
a repeatable experiment.
Even the few recorded cases are not at all convincing. Typical is the ex-
ample in the Census Report (42) in which Mr Kirk makes himself appear to
Miss G. The narrative reveals that Miss G. knew that Mr Kirk had for
some time been trying to make her see his double. On several occasions
he had got so far as to induce in her a state of restlessness, so that when
the fully-fledged apparition arrived it was not exactly a bolt from the blue.
This example is an illustration of how inner details of a case can reveal
unsuspected possibilities for normal explanation. It suggests that many
more cases would be explicable if only the necessary details had been
included in the accounts.
iQne such unsuccessful experiment was conducted by Mr Denys Parsons in
1046 A group of S.P.R. members all concentrated their thoughts upon the
President of the Society, trying to make him see a bulldog, but without afTecting
him in any way.
175] J^he Investigation of Spontaneous Cases 299
CONCLUSION
It has been the aim of this paper to give some account of the technical
difficuhies involved in the investigation of spontaneous psychic cases, to
show how much has to be done before the paranormal explanation can be
said to be scientifically proved. Opinions will diff^er as to how near the
evidence already collected is to positive proof, but it would be difficult to
deny the need for more evidence while the majority of scientists remain
unconvinced.
Some of the normal explanations put forward in this paper have been
complicated or implausible. On the other hand the cases they are intended
to explain are themselves very exceptional. For every comparitively good
case which comes to be published by the Society, there are a hundred cases
of vague coincidences or distant recollections which can be disposed of
by the plainest common-sense. The few exceptional examples do strongly
suggest a psychic explanation. The problem is whether they are due to
an unusual extension of the normal factors so well-known in the poorer
types of case, or whether they are really supernormal. The pioneers who
collected the cases and discovered the problem have handed it on to us,
whose duty it is to find a solution that will stand for all time.
Various suggestions have been made in the course of this paper as to
what would constitute evidence more conclusive than that already
obtained. More good modern cases are needed ; cases in which the facts
given could not have been guessed or inferred by any stretch of the
imagination of the percipient ; cases in which written note was made and
witnessed at the time the impression was received ; cases in which the
circumstances preclude fraud ; cases which are not just one lucky hit
among many that never came true.
Everything depends upon the people who have psychic impressions
recording them at once and sending them in to the Society without
waiting for confirmation. In other words, if further progress is to be
made, it is for those who have these psychic gifts and experiences to take
action, as well as the investigators. This fundamental truth should be
given the widest possible advertisement.

A COMMENTARY ON
" THE INVESTIGATION OF SPONTANEOUS CASES " -.
By W. H. Salter
No worse fate could be imagined for a Society, born, as our own was, in a
blaze of unorthodoxy, than that it should decline into a dull traditionalism
and assumption of inerrancy. Those who are engaged in extending any
department of knowledge should from time to time examine their founda-
tions, and the return to normal activities after the dislocation of the war is
perhaps a convenient occasion for us to examine ours.
Dr West in the foregoing paper has submitted to examination the
spontaneous mental phenomena which were the material for the first
large-scale enquiry undertaken by the S.P.R., and which have during
most of its career engaged a large part of its activities. He brings to the
work the indispensable qualities of a fresh mind and immense diligence.
Spontaneous cases are scattered all over our Proceedings and Journal, but
the larger part of them are to be found collected in the book. Phantasms
of the Living (1886) and in two volumes of Proceedings, Vol. X (1894)
which contains the report on the Census of Hallucinations, and Vol.
XXXIII (1923) in which Mrs Sidgwick analysed a large number of cases
printed in the Journal but not previously published. As one who was
already an Hon. Officer of the Society when Vol. XXXIII appeared, and
one of the regrettably few present members of the Society who were
brought into close touch with both Mrs Sidgwick and Miss Johnson, the
principal authors of the report on the Census, I can perhaps help some
readers of Proceedings to place themselves at the historical angle from
which they can best judge how much value the main S.P.R. literature on
spontaneous cases still retains for the student.
The authors of Phantasms were Edmund Gurney, Frederic Myers and
Frank Podmore. Gurney died in 1888, before the Census Committee
began its work. The members of the Census Committee were Henry
Sidgwick, Mrs Sidgwick, Frederic Myers> his brother Arthur Myers (who
died before the report was completed), Alice Johnson and Frank Podmore.
It would be superfluous to dwell on the intellectual abilities of each and
all of the men and women named above, but the quite exceptional
impression made on their contemporaries by the mind and character of
Henry Sidgwick and Mrs Sidgwick should not be forgotten.
Most of the seven had considerable previous experience of this class of
investigation. Sidgwick, Frederic Myers and Gurney had been associated
in it since 1874, and to some extent before that. From her marriage in
1876 onwards Mrs Sidgwick was in the closest touch with their work.
Podmore had been a member of the Oxford Phasmatological Society
founded in 1879. That they were alive to the principal weaknesses
inherent in reports of unusual occurrences is apparent from the whole
tenor of Phantasms, and especially from Chapter IV, " General Criticism
of the Evidence for Spontaneous Telepathy " (Vol. I, pp. 1 14-172).
But bias, where present, may defeat ability and experience, and it is
301
302 W. H. Salter [Part 1!
proper to consider how far the judgment of any of them was a biassed one.
Podmore was in his early days a Spiritualist, and Myers all though his life i
hoped to find evidence proving survival. If bias is to be imputed to
either, it should be recognised that there was a conflict of possible biasses,
one operating in favour of accepting as genuine narratives which appeared
inconsistent with general materialist principles, and another against
accepting narratives which strengthened the position for telepathy as a
possible alternative explanation for a great deal of the evidence that might
otherwise count as survivalistic. I do not detect much sign of either bias
in Phantasms or the Census report. The other members of the group \
did not, I think, start their enquiries with any bias in favour of the super-
normal. Mrs Sidgwick and Alice Johnson indeed enjoyed an almost epic
fame for persistent incredulity, as Podmore was already, in the middle
nineties, beginning to do. In his Telepathic Hallucinations : The New
View of Ghosts, published in 1909, Podmore re-affirms the position he had
taken up many years before in Phantasms and the Census report.
I see no reason to suppose that any of the authors of Phantasms or of
the Census Committee had any personal kink in judging evidence, but if
:
he or she had, it must have been straightened out by the collective
judgment of the group. As for the cases printed in the Journal between
the Census report and 1923, when Vol. XXXIII of Proceedings was pub- j
lished, these were submitted to fresh examination by Mrs Sidgwick, and
very critical examination as her comments show. Since that time most
cases printed in the Journal have been critically discussed by two or three I
persons of experience before printing. The fact that so little reliance has |
been placed on the judgment of a single person puts the cases printed in ;
our Proceedings and Journal on a quite different footing from any that can I
be claimed for even the best collections of cases printed elsewhere.
The early investigators took immense pains to establish personal
contact with percipients and witnesses. As Myers, in his Obituary of
Gurney (Proc, V, p. 372), remarks :
" Almost every living witness of importance in Phantasms of the Living
(and many whose names do not occur in that book) had, before the book I
was published, been personally visited by one of ourselves."

The whole of this page and of pages 160 and 161 of Phantasms, Vol. I, 1

should be studied. The following extract from Sidgwick's Journal for if
1885 is also instructive :
"Sept. 19. Psychical Research is not disagreeable when the subjects of i
enquiry live in well-situated country houses and ask one to lunch : one i
feels, in fact, that one is making the best of both worlds. But when (as 1
on Wednesday) one travels from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. in abnormal heat on
the day of the fair of the neighbourhood . . . the case is altered, and one I
has to remind oneself of the sacrifices made by other scientific investigators j
in the cause of truth. However, the results are on the whole satisfactory : 1
the stories that become worse after oral examination are mostly those that |
we had already judged to be objectionable, and some are decidedly |
improved by the examination." i
(Henry Sidgwick : A Memoir, p. 388.) t
It is regretfully to be admitted that of recent years less has been done
175] A Commentary on " The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases "
303
in the way of " oral examination ", owing to difficulties of travel during
and after the war, the shortage of investigators able to give the time, and
possibly the lack of invitations to lunch in well-situated country houses.
In many spheres of human activity it is assumed that facts put forward
as genuine after critical examination by competent, diligent and un-
prejudiced persons may safely be accepted by other people as the basis of
serious decisions ;
law, business, private and public affairs are run on that
principle. If it were not found to work, the historian's task would be
hopeless. Does every scientist repeat over again for himself all the
experiments and observations on which his studies are based?
We should therefore, I think, accept the accounts of spontaneous occur-
rences printed in Phantasms, the Census report and Vol. XXXIII of
Proceedings as in the main reliable statements of fact. Even the ablest
men and women are not infallible, and as a matter of prudence some
allowance should be made for this when considering the theoretical
implications of individual cases, especially such as do not run true to
type. This matter of type is important. It was a striking feature of
Phantasms that the cases which stood up well to examination possessed
certain characteristics which differentiated them from the popular tradition
displayed in fictional ghost-stories, and exemplified in some narratives
purporting to be authentic, but breaking down when examined. Gurney
seems to me to have been fully justified in claiming this as strongly
supporting the credibility of the cases he quoted (see Phantasms I, pp.
165, 166).
But in applying conformity to type in support of credibility, it must be
remembered that there was a considerable lapse of time between Phantasms
(1886) and Vol. XXXIII of Proceedings (1923). Phantasms was a pioneer
work : many of the cases the authors had before them were already old, and
although their argument is based on recent, first-hand cases, and their
conclusions show that they had been able to free their minds to a very
remarkable extent from the influence of the traditional ghost-story,
they would have been more than human if they had achieved absolute
detachment.
Conditions were different when the Census Committee presented its
report (1894) and still more so when Mrs Sidgwick wrote her paper in
Proc, XXXIII. Cases from the mythical past could no longer be suspected
of influencing the judgment of enquirers into contemporary narratives.
If, therefore, any type of case is prominent in Phantasms and has quite, or
almost, faded out in Proc, XXXIII, it ought to be considered suspect,
unless, of course, supported by still more recent examples.
Most of thi cases in Phantastns seem to me unassailable on this score,
but I have long felt some doubts as to veridical collective apparitions, one
of the stock supports of the argument for physical objectivity. They are
discussed at length in Phantasms with several examples, many rather old,
but are poorly represented in the Census report and still more poorly in
Proc, XXXIII. In the main, however, and apart from this exceptional
instance, the authors of Phantasms acquit themselves of any inclination
towards accepting narratives as genuine because they embody incidents
of a kind imbedded in occult tradition.
In one other respect Phantasms shows a defect due to the rudimentary
u
304 W. H. Salter [Part
state of psychical research when it was written, namely in the treatment of ;
the evidence of adolescents. It is, I think, a fair inference from the out- 1 si
come of the experiments with the Creery sisters (see Proc, V, p. 269)^ j
that the authors had not yet realised the peculiar deceptiveness of what is ii
known as " the teen-age ", a factor first brought prominently to the notice ]
of psychical researchers by Podmore's article on Poltergeists, in Proc, XII. j
In the one case in the book which was later shown to be a hoax {Proc, XIV, i
p. 1 14), the principal witness was a youth of eighteen. It would not, how- i
ever, be reasonable to take either the Creery incident or the case of the
youth of eighteen as any indication that the early investigators of spon- t
taneous cases were easy victims of hoaxers. t
In the course of sixty-five years not a few attempts have been made to j
pull the Society's leg, some of them very ingenious and elaborate attempts. (
We may be fairly certain that any successful attempts would be trumpeted
j
abroad and exploited for all they were worth by hostile critics. How t
many successes have they claimed? [
The foregoing criticism of Phantasms as regards (i) veridical collective f
apparitions, and (2) cases depending on the evidence of adolescents,
affects, if it is well founded, only a very small proportion of the evidence [
set out in that book, and barely touches the later collections of cases, t
The serious question seems to me not as to the facts, but as to the inferences
j
to be drawn from them, and the problem of how far chance will account (
for them. Phantasms and the report on the Census built up an elaborate j
statistical argument to show the inadequacy of chance. But there is only f
one type of spontaneous case which can be forced into a quantitative
[
framework, namely, the so-called " death-coincidence ", and that only by (
the unsatisfactory procedure of disregarding all correspondences between j
experience and event other than the time-relation between them. This
[
weighted the scales in favour of chance. On the other hand, while the
|
Census Committee aimed at getting 50,000 answers to their questionnaire
they only obtained 17,000, rather a small number perhaps to carry much (
statistical superstructure. Fortunately both Mrs Sidgwick and Alice (
Johnson were well trained in scientific method, the former in physics, and y
the latter in biology, and they doubtless made as accurate an analysis of ,
the material as its nature admitted. t
Historical perspective is needed here. The enquiry was novel and the j
experimental data at the time of the Census were scanty. There has t
recently been a tendency to treat them as poor in quality as well as in j
quantity, and to make perhaps exaggerated assumptions of incompetence
on the part of the experimenters. However that may be, scanty the data
certainly were, and it was natural that an attempt should have been made
to eke them out by extracting the last statistical ounce from the refractory
material of the spontaneous cases.
Speaking for myself, I regard the close correspondence in a variety of
detail between experience and event as shown in a large number of cases
reported' by a host of percipients and witnesses, and examined by several
experienced critics over many years as being absolutely conclusive against
^ In these the authors withdrew some pubhshed evidence because in other
experiments with the same subjects held under different conditions cheating was
discovered.
175] A Cofnmentary on " The Investigation of Spontaneous Cases "

chance-coincidence. But I am painfully aware that this opinion is not
shared by all my fellow-members, not to mention the benighted millions
still without the fold. For those who seek a different kind of proof of
telepathy, experimental data are, through the labours of Mr Tyrrell,
Mr Carington, Dr Soal and others, as plentiful now as they were scarce
when Phantasms appeared, and that being so, the statistics regarding
death-coincidences in the early literature seem to me no longer of prime
importance.
But the complexity and variety of the spontaneous cases, which make
them unsatisfactory for the purposes of quantitative analysis, are precisely
the factors which give them value as an approach to the understanding
of the still more complex phenomena of trance-mediumship and automatic
writing, and, generally speaking, of the whole central problem of
personality. I cannot think that if Dr Rhine had been as familiar with
the spontaneous cases as he is with experimental E.S.P. he would ever
have put forward the paradox that " precognitive clairvoyance can account
for all the '
evidence '
on record for telepathy " (see Proc, Part 172).
It is therefore much to be regretted that, while in all probability cases
like those recorded in our early literature occur no less frequently than
they did a generation ago, by far the commonest type of spontaneous case
(so Dr West informs us) now being reported to the Society is the pre-
cognitive dream. Of all types of spontaneous case there is none of which
it is so hard to gauge the supernormal content (if any) as this. The
frequency of dreams increases the probability of chance-coincidence : the
prevalence of symbolism in dreams makes their interpretation problemati-
cal : prediction is worthless where there is doubt as to the thing predicted
and as to the time of fulfilment. These three factors in conjunction make
precognitive dreams, except in a few instances, of little value to the
psychical researcher.
Other types of spontaneous cases are most valuable, if properly
evidenced. Any evidential weaknesses that may have affected the value
of some of the earlier cases can be avoided if a few well-known but not
universally followed precautions are taken : a signed and dated statement
made as soon as practicable after the experience ;
independent corrobora-
tion, if possible ; careful verification of the event ; and so on. Detailed
advice can be obtained from the officers of the Society, and it is hoped
that many members will have occasion to consult them, so that the S.P.R.
may once more enjoy abundance of this very fruitful form of research.
FORECASTS AND PRECOGNITION
By C. Drayton Thomas
During the war of 1939-45 studies with Mrs Osborne Leonard were
interrupted and I could only visit her at irregular intervals. But at most
of these the future was mentioned with forecasts of coming military
events. With few exceptions these came to pass. Some of these events
could have been guessed by a mind which had the ability to ascertain the
plans, and the reserves in men and material, of the various belligerents.
But no single incarnate mind had this ability, and no one person at any
time knew all these facts.
The possession by my communicator of this ability, and this information
about military affairs, would sufficiently explain the accuracy of the
forecasts. There were, however, exceptions which do not easily admit of
this explanation. These would seem to have been instances of pure
precognition.
The words " forecast " and " precognition " are frequently used as
alternatives for the same thing. As I shall need to distinguish between
explicable forecasts and those which are at present inexplicable, the latter
will, in this paper, be termed " pure precognition ".
Both before, during, and after the war, my communicators gave forecasts
of events which were to concern me personally. These rarely failed to
materialise. Their accuracy impressed me, and it seemed desirable to
inquire if they could be explained. I found that they fell into groups
which will be here described and illustrated.
Class A
Forecasts based on Plans perceived in Human Minds,
OR on Circumstances unknown to the Recipients
Hospitality
My wife's parents, speaking through Feda, Mrs Leonard's control,
once told me that they were looking forward to seeing us shortly giving
hospitality to visitors : there would be two of them and possibly a third.
Neither my wife nor I could divine the meaning of this as we certainly
had no visitors in prospect. But two days later came a letter from my
wife's brother saying that he was coming to England with his son and
daughter, and that he wished to stay with us until his Bromley house
could be made ready ; that his son would probably go to a relative,
although that was not decided ;
anyhow two of them would come to us.
Thus the plan was clear-cut in his mind and the letter was on its way
when the forecast was given.
If, subsequently to the giving of a forecast, human plans are changed,
this may alter the date given for the foreseen event.
The Whitehead Bag
In my book, Life Beyond Death zvith Evidoice, p. 100, there is a full
306
[Part 175] Forecasts and Precognition 307
account of this striking forecast, apparently based on the communicator's
reading in the mind of my mother's friend, Mrs Whitehead, the intention
to give a present. Circumstances led to a postponement of the gift, but
the communicator persisted in the forecast, which proved to have been
correct.
Here is the story in brief.
At a sitting on December 22nd, 1922, my sister Etta (communicator)
asked me if our mother had received the gift of a bag. Feda continued
with a description, "A soft silk bag, not all one colour, studded or dotted
in design, or partly so." On January 5th I remarked that no such bag
had appeared.
Feda :
" Etta's idea was that it would be a Christmas gift to her
mother. It may have been delayed. For she still gets that idea and feels
that her mother will have that bag." That confidence was justified, for
the bag arrived and met the above description exactly. It was given on
my mother's birthday, January 27th, by Mrs Whitehead, who was then
on a visit to her. Mrs Whitehead informed me that she had made this
bag in the autumn, intending to present it at Christmas, but later decided
to keep it back for the birthday gift. When later I asked Etta how she
had ascertained her facts she replied that it was done in the usual way by
perceiving the thought in a person's aura.
Might this forecast be attributed to telepathic action? If so, by whom.'
Neither Mrs Leonard nor I had any conscious knowledge of the matter,
and the former had not met Mrs Whitehead.
Had any such forecast been received in dream or by impression or in
automatic script it would have been supernormal. As it was given by a
communicator who was apparently employing a faculty which to her is
normal, we may term it an instance of " paranormal telepathy ".
In this class "A" may be placed warnings of physical danger, of coming
misfortune, sickness or death, such as are received by impression, clair-
voyance, clairaudience, or in dreams.
One has an impression that a letter is about to arrive from so-and-so,
or that one will almost immediately meet such-and-such a person. These
impressions are so frequently justified by the event that they seem more
than chance coincidences.
There are also those compelling urges which lead the recipient to visit
some person, or render some service, not previously thought of. Clergy
have recounted such impressions which led them to visit some parishioner
whom they discovered to be in pressing need of their ministrations. A
friend tells me that his automatic writing one day named a family but
slightly known to him and stated that the people were in need. Tactful
inquiry elicited that the mother had remarked to her children that she
could only see her way to provide for the next two days and that after
that they might suffer want.
Such forecasts or impressions seem to be based on facts already
existing, or conditions which will eventuate in the facts. They may come
from the percipient's Subliminal Self, or from discarnate friends and
guardians.
We now pass to an extension of this type of forecast.

Class B
Forecasts based on Plans perceived in Human Minds, to which
Communicators add Plans of their Own and carry out the
combined Plan by influencing Human Action
The Luton Visit
During my first sitting with Mrs Leonard, February 3rd, 1917, a fore-
cast was given which Feda seemed only partly to understand and which
suggested nothing whatever to my mind. I quote from condensed notes
taken at the time :
There will be a little journey to take some temporary work and in
the end this will lead to something important. The work looks un-
important but will prove to be important. It is, say, about thirty miles
from London. Your guides are preparing for it and will see it through
with you. (Here came a pause of about one minute during which Feda
seemed to hold a whispered conversation with some person invisible to
me.) It seems to Feda that the importance is on account of someone
you will meet there.
I was perplexed and could understand nothing of this. My engagements
included several Sundays away from home, among them a Sunday School
Anniversary at Luton, with a Lecture on the Monday evening. As the
date for this, May 7th, drew near I was informed that my home would
be with a Mr and Mrs Squire. As we walked home from the morning
service Mrs Squire said that a remark of mine prompted her to ask if
I had read Sir Oliver Lodge's book Raymond, and if I knew anything
about the possibility of communication with those whom one had lost.
I replied suitably and she then told me of their having recently lost a son
in the war. We had several talks on the subject, and finally I invited her
to share my forthcoming sitting with Mrs Leonard. It was only then that
it occurred to me that as this was for her and her husband a very
important matter, it might be the work hinted at in the forecast.
Remembering that the foretold journey was to be one of " about thirty
miles " I inquired how far was Luton from London. The reply was,
" Thirty miles! " As this agreed with the forecast I was all the more
interested in the next remarks of my hostess, which were to the eff^ect
that she was glad I had come to them for these three nights as it had
given her a new outlook and hope, but that she had narrowly missed the
chance. She went on to explain that, on being asked to entertain me,
she had refused, because since losing their son they had been too sad to
enjoy social intercourse and preferred to be alone. However, the official
who arranged for the preacher's entertainment had asked her to reconsider,
and presently approached her a second time on the matter. She had
again refused, but when he asked her a third time, and was very pressing
about it, she finally, but with reluctance consented.
Realising by now that there might be more in this than appeared on
the surface, I wrote to the above church officer asking if he could confirm
what had been told me. He replied that, knowing I should be comfortable
with this family, he had felt a particular wish to put me with them and,
without knowing why, had felt unwilling to take a refusal.
lys] Forecasts and Precognition 309
Mrs Squire later accompanied me to a sitting with Mrs Leonard, at
which I witnessed a happy reunion with her son. Subsequently she went
alone and these sittings brought joy and thankfulness to her and the family.
This bears out the forecast given three months earlier : "It will lead
to something important . . . your guides are preparing for it and will see
it through with you. . . . The importance is on account of someone you
will meet there."
Consider how neatly these events dovetailed together.
A. I am engaged for Luton on a given date.
B. The entertainment official decides to ask Mr and Mrs Squire to
take me for the occasion.
C. He feels an unaccountable reluctance to accept their refusal and
finally overpersuades them.
D. A remark of mine leads Mrs Squire to ask about possibilities of
communication.
E. She finds the comfort and assurance needed.
I was struck by the persistence of the official in persuading the Squires
to entertain me, since there were many other homes to which I might
equally well have gone. Also that Luton should be the exact distance
from London named in the forecast. How unaccountable all this when
viewed from the standpoint of common experience, and yet how simple
to the enlightened mind! The need of the bereaved mother was perceived,
her prayers " heard ". My knowledge could help her. I was to be in
her town. The official could be impressed to get me to her house, and
she could be prompted to question me.
Mr and Mrs Squire had been unknown to me until this visit, nor had
I previously heard anything about them.
Here, as in other cases of this class, we note evidence of a purpose
which was not in the sitter's mind and cannot possibly be ascribed to
him. Whose purpose was it if not the communicator's?
Myers {H. P., p. 265) says : "I ascribe some precognitions to the
reasoned foresight of disembodied spirits . . . their not infallible inferences
from what they know."
Liverpool Street Station
At a sitting in April, 1935, I had a long conversation with Elsie, a lady
with whom I had close friendship in the long ago and whom I had hoped
to marry. She died. During this talk she made a forecast which puzzled
me at the time and to which I had absolutely no clue. Its substance was
as follows :
Quite soon you have to go to a place very closely associated with me.
You may not know yet that you will have to go, but when you do you
will say, " Oh, full of memories of her! " What I say now belongs to a
big subject, the plan of life. Part of our lives is planned, but we are
free co-operators. If we do not interfere, the plan outworks for us.
There is no forcing, but instinct guides us to co-operate with it. One
is free to fall in or to step aside. It applies to you ;
your steps are
being guided easily and firmly. Well, I have a feeling that soon you
will find yourself at a place associated in your mind with me. You
C. Drayton Thomas [Part
have been there several times and I have been there several times with
you. You think of me there where you walk down a little hill, not a
steep place, and if you notice it you'll remember other times.
Feda then added : When you get to a corner is there the word
"Avenue " written up, or is she only thinking "Avenue "?
As above remarked, I failed to find any satisfactory interpretation of
this and, as usual with forecasts, put the matter aside until time and the
event should explain it.
Six days later I went to Liverpool Street Station to meet my friend
Major Mowbray, whom I was to accompany for a meeting in Cambridge.
As there are two routes to Cambridge, via Kings Cross or Liverpool
Street, I had written to Mowbray asking him to decide which route and
train. So that it was he, and not I, who fixed the route. As I reached
the sloping road leading down into the station I realised that this fitted
with Elsie's forecast. It was impossible to enter that station without
recalling the many times we had been there together : indeed it was one
most memorable conversation we had there which finally led to our
engagement. On our many journeys together for days in town, this was
the station to which we came. It is for me ever redolent of her memory.
Thinking over the forecast during the journey, it occurred to me to
ask Major Mowbray if he would give me a list of the associations which
Liverpool Street Station brought to his mind. It seemed that he had
used the station for many years during his residence in Cambridge and
he gave me a longish list of its associations for him, but did not mention
" the hill ". Nor was he aware of any " avenue " thereabouts. I asked a
second person the same questions with the same negative result.
What then had the reference to "Avenue " meant? Elsie, having used
Liverpool Street Station all her life and done shopping in its neighbour-
hood, might well know the names of the streets better than most people.
I therefore inspected a map of the district : to my surprise it showed,
close by the station, two streets the names of which both ended with the
required word. There was Finsbury Avenue, a small and unattractive
lane, and Throgmorton Avenue which, I found when going there, displayed
its full name conspicuously on both sides at its end nearest to the station.
It is only some 200 yards distant from Liverpool Street Station.
Thus within six days of receiving the forecast I found myself fulfilling
it to the letter, and by no choice of my own, but by Major Mowbray's
choice to travel via Liverpool Street. Had he chosen the alternative
route the forecast would have failed. Why had Elsie risked it? My
theory is that, in such cases, the communicator relies on an ability to
influence the person concerned and, from previous practice, is fairly sure
of success.
The introduction of the word "Avenue " would seem to have been in
the nature of a clue, or an additional description, by which I might be
certain that I had discovered the place to which the forecast referred.
The Annunciation Picture
During a temporary residence at Harrogate I came to town for a sitting
on November 5th, 1942. On this occasion Elsie spoke for almost the whole
175] Forecasts and Precognition 3"
time. She began with a reference to background and foreground which,
as later appeared, was a designed preparation for the description of a
picture. Here is the substance of what was said :
Feda : Elsie is in the background of your mind while other things
are in the foreground. The slightest thing may bring her to your
recollection and into the foreground again. She is never lost on the
canvas of your memory, nothing dwarfs or so obscures that she is lost
in the picture. She is always there and is brought to the fore when
necessar}'. When one passes over, the background of that spiritual
canvas comes into the foreground. It would not be right for her to
come into the foreground all the time. She has helped you by being
in the background.
Now why this harping on the words background and foreground?
Evidently it was a preliminary devised to assist reference to a certain
picture of which she wished to speak.
Feda :
" Lilies "; she is giving me something about lilies, a picture
which should remind you of her. They are not real flowers, not in a
pot, but in a picture. And not only lilies but words also, something
about it should remind you of her and her position w-ith regard to you,
a sort of reassurance of all she stands for and remains in your life, even
if the words background and foreground are not literally given in this
picture.
Feda does not understand where this picture is, and it may be better
not to ask, as she might not be able to explain. She hopes you will
find it and get the message from this picture.
She says that occasionally she and Etta can impress you to act in
some way by influencing your mind. Before you come across anything
we tell you of, observe what happens to your consciousness a second or
two before ; there is a slight blank or suspension of thought. If you
will notice that you may realise that something is happening. She will
try to show you this picture.
The above would seem to have been a carefully prepared speech
planned to introduce references to a particular picture which I was to
look for and notice. That we had no such picture in our Bromley house
I was certain, and so resolved to inspect all pictures in our temporary
home at Harrogate on my return. I had arranged to spend the following
day with my cousin at Harpenden and there, during the evening, we sat
listening to the radio. When it came to the American Broadcast I was
sitting facing the fire and presently, wearied of listening, leaned back in
my chair with mind more or less vacant. Very suddenly came the thought
that I might use the opportunity for glancing around the room to see if
any of the 'pictures showed lilies. After inspecting three of the walls I
turned round to see what might be behind me. At once I noticed a
picture representing an angel with the annunciation lily in her hand.
Rising to make a closer examination, I noticed that it met exactly the
description given at the sitting. These were its chief features :
"Background; Foreground". The background is strikingly separated -
. from the foreground by a distance of several miles ; far away one sees
312 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
water with shipping and an island. There is almost nothing but fore-
ground and background. Elsie and I often visited picture galleries and
she was a keen observer of detail.
" Position with regard to me ". The angel speaking to Mary (one
from the Beyond with a message to one on earth) is analagous to Elsie from
her life in the Beyond speaking to me.
" Get the message from this picture ". It will be recollected that the
angel said to Mary, " Hail, thou that art highly favoured " (Luke i, 28).
I am indeed highly favoured in many ways, and that Elsie thinks so has
been abundantly shown by her in many previous messages.
This discovery of the picture and its apposite character came as a real
surprise to me. That the urge to look for the picture came suddenly
when my mind was somewhat blank favours the idea that Elsie was
prompting me to look for it. Feda had said, " She will try to show you
this picture."
How do I interpret this incident? Something as follows : Elsie would
know that I was to visit my cousin, either from her own observation of my
thoughts or in conversation with my father and Etta. They would, if
she required it, show her the house and leave her to select some object
there which would be suitable for a test message. The presence of a plan
is the outstanding fact, and the plan included a reliance on so influencing
my mind that I should notice the picture which she had selected for the
forecast.
It was some six years since I had been in this room and I was unaware
that my cousin possessed any such picture. The parallel suggested
between an angel speaking to Mary and Elsie's communications was an
idea so entirely new that I am positive it had never entered my thought.
I think that the events above recorded warrant the conclusion that
invisible helpers not only perceive intentions in human minds, but that
they sometimes exert a telepathic influence by which they contrive to
guide human actions into harmony with their own purposes.

Dr A. T. Shearman
My sister Etta and I had been on intimate terms with Dr A. T. Shearman
and his wife. He had been a widower for many years when, in June, 1936,
Etta gave a long communication for him from his wife, emphasising that
I was not to forward it until hearing from him, which she was confident I
should presently do. I had last seen Arthur Shearman in June, 193 1,
and we rarely wrote except at Christmas. Etta realised that this message
(which contained some 650 words and many evidential items about which
I knew nothing) was part of a plan and intended to achieve some purpose
about which I was kept in the dark.
In September I had a letter from Arthur with a gift of his latest book.
With my reply was enclosed the above communication.
Arthur sent me a full annotation on the evidence which had evidently
greatly impressed him, for he said, among other appreciative remarks.
1 75] Forecasts and Precognition 313
" I am bound to say that in my judgment proof is established. ... 1 did
not look forward to a revelation so really important from a scientific point
of view and as welcome to myself as this is."
In giving me her message Etta had remarked,
" I think there is some reason for her wishing to help Arthur but
don't say anything about this part ;
just keep to yourself what she says
now. She feels he needs help himself, but doesn't wish to say that to
him."
On my reporting at the next sitting that Arthur was impressed by the
message, Etta remarked, " It may help him. It is the right time for it.
There have been things happening with Arthur, developments that you
don't know anything about."
It was only three months later that the reason for this communication
from Arthur's wife became apparent. He died the following January
after some months illness. From his doctor I then ascertained that it
was just about the time when his illness entered its final stage that the
communication had reached him. It would seem, therefore, that my
communicators realised from Arthur's health condition that the end was
not far distant and had therefore planned to cheer him by messages
proving the identity of his wife and her intimate acquaintance with his
doings. Note Etta's confident prediction that Arthur would be writing
to me.
(A more complete account of this incident was published in the S.P.R.
Journal for November, 1937.)
Here again purpose is evident, but it was not any purpose of the sitter
and cannot be ascribed to any incarnate human being.

Forecasts made by Communicators based on
Plans made by Themselves
The Foretold Letters
On several occasions it has been announced in my sittings that I shall
shortly receive a letter ; details are then given by which this letter may
be recognised. Here are two illustrations :
On October 28th, 1938, my communicators inquired if I had recently
received a letter from a middle-aged man about his son. As I had not,
they gave me some particulars about the case.
Within two weeks came a letter which met the forecast, and in a
correspondence which followed, it appeared that the writer's deceased son
had prompted his father to write, hoping thereby to establish communica-
tion with his father through Mrs Leonard. >
A second case is on similar lines.
March 17th, 1939 :
Feda : Will you keep a lookout for a letter asking you about a lady,
not one we have had, a new one. I think that someone has written, or
is writing, to ask if you can help about her. The one she's expecting
to write is a man.
314 C.Drayton Thomas [Part
After certain identifying details had been given we continued :
C. D. T. : Won't it be a pity, Feda, if after taking all this trouble
I don't get any inquiry?
Feda : I think you will and soon. . . . The lady seems satisfied and
says, " /'// see what I can do.'' (Italics are mine : note this intention of
exerting influence.)
Ten days later I received a letter from a Mr C. G. Netherton of
Bournemouth. Correspondence followed and we found that out of thirty-
one items given for purposes of identification, twenty-three were definitely
accurate. Mr Netherton told me that the idea of writing to me had been
in his mind since March 2nd, but that he only decided to send the letter
a day or two before he actually did so. Mr Netherton informs me that
his wife had been a firm believer in the possibility of psychic communica-
tion. It looks as if she had been impressing him to write, and that a belief
in her ability to do so was the ground of her forecast that I should hear
from him. Other letters of a like character have been similarly foretold.
The inference is obvious.
The foregoing classes B, C, D, can be best explained by the ability of
communicators to ascertain the thoughts and intentions of men, sub-
conscious as well as conscious, and by plans formed in communicators'
own minds. With those data they proceed to draw inferences in accordance
with psychological laws as familiar to us as to them. It may well be that,
in addition to this means of acquiring their data, they make use of causal
laws, whether physical or psychological or both, about which we on earth
know nothing. Consider how a meteorologist bases his forecasts of
coming weather on a knowledge of laws governing atmospheric move-
ments which are unfamiliar to ordinary people.

A Further Class of Forecasts may be in the Nature of Experiments
which discarnate intelligences undertake for purposes of their own
The Garage Proprietor
We once owned a house in Ramsgate. My parents occupied it until
my father's death. Later it was sold and my mother rented a house on
the sea-front. I frequently visited her, and always put my car in a nearby
garage. The following was given eight years after my mother's death.
Tlie Forecast
Feda : Your mother says she feels you may be hearing about
Ramsgate and the old days there. She feels it strongly ;
it is strange
how she feels it. Not very interesting, but will take your mind back to
her other house there, also some talk about property.
Here are the stenographer's paragraphs relating to the above :
Feda : Your mother says, I just wanted to say that I felt that you
might be hearing some news from people at Ramsgate.
C. D. T. : Oh, really?
Feda : Yes, and she is not sure if it's important news and she is not
175] Forecasts and Precognition 315
even sure if it's coming from Ramsgate, but it will be about Ramsgate
and about the old days at Ramsgate. She felt it very strongly, she says.
It's strange how she feels it. (Here I suggested that possibly the idea
originated in my having recently read some letters she wrote me from
Ramsgate long ago.)
Feda : She thinks not, because she knew about those old letters. . . .
She feels something more than that, something from other people,
something from outside.
C. D. T. : I will look out for it with interest.
Feda : Yes, it will be interesting because she has mentioned it ; but
she doesn't think very interesting otherwise. She thinks that it may
specially be about property there. You remember the other house
she had?
C. D. T. : Very well.
Feda : She feels that there may be some allusion to it, or something
that will take your mind back to that other house. That's what she feels.
Note in the above how appropriate to the later event are the words :
" hearing some news about Ramsgate
"
" not important
"
" not sure if it's coming from Ramsgate
"
" thinks it may specially be about property there
"
" feels that there may be some allusion to it (her old house Birkdale)
or something that will take your mind back to that other house."
The Fulfilment
Exactly three weeks after the above was spoken at my sitting, a gentleman
accosted me in Bromley High Street. He introduced himself as the
proprietor of the garage I had so regularly used at Ramsgate, and we
exchanged reminiscences of my cars and of my driving with my mother.
He inquired about her and then asked if we still had our old house. I
replied telling him of its sale and of the other house my mother afterwards
rented. From this he proceeded to tell me that he was living just outside
Bromley, but had decided to go back to Ramsgate and was now inquiring
about houses there. He then showed a letter which had that morning
come from a house-agent and which offered him a house and a bungalow.
We spent some time discussing the relative merits of these two properties.
Only after we parted did I realise that this conversation had fulfilled the
forecast so recently given.
I am well aware that ultra-critical people may assign this forecast to
the action of delayed telepathy between this gentleman and the medium
or me. And indeed there seemed to be a possibility, which I saw on
reflection, of some such telepathic explanation. It might be something as
follows : This gentleman seeing me in Bromley decided to speak when
opportunity offered. On receiving the letter from the house-agent about
properties in Margate and Ramsgate he decided to discuss it with me
should we shortly meet. This intention, being fairly strong and directed
to me, reaches my aura where it remains deciperable. Let us therefore
suppose that Feda during the sitting becomes aware of it, but mistakenly
attributes it to my mother who is then speaking.
I did not consider this suggestion in any way satisfactory ; it seemed to
3i6 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
raise more difficulties and improbabilities than it solved. But it decided
me to put questions should I again meet the garage proprietor. A
meeting came about accidentally this morning and I write this immediately
on reaching home. He had seen me in Bromley, but that was four years
ago on his first arrival in the neighbourhood. As he had not seen me again
he concluded that I no longer lived here.
This seems to dispose of the telepathy hypothesis and to absolve the
gentleman from any thought about me which could have brought about
the forecast.
How then shall the forecast be explained ? My mother, on being asked
this at a later sitting, could only reply that she had felt it strongly, but did
not know how the idea came to her.
My Suggested Explanation
On thinking the matter over there emerged from my store of memories
one which seemed to form some basis for a reasonable hypothesis. My
sister had long ago described how plans were made in higher spheres and
passed thence to those whose work lay with earth. " Suppose," she said,
" the thought is sent that the poor in London should almost immediately
be assisted in some special way. It goes forth as an impersonal message
urging help to the needy. As it is passed down through the spheres it
gains individuality until it would be caught by some who, when on earth,
were in touch with London conditions and possibly by some whose
friends were living there in poverty. The next step will be that promptings
are given strongly by them to social workers, or charitable persons, who
so become impressed with the idea that something should be done."
More was said, but the above suffices for our purpose. It states that
some of the plans made in the Beyond require human co-operation and
that therefore human minds have to be impressed.
It would be natural that general directions should be given out by beings
of greater experience and wisdom and passed down to others for applica-
tion in detail. The latter may not always understand the plans in which
they thus take part and help bring into effect. This is the method
adopted by National Governments when higher officials issue general
directions which are carried out in detail by subordinates.
If such be actually the case, we can understand how it is that some
communicators give forecasts which they themselves do not understand,
but merely " feel ", and also that some of these dimly perceived directions
may have a scientific or experimental purpose in view.
One can realise that the impressing of human minds is not easy. Some
would have more aptitude for it than others. In my long experience of
receiving messages from first-time communicators it has been noticeable
that, while some did well, most did it indifferently and many failed to be
effective. This being so when it is a case of impressing the Control
during the favourable conditions of a sitting, how much more uncertain
must be the impressing of men and women who are in the midst of their
daily avocations and preoccupied!
To quote my sister again, " We have to learn the effect of our power
and to what extent it may be distorted or interfered with on your side."
Many will prove unreceptive and others unresponsive.
Forecasts and Precognition
Another statement may be suggestive when added to the foregoing.
We are told that in the Beyond there are groups of people who were
interested in psychic studies while here and who pursue them still. One
can imagine how such persons will wish to discover to what extent their
telepathy is reliable when directed to minds on earth. To discover this
they would need to experiment. And each new arrival who elected to
work for earth would find it necessary to practise this art.
The Plan
With the foregoing in mind let us picture how the particular forecast
we are discussing might have been planned.
Certain facts would be already known to the planners.
1. That the garage proprietor and I both resided in Bromley.
2. That he was hoping to get a house in Ramsgate.
3. That he would remember me, my mother and her house, . .
The problem of the planners would therefore be :
A. To bring about our meeting.
/
B. To impress him to speak to me.
C. To induce him to refer to Ramsgate days, our house there, and to
property.
Should they succeed in this it would be evidence to them that their tele-
pathic effort was successful ; if it failed they must learn how to become
more effective.
The plan succeeded as foretold. The garage proprietor was led to
cross my path. While walking along the street I noticed a slightly
familiar face approaching. Not recollecting the name or the place where
I had seen him, I should certainly have passed by had he not accosted me.
It was he who spoke to me and asked if I did not recognise him. So the
telepathic influence would seem to have been exerted on him and not on
me. I was taking my usual shopping route, whereas he was rarely in
Bromley. I have seen him but once since and that was a few days after.
That he should on this very morning have received the letter offering him
a choice of properties made it the ideal day for bringing about the fulfilment
of the forecast.
How long previously this may have been planned we cannot guess, but
its fulfilment was twenty-one days after my receiving the forecast.
Further Speculations
How came the plan to be made the subject of a forecast? It may be
that to make my mother " feel it strongly " and then tell me of it at the
sitting was an exceptional addition to ordinary procedure. Possibly the
planners were testing their ability to impress my mother from their
higher sphere ; if so, that would account for her receiving the impression
vaguely and without full detail.
Another suggestion would be that my mother happened to catch the
thought which was directed to me by planners on a sphere beyond hers.
My father, speaking through Mrs Leonard, once told me that he had caught
the idea of a building close to our house. This seemed most unlikely to
happen, yet the event proved that my next door neighbour had been
I
C. Drayton Thomas [Part
planning to build, and did presently build, a garage close to our dividing
fence. Many similar instances could be given.
Again, it is conceivable that the planners wished to draw my attention
forcibly to the subject of precognition with a view to emphasising the fact
of their planning for earth. Certainly this incident, together with others
about the same time, did very definitely cause me to begin a study of
precognition.
Whether the above speculations are in accord with fact or not, it is,
I consider, highly probable that such plans are frequently decided on,
even if rarely made the subject of forecasts. Can we suppose that ardent
investigators of psychic problems lose their interest when transported to
another realm of life? Would they not be curious to investigate from
their new standpoint.? Others may have done it before, but each who
wished to work for the good of humanity would need to learn for himself
how to influence human minds. Until this can be done with some degree
of certainty no important work for earth could be undertaken. Such
experimental practice might well be sometimes made the subject of a
forecast, as providing a more definite mark at which to aim. And the
fact that the majority of forecasts relate to unimportant matters is in
accord with this suggestion ; for it is just such trivial forecasts which
prove most arresting to us on account of their unlikelihood and which also
least interfere with the usual course of our lives!
That a certain amount of experimenting is undertaken by some in the
Beyond is a conclusion suggested by other instances. My father, in the
course of earlier sittings, often spoke of his wish to discover whether he
could do so-and-so. Often he failed, sometimes he succeeded. The
Myers communicator at Mrs Willett's sittings once said, " I am now
going to begin fresh experiments. You might tell Mrs Verrall, when
opportunity occurs, that the need for experiment from this side has not
been sufficiently grasped on your side."
It would not follow that those who may be planning to influence human
minds in order to achieve some particular end are uniformly wishful to
give a forecast of the hoped-for result. These forecasts are infrequent
and, of course, the opportunity for giving us information beforehand is
limited.
Reference might be made to the series of Cross Correspondences which
were obviously attempts at instructive and cleverly devised experiments,
(See S.P.R. Proceedings for June, 191 1 and several later numbers.)
In Human Personality, Vol. 2, p. 275, Myers says, " Experiments, I say,
there are ;
probably experiments of a complexity and difliculty which
surpass our imagination ; but they are made from the other side of the
gulf, by the eff'orts of spirits who discern pathways and possibilities which
for us are impenetrably dark. We should not be going beyond the truth
if we described our sensitives as merely the instruments, our researchers
as merely the registrars, of a movement which we neither initiated nor
can in any degree comprehend."
If Myers found good ground for believing that experiments were
planned and carried out by the discarnate, much more can we ; for since
his day we have had, besides the Cross Correspondence series, Book
Tests, and then experiments with The Times, in which names and words
175] Forecasts and Precognition 319
were given which would be found in the morrow's issue, although not
yet in type at the hour when the forecast was given.
Experimental forecasts indicate an important line of evidence for the
continued activity and interest in our doings of those who have preceded
us into a more exalted sphere of life.
Class F
Pure Precognition
A few of the forecasts received by me through Mrs Leonard look like
pure precognition, i.e. veridical cognition of the future obtained by some
means other than rational inference. I give as examples the two following.
The Eastwood Sisters
During a Leonard sitting on December 17th, 1943, while Feda was
speaking for my sister Etta, she remarked that a visitor was coming to
stay at our house. This struck me as absurdly impossible, for the follow-
ing reasons. We had but recently resumed occupation after having closed
the house for three years. Our two maids, both over sixty, were now
exerting themselves to the utmost in cleaning the place from attic to cellar
and although the task was far from ended they were both visibly weary
and overworked. It was out of the question to impose extra labour on
them, such as a visitor would involve. Besides this, my wife was seriously
ill, so ill indeed that it was necessary to obtain outside help in nursing her,
and a Miss Eastwood came for this purpose each morning. As for myself,
household shopping and attendance on my wife left no leisure for entertain-
ing visitors. We were all living under pressure of exacting conditions.
And so I regarded this announcement as nonsense.
Yet the visitor actually came and stayed w'ith us five nights!
About midnight on Sunday, the 2nd of January, there was a short air
raid over Bromley, where we reside. Two bombs fell near the town
centre but did not explode. The Fire Wardens therefore cordoned off
adjacent streets and shephered the residents to a public shelter where
they might remain until the bombs should have exploded or been removed.
Among these people were the above-mentioned Miss Eastwood and her
two sisters. The former arrived next morning looking tired and over-
wrought. She informed our maids of the night's experience and of the
public shelter in which they had sat, cold and miserable, until daybreak.
She also mentioned that they were to make that shelter their home for a
probable five nights, and were dismayed at the prospect.
Our housemaid repeated the story to me and then suggested that it
would be a kindness to offer the three sisters the use of our spare rooms.
Realising that this housemaid would have to shoulder the chief part of
all extra work involved, and as the cook said she had no objection, I
discussed the matter with my wife and we then invited the three sisters
to come. They accepted the invitation and spent the following five
nights at our house.
Here are verbatim notes of the forecast given sixteen days before.
Feda : Etta wanted to say that she got a very strong impression
—
320 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
this may be something to do with Clara—of someone coming back
into your house that was connected with it before.
C. D. T. : Very unHkely!
Feda : Very unHkely, perhaps, to your mind, but very likely to hers.
She wants you to remember that.
C. D. T. : What makes you think that, Etta?
Feda : She gets a strong feeling of a return of someone.
C. D. T. : I wonder how you get that feeling.
Feda : She says, I can't quite explain it in words that would convey
it to you.
C. D. T. : We are not thinking of having anyone and I doubt if
anyone is thinking of coming.
Feda : It's not quite an ordinary visitor, but rather quickly, rather
suddenly ; don't think I mean today or tomorrow, I'm not quite sure
of that. But what I mean is—wait a minute—that when they come
they will come without very much notice or—do you see? perhaps no
notice. She feels as if they might come, as it would appear, suddenly
to you ; and she does feel it is someone who has been linked up with
your house. It's like a return of someone, and don't put it out of your
mind because you don't think it could possibly happen. It is certainly
nothing you have arranged for, nothing at all ; and she just leaves it at
that.
Note in the above remarks :
1. " This may be something to do with Clara ". Clara is my wife, and
her dressmaker for thirty years has been one of the Eastwood sisters.
2. " Someone who has been linked up with that house. It is like a
return of someone." The dressmaker has often visited our house, besides
which she spent two of her summer holidays here. Her sister, as previously
mentioned, had been coming daily to help.
It will be noticed that Feda said " someone " and also " they "; the
latter word was probably used because Feda was not told the sex of the
person in question.
3. How perfectly apposite were the phrases used :
" a return," " to
do with Clara," " someone coming back into your house that was
connected with it before," " not quite an ordinary visitor," " rather
quickly, rather suddenly," " someone who has been linked up with that
house," " nothing you have arranged for ".
All the above are accurate descriptions of what came to pass. It was
only after the invitation had been given and accepted that its relevancy to
this forecast occurred to me : for the forecast had in the meantime quite
passed from my memory.
Note the chain of events which led to the fulfilment of my sister's
forecast. Of these there were five :
1. A German airman flew over Bromley dropping two bombs ; and
of all the extensive area of the town it was within a small rectangle of
streets which included the Eastwoods' home that they fell.
2. These were delayed-action bombs. Had they exploded on falling it is
unlikely that the Eastwood sisters would have quitted their house.
3. Two of these sisters had been intimately connected with my wife,
175] Forecasts and Precognition 321
4. But for the fact that one of them was now in daily attendance at our
house we should have remained unaware of their plight.
5. Had not the housemaid suggested our offering hospitality it would
not have occurred to me to invite them.
Our guests remained with us for five nights. And so it was that various
" chance happenings " combined to bring about the exact fulfilment of
the prediction given at my sitting sixteen days before
!
Was the German bomber impressed, influenced (term it how we may),
to drop his bombs at the particular spot and moment which would bring
about the event as foreseen.? We do not know!
I am confident that this fulfilment was no chance coincidence, but
further than this I cannot go. It will have been noticed that Etta " gets a
strong feeling ", and when I express a wish to know more, she says, " I
can't explain it in words that would convey it to you."
The source of feeling is often elusive even with ourselves, especially
with faint impressions that so-and-so is likely to happen ; and it might
well be that Etta, while aware of the feeling, was far from clear as to its
origin. On the other hand she might have known something of the laws
of cause and effect, as they operate on realms above earth, but despaired
of her ability to convey to me anything that I should find intelligible.
And so I have placed this Eastwood forecast here where it may serve
to illustrate that class of precognitions which, up to the present, has defied
the human intellect to explain it. One may make guesses but guessing
introduces factors about which we make other guesses. To " expkin
"
the unknown by other unknowns would satisfy neither the reader nor me.
The Turn of the Tide at El Alamein
In the spring of 1941 the British Army of Occupation in Libya was
chivalrously depleted to provide an Expeditionary Force for the succour
of the Greeks. The Germans seized the chance of sending over the
powerful force with which Rommel hoped to invade Egypt. By
November 1941 Rommel was raiding the Egyptian frontier. Then we
had some successes and forced him back so resolutely that by December
6th our patrols were raiding 150 miles into Tripoli. Shortly after this we
broke Rommel's front and captured Benghazi.
Then came our reverses and before the end of January 1942 Rommel
had retaken Benghazi.
The following June we had to retire to the Egyptian frontier, but left a
considerable garrison to hold Tobruk. In June we lost Tobruk and
some 25,000 of its garrison. Then Rommel captured Mersa Matruh and
we lost another 6,000 men. By June 30th the Germans were within 90
miles of Alexandria!
That was our worst plight and only relieved by the assurance that
reinforcements were on their way round the Cape of Good Hope.
On July ist, fighting was resumed around El Alamein. By the nth
we had taken 2,000 prisoners and another 4,000 by the 19th. When
General Auchinleck relinquished the command he was able to announce
that in the previous two months we had captured 10,000 of the enemy.
It was on August i8th, 1942 Lieut-General Montgomery was given
command of the 8th Army, and on October 23rd began an all-out off'ensive.
322 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
It was successful. By November 3rd Rommel's forces were in disorderly
retreat. Two weeks later the Germans were driven out of Cyrenaica and our
church bells were ringing for the victory. That was the first stage in the
German retreat, which continued intermittently until the only Germans
left alive in North Africa were in our prisoners' cages.
This decisive victory, a turning point of the war, was gained at the end of
October and the first days of November. According to an official account,
announced by the B.B.C., the actual turn of the tide began on October ^oth.
At midsummer I came down from Yorkshire to take sittings with Mrs
Leonard. The full text of my records are given later ; for the moment
I limit them to this summary :
June T,oth 1942. Your father feels sure that something very, very
important comes in October. " He keeps writing 28th, and 29th,
October, and turning something over then."
This crucial date was also given by another communicator. At a
Leonard sitting on August 26th 1942, the Rev. A. F. Webling was told
by his communicator son :
" I've got a date in my mind. As I told you, I don't always know
these things about the future . . . but in my mind recently a date keeps
coming up. I ought to say two dates next each other ;
something
about October 28th and 29th ;
something to do with the war. And
I feel it is a turning point of a very, very vital kind, very outstanding. I
seldom get anything like that. It is as if a little door opens and some-
thing pops out, almost as if it were thrown out, saying, '
Take that.'
This date came and my own mind has to interpret it. And I interpret
it as having a very grave bearing on the war which will prove to our
advantage. Father, I felt relief. (This was spoken in the direct voice.)
I would like you to underline that." .
Thus we find that the date given by my father sixteen weeks before
the event was repeated by another communicator a clear nine weeks before
the striking fulfilment on October 30th.
The date thus twice forecast proved to be the turning-point of the war
in North Africa, the start of that invincible progress of our Eighth Army
which brought our troops to Tripoli and Tunis, then through Sicily and
far up the Italian Peninsula, and finally by way of Normandy, Brussels
and the Rhine to the shores of the Baltic. And with never a setback or
retreat!
On November 12th, 1942, General Montgomery's Order of the Day
said :
" We have completely smashed the German and Italian Armies."
He reported 30,000 prisoners already taken. That battle was the turning
point of our war in N. Africa ; it had started on October 23rd, and by
November 3rd the enemy had begun a disorderly retreat. The actual
turn of the tide of battle was October 30th, when Rommel began his
flight from El Alamein. (This was officially reported by the B.B.C.) Our
actual and final breakthrough was on November ist.
The Daily Telegraph' s review of events, given that December, said,
"Autumn witnessed the passing of the general strategic initiative from
the hands of the Axis to those of the United Nations. ... It was not,
175] Forecasts (Did Pi ecug)iiUon 323
liowever, till the end of October that the United Nations may be said to
have begun demonstrably to capure the initiative."
Thus was fulfilled the forecast that something important would mark a
turning point at the end of October.
How confidently the Germans had expected to capture Alexandria is
shown by a newsreel composed of shots taken by German cameramen in
Libya. This newsreel was captured in North Africa and is dated October
26th, 1941. In it the commentator says, " Rommel's invincible troops
are about to start this offensive," and the impression is given that the end
of British offensive is but a matter of days. Little was it expected that
by November 4th our Eighth Army would have won the smashing victory
of El Alamein. This film was being shown in North Africa on November
8th, 1942, when the Allies landed there. (From a correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph.)
On receiving this forecast I posted a copy to Mr Saltmarsh who
acknowledged its receipt and later wrote me about its fulfilment which
he had discussed with a friend. When Mr Webling sent me a copy of
his communicator's repetition of this same forecast I sent this also to be
kept with mine for future reference. On Mr Saltmarsh's death these
were deposited with the S.P.R. Thus there are witnesses that at a date
four months before the event—and again two months before it—this
crucial date of the end of October had been given.
Was any such forecast in the mind of our highest military circles? It
was known at the end of June that substantial reinforcements were on
their way, but the ships were taking the long route round the Cape.
Had their date of arrival been approximately known, also the period that
must elapse before those reinforcements could reach the battle front, it
would have been a risky guess to give October 28th and 29th as the date
on which those reinforcements would turn the scales in our favour. Yet
the communicators gave the precise date, the only modification made by
my father in June was that the important event might happen earlier.
Even if we suppose that some mind, or minds, were holding this date as
the probable turning-point, how are we to explain the thought being
picked up and made to emerge at Mrs Leonard's trance sitting? Merely to
suggest " telepathy " is to evade the question ; for we have no conception
of the way by which thoughts travel from mind to mind, or are possibly
shared by minds, apart from our everyday methods of exchanging ideas
by word, writing, or arbitrary signs. Nor is the telepathic theory applic-
able to the forecast given above. The Eastzvood Sisters.
The key to the problem of pure precognition might possibly be either,
(a) some higher dimension of Time, or {b) perception by intelligences on
grades of existence higher than that of our communicators and whose
abilities enable them to make use of causal laws unguessed by mortal
man. These alternatives are not mutually exclusive and both might come
into play. But on such matters we are guessing in the dark.
The result of Dr Soal's experiments with Mr B. Shackleton {S.P.R.
Proceedings for December 1943) confirms the reality of pure precognition.
We may again quote what Myers says in Human Personality, p. 265 :
" I suspect that it is not by wider purview, wiser inference alone, that
finite minds, in the bodv or out of it, have attained to knowledge of what
324 C. Diavfon Thomas [Part
yet must be. 1 imagine that the Continuity of the Universe is complete ;
and that therefore the hierarchy of intelhgences between our minds and
the World-Soul is infinite ; and that somewhere in that ascent a point is
reached where our conception of time loses its accustomed meaning."
Page 390 :
" Nor can we guess how high may be the communicating
intelligence, how far-reaching its prefigurement of what for us has yet to
be. We are led thus to our last, our boldest conjecture . . . the possibility
of a knowledge which comes to man from no individual, or at least from
no human source : which is no longer inference but the reflection of
Reality itself."
In some instances it is difficult to decide whether the forecast should
be classed as experimental or a pure precognition. Consider the following
two. First one from Mrs A. W. Verrall's paper on her "Automatic
Writings " (S.P.R. Proceedings for October 1906, p. 331). In December
1 90 1 she wrote of a man reading by candle-light a book Marmontel ; it
was borrowed, and one of two volumes. The following was given as a
clue to this, " Passy may help. Souvenirs de Passy or Fleury."
On March ist, 1902, a Mr Marsh came on a visit and mentioned that
he had been reading Marmontel. On being asked to say under what
circumstances he had read this book, his replies bore out the forecast.
On February 21st he had read the first volume, which contained an
account of the finding at Passy of a panel connected with the story in
which Fleury played an important part.
There were a few inaccuracies, but so close an agreement between the
script and the fact as to preclude chance coincidence. The account is
impressive and should be studied in full.
As written it looked like a reminiscence and not a forecast of the future,
the script of December giving the incident as in the past : whereas it did
not actually occur until the following February. Was this part of the test
blurred during reception.' It looks more like an experiment than pure
precognition ; for the words introducing it were, " Nothing too mean,
the trivial helps, gives confidence. Hence this."
We cannot easily imagine the means by which a communicator might
have contrived to bring about a fulfilment of the forecast, but we may
assume that he would rely upon laws psychological and causal at present
unknown to us.
*
The second case is given by Myers in S.P.R. Proceedings for December
1899, p. 487. It has often been quoted in abbreviated form, but should
be read in full.
Mrs Atlay, wife of the then Bishop of Hereford, dreamed that she
read prayers in the Palace Hall during her husband's absence ; that prayers
being ended she opened the dining room door and saw between table and
sideboard a large pig!
When morning came Mrs Atlay recounted her dream to the children
and their governess and presently read family prayers, the Bishop being
away. She then opened the dining room door and was astonished to see
an enormous pig standing in the spot where she had seen it in her dream.
Questions by Myers brought answers showing that the pig was not in the
Palace at the time of the dream, but safely in its sty. It had entered the
room while gardeners cleaned the sty and prayers were in progress.
175] Forecasts and Precognition 325
Servants coming for prayers had left all doors open. The pig had
wandered some distance to enter the house.
Is this a case of the purely precognitive faculty, which possibly lies
dormant in us all? Or could it have been the result of an experiment by
some discarnate humorist, who either saw his opportunity in the unfastened
sty and open doors of the Palace, or who had influenced those concerned
to give the pig its chance, and then, trying his powers on the animal, had
guided its wanderings?
Myers wrote (see Human Personality, p. 390) :
" In many of our cases
there is absolutely no clue to the source of precognitions ; and we may
ascribe all these, if we will, to the Subliminal Self without extraneous aid.
Yet, on the other hand, there are many cases where the agency of
unembodied spirits is asserted, and with evidence that cannot be ignored."
CONCLUSION
Reviewing our examples, we note that those least difficult to understand
related to human plans already existing in some incarnate mind. It would
seem that our purposes can sometimes be observed by friends in the
Beyond and made the foundation for a statement that such-and-such a
thing will come to pass. And it usually happens! But if, meanwhile,
we change our plan, or its execution should be delayed, the forecast
becomes to that extent inaccurate.
Secondly, we found a type of forecast which seemed to depend on the
ability of agents in the Beyond to use, and perhaps modify, our human
plans, adapting them to plans of their own.
Thirdly, we saw that human co-operation is occasionally asked for in
psychic sittings which provide opportunity for the request.
A fourth class, somewhat similar to the second, differs from it in that
the original plan, which forms the groundwork, was not man's but one
devised in the Beyond.
We thus conclude that in such forecasts of the future we have a body
of evidence for the existence of intelligent action in minds other than
those of earth.
It has been suggested that Time is an illusion, or that there is a different
time-scale in other-world conditions, so that events yet to happen here
have already happened there. Doubtless this is attractive to students of
relativity, and even to the man-in-the-street who knows that what he sees
when looking at the star Sirius is that which happened there some eight
years ago, and that what takes place on Sirius today cannot be observed
from earth until another eight years have elapsed. Yet such considerations
do not lead me to feel satisfied that, if I see a car accident this day week
opposite my house, it has already happened in ethereal realms!
Hence I have suggested explanations which do not run counter to life
as we know it, and which agree with what we are told of activities in the
life Beyond. It is, in brief, that higher minds can infer, from what they
observe, combined with what they themselves plan to do, that such and such
an event will presently happen. Compare this with the planning of
enterprising business men, of Cabinet Ministers, of Generals in wartime.
326 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
What these do in earthly life is done, I suggest, by their predecessors in
the Great Beyond.
There remains a Mysterious Aspect of Precognition
When we have sorted out collections of forecasts and glimpsed possible,
or even probable, explanations of the simpler types, there remain some
for which any explanation so far suggested seems highly improbable.
What, for instance, are we to think of the two cases, Eastwood Sisters and
Turn of the Tide at El Alamein} or of the Gordon Davis Case} In the
latter there was minutely and accurately described to Dr S. G. Soal at his
sittings, a house and some conspicuous articles of its furniture. Yet the
future occupant of that house did not go to reside there until eleven
months later and it was his occupation and his furniture which had been
described in the forecast. At the date of Dr Soal's sitting other people
were living in that house and some of the furniture described had not yet
come into the possession of its future occupant! (A full account of this
noteworthy case is given in the S.P.R. Proceedings for December 1925,
PP- 569-589-).
On my briefly recounting this Gordon Davis Case to one of my
communicators he said, " With regard to the apparent knowledge of facts
as they would be at a future time—so it seems—I have spoken to you of
what we term The Eternal Now. I myself have often thought that your
next week is sometimes our today. I have compared notes with others
and find that we agree. I am frequently uncertain whether a thing
happened to you yesterday, or whether it is to happen tomorrow.
" In the case you mention . . . the house and its furniture may have been
seen as a picture of what would presently be. Visions of the future have
undoubtedly been seen and described with extraordinary detail. Another
possibility is that the power of thought happened to be focussed by
conscious or unconscious desire ; the man may have wished for a house of
that kind. The power of thought is indeed strong ; it may have raised
him to a state in which he could visualise and describe it. There is such a
thing as projection of vision, or, let us say, a stray beam penetrates the
window or wall of time. It would not be well for it to operate often, but it
is permitted occasionally to show that it can be done."
That it is sometimes done seems evident from the facts of precognitive
clairvoyance.
Had our communicators said that they obtained information about a
future event from people on higher spheres than their own, that would
have but removed the problem a step further away and left it still unsolved.
What they do say, however, is that they themselves can sometimes
become aware of the future event without knowing how this awareness
comes to them. This can be paralleled with our own experience.
For we are constantly aware of facts without being able to understand
how the awareness arises in consciousness. I am not alluding to rare and
dramatic occasions, called supernormal. I am thinking of the thousands
of instances which occur daily : for when we see, hear, feel with hands,
taste or smell, the same thing happens! We are mostly oblivious to the
wonder of this ; for having been accustomed to it from childhood we fail
175] Forecasts and Precognition 327
to notice the inexplicable in that which inevitably, regularly and constantly
happens.
Our sense organs, eye, ear, etc., serve to bring nerve impulses to the
brain. That is well understood ; for the nerves can be dissected and their
rate of impulse-passage measured. But why should impulses which reach
the brain produce in us an awareness of what takes place around us?
We know that they do this, but we are unaware how. Between brain and
personal consciousness there is a mysterious process which has not, so
far, been grasped by man's efforts to understand it.
And so, like our communicators, we know without knowing how we
know.
In foretelling a future event, communicators sometimes remark that
they " feel strongly " that it will happen—for example, the Eastwood
Forecast, and the reference to property and Ramsgate in the Garage
Proprietor case. Such foretellings are a manifestation of the basic fact of
awareness, and only strike us as strange because they are less common
than other forms of it which occur with us in daily consciousness. While
communicators occasionally become aware of events in the near future,
we are continually becoming aware of things in the near vicinity, and this
awareness (via the senses) is a mystery too.
To those who believe that life beyond death affords unlimited scope
for progressive development, it is reasonable to think that some at least
of those who passed on thousands of years ago will have attained knowledge
and powers of mind far beyond imagination to conceive. On earth there
are yet remote and backward tribes whose members, not having conversed
with travellers and explorers, would be completely unable to realise the
methods by which some of our everyday actions are accomplished. And,
though the learner might be eager and his teachers expert, it would be
impossible to make him understand how we travel by train, talk by
telephone, reproduce by gramophone, or hear and see by radio, unless
and until a number of mechanical and electrical operations had first been
made clear to him. To a man whose most lethal weapon was the poisoned
dart, the construction and action of atomic bombs would be inconceivable.
Our knowledge of these things has come through the labours and
inventiveness of generations. Each stage gained made further stages
possible. Some events were more epoch-making than others ; the
production and use of fire, of explosives, of steam and electricity, marked
epochs in human progress ; as also in the mental progress of mankind did
the alphabet, numerals and printing.
In my many years of intercourse with friends in the Beyond it has
become abundantly clear that they have not remained stationary in mental
power, but that activity of thought and acquisition of knowledge have been
accelerated. When one considers the change in outlook and power of
apprehension which the few years between adolescence and advanced
maturity have brought us, it can be better imagined what progress is being
enjoyed by those who passed centuries ago and whose activities are not
checked by the need of spending one-third of their time in sleep. May
we not liken them to the travellers and explorers who know so much more
than they can explain to remote and backward tribesmen in whose
position, relative to the former, we find ourselves? Until we have grasped
328 C. Drayton Thomas [Part
certain elusive truths, we are precluded from grasping others yet more
difficult. Among the latter may be the nature of time.
Consider the implications of the following conversation which foUovved
my reporting the success of the Eastwood Sisters forecast and for which
I invited explanation :
Feda : Your father says that Etta, owing to her deep interest in
matters psychical when on earth, has more ability than many in
estimating, from what she feels or knows, what will come to pass.
C. D. T. : But surely it is impossible to estimate without some facts
on which to build? In this case there was no plan in anyone's mind.
Feda : He doesn't know how to explain through Feda what he means
and would wish to say. But he thinks people like Etta, who develop
their psychic gifts before and after passing, can to some extent make a
better use of their understanding about Time. When she gave you the
prediction there was apparently no foundation for it.
C. D. T. : None whatever.
Feda : Look, he is going like this ;
Etta—a line there A and one
there B. She anticipated B, ahhough she was at the point A.
C. D. T. : Yes, that is clear.
Feda: On your plane of perception, unless in some exceptionally
psychic state, you would have to stay at your own point in time. Etta
has a better, shall I say, observation post than yours.
C. D. T. : Admitted ; but she cannot see what does not exist!
Feda : But it does exist! And that is just what I cannot explain.
C. D. T. : Then your statement is that there was a sense in which
the event had already taken place and Etta was able to view its happen-
ing, although in earthly time— . , , , r ,
Feda : In earthly time it had not materialised. It had not manifested
itself in your conditions, in your dimension.
Our mental powers have been evolved in a struggle for physical needs
and seem at present incapable of grasping adequately such facts as endless
space time without beginning or termination, or even the modus operandi
of our memory and perception. It may be that an understanding of
precognition will be less difficult than the foregoing. Yet it is sufficiently
difficuh to baffle our present mental powers.
Man is able to see for a certain distance around him ;
optical instruments
can give him more far-reaching views. But the deepest plumbing into
space by the most efficient of his instruments fails to find any indication
of finality
•
there is yet more to be seen beyond the furthest limits of
vision And so it is with mental probings also ;
for man finds himself
surrounded by a mental haze into which he probes in vain. It is true that
he sees the immediate concrete earth, also the social life around him. But
what a restricted gaze! If he would view the life and conditions of his
great-grandparent's time he must depend on a few old letters, certain
books and historical records which convey to him little of the viyid life
which those departed relatives knew. Still more is he fogged when he
desires to see how the successive strata of the earth beneath his feet were
laid or the actual condition of the earth's central core. Imagination,
aided by scraps of inference, is his only probe in this, as in many other
175] Forecasts and Precognition 329
directions also. In whichever direction he looks this impenetrable haze
baffles him. The majority of his fellows therefore elect to take life as it
comes, assessing things at their surface value and leaving to scientists and
philosophers the inferential delving into that which does not seem to
immediately concern either our necessities or our pleasure.
What wonder, then, that they accept Time in like manner and have no
suspicion of the mystery at which instances of precognition hint? Men
with spiritual experience rest satisfied that, as they step firmly forward in
the path of duty, a further length of that path will be made clear, step by
step, by the Providence which has shaped the pathway hitherto. For to
such men the Guided Life is a most real fact.
In addition to the collected cases of Myers, Richet and Osty, instances
of foreknowledge and prediction, gathered from S.P.R. Proceedings and
elsewhere, will be found in the following more recent books :

' ~ LORD RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.
Robert John Strutt, Lord Rayleigh, was a member of the family in
which interest in psychical research dated back beyond the formation of the
Society for Psychical Research, and was closely associated with distinction
in physical science. His father was one of the group of Cambridge scientists
with whom Sidgwick, Gurney and Myers were closely allied, and his mother
was a Miss Balfour and shared to the full the manifold intellectual interests
characteristic of that family. Lord Rayleigh joined the Society in 1925
and was President for the years 1937-1938. He was a man of very many
activities, not only in the field of pure science but in the application of
scientific methods to the management of large agricultural estates.
Of his work in physics Dr A. J. C. Wilson of University College, Cardifl^,
writes as follows :
-
Lord Rayleigh as a Physicist
" Among the younger generation of scientists Lord Rayleigh's achieve-
ment as a physicist hardly receives the recognition it deserves. There are
probably two complementary reasons for this ; his reputation is over-
shadowed by that of his great father, and his early election to the Royal
Society and similar honours are attributed to his inherited position rather
than to his ability. In truth however his own work in experimental physics
and his long record of public service amply justify the many honours he
received.
His early interest was radioactivity, and he published numerous papers
in this field, typical subjects being Distribution of Radium in the Earth's
Crust, Helium and Argon in Common Rocks, Direct Estimate of the
Minimum Age of Thorianite, and Accumulation of Helium in Geological
Time. His work on the distribution of helium in various rocks led to an
estimate of the " age " of the earth, that is, of the time during which the
earth has existed as a solid body. Among his other contributions to the
main line of advance of physics were studies of line spectra and of active
nitrogen. The work on line spectra was carried out in collaboration with the
late Professor A. Fowler, and was important in the latter's interpretation
of line spectra and in the development of the quantum theory.
Lord Rayleigh's independent position and private laboratory at Terling
made it possible for him to explore some of the fascinating by-ways of
science, closed to the industrial physicist, and fast closing to the academic
physicist in a world of planning. Among these may be classed his work
on the colours of beetles' wings and on the ultimate shape of pebbles.
His interest in minerals, early shown in his studies of radioactivity, was
maintained to the end of his life, one of his last papers being on an attempt
to imitate the structure of the type of stony meteorites called pallasites.
Besides his strictly scientific work he published biographies of his
father and Sir J. J. Thomson.
It would be improper not to mention Lord Rayleigh's activities as
Chairman of the Civil Research Committee on Radium Requirements,
330
[Part 175] Obituary 331
Chairman of the Governing Body, Imperial College of Science, President of
the British Association, and chairman or member of many other boards and
committees, though details hardly fall within the scope of this note. It is in
this field of public service to science that his loss will be most widely felt."
His other activities afforded him little leisure to devote to active psychical
research, but he maintained a very keen interest in the Society, which he
showed both by contributing papers to the Proceedings and by his share in
the administrative work of the Society, and shortly before his death by a
very generous donation. Besides his Presidential Address he described
in Vol. XLI of Proceedings " A Method of Silhouette Photography by
Infra-red Rays for use in Mediumistic Investigation ", as to which
Dr A. J. B. Robertson writes as follows :
" Rayleigh in 1932 described a method of silhouette photography by
infra-red rays for use in the investigations of physical mediums. At that
time the available infra-red plates were not of sufficient sensitivity to
enable a short period photograph to be taken without the introduction of a
certain amount of visible light. Rayleigh pointed out that the difficulty
could be overcome by photographing only a silhouette of the structures
which might be produced, such as cheesecloth, or the psychical substance
found by E. and M. Osty to be apparently produced by the medium
R. Schneider and to be capable of absorption of infra-red rays. With
Rayleigh's method practically the whole of the infra-red beam can be
caused to enter the camera and contribute to the image formation. The
method, however, gives only the outlines of a uniformly opaque object.
Rayleigh used a double convex field lens of large aperture to focus the
radiation on the camera lens, which was focussed on the region in front of
the field lens or on the field lens. Obstructions of the infra-red beam could
be detected with a photo-electric cell.
Rayleigh's apparatus was used by Lord Charles Hope and Mr C. V. C.
Herbert in the investigation of R. Schneider. Although some absorption
of the radiation was observed nothing definite could be seen on the plates ;
this may have been due to the supposed psychic substance absorbing only
rays of a wavelength too long to be registered on the photographic plate.
Rayleigh, however, pointed out that his method was not very suitable for
the detailed study of ray absorption, the photo-electric cell being liable
to accidental disturbance."
In another paper he recorded some most interesting reminiscences of
our first President, Henry Sidgwick, who was his uncle by marriage.
It happened that during his presidency the Society's claim for exemption
from income tax came before the Special Commissioners. At the hearing
Lord Rayleigh made a most powerful declaration as to the scientific status
of the Society and the importance of its researches, which produced a
profound impression and placed the issue beyond any doubt.
On the outbreak of war in 1939, when there was great anxiety as to the
safe preservation of the Society's important archives and records against
any risk of destruction through enemy action, Lord Rayleigh very kindly
consented to store the documents (about a dozen large packing cases) at
his country house, Terling Place, Essex, where they remained in safety
*'
for the duration ".
332 Obituary [part 175'
Dr N. M. Butler
The death of Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Columbia University,
carries our thoughts back to the very beginnings of psychical research.
For he, in collaboration with several other American scholars led by
William James, helped in the organisation of the first American Society for
Psychical Research, and as a corresponding member of the S.P.R. retained
his affiliation with these lines of investigation until his death.
Trained as a philosopher and also as a lawyer, Dr Butler was early
drawn into a life of administrative activities. It was he who, as Chairman
of the Department of Philosophy at Columbia University, brought experi-
mental psychology to that institution in the person of James McKeen
Cattell ; he who, a few years later, grasped the vision of a central teachers'
training institution and gave Teachers' College, Columbia University, its
primary impetus ; he who, as editor of an educational journal, crossed
swords with the reactionaries at the turn of the century. Columbia
University grew at an accelerated tempo during the opening decades of
this century, largely as a result of his grasp of the ways in which its under-
graduate and graduate schools might integrate existing local educational
institutions and might serve the needs of a metropolitan community. He
was always active in politics and deeply concerned with problems of inter-
national relations, upon which he constantly wrote and spoke. It was
partly through him that funds left by Andrew Carnegie in the interest of
world peace were expended for the benefit of education in international
affairs. His knowledge of the legal and political history of Great Britain
and the United States was drawn upon in the deliberations which followed
World War I, and his advice continued to receive deep deference during
the succeeding years. He was, in short, among the band of distinguished
scholars who, despite their key position in public affairs, have not held
themselves aloof from the still inadequately recognised domain of psychical
research.

OBITUARY
The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E.
In the many spheres of public Hfe in which she was interested—pohtics,
social reform, the League of Nations, the English-speaking Union, the
project for a National Theatre—Dame Edith Lyttelton found opportunities
for the exercise of exceptional gifts of sympathy, practical good sense and a
keen, but kindly judgment of persons and affairs. The same qualities made
her a most valuable member of the S.P.R., which she joined in 1902, and
an influential member of the Council, to which she was appointed in 1928.
At the beginning of her Presidential Address in 1933 she said :
" I have no claim or right to be in this position. I have had no scienti-
fic training. I am neither a psychologist nor a metaphysician nor a
philosopher ".
Theory was not indeed her strong point, and to that extent we may agree
with her modest disclaimer. But sympathetic insight into human prob-
lems, wide reading and, above all, long exercise of psychic faculties, taken
together, constitute no mean qualification for high office in our Society.
Mrs Lyttelton began producing " scripts " in 191 3, shortly after the
death of her husband, Alfred Lyttelton, her " scripts " being mostly
records of inspirational speech. They were first made known to the
Society by Mr Piddington's paper in Proceedings Vol. XXIX, in which she
is called " Mrs King ". The real name was, however, made public in Mr
Piddington's paper in Proceedings Vol. XXXIII (pp. 438-605), in which he
pointed out that her scripts were closely connected by verbal links, which
he explained in detail, with the scripts of other members of " the S.P.R.
group of automatists " which she had not seen. If all these scripts were
put together in accordance with the links between them, it was found that
there were persistent predictions of the War of 19 14 dating back to a time
well before any general apprehension had arisen of a serious risk of war
between Britain and Germany. It would not have been surprising if Mrs
Lyttelton, with her knowledge of public affairs, had in 1913 consciously
recognised the risk of war as appreciable. The interesting point, psycho-
logically, is that she did not at the time interpret her scripts as foretelling
war, though to any other person that would have seemed the obvious mean-
ing, and, psychically, that her scripts dovetailed so remarkably with the
scripts of the other automatists.
Y 333
334 The Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E. [Part
This aspect of the case did not attract so much attention as a single
incident in her scripts, the apparent prediction, made in two scripts of
February and May 1914, of the sinking of the Lusitania in May 1915, an
event the effect of which on international relations has been exceedingly
far-reaching. The prediction was not exactly fulfilled in all details, and the
possibility of its having been a fluke cannot be disregarded. Before, how-
ever, adopting that view, the reader would do well to consider not only Mr
Piddington's comments {Proceedings Yo\. XXXIII, pp. 499, 500, 599-603),
but also what Mrs Richmond says below as to some other, unpublished,
predictions in Mrs Lyttelton's scripts.
Not unnaturally the problem of precognition was constantly in her mind.
This was the subject on which she spoke in the series of B.B.C. talks in
1934. Out of a large number of cases then reported to her by listeners she
made an interesting selection published as Sotne Cases of Prediction (1938).
Myers's description of the subliminal as part rubbish-heap and part
treasure-house is familiar. Between the wars popular interest in psycho-
logical developments was concentrated on the former aspect. Mrs
Lyttelton's book Our Superconscious Mind (1931) was a useful corrective
of this one-sided view. Even more persuasive, however, was her own life-
work in which the distinguished conduct of public affairs was harmoniously
combined with the exercise of faculties that uninstructed opinion often
regards as queer and unworthy of serious study.
W. H. S.
Mrs Richmond, who came to know Mrs Lyttelton well through a
common interest in psychical research, writes as follows :
The national, social and literary activities of Mrs Lyttelton were
enumerated in The Times and other papers when she died on September
the ist, and they all put her interest in Psychical Research last on the list.
Still, it was mentioned and this is some advance.
Really Psychical Research and what she called the life of the soul came
first and foremost in her mind, and all her other activities flowed from her
great desire to help people towards a diflferent outlook in the light of a real
belief in Eternity. When she was young, this interest was submerged by
the more ordinary things of life, in which she was always intensely in-
terested, and during the time of her great social success her psychic gifts
were manifested in her insight into character and her extraordinary
sympathy for those she felt akin to, and also in her writings.
She wrote several plays in which Mrs Patrick Campbell, a great friend
of hers, acted and she did not hesitate to deal with subjects not then very
popular with playwrights, such as sweated labour, which is the theme of
The Thumbscrew and St Ursula. This last shows more signs of her interest
in dreams and communications of a transcendental order. It was the death
of her infant son that first made her fully conscious of a conflict in herself,
about what she really believed. The religion in which she had been
brought up failed to help her, and a psychological struggle ensued that
only sensitive people suffer from.
But this conflict prepared her for the blow of her husband's death in
176] Obituary 335
1913 and it was then that she started the " automatic writing " which, in
time, showed such precognitive quahties.
The scripts that could be understood at the time are pubHshed in
Proceedings Vol. XXXIII, March 1923, by J. G. Piddington. But several
very interesting points in the scripts were quite incomprehensible at that
time. For instance on May 24th 1915 she wrote, " The hand stretched
out to stay Berchtesgaden ", and on Jan. 31st 1915, four months before the
above, come these words,
" The nemesis of Fate nearer and nearer, no respite now, nearer much
than you think and once it begins there is no stay—no one knows . . . The
Munich bond remember that. You will see strange things ". Even when
victory was won in 19 18 no sense could be made of these two scripts ;
they
referred to happenings twenty years later.
It was not till 1922 that I met Mrs Lyttelton. My husband had been
doing automatic writing in connection with the S.P.R. group for a few
years, but we had no idea who the other writers were.
1
At that time we needed a country house, and a firm of agents arranged
an appointment for me to see Mrs Lyttelton, who had one to let. I can
never remember how we got onto the subject of Psychical Research
within the first few minutes of that interview, but we did. The house
became quite a secondary consideration and our friendship began from
that moment. We took the house, and soon started having sittings
together in it, when Mrs Lyttelton and her daughter. Lady Craik, invited
us, as they often did for weekends.
Sometimes all four of us wrote or spoke in turn. Sometimes, more
rarely, Mrs Lyttelton and my husband had a sort of duet, while Lady
Craik and I took down what they said. Very often just Mrs Lyttelton
and I would sit together and this continued periodically till a short time
before she died.
The content of these messages proved extremely helpful and instructive
i
to all of us, and they set up a curious and valuable state of telepathic
I
rapport that seemed, and still seems outside time. It is not possible to
I
describe this, or the various levels that our messages revealed, rapidly
I
changing sometimes from trivial to profound themes, or keeping up a
humorous conversation full of insight and good advice, and sometimes
strafing us for our lack of persistence in our good resolves.
I
They were definitely an educative process and an adventure together.
The messages for " the S.P.R. Group " were of quite a different tone to
I the rest, and we hardly ever understood what they meant. But we all felt
: reassured and encouraged if they were approved of by Mr Piddington,
I remember Mrs Lyttelton completely rewrote her book Our Super-

THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF " DISPERSED HITS "
IN CARD-GUESSING EXPERIMENTS
By M. S. Bartlett
A FEW years ago an informative summary account of card-guessing ex-
periments on telepathy, especially of those carried out by S. G. Soal, was
published by C. D. Broad^ ;
reading this account recently, I found it a
very useful introduction to the comprehensive report^ by S. G. Soal and i
K. M. Goldney of their series of experiments in precognitive telepathy.
'
However, as the significant results which emerged mainly arose not with
o (direct) hits, but with + i (precognitive) and - i (postcognitive) hits,
and as some of the statistical tests described by Broad were concerned with
the significance of simultaneous + i and/or - i, or + i, o and - i hits, it
seems advisable to note that these last tests on what might be termed " dis-
persed hits " are not necessarily valid, and require further examination.
In a test for o hits, with 25 cards of 5 types, the mean number of hits
obtained by chance is correctly stated as 5N, where N is the total number
of sets of 25 guesses, and the variance (standard deviation squared) as 4N ;
(approximately). But in a joint test of o, +1 and - i hits, while the mean i
number of hits is certainly 73N/5, the variance is not necessarily, even
4N
approximately, 73 x —,
independently of the guessing pattern of the subject.
The effect of non-random guessing patterns (in the absence of genuine
telepathy) is always one to be watched for. For example, it is known that
if an experiment were conducted simultaneously on several percipients,
these could not be assumed necessarily to give uncorrelated answers ;
again, in an earlier article'' in these Proceedings, W. L. Stevens drew
attention to the effect of a predilection on the part of the subject to a parti-
cular topic on the original analysis made by Whately Carington of a series
of drawing experiments. In the present instance I am not aware that the
effect (which only arises when more than one type of hit is considered
simultaneously) has previously been pointed out, though qualitatively it
can be made apparent by considering extreme cases. Thus if I knew that
scores were to be judged on +1,0 and - i hits simultaneously, and were
asked to be a subject, I would deliberately choose, if I wanted to be
cunning, a guessing pattern where runs of the same type of card occurred,
for then I should be likely to score heavily (on +1,0 and - i hits simul-.
taneously) if I scored at all, whereas on an alternating guessing pattern I
should be either right on o hits and hence wrong on + i and - i hits, or if
right on + I and/or - i hits, wrong on o hits, and therefore less likely to
make a big score by chance. |
The effect does not introduce actual bias, as I should be just as likely
'
to get low scores as high ones, but it alters the variance and hence the
appropriate significance test. This difficulty is of course avoided if tests
on such simultaneous hits are not used ; for example, if a percipient were
found from preliminary trials to score mainly on + i hits, it would be :
'^Philosophy, 19 (1944), 261. '^Proceedings, Part 167, 21. ^Pt. 163, 256.
336
[Part 176] Statistical Significance of " Dispersed Hits "
337
reasonable in a further series of experiments to concentrate on the signi-
ficance of such + I hits. But, at least in the case when the actual order of
the cards is entirely random (for example, where there is no restriction to
5 cards of each of the 5 types in each set of 25), it is not impossible to work
out the appropriate variance for the total score on more than one type of
hit, appropriate to any observed guessing pattern. The method is given
below for reference.
Scoring fo}- -1,0 and + i hits.
When a total score receives a contribution from each guessed card on - i,
o and + I hits with the actual cards, it is easy to see that the same total
score is obtained if we count the number of -1,0 and + i hits of each
actual card with the series of guessed cards. Since the actual cards are
assumed to occur at random, the variance of the total score is the sum of
the variances of the scores from each actual card. Such scoring depends
on the pattern of the three relevant guessed cards. These patterns may
be grouped as shown in the Table (A, B, C being any three different types
out of the five), where the corresponding contributions to the variance are
given.

Examples :
(i) Guessing pattern consisting of 25 cards of one type. This gives
two patterns (la) and twenty-three of (1), so that the variance is
2 X 16 + 23 X 36 860
—— = = 34-4
25 25
(This result agrees with a value worked out by Soal and communicated
to me in the course of correspondence.)
(ii) Guessing pattern consisting of 5 cards of one type, followed
similarly by 5 cards of each other type. This gives two patterns (la),
fifteen of (i) and eight of (2). Hence the variance is
2x16 + 15x36 + 8x16 700 _
= = 2o-o
25 25
338 Professor M. S. Bartlett [Part 176]
(iii) Guessing pattern consisting of one card of each type, repeated
five times. This gives two patterns (ib), and twenty-three of (3).
Hence the variance is
2x6 + 2"? x6,
=6-o
25
Similar methods could obviously be worked out for other scoring
systems, e.g. - i and + i hits only, or -2, - i, o, +1, +2 hits.
Multiply-detertnined hits.
The above discussion is also relevant to the discussion of what are
termed " multiply-determined " guesses, that is, where the actual cards
corresponding to + i precognition and - i postcognition are of the same
type (see Appendix B of the report referred to). Unfortunately once we
choose to consider the actual cards according to such a classification, we
are in effect sorting them out into non-random groups, so that, as in the
case where the actual order is restricted to give 5 cards of each type in
every set of 25, the relation between the actual cards and the guessed cards
becomes rather complicated, for both sets may not be entirely random.
However, it is sufficient to note that the sorting of the actual sets into
multiply-determined and non-multiply-determined hits creates a pattern
for the actual cards, so that, whether or not the guessing pattern is random,
the variance for such hits will be affected. This can be seen by a considera-
tion of a hypothetical set of cards with two types only ; it is then impossible
not to get a + i or a - i hit if the guess is not multiply-determined, since
if I guess A and this is wrong for the back-hit, it will score for the fore-hit.
The methods of the previous section may be used to obtain the appropriate
variance (in the absence of genuine cognition), if the guessing pattern is
random, working this time on the series of guessed cards as the random
series and on the pattern of the actual cards according to whether or not
they have been classified as providing multiply-determined guesses. We
obtain for the variance contribution to the total score of + i and - i hits
from each guess for which + i and - i hits are possible :

As a check, the chance of a multiply-determined guess is \, and

the correct variance for random guesses and random actual cards.
It follows that a simple test of deviations from expectation will not be
based on the correct variance in this particular case, and hence will not
necessarily be valid for the purpose used in Appendix B.
REPLY TO PROFESSOR BARTLETT
By S. G. Soal
I SHOULD first point out that Professor Bartlett's main criticism does not
apply to the report on Precognitive Telepathy published by Mrs Goldney
and myself in 1943. He rightly contends that if ( + i) (o) and (
- i) guesses
are pooled the correct theoretical variance is not given by the binomial
formula 73 x 4N/25 but depends on the guessing patterns employed by the
percipient. But in the main experiments with Shackleton the above
method was not used but the ( + i ) scores were estimated separately and
found to yield a significant positive deviation which on a conservative
estimate gave odds of the order of lo^s to i against such a deviation being
the work of chance. Professor Bartlett, I understand, would not seriously
challenge the statistical validity of this result. His criticism however does
apply to the method of pooling used in estimating the results of the experi-
ments with Mrs Stewart and Mr Shackleton in 1936 [" Fresh Light on
Card-Guessing ; some new effects " Proceedings, S.P.R. Vol. 46, pp. 152-
198]. It remains therefore to ascertain whether or not the significance of
these preliminary experiments was over-estimated.
There are in all 112 sets of 25 (2800 trials) of which 80 sets were pro-
duced by Mrs Stewart and the remaining 32 by Mr Shackleton. The
observed standard deviation for the 112 sets is found to be 47-9 as com-
pared with the value
^ =36-17 actually used in estimating the
significance of the pooled ( + i) (o), (
- i) guesses. We may first note that
if we use the observed standard deviation (47-9) instead of 36-17 we still
obtain a highly significant result.
We have
Total number of (o, +1, - i) trials =8176
Expected number of hits =1635-2
Actual number of (o, +1, - i) hits = 1900-0
Deviation = 264-8
Observed standard deviation = 47-9
Critical Ratio = 5-52
Making allowance for the fact that this set of 2800 trials was chosen from
a total of 128,350 trials by various persons we arrive at the approximation
P = 2-7 X 10-''. Even so the 1936 results are seen to very significant. The
high value of the observed variance is due to the fact that there is a con-
siderable amount of paranormal cognition and is only to be expected.
A fairer method is to work out the expected variance by means of the
very useful scheme worked out by Professor Bartlett. It is a simple matter
to count the numbers of guesses of the types AAA, AAB, etc., and to
estimate the contributions to the variance arising from the diff"erent types.
I have done this both for Mrs Stewart and for Mr Shackleton.
The results are given in tables I and II on the next page.

Totals 2000 872-00 2000 934-400
Under A is given the actual number of guesses of each of the five
categories and under Va is the corresponding contribution to the theo-
retical variance. Under E is given the expected number for each category
if the subjects' guesses were a random series and under Ve the correspond-
ing variance. The total of the Ve column (934-400) should be — x 80 x 73
25
which is true.
It is seen that the correct value of the theoretical standard deviation is
v/872-00 = 29-5 which is slightly less than V934-400 = 30-6.
Hence we are on the safe side in using the formula
^ x 80 x 73 in
estimating significance of pooled (o, +1, - i) guesses.
An inspection of Table I shows that the difference between these two
values is largely accounted for by the unwillingness of the guesser to repeat
the same symbol three or more times in succession. This tendency which
is to be observed in the majority of subjects generally results in a lowering
of the theoretical variance owing to the comparatively high contribution
made by the group AAA to the total variance. On the other hand a guesser
who deliberately (or otherwise) makes frequent runs of the AAA type will
tend to create a variance which is very much higher than — x N x 73.
25
It is therefore safest to use the method of Professor Bartlett.

AB 54 12-96 51-20 12-2280
Totals 800 335*2o 8oo-oo 373-7000
We again find in the case of Shackleton that the correct value of the
standard deviation = ^335-20 = 18-3 which is less than ^373-7= 19-3.
176] Reply to Professor Bartlett 341
Our conclusion is that neither in the case of Mrs Stewart nor in that of
Shackleton was there any overestimation of the significance of the results
obtained in the 1936 experiments.
Multiple Determination
The problem of the " multiply-determined " guesses is a much thornier
one than I had originally supposed. There does not appear to be any
simple method that is valid for finding the theoretical variance since the
subjects' guesses will never constitute a random series. Professor Bartlett
has given the variance in the case where both the guess and the presenta-
tion series are random but additional complications will occur owing to the
presence of true cognitions.
Taking as a very rough estimate the variance to be J|N where N is the
number of guesses for which both ± i hits are both possible and using the
expectations given on p. 136 Appendix B {Proceedings Part 167) under
hypothesis (a) I find X = 27 for the 1936 work and X = 2-6 for Shackleton's
work with the agent J.Ai. Neither of these results is sufficiently striking
to permit of much faith in the possibility that there is anything in this
business of multiple determination. We must therefore regretfully
abandon the conclusions of Appendix B, but there seems no cause to doubt
the main result of the 1936 experiments.
ADDITIONAL NOTE ON A TEST OF SURVIVAL
By Robert H. Thouless
The first cipher passage given on p. 253 of my article on " A Test of Sur-
vival " is no longer of any value for the test, the key word having been
discovered. The second passage on p. 258 remains as a test of my survival.
I propose also to add a third passage which (like the second) is enciphered
by a method too complex for breaking.
My first passage was enciphered by the Playfair system. By spending
on it his spare time for a fortnight a cipher expert discovered the key-word,
which was SURPRISE. I am grateful to him for the trouble he took over
the matter. The moral which must be drawn for the purpose of tests of
survival is that unbreakability must be ensured by a complex method of
encipherment ; it is not sufficient that the message should be a short one.
The cipher expert suggested another method of encipherment which he
said would be, in practice, unbreakable, and which would also be simpler
to construct than the method I employed for passage II. I add, therefore,
a third passage enciphered by the method he suggested : BTYRR OOFLH
KCDXK FWPCZ KTADR GFHKA HTYXO ALZUP PYPVF
AYMMF SDLR UVUB. This is a meaningful passage (not a quotation)
which has been enciphered by a method which I will explain, involving
two key words. The giving of these two key words will be the proof I hope
to give of survival after my bodily death.
The method of encipherment is as follows. The original passage is
enciphered by the Playfair system using the first of the key words.^ A
single letter chosen at random is then put at the beginning and end of the
enciphered passage and it is enciphered again by the Playfair system using
the second key word. The introduction of the additional letter at the
beginning and end is simply to throw the letter pairs out of step with
one another in the two encipherments.
I will illustrate the method with the passage " Balm of hurt minds ".
Let us suppose the two key words are " psychical " and " research ".
The two Playfair letter squares will be :
I II
PSYCH RESAC
lALBD HBDFG
EFGKM IKLMN
N O Q R T O P Q T U
UVWXZ VWXYZ
The passage is first enciphered by the first letter square :
Original BA LM OF HU RT MI ND SX
ist encipherment DL DG VO PZ TN ED TI CV
' The method of using the Playfair system can be found in most books on ciphers
or in the Encyclopaedia Britannica article on " Codes and Ciphers " (vol. V p. 957).
342
[Part 176] Additional Note on a Test of Survival 343
ist encipherment (re-paired) PD LD GV OP ZT NE DT IC VP
and encipherment QB QL HZ PQ YU KC FQ NR WO
And, written in blocks of five, the passage becomes : QBQLH ZPQYU
KCFQ NRWO.
The second encipherment requires one modification of the standard
Playfair method. Normally, any letter pair containing the same letter
twice repeated, is broken up by the interpolation of an X between the two.
This method will not do for the second encipherment because : (i) after
the interpolation, the pairing of the two encipherments would no longer
be out of step, and (ii) decipherment would be made difficult by the
absence of any indication of which letter was an added one. The difficulty
can be overcome by breaking up any such letter pair for the second
encipherment by the interpolation of another double letter, not necessarily
" XX ". For example, suppose the first encipherment gave the letter
pairs : DN RA AL TP. These would be re-paired as .D NR AA L..
Let us now insert a double C between the two As : .D NR AC CA L..
The letter pairs now remain out of step after the interpolation. There is
no difficulty in deciphering since it will be apparent that the CC must be
dropped out for the second decipherment since no pair that is not inter-
polated could possibly have the second letter the same as the first.
To sum up. Passage I is now withdrawn from my test of survival since
it has proved not to be unbreakable by rational means. Passage II remains
as part of the test ; its key is a continuous passage. Passage III is now
added to replace passage I. Its key is two words. The method of en-
cipherment of passages II and III have both been explained so that all
that is to be communicated is the key in each case. Both passages are
practically unbreakable by rational means and either method is recom-
mended for anyone who wants to repeat the test. The method described
here is less trouble than the other.
ON THE NEED FOR CAUTION IN ASSESSING
MEDIUMISTIC MATERIAL
By Denys Parsons •
•
In the Journal for March-April 1947, (p. 22), a case was contributed by
Mrs G. entitled " Veridical information given by a medium of matters
outside the sitter's knowledge ".^ It described part of a sitting with the
trance medium, Mrs Bedford, in which a communicator described the
circumstances of his death and sent messages.^
On reading this case, my first reaction was to draft a letter to the Editor
arguing that the case was evidentially almost worthless because most of
the statements made by the medium would be found applicable to the
circumstances surrounding many a passing. On second thoughts it
occurred to me that the unsupported statement of my opinion would be
equally worthless ;
accordingly I devised an experiment to test it.
First, it must be recalled that Mrs G.'s case was quite inadequately
annotated. I wrote to Mrs G. asking for the answers to twenty questions
which had been left unanswered by the annotators. From her answers
it was clear that the correspondence of the medium's utterances with the
facts was much more exact than had been apparent from the published
version. The only incorrect or unrecognised items were names and
initials. However, I decided to proceed with the experiment.
I obtained from four ladies, small objects for a normal psychometry
experiment with a professional medium (not Mrs Bedford). When the
readings were received they were typed out on separate sheets and onto
the end of each one was added, without a break, the substance of Mrs
Bedford's trance communication, transcribed practically verbatim from
the Journal account. The typescripts were then sent to the subjects for
annotation. In order to impose as little as possible on the good faith of
these ladies who so kindly co-operated, I took care to explain that some
fictitious items had been mixed in with the genuine reading as a " control ".
I did not of course explain that all the " fictitious " items were contained
in a long section at the end of the reading.
It was necessary to guard against bias in the selection of subjects. If I
had chosen four ladies myself, it might be said that I had selected those
whom I considered might have histories similar to that of Mrs G.'s friend.
But Mrs G., though not a Spiritualist, has regular sittings with mediums.
It seemed reasonable to select subjects who might also be accustomed to
do so. Miss Mercy Phillimore, Secretary of the London Spiritualist
Alliance, was kind enough to approach four ladies on my behalf. The
only stipulation I made was that they should be over forty years of age.
Miss Phillimore was unaware of the nature of the experiment.
^ The case was also published in Light, April, 1947. Mrs G. has kindly shown
me her notes of the whole sitting which was about twice the length of the published
excerpt. The unpublished portion contained much material applicable to Mrs. G.,
though, in my opinion, its evidential value is lessened by the fact that it was not
proxy material, as was the published section, and that it was not a first sitting.
However the question whether or not the unpublished part of the sitting was
veridical is irrelevant to the present investigation.
344
[Part 176] Caution in Assessing Mediumistic Material 345
The Results. The results gave confirmation of my forecast, the accuracy
of which surprised me. The four ladies are designated Miss A., Mrs Z.,
Mrs C. and Miss D. The readings of Mrs C. and Miss D. were poor
as a whole and completely negative for the section relevant to this experi-
ment. The readings of Miss A. and Mrs Z. were poor except for the
spurious added passage which elicited the most striking annotations. These
are printed on pages 346-351 in parallel columns for comparison.
Miss A.'s annotations, with the exception of items 9 and 16, fit perfectly.^
In one respect the fit is even better than the original ; Mrs G.'s friend
could not recognise item 17 which gave the names Arthur, Charles, and
Harold, and three initials. The name Arthur is particularly appropriate
to Miss A., and so are two of the initials. The correspondence in item 15
concerning the numbers 4 and 2, is very weak, but in Mrs G.'s case it is
little better, as the digits have to be reversed to make sense. The name
" Jack " in item 15, I learnt afterwards, was a pseudonym, so Miss A.'s
annotation here is irrelevant, but helps to show that almost any common
name can be fitted in somewhere. " Jack's " real name, though, an
equally common one, had no associations for her in this context. Mrs
Bedford gave one additional fact to Mrs. G. about " Jack " which could
not be published.
In the Journal for December 1947 Mrs G. contributed another instal-
ment to the case, obtained through her own automatic writing :
" No
need for more tests, but keys is one. Remind her of keys to do with
holiday." This incident was added to the typescripts and was recognised as
applicable by Miss A. (item 18).
Mrs. Z. knew two families to whom many of the statements could be
applied, some to one and some to the other. The correspondence is much
less good, and there seemed little point in asking Mrs Z. to re-annotate
the reading for the two families separately.
^ I was concerned lest Miss A. should be upset when she heard that this section
of the reading was fictitious. However, she was gracious enough to write :
" I
quite understand that it was a planned experiment, and my mother and I are not
at all upset to know how it was worked."

Given a different partner he might

as it was, being very sensitive, he

Yes, my mother has been w orried
about increasing expenses. The
most valuable things are probably
the rings my father gave her, to
which she is so much attached
sentimentally that nothing would
induce her to part with them, nor
does it appear necessary.
Owing to troubles over repairs
and three burglaries, my mother
has been considering whether it
would not be best to dispose of the
house.
This paragraph is true. My

Discussion.
The experiment shows the need for caution in assessing mediumistic
material. We have here a lengthy and detailed statement which, if taken
at its face value, provides evidence of paranormal cognition, if not of
survival. It is all the more impressive in that it was virtually a proxy
sitting ; most of the items were unknown to Mrs G. at the time. The
same statement is circulated to four other persons only. Two of them
accept it as applicable to their own circumstances, one of whom confirms
almost every detail.
I do not wish anything I say to be construed as reflecting on the sincerity
of Mrs Bedford. It is reasonable to suppose that all professional mediums,
of varying degrees of psychic ability, unconsciously become familiar with
those items which are most readily accepted by sitters ; when psychic
inspiration fails, or perhaps mixed with genuine items, these " popular
"
items will inevitably issue forth. Statements about things placed in the
coffin, for example, or loss of keys, must be very safe guesses. Other items
appear to be out of the ordinary but are not :
" He had another disease
besides the one he died of." Medical friends tell me that this is far from
uncommon. Some less reputable mediums and clairvoyantes undoubtedly
make conscious use of such a practice to earn their livings. But even with
mediums of the highest quality it is clear that much material may be given
which appears at first sight to be exclusive to the sitter, but of which
the evidential value must be discounted because it is in fact not exclusive.
The discounting done, the ground is a little clearer for a decision whether
or not the mediumistic utterances are of supernormal origin.
AYAHUASCA, PEYOTL, YAGfi
By a. J. C. Wilson
The plants known under the names of ayahuasca, peyotl and yage have
three things in common. When consumed in suitable quantity they evoke
visual hallucinations of astonishing clarity and brilliance of colour, and
usually of a pleasing nature. Secondly, because of this property they are
revered by the Indians of the regions in which they grow, and have a
central place in their religious ceremonies. Thirdly, and this is the reason
for writing of them here, they are supposed to produce clairvoyant, tele-
pathic and precognitive powers in persons consuming them. The use of
peyotl for this purpose in Mexico is mentioned by several early Spanish
writers.^
Dost thou wander about at night, calling upon demons to help thee?
Hast thou drunk peyotl, or given it to others to drink, in order to dis-
cover secrets, or to discover where stolen or lost articles were.' (Nicolas
de Leon, circa 1611.)
If the consultation is about a lost or stolen article or concerning a
woman who has absented herself from her husband, or some similar
thing, here enters the gift of false prophecy, and the divining that has
been pointed out in the preceding treatises ; the divination is made in
one of two ways, either by means of a trance or by drinking peyote or
ololiuhqui [Datura meteloides] or tobacco to attain this end, or com-
manding that another drink it and ordering him to remain under its
spell ; and in all this goes imphcitly hand in hand the pact with the
devil who by means of the said drinks. . . . (Hernando Ruis de Alcaron,
circa 1629.)
[Peyotl] causes those devouring it to be able to foresee and predict
things ;
such, for instance, as whether on the following day the enemy
will make an attack upon them ; or v, hether the weather will continue
favorable ; or to discern who has stolen from them some utensil or
anything else ; and all other things of like nature which the Chichimeca
really believe they have found out. (Francisco Hernandez, circa 1638.)
Similar general statements regarding ayahuasca and yage could be given,
but it is difficuh to find detailed accounts of specific instances. There is
little or no evidence of the property of inducing paranormal powers that
reaches the standard required by the Society for Psychical Research for
printing as evidential. The two or three instances quoted below do no
more than establish a prima facie case for further investigation.
I. Peyotl
Peyotl (peyote, mescal,^ muscale) is a small cactus, Echinocacttis
Williamsii, growing in arid regions of Mexico and the southern United
1
These quotations are taken from La Barre (22), pp. 23-4. (Bold-face numerals
refer to the bibliography on pp. 361-3.)
^ Mescal is properly a species of agave, from which an alcoholic drmk is brewed.
The name has been transferred to a spirit distilled from the drink, then to other
353
354 A.y.C. Wilson [Part
States. Most of the plant is underground ; a carrot with the leaves
removed gives some idea of the size of the cactus and the amount of it visible.
The exposed surface is covered with small rounded knobs, arranged in
fairly definite rows and each crowned by a tuft of white hair, and the
central depression is filled with such tufts. The cactus contains several
alkaloids, chiefly in the portion above ground level, of which mescaline is
responsible for the coloured visions, and lophophorine is decidedly poison-
ous. The use of peyotl when taken by mouth is however quite safe, as
large doses provoke vomiting and thus protect the consumer.
The Indians of Mexico, such as the Tarahumare, send special expedi-
tions lasting some weeks to the regions where it grows, the persons taking
part being subject to severe restrictions, particularly in the matter of food.
The plants are ground with water and the liquid is drunk at an all-night
ceremony, dedicated to the god Hikuli, who is believed to be incarnate in
the plant.
At times the shaman dances, at times his assistants, and women may
dance either separately or simultaneously with the other men partici-
pants. The bare-footed men are wrapped to the chin in white blankets ; ,
the women wear clean skirts and tunics. The clockwise dancing (with
a turn of the body at the shaman's place) consists in a " peculiar quick,
jumping march, with short steps, the dancers moving forward one after
another, on their toes, and making sharp, jerky movements, without,
however, turning round ". The men have deer-hoof sonajas, and the
rasping and singing are continuous save when the shaman politely
excuses himself to the fetish hikuli ; others must also ask permission to
leave the patio. In the intermittent dancing they beat their mouths
with the palm imitating hikuli's talk, or cry " Hikuli vava! (Hikuli over
yonder!) " in shrill falsetto. (22, pp. 34-5).
Such ceremonies were formerly confined to the Indians of Mexico, but
since about 1880 a religion based on peyotl has spread gradually north and
west among the Indians of the United States, and by 1930 had penetrated
into Canada (22, 29, 30, 37). Dancing is absent, the ceremonies are
simpler, and the dried tops of the cacti (" mescal buttons ") are chewed and
swallowed without previous preparation, though " tea " may be brewed
from them for the old or ill. It is perhaps worth while to quote a few
sentences from an appreciation of this religion by two members of the U.S.
Office of Indian AflFairs.
In the center of the room a sickle or moon-shaped altar is built of
earth or other material, its open arms, or horns, facing the eastern door.
In front of it a ritual fire is kept burning. . . . The roadchief [chief
officiant] prays to the Father Peyote, who is the manifest God, just as
Jesus Christ is the Father incarnate. The leader eats the first four
peyotes and passes the sack around until everyone has also eaten four. . . .
Christian hymns are often sung in meetings, and the Bible is sometimes
things vaguely resembling it in intoxicating action, such as the mescal bean (seed of
Sophora secundiflora), and peyotl. The identification of peyotl with teo-nanacatl, a
poisonous mushroom also used in Mexico for producing hallucinations, appears to
be incorrect (22, pp. 128-30 ; 33 ; 34).
176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 355
seen on the altar with the fetish peyote. ... the moral values of
Christianity pervade the peyote cult. . . . The Indian actually merges
the two religions. He believes that the white man's God and his own are
the same, but that each approaches him in his own way or by his own
road (30).
Although continually gaining new converts and spreading into new
regions, the peyotl religion appears to be dying out among the tribes that
embraced it earliest. La Barre (22, p. 90) mentions some " precognitive
"
happenings in such meetings, but unfortunately gives no details. For
what they are worth, I quote them here :
. . . prophecy in minor matters still occurs via peyote {e.g. the Delaware
case in which a serious industrial accident might have been avoided if
he had only been able to interpret correctly a warning peyote gave him).
Old-time Comanche could hear the enemy while still away off when they
ate peyote, and in making raids could discover the whereabouts of
horses, etc. White Wolf, again, visioned Charley Seminole's face all
bloody at a peyote meeting, but was unable to interpret the prophecy ;
somewhat later, sure enough, the Seminole accidentally shot himself
under the eye.
Psychologists and other persons of European descent studying the effects
of peyotl have ordinarily taken about an ounce of the dried plant, or an
equivalent amount of the alkaloid, say one-fifth of a gram of mescaline
sulphate. The doses taken by the Indians are two to twenty times as
large. The typical effects of the drug are as follows, though there is much
individual variation. There is first nausea, varying in intensity from a
vague feeling of discomfort up to actual sickness. It can usually be relieved
by a small quantity of food or drink. One case has been recorded where an
excessive dose produced a feeling of imminent death (15). Then there is a
sharper perception of colour, light and shade, and often a coloured flicker,
typically blue, begins to play around the outlines of objects. On closing the
eyes or going into a darkened room coloured visions appear. At first these
are simply colours without definite outlines, and in one subject, who
states that he is normally devoid of the power of visual imagery, they
hardly passed beyond this stage (16). Usually, however, more or less
geometrical patterns appear, such as coloured rain, fields of jewels or
flowers, interlacing spirals, fretwork, arabesques and the like, usually in
motion. It is possible that the background of these designs is furnished by
the blood circulation immediately behind the retina (25, 26, 27). These
are followed by more organic forms, birds' or butterflies' wings, vegetation,
landscapes, and in the last stages animal or human forms appear, the latter
usually in quaint and unfamiliar costumes. The last effect is often a night
or two of " absolutely restful insomnia " (16). When sleep supervenes
dreams do not appear to be influenced in any way by the drug. The whole
process occupies perhaps eight to twenty hours, during which time hunger,
thirst, and fatigue are at least partly suppressed. For this reason the
Indians of Mexico often eat peyotl on long journeys. In some subjects
peyotl produces disorientation in spatial relations and in the sense of time
(15, 16, 19).

[Part !
'
The following extracts from first-hand accounts will give some idea of
the visions and other mental phenomena. In the first case there were no
visions (36) :
Fifteen minutes afterwards I experienced slight dyspnoea accompanied
by transient headache, which symptoms were rapidly followed by inter-
mittent tetanoid spasms in the hands and feet, and with a sensation of i
general bien aise. A sense of egotistical concentration, together with a
delightful feeling of irresponsibility toward one's surroundings, sue-' !
ceeded, and lasted, in all, eleven hours. No spectral illusions were
present, however ; neither was there any vertigo nor subsequent i
drowsiness. The heart was accelerated during the whole of the period, ;
the radial pulse varying between 80 and 90. The pupils were unaffected,
and the digestive powers were undiminished.
In the second case coloured visions were seen, but did not develop to
any great extent. There was however temporal and spatial dislocation (16)
:
During most of the observations I was bothered with stomachic
aches and pressure in the abdomen, and later with continuous frontal
and occipital headache. ... I reclined and bandaged the eyes ... a spot
of white light of low intensity appeared about the center of the horopter
[field of view]. From then [1.43 p.m.] until 2.58 there were intermittent
color effects. Colors from violet to orange appeared, but seldom red.
The colors were rarely of a high degree of saturation. Two spatial
forms were present . . . one in the form of an arc in the upper half of the
horopter, and the other in the form of lines down the center of the horopter. :
The colors seemed to be in constant movement. They did not seem to
be affected when I opened the eyes inside the blinders, which were
entirely light-proof. ... At 3.22 the blinders were replaced and the \
color effects began immediately. During this period colored circles
appeared, always spinning in a counter-clockwise direction. . . . The
blinders were then [about 3.54] removed, and the parts of my body, seen
visually, seemed to be very far away. I extended my arm and fixated
the finger-tips, and then stretched the arm away from me. The hand
seemed to move a distance of at least ten feet. The stenographer moved
her head and shoulders back a few inches, and she seemed to be drawing
back many times that distance. This distortion of space was present for
both monocular and binocular vision. . . . Accompanying the distortion
of space there was also a distortion of time. A given period of time
seemed very much more extended than normally. Speech seemed slow.
Walking became a ponderous affair. In walking I felt successively
sensations from the muscles and joints involved. I became aware at
each step, for example, of the sensations due to the curling of the toes.
The third example illustrates fully developed hallucinations (10) :
Visions began to appear within twenty-five minutes after ingestion
of the drug. At first they were simple in pattern and colouring, and
were visible only with the eyes shut. Later they became more compli-
cated ;
they no longer comprised geometrical designs, but took on three-
dimensional form, appearing as figures and scenes, all most brilliantly
1
176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 357
illuminated and coloured, and all changing with the utmost rapidity. The
hallucinations now became apparent with the eyes open, though never to
the same extent as when the eyes were closed. . . . The first vision con-
sisted of a black diamond edged with green, followed shortly by circles
of yellow light against a dark background. Next appeared something
recalling a desert scene. " On the horizon is a setting sun, lighting up the
landscape with a dark-red glow. The radiations from the sun are a beauti-
ful combination of red and black. In the foreground are several black
figures as though they might be camel riders or trees. The foreground
now begins to assume a greenish-yellow colour." ... "A particularly
picturesque scene : an old-fashioned single span bridge across the upper
reaches of a river. There are large stones at the sides of the stream and
a narrow navigable channel in the middle. A \ery restful picture . . . now
there is a sort of close-up of the bridge, which is of the old-fashioned type
composed of large blocks of stone . . . while looking at the bridge a pillar
has appeared in the centre and transformed it into a double-span bridge.
. . . The water is quite still and there are sharply delineated shadows in
various tints of blue, green and yellow. . . . The water now starts to
ripple ; it is now drying up and the rocky bed becomes visible. . . . The
bridge is getting smaller and the rocky bed is gradually becoming trans-
formed into a stone road in a moorland scene."
Sometimes the sensations seem to have diff^ered in kind from those of
everyday life, as in this last example (the artist in 15) :
The first paroxysm.s were the most violent. They would come on
with tinglings in the lower limbs, and with the sensation of a nauseous
and suffocating gas mounting up into my head. Two or three times this
was accompanied by a color vision of the gas bursting into flame as it
passed up my throat. ... At another time my eye seemed to be turning
into a vast drop in which millions of minute creatures resembling tad-
poles were in motion. . . . My right leg suddenly became heavy and
solid ; it seemed, indeed, that the whole weight of my body had shifted
into one part, about the thigh and knee, and that the rest of my body had
lost all substantiality. ... At one moment the color, green, acquired a
taste in my mouth ; it was sweetish and somewhat metallic ; blue
again would have a taste that seemed to recall phosphorus ; ... the
strangest of all my color visions . . . began with a feeling that the skin of
my face was becoming quite thin and of no stouter consistency than
tissue paper, and the feeling was suddenly enhanced by a vision of my
face, paper-like and semitransparent and somewhat reddish in color.
To my amazement I saw myself as though I were inside a Chinese
lantern, looking out through my cheek into the room.
The visual phenomena are in most cases visions rather than hallucina-
tions, as they are seen only in the dark or with closed eyes. Opening the
eyes normally dispels them, though the real objects then seen may be
perceived with some modification of their normal appearance, or in the
observer's mental attitude to them. Occasionally the visions persist with
open eyes, taking up a position among or hiding real objects, and they
would then rank as genuine hallucinations. The visions do not seem to be
358 A. y. C. Wilson [Part
reproductions of objects previously seen, and are rarely under volitional
control, though Indians of the peyotl religion claim that with practice they
can alter or suppress entirely their visions (17, 29). In the developed
stages the source of the visions is presumably the subliminal consciousness
of the observer ;
the remarkable similarity of the visions in the early
stages—the " form constants " of Kluver (20)—supports the suggestion
of a physiological basis for them (25, 26, 27). If the source of the de-
veloped visions is in the subliminal, that is if the effect of the drug is to
weaken the barrier between the conscious and the unconscious, the occa-
sional occurrence of telepathic phenomena would be explained, as these
processes appear to take place subliminally (i, 5). Rouhier tried the effect
of an extract of peyotl on six subjects (32), one of whom developed apparent
telepathic abilities (31). During the period of his visions he occasionally
saw objects thought of by one of the persons, and in a case of apparent
telepathic clairvoyance he described in some detail a bedroom with an
empty bed. The bed should have been occupied, but it was established
that it was in fact empty at the time of the vision. Warcollier (5) quotes
what appears to be the percipient's account of the same event. I translate
the latter here, in preference to condensing Rouhier's longer version.
A first vision of the head of Dante and of that of Henri IV having
succeeded perfectly, Mme S. wished to try to make me see a little book
that she knew was to be found at the home of her cousin, a cousin who
had just become a mother and whom she believed to be in bed in her
room at the time of our experiments. Almost at once I had a vision of a
room of which I described the furniture, the hangings and the bed, but,
contrary to what Mme S. believed, I saw this bed empty, and, in spite of
all her efforts to make me see the person whom she believed to be in bed
there, I persisted in depicting it absolutely empty. Among the objects
furnishing this room and which she recognized from my descriptions
were two objects that astonished her : a bottle of brown perfume in a
cardboard box and a pot of tooth-paste. ... As for the book that she
wished me to see, there was no trace in the room.
The next day our friends had, if not the answer to the riddle, at
least the explanation of the fact. At the time of our experiments, her
cousin, taking advantage of a moment when she was alone with her
nurse, had got up for the first time and had sat down in a neighbouring
room, carrying away the famous book that I had been unable to find. As
for the two unknown bottles, they had just, an hour before, been given
to the young mother and were as yet unknown to anyone in the family.
It would be easy to criticize the conditions under which this experiment
was conducted, but it is one of the few that have been recorded in detail.
2. Ayahuasca
There has been considerable confusion between ayahuasca (caapi) and
yage (caapi-pinima), as their effects are very similar and the two are often
used in conjunction by the Indians. It seems clear however that there are
two distinct species of plants involved, ayahuasca consisting of Banisteria
Caapi and related species {B. inehrians, B Riisbyana, etc.) and yage of
Haemadictyon amazonicum. The latter is distinguished from the former
176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 359
by the blood-red veins of its leaves ;
among the tribes that call ayahuasca
(aya-huasca = dead man's vine) caapi (caa-pi = narrow leaf), yage is called
caapi-pmvna (painted caapi) in allusion to these veins (/^4). The active
constituent of ayahuasca is the alkaloid hannine, found also in the Russian
plant Peganum harmala and having some applications in medicine.
^
The various species of ayahuasca are climbing plants (lianas) growing
in the upper reaches of the Amazon and its tributaries, and also in similar
habitats on the western slopes of the Andes. Their height may exceed one
hundred feet. They are sometimes cultivated by the Indians along the
borders of their manioc plantations. A preparation of the lower stems is
used, these being either ground with water or simply boiled until a drink of
suitable strength results. Spruce (44) gives the following description of the
use of ayahuasca at a " feast of gifts " :
In November 1852 I was present, by special invitation, at a Dabocuri
or feast of gifts, held in a malloca or village house called Urubu-coara
(Turkey-buzzard's nest), above the first falls of the Uaupes ; ... We
reached the malloca at nightfall, just as the butiitos or sacred trumpets
began to boom lugubriously within the margin of the forest skirting the
wide space kept open and clear of weeds around the malloca. At that
sound every female outside makes a rush into the house, before the
butiitos emerge on the open, for merely to see one of them would be to
her a sentence of death. We found about 300 people assembled, and the
dances at once commenced. . . .
In the course of the night the young men partook of caapi five or six
times in the interv als between the dances ; but only a few of them at a
time, and very few of them drank of it twice. The cup-bearer—who
must be a man, for no woman can touch or taste caapi—starts at a short
run from the opposite end of the house, with a small calabash containing
about a teacupful of caapi in each hand, muttering " Mo-mo-mo-mo-
mo " as he runs, and gradually sinking down until at last his chin nearly
touches his knees, when he reaches out one of the cups to the man who
stands ready to receive it, and when that is drunk off, then the other
cup. In two minutes or less the effects begin to be apparent. The
Indian turns deathly pale, trembles in every limb, and horror is in his
aspect. Suddenly contrary symptoms succeed : he bursts into a
perspiration, and seems possessed with reckless fury, seizes whatever arms
are at hand, his murucu, bow and arrows, or cutlass, and rushes to the
doorway, where he inflicts violent blows on the ground or the doorposts,
calling out all the while :" Thus would I do to mine enemy (naming him
by his name) were this he! " In about ten minutes the excitement has
passed off, and the Indian grows calm, but appears exhausted. Were he
at home in his hut he would sleep off the remaining fumes, but now he
must shake off his drowsiness by renewing the dance.
^ Reinberg (43) gives a list of the names among various tribes. Usual synonyms
for ayahuasca mclude xaya-huasca, iyona, Ciri-panga, natema, kaxpi, kaapi, kapi,
nepi, nepe, pinde ; for yag^ they include yaj6, yahe yajen, yaje, iahi, kaapi-pinima,
kadana-pira, kulikaxpiro, mihi. The identity of yage with Haernadictyon amazoni-
curn is not quite certain ; neither Spruce nor Reinberg saw yage in flower, and the
identification was based mainly on comparison of the leaves.
360 A. J. C. Wilson [Part
Here it seems that the plant was used simply for the pleasureable effect
of the intoxication and the hallucinations, but it is employed in greater
amount and with perhaps the addition of yage or huanto {Datura arboren,
active principle presumably hyoscine) by the medicine men when their
professional services are required for the recovery of stolen property,
foreseeing the approach of the enemy, discovery of unfaithful wives, and
in other important affairs of primitive life. When so used the waking
hallucinations are continued into a profound unconsciousness, on
awakening from, which the medicine man relates and interprets his visions.
First-hand accounts of ayahuasca visions are rare, and there is not the
profusion of studies by psychologists that one finds in the case of peyotl.
Travellers in the regions where it grows are however agreed that the
initial hallucinations are pleasant, consisting of such things as butterflies,
flowers, birds, cities, aerial views, and that these are followed by terrifying
appearances, such as monsters, jungle beasts, armed opponents. I have
been unable to find an account of a veridical hallucination affecting a
person of European descent after its use. Reinberg (43) drank about a
teacupful of a decoction made by boiling 120 cm. of ayahuasca stem and
five or six yage leaves in one and a half litres of water until the quantity was
reduced to one-quarter litre ; he gives the following description of his
experiences :
There is some difficulty in swallowing saliva, and I have almost a
sensation of paralysis of the muscles of the neck and larynx. Before my
eyes shine luminous circles, phosphenes [spots of light], and I see flying
in a eblouissant sky butterflies belonging to the species collected this
morning, which are abundant here. The view is very clear, too clear,
and it seems to me that I am looking through a little hole pierced in a
card. ... I observe all symptoms with a perfect clarity of mind and am
present at all happenings as if it were someone else ajfected and this
symptom specially impressed me. I have pains in my ears : salivation
is increased : I have no nausea. But Teofilo had explained to me that
nausea [mareacion) is the precursor of [paranormal] dreams. . . .
Reinberg then took more of the decoction, and had such violent physical
symptoms that he abandoned the experiment and attempted restorative
treatment. Spruce was given caapi at the feast described above, but was
overwhelmed with various other native delicacies before he was able to
observe any visual effects.
3. Yage
Yage also is a climbing plant, but attains a height of only ten to fifteen
feet. Its reputation as an inducer of telepathic visions is greater than that
of either peyotl or ayahuasca, so much so that Zerda Bayon (49) named its
active principle telepatina, which has been regularized as telepathine.
Barriga Villalba (45), who isolated it independently, named it yageine,
which is perhaps a more suitable name for ordinary chemical use. It is
prepared and used by the Indians in much the same way as ayahuasca, and
the visions it induces are similar, though a bluish aureole is said to be
characteristic. Rouhier (48) analysed a native preparation, and found that
it contained 0.26% of yageine. Yageine is poisonous, doses of about 0.2
176] Ayahuasca, Peyotl, Yage 361
gram per kilogram of body weight being sufficient to kill guinea pigs. The
immediate cause of death is cessation of breathing.
It is difficult to form an opinion on the supposed telepathic property of
yage. Many accounts agree on its reputation among the Indians, but it is
probably safe to say that no instances exist of the standard required for
printing by the Society as evidential. The only detailed case I have found
is the following :
I was induced after considerable hesitation on my part by Colonel
Custodio Morales, Commandant of the military detachment in the
Intendencia of the Caqueta, who wished to try the effects of yage upon
himself in my hut on the bank of the river Hacha, to give him 15 drops
of a preparation of yage which at the time I believed to be its active
principle. He took the tincture at night in a jar of water, and in the
morning, at reveille, he came to me with the news of the death of his
father, who lived in Ibague, and of the illness of his little sister, whom he
loved, very dearly. All this he declared that he had seen during the
night ; no one had arrived who could have communicated such news to
him, and the nearest post or telegraph office is at least 15 days' journey
away. About a month after this strange vision a courier happened to
arrive with letters which announced to him the death of his father and the
recovery of his sister from a serious illness. It should be mentioned that
Colonel Morales is a man of eminently nervous constitution, that he was
very ill-fed, and that he is highly intelligent.
This story is quoted from a letter from Dr. Rafael Zerda Bayon in the
Times (49) ; a version differing only in minor details is given by Warcollier
(5) from a South American source. Warcollier was unable to obtain
confirmation direct from Colonel Morales. The incident is suggestive,
but many similar occurrences with corroboration from the percipient or
others conversant with the circumstances would be needed before it could
be admitted that yage deserves its telepathic reputation.
SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY
There are very many publications dealing directly or incidentally with
these plants, and an exhaustive bibliography would be prohibitively long.
The following list contains (i) relevant publications consulted in detail in
preparing this note, and (ii) a few publications that appear from abstracts
or references to be important, but which for some reason could not be
consulted. The latter are distinguished by printing the author's name in
italics. The fullest bibliography on peyotl, extending to some fourteen
pages, is given by La Barre (22).
