º ..". As wins to the Questions Critical and Philosophical
* ... CCCXXV. By Hinckleiensis, the Proposer. .
“The requisites to constitute the character of a Gentleman completely
are many :-They are, perfect ease of deportment, even under the
most embarrassing circumstances: manners that conciliate and gain
universal esteem; good breeding, so disciplined as never to be
thrown from its guard, or, except on the most extraordinary occasions,
betrayed to the discovery of passion: a smooth and flowing enuncia
tion: a bland gaiety of heart that no trifles can disturb: a flattering,
yet not officious, attention to every person present: and all those
charms of address aud demeanour which cannot fail to v in our es
teenth. . . . -
* I should define a gentleman, then, a person well born and edu
cated : manifesting elegance of behaviour, gracefulness of mien,
micely of taste ; and of pleasant manners with virtuous habits. Above
the vulgar by his character, situation, and fortune: uniting polite
ness of address with meekness and gentleness of behaviour.
* Mr. W. Stringer says: According to the usual acceptation, a gen
tleman is a man possessed of wealth. But a true gentleman is he who
acts, as a person of affluence ought to act, that is, charitably, intel
lectually, ſiberally, and honourably. He is no gentleman, properly
speaking, (however great his wealth) who is guilty of a mean action.
Nor is lie much short of one, whose mind is of an exalted nature, who
possesses liberality of sentinent, a generous disposition, and an up
right soul, even though he be destitute of wealth. As for those, who,
although,they possess what the world call independence, yet daily
prove that they have nothing good, gentle, or honourable, in their
composition ; nothing can be a greater mistake than to call such
creatures gentlemen.
- - - CCCXXVI. - º
Several of the early councils required the Clergy to wear apparel
suitable to their profession ; but they prescribed neither kind nor co
iour. See Conc. Carth. 4. c. 45. & Conc. Agathen. c. 20. The first
held A. D. 400, the second A. D. 505. Nor, indeed, is it likely
that bisheps and presbyters should wear a distinct habit out of the
church, during the three first centuries, when tyrants and persecutors
were diligently seeking them in order to destroy them. Åt Constan
tinople, in the time of Chrysostom and Arsacius, the clergy commonly
went in black, as the Novatians did in white; that they might be dis.
tinguished from those schismatics. In process of time the custom be
came general.
As to peculiar vestments worn in the church, they seem to have ob.
tained much earlier. It is clear from Const. Apost. lib, viii, cap.12,
(most probably collected very early in the third century) that during
the eucharist the bishop administered at the altar in a white and shin.

Some of our correspondents refer to Mr. B. Holdich's treatise on
the Resp or Rot, as containing many valuable hints.
- CCCXXVIII. -
The opinions of our correspondents seem nearly balanced in refe
rence to this question. But-Mr. Spencer and a few others decide
against both characters, thus:–The Prodigal and the Miser may be
considered as analogous to positive and negative quantities in Algebra,
‘which destroy each other's effects. It is not easy to cºnceive how
either of them can promote the wealth of the cºuntry. It is evident
that the miser increases nobody's wealth but his ºwn; and though the
prºdigal may scatter his property, yet it is doubtful whether that
property increases by flowing in other channels, in a greater ratio
than the value received for it diminishes. . . . * * * * * * ~ *-
- CCCXXIX. * . . . .” ---> *
The majority of our correspondents agree as to the fact specified in
this question. But they vary greatly in their mode of accounting for
it; some ascribing it to the pre-ordained difference in the constitution
of the sexes; others to habit. The former opinion, however, prevails
amongst them. - - • * ~ *.
CCCXXX. By Mr. B. MANdAli, Woolwich common. . g
In this passage, so often brought upon the controversial arena, it is. .
evident, independent of all critical disquisition, that the interpretation
advanced by those who deny the divinity of our Lord, runs counter
to the whole scope of the Apostle's reasoning in the context. Look
ing, however, to the correct meaning of the passage, the rendering
may be, “Who existing in the form. f God, did not think it,robbery
to be like God; yet he divested or emptied himself [i.e. of his for,
ner glory] when he took ºr received the form of a hondman. The
word form is a confessedly inadequate rendering of, ºppºn; but that
need not be dwelt upon, That rosyai at Stºliterully signifies to be
like God, has heen clearly proved by Whitby Doddridge, and others.
The fair, and I apprehend, the true, interpretation of the Apistle's
meaning is, that the S 'u being in the form of God when he mºde the
world, and appeared to the patriarchs and prºphets, he thought it no
derogation from the honour due to God, that he received from angels
and men like worship with God. As to the inference deducible from
the opposition of the two terms vºdexo, and Magº, in the respective
phrases tº aoepp &is vréezaw, and acetºvºevaow wagºe, it is, I con
ceive, induwiſably this: hat when the Apostte‘speaks of theform of
God, he employs the first of thºse terms, showing thatJesus Christ
aristed in the ſon of God; while, when he speaks ºf thefºrm ºf 4.

6. Emma's Distres. By Mr. T. Nieto, Chester.
Dark was the night, damp mists around her flew,
And stormy winds their ſoudest war-notes blew;
Soon flashing lightnings glanc'd acrºss the plain,
And thunders join'd with copious showers of rain.
Thus travell'd Emma thro’ the trackless waste;
In dread the horrors of the storm she fac'd :
... No tender eye to pity her distress,
* * No door to ope, no place to seek redress;
No bread to eat, no smoking hearth is near,
O sad dilemma 1 hope itself can’t cheer,
“No paper can salute my friends,” she cried,
“To tell my doom, or where, or how, 1 died ?"

Hail, blest Religion! bright celestial maid,

Dispels the vapours that our minds o'erspread, A smoke
Renews our jºy, and gilds each gloomy hour.

Conveyest balsam to his wounded heart, .
And wipest from his eyes the briny tears. " salt

Who have one sister-dear:

(1) Quest. 1036. Answered by Investicator, the Proposer.
Cupposes the quantity: a = [nva- (n-H1) Val *= nea—2
(n+1) a-H (n+1)*a ; that is, dividing by a, i=n”—2n (n+1) +
(n+1)*. Then, this equation will be true if n be any integral
positive number: let n=1, then a = [Va—QA/a) *=a–4a–H4a ; and
therefore Va-A/(a–4a–H4a). Taking the root by the usual me
thod, a-4a–Ha(Va–2A/a-—Va the negative root.
we have a
2Va—2A/a)—4a–H4a
–4a–4–4a
• And an analogous result would flow from assuming n = 2, 3, 4, &c.
Similar to this were the Answers transmitted by Messrs. Lam
plugh, Edward Page, R. Prance, John Smith, and R. Taylor.
Other solutions were received from Messrs. Ambulator, John
Baines, jun., IRev. J. Furnass, Ab. Jaques, G. Jones, and John Wil
liamson.
Mr. John Abram, of Canterbury, gave an ingenious answer, upon

the supposition that it was required to find the root V. by a direct

method, instead of taking it equal to —Va. We regret that his
- * -- a -
curious investigation is too long for insertion here.
. Some of our Correspondents refer to No. 13 ºf Leyhoun's Repo
sitory for a good solution to this question by Mr. White; but the
Proposer of the question in this Diary could not be aware of that
sºlutions as is evident from the date of the respective publications.

known that KE?=KD. KF : therefore, KD2–KD : KP=KD (KD– º
—KF), is given. Hence the ratio of(KD+KF) (KD—KF): KD (KD'
—KF), or KD+KF : KD, or KD : KF, is given. But KDs–KF2 is,*
given; therefore KD and KF are given, and consequently AK, and
its double AB, are given. Hence, there are given the segments -
AD,DB, and the ratio of the sides AC to BC, to construct the tri-º-
angle ACB." Thus is the matter reduced to a well-known problem.”
