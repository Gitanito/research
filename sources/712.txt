 The masthead proclaimed that Wade's enterprise had been begun in December 1888, indicating some previous publication, but the first issues of this magazine were published by Wade under the name Greeley, with new numbering (1/1, January 1889),  and by July at least the title had become Truths of Nature.  Wade (1832 or 1833-1905), who published a series of general-science (he was an ornithologist) and textile journals before turning to the spiritual, seems to have had a proclivity to changing the name of his journals.  Published gossip on developments in the Theosophical Society, astrological notes, short translations from Eliphas Levi, Noted in "Occultism and Theosophy.  An Exposition of the Truths of Nature," Light, October 18, 1890): 508, which announced the appearance of the journal's successor: Occultism and Theosophy.  Wade was the publisher of Posthumous Memories of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1896), received through a Yost typewriter operated by the spirit of HPB.  On Wade, see also the note under Occultism: Key of Nature.
