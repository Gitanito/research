so with that I&#39;d like to open it up to
questions now I know that it&#39;s a rather
large audience is there another mic for
them or and someone who can run or do
you just need to shout out okay we&#39;ll
just shout out because apparently
there&#39;s no other mic and I can&#39;t pass
this one around so I if you speak loud
enough for me to hear you I will then
repeat the question so everyone can hear
it and also it can be heard to the
webinar listeners yes sir well thank you
I love you too yeah you&#39;re lovely
beautiful was a great question what can
we do what can the people do to help
expedite the bringing forth of these
worth saving technologies first let me
clarify there is no but there are people
who have operational systems today all
of them that I know of every single one
of them are in either corporate or
intellectual property tie ups that
guarantee they will not benefit humanity
so they have made every strategic error
possible if you want to look at there&#39;s
a four-hour webinar and thing I did on a
new energy and transdimensional physics
that&#39;s up on our youtube.com slash s
disclosure site but also on Vimeo Arvind
site on where you can see at the hole
for our under uninterrupted where I go
into this in granular detail so I
recommend that to people but it quickly
what I&#39;m at this stage attempting to do
is to advise a number of venture capital
and other folks how to put together a
multi sintered R&amp;D program so that
within a year or two we would have
multiple versions of these devices some
would allow conventional technologies
like the internal combustion engine to
run on water others that&#39;s transitional
because it takes fifteen years to
replace all the motors in the world
others would be zero-point energy that
hopefully would be solid-state and the
one that we&#39;re leaving and off off of
the the plan right now or is the the
antigravity things that fly at the
current time the good news is that every
few months I learn of another scientist
or group that has an operational system
the very bad news it&#39;s heartbreaking and
this will disturb you is that in every
single case they&#39;re either made they
have already made fatal strategic errors
because naively they think if we have a
technology we can bring it out as I was
saying earlier like you do another app
or smartphone and for that reason they
are in the box
and they&#39;re in a box where they are
already caught in the trap the net and
it means that there is no zero
probability they will get out to benefit
the human race because if they want to
go the patent route it&#39;s going to be
seized if you divide it into a thousand
patents the intelligence community
already knows you&#39;re doing that and it&#39;s
still going to be seized if you go to
trade secret sea route it&#39;s going to
have a national security order on it if
you get involved with entities that are
corporate entities that don&#39;t understand
what they&#39;re up
against their ending to end up if their
primary interest is money they&#39;re gonna
get bought out and it&#39;ll be black
shelf-like to worry and India just made
this deal with an industrial concern in
India and it&#39;s a legitimate overunity
system as I would say it&#39;s almost
certainly dead at this point
Rossi who has the e-cat system and in
the Elian our technology a friend of
mine connected to the National Security
Agency they&#39;ve had a bead on him for a
very long time and I was told to it was
about three years ago that there would
be no chance he&#39;d go forward a
multi-billionaire who just met with him
on Saturday said yes he&#39;s he&#39;s out of
pocket it&#39;s it&#39;s it can&#39;t go out now
there&#39;s a hole I mean I would have to
spend another four hours going through
the reasons for the strategic plan that
I have and a key part of the strategic
plan that I have is that all of you
become stakeholders not financially
necessarily but stakeholders in terms of
the networking so that if we open up or
if someone hands off to me a system
that&#39;s operational the first thing we
will do is a see that it&#39;s reproducible
and legitimate and disclose it massively
so when we did the disclosure project
you know upwards of 800 million people
around the world eventually heard about
it that was before the internet had the
capacity as it does now with social
media live streaming all this stuff this
would be the biggest press conference in
the world there would be no secrecy
around it from the minute we know it&#39;s
legitimate now unfortunately the vast
majority of things we&#39;ve investigated
are actually frauds and tricks and we
lost about a million dollars going
around the world going down rabbit holes
of tricksters and I think that that&#39;s
one of the real problems is all the
tricksters so we have to we know exactly
what they it was a very steep learning
curve and you don&#39;t do this for 25 years
and learn nothing
however I also know that it can be done
and it can be done relatively quickly
because I have a computer disk that has
hundreds of seized patents that a guy in
this kind of CIA had a man copy allowed
to copy and that is on a computer disk
and I have it now that&#39;s a
two-dimensional on disk but so you have
to have a laboratory do this my goal is
to have a multi if we could do this
properly there would be a multi centered
effort where like the software
development group github we&#39;re trying to
fix up a coding problem people from many
places jump in and they&#39;re sharing
information and solutions in real time
open and source totally open source no
intellectual property so you have a few
scientific research teams decentralized
all working on this but sharing in real
time the breakthroughs they have and
you&#39;re gonna collapse time frames so
instead of having the redundancy of
everyone trying to recreate the wheel
everyone&#39;s benefiting from the iterative
process of research and development at
the same time this would be
live-streamed
maximum capacity where and it would be
announced to the public and major PR
campaign so that millions of eyeballs
are watching in that lab and seeing the
data reporting out in real time and
therefore you&#39;re not you&#39;ve created a
strategic security around the inevitable
search and seizure that happens around
these devices not just United States but
anywhere in the world to get seized the
other part of this strategy therefore is
a key part of it are the people getting
invested not with money necessarily
although then hurt I mean I wish we had
the fun
we don&#39;t yet but also being invested in
what they know and telling everyone this
is happening because you can&#39;t count on
the lamestream media or CNN to carry
this I have seen too many big stories
that I&#39;ve been part of killed by the
major networks in Hollywood and and the
big media because they are very corrupt
and in this case luckily if you do that
its strategy that involves by passing
these chokeholds in information and news
look I mean I just did something not
long ago about the deep national
security state has had millions of views
on YouTube
I mean CNN would kill to get those
numbers for a lot of their shows
so we don&#39;t need that but we have this
alternative new media that didn&#39;t exist
10 years ago Facebook didn&#39;t Twitter
didn&#39;t being delivered a live stream at
those kind of numbers didn&#39;t and when we
did the National Press Club event 15
years ago in May we used up every t1
line in the city of Washington and they
were overloaded now you don&#39;t have that
problem the capacity is infinitely more
therefore let&#39;s take this technology
that it has developed utilize it to
frustrate the strategic nexus of search
seizure and suppression and it creates
not only a enormous security around
everyone working on it the security is
because these vampires who work in these
dark covert programs don&#39;t want to be
caught in a billion watt searchlight
grabbing a technology in real time they
don&#39;t that&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;m not
dead
in 1991 I met with an attorney who
worked with this group magic majestic
and he said whatever you do don&#39;t do
what you&#39;re doing
secretively or quietly or you&#39;re a dead
man and I took his advice is why I went
on Larry King Live and all those shows I
think this is this is a counterintuitive
because in the world of technology
science development the name of the game
is this golem holding and and what
people can do
out who are listening number one
spread the word Network number two get
educated on it if you haven&#39;t seen that
for our a seminar I did on
transdimensional physics look at it
study it if you know of someone who&#39;s an
inventor or scientist who has an
operational device sitting in their
garage or laboratory but they&#39;re afraid
of going forward with it hook them up
with me and have them hand it off it
needs to be handed off openly quickly
transparently all of you need to be
Scouts for this and if you know people
who have our high net worth who can
contribute to a fund to support this
they should contact me as soon as
possible because I we want to set up a
meeting like a Jekyll Island meeting a
meeting that would read that where we
put these elements together and go
forward very quickly so that networking
needs to happen so those are things that
are immediate things you can do and also
we need each of you to be talent scouts
for if we if if if we&#39;re able to do this
in the next few months we&#39;re going to
need a lot of talent
top-drawer scientists project management
everything else and we&#39;re gonna need to
raid some really talented people and I&#39;m
not talking I mean these it has to be at
the I hate to say it at the ER doctor
level a professional boom you know like
hardcore professionals and we need those
people and so talent and I was talking
to a gentleman in Orange County
yesterday before yesterday and he said
one of the big problems with what
they&#39;re doing is talent getting people
who can actually manage this planning
scientists who can get up to speed on
this new physics and it is a hard area
of science but they&#39;ve all been miss
educated by you know electrodynamics and
electromechanical and in the EES any you
know all any people going through the
traditional physics and traditional
electronics would have to be go through
a crash course of this new type of
energy
and there&#39;s a lot of legitimate science
and it can be done very quickly but we
need to find people who would do that
who are willing to go the distance the
fear factor that keeps people from going
forward is neutralized by you and we the
people remember I&#39;m not saying this out
of speculation we did the largest
disclosure event in history every single
virtually every single person I was
working with on that who came forward
had top-secret clearances or it&#39;s not
signed national security oaths
not a one of them to this day have been
threatened harmed or silenced why
because we had this strategic security
in place not all of which I&#39;m discussing
but it&#39;s there so forget the fear and
forget the intimidation factor and we
need to make a run at this we need to do
it and the other thing everyone can do
is put this in consciousness and in
prayer and protection and for our
protection because it&#39;s very powerful
we need people doing that that&#39;s
something everybody can do so there are
a few things yes ma&#39;am
are you asking about the energy
technology or the meditation techniques
okay
those yes on our website serious
disclosure calm there are meditation CDs
there&#39;s a whole training kit for ce-5
contact groups there&#39;s the app I
mentioned that actually has the entire
meditation and the remote viewing
protocols and coherent thoughts
sequencing protocols and the electronic
tones that we send out all that&#39;s on an
app that $6.99 so all that is there
serious disclosure calm so there&#39;s a
huge amount of available information yes
also there are links from that site to
the Orion project on the physics end of
it that allow people to study all the
the history and reports that are
scientific and it me if you drill down
to all the links it goes into hundreds
of thousands of pages and but you know
that&#39;s there so yes there are yes sir
the mantra is really one word in a
sentence it&#39;s three syllables and it
means I give myself or two the unbounded
himself the unbounded being it literally
means that a literalistic translation
where I bow down before the great an
unbounded mind and consciousness but it
what it really means is I I the
individual and this is what true
humility is by the way I am willing to
let my drop become the ocean and to give
up one&#39;s and allow that to be what we
are
yes it and that&#39;s literally what it
means in Sanskrit the the mantra yes sir
is it possible I&#39;ve heard about like the
tuning of the instrumentation that we
use today for music well sure he&#39;s
asking about the resonant frequencies of
music and how it needs to be tuned or
can be tuned to be enlivening the
consciousness and there&#39;s a whole school
of thought there&#39;s there&#39;s a whole area
of Vedic knowledge that deals with music
and tonality now everyone has a
different taste in music and but it is
true that over the course of human
development in history the thing that is
most elemental is sound music chanting
this is why in every culture chanting
music the ringing of bowls the beating
of drums these resonant frequencies are
very much part of the experience that
people have that awaken and help center
in sort of a meditative way now I mean
you can also just enjoy cause it&#39;s fun
you know Nine Inch Nails or whoever maha
and you know but they&#39;re and they&#39;re
different but there&#39;s there&#39;s music for
different purposes so what you&#39;re asking
about or is music and tonality that&#39;s
awakened and I think that there&#39;s there
there&#39;s an infinite array of music and
tones and instruments that can be used
and it&#39;s just very intuitive I mean you
talk to people who are masters of sitar
Ravi Shankar and it is truly a spiritual
state and the tones and what have you
same thing with with much of the
beautiful music in ancient Japan or
Native American or
and that is true and the reason it&#39;s
effective is the mantras a sound and the
first emanation if you study the Vedas
from the unbounded field of pure
consciousness
the first emanation into relativity in
the structure of the cosmos isn&#39;t
lighter form
it&#39;s the tonality is that primal sound
thought and that then from the sound the
form emerges that is transdimensional
astral and then matter so within the saw
if you look at every single person in
this room every star in the galaxy
everything that exists every grain of
sand that individual discrete thing has
a resonant tone within it and this can
be directly experienced in fact when I
had this on the third on the third full
moon of 1990 when I was asked to form
this project if you read the book hidden
truth forbidden knowledge it goes
through all with it what happened each
month but on the third one when I had
this spacecraft in the front of this big
estate I had in North Carolina near the
Biltmore house up in Nashville North
Carolina there was a experience where I
went out in our solar system and I saw
the moon and actually I saw these
massive objects all near the dark side
near the between the dark and light side
the moon hovering there massive and of
course we&#39;ve recently gotten
intelligence that there are there and
then I went out to our solar system and
I was actually in a state of
consciousness with these with these very
advanced ETS that they were at the level
where they operate from their physical
and they have physical spacecraft but
they&#39;re incredibly transdimensional but
they&#39;re technologies emanate from the
level of god-consciousness the level of
the the RET the celestial and even their
spacecraft are like meeting a divine
avatar I mean it&#39;s hard to describe this
is very very abstract but anyway so I
was out in space in our solar system and
I went into this deep meditative state
and went into Samadhi and then into this
unity consciousness state or I could see
everything was consciousness and as I
turned to the earth I was introduced to
the earth as a female actual being a
conscious being not human but a
planetary consciousness and she&#39;s female
absolutely Mars as male was introduced
to him
Venus&#39;s female worker is gay or he&#39;s
sort of and Raji sort of both oh yes and
then Saturn was female a Jupiter was
male and so it went and I could actually
interact with the consciousness and was
introduced to them and it was beautiful
I mean it was amazing and then I real to
a state where I heard as each planet was
spinning in our solar system a pure note
hmm now this sounds really corny and
cliche the music of the spheres it is
real and I actually perceived it
directly perceived it and I went oh this
is beautiful I mean I wish I was a
musician I can&#39;t recreate that I don&#39;t
know if anyone could and I could hear
the resonant frequency tone that was
giving rise to the light the astral
transdimensional white body of these a
planetary beings which were planets that
were then creating matter in space-time
so it went from unbounded consciousness
through this tonality of tone into the
formation of the white body the astral
body of the planet like you have an
astral body to the physical planet and I
could perceive all of it tracking it all
the way back to source and as I began to
hear each one
they then started blending together and
sort of a symphony or harmonic and then
I became aware of the Sun and the other
stars and planets and I went in an
instant where I heard the pure tonality
of everything that is in creation that
then merged into one perfect primal tone
emanating from the infinity and with
that I transcended into that Brahman
consciousness where your you are one
with the entire cosmos in creation and
also with unbounded mind it was the
moment the most beautiful years went by
before I could talk about this
experience without crying is so
beautiful and then of course I realized
that&#39;s all folded within each and every
one of us and every point in space and
time has the reality of what I just
described
folded within it see there&#39;s so much to
explore if you understand who you are
it&#39;s beautiful and so how do I get off
on the OA bout music I&#39;m sorry so yes
music tonality is is very key and is
very activating in consciousness and
that&#39;s why sacred music all of that is
very important yes sir
while I doubt he was the first one but
yes yeah if I can ask people to ask a
question because no one can hear your
dissertation I have not heard the
instrument you&#39;ve made no I haven&#39;t
heard that device I&#39;d love to hear it if
you have a you can play it this evening
when we come up yep for briefly yes I
bet it&#39;s very real I understand what
what this is about and it is sacred
tonality that also leads to sacred
geometry and forms and then the the
constructs of consciousness all of that
is residing and it enlivens the
consciousness to hear it or even see it
that&#39;s why mandalas work crop circles if
their deepest meaning are like an
activation in consciousness of the forms
and it&#39;s what the ones that aren&#39;t faked
there are actually archetype forms and
in live and awareness on a deep level
and they&#39;re made uh we can get into I
know exactly how they&#39;re made in terms
of the technology that they&#39;re that&#39;s
being used to make them it&#39;s quite
fascinating I&#39;ll give you a hint
if anti-gravity is causing something to
become lighter so it can levitate and
float you can take that same technology
and make something heavier and augment
or increase the gravitational wave field
it within a certain pattern and pull the
crops down and make a pattern that&#39;s
what it is if I follow that yeah so we I
mean I know exactly how they&#39;re doing it
yes ma&#39;am
yes
she&#39;s asking about the what has happened
in the various cycles of Earth history
where at one time a civilization quite
enlightened like the era of the
so-called Shambhala Kingdom an area of
Golden Age that existed where clearly
there was enlightenment and also contact
with ET civilizations how do we get from
how did that happen and then have it
fall into the darkness of ignorance
again this is an interesting phenomenon
because it has to do with regional and
local cycles on earth as opposed to
global cycles so in the development of
Earth over the millions of years the
earth is four billion years old or so
life on Earth has been around for seven
hundred million years so they say
probably longer it gives a very long
time for a lot to have happened and why
our recorded history only goes back a
few thousand years so there have been
civilizations on earth more developed
and advanced than we are now for which
we have no record many of them ended up
getting to a certain point and then
self-destructing and all record would be
lost there was one that was in the area
of northern India and Tibet and the so
called Shambhala kingdom and were the
origins of Sanskrit and the Vedas that
was very enlightened and had the
knowledge of the science of
consciousness and many other
technologies however there were other
areas of the earth not as enlightened
and it then fell into warfare and
darkness and disappeared again
now we&#39;re talking hundreds of thousands
of years ago by the way there&#39;s a man
that I&#39;ve worked with who does a lot of
work for the CIA and the Marines under
contract from I TNT
and when the military
or intelligence community finds a very
ancient
I mean hundred thousands hundreds of
thousands millions of year old device
they take it to him to figure out what
it was used for some of them are
actually ancient earth civilization
remnants some of them are interstellar
extraterrestrial and people have to
understand both exist the distinction
between the time were in now and the
time that we&#39;re talking about the error
in the past was a cycle about four
hundred and fifty thousand years like
Alma Yuga a big giant cycle and Kali
Yuga is what&#39;s closing there&#39;s another
Yuga or cycle opening that&#39;s about half
a million years we are the children of
the transition the closing of one cycle
the opening of another but you&#39;re
talking about in a million year total
for 450 plus half a million it&#39;s about a
million years and we have to have that
perspective that what we&#39;re doing is in
a sense trying to create and guide our
global civilization into a path that is
peaceful and enter global interplanetary
and that is something that has not been
achieved before in the past in the least
the last four hundred and some thousand
years now whether it happened millions
of years ago is open to debate
I mean there are reports of entire
continents Lemuria new Atlantis that
have just vanished they may go back many
millions of years in other cycles where
perhaps we beings evolved on earth that
then became interstellar and are gone
does this make sense and I think that is
the case look we&#39;ve had experiences with
that now remember that that&#39;s where
we&#39;re headed that in a few hundred
thousand years we&#39;re not gonna look
anything
like you do now and we will have been we
will have evolved into an interstellar
species that are eat east of the worlds
so you understand what I mean and even
morphogenetic field genetics epigenetic
release a contact will result in us
being very different in appearance than
we are right now over the next several
hundred thousand years and I want to
tell you a story because it&#39;s not
understood well everybody&#39;s heard of the
area Bentwaters Rendlesham forest event
think it was an eighty one where this
pyramid-shaped craft came down and
landed if you know the disclosure
project witnesses and there are many
others who come forward what most people
don&#39;t realize is that that event which
was a series of events that happened
came about that when when the big
contact event happened with officers
there and this was a nuclear armed
facility that was a covert one it was
not a part of any of the agreements and
treaties and it was a secret nuclear
base and it had had been known that it
was there it could have precipitated
World War three or it may be rioting in
the United Kingdom at the time and so
this et craft interstellar craft came in
came down and hit some blooms it
actually left physical traces that the
Ministry of Defense has released after
the disclosure project in the United
Kingdom and a number of witnesses who
came forward what wasn&#39;t said in which
are only a couple of people who were
right up by the craft and have said but
I don&#39;t want to talk about it publicly
for fear of ridicule C ridicule is the
thing that&#39;s kept all this from coming
out because people don&#39;t want to be
laughed at and the true or it is the
stranger it is but the stranger it is
the more likely it is
people gonna think you&#39;ve lost your mind
alright and it creates its own
hermetically sealed self-correcting
system but the truth is is that when
that event happened there were some
beans that were luminous light like
beans they came out of this black it was
like onyx like glass pyramid a perfect
pyramid that landed and it came out and
the these he teased said to these
officers he&#39;s US Air Force officers who
were right there and they said we are
your descendants from five hundred
thousand years in the future but if you
stay on the course you&#39;re on we may not
exist because if you destroy yourselves
we can&#39;t be so it was people asked me
what were they human or I said well they
were descendants of humans but they were
a very different species in the sense or
in a developed species but from five
hundred thousand years which is at the
end of this particular yuga and that&#39;s
what actually happened at RAF Bentwaters
Air Force Base in England
so that&#39;s shocking it sounds like
something from you know a science
fiction film to many people but it makes
complete sense and this is why I tell
people we have enormous moral
responsibility to not just the world
into people now we&#39;re so self-centered
and narcissistic there are 20,000
generations half a million years worth
of intelligent life and beings who are
ready to come to this planet to evolve
that are waiting for us to get this
right that&#39;s how important this time is
we have to get it right and this is this
is why you step into this if you
do it on in the wrong way you&#39;re taking
off the stage if you&#39;re doing it with
enlightened knowledge somehow is like
Luke Skywalker you just keep missing the
bullet and kind of you know I&#39;ve sort of
missed the bullet for 25 years I don&#39;t
take anything for granted but it&#39;s
because it isn&#39;t about me or anyone else
I&#39;m working with it&#39;s about this purpose
that is is that humanity is to be
eventually interplanetary where we then
spread enlightenment and knowledge and
we bring the equivalent of the Vedas and
all this information to emerging worlds
that are coming along behind us and it&#39;s
an endless cycle of development that
goes on throughout the entire cosmos
one other thing consciousness is
absolutely non-local and therefore is
like the old saying as above so below or
as below so above what we do on this
planet like when we started detonating
atomic bombs that opened the modern era
and quote UFO events because a hornet&#39;s
nest of deeply concerned deep concerned
went up a red flag went over this planet
because we had reached the point where
we could destroy all life on Earth but
also could become an existential threat
to innocent planets out there there are
planets that are very much more
developed than we are that has no
concept of war and then has no weaponry
because they didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t evolve
or descend from a lineage of primates
and chimps where there is this
tribalistic murder impulse they
descended from the equivalent of say
cetaceans or some other species you see
what I&#39;m saying so there&#39;s so we well
everyone&#39;s so worried about the ETS I
said no they&#39;re worried about us I flip
it right around is like is the man in
the mirror you need to look in the
mirror step out of the narcissistic
self-absorbed human anthropocentric
reality look at this
planet in the human race through the
eyes of these other civilizations well
you cannot blame them from being shocked
and appalled and it&#39;s because we have
stayed on a path of conflict separation
and warfare for a hundred years longer
than we should have and we don&#39;t have
muskets and machine guns we have weapons
of mass destruction that could end all
life on this planet we have scalar
technologies that can be a threat
because it&#39;s faster than the speed of
light scalar that are as an existential
threat to other planets and that&#39;s you
have to understand that is within this
mega that we&#39;re operating as diplomatic
teams of these civilizations and this
then speaks to something else very
critical for us to establish this new
Shambhala kingdom that&#39;s a global and
interplanetary civilization we have to
make it through this transition period
and need people to help guide and
protect us as we do so there are ETS
doing it they&#39;re humans doing it and we
need the masses to see it and actuate it
manifest it but in the meanwhile you
have to walk the mystical path with
practical feet you mean you want to go
out make contact you have to understand
the reason the ETS are going to the
least likely way and actual
extraterrestrial civilization is going
to interact is in 3d because of the risk
risk matrix what do I mean by that well
if you&#39;re dealing with a Lockheed
man-made UFO that have these man-made
kind of cloned robotic things that
people think or ETS they call them
aliens that are those are very 3d but
they&#39;re 100% run by covert military
intelligence and corporate programs
which is what the stock-in-trade of
ufology is all about and the
disinformation Nexus there so you know
abductions mutilations
this and that the actual interstellar x&#39;
ETS
this is another reality and it gets
confused and conflated deliberately for
people who want us to hate everything
that&#39;s et because that&#39;s how we get into
a next war interplanetary war in the
meanwhile when we&#39;re going out under the
stars and doing this since the nineteen
sixty-five we&#39;d have have had platforms
and in space that have targeted ET craft
but in those 50 years 51 years there has
been an enormous increase in the
accuracy and the lethality of them in
1980 it was in the 1970s a man that I
met and actually one of my military
advisors was on the board of directors
of his electronics company had invented
what are called neutrino light detectors
and what basically these do is that if
you&#39;re coming in from subspace a
transdimensional space-time into this
dimension and you&#39;re not materialized
but you&#39;re in the process of stepping
and you can&#39;t happen we&#39;re instantly it
can go from here to invisible to the
naked eye or even to most sensors to
fully visible but at that interface
between dimensions as you emerge into 3d
there is a burst of energy that&#39;s called
neutrino light so this guy had invented
a very sensitive sensors the National
Security Agency came in and seized them
when their national security order and
then they ended up on the National
Reconnaissance Office NRO satellites so
that when an ET craft it can be under
the earth it can be above the earth it
can be in outer space when it goes out
of its resonance field that is in
another dimension into 3d that is picked
up instantly in real time
every major fully materialized craft
that has appeared at a ce-5 has rapidly
had jets helicopters and sometimes
ground forces that are tracking what I&#39;m
doing move in and I don&#39;t say this to
discourage
from doing it is simply to say I&#39;m
wanting to be honest about the
complexity of the theater of operation
known as planet earth that we live in
therefore tonight you&#39;re gonna
understand why I&#39;m gonna go through a
bunch of images that look like artwork
some of them they look abstract and it&#39;s
actually ET manifestations that are at a
level that can&#39;t be suppressed and have
no danger to them or us when they
interact with us you&#39;ve got to learn
this get out of the childish idea that
the only way these civilizations can
interact is if it&#39;s a movie like closing
again the mothership lands and they come
and you shake hands okay so you&#39;re
you&#39;re the childish kindergarteners if
that that that is the least likely way
it&#39;s going to happen at this time no
this is going to change but at this
point in time we&#39;ve actually from when I
started the project to now 25 years
there has been a increase and the threat
matrix from classified projects being
able to create this net around the earth
and it&#39;s not just US airspace this is
anywhere in the world where it is a
threat one of the disclosure project
witnesses was on the peruvian Bolivian
border if you read his account in the
disclosure book I know nobody reads
anymore but if you read it or you can
see don&#39;t boob-tube youtube I&#39;m sorry
it&#39;s so sad to me no one reads but what
happened is that we under the cover of
an astronomy track station up on the
Andes the US military had a radar system
and a space-based system that would
track these et crafts and they hit one
that crashed near the peruvian bolivian
border and this marine guy was one of
the first people to get there he was
threatened with death if he ever spoke
about it it&#39;s all in our material and we
need to and this was I think happened in
80s or 90s it wasn&#39;t all that long ago I
think early 90s I have to look up the
date but
you know you imagine technology doesn&#39;t
stand still trillions of dollars spent
on research and development by these
Psychopaths results in increasing
generation after generation of
degeneration so when we go out we have
to understand that it may be that these
interstellar civilizations will want to
contact you purely in consciousness or
with non fully materialized
manifestations or with electronic
communication through devices like we
had earlier or a million other ways
that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna go through
tonight it&#39;s gonna blow your mind when
you see and hear this stuff or they may
in fact fully materialized now one time
we were from since we&#39;re Josh near
Joshua Tree we had we&#39;re in Joshua Tree
and one of these objects materialized
right over us and maybe it was a burst
of we were out in the middle of the
800,000 acres and this object
materialized and came in in a flash of
blinding white light so bright and maybe
about 10 feet above the group so bright
that everyone with their eyes closed
could see the veins and their eyelid I
had my eyes open because I can meditate
with eyes open and it was this beautiful
with and then right after that coming up
out of that plane east of that site on
geology tour road to go there if you
want came this spherical ET craft that
materialized and drifted towards us and
was coming and everyone looking that way
looking he saw it and then it vanished
within a few seconds a very low altitude
looked like a 747 very large jet at
stall speed came in over a national park
illegally and it was loaded with little
antennae green probes and antennae on it
came in with landing lights on right and
strafed the group looking for this thing
so it has actually up in the air now
here
thing I&#39;m the director of this project
globally interplanetary actually so I&#39;m
a high-value target you&#39;re not and the
reason I tell people you guys have so
much more opportunity to do things I
can&#39;t do is because I don&#39;t have any
weight I&#39;ve lost the ability to be off
the radar so in a way coming out with me
is wonderful but what you can do on your
own is get rid of the old doctor and do
it on your cell because I&#39;m actually in
that sense a liability and people who&#39;ve
been with me on these expeditions they
hear this they think it has to be
something out of an x-files episode by
the way the premiere of that&#39;s totally
stole all my work i I didn&#39;t see it but
I heard about it but I don&#39;t care
imitation is the greatest form of
flattery but what happens is that when
you do this on your own without someone
who&#39;s a high-profile character like me
these folks have assets but their assets
aren&#39;t infinite the covert programs and
so by the reason I&#39;m pushing this out to
more and more people is that they might
be able to keep a bead on me but they
can&#39;t do that to every person they don&#39;t
have infinite numbers of personnel and
assets so I invite you to come out with
me but I give this warning but I
encourage you to do it on your own
because really you don&#39;t know how lucky
you are not to be me I mean I&#39;m not
trying to it&#39;s no false humility on my
part when I say that believe me when I
tell you I feel that yeah yeah yeah yeah
we&#39;re never alone but this beautiful and
so they&#39;re always with us so just keep
that in mind and I know I&#39;ve gone off on
some tangents from what you asked but I
wanted to give the perspective of this
multi cyclical multi million year
process now my big concern isn&#39;t
millions of years ago or millions of
years from now my concern is really the
next five hundred thousand
that&#39;s what my focus is is well I mean
have to be right now but but the vision
the vision that and what I&#39;m that the
strategy and the knowledge that I&#39;m
trying to put out is for the next five
hundred thousand years and the
transdimensional interstellar x&#39; that
have a very big interest in seeing earth
human civilization develop who are the
primogenitor x&#39; of life on earth have
our backs and are with us all the time
so have no fear and do the right thing
it&#39;s beautiful maybe one more question
yes ma&#39;am
well yes perhaps I I actually you know
that this questioning you know could it
be that we have a parallel several
possibilities going on where we could
spin off into this new future and the
nutjobs in the insane asylum called
earth to just blow each other up
anything&#39;s possible
you talk about probable futures however
and that is as a possibility that we
could go to the point of no return
there&#39;s like when when when doctor when
Tom Bearden said and don&#39;t get me wrong
the fools may blow it yet and so the
tipping point of that is when we become
either too great a burden on earth that
it becomes a not a recoverable level of
ecosystem collapse or we go to DEFCON 1
and a big war that ends all life on
Earth or we cross this unacknowledged
red line in space where we become an
existential threat to other star systems
you know and for for our requirement to
make this happen in a way that&#39;s
life-affirming and positive for the
future we just have to have enough
people who have both the knowledge and
this courage to manifest it and this
mass field of consciousness that then
translates to action so it doesn&#39;t it
does some good if you just sit and
meditate but you need to also go from
the
meditative state into action that&#39;s
effective and that&#39;s where most people
drop the ball because it&#39;s easy to be a
take the intellectual and spiritual
bypass and to just being in the
headspace and not doing anything in the
world but we live on earth and so we
need to be compassionate to Gaia and our
fellow humans by taking very direct and
specific actions to fix this now you
know you can have a defeatist view and
just say well let the whole thing go to
hell in a handbasket we&#39;re all gonna die
anyway and we go to the next world but
that&#39;s the that&#39;s a really wrong way of
looking at it the way I look at it is
that earth is actually precious human
life is precious and the development of
higher states of consciousness in this
earth and on this plane is quickened
because of the nature of physical
reality providing the impetus to point
counterpoint to the beauty and ease of
just the astral field and the reason you
can evolve a million years in one
lifetime on earth is because of the
intensity of the experience here so in a
sense I call this schoolhouse earth and
schoolhouse earth gives us the impetus
to achieve great things and and within
our soul in mind that if we were just in
the repose and comfort and beauty of a
non-material existence might take
millions of years so the whole material
cosmos is sort of a launchpad for all
intelligent life quickening into these
other dimensions now you can you can
choose that path or you can choose
another one that&#39;s lower but that&#39;s
really that the highest purpose and
that&#39;s why I tell people life on Earth
is precious and beautiful and humanity
is precious and beautiful and these
interstellar civilizations appreciate
that they also appreciate that we can be
very destructive and so we have to get
control of ourselves and we have to have
good people who vow to put together the
foundations both in consciousness and
knowledge and
lg4 a civilization that&#39;s just and
peaceful and enlightened and that&#39;s
that&#39;s really I feel why all of us are
here today thank you very much
god bless you
