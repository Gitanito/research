  		              		Experience Description   

    In one of the war battles in the desert, our unit was subjected to a ferocious attack. During which,  my body was full of shrapnel.  I was bleeding badly, especially from my feet. Due to the intensification of the battle, I was not immediately treated, and it took me about two hours to reach the nearest hospital. When I got to the hospital, I was almost dead from loss of blood. I was at the lowest level of conscious. The last thing I remembered was the doctors surrounding me as we went into the operating room.  
  
  Suddenly, I found myself in another cosmic dimension. It was a strange place that I saw for the first time. I was in a place like empty space over pink clouds. There were huge metal circles spinning high in the skyscrapers, and there were two spiritual Beings talking via telepathy. One of them gave a command to the other, saying, 'Clear his memory and prepare a new body for him,' as it happens in reincarnation. Then I was placed in one of the giant metal circles and it started spinning. My memory began to fade away little by little until I forgot everything and no longer remembered even my name, who I am, or where I was. Then suddenly the one Being gave the other Being  the opposite command, saying, 'Bring him back to life because he has a job to do.'  
  
  Then I entered into a long, dark tunnel in which I was like light or energy and was moving faster than the speed of light. I felt that I was atoms, burning in the tunnel and moving at the highest speed in the universe. I felt intense pain from the intensity of the speed.  
  
  Then I reached the end point of the tunnel where there was a giant white shining light. When I reached the light, I felt absolutely comfortable. After that, I woke up in a hospital room, and the doctors told me that I had miraculously survived.
