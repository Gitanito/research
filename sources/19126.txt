you
right my name is Alan Godfrey I&#39;m a
retired police officer I was served in
the West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police
here in England
from 1975 to 1984 when in 1985 had to
retire through an injury on duty
but then counter to the closing come
took place on the 28th of November of
1980 myself and fellow officers six in
total witnessed a UFO three of the
officers worked in Halifax in West
Yorkshire two of the officers was in a
town called little borough which is in
Greater Manchester and myself was in a
town called Todmorden again in West
Yorkshire the incident took place
approximately between 5 a.m. and 5:15 in
on that morning the three-piece office
in Halifax who were called PC Howard
turn penny PCs John Porter and
policewoman Julie Baxter John Porter was
the dog handler and they had got up onto
the moors above Halifax to search for
some stolen motorcycles whilst it up
there on the moors the a front of come
in a weather front to come in so they
very low thick cloud when it became
aware below the cloud level was a large
blue pulsating ball it was doing
movements strange movements not one
would expect from a helicopter or an
aeroplane of the audio description so
much so the movements became so erratic
that the police lady Julie Baxter got
very distressed and got back into the
police car the dog Angela John Porter&#39;s
dog started barking loudly at this
object and there was something he sensed
perhaps the object then came down and
what we called buzzed swoop down and
above and headed off towards Tom burden
about five minutes later two police
officers the names I have not got with
me today I&#39;m air carry me when there was
in a different police force than
ourselves
I was sat up Blackshaw head which is a
moorland road in a public-house car park
called the white house it&#39;s up there
observing below them the town of little
burrow and Rochdale when they became
aware they didn&#39;t see it actually appear
they saw it disappeared with the Dean
actually became aware until it was
actually there they saw an object
hovering between two pylons so much so
they were both mesmerized by it they
reported these this incident to their
control room and one of them did a
sketch drawing of what they will of
witnessing it was only there for several
minutes when it shot off again in the
direction of Tom Madden out of
approximately five minutes later which
would be 10 plus 5 a.m. I myself was in
the police patrol car heading towards
Burnley a town called Burnley on the a
six for six I looked up the main road
which was I was traveling on and I saw
about approximately 150 yards up in
front of it an object the first reaction
was that it was a double-decker bus but
it was a split reaction now the less I
headed towards this object now as I got
close to it I got within about 25 yards
of the object and when I saw quite
baffled me but I thought one of these
hot-air balloons had come down that&#39;s
five in the morning and I realised that
this object was actually offering off
the ground it wasn&#39;t I could see I could
see him as I&#39;m sat in the police care I
could actually see under the object it
was hovering about five feet off the
ground
the span of it was taking much of the
roll go so it was about 20 feet wide
because they&#39;re all pretty narrow just
there and I over the top I could see the
roll amps
so I&#39;m estimating the height of the
object was about 14 feet and I&#39;m sat
about 25 yards looking at it the iPod
the blue lights on headlights as it
lights anything you can think of this
was totally blocking the road it was
diamond in shape it appeared to be in
two arms joined together the bottom
earth appeared to be rotating the top
earth looked like it was stationary and
it also I thought it had dark windows
panels that windows went all the way
around that was my impression but it
could have been just dark paneling but
the first impression out there was it
you know like a little limo has a
darting windows it just that&#39;s the
impression I got but it could have been
firmly what if I mean I was absolutely
gobsmacked I mean what really was
worrying well not well it&#39;s a strange
same whirring but the the bushes and the
trees that were the lying they rolled on
this side on the right hand side were
shaking very very violently as or there
was a strong wind blowing book
my car was pretty much stationary I
didn&#39;t feel any vibrations in the car
I didn&#39;t hear any noise it wasn&#39;t
written any noise at the tire here I&#39;m
watching the object I tried the UHF
personal radio that all police officers
carry on them while they do in England
and I tried the car radio which is on
VHS VHF VHS is a video in the VHF and
none of the frequencies I could get
through to our contouring and when I was
deciding what to do about it I thought
oh I&#39;ll pick me or we carry a pad a
clipboard with all those documents in
addition tickets and all this sort of
stuff
I decided to draw well us remember
starting to draw
I can&#39;t remember ever finishing the
drawing because at that time there was a
large bright terribly bright as though a
thousand photographers had all taken a
photograph at the same time and just
pure brilliance and you know that thing
you get when you&#39;re on your photograph
setting that blackness
well the net when that blackness had
gone which only matter of seconds I was
about 40 50 yards further up the road
actually driving the police go and if my
memory serves me right the blue light
wasn&#39;t flashing the other lights were
watching and I didn&#39;t tell my headlights
on although I was on dit I turned the
car around and went back to where this
object had been cuz it had gone and on
the floor of the road surface as have
been raining all night I&#39;ve mentioned
the weather front earlier on him but he
did stopped perhaps an hour earlier but
there also is wet through but not where
this object had been this there was a
whirlpool dry surface there was branches
and when I say branches I don&#39;t mean
massive branches I&#39;m talk you know twig
time between a twig and a branch
what I did find interesting about what
wasn&#39;t interested what I did realize
when this flash around I&#39;ve timed it are
we timed that I left the police station
at 5 a.m. were all agreed on that I took
a colleague down to the town centre
which again is about four or five
hundred yards that way from the police
station I dropped him off at a very low
conversation with him about he was going
to check that the shops in the town
centre and then turn the car around
drove back past the police station
another founder of the house overall I
come across his object
flaps there to maybe a minute to I mean
a minute is a long time when you don&#39;t
know what&#39;s going happen to leave you of
me so maybe two minutes but we&#39;ll
stretch it to five shall we so now we&#39;re
about five
past five there&#39;s a flash turn the car
around about a quick look maybe another
five minutes go down to thee but when I
went to the police station it was 10:00
to 6:00
that&#39;s why I&#39;m a colleague who had only
just dropped off a dunnage patrol and
was heading back to because we all
finished at 6 o&#39;clock he was heading
back to the police say when I called him
there was definitely a large chunk of my
life missing you know you recall
anything from that interval no it was in
20 years ago the even then didn&#39;t even
think about a UFO extraterrestrial
anything like that it was just what I
was more concerned with then and believe
this or not that that thing was blocking
the road it wasn&#39;t what it was worried
income from the fact that it was
blocking the road
that was my chief concern I know it
sounds silly now but that&#39;s how I took
the actual sighting I didn&#39;t go wow this
is a flying saucer oh wow this is from
somewhere from Star Trek or something no
what the hell&#39;s this doing block in the
road that was more important because
it&#39;s total nothing like an aircraft you
see aircraft fly door opening unless
you&#39;re a junk jet now this thing was
actually hovering and it was moving and
I suppose it comes in the classic UFO
unidentified flying object state status
you know as time as time went on and I
became aware of the other police
officers sightings it was a great relief
to me but you can&#39;t imagine what a great
relief that was to me because you could
understand being a policeman I&#39;m a
colleague&#39;s reactions within that small
community community that we have but
when I found out about the three police
office in Halifax and then months and
months later about the two police
officers in Greater Manchester what a
relief
not crazy I did see I told you I&#39;d seen
this you know you said I hadn&#39;t seen and
I&#39;d imagined a book I told you I had
seen something and then there was there
were two witnesses and civilian
witnesses there was a gentleman there
was a caretaker at the time and he was
the caretaker of a local high school I
was a Grammar School in those days and
he was he was walking across the
schoolyard which is on a hill the rolls
down here he saw an object come on go to
that silent valley moved to that side of
my lay and did that all up the valley
heading towards Burnley which is what
the direction I was telling there was a
forum at believe this I believe it not I
had it in all this there was a former
actually now a police station I were to
report a UFO sighting to the missions
and you send it on a telly on
teleprinters as we had thought in those
days so my report together with the
three blue selves in Halifax because
were the same division same Police Force
how reports went to the mission of
Defence within 24 hours
certainly for Jade there was of it
certainly the when I came on duty that
night I had to do a statement I presume
the other police officer did that at the
same time I know they didn&#39;t do with him
because I spoke to look and I will say a
bit certain within 24-48 hours the
Ministry of Defence in London received
error not report and I do know that
nearly 15 18 years after the event the
deny ever receiving that reform because
a journalist who was writing a book
quite rather ultimately defense and
asked it would be possible to view the
report of these piece of that&#39;s been in
the media so it&#39;s not top secret and the
letter came by he&#39;s probably satellite
to him in this book I can&#39;t say the name
of the book off without consent or
something like let&#39;s go and there lo and
behold is the the letter Rana mr.
defense to this gentleman saying
although they&#39;ve heard
Alan Godfrey&#39;s encounter and the police
officer from where she auction well my
lover
we have no record of it I was absolutely
amazed at what happened after that my
life just turned upside down in instant
probably a happy-go-lucky chat within
the space of six months I would put
through hell and I turned into one of
the most horrible persons you could ever
imagine you come across purely through
harassment stress victimization you name
it I had it he started very subtle and
it was things that more of an irritant
than an annoyance and it but it built up
and I can tell you probably the best way
of saying is he&#39;s telling for major
things but for every one major thing
there was 20 minor things
I suddenly arrived at plate a place of
work and I was told I was being
transferred 20 30 miles away 50 miles
away Wakefield I was settling my home I
was married three children and the
middle one had just been in hospital for
about 12 16 weeks with Perthes disease
of his hip and he was still in a
wheelchair and he would have been him
he&#39;s not now but he was in a wheelchair
at that time my wife had just had his
third child and I didn&#39;t want to go I
mean there was no need second incident I
arrived back off holiday and I found out
I had been moved
that&#39;s from Nana holiday not to
Wakefield but to Halifax which I could
get to and Sullivan the same outfit was
very very inconvenient the fact was I
hadn&#39;t got a car for a start off and the
shift pattern we work in the please will
make it totally virtually impossible to
get there for
for parade Judy quarter 6:00 in the
morning the the first bus that left Tom
burden I wouldn&#39;t get you there for
caught the six and one Indy follow me so
I had to go and I went
and instantly arriving at Halifax I was
taking out a public domain I was told I
wasn&#39;t to mix with the public I was in
cities my colleagues in uniform we ride
a stanley ride hospital longer haul it
isn&#39;t a general hospital at all it&#39;s a
psychiatric hospital at this time I
became very very concerned so much so
that I said to my colleague whatever you
do don&#39;t leave me here don&#39;t if I have
to go to be interviewed you come in with
me and he was absolutely wonderful
because he was fully aware with being an
ex-colleague from the previous police
station what had been going on all these
other things that are too long to tell
you about
so anyway went into this examination
room consultation room Kali what you lie
to psychiatrists setting from and a lady
sat over here taking notes and he
started off with the usual rate child or
than things I am the power green tall
that take too long but basically it soon
became apparent to myself and my
colleague that I especially came up with
we understand you you elucidate I said
pardon we understand that you know you
Walter loosen Asians and you&#39;ve been
seeing little green men and flying
saucers well I just hit the roof you I&#39;m
a colleague just whoa whoa he says
let me tell you something I&#39;ve seen one
and so a lot of Allen&#39;s colleagues in
Tomblin I knew it named some I did you
sat there with a jars down you know do
what and I said what&#39;s all this about
you and this is gone for an hour
what&#39;s all this about I thought I&#39;d come
here for a
medical examination on an end on this
innit and I told not the injury whilst
cuz it was down in these region I said
but not I&#39;m not injured up here I said
this incident that you happen to years
ago nearly two years ago I had a I told
him of the story then very quickly said
only two years ago I&#39;m pimping I was
working yesterday I&#39;ve got my own office
in the cells what so you&#39;re working
that&#39;s of course I&#39;m working I&#39;m happy
in civvies midday off what we was told
to check out your psychiatric state
ability because they feel that you you
know you&#39;re not quite whoo I&#39;ll say well
let me accept this as I just leant
across that I said let me tell you
something when you are going on tonight
and you&#39;re in your car have you come
across an object like I come across what
you&#39;re going you gonna do about it then
I suppose you&#39;re gonna ring the police
hook I said well I was the policeman and
there&#39;s nobody I could back up on when I
wanted back up this is what&#39;s at me and
she knew and she knew I&#39;ve been
transferred and she says um what&#39;s all
this about what&#39;s that you don&#39;t know
right you&#39;re being barred from police
station pardon
she&#39;s it they&#39;re talking about it now
your call so I called them or via or I
wandered over to her and I knew it me
because I&#39;ve worked with him for years
and I said well what&#39;s happened what
they thought I knew and I said no what&#39;s
that gone on and he said well this
morning well this afternoon between the
six to shift finishing and the 210 shift
starting they&#39;ve got all the officers on
parade together the two shifts together
and the olives going to be read out at
the night parade as well and the the the
order was that the PC Alan Godfrey had
been barred from entering Tomalin police
station is not to be allowed in unless
it&#39;s on official duty
when he is in here he&#39;s best courted
everywhere he goes and when there was
asked why what for
does he know because it could be rather
embarrassing very violent came in and it
doesn&#39;t know about it
embarrassing for him it be embarrassing
for us or why because things have been
going missing I stolen
now I hadn&#39;t been in Tomalin police
station since being transferred bar once
when I had to go back on a court case I
was involved in I was livid so much so
the following day I demanded to see our
division led and I asked him if he knew
about it and he said not officially now
and this is the edit our division hasn&#39;t
been officially told that I&#39;ve been
barred from police station although we
added it on the golf course the previous
day so let me get this straight because
you can imagine by this time I got
really really pissed off with what was
going on and so did you tell me this
straight you bein serious with me that
year was out of this division was
totally unaware that one of your offices
has been barred from one of your police
stations by one of your underlings and
you don&#39;t know about it other than you
heard it on the golf course yesterday I
thought he runs this division you
I mentioned the inspectors name on the
sergeant&#39;s name who address the parade
you know straightforward enough
questioning who runs your division you
all these two when I do
I said well but you don&#39;t having bath
will give them authority and this went
on so I threatened then solicitor issue
writ I&#39;m now giving you notice that I&#39;m
fighting back that the room is turned

do I am spoken to the press about the

going out to my locker and he went out

else&#39;s element up instead of yours cause
yours is it Tom Berlin so you must have

it so the implication here is that they
were attempting to frame you mmm
well is in implication that&#39;s what
actually happened at area 51 they have
security within security watching other
people there are other security people
and it drives them up the wall too and
it drives the employees up the wall
that&#39;s why they have it a big exodus up
there of some of the boys that work
there they can&#39;t stand the environment
up there because you can&#39;t do anything
you can&#39;t talk to anybody you can&#39;t
