 Nichols' Monthly.
 A Magazine of Social Science and Progressive Literature.
 1855-1857  Monthly
 New York, NY, then Cincinnati, OH.  Publisher: H. Watkin & Valentine Nicholson.  Editor: Thomas Low Nichols and Mary Sargeant Gove Nichols. Succeeds: Nichols' Journal. November 1854-1857(?)

 Mary S. Gove Nichols and Thomas L. Nichols began this periodical as they were transitioning from the US east coast to their water-cure facility and educational center at Yellow Springs, Ohio. The periodical was issued irregularly for the period; if there are other issues of the periodical, we are unaware of them and would appreciate copies. Notionally, the official organ of Central Bureau of the Progressive Union, the periodical is not only a Nichols joint -- Mary S. Gove Nichols' fiction and TL Nichols' relentless historicizing are both front and center, along with MSGN's letters to her subscribers -- but also a good exemplar of the radical progressive wing of Spiritualism in the mid-1850s: Fourier-esque communalism, free love and Spiritualism, in the mix.
