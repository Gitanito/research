    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Entretiens Idealistes, Les.
 Cahiers mensuels d'art et de philosophie
 1906--1914  Monthly
 Paris, France.  Language:  French.  Editor: Paul Vulliaud; Rene-Georges Aubrun; Albert de Bersaucourt.
  1/1, 1906-1914.  56 pp., 8 francs (10 abroad)/year.

  The journal was founded by Paul Vulliaud (1875-1950) and Fernand Divoire (1883-1951), the latter of whom was a poet and journalist and involved with Alberto de Das, Comte de Sarak and with the Bulletin des Polaires.  (He is noted as a curious denzen of the Latin Quarter in William Seabrook’s Witchcraft.)  Vulliaud became the premier occult, universalist interpreter of the Kabbala in the first half of the twentieth century(though he never received academic recognition for his work) and wrote notable studies of Joseph de Maistre and of the Rose-Croix lyonnais au XVIIIe siècle and an intimate portrait of the occult world pre-World War I (Histoires et portraits de Rose-Croix), finally published in 1987.  The journal was generally devoted to idealist philosophy and contemporary art and literary criticism but had significant contributions on kabbalah and related subjects by Vulliaud and Divoire.  Contributions by Henri Clouard, Vaillant-Couturier and Leon Bloy.  Noted in Mysteria, 1913.  BNF microfilm; BM Lyon; U Massachusetts (Amherst); Vanderbilt U.
