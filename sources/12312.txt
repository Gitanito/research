My heart stopped as I delivered my already dead daughter. I saw a beautiful light and my father holding a baby. I tried to reach them; I wanted to touch them both. My father shook his head no and said not yet, she's beautiful and she's safe.  I awoke to my mother pounding on my chest. I was "gone for a matter of seconds but to me it was longer. I felt at peace with her death and knowing she had people watching her. There were others behind my father but I didn't know who they were until later experiences.
