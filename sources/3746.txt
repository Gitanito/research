DIRECTIONS For PRESERVING!
HEALTH, . .
* * ,
AND ATTAIN ING LONG LIFE.
(Continued from my laſt.)
OF EXERCISE AND REST.
Friendly Reader,
WHEN I ſpeak of exerciſe, I include
alſo that of the mind with that of the
body; for theſe two are ſo intimately con
neéted, that they produce a variety of
effects one on the other. "To exerciſe the
ancients have, as well as the moderns, in- ||
deed ever attributed great utility, particu
larly in purſuing it with propriety, and
have allowed, that great co, ſtitutional
miſchief may be derived from its abuſe or
neglect. It has with great juſtice been

Nor, like frail man, tranſgreſs their proper bounds;
For ſigns and ſeaſons, days and months and years,
In conſtant periods every one appears;

quences it otherwiſe is calculated to re
medy; for when too freely uſed, it is the
ſource of loſs of appetite, great thirſt,
loathing of food, heat in the bowels, coſ
tiveneſs, chillneſs, rigors, and fainting—
and this muſt be the caſe, when we con
fider the effects produced in the ſyſtem, by
that which is judiciouſly adapted; as by
increaſing the oſcillatory motion of the
veſſels—that is, making their contraćtions
and dilatations quicker, their contents are
properly comminated—all crudities de
ſtroyed—the blood rendered bland and
mild—the groſs part thrown out of the
habit—the vaſcular ſyſtem ſtrengthened, by
which the nervous power becomes equable
in ačtion, and, contequently, the ſalids of
the animal firm, and the fluids pure. The
mind alſo has its influence; for though by
its exerciſe it may be made ſtronger—ſtill:
if not kept within proper bounds, it brings
on fatigue, and renders the moving powers
of the machine inert and dead. ' Hence
the exerciſe intended to promote and pre- |
ſerve health, ſhould be ſuch as is united |
with mental amuſement, rather than la- |
bour—inaſmuch as in the former, the mind
is exhilirated, will communicate agreeable ||
ſenſations, and give firmneſs to the moving

But want of knowledge often is ſupply'd
By impudence, and prudence oft by pride;
The bold and bluſt’ring ſtill keep merit down,
This gains a penſion, and that gets a crown; ,
If fair means fail, they then, by fraud or force,
If caſt in all, they curſe the ſtellar courſe.

From the general effects produced by
watchfulneſ; and ſleep, they may be con
ſidered as nearly ſimilar to thoſe of ex
erciſe and reſt, and may alſo be conciſely
marked down—as ſtimulant and ſeda

their moderate uſe, and proper adap

their abuſe, or exceſs.
PASSIONS AND AFFECTIONs of the
- - MIND.
Every man is truly ſenſible of the ill
effects arifing, from giving way to thoſe
variety of affections which we call paſ
fions; and fatal experience often con
vinces and makes them lament being ſol
prone to ačt obedient to their impulſes.
So ſtrongly do they affect the human
machine, that the moſt ſurpriſing conſe
uences have been known to originate
}. theſe ſources on the corporeal, or
ſolid parts, as well as the ſyſtem in ge
neral. There are innumerable inſtances
of fear creating a ſudden and powerful
action on the bowels and urinary paſ
ſages.

But trace the cauſes to their native ſource,
Nor ſet a ſaddle on another’s horſe;
We daily ſee, for each affecting evil,
Some blame the planets, and ſome blame the devil;
For loſs of credit, or for loſs of pelf,
But few there are will lay the blame on ſelf.

Containing variety of matter in proſe and verſe, part neceſſary
to complete a performance of this kind, part collećted or com
oſed by the author, for the initrućtion and improvement of
Yºh youth, or of thoſe who, in the humble vale of life,
have ſouls ſuperior to the opportunities given them, to improve
in the various branches of ſcience; and concluding with the
kind contributions of his learned and ingenious correſpon
dents, to whom he once more returns his ſincere thanks for
their favours and generous aſſiſtance in a work deſigned at
eaſt
l “To raiſe the ſoul by tender ſtrokes of art,
“To wake the genius, and to mend the heart;
“To make mankind in Nature's ſtudy bold;—
“Look o'er each ſcene, and mark what they behold.”
Of the ECLIPSES which will happen this Year,
18O3.
ITHIN the Revolution of this Year, the Sun will be
eclipſed twice, and no more. It is always of the Sun,
when but two Eclipſes happen, as I told you formerly; but
now I tell you from what Syſtem or Modus it is derived. It |
being obſervable by Aſtronomy, that when the Sun is cen
tral, and falls in either of the Nodes, that then the Full
Moon next preceding and ſucceeding the ſame, do always
paſs without an Eclipſe; and if it ſo falls out, that there be
------- , - - -- ------ tWo
18o3. On the EcL1PSEs. 33
two central New Moons, the one before the Sun's Apogee,
and the other after, there ſhall happen no Full Moon, that
can be eclipſed that Year; as the learned Kepler has re
marked in his Epit. Aftron. p. 881.
The firſt of theſe Eclipſes happens on Monday, the 21ſt Day
of February, at 5 Min. paſt our 9 o'Clock at Night, conſe
quently inviſible to us, and not to us only, but to all Eu
rope, Africa, and Aſia; but in the Great South Pacific Ocean,
this will be a very great Eclipſe, not annular but total. This
gloomy Appearance will fall upon them at Noon-day at the
Marqueſas, which is a Groupe of Iſlands in the ſaid Pacific
Ocean, of which the moſt confiderable are, St. Chriſtina and
St. Pedro. At the firſt of theſe Capt. Cook lay ſome Time,
in his ſecond Voyage round the World, in 1774; therefore
this Eclipſe will be very great not only at the Marqueſas, but
at the Society and Friendly Iſlands, which are juſt by, in the
fame Ocean. I expect it may be ſeen as far as the Iſland of
Owhyhee, one of the Sandwich Iſlands, in the North Pacific
Ocean, at which Iſland Capt. Cook fell a Vićtim to the Fury
of the Natives, with whom he unfortunately had a Diſpute.
The ſecond of theſe Eclipſes will happen on Wedneſday, the
17th Day of Auguſt, in the Morning; and, if the Air prove
clear, will be viſible in this Kingdom, when about a fourth
Part of the Sun's Diſk will be obſcured, as appears by the
following Type and Times. The Eclipſe will be obſerved to

begin on th; Right-hand of the Sun, towards his upper Part,
at 55,Minutes paſt 5 o’Clock in the Morning. The Middle
or Time of the greateſt Obſcuration will be at 42 Min. paſt
6 o'Clock; and the Eclipſe will end near the Sun's lowermoſt
Point, at 31 Min. paſt 7 o’Clock, apparent Time at London.
The whole Duration will be 1. Hour 36 Minutes—Digits
eclipſed 3° 12'. The above Type or Delineation is the Åp
pearance of this Eclipſe at the Middle, expeeted under the
Meridian and Latitude of the City of London, and with very
little Difference, will ſerve the whole Kingdom at large.—w-

A RECENT DIscovery. g
On the 1ſt of january, 1801, M. Piazzi, Aſtronomer, at
Palermo, in Sicily, diſcovered another Primary Planet between
the Orbits of Mars and jupiter. In order to preſerve the
Honour of the Diſcovery, as well as the Obſervations, to
himſelf, he kept it ſecret till the 11th of February, when he
fell ill, diſcontinued his Obſervations, and ſo loſt its Path;
but early this Year, 1862, it was diſcovered again, by the
Rev. Dr. Maſłelyne, his Majeſty's Aſtronomer at Greenwich,
where a competent Number of Obſervations are now making,
in order to ſettle the Elements of its Theory, &c. It is about
Half as large as the Moon, and One-third of the Diſtance be
tween Mars, and jupiter, and performs its Period round the
Sun in about four Years and an Half. It is named Ceres.
Ferdinandia, in Honour of the Goddeſs Patroneſs of Sicily,
and the reigning Monarch of that Iſland and Naples. It ap
pears as a Star of the eighth Magnitude, therefore much ſmaller
than the Georgian Planet, which was firſt diſcovered by Dr.
Herſchell, in the Year 1781, and is found to move very ſlowly
round the Sun, not in a leſs Period than about 82.Years.

This Quarter takes its Beginning on Monday, the 21ſt Day

Time the Configurations of the Planets will be as in the above

Broils and Jealoufies, and the like; and it is alſo much ag
gravated by the late great Conjunction of jupiter and Saturn,
which is now operating in full Force, and has been ſo for a
long Time paſt, which, amongſt other Things, ſignified Peſti
lence and contagious Diſeaſes, ſuch as Fevers, and the like;
which, I am ſorry to ſay, has been felt almoſt univerſally over
this Kingdom, to the diſtreſs of many Families, &c. And as
to War, that Scourge of Nations, at the writing of this, has
departed from our Coaſts and Land, is not yet ceaſed, but is
now dreadfully raging in the Weſt Indies, particularly in the
Iſland of St. DoMINGo, alſo in Turkey and Egypt. I wiſh
that all may continue well at Home, and that the honour
able City of Lo NDoN may continue in Peace, Health, and a
flouriſhing Trade, ſo that our impoveriſhed Country may
flouriſh again and again. The world is now poſſeſſed with
many Doubts and Fears, in which Holland, Zealand, and
Pruſſia, ſeem to be more than ordinarily concerned : Venice,
Tunis, Geneva, Milan, &c. involved into Confuſion by trea
cherous and pernicious Councils; Sivona, Portugal, Auſtria,
and Savoy, together with the French Republic, are moleſted
with inteſtine Diviſions, &c. Theſe male Aſpects do often
fill the Air with heterogene and obnoxious Atoms, cauſing
thereby much unſeaſonable and uncertain State of Air, with
Sickneſs and Mortality. t -
But unto God we will leave the Event,
Who rules the Stars which he for Signs hath ſent;
And makes them fight in the Defence of thoſe,
That in their God doth their whole Truſt repoſe.
The SUN's ENTRANCE into the tropical Sign CANCER,
which introduces the SUMMER QUARTER.
This Quarter begins on Wedneſday, the 22d, of June, at
11 o’Clock in the Morning; at which Time 17 Degrees of II
is on the Mid. Coeli and 20 Deg. of my is on the Eaſtern
Angle: hence & is Almuten thereof, and in a k Aſpect of

and Saturn, are on the Laſp of the Aſcendant, in the earthly
Sign ng, and within 12 Degrees only of each other. How
ever, I muſt acknowledge, that this is a more promiſing In
greſs,than the former, eſpecially to this Nation, by inclining
Men’s Minds to Peace and Concord; but not ſo to every
Nation and Country, for Wirgo is the Aſcendant of Paris, in
France, and likewiſe ſome other Parts thereof. Hence I ex
pe&t Broils and Diſturbances, Tumults and Inſurrečtions, &c.
for the Sword is not ſheathed in earneſt everywhere. I hope
our Government will be cautious, and endeavour to preſerve
us from a future War, at leaſt for ſome Time; for I do aſſure
my Readers there is ſtill Reaſon to fear." But, to ſum up all,
though there is no Felicity to be expected without Alloy, the
Contingences of this Quarter will, in all Probability, be more
ſalubrious and pleaſant than either of the two proceeding
Quarters, and the Produce of the Earth rich and plen
teous, &c.
The SUN's ENTRANCE into LIBRA, which introduces the
AUTUMNAL QUARTER.
This Quarter begins on Saturday, the 24th Day of Sep.

conſulting the Scheme, I find 14 Degrees of Y on the Mid
heaven, and 6 Degrees of Q. poſſeſs the Eaſtern Angle. The
Planets are all under the Earth; H and 2 in 3 in my in

Angle. The D ab II 2 et D H , et k of ; and 3 ; and

Heavens at this Ingreſs. Things are coming on with great
Craft and Subtilty, in the different Courts of Europe, &c. All
the Planets falling in the lower Hemiſphere is very remark
able! What are the Jeſuits and Prieſts doing of in the Courts
of ſome Princes? It may be truly ſaid, their Government is
the laſt of Curſes that can fall on Princes and their People !
Men of viperous and ſordid Principles will be very active to
inſtil pernicious Councils into Princes and their Miniſters,
with a View and Intention to undermine and defeat the good
Councils which good Miniſters endeavour to ſet on Foot, and
carry on for the Public Good. Some Enquiry after Monies

Thieves; much robbing, thieving, and ſtealing, all over the
Kingdom, during this Quarter and the enſuing Winter.
The SUN's ENTRANCE into CAPRICORN, which intro
duces the WINTER QUARTER.
This Quarter begins at ſuch Time as the Sun appears to
enter the firſt Scruple of Tropic of Capricorn, which, under
the Meridian of London, is December the 22d, at 36 Min. paſt
5 o’Clock in the Evening, at which Time 23 Deg. of x
culminates, and 22 Deg. of ga aſcends the Horizontal Angle;
the D Lady thereof in G of 2 and 8 of n!. The G) next
applies to k Aſpect of n! and D of the Planet H. Thus
are the Face of the Heavens at the Time of this Ingreſs;
whence we may expect Differences amongſt the Great and
Noble about Government; the meaner Sort quarrel about
Party Wrangles, and Robbers and Murderers are as audacious
as others. I expect the Diſeaſes incident to this Quarter are
melancholy—Gripes, Phlegms, Quotidian Fevers, Coughs,
Conſumptions, and the like; but, bleſſed be God, the Stars
ſeem friendly to Great Britain; in ſhort, Things would in the
Main ſucceed well, if Pride, Faëtion, Deſigning, Tricking,
and Cheating, were not ſo much pračtiſed amongſt us, we
might ſtill hope God would continue his Mercies of Peace to
this Iſland and its Dependences. And thus I conclude the four
Quarters of the Year, with wiſhing Health and Happineſs to
alſ my Friends and loving Countrymen.

An ANSWER to theENIGMAs, &c.
By Mr. William Waking, of Leiceſter.
Laſt year's Enigmas, without fail,
Are Fire, Spring, Cards, a Pigtail.
The Rebuſes I anſwer thus,
Is a Diamond and a Rebut.
Then for Charades, the firſt I ſee,
I dare be bound, is a Watch-key.
The ſecond on liſt I bring,
Is a Miftake, the laſt Barking.

An ANSWER to the ENIGMAS, &c.

A Fire, a Spring, with Cards and Pigtail,
To anſwer the Enigmas, I think, does not fail.
A Diamond, a Rebus, Watch-key, and Miſtake,
With Barking, I think, the remainder does make.

An ANSWER to the QUERY, by the Propoſer, Mr. John SA
vAge, of Green's Norton, near 7owceſter, Northamptonſhire.
They (Solomon and Iſaiah) certainly wrote them in a pro
phetical ſenſe, for inſtruction and caution to all ages and
generations, as the Holy Scriptures are wrote both for the
external and internal rule of our lives; and how is it that ſo
many avaricious and extortionate perſons ſtill perſiſt in ſuch
wicked practices? Surely the beſt of books is ſet at nought
by them, or how could they read the ſacred writings and not
abhor themſelves? For ſurely the curſe and the woe, pro
nounced by theſe two holy inſpired men, never was ſo much
deſerving as it is at this day. It is true, God, in his favour
able judgments, has cauſed a failure in the harveſt (or, at
leaſt, an unfavourable time to get it in) for two years toge
ther; but how far different from a famine, as many of the baſe
contračtors and extortioners at that time endeavoured to re
preſent it in all its horrors, from no other motives than
avarice and gain to themſelves? The firſt verſe (Prov. ch. xi.
and v. 26.) it may be juſtly ſaid, ſuch perſons as hoard up
the neceſſary produćtions of life from motives of avarice, have
in all ages been looked upon as objects of the utmoſt de
teſtation; becauſe, by refuſing to accept of a reaſonable pro
fit, they have often created an artificial ſcarcity, and driven
many families to a ſtate of want and miſery! The crime be
comes the more aggravated, becauſe it afflicts the country in
general, and, by gradation, extends its baneful influence to
the poor and induſtrious, who, of all others, ought to be the
greateſt obječts of compaſſion. On the 2d verſe (Iſa. ch. v.
and verſe 8.) it appears that the prophet here condemns
thoſe who, from motives of avarice, bought up the eſtates of
the poor, and perhaps took ſome of them by violence, in
order to enlarge the bounds of their own territories, which
could never have taken place had juſtice been properly ad
miniſtered, &c. &c. , - -

New ENIGMAs, &c. for the Year 1863.
FIRST ENIGMA, by Mr. John Coles, of Weedom.
Beyond yon bright ethereal ſkies,
I in perfeótion reign;
From whence our great Redeemer came,
To endure a load of pain.
---
Thro’ me he left thoſe ſhining realms,
And all the bliſsful choir;
To redeem loſt man from fin and woe,
And on the croſs to expire.
I induce each faithful miniſter
All worldly bliſs to forego;
To win men's ſouls to ſerve the Lord,
And to eſcape eternal woe.
For me ſome croſs the mighty deep,
Nor death nor dangers fear;
To purſue the objects they eſteem,
Above all things moſt dear.
For me ſome quit their native homes,
And balmy ſleep forego;
Traverſe abroad thro’ darkeſt nights,
*Midſt ſtorms of rain and ſnow.
I Sometimes

44 New Enigmas. Season.
Sometimes the mind I pleaſe and charm,
And yield it ſweet relief;
To others I cauſe it for to feel
Exquiſite pain and grief.
Yea, ſome I do ſo much perplex,
And drive to ſuch anxiety,
As to thruſt the dagger in their breaſt,
And take their lives away.
Tho’ I’m a mighty warrior great,
I uſe neither ſpears nor darts;
Yet can my amazing pow'r ſubdue
The moſt obdurate hearts.
SECOND ENIGMA, By Mr. Henry Swier, of Farnsfield.
In earth, fince creation, I never was loſt,
Althº' in the ocean full oft I’ve been toſs'd;
Expell’d from the water, behold me in air;
By men am diſcarded, I dwell with the fair:
Without my aſſiſtance you could not drawbreath,
And yet you will find my kind office in death.
Young beaus, nor the faſhions, couldeven exiſt,
Nor even a nation, did I not aſſiſt.
Jºſt once in each day I’m attending on you,
When the eye drops a tear while a friend bids adieu:
From wars I retire, yet am found in the tear
Seaſonians, ſay what’s my name the next year.
THIRD ENIGMA, by Mr. W.M. WAR ING, of Leice/fer.
What found diſcordant this that ſtrikes my ear?
What, war again! (Fate, be not f. ſevere)
Enough of that—pray, let us be at peace;
Phough of blood—let broils and diſj ceaſe 1
Whence

Whence comes the niatter, then, I can’t give o'er,
But ſtill muſt drench myſelf in human gore?
'Tis quite ſurpriſing ! yet it is my lot,
A tool to be, whether I would or not,
Amongſt mankind diviſions for to make,
And human nature ſhudder and to quake;
For with my teeth ſo very hard I bite,
That nought can ſtand againſt the unequal fight.
My birth and parentage is droſs indeed,
Yet ſtrive for to improve my humble breed;
For then I’m dull, yet in good temper clean—
Your face in mine is then for to be ſeen.
My body’s ſlender, am both ſhort and long;
Am double back: ſometimes, to make me ſtrong,
Two hands I have, tho’ moſtly have but one;
And very oft am known for to have none.
I yet am very uſeful to mankind,
As in the ſequel you will ſurely find.
Without my aid Saint Peter’s church at Rome
Had not been rais'd, nor yet Paul’s mighty dome:
To every archite&t I am a friend,
Aſſiſt to bring his building to an end;
Whether his building is for land or ſea,
It matters not—’tis all as one to me.
But, hold—I’ve ſaid enough to give a clue,
To find me out—ſo now, kind gents, adieu.

FOURTH ENIGMA, by Mr. Ben J. KEMP, of Farnsfield.
Globous my form, and ſmall my fize,
Yet vaſt importance in me lies;
My maker oft, in pompous ſtrains,
My properties and worth explains;
Deems me a bleſfing here below
To mitigate both pain and woe:
To bring the weary ſweet repoſe,
And on the cheek to paint the roſe.
The love-fick ſwain, or thoughtful maid,
Will ſometimes ſeek my friendly aid; B

New Enigmas.
But, ah! ye nymphs and ſwains, beware,
Beneath my garb lurks many a ſnare.
Tho' ſweet the freedom we create,
Some of us cauſe a different fate;
'Twas want of ſkill, and vain deſire,
That Phaeton ſet the world on fire;
So our falſe fame, or wrongful uſe,
A world of miſchief may produce.
Take off my head, 'twill then declare
What thouſands in my preſence are;
The reaſon, too, you then will ſee,
Why art and nature faſhion'd me.
While filent Night her empire holds,
And crowded are the ſhepherds folds
With flocks of harmleſs ſheep;
While undiſtinguiſh'd to the eye
The hills, and dales, and foreſts lie,
Iia oblivion ſleep.
But ſoon as introduc’d by day,
The lark triumphant wings his way
On high, and ſweetly ſings;
While the refulgent ſun doth riſe,
Whoſe earlieſt beam, thro’ orient ſkies,
My preſence with it brings.
By ſome I’m made the child of fear;
. For they, when fancy'd danger's near,
Will ſtraight for refuge fly:
When thus ſecure, they me create,
To ſee how matters terminate,
Like ſome ſtill watchful ſpy.
To ev’ry eye I ſure am known;
But hold—from what’s already ſhown,
I muſt appear in view;
Yet, if you further wiſh to know,
Direét, revers'd, the ſame I ſhow,
So till next year adieu,

FIRST REBUS, by Mr. John Savage, of Green's Norton,
Half a curious building, yet moſtly recluſe,
And half of what oft does the building produce; -
One-fourth of a chief in the Turkiſh promotion,
Half the name of a fiſh that is found in the ocean,
Two-thirds of a ſnare, and the head of devotion; *
One-ſixth of what always is found in the ſky,
And two-thirds of ſkill—theſe, when join'd, will deſcry
The name of a monarch of ancient renown, -
Whom, doubtleſs, full thouſands fore dreaded his frown.
SECOND REBUS, by Mr. David Lewis, of Belmond.
| A low wretched cot, with a part of the face,
And join’d a fond parent's heir,
You then have a maid, who poſſeſſes each grace,
And ſhines with the firſt of the fair,
In charms where kind Nature profuſely hath ſhone,
And accompliſhments poliſh’d by art: -
How happy the ſwain that claims her for his own,
Poſſeſſing her hand and her heart.
