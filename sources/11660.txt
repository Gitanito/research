  		              		Experience Description   

  I had a stroke on June 2, 2010 which affected the left side of my body. This caused me to bewheelchair bound. Later, I was admitted to hospital with uncontrollably high blood pressure. After a series of tests, it was determined that I had a block in my right kidney tubule so I was scheduled for surgery to remove the blockage.   

 At about 7 am on the day before the surgery, my wife took me to the bathroom and then I had the experience. I was hovering above my body and focused on my wife. She was running around frantically and I was wondering why the next next thing I know was waking up from my bed.

 My wife my twin soul I love her very dearly then and now.

   I was later told by the hospital authorities that I was proclaimed clinically dead for 2 minutes. The next day, I was taken to surgery as scheduled. At the surgery table, the doctor discovered that the kidney blockage I had previous was gone. 
  So,   I did not have the surgery. In addition, the surgeon told me I have 2 kidney tubules on each side. I wonder if I got it during the experience or before I am curious. However, the experience validated my teachings and realization of the Continuity of Consciousness.
