  		              		Experience Description   

  I have left my body three times in my life: 

  I hit my head on the pavement during a bicycle accident. The first time was at the accident where I witnessed people helping me.  I floated above the scene. 

  The second time was  in the local doctor's office. We lived thirty miles away in a small town with one country doctor. I was floating above the room in the upper corner. The nurse and doctor where attending. I heard the doctor ask, 'Have the parents have been notified? Has an  ambulance was dispatched?' 

  The third time, I was in the ambulance.  I was floating in the upper, back corner of the ambulance. The ambulance walls began to burn away.  I can best describe it  as watching a movie and the film begins to burn away as if the bulb is burning the film. Then, I floated out of the ambulance and above the road. There was a very strong, lighted Presence  there. The surrounding sky and landscape began to burn away from the scene and was replaced by a vibrant landscape. The landscape was similar to the location we were passing through, except all of the man-made objects were removed leaving  a pristine landscape. All sense of time ceased. I could feel the vibration of the ambulance on the road at first. A lighted Being approached me and ask if I remembered home. I replied that I did, but that I wanted to go back. The Being said that I would be met by my parents at the hospital. He also said that I  would  face challenges but eventually overcome them and that I would connect with him again later. I woke up after several days,  with no memory of the accident. But I did have a vivid memory of my visit and the host. 

  For some time, I had premonitions of bad things that would happen to me and friends. It was difficult to reconcile. I developed a sense of abandonment and threw caution to the wind until my first child was born. I prayed fervently to not have these premonitions and I changed my attitude. Fifty years later, I see God in all things and remember this experience as the second best gift I  ever received; my  family if first. He said that Love is all there is and to embrace life. I’ve had some heath scares, but I am not afaid to die. I am just afraid to leave my family.

  Bless you. It’s all God.
