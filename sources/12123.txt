When injected with the contrast dye, I started sneezing uncontrollably. The nurse informed me that it was time for me to leave, after quick scans were performed. I couldn't speak at this point, as I was unable to breathe. When I passed out, the nurse called frantic for the code blue team to be alerted. By the time the code blue team arrived, I guess I was 'dead'.  I saw the team enter and surround a person lying next to me; at least that was what I thought at the time. It never dawned on me that the other person was I. I was very, very calm. But I felt bad for the lady (me) as the code blue team struggled to get her heart to start again. I saw 'me' being intubated with chest compressions and the rotation of the team to revive me. I also saw my catheterization and everything else around me. When my heart started to beat on its own, 45 minutes later, I was pulled back into my own body.   I saw everything and related this to the code blue team later and they verified that what I saw really happened.
