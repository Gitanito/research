saw that he appeared to· ·be · of ·his ·own,..
age. and height. '. · }le.· .was· dr.esse·d - in :the .·
- 9 - ..
same. kind of' a robe he had seen on the
figure of his vision.. His f ea t~e s · were
clear cut., the face clean shaven,; hair
short and dark., while the face seemed
lighted by. the brilliance of the most
i:emarkable eyes Seton had ever seen; the.y
were .set wide apart below a· very.high
fore head their . color was dark brown.,
seemingly flecked with tiny go.lden stars.
The manraised his right hand in greet-
ing., while in a deep vibrant voice he
said, "Welco~ again :to ·the light from
which t~ou had strayed,. I., Theron., am to
"be .thy guide ·to the. pe·ak of the immortal
mountai·n: of mystic :fire .., wher~in thine
own l'lame flickers feebly." Seton ad-
vanced .silently and.clasped the hand of
Theron while vibr~nt_ harmonies of joy
coursed through his being.. Holding the
hand of_ Seton., Theron turned and pressed
a. small .pe_bb1e which was imbedded in the
rock. Between- the plaits of the· beard· a
sg•uare of ;rock . eight fe·et wide and ,ten
r~et high. ·receded for a yard and then
s-lid si1e~tly to one side.. Hand in hand
t:he tw.o., Theron and ·seton., entered the
passageway.and the rock closed silently
be.h_ind them. ·
. ·for., perhaps., a thousand feet they
followed the passage., then emerged into
a small room which to all· appearance., had.
np othep .entrance-. in .the center of the
room . were two,_low chairs or a peculiar
grey metal. "Theron motioned Seton to
take his place in one While he seated
himself in the other •. H~·.then pressed a
small stud. on the side ·of his chair and

around him. There.seemed to be a spiral
t?w1e
ting motion of the walls, ~nd a quee~
lambent light· enshrouded them for a mo-
ment and then, ·as suddenly as it had be-
gu,;J:~he i,1otion stopped •. .AS Set.on gained
control of his shaken senses he found
that the ro.om ·1n .'Which. he ~ad· f'irs.t been
seated hart· vanished, and he was ·now in a
vastly larger 'room which ·was' lighted by
numberless _globes. similar to those of
his vision. · Doors wel'e placed alQng the
walls· a:t ·intervals :-and towal"d · one· of
these Theron· le:d Seton. ·He opened the
door disclostng. · a . chamber handsomely
furnished in a ·sty~e that .was both &astern
and western. . "You arf= tired, rest here
and prepare y_ourse lf tor· that which · ls
to come," ijaid Theron, and silently clo$-
ing the door behind. him he left Seton
alone. Glancing around Seton fo'lind a
tray filled with fresh. food on: a low
table ··beside arf easy chair, across from
the. door a.str~atnof water poured 1':rom a
silver pipe into· a b_asin c~rved from t_hc
rock, from whence· it drained through "an
opentng .in trie bot tom. He immediately
refreshed himself with a cool drink and
after washing ~way·_the dust o"f the day's
travel ate of the·rood; then und~essing,
sank into.a soft ped to sleep for many
hours. · ·

by the sound .of a tinkling. bell and arose
greatly 'refreshed b.Y his rest~ Perceiv-

the threshold of

and enjoyed keenly the ·wholesoire. .preak ..

awaited ·the call that would summon.. hftn
for his discourse from Theron. And now
he found that the urge came with ..re-doubled
force, · and he procee.ded to the chamb~r
where the previous·· discour·ses ha_d· be.en
given. Here he found Theron a·waitii:ig :him
as usua·l, and as soon as seton had seated
himself, he began ·to talk of the secret
Cities. · ·· ·
"I have already told yo'ti of Sham-
b~lla, the greatest o.f' the seer.et c1t1es.;,' t·,
said Theron, but know: that it is but one
of. seven, though the head of' all. The
other· s.1x· are located in various parts
of the w.orl-d. · one in the Gobi Desert,
one in_ the ·Atlas Mountains of. Africa-.; one
in Yucatan, one at Mt. -Shasta f:n ca1if-
ornia; one irt the Hartz Mountains in
Germany, · and ,one in the far north of
canada.
"I am ·aware, .from my occult studies,
- 21 -
of. the existence of these cities,": said·
seton, "But if Shamballa is the seat of
the White Lodge, why is it necessary for
these others to exist?"
"Each has a -definite purpose and
work.," ·replied Theron~ "each has charge
over some £unction of the White Lodge in
that·particular locality. Th~ knowledge
o~· the· . s~ven .cities has been preserved·
1:n occu;tt tradition'. among all races.,"
said Theron. "The seven Cities of Cibola ..,
the seve·n. Cities or st. John, ~ll are
traceable t9 the occult knowledge of the
seve·n cities · of" the White _Lo.dg~. The
Ci·ty of Mt. Shasta. in· california 1~. not.,
pi"6perly speaking., a city, for there are··
only a few hundred inhab"ftants. -.They
maintain a smal.l villag~ . and_ temple. .an·
the outer slope of Mt. Shasta., put. their··
real city is in _the -earth beneath the.
mountains.· Near the cr(!.st of Shasta is· a.
la~ge ·rock which . hides the entran~e to
the underground retreat. Thi~ acts- as ·.·
an elevator and it is here that the great
silvery ship, which is sometim~s seen
above the mountain., enters. Miles below
the ·entrance is a· vast cavern,· twenty
miles long and fifteen miles wiqe and
about two miles high. It :!..slighted in .
the same ma:nner that S.hamballa 1~•. There ··
are·, ·at· p~s·ent, about three hundred and
fifty:-thre~ inhabitants., though or~g~nally
there were many_more~ .Their average. life
span is about two hundred and fifty· years.
They are not Lemurians, as most _people
believe, but, are descendants of the
Atlanteans and one of their major works
is to- periodically inspec·t · a certain
- 22 _.
&
•
place in th!:.! Pacifip ocean where. a large
group of Lemurians are imprisoned. It is
for this inspection that the. great ship·
i·f{ used and it . has been .sighted many
times· going out or re turning. 11 . · •
"The .. inhabitants of .this . hidden
city have other work to do, also. Chief
among these works is the preparation of
concentrated rods· of a certain force of
energy, which ts _pre_pared by the disinte-
gratio~ of primal matter from metallic
bars, this must be done without disturb-·
ing. the . eord of energy. n
· ~'The Temple on the puter· slope of
th~ .mountain is, in a way, an e3sential
feature of the underg~ound cit.y. It :!.s
there, that energy is drawn from the sun
to Qe used in many .ways, · both in the
underground city·and as means of protec-
tion above _the surface. One form of
ener_gy is used for the protection· wall
which surrounds it and also for the
lights Which· are Often Seen at night• II
."The city' of. Yucatan, II continued
Theron, "is one of ·the largest of the
hidden ci t.ies. It. h<.;1,s
.thousands of in-·
habitants and, unlike the city of Shasta,
is apove th~ earth I s· surface, though the
entrance is through a cave.. It lies in
a valley almost circular in shape in the
very heart of the mountains. The valley
in pr-ehistoric times was the crater of a
great volGano, but has for ages, been a
beautiful valley entirely surrounded by
high cliff's. The only entrance into it
is through a long tunne 1 which.. pierces
- 23 -
the ·hea~"'-t.of: one of the surrounding moun•
:t-ains. · The entrance is guarded at all
:t-imes, ·though it would be almost 1mposs1 ...
ble to find. because of .the narrow can-
yons., high cliffs., and tangled mountains
on all sides. Leading from the tunnel is
a b_ea~t~..fµl white :road ending in a small
teinple .one .mile from ·the entrance • · The

his discourse. · · ·
"Tooay I shall tell you _of one ot
the greatest barriers in . the way of
- 50 -·
occult development; a barrier which is a
barrier only be.cause man lacks control
of it. This barrier · is 'the emotions.·
They hinae·r man in his development: be- -
cause they often neira=te ··his .powers of
reason, and when reason is quelled the
emotions have·-full· sway. 11:·
: '.'In his present degree.· ·ot a·evelop-
ment man is more or less a prey . to.:his
emotions. In every moment of weakness
the emotions pounce upon his mind and he
loses his sense of proportion and does
things that he would never do.it reason
were in the ascept1ent." ·.

T~E CHE LA

· The next morning Seton awoke early
and arose prepared to eat, .but observe~
that contrary to custom no food hao been
left for him ciuring the night. soon the
call came and he left the room to pro-
ceed, perhaps, for the last time to the
room where Theron gave his discourses.
As he opened the door he found the blue
light gone and instea.a a beautiful white
glow shot through.with streamers of pale
violet·. filieo the room. Th~ron was
se·ated in his customary place, but besioe
.hlm·· was. placed another chair and in it
was
·another man who was dresserl in robes
. ·ot· purest white trimmed in violet. Seem-
·.ingly he .was a .man of forty years, he was
fair·of hair ann had piercing blue eyes.
He ..sat i:_nperfect stillness gazine in-
ten·tly a.t·. seton .
. ; .
Theron motioned Seton to seat and
began: ... _"My.son, yesterrlay you were dis-
.. appointed , whe.n I _told you that toiiay I
woulq g':Lveyou :the 1~s t discourse. You
thought that· in some manner you had
failed yet diii not question. Le.t me put
your min_d at rest, _you have not :tailed,
·': ·you will ·.receive no ·more discourses here,
'but ·are to be a-dmitte,; to certain .inner
se ere ts,·. which only the ini tia tea . may
know·. My work still lies here, but when
you have b'een taught your work in · the
world, return to me as my chela. Before
you depart on your journey I will tell
you of what a chela's duties consist;
- 54 -
the chela, '!tJhen confronted with a prob-
lem, must always use his reason and thus
keep his poise._·. Only thus may he be
founo worthy to enter the inner mysteries
which have exis·ted s.ince the be ginning
of time. He ·must have c.onquered fear,
for fear erects.barriers which the chela
must have e 1imlna te d • .' .He ·must .have mas-
tererl ·emo'tiqh for only thus can he be
free' of the. bondage ·which -holris man en-
thralle.<i. He ·must be obedient., for only
thus can ·he b~ shown through plane-s un-
known to him.. He must know how ,t.o be
Si.lent," for he Who·would ·:rece:l,.ve secrets
must know· how to preserve them. ·. Only
thus. can the :wisrJom· teachings .be .pre-
serve<1 to the worlii. He must be unafraid
of weal th or poverty., sickness orheal th,
life or death, ··the opinions ·of those
arounr1 him o·r the scorn of those . that
call themselves fr.lends •. He must be will-
ing to· serve in any capacity in which he
is neerien., even though it be the humblest.
His overwhelming nesire must be for truth
to reign and_ exert every effort. to bring
about that result. ·
Theron ceaseo f:lpeaking . and .. arose
anr'i motioning ,Seton to follow··m6ve.d to a
position in front of the wall where Seton
hat'! seen the outline of.a aoor.,·As seton
stood against the wall the other .Master
stepped to his sine and took him by the
hann.
11This is the last we shall meet for
