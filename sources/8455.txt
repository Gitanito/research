    Book Review by&nbsp; Dave Woods    	This is Dave Woods.&nbsp; I'm sure that you   	remember me for my Soulmate Poem for Janet &quot;My Spirit Will Always Find   	Yours&quot;.    	&nbsp;    	From your Newest NDE'S I read Ron   	Kruger's NDE, and I bought his book &quot;A Higher Good&quot; from Publish America.&nbsp;   	This is an invaluable book, and I've already bought two more copies.&nbsp; You   	should do everything in your power to promote it.&nbsp; I say this because I know   	that you want the spiritual consciousness indicated by the NDE to spread   	across the entirety of Mankind.    	&nbsp;    	In NDE's some people are told that   	they must go back.&nbsp; Some are told that they have an important mission to   	accomplish back on Earth.&nbsp; However, it's always true that they have to   	discover what that mission is by themselves upon their return.&nbsp;       	&nbsp;    	Ron Kruger is someone who experienced   	the other side as fully as he was allowed to stay.&nbsp; He's also someone who   	was damaged by organized religion in his early youth, but after his NDE and   	his newfound knowledge, went totally on his own spiritual path.    	&nbsp;    	At Last..... we have someone who's had   	the full spiritual impact of the truth of the other side, to give us a deep   	penetrating and wise view of the human condition here in time space.&nbsp; Ron   	Kruger has fulfilled his mission.    	&nbsp;    	A Higher Good shows us all how to   	search our innermost selves and unlock the chains that keep us from evolving   	spiritually.&nbsp; It also exposes the pitfalls of our societies that we fall   	prey to.&nbsp; I have benefited greatly from A Higher Good.
  &nbsp;    	I can see myself more clearly than   	ever before, and as I keep reading it, my clarity expands and deepens. If I   	can fulfill the realities that A Higher Good reveals to us all, maybe I'll   	make it this time around.&nbsp; Please Review and Promote A Higher Good by Ron   	Kruger.    	&nbsp;    	Dave Woods&nbsp;&nbsp;   	  	www.musictolight.org
