      This page contains 834 near-death experiences (NDEs) and their responses  to a series of NDERF survey questions &ldquo;The following questions are about  changes in your life that might have occurred after your experience.&rdquo; For each  concept, near-death experiencers (NDErs) were asked to select the best response  expressing their beliefs before their NDEs, and at the time they shared their  NDEs with NDERF.

  Existence of God
  Existence of an Afterlife
  Fear of death
  Meaning and significance of our earthly lives
  Compassion toward others
  Fear in living earthly life
  Importance of religious/spiritual life
    

Methodology: 

      Experiences were scored as near-death experiences (NDEs) if they met all of the following:

  1.  A lucid, organized experience occurring at the time of a life-threatening event so severe that there is unconsciousness or clinically apparent death with an absent heartbeat.

  2.  An NDE Scale score of 7 or higher.

  3.  Shared by the individual who personally had the NDE.

  4.  Shared in English via the completed survey form on nderf.org.

  These are NDEs from the most recent version of the NDERF survey (nderf.org). They are sequentially shared NDEs from November 11, 2011 to April 8, 2021. All accounts were scored as NDEs if they met the above criteria and regardless of experience content to avoid bias in studying the content of the NDEs.

    The NDEs posted on the NDERF website are edited to correct obvious spelling and grammar errors. As remarkable as the NDEs are in this list, please remember that they accurately represent the real experiences of near-death experiencers (NDErs) from all walks of life and around the world.  

  We strive to make a larger collection of NDEs that include creative expressions of NDE aftereffects.  We would be delighted to collaborate in this endeavor with anyone with other credible internet sources of NDErs discussing NDE aftereffects.

      This list is public domain and may be used by anyone.

  Substantial efforts are made to minimize the risk of posting fraudulent NDE accounts on nderf.org: See a more detailed explanation. 

  

    Even a brief review of the survey responses below shows that NDErs often have dramatic changes in their beliefs following their NDEs.  This is strong evidence that NDErs accept their experiences as real, and make significant changes in their beliefs.  We are not aware of any other single life event associated with such substantial changes in beliefs.
