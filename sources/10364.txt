  		              		Experience Description   

    Easter 1971, I was involved in a high-speed car crash. I was in the passenger seat, trapped upright by metal debris. People around me were shouting I was dead and I could not even lift an eyelid to indicate I was ok.                                     

      I remember being above my body, but still in the car.  I was fully conscious of all around me.  I felt no fear, and this kept me in good stead for future experiences.  The ambulance got me to hospital and I remember being on a table.  I was above my body as they cut my clothes off. 

  In October 1973, I was bedridden with a heavy flu. After a week, I was in bed and heavily hallucinating.  I was floating in and out of bliss that consisted of being in a nice place, where the colors are brighter, and senses more alert.  I was alternating between this place and my earthly reality.                              

                                                                                           The doctor was called for and I was admitted to the hospital with both lungs collapsed, only the top half of the right one working. In the hospital, they took samples and sent them for analysis. This took 8 days, whereby I was given no drugs, but continued to float in and out of this other world.                                                                                                  

  With a week at home and 8 days in hospital, I gained control and could float in and out of this alternative world at will.  I used to get annoyed at the nurses and doctors entering the room as my new reality would be shattered and end my bliss state.  This would consist of sometimes 

[1] the tunnel, which I liked, the walls coming in, giving you security and the only way was forward, a good way to treat normal life, don't deal with things you cannot control, just follow the light.                

                                                                 [2] is the room alters and becomes a scene, this all shatters, like glass with no noise, when someone enters the room and reality returns. One that stands out is a wild west bar scene, but I knew it was Australia. I was sat at a table and a saloon girl was behind with her hand on my chair, I couldn't see her but I knew she was there, we were close, several others were there and there was an atmosphere.                        

  The correct drugs were administered and there were further complications where surgery and a spell in Intensive Care followed. I met an American in the hospital and we became close friends.  He became like a surrogate father to me.                              

  Years later, whilst living in Holland, I was struck down outside my apartment clutching my heart and unable to breathe. I could not make it up the stairs and my girlfriend at that time loaded me in the car, went upstairs and cleared the flat out and drove us to England to the safety of the English Health Service. There were times we thought we were not going to make it, but we cleared Dover and headed for the Leeds Chest and Heart Hospital. Things now eased as we got there and I passed every test they had, they thought we were wasting their time. I then went for a five-mile run and was fine. 

  Months later, I returned to the Isle Of Man and went round to visit my friend Larry. His landlord told me he had died in hospital of a heart attack crying out my name, the same morning I collapsed in Holland with my supposed heart attack.                                               

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Male  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 oct 1973  

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Uncertain   Illness        Life threatening event, but not clinical death   Treating the hospital experience as the main event as I was in a state of otherworldliness for a prolonged period, that side of things I enjoyed, with absolutely no fear , what I call 'fascination override' but as three of us had the same operation that day and I was the only one to survive [ending in Intensive Care] I would say the medical side was life threatening , but with total absence of a fear of death.  

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Uncertain  Was nothing important I can remember events were not a part of what I was learning , even doctors or nurses talking, wasn't part of the big plan for me  No

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   Everything at a higher-level colors etc.  

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Before medical intervention  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     You cannot compare it with linear time, which becomes a fantasy, quantum time just 'is'  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       vision so much more intense, that upon return to normality and the length of time I was subject to the experience [weeks in and out]to this day, I class the other world more real I expect our reality to shatter at any time and will not be phased by it  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Hearing was not an issue for me, it played a small part, there was some good music with total clarity in floaty scenes and am left with a love of playing instruments, but in the overall message for me, it didn't feature as major as the rest  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       Yes, but the facts have not been checked out  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     Due to the large time scale, I have been in the tunnel a few times, sometimes I passed through to arrive in a meadow, other times never getting to the end, I was happy in the tunnel, I liked the walls coming in, I felt secure  

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Just brighter than we are used to, when we say brighter, I would say its more real is a better word  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     The best description is that after long exposure the other world is more real than our present realm, the colors, sharpness detail, the just knowing, it makes our world grey, for want of a better world  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Total love and bliss, left with absolutely no fear of death  

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     I understood Quantum reality in an instant, years before I read up on Heisenberg  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No     past events did not seem important, it was not an entertainment show for me, it seems more a lesson in personal development in my case, it's something I just know, it's a strange feeling to just know, a lot of stuff is not needed. I know, for me,  it is about spiritual development and I had to come back  

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         No     

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other faiths- New age   deep understanding of the spiritual, quantum reality that always seemed to be there  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     re-enforced is a better word  

What is your religion now?         Other faiths- New age   deeper understanding of spiritual matters and the quantum  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     Its ok reading about these matters, but the personal experience you cannot be prepared for, like say childbirth  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     just everything finally made sense  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     The Australian weld west story mentioned earlier, various others but sketchy and in bits, battle scenes riding a horse etc.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     A just knowing thing again, a great awareness of what I now know through Quantum reality  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   That the world we know is an illusion, it can shatter, like glass with no noise in front of your eyes and expose a deeper reality and return the other way when, say a nurse brings you some fresh juice in. Try explaining that to her, now that's the hard bit and you would end up with a sedative needle in your butt.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Uncertain     once again, not in my script , maybe we are not meant to know too much otherwise ,there's not much point in being here , I am happy with that, to learn what I need for this life  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     once again, it was a just knowing thing  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes    Total, we need a new word for love, it's the all-encompassing energy field  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     just knowing, made all the pieces fit  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   you are beyond that, you just know, even what's behind you  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  It is because they were important events and stand out . Some normal events are the same, like the birth of your children, it is the importance you place on them, some forget the day to put the trash out  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     not so much as gifts, but using your instincts with confidence and trusting them 100%  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Just the depth and confidence  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Uncertain    You have to be careful with this one, I am very select as to I share with, the worst are the ones that rant 'I've had loads of them and reel off some newspaper rubbish and of course 'were you on drugs at the time?' It has to be handled by qualified people to maintain credibility  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   The minor one in the car crash listed, I kept it to the main hospital one as it went on for weeks  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I was never in doubt, I have always lived in the moment, there you observe clinically and cannot be in doubt  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Same again, never wavered  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Small flashbacks, the hardest part is trying to reproduce them, they will come if the situation arises  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I feel it was for a reason more than an experience to have, I have yet to find the reason, other events have led up to this point, so I hope I can work it out when it appears. In any situation, you are faced with tasks, some painful, along the way you meet some good person and that's all you remember, I tend now not to focus on the pain, but look straight off for the good people  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         You seem to have it covered
