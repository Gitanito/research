hello everyone this is Dr Stephen Greer
and Welcome to our YouTube channel it&#39;s
a very special event uh regarding uh
plans at the disclosure project is
making uh that I think you&#39;ll be very
interested in here and I&#39;m very
privileged to have on with us uh an
attorney Derek Garcia thank you Derek
thank you Dr Greer it&#39;s very good to be
here
and you know Derek was a young student
when he got involved with what we were
doing uh with the disclosure project
back in 2000 2001
I think you were at Wesleyan if I
remember correctly and he since has
become an attorney doing uh public
interest law generally I believe and has
helped us with some matters over the
years and he&#39;s just a wonderful person
and he is heading up an effort that is
history making in many ways I first want
to just introduce the idea of of why
we&#39;re we&#39;re going to do this in a moment
but first Derek if you could just tell
everyone you know your background and
how you got involved and just a little
bit about yourself would be great
sure thank you very much uh yes my name
is Derek Garcia I&#39;m a civil rights
attorney from New Mexico I&#39;ve been in
practice approximately 13 years both in
state and federal courts admitted to
practice in both the federal district of
New Mexico as well as the United States
courts of appeals for the 10th circuits
and the United States Supreme Court and
have done a variety of plaintiff&#39;s civil
rights cases surrounding constitutional
law search and seizure cases brought
under the fourth amendment in addition
to a variety of criminal defense
environmental law and intellectual
property law as well as related to this
subject and it&#39;s great to be here and I
look forward to speaking about our
upcoming legal efforts
right so the big announcement here as
you see from the headline on this
YouTube uh breaking news is that for
some time since the late 1990s I&#39;ve
spoken with constitutional attorneys
since before uh Mr Garcia was actually
an attorney about the civilian
application of the Ricoh statute so rag
Rico stands for racketeering influence
corrupt organization
and it was put in place some decades ago
uh as a way to pursue or obviously
racketeering a corrupt organization
referring to a criminal organizations
crime families and things of this sort
but in a sense all criminal conspiracies
of that fall under certain categories
and it was mentioned to me back in the
1990s that in fact the late 1990s that
the criminal conduct
of the organizations who are running
Hoover programs related to UFOs and
extraterrestrial intelligence and their
Associated Technologies would fall under
this statute and that at some point a
civilian group could organize and then
initiate uh without the federal
government doing so initially a civilian
Rico action meaning that we the
disclosure project and all of us would
begin a process to prosecute in a sense
or Sue and a civilian
application that&#39;s allowed by law of the
Ricoh statute the major corporations and
the government agencies that have
illegally run projects since the late
1950s and uh that then this would open
the door for us to be able to
involve under oath testimony depositions
subpoenas and to enter into sites uh
that had been run illegally the key
Point here is that we would have to
prove which we can do now through
testimony and information we have that
both corporate and agencies within the
U.S government have run these projects
without the oversight of the president
and approval or the Congress which is
required by law and therefore they are
criminal activities and organizations
and that they run the gamut from murder
kidnapping drug running
embezzlement of federal funds
um
and a host of other major felonies so we
have known this for a very long time and
in conversations recently with with Mr
Garcia we&#39;ve concluded that we need to
begin that process and so we are
announcing and making a call for
attorneys as well as other supporters to
assist us in this effort so Derek if you
want to just go a little more into since
you&#39;re a lawyer you certainly know the
statutes better than I do I want to give
people sort of the big picture of what
we&#39;re doing and the foundation for it
the foundation of it again is that we
can prove in a federal court that these
programs have been run illegally and
unconstitutionally and have engaged in
criminal Behavior I should add in the
last two months I have had multiple top
secret whistleblowers who have had
witnessed tampering intimidation threats
that have been uh pushed their way so
this is another crime to add to the
other list there&#39;s a very long list of
criminal activity which we would uh
claim and actually could prove in a
court of law
that&#39;s precisely right from everything
and I&#39;ve seen from your work over the
years uh is that we have more than
enough evidence at this point it&#39;s
approved in a court of law that this
illegal Enterprise this corrupt
organization exists and has existed for
a number of decades and not only that
has been involved in what the law
defines as racketeering activity a long
list of enumerated crimes which we are
empowered through the racketeering
influence and corrupt organization Act
of 1970 to essentially enforce civilly
through the federal court system through
uh force of civil law uh the initial
intention you know the law was created
in 1970 to prevent union busting and
sort of organized crime activity from
taking over
um you know democratic practices and
electing you know Union representatives
and that sort of thing but in this
contexts in the biggest story of human
history which the disclosure project
represents I think it can be used
effectively to essentially
um civilly prosecute
a number of uh enumerated crimes which
can we can prove in a court of law that
uh this racketeering influenced corrupt
organization has participated in for a
number of years
um
the only standing requirement that I can
see from the law and my familiarity in
practice in this area is that a citizen
must bring a civil action under the RICO
Act
if the organization or the individual
has been
uh harmed in some way by the corrupt and
criminal organizations illegal
activities and from everything that I
know from your work over the past 30
years in this area uh we certainly meet
that definition and so this is a call
for a national uh call to action and
invitation to begin the process of just
of assembling a multi-jurisdictional
legal team in which we will bring
attorneys together of all sorts of
different experience areas uh practice
areas in order to pursue these claims in
in federal court across various
jurisdictions as well as to gain access
to some of the unacknowledged special
access projects that we are familiar
with and to uh and to act on the
actionable intelligence that you have
already provided the members of Congress
for decades now so it&#39;s a very exciting
time and we&#39;re doing this call out for
anyone one with experience in
constitutional law National Security
Foreign Relations space law and policy
intelligence security clearances related
legal matters uh any sort of
whistleblower protection act
statutes and enforcements of that area
of law uh Rico actions including you
know the civilian uh enforcement of the
criminal code
legislative law and policies surrounding
the National Defense authorization act
uh of 2023
um includes the current Pentagon efforts
uh to study the UAP phenomena although
uh as we know for anyone that&#39;s been
following the disclosure projects as I
have since at least May 2001 uh that uh
this testimony has already been
substantially developed
um you know going back right and I want
to add that what has been added to our
uh let&#39;s call it a group of
whistleblowers which initially numbered
when I was doing things providing
information to the Clinton
Administration and the director of the
CIA was the numbered only maybe a
handful or a dozen and by 1995 it was a
couple dozen at the cinema Retreat
Center that we organized in 95 with a
number of whistleblowers from different
walks of life
um that was a private Gathering and by
the time we did the national Press Club
again event in 2001 we had several
hundred now I have a list of pushing a
thousand names of people that I have uh
information on or who I have debriefed
many of them want to come forward some
would be what I call uncooperating or
hostile Witnesses but if they get a
subpoena they have to comply with the
subpoena and uh you know it&#39;s not like
they would have a choice and some of the
people on that list would be the Who&#39;s
Who and the corporate and higher reaches
of this hybrid military-industrial
entity that Eisenhower talked about that
I know for a fact act have been involved
let me let me give you an example
although the the offending party is dead
but not the person who was the victim
back in the day when we were getting all
this material and this is the bombshell
that you will see at the national Press
Club event at the conference on June
10th and 12th in Washington
a man who is a a renowned Hollywood
figure who I will not name right now
uh was with the uh then soon
ex-president uh Bill Clinton
and another major celebrity
at uh in a limousine and he asked about
this issue
and the president President Clinton said
and we have his written statement now
that came in on yesterday
that the president said well
I was told just a little bit of
information
and but
the former director of the CIA and
former President George H.W bush
approached him and said this is none of
your business
you&#39;re just the president and you are
not to look into this any further
uh you know and now that is headline
news what I just said now we have two
witnesses to this that can be subpoenaed
one the Hollywood figure another the
celebrity star that he was working with
now why is that important because I knew
at the time
and I was told explicitly
that the president wanted to pursue this
but that he was in fact waived off
and I eventually heard that he was only
waived off but then induced
through let&#39;s call it briberies and what
have you to not further look into and
pursue this matter
now this kind of corruption at the
highest levels of the presidency
which has happened multiple times I
might point out and other political
figures is also a crime
and you cannot turn to the president of
the United States or a a person fully
vested on a oversight Committee of the
Congress and tell them you have no
business to look into something that the
taxpayers of the United States are
paying for and which is something of
great import to the National Security
I also want to point out that when you
start looking at who all these top
secret whistleblower Witnesses are that
are in our list these are being turned
over
to the key investigators for congress
the White House and the Pentagon
and so at the national Press Club we&#39;re
going to make it quite clear that the
U.S government now has everything they
need to pursue this and get to the
bottom of it and correct this crisis
one of the other
items that we would be
clearly claiming Derek which I think is
very important in terms of who has
standing everybody in the United States
of America who has been paying for oil
gas and coal or living with polluted air
or has had their economic Fortune set
back by the cost of those items would
also potentially be plaintiffs which
means 330 million people
could be plaintiffs to this in the sense
that
everyone who is currently locked in what
we call the Lost Century where these
technologies that movie is coming out
June 6 by the way this documentary film
are really have been in a very real way
victims our fortunes our health our
prosperity and our freedoms
have been curtailed by an unelected
illegally run group of people who have
viciously suppressed through all means
necessary including confiscation and
murder
technological breakthroughs that should
have corrected these climate and
pollution and poverty problems uh
decades ago
so you know this has the greatest
significance to the National Security
and the future or not just the United
States but of course we&#39;re in America so
that&#39;s where we can prosecute this case
but in the world every citizen of the
planet and I think that&#39;s where we have
to begin to look at this in a very broad
way now what damages we might be
claiming because you mentioned that
whatever damages are the the Judgment
can be troubled or three times what they
are it would be almost incalculable I
don&#39;t know what your thoughts are on
that yes certainly with this the biggest
legal story in human history and the
damages are almost incalculable you
cannot uh calculate uh you know the cost
to human advancements I think that has
come with suppression of these Advanced
Energy Technologies propulsion
Technologies which will solve
definitively the global climate change
crisis in our time and could have done
so decades ago had they not been
suppressed
um part of the power I think of Rico is
that the action can be filed both
against the individuals involved in the
criminal Enterprise right or in the name
and in the name of the criminal
Enterprise itself so it allows
essentially for individual defendants to
plead and hopefully secure their
individual release
should they you know believe that they
were acting in such a way that was
without knowing Criminal Intent
um by which I mean individually
defendants can plead that they were
acting with what they thought was
legitimate Authority coming from the
president or coming from the Congress
and not sort of uh derived from this
extra
constitutional group that we know for a
fact exists at this point and we can
prove in a court of law exists and has
existed for decades on this issue uh one
of one of the key people we would be uh
deposing and and providing subpoenas to
by the way
um just we&#39;ve talked about this Derek or
what I call the inverse Witnesses
they&#39;re the people who&#39;ve been involved
with the projects but there were the
people who legally constitutionally had
a need to know who were denied access
like the president or were threat and or
were threatened and or were bought off
and bribed and I have an extensive list
of these people these are people who
under any interpretation of the
Constitution would absolutely have been
read in or briefed on these projects and
this would include the president the key
members of the oversight Committees of
the Congress and I might add uh in the
case of of the CIA director I briefed
who was also denied access of the head
of the defense intelligence agency
General uh Patrick Hughes who was denied
access and and pushed aside and in the
case of the head of intelligence Joint
Chiefs of Staff
uh Admiral Tom Wilson who when he made
inquiries was not only denied
information but was overtly threatened
so those are all people who can be
subpoenaed to make the case that the
projects in question are in fact our
priori illegally run and
unconstitutionally run and this just so
everyone knows this is the foundation of
the disclosure project which we formed
in the late 1990s and early 2000s and
legally let me just summarize this to
you if you go to our website or look at
the book unacknowledged
there is a document it&#39;s what we call
the unod document it&#39;s unless otherwise
directed and my military advisor said Dr
Greer what you need to do
before you go public and bring these
people forward who will be talking
outside their coerced and illegally
obtained non-disclosure agreements and
security is
is to write a memo all the main agencies
of the United States government send it
return receipt requested which we have
and can prove it&#39;s in our archive that
stated in summary uh you can read it but
I will summarize it basically said
through meetings that we have taken with
key constitutional figures in the United
States government we have discovered
that the operations connected to UFOs
uaps extraterrestrial intelligence and
related Energy Technologies are being
run unconstitutionally and illegally
therefore
the non-disclosure agreements which
people sign the security Oaths that
they&#39;ve been threatened with are all
null and void they&#39;re vitiated they&#39;re
negated by the fact that those people
didn&#39;t know that they were working under
an illegal Rico an illegal organized
crime syndicate they thought that it was
something where the top down had been
overseen properly by the president in
Congress and we know that this is not
true
so basically that&#39;s how I convinced the
first tranche or group of disclosure
project witnesses to come forward but
even to this day
because of witness intimidation and the
threats of people losing their pensions
and the threats of what have you this is
a problem and it extends well into the
corporate sector I want to make
something very clear here there&#39;s a
there&#39;s for example there&#39;s a man who&#39;s
been reaching out to me through an
interlocular for a while
who is the chairman of a major Fortune
100 company if I said the company&#39;s name
everyone on this call would know it
instantaneously
and this man who&#39;s elderly now wants to
come forward but since his folks started
talking to me he has had he and his
entire family threatened
now
this is where you know and by the way
this man has the documents and proof of
this major corporation possessing these
Technologies we are talking about and he
feels terrible and has deep regret that
the world and and the humanity is in the
situation it is and he wants to come
forward
but through this Gangland thuggish Mafia
style
intimidation and criminal Behavior he is
still very much on the fence and
inclined not to so this is a serious
problem for disclosure and it goes from
the presidency and Congress all the way
through the captains of industry and
corporations so my view of this is that
this is not speculation we&#39;re this is
not a frivolous action this would be
based on uh enormous amounts of direct
evidence and direct witness testimony
um we have a thousand times what most
murder trials need to convict someone a
murder literally so this is why this
action is so important if
there&#39;s a big F
while we&#39;re standing up this process
the United States government meaning the
White House and the Congress finally do
what they have been recommended since
1993 when I wrote the first sets of
recommendations for the president and
then later for members of Congress that
I had briefed like members of the Senate
intelligence committee and the house
government reform oversight committee
all of these people I briefed and let me
point out also these meetings with
senior members of Congress on relevant
committees every single one of them were
denied access to these projects whether
they&#39;re Senate Intel armed services
House Government reform and oversight
even the chairman of the house
government reform and oversight that I
met with in the 90s flat out told me he
had never been told anything about this
issue and had been denied actively
information on it so I think that all of
this makes a solid airtight case
you know if we can find a judge in the
federal system that isn&#39;t also
corruptable or corrupt I mean this is
the the 100 trillion dollar if
yes uh I think uh I think part of the
power of a you know um civilian directed
uh civil lawsuit like this the
disclosure project legal team that would
bring
um is that the United States attorney&#39;s
office can use any evidence that we
gather as part of a civilian suit or a
civil suit and developed
um that including deposition testimony
that&#39;s taken under oath
um documents Etc if we gain access to
certain facilities
um all that evidence that we would
develop in this versioning legal effort
uh could be used to see criminal
indictment of any individuals who are
seen as complicit with and knowing in
their criminal intents along with this
criminal Enterprise but also the
corporations can be criminally
prosecuted I understand oh yes by by all
means and they are in many cases the
Enterprise itself that&#39;s discussed by
the RICO Act under the law for the
lawyer is out there and who may be
considering joining our efforts we&#39;re
doing a call out for you know pro bono
attorneys of every stripe and there&#39;s
going to be a link that folks can access
posted below uh that you can sign up for
and we&#39;ll get your name and information
as a number of years in practice as well
as credentials and a statement of
interest from you in working with the
disclosure project legal team but our
hope is is to have attorneys in Boots on
the ground in every single relevant
jurisdiction for this multi-pronged
approach under the law for the lawyers
out there under 18 USC 1961
the meaning of a racketeering activity
is any violation of State statutes
against murder extortion robbery dealing
in controlled substances which are
related to this issue although a little
bit more change
tangentially than the environmental
aspects of it
counterfeiting theft embezzlement fraud
as well as criminal copyright
infringement and intellectual property
theft which is Central to this case
going all the way back to the time of
Nikola Tesla in 1943 in my estimation
right absolutely a lot of his uh later
work in final work was seized directly
from him in in 1943 it&#39;s 20 missing
trunks are still unaccounted for to this
day of his work at the time so there&#39;s a
very fertile area in which we can
develop through civil lawsuits in a
multi-jurisdictional approach that&#39;s
going to require the time and talent and
dedicated expertise of a number of legal
Professionals in in a number of
different subject areas and if you would
like to join us you can also send an
email to
disclosure.legal
gmail.com and we will one of our um uh
assemble uh project members will contact
you and get more information about your
particular areas of expertise and any
other relevant information that you can
share with us that would assist us in
bringing uh you know legal Force to bear
and enforcing the RICO statutes
specifically directed toward this
long-standing secrecy which has kept
this kept this story The the central
Story the most important story in human
history from coming to wider
acknowledgments and I think is going to
be extremely extremely beneficial in the
years and months and head yeah it&#39;s the
future of the planet is hanging in the
balance and it&#39;s not a uh exaggeration
to say so one thing I want to point out
also I believe the statue also includes
things like money laundering yes and let
me comment on this because uh in so many
cases you all of the money it&#39;s a cliche
but it&#39;s some real truth to it and we
have a coming forward at the national
Press Club and at the two-day event uh
the the two days before the national
Press Club event on June 12th on June
10th and 11th uh a marine who was with
five of his platoon buddies who came
across a man-made
alien reproduction vehicle about 300
feet in diameter that&#39;s a bigger round
as a football field
offloading illegal drugs and weapons in
Indonesia in 2009. we have the names of
his platoon buddies he&#39;s coming forward
he has provided a testimony officially
to the Pentagon and he will be there now
why is that important because we have
other Witnesses who come forward
including a man who worked at a black
site CIA in Tennessee
who was also involved with that end of
it using these clandestine man-made UFOs
and involved heavily in moving vast
quantities of Contraband and drugs why
because it creates an all cash flow
which is untraceable off budget and is
not even embezzled out of the black
budget of the United States and Pentagon
but it&#39;s another Revenue Source the men
I&#39;ve been talking to who were at Area 51
and Wright-Patterson uh some of them
have called the regular programs that do
the reverse engineering and retrievals
of extraterrestrial vehicles and what
have you the Legacy programs from the
40s but these Rogue what they call these
Rogue operations are also going forward
on a parallel basis and are much more
out of control than even the Legacy ones
that are unconstitutional
and so what you have here is a
multi-layered uh problem where there are
extreme factions let&#39;s call that because
of compartmentalization of operations
and intelligence uh many of the people
who are innocently working in an
underground base or in a secure
compartmented information facility they
have no knowledge of the these more
extreme and murderous and criminal
elements that are doing all these the
drug running and how the money uh is is
being created we have a man who has
contacted me who is working for a
contractor at The dugway Proving Grounds
and he was explicitly told that all
transactions for the sector he was in
called Avery sector a v e r y by the way
all the names of all these basis sectors
locations are coming out on June 12th
the whole world&#39;s going to see it we&#39;re
not holding anything back code names
code numbers base locations corporate
names all of it
so stay tuned my point here
is that he was told by an Air Force a
woman there that all transactions for
those activities were a hundred percent
in cash moreover the corporate
contractors on a U.S covert base owned
52 of the operations which created a
means for them to maintain control over
the technology and also not be subject
to any foia
um requests or even in many cases
oversight so this I said for 30 years
there&#39;s a hybridized entity which uh
Eisenhower called the
military-industrial complex I want to be
a little more specifics it&#39;s a hybrid
criminal organization
with the that&#39;s part governmental that&#39;s
illegal Breakaway and part corporate
private
but the dominant partner is private
it&#39;s where the money is
and so this is another key part of what
we would be putting forward in the RICO
action uh because here we&#39;re talking
about not only uh blatantly criminal
activity that is covered under Rico and
now we have test people to beat
subpoenaed who will testify
but we also can state that even people
for example one of the key people that
I&#39;m working with in Washington literally
oversees and manages the black budget of
the United States meaning the legal part
of the black budget that&#39;s known by the
president and the Congress because there
are highly classified uh items that are
not enumerated that the public would
ever know however this person and his
bosses
have never gotten access to the UFO UAP
projects but now they know they exist
so we know that this is being run
illegally and unconstitutionally but
because of that
if you win the very first meeting I had
with these folks
and a secure facility
they said where is the money coming from
I said well
let&#39;s take your B2 stealth bomber that
they built the government for two
billion dollars for it probably costs
more like 100 million
once it was designed as you know but the
other money is goes out the back door
like a mafia operation where they have a
pizza parlor and all kinds of ill-gotten
gains go through the front door and out
the back is classic money laundering but
also embezzlement in this case of U.S
federal funds uh and we have a witness
who worked for saic who actually saw
this happening also
science applications international
corporation so we&#39;re talking about a
enormous the world&#39;s largest Rico
criminal organization is what we&#39;re
talking about here so we need serious
legal help and we&#39;re also by the way
anyone listening we&#39;re going to need
serious funding help because even if
every lawyer worked pro bono there are
going to be some significant travel
deposition
transcripts all kinds of other expenses
that the attorneys would not be able to
pick up unless they&#39;re extremely well
healed
um and so we need also people who
underwrite this uh action
as part of the part of the beauty of the
the RICO Act Act and the law in this
area is that um if we&#39;re successful in
bringing this information in a
convincing way that&#39;s ultimately decided
by an everyday jury of everyday people
or a civil jury in terms of proclaiming
very specific individual actors as well
as the criminal Enterprise to be
racketeering influenced and corrupt if
that factual determination is made by a
jury in the end uh it allows for treble
damages to anyone that&#39;s been harmed and
uh certainly you and your organization
have been you know greatly harmed going
decades back but as you point out we&#39;ve
all been harmed by suppression of these
Technologies right but it allows for
attorney fees and costs as well and in
being able to be recovered from uh from
the from these uh defendants
um and so part of our legal strategy as
we&#39;re developing it I think needs to be
that we name individuals as defendants
but then we give them proper incentive
uh to plead and to come clean that they
did not know they were were acting
or failing to act without proper
Congressional Authority or without
proper executive branch oversight in the
chain of command and that allows their
testimony then to be developed against
the true principles of the you know the
conspirators at the top of the chain of
commands and securing their release uh
we can secure their testimony and be
able to Prevail In The End by proving
that these uh This legal Shadow
governments uh exists and has existed uh
for a long time and uh it is just now
when an everyday group of people
everyday citizens comes together and
really uh pursues this in a court of law
you know we went to we went to war in
2003 on far far less evidence for
weapons of mass destruction than exists
developed by you you know for UFOs and
at this point uh as being
extraterrestrial Vehicles as as the
shadow government uh exists in a and we
can prove it in court now we have the
testimony we have the documents we have
the evidence we have had for a long time
and I think I think we will prevail but
it&#39;s going to require everybody&#39;s
efforts and a broad range of legal
talents so please please uh click on the
uh form link below uh send us your
information and we will be in touch and
contact as soon as possible and I also
wanted to ask you Dr Greer uh your
thoughts on you know amnesty to those
who you know participated in these
projects uh during you know the relevant
periods but may not have been knowing
actors you know in the sense that they
knew they didn&#39;t know that you know
perhaps they were violating the law or
perhaps they thought they were
maintaining a secrecy oath that had
actual
um executive branch Authority behind it
uh if you may comment on that uh aspect
well well actually those people are
already they&#39;re innocent victims
actually that were just like let&#39;s call
it a cog in the machine and they didn&#39;t
know who was cranking and running the
machine all right they&#39;re already
protected under the wall that was passed
uh for people to come forward that was
signed two days before Christmas 2022
and that&#39;s the basis of the witnesses
that we&#39;re bringing now and bringing
forward however I separate from that
we are recommending and I recommended
this
back in uh when Clinton was President
that there be amnesty for the culpable
parties who did know why because if
you&#39;re going to actually get these very
high value senior folks
to
um let&#39;s say defect from this criminal
group those whistleblowers who do have
culpability need to have amnesty so I am
actively working and discussing three
key things that need to be enshrined in
an amendment or a Bill in Congress one
is amnesty that you&#39;re talking about for
a period not a long period might be a
year or less
the other would be
explicit protection of people&#39;s
Financial assets and or pensions which
have been threatened and are actually
specified in some of these ndas that
people have signed illegally they didn&#39;t
know if they were signing on behalf in a
legal operation however and the other is
uh federal witness protection
or ones who feel they need it and this
is a significant number of them now as a
private organization unless we had a
very large endowment we would not be
able to backstop and guarantee people&#39;s
pensions nor would we be able to afford
to have a tactical security team for all
these hundreds of folks now the federal
government can&#39;t
so that&#39;s why we are recommending and
you will see when I do my presentation
at the national Press Club there will be
a set of recommendations for the
executive branch and president
Department of Justice and there&#39;ll be a
set of recommendations for the Congress
which I am refining as we speak today
and those will be very much encourage
anyone in my private conversations with
members of Congress and other people in
Washington I&#39;m saying this very much
needs to be done but this is where we
need the cooperation of the federal
government for some of that but luckily
the people with whom I&#39;m speaking are
extremely sympathetic to that
and realize we need it
for example let&#39;s go back to this the
very highly placed executive with a
major corporation who has the documents
and the proof of these Technologies
which brought forward would end oil and
gas and coal and pollution forever
this man obviously benefited greatly
from the secrecy because he was head of
this big Corporation he doesn&#39;t want
himself or his family at risk so he
needs protection but he also doesn&#39;t
want his asset seats which can be under
Rico
so there needs to be a way to
incentivize
because one of the things I tell
attorneys and radically eyed all kinds
of activists is that a an eye for an eye
leaves a whole world blind
and let&#39;s not forget the group we&#39;re
talking about have
more money than the US government better
technology more advanced technology by
thousands of years from reverse
engineering extraterrestrial vehicles
and they are vicious they are thugs so
what you don&#39;t want to do is make an
enemy where there&#39;s someone who wants to
help you right who is highly placed
very highly placed so this is why a
period of amnesty would be very
important and I think there will be
increasing political pressure
to do that when they see that there&#39;s a
credible
civilian group like ours moving forward
to take on both the corporate and
governmental end of this
and I want to also say one thing that
you and I haven&#39;t spoken about there
there are people highly placed in other
countries watching this I&#39;ve been on the
phone with people in London as you know
I&#39;ve met with and briefed the Ministers
of Defense of Canada United Kingdom
Australia
all of whom could be supporting
Witnesses not to the U.S situation but
in their own countries where they
similarly were denied access to these
projects notwithstanding the fact that
they should have known and the this
group we&#39;re talking about is
transnational it&#39;s Global and it&#39;s a
global corrupt organization not just us
um so this is going to get watched I&#39;m
quite sure in it by another other
countries that are facing the same
problem that are sitting on the
sidelines waiting to see what happens in
the United States since the United
States obviously is the center of power
on most of these operations
okay
yes uh I think um a lot of people have
uh difficulty wrapping their eye heads
around this idea of an illegal
um Shadow government has been used in
the words of uh Senator Daniel anyway uh
yes tell that it&#39;s a wonderful story
from when you were an intern up there oh
yeah thank you for yeah that&#39;s um quite
quite a quite an interesting story
um as we know uh Daniel in a way uh one
of the main uh
individuals responsible during the Iran
Contra hearings for
um reigning in Oliver North and his gang
but I think that was just the tip of the
iceberg and he&#39;s famous as for saying
you know there exists a legal Shadow
government with its own Army its own Air
Force its own fund record raising
mechanisms to paraphrase
um free from the law itself in any sort
of congressional oversight and a lot of
things a lot of people suspect that he
may have been uh speaking in hyperbole
or exaggeration but I know for a fact
that he was not and originally when the
original May
2001 disclosure project uh press
conference was released I was an intern
in Capitol Hill for both senators
mingaman and dominici the New Mexico
delegation
and I watched attentively
um during that initial press conference
and I had the um uh privilege of
catching up with uh Senator anyway uh in
the summer of 2001 in the Senate heart
office building as a young intern and he
uh I I approached him I said have you
heard of the disclosure project have you
heard of Dr Greer and his efforts to
bring about
um formal acknowledgments UFOs and
advanced technology and he said uh he
kind of uh
did this to me and caused me to follow
him back to his office where I had a
private meeting with the senator and the
senator uh confirmed to me directly that
everything
included in the May 2001 initial
disclosure project press conference was
real was actually happening
uh that uh that UFOs were
extraterrestrial vehicles that the uh
that this uh this issue has been
obfuscated and um
and uh uh
concealed from the public for a number
of decades and that it was all in fact
actual reality
um he was not speaking in hyperbole
during the Iran-Contra hearings the uh
the illegal Shadow government has its
own military they have their own
advanced technology he was highly highly
interested in getting to the bottom of
this but even Senators like Senator
anyway who never lost an election have
to be concerned with the six-year
election cycle in the Senate and the
two-year election cycle in the house
it&#39;s very very hard I think for elected
representatives because of the giggle
Factor because of everything in the in
the in the need to get reelected and the
need to continue fundraising to really
get out in front of this issue so the
the movement that we have seen lately
has been tremendous I think uh for us
finally uh finally after all these years
and 22 years later after Daniel inaway
confirmed to me personally that uh this
was all a reality and not an
exaggeration
um I think uh you know I had forgotten
that story until you mentioned it to me
a few days ago
um because you know I deal with so many
people and situations like this where
it&#39;s confirmatory to everything that
we&#39;ve been saying and I think you&#39;re
right I think for most people their
minds are just can&#39;t quite get
their minds around the extent of the
criminal and just the hubris and the
outrageous operations that exist to kept
the secret the counterintelligence the
threats the inducements you know I met
with a member of this clandestine group
back in 1993 before I briefed the CIA
director and he said look we&#39;ve given at
least 10 000 people 10 million dollars
each or more to secure their cooperation
with this secrecy
you know in my case General Albert
stubblebine who had been head of Army
intelligence and Special Forces offered
me in May of 1992 2 billion dollars to
become part of his team and be on sort
of a policy board and it was all
illegally ill-gotten gains from the
collapse of the Soviet Union held in
Eastern Europe is what he told me so the
amount of corrupt money and activities
globally on this is very very
substantial but I think for the average
person and you make a very good point
one of the reasons we&#39;re doing and this
is why everyone listening please send
the link to the conference the two-day
conference the 10th 11th but the
national Press Club event that&#39;s going
to be streamed by the national Press
Club globally over our channels for free
everyone can look at it you should have
all your members of Congress and your
Senators uh and everyone you know
looking at it because this is where
we&#39;re going to unveil the disclosure
intelligence archive that has all this
information the master list of witnesses
the the they&#39;ll be redacted in terms of
people&#39;s private names that don&#39;t want
to be known but everyone who does want
to be known will be on it and as well as
the entire collection of facilities
corporations basis project code names
Etc that we have and every two or three
days now we are having to update that
list we have so much intelligence
pouring in
so uh you know I hope all of you you
know get involved with that and the more
information we have the better so we&#39;re
asking for more whistleblowers to come
forward and Witnesses or people with
information that&#39;s specific information
about locations of facilities corporate
projects code names code numbers
Etc anyone with that information should
contact us immediately since now we&#39;re a
little less than three weeks out from
that event the other thing I want to
mention is
is that it&#39;s a very important
strategy this this event in Washington
that is been asked of me
by some senior folks in Washington who
cited exactly what you just said Derek
that the politicians who have to get
elected every two years or six years or
four if you&#39;re the president
they are very skittish about the Giggle
and the little green men and the
silliness factor of this subject so the
more we can put this kind of information
out in front of the people
because they&#39;re politicians and create
enough social and political cover and
demand
that they act so see this is how things
change people don&#39;t understand
30 years on of my activity doing this it
takes a long time but also if you look
at the civil rights movement that didn&#39;t
happen overnight that was percolating
for decades and and even the Kennedy
brothers did not want to do all the
Civil Rights bills at the time they
thought it would be politically
difficult but when the Civil Rights
activists including but not limited to
Martin Luther King and others created a
Groundswell of public and media activity
that put this on the front burner then
the Congress and the president acted so
what I tell people having been involved
I&#39;m old enough to be involved in the
early civil rights and rights for women
and rights for gay people rights for
everybody
that and then being against the corrupt
Wars that we didn&#39;t need that activity
and the changes that flowed from it
didn&#39;t come from the top down it comes
from the Grassroots up which is why it
really is the power to the people and we
the people I live here down the road
from Thomas Jefferson&#39;s Home Monticello
and that is what people need to
understand these things happen because
you and I and other people who are
concerned citizens
uh exercise their Bill of Rights their
rights and civil rights to express
themselves and take action because that
gives cover
and support to the members of Congress
who do want to act but they need to hear
from us they need to know we are
concerned about this so I think this is
the part of this that&#39;s very activist
oriented
um and it&#39;s not that I&#39;m you know
wanting to be a political agitator it&#39;s
that this is just simply how a
Democratic Republic works you know
people do have to get elected they do
campaign
um if we were able we would should have
a packer Super PAC that would actually
be the disclosure that would be
nonpartisan and by the way I want to
emphasize everything we&#39;re doing is
non-partisan 100
because some of the biggest supporters
of disclosing this issue are uh Eve
quickly divided on either side of the
red blue Left Right aisle this issue
which I have made this point for 30
years absolutely transcends the fracture
lines of normal
partisan politics and thankfully if you
look at the letter
sent to the Pentagon recently by 16
Senators that&#39;s one-sixth of the Senate
it&#39;s very bipartisan it&#39;s from people
from both sides of the aisle which
something this Cosmic and Global and a
great importance should be there should
be there should be complete non-partisan
approach to this
as I know you&#39;re fond of saying when the
when the people lead the leaders will
follow and I know uh we we will keep the
faith and I I certainly um I certainly
am one to believe that the force of law
the rule of law regardless of political
affiliation and regardless of whatever
has happened in the past and people&#39;s
compromised values in the past
um will uh will cede to the ultimate
truth on this issue and even uh for
senators like in a way who secured some
of the initial funding
um uh The Secret Pentagon program
um at least through the legal government
22 million dollars in 2007 working with
Senator Senators Reed and Senator
Stevens that also was a bipartisan
approach
um that unfortunately sort of fell apart
you know at the time of Senator anyway&#39;s
death in 2012 but I do know that he his
particular uh views on this issue was
that it is beyond any sort of red state
blue State considerations that we&#39;re all
oh absolutely We&#39;re All in This Together
absolutely in the end well and remember
most people may have missed this when I
I did a YouTube about this a couple
years ago I spoke to Senator Reid who at
the time was the majority leader of the
Senate his right hand guy on that issue
in the UFO issue was a general Herbert
with whom I&#39;ve spoken and he and the
Senators didn&#39;t know that when they
got influenced to put those 22 million
dollars into Bigelow Aerospace that they
were putting it into a cutout operation
of this criminal activity and what
general Herbert said to me personally
over and over again is that for the 22
million dollars they got nothing
valuable back if they at the most he had
been an army pilot he said basically I
got a snapshot from 40 000 feet which
anyone who would have read any UFO book
from the the Above Top Secret with
Timothy good or anything else from the
80s would have had more information and
he said and I told him I said yes
because the person who was the
consigliari and the architect of that
project for Mr Bigelow is a very
well-placed member of this criminal
operation and he didn&#39;t know that
and so what people need to understand
we have to be very careful about this
just because the Congress authorizes or
the president authorizes an
investigation
like there is now at Arrow this office
at Pentagon doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s clean
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually scientific
doesn&#39;t mean it has to be overseen and
given the corrupting influence and money
and power and threats of this criminal
organization we have to assume that they
will be compromised that&#39;s what happened
to Senator innuise and reads and
Stevens&#39;s initiative that money
the what I said to General Herbert was
visualize this you open the toilet lid
dump 22 million dollars into it and hit
the flush button that&#39;s what happened
and so if it had been 22 billion dollars
it would have been the same Dynamic so
having you know this is the sort of
information that also goes into a RICO
because this General and everyone
involved in that that&#39;s 22 million
dollars in taxpayer money exactly that
was essentially taken under false
pretense and thrown away totally thrown
away again money laundering directly one
of the enumerated crimes that we can
directly prove in a court of law now uh
through deposition testimony through uh
live testimony through in court
proceedings
um I&#39;m hopeful that the rule of law will
once again
um you know approve uh to be a force for
Change and good and and and it&#39;s going
to take civilians it&#39;s going to take yes
civil lawyers of all stripes and uh and
capacities uh so please get in touch
with our uh assembling legal team uh yes
one of our um one of our volunteers uh
pro bono attorneys paralegals law
students uh and all other individuals
with any sort of connection with the
legal uh uh profession uh should get in
touch with us at the links provided as
part of this video and one of our team
will be in touch with you and we are
very excited to work with you and to
bring your specialized areas of
expertise on board because this is
certainly a story and a legal um a legal
initiative that is going to is far
beyond the capacities of any single
attorney or any single you know group of
uh legal professionals uh Beyond
um you know just a single jurisdiction
or a single uh mindset or or a set of
expertise so I think we we we need to
um assemble everybody uh from
intellectual property law patents
related litigation civil rights law
constitutional rights we also need
criminal defense uh for uh alleged
violations or non-disclosure agreements
um you know secrecy Oaths that sort of
thing uh related clearances
um any everybody with expertise in this
area should contact us immediately
um if you have experience serving in the
House and Senate Foreign intelligence uh
foreign relations committees energy and
natural resources committees uh
oversight Committees of All Sorts please
get in touch with us and of course
anything having to do with Advanced
Energy electric gravitics and related
Technologies laws and policies again our
email address that&#39;s been established by
a team
disclosure.legal gmail.com please
include your full legal name and all
relevant contact information uh your
interest in working in the subject area
uh your States in which you&#39;re licensed
to practice law
your current resume if you can upload
that through our reform link and one of
our team members will be in touch with
you in short order uh thank you I&#39;d like
to and thing I want to thank you Derek
for hitting this up um you know I&#39;m sort
of putting a thousand directions every
day but I&#39;ve always wanted to do this
and and thank you for taking your time
uh to head this up and help organize it
and all those of you who respond I want
to thank you in advance because uh you
know if we don&#39;t have the rule of law
then we&#39;re in the jungle and so uh you
know if we want to go forward as a
civilization we&#39;d only need to have this
matter uh truthfully disclosed and the
Technologies brought forward but we also
need to live under the rule of law
otherwise whatever we we&#39;re you know
we&#39;re living under some sort of
undisclosed uh totalitarian or
authoritarian uh criminal group really I
mean that you know so this this gets
into really some basics of as a
civilization as an people in America uh
how we want to go forward and to correct
a big mistake that happened under
Eisenhower&#39;s watch uh because he took
his eye off the ball a bit uh in the
late 1950s and so we have now whatever
it is 65 years of uh this entire matter
being run very much illegally and
criminally and that needs to be
corrected do we need to correct this
problem and that is part of how we uh
the the documentary coming out is called
The Lost century and how to reclaim it
but this is part of how we reclaim it we
it&#39;s not just a technology and the
energy it&#39;s through the re-establishment
of the the trust of the people and the
rule of law and our government of and
for and by the people being properly run
I also want to emphasize that all you
military and office holders have taken
an oath to uphold and defend the
Constitution against all enemies foreign
and domestic
and so I think we have to remind
ourselves those with that who took those
those whether they&#39;re a politician or
someone who&#39;s a cabinet level person or
someone who&#39;s been in the military or
the government that is something that
everyone should begin to take very
seriously on this matter and now that we
can prove and establish that these
projects were run criminally even though
99.9 of everyone involved didn&#39;t know
that I mean I&#39;ve spoken to Navy Seals
and Delta Force people and people at
Area 51 and they were just doing their
job in a compartmented operation they
had no idea the Congress and the
president were not read in and didn&#39;t
know or that even senior flag officers
at the Pentagon were being denied access
and threatened they didn&#39;t how would
they this has been quite frankly my task
and job is to get to that level and and
the bottom of it and this is something
that I learned in December of 1993 when
I laughed out loud when the person
setting up my meeting for the CI
director for Bill Clinton said they made
inquiries and can&#39;t get any information
on this I said this cannot be true I&#39;m a
young doctor I was like you&#39;re right I
don&#39;t know how old you are now but I was
like 37 or something and I go this is
not possible
and then I found out in fact it was
possible and that&#39;s how the system had
been run for a very long time
for you know 40 some years before I I
went into that briefing and so I think
that we have to understand that this is
not just an academic exercise this has
real consequences to the future of our
planet and to the United States of
America and to humanity that this gets
resolved in a peaceful Manner and that&#39;s
why we want this to be uh very clear we
are not looking to have anything that is
some uh you know violent Uprising we&#39;re
looking to do this and unwind this
through a peaceful legal means both by
our actions as a civilian operation and
and project but also through the
Congress and the White House it can be
done but it&#39;s going to take a lot of
coordinated effort our Rico effort the
congress&#39;s effort uh and I think
ultimately uh the cooperation of the
media and so my last appeal would be
people who have contacts in the major
media
who they can send this YouTube link to
should do so because they think they&#39;re
going to find there&#39;s some very
newsworthy information here
so again thank you guys I know we got to
run but until next time and thank you
Derek and everyone you&#39;re working with
and Paige and others
thank you Dr Greer and I look forward to
seeing you June 12th at the national
Press Club
