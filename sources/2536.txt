Individual Completeness

"A sudden idea oj the relationship between
lovers. . . . We are neither male nor female.
We are a compound of both. I choose the male
who will develop and expand the male in me;
he chooses me to expand the female in him.
Being made 'whole'. Yes, and that is a process.
By love, serve ye one another.” From the diary
of Katherine Mansfield, English author.

To a Stranger . ..
An Introduction
STRANGER, whom I meet today, do you realize that tomorrow
may bring us nearer together as fellow workers or comrades?
Though we have never met before it is all possible; the poetry of
friendship, the music of love, the rich achievement of intimacy—
and it is ail possible for us.
ONE DAY sunders and another unites, and all relationships
begin in the meeting of strangers. Therefore, let us meet one
another fairly, each willing to taste the flavor of the other per­
sonality.
IF YOU HAVE HEARD aught of me from others, put their
thought of me aside when we meet, for it may be that I would
not be to you what I have been to them. It may be that your eyes
are clearer for a glimpse of my vision.
WHAT I have heard of you I shall also strive to forget and
embark upon unknown seas to discover a distant continent where
God lives.
LET us begin, when we meet, to write the story of our acquaint­
ance upon a fair white page.
IF there is aught in me that pleases you, show me, I pray you,
something of your pleasure. Let it shine as the sunlight upon a
flower hitherto hidden in darkness.
HIDE NOT THE TRUTH that dwells in the house of your soul
behind the shutter of FEAR. Be yourself bravely, and surely you
will inspire me to like heroism.
DESPISE me not if I reach out to you with both hands, for
perhaps I need help, or perhaps I bring a gift. You cannot tell.
COME TO ME, IF AT ALL, without compromise or condescen­
sion, and let us meet with the grandeur of kings and humility of
beggars, for it may be that in the future we shall serve each other
well.
Marguerite Ogden Bigelow.
PART I
We all know that there is only One Cause, God, and that there­
fore, there is no effect from any other cause. Everything we see
in manifestation is really an idea of God, but these ideas are seen
at present dimly through the mist of matter (or the mist of our
own material misconceptions). Thus it is, that we appear to see
evil in our world and to so misinterpret the good that lies round
about Fortunately the "mist of matter” is rapidly thinning and
destroying itself as all lies eventually do. There will be nothing
left, of course, but God’s perfect world. In the meanwhile, it
behooves us to understand all the truth we can about everything.
The mist thins quicker when we are thinking truly.
One of the greatest problems for human beings today is that
of tangled human relationships and all the evils which ensue,
such as: loneliness, jealousy, incompleteness, inharmony, etc.
Look at the material world; we see in the vegetable, mineral
and animal kingdoms, two elements; the masculine and the femi­
nine. Not only here, but also in music, art and literature, these
two elements persist. They are as follows:
In M usic
Major tones, masculine
Minor tones, feminine
In Art
Straight line, masculine
Curved line, feminine
In Literature
Prose, masculine
Poetry, feminine
Now, even though we are still looking at God’s perfect world
through the mist of matter, we know that the counterfeits must
be something like the original in order to be counterfeits. So
we know that these two elements appearing again and again
throughout our world, bear evidence to Cause or God. We find
these two elements in God are Father and Mother. Thus, the
metaphysician prays: "Our Father-Mother God”. Now which
[1 ]
are God’s principal qualities as Mother, and which as Father?
1 offer them to you here, as Mary Baker Eddy, Frederick L.
Rawson and other leading scientific teachers have given them:
Masculine Fem inine
Truth Love
logic intuition
strength beauty
frankness refinement
courage gentleness
vitality purity
initiative co-operation
reason revelation
Man (meaning all the spiritual beings in heaven) is God’s
total consciousness, bearing evidence to all of God’s qualities.
Man, therefore, is the perfect blending of masculinity and femi­
ninity as one complete consciousness.
Each individual individualizes the one man. Therefore, each
individual, individualizes complete consciousness. If you think
of an individual as body (which he is not) it will be difficult to
perceive this. But if you think of the individual as conscious­
ness, you will see that, in perfection, he is a blending of all God’s
qualities. Otherwise he would not be complete. You will note
that each masculine quality is complemented by a feminine
quality. Thus, Truth plus Love equals completeness.
Since the individual is both masculine and feminine, his body
is not himself, but a symbol of his present experiences. Because
a woman has a female body does not mean she lacks masculine
qualities. It means that she is functioning a predominantly femi­
nine experience. Since her body symbolizes the feminine in her
consciousness, what symbol or proof has she of the masculine ?
Naturally, she sees men in her world. These masculine symbols
can be seen by her only because she contains those elements in
herself. We can only see in our world the proof of elements
existing within our consciousness.
No one lives in a world wholly feminine or wholly masculine.
This proves that we are complete because we see both. Even the
nun in the convent sees plant life (which symbolizes both ele-
[ 2 ]
ments) and the monk in the monastery is surrounded by the
minerals of the rocky hillsides, and all hear music and read litera­
ture. In other words, do what you will in the outer world, you
cannot escape completeness. It is already established as God.
What has this to do with our present human relationships?
Just this. In the material thought, we were taught to believe that
we were incomplete as individuals and so we sought all manner
of relationships to complete that incompleteness. This resulted
in disillusion, friction, loneliness and restless seeking—but we
now know in Truth, that we are already complete and that the
individuals who appear in our lives under sequence (through
treatment) are brought there that we may have proof of our
own completeness. God’s ideas must be exchanged in order for
us to be happy.
PART II
"Henceforth . . . I . . . know no man after the flesh."
Man and woman both turn to the same God which proves
that there is no gender in Spirit. If there were, man would turn
to a masculine God and woman to a feminine God. There are
no two individuals alike in all the world. This proves that God
is infinite and never repeats Himself. Consciousness is not form.
It is awareness. You are your awareness. Consciousness has no
form, therefore may have ho sex. Consciousness is sexless. Yet
it is complete because it can think. It can be aware. Everything
to be one must be complete. If it is less than one, it is two-thirds
or one-fourth or something else. An individual is a one there­
fore he is complete. You are not one-half of an individual. You
are a complete thinking apparatus. Because we are complete as
consciousness, consciousness is aware of ideas. Because formerly
you went out to get something from an incomplete basis, you
received an incomplete experience. God is Alpha and Omega.
If you start with incompleteness you end with incompleteness.
Because I am complete in God, everything in heaven and earth
is a part of me.
Don’t think of yourself as body. Think of yourself as aware­
ness and realize that you have the capabilities of God. If you are
a woman, whether the man in your life is your father, son,
[ 3 ]
brother, husband, friend, sweetheart, or business associate, real­
ize that he is your masculine qualities personified. (Persona
means mask). We need to be impersonal. Most women say
that other women are "catty”. You are talking about yourself.
There is nothing that is not pure, gentle, loving, and kind in
God. When women begin to appreciate the God qualities that
sort of thing will die out. The eternal feminine is the higher
idea of God. The feminine part of yourself is the higher part.
(Woman means man with a womb, or the capacity to reveal
ideas).Woman symbolizes the womb of the universe from which
all ideas come. If we are complete in ourselves, we see complete­
ness in others. Man looks to woman’s intuition, if she respects
his logic. Let us impersonalize.
PART III
We seem to be living, most of the time, in the past or the
future, and from the Absolute Science analysis of the Here and
Now, both past and future are characterized as beliefs or lies.
No one can function either. "Life to the individual is just that
instant of consciousness at the instant of which his knowing
faculty is aware.” ("Condition of Being,” by Jay W. Cook.)
We can only live in the present, but, "what fools we mortals
be” when we discolor and adulterate the glories and beauties
of the Present Instant with anxiety about the future and regret
of the past.
Now, going further, we can see that we are always postulating
the past as cause. When a "patient” comes to a practitioner and
states his difficulty he can usually tell what brought the condition
on, and that cause lies in the past. He may perhaps, on the other
hand, bring you a hypothetical problem over which he is worry­
ing because of the possibility of it appearing in the future. In
both cases, he is suffering from the effect of time outside what
he calls "The present”.
If we do not understand Principle we unwittingly attempt to
sustain the very inharmonious appearances which are giving us
difficulty for we believe that there is life in the image and seeing
the image break up or change form, terrifies us. What we need to
know is that Life is not in nor of the image and that man can
{4]
merely reflect Life. Also we must see clearly that there is only
one activity, the activity of God. All things are "working to­
gether for good”. . . hut only those who "love the Lord" (see
the Truth) can know that.
The Scriptures say "Except ye be born again, ye can in nowise
enter therein”.
Each time we transcend the present sequence by acknowledg­
ing the instantly available idea "Peace” or "No-thing” or "The
Void”, the old sequence dies unto us—we transcend it—and we
are "born again”. Then a new idea of destiny is established in
consciousness.
When the student perceives that his difficulties have all been
related to past and future speculation, he is glad to renounce both
and live in the joyous abandon of the Present. He realizes that
the Present is Completeness and his every need is met at the
instant. There is no more potent treatment than to acknowledge
that "Everything is all right Here and Now”.
This acknowledgment is the great Eliminator, for note that
its very nature is a law of expulsion to everything unlike itself.
One does not need to outline just what form the demonstration
will take. He can trust Principle to eliminate all that has been
established from a divisible basis. But one should give no con­
cern to what is taking place in the realm of appearances after
he has "put the Eliminator” on it. This is his time to "wait
patiently on the Lord”.
Students often ask why certain losses and upheavals have come
into their experience. Could they but see this fact—that as soon
as they have formed inharmonious concepts about persons, places,
things or situations, the Eliminator starts to wipe out such appear­
ances! In the removal of them we may see death, separation,
divorce, lack and all manner of unpleasantness until the field is
clear. Let us illustrate this.
We all individualize the masculine and feminine qualities,
as I have pointed out. Now suppose in experience one is func­
tioning a feminine sequence; is a woman. She may have acknowl­
edged some masculine symbol as husband and then have found
certain discrepancies after marriage. Her constant and positive
acknowledgment of flaws (whether silent or audible) will set
[ 5 ]
up a sequence of elimination which will eventually separate her
from her husband by death, divorce or separation.
The masculine and feminine symbols appear there, as mar­
riage, but even if the marriage symbol has not been an unfolded
idea in the sequence of this individual, nevertheless she would
still be complete; that is to say, she would still individualize the
masculine and feminine qualities of Being. These phases are
eternal. All that we can do is to exchange one symbol for an­
other, but there must always be a symbol, in the realm of appear­
ances, to bear evidence to the presence of an eternal idea. So in
place of the symbol "man”, the symbol "absence" or "alone-
ness” would appear. Nevertheless the masculine idea is still
present in consciousness. Note that the woman in the illustra­
tion would say that she was "divorced". Divorced from what?
You see there is a reality there, or she couldn’t talk about it.
Another woman says "I am ’single’.” There must be an idea
existing from which she considers herself "singled out". In
other words, "married, divorced, single and widowed” are desig­
nations we give to self to indicate what is happening in the realm
of appearances and note that they all have as their basis, com­
pleteness, or the eternal union of the masculine and feminine
phases of Being.
We all entertain the ideal idea of each person, place, situation
and thing. We may not examine consciousness carefully enough
to be aware that these ideas do have a very definite existence,
but nevertheless they are true. Now the important point for the
student to perceive is, that the only reality of anything is the
ideal idea of it. By reality, I mean substance, continuity and per­
fection. So sooner or later, each and every one of us must (re­
cognize) recognize the ideal idea of this compound idea, Universe.
Now being true to Self really means being true to the ideal idea,
does it not? How many difficulties do you think we would have
with Individual Completeness or any other phase of existence if
we were always true to Self?
In our youth (if we are women) we discover through litera­
ture, song, drama, or mere everyday experience, that we are en­
tertaining a masculine ideal. The symbol which would win our
appreciation must have certain qualifications, we aver. These
[6 ]
qualifications are sometimes spiritual, often mental, and more
frequently physical. The younger we are, the more apt we are
to clothe the physical symbol of beauty with romance.
So we say that our heroes must be "handsome, manly, brave",
etc. After a while we add—"clean, honest, ambitious”. Ulti­
mately we demand "sympathy, spiritual discernment, apprecia­
tion of art” or higher symbols of abstract qualities.
Each individual woman has some masculine ideal. Each indi­
vidual man entertains the feminine counterpart. In the everyday
world, we classify these carelessly as "tastes”. Now ideals are
always all right, and the difficulty lies not in the fact that we
entertain high ideals, but in the fact we permit life to substitute
for us.
In other words, we weave the garment of our ideal. Then in­
stead of waiting for the Prince (or Princess) charming to make
an appearance—resting peacefully in the completeness of the
instant—we begin to let the restless, race belief of divisibility
have sway in our consciousness, and in so doing acknowledge
"incompleteness” the very opposite of the idea we would have.
Of course incompleteness has "to be completed” so we look
about us in the objective realm for the symbol which most nearly
embodies our ideal. Naturally the symbols which would be ap­
pearing at that instant would be the evidence of our condition
and our condition then would be based on an incomplete concep­
tion of self. But not satisfied to "wait patiently on the Lord”,
we attempt to cut down the garment of our weaving to fit the
symbol we have included.
Perhaps it doesn't fit very well. At first, we overlook this but
times and experiences will only magnify the discrepancy and we
will begin to see in this symbol all that is opposite to the ideal.
Criticism sets in. Blame for the symbol. Blame that is unfair for
our acknowledgment of incompleteness, our own readiness to
let life substitute, these are the real culprits! We were not "true
to self”.
Right here I want to point out the greatest truth in all these
Individual Completeness lessons. It is this: every man and every
woman embodies all that there is to completeness.
In other words, the idea 6 is a perfect idea and although we
[7 ]
may write some very poor and irregular numerals on the black­
board, nevertheless each six symbolizes all that there is to the
idea 6.
Now, to reiterate, all that we have of any individual, is our
conception of him. Therefore exchanging one personality for
another, in the realm of relationships doesn’t get us anywhere.
It is the common belief that some personalities are more suited
to us than others. Here we again accept the belief that complete­
ness can exist outside of self.
Going back to the period in sequence, where we accept an
inharmonious symbol—one which eventually manifests discrep­
ancies. Was there really anything lacking, anything wrong in
the other individual ? No, it was still simply our concept of him.
It can readily be seen, by this, that our happiness does not depend
upon the identities with whom we are associated, but rather does
it depend upon our conceptions of those identities.
So the woman, who divorces one man and marries another, to
find happiness, will not gain that happiness unless her condition
of consciousness has changed for she will only perceive in the
second the flaws she discovered in the first, since they really exist
within her cognition.
We shall never find satisfaction and happiness in the marriage
relationship until we have learned the truth that the one we
acknowledge under such conditions can and does embody all of
our ideal. This is analyzing from the basis of the One. All ex­
perience must ultimately be brought into the subjection of the
One.
The man or woman who seeks happiness, flitting from per­
sonality to personality in the vain attempt to find completeness
is like the butterfly flitting from flower to flower whose life is
precarious and short-lived. Such individuals must discover sooner
or later that completeness exists as self and this recognition must
precede any steps they may take in the realm of relationships to
find happiness.
Naturally we cannot "outline” as to what will take place in
any individual's experience. Turning to the Absolute with the
true understanding of Being, of the completeness of Self in The
Eternal Instant, permits Principle to delineate Its own orderly
[8 ]
unfoldment. How the pictures are arranged, and re-arranged
will not concern us, provided our condition is one of Peace.
As soon as a woman begins to find flaws in the man she loves,
these flaws start to magnify a thousand-fold until gradually,
there is little of her original estimate of the man left. She says
the man is changed but since all we can know of another is our
opinion of him, the change has, in reality, taken place in her. To
those who are still working from a relative basis, this would
appear to be a mystery, for the one who believes in divisibility,
thinks that there are minds many rather than Mind One. Such an
one says: "But so and so did change. He used to be a good hus­
band. Now he is doing thus and so. Is this right? Am I to blame?"
Oh, the women who have asked the writer that question—Am I to
blame? There is only one correct answer. No, you are not to
blame. It is not your fault, as F. L. Rawson says: "Rather it is
your misfortune." (Due to ignorance)
I cannot emphasize too much the importance of appreciating
in the Present the Presence of the Ideal. The ideal is always spiri­
tual, present, invisible. We cannot see ideas but we are aware of
the symbols of these ideas in manifestation, whether they be men­
tal or so-called physical manifestation. That is... the qualities of
perfection are always present in consciousness and to appreciate
or give constant recognition to these qualities is wise. Results
and the form they take are unimportant. One can be sure of this
much: satisfactory results will be in proportion to the present
appreciation of The Finished Kingdom.
Man is spiritual, perfect and divine. At this instant, the mas­
culine and feminine qualities are eternally united. (Seen phe­
nomenally as marriage.) Mr. Rawson taught us to acknowledge
Truth as it is, giving no attention to any evidence which does
not conform to the ideal.
Be true to Self! Self demands peace, completeness, joyfulness,
perfection. All things in heaven and earth. And demanding them,
it has them! "Acquaint now thyself with Him and be at peace.”
Awake!Stop complaining about the picture—man. He is "of such
stuff as dreams are made”. He is subject to appearance, disap­
pearance and reappearance. The real man, the eternal, invisible
[ 9 ]
idea of the Ideal, is changeless and everpresent. Over him, mis­
understanding, separation, divorce and death have no power.
To turn always to the appreciation of the masculine and femi­
nine qualities of Being is to be surrounded continually with "the
male and female of God’s creating” as Mrs. Eddy calls them and
to find one’s self in just the right relationships, associating always
in all paths of life with glorious men and women.
PART V
"Home should be the center though not the boundary of the
affections.”—"Science and Health With Key To The Scriptures”
by Mary Baker Eddy.
Spiritually speaking, and that means truly speaking, man’s
home is his consciousness. In that consciousness he may include
many symbols of home, but the consciousness itself, infinite in
extent, eternal in nature, is his everlasting "Father's House". Our
Master said, "In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were
not so, I would have told you.” Here Jesus is pointing out the
heart of His teaching, the soul of His ministry, the life of His
message, namely, that man can never die (never get out of con­
sciousness) and that there are many experiences, many relation­
ships for man, or many mansions in His Father’s house and he
simply includes or recognizes one after another in law and order.
If it were not so, He would have told us.
I am bringing all this out for the benefit of those students who
say "I want to demonstrate a home." They may mean different
things by that word "home”. Sometimes they merely mean a
house or dwelling place, sometimes they mean marriage, a hus­
band and children, sometimes home simply means to them a
retreat from the world, a place of peace and security. Whatever
their so-called heart’s desire is, they must all learn the primary
point in obtaining a satisfactory manifestation of the idea
"home”. This point is the one just explained that man’s home
is spiritual and is his consciousness, the pure transparency of
Being. The proper symbol of home to give him satisfaction and
joy will appear as he begins to clean out the false conceptions of
his spiritual home or consciousness. First let him ask himself
what qualities this home should symbolize. Does he want luxury,
[10]
elegance, refinement or simplicity? All of those qualities are
qualities of Mind and must be realized spiritually.
Too much outlining is done by the uninstructed student. He
thinks that home must be in a certain place, of a certain type and
that Divine Mind cannot offer him anything better than his own
imagination has. Remember that "Eye hath not seen nor ear heard
. . . the things that He hath prepared for them that love Him”.
The student should abandon himself completely in the joy of
appreciating the qualities which he would see manifested in
"home", "marriage” or any other problem and, as Mr. Rawson
used to say "Watch God work”.
I have pointed out that the animal, vegetable, mineral, artistic,
musical and literary worlds bear evidence to the presence of the
masculine and feminine phases of being. Now, I want to show
you that even in our spiritual application of the principles of life,
we use these two symbols. The masculine element is activity
(dynamic) and the feminine element is co-operative, (gentleness
and love). The time to be active, intensive and dynamic is in
your treatment work. The time to be loving, co-operative and
receptive is in dealing with other people.
Note how we have reversed this: Most people are rather timid
and colorless about their treatments as if they rather doubted
their efficacy. On the other hand nearly everyone is more or less
dominating, wilful and assertive when dealing with his fellow-
man. The two attitudes should be reversed.
PART VI
Think through a problem once in order to focus on the ele­
ments that need reversal—then treat. Be absolutely honest with
yourself.
Don’t relinquish an idea—God wants you to have what you
want! Keep on affirming it and assuming it is so, and it will be so.
Always work on the God-side; then you are working on the side
of agreement and harmony.
Pride has to be discarded if there is to be love. Pride of any
form is egotism; note the distinction between pride and self
respect. Love is always something to be proud of—it takes love
to make demonstrations. You have to love to give treatments
[ n ]
and love the people for whom you are working (you can’t be
bored and get results in Truth).
Don’t try to manipulate personalities—handle thought only!
The masculine element of God is positive and active, and the
I AM is its name because the active quality of God is the I AM.
When an individual is functioning a masculine sequence he
passes on his idea through the conscious thought; he like's to be
heard, and likes the feminine element to receive what he says
because he is the giver.
The positive thought of the masculine is positive to receptive
thought of the woman, and the receptive thought of the woman
is positive to the conscious thought of the masculine.
In all personal relationships we should rely on treatment as
our protection and guide. You haven’t much faith in God when
you worry about your loved ones. Rely on treatment and not on
personality.
Set up no moral code but turn in thought to God and trust His
guidance. Man’s progress depends upon the number of seconds
in the twenty-four hours in which his attention is turned to God
and His perfect world.
Forget yourself! Be happy, make others happy, and watch God
work. Drop all resistance.
From a metaphysical point of view the masculine principle,
being active, should be in the realm of mind; the feminine, being
love, should be manifested in our activity in the outside world.
The problem today is that this rule has been reversed. Our treat­
ments should be of the masculine nature, dynamic, active and
powerful; our external activity and attitude toward our fellow-
man should be the feminine quality of love, co-operation, toler­
ance, appreciation.
Companionship means affinity of spirit.
If you believe that men don't want intelligence in a woman
you are libeling your masculine symbols and there will be a
"kickback”. Men do want intelligence. There is no separate men­
tality. There is only one which is God, Infinite Mind. "I in you,
you in me, and all of us in the Father.”
Self-justification is the root of all personal relationship prob­
lems.
[ 1 2 ]
Everyone of us is exactly the same; we are only depicting a
different representation. Embryo life is a balance of both the
masculine and feminine.
There is only One Mind so how can women be inferior or
superior to men?
That of which you are aware is your consciousness and your
world. If you don’t like the masculine concepts in your world
get a better concept. There is only one I AM.
You will always attribute to someone else what you have not
weeded out of your inner consciousness.
Assume that an idea is true, acknowledge that it is present, act
as if it were so, and it will be so. Ask yourself the question, "How
would I act if my demonstration were made? Happy, free, joy­
ous. Then act as if it were true, and it will be true, because it is
true.
Look upon all persons as yourself—make no criticism, com­
parison, or judgment, because you are malpractising yourself
when you do these things.
Never unload your problems on someone you love! Turn to
God, and treat, and the best thing that can happen will happen.
How would I act if my demonstration were made? Be happy!
Law of Attraction: 1. Love
2. Joy
3. Sense of humor
In all situations rely on treatment for the right solution. It is
better to stay right where you are and treat than to take any
material steps (see page 85 of "The Nature of True Prayer" by
F. L. Rawson).
To return to the Law of Assumption: If a thing were not true
in its essential nature it would not come to you as desire. Strictly
speaking there are no wrong desires, only wrong interpretations.
Desire is the prophecy of fulfillment. There are only four de­
sires: Health, Wealth, Love and Expression. When you desire
something it is a sign that the desire is fulfilled. Acknowledge
the presence of the good you want, act as if it were so, and it
will be so.
Don’t switch your attention from one problem to another until
[ B ]
the appearance of a problem has been erased completely from
your consciousness. Stay with your treatment long enough—
don’t give up and say "Truth doesn’t work” because Truth does
work, and it will work if you get yourself out of the way and
not doubt.
There is no memory. "And the former things shall be brought
to mind no more.” It never happened. The real maft never did
it, never said it. It never happened; therefore it cannot repeat.
Beware of putting people on the defensive. Every time you do
it they are much more likely to repeat what they have done. This
applies particularly to children and husbands.
Every individual is complete—there is no such thing as an in­
complete "one”. That complete one is comprised of the unity of
Truth and Love. Wherever you find divisibility or any separative
force it isn’t Truth. God is Truth and Love. Anything that isn’t
Truth isn’t Love, and if it isn’t Love it isn’t Truth.
Love is understanding appreciation, agreement. If you love
any person, place or thing they are drawn into your world. (To
quote Dr. James E. Dodds: "If you love any person, place or
thing you must attract them right into your world inescapably.
They must be marshalled into your world by that power of
Love.")
When a man comes in contact with his fellowman an exchange
of ideas results and at that instant the relationship is spontaneous
and perfect.
In any personal relationship problem ask yourself "How is it
in Heaven?” Then dwell in the consciousness that all men are
perfect spiritual beings, absolutely loving, in perfect concord,
agreement and harmony.
There is no monotony in heaven. God’s world is a world of
infinite variety. Because God is infinite he could never make two
things infinitely alike. Whenever you get into a rut you are not
experiencing Truth. For Truth is Life and Life is activity, the
continuous unfoldment of perfect ideas.
Universal love is the ideal of every Truth student. Eventually
we will have to have a feeling of kindness to every person in the
picture which is just as complete as your love for your best
friends. Every human being who comes into your world is a
[ 14 ]
bringer of good, God’s means of revealing Himself. God gave us
human relationships in order that we might know Him. How
can you love God whom you have not seen if you do not love
your brother whom you have seen?
God doesn't intend man to go into isolation to understand
Truth. Jesus lived the Truth in an everyday world and that is
what we must do. We must not withdraw from Life which is
God, but live it more abundantly. Consider your fellowman first
or you are not putting God first. Remember that a message of
Truth has to be taken home if it is to be a Truth message.
When explaining a point of Truth to another think only of the
Truth but not of the other and his problem.
The person who is more spiritually minded in a partnership
should give more and be more tolerant. "To him that has been
revealed much, much is expected." But he should use his knowl­
edge wisely and never aggressively.
Good manners will do more to preserve marriage, friendship
and business relationships than anything else. Good manners are
courtesy and courtesy is an off-shoot of Love. Don’t criticize your
partner’s family.
One of the chief mistakes a woman can make is making her
husband think she is a martyr, has made a sacrifice, and given up
something. Beware of such an attitude.
Our circle of consciousness is first our Self and our home, then
the city, state, nation, and world. Solve all relationships at home
in Truth first. There is no wisdom in cleaning up your world by
beginning far afield. Consider the thing closest at hand which is
yourself and your home.
Restriction reacts on the person who does the restricting."What
is bound is loosed, and what is loosed is bound.” Free all those
whom you love and be happy in their good fortune. Drop all
resistance, be happy and make others happy, and watch God
work.
Comparisons and contrasts do not belong to Truth. Do not
malign yourself and God by having a low estimate of yourself
as compared to another person. There are no competitors, no
rivals, no enemies.
We know that we really love someone when we want their
happiness more than our own.
Don’t be afraid to admit being jealous—but face it and then
overcome it. Be absolutely honest. You can’t overcome a problem
with will power or reason, but only by treatment. Jealousy will
leave you if you Jet the one you love follow his own bent. Don’t
deal with the "other person”. Deal only with your own thought
and the whole picture will be cleared up.
Law of attraction: Freedom, no condemnation; rejoice in your
fellowman’s good fortune.
Never concern yourself with other people. The particular niche
that you have to fill is a God-born niche and no one else could
fill it but you!
We don't live in four walls; we live in the presence of Love.
Acknowledge the positive presence of Infinite Love.
PART VII
The wisest mothers have taught their children by prayer and
example.
Our Father-Mother-God is the complete Principle of Being,
both masculine and feminine. The masculine principle is called
the active principle; the feminine principle is called the perma­
nent (stabilizing) principle.
There is no such thing as birth for there is no material creation.
A child is a new idea unfolding. The child-parent relationship
symbolizes to us the meeting of three spiritual beings in heaven.
Wipe out belief in birth and belief of death will vanish.
In closing, I want to present to you a very important idea which
has been misunderstood by many Truth students and much ma­
ligned throughout the ages. It is the maternal quality in love; the
finest quality that we have. Maternal love has two elements—
purity and constancy. Note that, no matter what the child may do,
the real mother remains loyal; that is because in spite of the
appearance, she has a pure idea of the real individual. Constancy
is, of course, the other quality of maternal love, for a mother
never ceases to love her child.
Now this should reveal to us something that is far beyond
biology.
[ 1 6 ]
The Mother element of God is the higher. The feminine Prin­
ciple produces all, and out of the Motherhood of God or the
womb of the universe come forth all things. This feminine, spiri­
tual principle in man—the image and likeness of the Mother-
God—is the highest quality we know.
The maternal has been scoffed at in women when applied to
their relationship with men. This is a bad mistake psychologically.
True, we can get a false concept of the maternal and find a
woman who is bossy, possessive and jealous. That is probably
what the writers were talking about when they described a
woman’s love toward the man in her life, but ask yourself, is
that your idea of an ideal mother—bossy, possessive and jealous?
I think of my mother, or the one who represented the Mother­
hood of God to me, as being just, allowing me freedom and
giving up everything for me. That, I believe, is the ideal mother
to all of us. The one to whom we turn for comfort, sustenance
and advice. That love which shines through the sins of the world,
and has a divine compassion, forgiving in the higher sense, and
offering wisdom, and guidance. That greatest of mothers—Mary
—most typifies our ideal of true motherhood.
It will be seen in our spiritual advancement these days that
there will be a greater happiness in the relationship between men
and women when women remember that their first function is to
be the inspirational element in a man’s life. There has been a lot
written about the temptress—having glamour—allure—and all
that sort of thing, as a means toward happiness, but in the final
analysis all living things return home, and home is presided over
by mother. Many an attractive woman who thought she had cap­
tured a married man has wondered why he returned to his wife,
who was perhaps outwardly plain and simple. The answer lies
right at that point and wise women will heed it.
In our relationship to all people we should exercise the moth­
erhood qualities of
1. Complete tolerance and understanding, which will
offer help but will not demand.
2. That deep comfort of love, given warmly and joyfully.
3- The unpossessive attitude which allows the other in­
dividual his freedom and rejoices in his happiness first.
[1 7 ]
If half the time spent in beauty salons and dress shops were
given to a little spiritual study, manyheartaches could be averted;
not that we are condemning any modern or normal way of im­
proving the appearance, but to believe that that is enough is
stupid. The great fact remains that women are the mothers of
the race whether they have children of their own or not, and
Love is the great motherhood quality which lasts when every­
thing else fails.
CONCLUSION
Summing up, in practical statements, our knowledge of Indi­
vidual Completeness:
1. If you want to demonstrate companionship, first real­
ize that you are complete in consciousness. Then affirm, as
your own, all the qualities that you want to find in another.
2. If you want to eliminate an obnoxious personality
(which is only your concept) go back to Mind and think
actively of the spiritual qualities of the real man.
3. Whom God hath joined together, no man can put
asunder. If a third person seemed to step in between you and
someone else, it is because there was no real spiritual unity
between you and that person.
4. All happiness in marriage depends upon, spiritual
unity. There must be an affinity of qualities.
5. Never outline as to what will follow your treatment.
The best thing that can happen, will.
6. You don’t really love any one until you want their hap­
piness more than you want your own. This analysis will elim­
inate jealousy.
7. There is no use to condemn material expression. It is
only the present symbol of our interpretation of unity. In
other words, intercourse merely symbolizes two individuals
exchanging ideas in heaven. It is no more important than
eating a meal or going to sleep. The evil is, in believing that
the counterfeit is reality. Reality is always in the realm of
spiritual idea.
8. It is best, at present, to fulfil the laws of "this world.”
Thus marriage is still the safest harbor for those wanting
[ 1 8 ]
spiritual advancement. Flying in the face of material con­
vention requires too much treatment for protection from
the race thought, to be worth while.
9. There is really no material conception or birth, and all
problems of this kind can be handled by realizing the vir­
ginity of Spirit which cannot be violated. All God’s children
are mature individuals, spiritual beings, which have always
lived, do live, and always will live, one with God.
