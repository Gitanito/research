I&#39;m just trying to give you sort of a
sense of what happened before May of
2001 with the what&#39;s now very famous
National Press Club event so this was
all going on with the idea that if we
were to provide the correct information
to the president in to his advisors and
to members of Congress to key people in
Congress they would do the right thing
and would disclose this information
because the Cold War had ended and we
thought here&#39;s a fig leaf to put on the
secrecy even though it&#39;s a bit of a
misdirect but politicians always need to
have a cover cya
Washington&#39;s all about cover your ass so
to explain 40 years of secrecy they
could have said well during the Cold War
tensions we didn&#39;t want to throw into
that mix the fact that we&#39;re being
visited by interstellar civilizations
and with also a program to study what
their technologies are and now that the
Cold War is over we can come clean so I
was recommending that they use that as
an excuse for the shekinah II that had
gone on between 1956 and 1990s 40 years
well it was an interesting thing that
happened in the fall of 1993 I was given
a lecture at the Colorado State
University hosted by astronaut Brian
O&#39;Leary and Morrie Albertson who was one
of the cofounders of the Peace Corps and
they became very very close friends and
supporters of what we were doing and in
that presentation I laid out the entire
sort of manifesto of justifying
disclosure ending secrecy and what we
should do and at the end of that talk
and I don&#39;t know there were maybe 800
people there thousand something like
that there was a man a little bald man
standing at the back of the room
and he wouldn&#39;t leave and he waited -
almost everyone was gone he came up to
me and here the dr. Greer I think I can
help you with this I know some folks in
Washington who want to know about this
but they&#39;re not getting any good answers
I said well like who and I thought he
was gonna say you know staffers for
congressman blah blah from nowhere bill
Montana and he said well I&#39;m very good
friends with the Director of Central
Intelligence the CIA director and he
would like to be briefed on this and of
course I said well that&#39;s a good start
so yeah initially that meeting was set
up for November of 1993 and it got
pushed back host of scheduling conflicts
that he had and I had to December 13th
1993 my wife Emily was there with me and
the cover story was a dinner party just
here in Arlington at this man&#39;s home and
with the CI Director and with his the CI
directors wife dr. sue Woolsey who was
the chief operating officer of the
National Academy of Sciences so which is
very good because I feel we can get two
birds with one stone here because she&#39;s
a very senior scientist in a very
prestigious institution so again we got
a nanny for the kids flew up to
Washington had this meeting now I know
normally when you meet with someone at
cabinet level it&#39;s a you know very tight
maybe twenty minutes fifteen thirty this
went on for about three hours and the
initial part of it I had this whole
briefcase and portfolio full of all
these images of photographs and
documents and cases and all this stuff
and after about 10 minutes the CIA
director said okay I&#39;ve know this we
know that they exist and it turns out he
and his wife that had a sighting in New
Hampshire when they were younger
I want to know and this is the key
question to answer why won&#39;t they tell
me in the president about
I&#39;m the CIA director I said ah well
that&#39;s another discussion and at first
you know I got some hint of this when I
got the letter which I have in my arc
high school subsequently Woolsey tried
to backpedal and say this briefing never
happened he publicly said so and I can
prove it to be a lie always say in
Washington how do you know they&#39;re lying
their lips are moving lips are moving
too means their line so ouch did I just
say that I did it&#39;s on the record there
you go so but the letter I got
describing the briefing from our host
said that you&#39;re going to free the first
person to brief the president&#39;s people
and his CIA director on this issue
because they&#39;ve asked questions and they
can&#39;t get anything through channels now
at that point I have to say I thought I
was being zoomed I really thought this
was a prevarication and that they that
this spy master the CIA director just
wanted to pick my brain find out what we
were doing with folks like the
Rockefellers and dah dah dah and it
turned out he a hundred percent was out
of the loop he knew nothing about these
projects and he was being completely
deceived by those who had compartmented
intelligence within the agency the CIA
and he literally was he was the Emperor
they had no clothes and so was the
president so it was at that point on
December 13th 1993 that I realized that
we were living in a country that had
undergone a quiet coup d&#39;etat decades
earlier that isn&#39;t talked about in the
New York Times in Washington Post
because it would be the biggest story
ever and the biggest scandal ever they&#39;d
rather talk about the blue stain on a
dress and other trivialities or the
stain on a blue dress and rather than
talking about the truth and we at that
point had put together a white paper
which is in my first book
about extraterrestrial intelligence
which you can get on a website at
serious disclosure comm and it describes
basically the plan of what needed to be
done by the chief executive the
president and his people to end the
secrecy so I had that in my hands and I
was giving it to to the CI director as
he was leaving and he looked at me and
he said how can we disclose that which
we have no access to very chilling
question so in other words if we were to
push on this then it would unveil the
biggest constitutional crisis in the
United States history and no president
wants to admit that they&#39;re out of the
loop on important things no one wants to
admit that therefore he said we will do
what we can do I will continue to look
into this please continue to send any
information you have to me through this
contact but we&#39;ll have to see what the
president can do that meeting as I said
was about three hours most of it was
talking about contact the technologies
why secrecy would be as extreme as it is
and this is the why of secrecy is much
more difficult for people to get their
minds around than the how so let me
first do the hell everyone thinks
there&#39;s something called above top
secret well in the United States
government most governments there&#39;s
there&#39;s no such thing there&#39;s actually
confidential secret and top secret but
then within these classifications there
are compartments so you have TS s CI s--
top secrets but the special
compartmented intelligence so TS s CI
it&#39;s the compartment you&#39;re in that
matters some compartments like what
Edward Snowden exposed about prism was a
compartment that the president
and the oversight committees of the
Congress knew about however misguided
they may have been they were legally
overseeing compartments which is why
he&#39;s in trouble there are other
compartments that are unacknowledged
special access projects special access
projects require these clearances and
the unacknowledged ones mean exactly
that they are acknowledged to no one
outside the compartment and that
includes the President of the United
States or the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff or whoever so one of the
big mistakes that people make is
conflating people&#39;s position in the
military of the CIA Congress the
presidency the White House the National
Security Council the whole alphabet soup
of government agencies with access all
access just because they have a top
secret clearance to every compartment
and I know men who are in one
compartment and earn one section and
they have a friend that&#39;s in another
compartment and they both have
top-secret clearances very high
compartments and they do not know what
each other&#39;s working on they may be best
friends and they won&#39;t know and that is
how it works but the unacknowledged
special access projects mean that
they&#39;re not acknowledged and this is
what rumsfeld meant the day before 9/11
if you look at the film serious when he
said there&#39;s 2.3 trillion dollars
unaccounted for in the Department of
Defense budget over the last few years
not billion trillion now it&#39;s at least
five trillion and now this is no flaming
liberal this is Donald Rumsfeld okay who
dragged us into this misadventure called
the Iraq war along with Dick Cheney and
some other neo cons who didn&#39;t
understand the Middle East obviously or
anything else for that matter dealing
with world politics and so but he
literally said that I don&#39;t know if he
knew it was being filmed but it was and
we got it and it&#39;s in the film serious
so what does that mean two point three
trillion dollars on account
for it means that there is no accounting
I know an auditor who audits my uncle&#39;s
old company was Northrop Grumman which
has a lot of top-secret work on certain
kinds of aircraft just like Lockheed
Martin has certain contracts dealing
with anti-gravity propulsion craft and
if it&#39;s a an unacknowledged compartment
and it has some billions of dollars in
it the auditor will be told you don&#39;t
have a need to know what&#39;s going on with
this and it is just rubber stamped as an
audit they have no idea where that
money&#39;s going it goes in the front door
where it&#39;s going through the back door
god only knows all right
we estimate between a hundred and two
hundred billion dollars every year is
going into the unacknowledged government
and this is a conservative estimate
unacknowledged Congress doesn&#39;t know
where it&#39;s going the president doesn&#39;t
know where it&#39;s going seeing a lot of
senior military people don&#39;t know how
it&#39;s being used and where it&#39;s going my
military adviser for 20 years was in one
project that was a three billion dollar
unacknowledged special access project
the Admiral that he was working under
where they basically went in to ask if a
secure communication intelligence
facility underground everyone&#39;s weapons
were taken everyone&#39;s cell phones
watches anything electronic taken one
man went down there with them with a gun
and the gun with it was the security
enforcement officer for that you SAP
unacknowledged special access project
you SAP and they were all told the guy
took a bullet out of the chamber and
they said if you tell anything anyone
about anything going on in this
unacknowledged project there is a bullet
with your name on it and it will find
you somewhere somehow now this is not a
movie this is actually how that world
works that&#39;s the world I&#39;ve lived in
since 1993 and or been exposed to and so
that is serious stuff and they mean it
and so
and so my military advisor said oh
absolutely this is no john lecarre novel
or john grisham story this is really how
the unacknowledged super black world
operates now of all the projects that
are unacknowledged black-bag operations
of all kinds special operations of all
kinds the blackest and the most
unacknowledged or ones dealing with UFOs
and extraterrestrial intelligence by far
and so that&#39;s why when you read the
document from 1919 50s from Canada the
Wilbur Smith document where he says
after talking to someone in the United
States government this is a Canadian
top-secret document that got
Declassified accidentally it&#39;s on our
website and he says this subject is the
most secret subject in the United States
and exceeds the secrecy surrounding the
development of the hydrogen bomb at that
point we hadn&#39;t detonated a hydrogen
bomb imagine something more secret than
the ultimate doomsday weapon not an
atomic bomb a thermonuclear hydrogen
bomb which is what we were working on in
51 so the thing I point out to folks is
that these sort of operations have
gotten so out of control that that&#39;s why
Eisenhower said beware the
military-industrial complex when he left
office in 1961 just before Jack Kennedy
took office and Eisenhower on his watch
and he was bitter about this to the very
end Jackie Gleason a famous comedian his
wife told our team that Jackie Gleason
and Eisenhower were good friends that
Gleason was bitter about this and
heartbroken about this to the day he
died that he had lost control over these
UFO projects and that happened between
1956 and 1961 now why did this extreme
so so this gives you an idea of how
unacknowledged special access projects
work they&#39;re hermetically sealed silos
and no one outside that compartment that
matter your position in government
doesn&#39;t matter your clearance will know
what you&#39;re doing in it so wrap your
mind around that that is how these
projects are managed
and we&#39;re talking an almost limited
amount of money they can use in access
to enforce this and run those projects
is it legal
no is it dangerous yes because it is a
by definition completely without
oversight of the people the people&#39;s
representatives or the President or for
that matter the senior folks at the
Pentagon I&#39;ll get to this in a moment so
at this point I&#39;m reeling I&#39;m just sort
of like I&#39;m absorbing all this look I&#39;m
a country doctor in North Carolina
rambling around in the ER taking care of
shootings and stabbings and car wrecks
and burns and what-have-you and this bag
of crap gets handed off to me and I
think well you know this is way past my
pay grade I&#39;m just
and in January or early February 1994 a
friend of the presidents comes to our
home a man that I had met some time
earlier and name is Kevin Foley this
year&#39;s enough gone above a share his
name and his brother would stay
overnight at the White House a lot and
had breakfast with the president he was
a big fundraiser for President Clinton
from Minnesota Foley family very
well-known political family and I&#39;d gone
up there and met with his family and
what have you and he came back to my
home and he said well we were having
dinner around the table and we in this
house and we had in North Carolina and
he turns to me and he says well the
president and his folks really are very
supportive of what you&#39;re recommending
in this white paper this set of it
recommendations I&#39;d given the CIA
director but they&#39;re concerned that if
he does this he&#39;ll end up like Jack
Kennedy and I start laughing I think
well I think he&#39;s joking I mean this is
ridiculous
and he stops me and cuz he was sort of a
big kind of heavyset jolly
sort of
gregarious political operative you know
and I just thought he was making a joke
like about happy if I tell you I have to
kill you sort of cliche and he stopped
me and he says no they&#39;re not kidding
I said well Kevin oh don&#39;t talk about
this in front of the children or the
children were small then and I said we
need to you know talk in the library
after dinner about this so we went to
the library after dinner to talk about
this issue and I was very very concerned
that this could even be on the radar of
anyone at the White House and he says
yes absolutely the president is
convinced and his people are convinced
that if he were to push on this issue
that he would be subject to tweet a
termination with extreme prejudice
t to BP tweet and I said well then what
do you want me to do I mean look I mean
it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve got a Secret Service
detail and he said well no they think
you can do this you should go ahead and
try to bring this stuff together and
bring it I said oh yes I said I&#39;m
expendable he says yes as it doesn&#39;t
matter if I get killed you can&#39;t risk
the president he said that&#39;s right you
are expendable so from then I always
call myself their throwaway guy doesn&#39;t
matter if I get killed you know because
I&#39;m nobody and I remain nobody so and I
want to be a nobody in terms of politics
and conventional power so I&#39;m very happy
to be a nobody so what I use that term
in the sense of how Washington thinks
the currency of power and I said well
I&#39;ll do what I can but you know this is
a very steep climb
you
