OBJECTS OF THE SOCIETY.
It has been widely felt that the present is an opportune time for
making an organised and systematic attempt to investigate that large
.group of debatable phenomena designated by such terms as mesmeric,
psychical, and Spiritualistic.
From the recorded testimony of many competent witnesses, past
and present, including observations recently made by scientific men of
-eminence in various countries, there appears to be, amidst much illusion
and deception, an important body of remarkable phenomena, which are
prima facie inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis, and
which, if incontestably established, would be of the highest possible
value.
The task of examining such residual phenomena has often been
undertaken by individual effort, but never hitherto by a scientifio
~ociety organised on a sufficiently broad basis. As a preliminary st.ep
towards this end, a Conference, convened by Professor Barrett, was
held in London, on January 6th, 1882, and a Society for Psychical
Research was projected. The Society was definitely constituted on
.February 20th, 1882, and its Council, then appointed, have sketched
o()ut a programme of future work. The following subjects have beii1
-entrusted to special Committees :-
1. An examination. of the nature and extent of any influence
which may be exerted by one mind upon another, aparl>
from any generally recognised mode of perception.
2. The study of hypnotism, and the forms of so-called mesmeric
trance, with its alleged insensibility to pain; clairvoyance
and other allied phenomena.
S. A critical revision of Reichenbach's researches with certain
organi~tions called "sensitive," and an inquiry whether
such organisations possess any power of perception beyond
a highly exalted sensibility of the ,recognised BCnsory organa.
igitized byGoogl
4 ObJect8 oj tile Society.
4. A careful investigation of any reports, resting on strong
testimony, regarding apparitions at the moment of death.
or otherwise, or regarding disturbances in houses reputed
to be haunted..
5. An inquiry into the various physical phenomena commonly
called Spiritualistic; with an attempt ~ discover their,
causes and general laws.
6. The collection and collation of existing materials bearing
on.the history of these subjects.
,The aim of the Society will be to approach these various problems
without prejudice or prepossession of any kind, and in the same
spirit of exact and uninipassioned inquiry which has enabled Science
to solve so many problems, once not less obscure nor less hotly
.debated. The founders of this Society fully recognise the
exceptional difficulties which surround this branch of research;
but they nevertheless hope that by patient and systematic effort
- some results of permanent value may be attained.
The Council desire to conduct their investigations 8.s far as possible
through private channels; and they invite communications from any
person, whether intending to join the Society or not, who may be dis-
posed to favour them with a record of experiences, or with suggestions
for inquiry or experiment. Such communications will be treated, if
desired, as private and confidential. .
Letters relating to particular classes of phenomena should be
addressed to the Hon. Secs. of the ~spective Committees, as

The Society for Psychical Research is now in a position to invite
the adhesion of Members. It is desirable to quote here a preliminary
Note, which appears on the first pagEl of the Society's ~onstitution.
" NOTE.-To prevent misconception, it is here expresslystated that
Membership of this Society does not imply the acceptance of
any particular explanation of the phenomena investigated, nor
any belief as to the operation, in the physical world, of forces
other than those recognised by Physical Science."
The privileges and conditions of Membership are defined by Rule.
IV. and V. as follows :-
Rule IY.-The Society shall consist of:
(a) Members, who shall contribute not less than two
guineas annually, and who shall be entitled to hold any of the
offices of the Society ; to vote in the election of the Governing
Council, and at all meetings of the Society; to use its Reading
Rooms and Libraries; to borrow books from its Libraries; and
to the free receipt of any journal, -transactions, or periodical
publication which may be issued by the Council.
(b) .A88ociates,who shall contribute not less than one guinea
annually, and who shall be entitled to attend all meetings of
the Society, except such as are convened for business purposes,

by his authority, shall assent to the Constitution and Rules of
the Society, and consent to abide and be governed by
them, one of whom shall have certified in writing, from
persona! knowledge of him, that he is a. fit person for admis-
sion. Every such certificate having been read and approved at a
