For this I was given total anesthesia, and did not wake up normally from the anesthesia after an operation. I recovered consciousness at 06:00 hours, when my husband started to shake me so I could wake up, because he wasn't getting any reaction from me.

During those moments, while I was unconscious I began to see a very intense tunnel full of a light too bright and my body went towards this tunnel. I felt an intense incomparable happiness. I arrived at the end of the tunnel and, surprised, I saw a beautiful garden full of flowers. Then I saw a prince or very bright angel dressed in bright white clothes who was indicating that I should be back to the tunnel, to which I no longer wanted to return. He, upset, pointed to me that I should go back. I went back to the tunnel of bright light reluctantly - because I wanted to stay. And this is when I woke up and saw my husband sitting by my side shaking me.
