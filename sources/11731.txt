  		              		Experience Description   

  I was struggling to breath during the night time while I was in the intensive care unit (ICU); 48 hours after anesthesia and aspiration from  aspiration pneumonia.   I was coughing and totally exhausted.  I started to panic because I was disoriented and couldn't call the nurse for help. 

  Suddenly, I was drifting.  I was lying peacefully on my back surrounded in a pale blue glow while moving into a calm blue void. I was not alone, despite not being able to see anyone.  We were all connected. I felt so much peace and belonging.  I was home and safe.  I also felt joy, acceptance, and that I was loved and that others cared about me just because I am me. Here, I didn't need to be, do, or say anything to be accepted or prove myself. 
  
  Then, I woke up, in my body while receiving a sternal rub.  There was a flashlight being shown in my eyes as a dozen of the ICU staff moved around in a chaotic way.  Apparently, there was a low SPO2 alarm that went off. 

  I remember the shame, guilt, and disappointment that I felt upon returning.
