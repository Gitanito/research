 This was the organ of Koreshan Unity in San Francisco, and when that community merged into the Chicago group in 1892  the journal was continued from Chicago.  Its purpose was exalted: "With the plowshare of love we will turn up in humanity's field the soil so long hidden from, the warmth of God's wisdom and with the pruning hook of truth we will trim the Tree of Life of its hell poisoned branches until â€˜the wilderness and solitary places shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.'"  On a more practical level the journal criticized "the merciless foe of every form of Governmental usurpation and thievery and of corporate monopoly" in favor of "a masterful system of commercial equation, whereby the producer and consumer are brought face to face."  On Cyrus R. Teed's Koreshan Unity, see the note under The Flaming Sword.  S.C. Gould in Notes and Queries, 8/7 (July 1891): 322, describes the journal as "Truth on all live questions fearlessly, plainly, and pungently expressed.  A live journal on live subjects, religious, commercial, financial, social, and moral."  Koreshan State Historical Site.
