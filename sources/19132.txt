my name is Ted Lauder and I got the I&#39;m
a professor of Earth Sciences and the
Institute for the Study of Earth oceans
in space at the University of New
Hampshire I&#39;ve been there since 1972
I&#39;m professionally an oceanographer and
mostly dealing with the chemical aspects
of the oceans and the coastal zone
so it wasn&#39;t until about almost four
years ago that I was talking to my
cousin a a Steve Lavigne who is now a I
can&#39;t think of a brigadier general in
the Army Reserves he&#39;s a lawyer in North
Carolina and I was talking to my first
cousin
you know I very close as children but we
got away from each other for many many
years he was in North Carolina I was in
various parts of New England what have
you and we got away from each other but
about four years ago he and I have been
talking and he told me that he had been
in some meeting on the west coast with
some astronauts and Russian astronauts
and what-have-you and I said Steve
what&#39;s this about astronauts you were
talking to and he flips out this card on
the table that was the card of a Russian
astronaut English on one side Russian on
the other and he looked at me and said
Ted did you ever hear area 51 the
Roswell no he said they&#39;d ever hear of
the Roswell just Roswell and said of
course everybody&#39;s heard of Roswell at
that time probably everybody hadn&#39;t but
I certainly had and he said well it was
real and I said oh really
tell me more and so we spent the next
three days in intense conversations I
could barely sleep at night when my
cousin sat there and told me the things
that he had known the people he&#39;d talked
to and everything else and he was in the
White House during the Eisenhower&#39;s
administration he had top-secret
clearance and he was in cryptography he
worked on Project Blue Book for a period
of time he saw material from the Roswell
crash and he had no reason to lie to me
at all he&#39;s my cousin I mean we&#39;re best
friends for you know all of our
childhood and it&#39;s just that no reason
at all and you know all this he told me
all this and so I didn&#39;t have to go
through the the long doubting period
that most people do here was somebody
who was an inside person telling me this
stuff is real so within a matter of
probably hours or something
I was I was absolutely convinced that
what he was telling me was real and now
I had to sort of sort it out and I spent
during those first few nights when I was
there I must admit I spent a lot of
at night lying in bed saying oh my god
it&#39;s real what are the implications in
other words I didn&#39;t get hung up on the
real stuff I said what are the
implication if this is real then
therefore that then therefore that etc
and it so I realized even at that time
that if this is real this is probably
the single most important thing in this
planet today and the depressing thing is
that they&#39;re already available there is
already knowledge of how these things
function and it&#39;s not available to our
society and that that has me extremely
annoyed not so much for a personal point
of view but from a societal point of
view and I I was flying down on the
airplane just today and in sitting there
in this airplane thinking about here we
are flying on this fossil fuel driven
device using technology that&#39;s just an
extension of the Wright brothers almost
a hundred years ago within just a couple
of years it&#39;s going to be a hundred
years since we&#39;ve been driving fossil
fuel driven airplanes and yet the
technology I now know has existed for
almost 50 years or about 50 years and
has probably be usable in terms of a
craft for maybe 40 45 years or maybe 50
years I don&#39;t know exactly when and Here
I am still flying in this thing I&#39;m an
oceanographer
and I work with the environment
extensively I teach classes about the
environment at different aspects of the
environment and I realize and I see how
much is going on in there right that
doesn&#39;t have to go on so and I realize
that these that some of the technologies
that the ETS if you will or the craft
represent or technologies that could
help us they can also be used for
defense purposes or military purposes as
well but like the old saying goes a
knife can cut or it can spread butter
the same holes with technology and
there&#39;s no it&#39;s ridiculous to hold back
the technology and that the depressing
thing is that this the knowledge of this
which is kind of the single biggest
piece of knowledge there is that we are
not alone in the universe that we are
actually a member
a family of if you will nations or
people&#39;s throughout the universe and
that we&#39;re not alone is is amazing it&#39;s
going to it&#39;s going to alter the way we
view ourselves on earth forever more and
that&#39;s and so that&#39;s why I realize this
is so incredibly important and the
argument that people can&#39;t handle it and
all this turns but I don&#39;t think it
flies at all I&#39;ve talked a lot of people
about this and I have never seen anybody
go off the deep end when I told them
what I know the meeting my cousin was
that was as I understand it because this
is a few years ago we talked about it
but as I understand it this the group
the see SETI group the Center for the
Study of extraterrestrial intelligence
group that dr. Greer heads had put
together a group of scientists former
astronauts both cotton cosmonauts so
they&#39;re both American and Russian and a
number of military people and some
civilian people who knew that the
subject was real and as I understood it
they were they had gotten together held
a meeting to discuss the implications of
the disclosure of this information and
how to get this information out to the
world public and so my cousin was there
as one of the witnesses one of the
people who knew the subject was real
knew that Eisenhower knew it was real
because as I understood it his direct
boss at the White House was the one who
briefed Eisenhower on what was happening
in the UFO field and my cousin was aware
of what was going on and my cousin had
met Eisenhower a number of times what
have you but I decided that I wouldn&#39;t
go public if you will about this until I
saw something that was absolutely in my
face seen by multiple witnesses and
there can be no argument and it was that
happened for me and everybody kind of
remembers their first time if you fell
it happened for me when I was in Desert
Hot Springs in the fall of 97 and there
was a group of us twenty-something was
sitting around in Joshua Tree National
Monument this is AC SETI training a
group led by dr. Greer and we were out
in the field
observing and trying to observe see
craft of some sort and it happened to be
a rather full moon or pretty much of a
full moon evening and I was facing the
moon is off to my right shoulder and
just below the moon there appeared an
object like a globe like a ball maybe a
third to half the diameter of the moon
it just appeared to the left side
underneath the moon and it just traveled
from this side of the moon about like
that over to the other side of the moon
and then just what it just disappeared
it just it just turned off it&#39;s as
though somebody had turned a light bulb
on one side of the moon and then carried
across below the moon so it wasn&#39;t from
the moon but below the moon and then
turn it off and I said and I saw I said
I was so excited I said Wow did anybody
else see that I&#39;m sort of almost jumping
up and down because it was so clear and
so obvious to me and dr. Greer luckily
he was facing that direction so he had
seen it and I said did anybody else see
this then dr. Greer said yes he said I
saw it did anybody else see it and about
I don&#39;t know five or six people in the
group said yes I saw it yes I saw
so all sitting on that side where he was
and the the implications are are
many-fold I think one thing it will do
it was it will this is maybe hopeful but
it will bring the peoples of the earth
closer together it will give them a
different sense of themselves as a race
will realize we&#39;re not alone on in the
universe that we&#39;re part of a multi
larger family of intelligent races
conscious people&#39;s if you will and I
think also there&#39;s going to be some
there&#39;s some major technological
implications as well because as I mean
the first question and this is probably
one of the major reasons why this topic
is kept been kept quiet so long the
first question that one might ask even
the man or woman on the street is going
to ask
well if there are these peoples from
other planets and they&#39;re here visiting
us how did they get here
did they have to come at the speed of
light and take four to hundreds of years
to get here even at the speed of light
or did they come with using some other
technology well they&#39;re going to find
out of course that they&#39;re using some
other technology and they don&#39;t have to
travel the speed of light they Strava
lit superluminal speeds
semi instantaneously if you want to put
it in those sort of terms and so that at
that point you can say holy mackerel
these technologies could you&#39;ve used in
a piece away benefit our earth
civilization in a major way and so then
where do they get the energy to travel
these great speeds and then we start to
look into the inner they aren&#39;t using
jet fuel they aren&#39;t using coal to get
here they&#39;re using technologies that the
average guy in the street the average
physicist in a university doesn&#39;t have
any clue about and yet it&#39;s very real so
the implications are for hopefully a
Planetary Society that does not that can
go beyond the coal coal and oil and
those aspects in fact one of the major
problems I&#39;ve seen and talked about for
years on our planet is that this planet
is basically offering its people a
several hundred maybe about a hundred
year 150 year window to develop new
technologies it&#39;s about a hundred and
fifty years
you can argue the numbers of coal and
fossil fuels in this planet that have
been laid down over hundreds of millions
of years we have a very short time to go
from burning wood to oil and coal and
nuclear to a sustainable energy and if
we blow it because we haven&#39;t got
interact together we&#39;re toast and I said
I was appointed by the governor of the
state to attend a congressional briefing
a close congressional briefing on this
topic with people like Edgar Mitchell
speaking about the reality of this and
what have you and they say Oh
really tell me more so that&#39;s one that&#39;s
one reaction of my scientific colleagues
on a one-to-one basis part of this
gentleman&#39;s problems was he was a
civilian but had done a lot of work with
NASA a lot of committees and
what-have-you and I think his problem
was the fact that he hadn&#39;t heard about
this as being a real subject and he knew
that he was very important because he
was on a lot of committees in NASA and
since he was very important but hadn&#39;t
heard about this thing this couldn&#39;t be
true because since he was important he
would have heard about it you see the
logic there and in he sort of said oh
okay and so he went on and on and on but
as the conversation went on and I told
him more about what I knew and the
reality of these things he got colder
and colder toward our discussion and it
started off very warm because we both
know a lot of mutual people and so there
was sort of a coming together in that
sense and I realized afterwards that he
was very threatened by this knowledge
because what the particular job that he
was doing in NASA would be majorly
impacted by the knowledge that their
extraterrestrials already here on this
planet visiting our planet and that they
have the ability to travel through space
and what-have-you and so I might my
sense was that his raison d&#39;être the
reason hit he works at NASA and his eco
is sort of wrapped up in this would no
longer be as a valid a reason if what I
was saying was true and so he pulled
back from me and then he said a very
curious thing I wouldn&#39;t believe it even
if it was real this is direct quote from
his email to me I would not believe this
even if it was real and then he went on
but if you learn anything more about
this let me know so and it&#39;s so you can
say so I was left with us forget it I&#39;m
not going to if your mind is so closed
that you make a statement I wouldn&#39;t
believe it even if it was real it tells
me we have a major problem
with scientists and our universities in
getting them to accept
something different than their paradigms
that they&#39;re so used to or been grown up
with that&#39;s a major problem within our
whole universities interestingly enough
the students that I&#39;ve lectured to are
far more open-minded than the
professor&#39;s and I&#39;m a professor and I
deal with these people all the time
a couple other points to keep in mind is
that the Roswell and similar events in
New Mexico in the late 40s allowed
certain parts of the US government to
obtain downed craft extraterrestrial
craft since that time that was late 40s
it&#39;s now 50 some years later since then
the black projects have pumped hundreds
of billions that&#39;s hundreds of billions
of dollars maybe approaching a trillion
I don&#39;t know the number it&#39;s big it&#39;s
bigger than Bill Gates had pumped these
ountry untold billions of dollars into
researching the technologies reverse
engineering these technologies such as
anti-gravity and space travel in a whole
bunch of technologies that are
associated with extraterrestrial
technologies allowing these these a
space travel to occur and other other
aspects of that now if you&#39;ve just put
in several hundred billions of dollars
into something you can be doggone sure
that something&#39;s come out of that and
and people have told me that they that
we were had spent a tremendous amount of
money by the mid-50s on antigravity
there&#39;s anti-gravity literature in the
public domain and there&#39;s a tremendous
amount going on there
so I and I&#39;ve heard from a number of
different quarters that we have
anti-gravity techniques actually in
craft that can fly as discs in fact it
is my sense of things from a number of
different sources
the vast majority of extraterrestrial
quote extraterrestrial crafts that
people observe in the United States in
other parts of the world are not
extraterrestrial they&#39;re actually our
military or our covert black ops people
that these are fully reverse engineered
seen what are sometimes known as alien
reproduction vehicles ARVs
these are craft that have been a reverse
engineered and I&#39;ve seen some I saw a
craft a few years ago which I thought at
the time was extraterrestrial at this
point I mean you can&#39;t tell when they&#39;re
in the distance but at this point I
think probably it was a v-shaped craft
heading down a Santa Barbara Channel
witnessed by somebody else both of us
night-vision $1,500 night-vision scope
and this craft was traveling between
four and eight thousand miles an hour
down the Santa Barbara Channel and Tony
Craddock and I witnessed this with the
night vision both of us had night vision
we both saw at the same time and it was
it was hauling and I thought it was
actually the disc escorted by jet in
Sedona two years ago that&#39;s and I was
thinking exactly exactly the one I was
thinking of in Sedona two years ago when
I was there with a whole group of see
SETI people again we saw an alien
reproduction vehicle or XCore escorted
by jets u.s. jets flying with this
object that was acting totally different
than the Jets it was silent it was
moving differently than the Jets I knows
he said he is to try to get the federal
government ier both legislative and
executive branches to come to grips with
this in a public manner to get the
Senate or the House Congressional
branches to hold hearings on the subject
to get it out that doesn&#39;t seem to be
happening they seem to be scared to
death of it and for all kinds of reasons
that politicians are scared of anything
dangerous they seem to be scared to
death of it
I sincerely rias hopes of the executive
branch might be willing to come out with
this but I&#39;ve actually
ask questions of al gore and the public
forum about this I know that the
President Clinton has received briefings
on this information he knows it&#39;s real
but he hasn&#39;t been willing to come forth
as well so as a scientist in one in
those that subject is real I&#39;ve talked
to my legislators I&#39;ve talked to my
classes I&#39;ve talked to my students and I
think very personally that people who
know this subject is real oh it to our
society in to our planet to come forth
and speak out about this I&#39;ve got two
sons in their early 30s and I want to
see this planet and it sounds maybe
corny in some quarters but anybody who
has children wants to see them have a
future on this planet that is good as I
had it or better and I see that unless
the subject comes out this planet will
not be as good as I had it or better
it&#39;s going to be worse from a pollution
point of view and from a breaking down
of our society in our democratic society
I&#39;ve talked to a number of people who&#39;ve
studied this issue and feel that the
quote cover-up of this issue that has
been going on for the last 50 years is
probably the biggest single threat to
our democratic society it has ever faced
since the Constitution was founded in
this country was founded in 1776 we are
at a major crossroads in how our society
and our democratic society and
government function because this topic
is not under control of our elected
government is not under control of our
judicious judicial government it is
under control of others some of who are
members of our government some of who
are members of the industrial complex
and they are in control of this issue
the single most important issue on this
planet today and that is not healthy in
the long run for
or our people for a long time we had the
threats of Russia and the cold war and
there was a reason perhaps misguided but
there was a reasonably good reason and
I&#39;ll give him that for keeping this
quiet because we didn&#39;t want the
Russians to find out about this
technology we didn&#39;t want the Russians
to find out about the existence of
extraterrestrials in a center which of
course they knew all along as we now
know and we probably knew it then but
for whatever demented reasons it was
kept away from the public so it wouldn&#39;t
quote get to the Russians course they
knew what was going on because they were
spying and so it was really it was being
kept from the public not from the
Russians but so but that time has passed
the Cold War has ended in its own way
and we no longer have that threat and so
the time the the arguments for keeping
the secret have gone on by the trouble
is now we&#39;re finding that people who
know it&#39;s real are afraid to speak out
there very few people there are some and
we&#39;re seeing more and more but there
very few people relative to the numbers
in Austria who have the courage of
conviction to say this secret has gone
on too long it is time for this
information to become known worldwide
for all the reasons that we it should
happen relative to humans as a
intelligent race among many it&#39;s time
for this information that come out for
them in terms of the technology for the
benefit of our society in this planet
and for the benefit of our ecosystems on
this planet very few people are willing
to stand up and be counted on this issue
and the excuses go on and on and on and
we talked to our senators our
representatives and they&#39;ll come up with
any excuse in the book to face this
fairly in front of them and say I&#39;m
going to do something about it and
that&#39;s why there are
only a few of us I count myself as one
of them who are willing to stand up and
say this topic is real we need to talk
about it openly and we need to move on
into that because this is keeping us as
a world society and Planetary Society
it&#39;s keeping us down it&#39;s preventing us
from moving on as a Planetary Society
and furthermore something I haven&#39;t
mentioned that is absolutely critical is
the following that the covert groups who
presently are in control of this subject
are using a very advanced technology
some of which has been
reverse-engineered from the
extraterrestrials and developed some of
which is part of the Star Wars box of
tricks etc they&#39;re using these
technologies to acquire a shoot down and
shoot down extraterrestrial craft we
have numerous witnesses who have seen
this or and know of its existence this
means that there&#39;s a small group of
people in this planet who are literally
declaring interplanetary war with
extraterrestrials who&#39;ve literally come
to this planet to observe and ultimately
to help mankind this is an untenable
situation for the peoples of this planet
to be in and extremely disturbing to me
and all of us and all of the us who are
aware of this fact that alone is enough
reason to make this public and to try to
get people to be concerned about it
I&#39;ve seen it on many films different
shapes different positions and this
piqued my curiosity with regards to UFOs
I had heard of the crash down in mixed
in New Mexico I have seen the maneuvers
