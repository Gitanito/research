I was in a car repair workshop helping a friend by holding a 40w lamp up for him in one hand and the cable to it in the other. The workshop floor was wet. Without thinking, I took hold of the neck of the light bulb, which gave me a powerful electric shock and threw me against a wall 16 feet away. 

In the moments after the shock, I felt that I was walking through a dark tunnel. Suddenly I found myself walking through a very beautiful park where there were lovely flowers, some shrubs and trees of a gorgeous green color, and the sky was a glorious blue. At the far end of the path I was following, there was a brilliant light. Everything was exceptionally beautiful.

Suddenly, I came back to life and my friends told me I was angry with them because they had woken me up. I had been unconscious for more than 8 minutes. Some relatives of mine, who lived a great distance away, said they heard me walking and breathing in their houses at the time of the event.

I have lived in Norway for 35 years and often dream about similar situations. In this country, I find I see similar scenery around me to that which I saw in this experience.
