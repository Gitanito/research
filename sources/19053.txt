Oh
so I want to thank all of you for coming
some of you who come from very far
Washington State and New Jersey in
Michigan and all over and I want to
thank all of you for coming the purpose
of this meeting is to provide an update
but also a really big overview of the
projects we&#39;re involved with
particularly dealing with the technology
in a free energy sector because there&#39;s
a lot of misunderstandings in the public
on that and that has been something that
we&#39;ve worked on now for intensely for 15
years this will be shared with the
public via YouTube and the Internet and
the reason for it is that there&#39;s a big
learning curve to understanding the
technology but more importantly to
understanding the policy issues the
national security issues the details of
how you evaluate these technologies and
moving through the minefield of claims
that are out there on the Internet in
particular which has become a huge
problem in the last year for us so I
want to first give you sort of the big
picture and the big picture is that we
haven&#39;t needed fossil fuels since about
a hundred years ago this building was
built in 1913 certainly by then
Tesla Faraday Maxwell particularly the
Maxwell for Tinian equations that were
chopped off and changed as you may well
know some of you who are engineers has
resulted in us having a energy sector
that requires us to burn something or
heat something up to create steam to get
us electricity or to run our cars
however a hundred years of really
advanced physics which weren&#39;t that well
understood 100 years ago in terms of
very high voltage systems at certain
resonant high Hertz they call it cycles
per second
we&#39;ll get into this later would result
in this excess power man it was observed
by faraday and it was observed by tesla
nose or by many others and said where is
this coming from a professor died
wracked the IRAC so well he called it
the die rack see and of course Tesla
called it the Fiat the sea of the ocean
of infinite energy and it&#39;s been called
various things the modern term is the
zero-point energy field and as many of
you may know one of the writers for
Jane&#39;s Defence weekly mr. Cooke wrote an
article about this Jane&#39;s Defence weekly
being a very big defense Journal out of
Great Britain very prestigious journal
and then wrote a book called the hunt
for zero-point which I recommend based
on a lot of information that we had
begun to put out and particularly as it
applies to propulsion alright so if you
create this kind of vector into the zero
point energy field and you create a
certain counter rotating vortex let&#39;s
call it which is almost a Suzy like
phenomenon you get what&#39;s called lift
and you get a phenomenon that&#39;s known as
a electromag no derivatives now the pop
culture we call anti-gravity just really
not correct what you&#39;re really doing
when you see a UFO moving and it&#39;s going
straight up ten thousand miles per hour
against gravity is that it&#39;s actually in
a spacetime bubble it&#39;s creating its own
environment shall we say so there&#39;s no
restrictions to normal aerodynamic
formula and so the thing can lift and go
straight up at those velocities and if
it goes through a certain another level
that the entire object the mass of the
entire object can become massless and
this has to do with things that are very
technical that we&#39;ll get into a little
bit later if you&#39;re interested in
technical part of this which i think is
fascinating and that&#39;s when you enter
into what&#39;s called the transdimensional
physics when something moves from one
dimension to another or transverses one
dimension to another by definition all
interstellar vehicles or
transdimensional
let me repeat that if it&#39;s interstellar
it is transdimensional it is not getting
here at a subluminal or below the speed
of light velocity this is a key
understanding because most people will
say well maybe they&#39;re interdimensional
or maybe they&#39;re interstellar I&#39;m going
you don&#39;t understand the physics of this
if it&#39;s interstellar and it&#39;s here
meaning somehow went from another star
system to here and someone&#39;s lifespan a
creatures lifespan even if you live to
be 800 years old it got to be faster
than the speed of light but it&#39;s but the
term fashion the speed of light is a
misnomer because you&#39;re no longer bound
by the physics of the speed of light or
the even the normal vacuum of space that
we think of because you&#39;ve resonantly
shifted into these if you will parallel
universes or in folded universes
transdimensional II and you step back
down into this one too much information
all right so this is this is the key
thing that people have to understand and
began to be studied now in the early
days let&#39;s go back to the time of you
know Tesla they were observing with
usually DC power systems direct current
as opposed to alternating current which
we use in our homes which Nikola Tesla
invented or came up with that that would
have this effect where a certain amount
of energy would go into a system more
would come out it wasn&#39;t it really
accepted until dr. Casimir our physicist
named Casimir and the Casimir effect
where this is published in mainstream
physics journals by the way prove that
there was this zero-point energy field
that there was his energy that was left
even after you cooled down all the atoms
and all the activity in the universe
down the absolute zero which is a
specific temperature
and there are still this energy there
and that zero-point energy field as it
turns out is embedded everywhere in
space not outer space here in this room
so that every cubic centimeter of space
in this room for example has enough
power to run at least the United States
for a day a cubic centimeter so it&#39;s an
enormous field of energy so running our
planet on this energy field would be
like taking a thimble out of the Great
Lakes or something of water
it&#39;s a trivia it&#39;s a rounding error
however as JP Morgan famously was
reported to have said to Nikola Tesla
when he had a car that had a little
antenna on it that was running around
where the batteries were charging its
themselves JP Morgan said if we can&#39;t
put a meter on it we will want it big
bankers now 100 years ago or nine years
ago today
nothing&#39;s really changed in terms of the
geopolitical financial macroeconomic
exigencies and that&#39;s the huge problem
is there a technical challenge yes and
we&#39;ll get into how we can we can mount a
effort together to come up with a
modern-day version of what Tesla had but
the geopolitical macroeconomic policy
issue is the big problem and it isn&#39;t
just because there are a few bankers and
kleptocrats that are misanthropic
sociopaths although some of them are
it&#39;s because there are a lot of
stakeholders who don&#39;t want to have to
deal with the change I remember my
military advisor once meeting with an
admiral who was in charge of CONUS
continental United States security
saying well this is all wonderful and I
know that those technologies do exist in
classified programs it&#39;s too big of a
change for me to have to deal with I
just want to see that everything is
stays in sort of a homeostasis we don&#39;t
rock the boat too much and I retire from
this command and get to go fishing at my
place in Montana
no really all right so having had dozens
and dozens of meetings personally with
people like that in the national
security structure in Washington in the
United Kingdom from France and elsewhere
there is this consistent refrain of this
is a great thing but it&#39;s too big of a
change it&#39;s too big of a challenge and
therefore therefore if it&#39;s that big of
a challenge it&#39;s better just to kick the
can down the road and let someone else
deal with it later
so there&#39;s been a hundred years of
kicking the can down the road meanwhile
to give you a very big picture of how
much trouble we have at this point we
have a geopolitical order where our
national vital national security
interests which is a mantra here in
Washington is a actual phrase for oil
protecting the oil interest the madness
going on into you Kane Ukraine and
Crimea right now it&#39;s a hundred percent
or largely influenced by natural gas and
world politics certainly the Middle East
anyone knows that that is people say
well there&#39;s Israel there I say yes but
they have a couple hundred thermonuclear
weapons and can take care of that I know
for a fact they do so the big problem
becomes if you have let&#39;s say in 1927 or
so 1927 there were two billion people in
the world now they&#39;re seven so of those
two billion people there are very few
people living with cars and electricity
in their homes and etc and so on now you
have seven billion people and billions
more people living on that system which
has become entrenched bureaucratically
built into our funding mechanisms from
the state local federal level of support
and also where there are a lot of very
powerful stakeholders and so from a
rational point of view you&#39;d say well
these technologies would get us off of
oil gas nuclear power no more
Fukushima&#39;s but from the point of view
of people who are looking at the
National Security equation from a Mac
economic stability point of view this is
their worst nightmare up the road here
between here in the White House if you
walk straight up the road here you&#39;ll
end up at the White House is at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue and we&#39;re on 16th
Street I was at the University Club with
a man who was sort of the consigliere
for President Bush jr. w a few years ago
and we were having dinner and this is a
place you know you&#39;d have Rumsfeld there
and other people there you know in this
place I&#39;ve been having dinner or lunch
it&#39;s a private club I don&#39;t belong to if
I was invited X had to put on a jacket
and I was shocked and appalled anyway so
I did and you know he said look you have
to understand that everyone who gets
into that house pointing to the White
House becomes governs as a conservative
from the point of view of the classic
definition don&#39;t change anything
conserve don&#39;t change state keep things
as they are tradition because when
you&#39;re dealing with the change this
large this is what the people call a
disruptive technology but writ large and
disruptive technology writ large in this
how I&#39;m speaking of it it&#39;s something
that would have a multi hundred trillion
dollar impact not billion trillion so
let me repeat that multi hundred
trillion dollar impact because once this
is disclosed and this backs into why
quote UFOs or secret and forbidden to
talk about in polite circles is that a
UFO is really just an amiss no more for
an alternative energy and propulsion
device all right they are not moving
using Exxon jet a fuel alright they&#39;re
not using a nuclear reactor on those
little things they&#39;re using this whole
new area of physics which is elegant
beautiful life-sustaining for the planet
but if you said those were real people
say oh how are they moving like that any
physicist at MIT would ask this question
if they thought it was real and had been
brainwashed by the psychological warfare
disinformation campaign launched by the
CIA in 1953 so that&#39;s the problem is
that if you begin to talk about the
phenomena of new energy free energy
anti-gravity UFOs you&#39;re stepping into
an area that is the most sensitive
compartmented intelligence in the
history of the United States
