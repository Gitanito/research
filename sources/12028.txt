  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in the ambulance en route to the hospital.  I knew I was having a heart attack but I felt no pain.  I remember thinking how calm and at peace I felt.  Suddenly, I heard my mother, who had been dead for three months.  As children we  had always joked that prayers went from Esther's mouth to God's ears.  As clearly as if she had been standing next to me, I heard her say 'You put her back!' in her no-nonsense mom's voice.  
  
  The next thing I remember is the emergency medical technician saying, 'Stay with me' and the driver flipping the siren on.  After that, I have no memory until I woke up the next morning with a new stent.

  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     I've always believed that those who went before us visit us in the present, although I always associated those visits with dreams.

Prior to her death I had spent the night at her bedside; when morning came and my sister arrived, I went home to take a quick shower before returning to her.  She died right after I left and I always felt that I had let her down by leaving.  Her coming to me when I had the heart attack gave me more comfort than I'll ever be able to explain.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Within days; most actually believed me and agreed that she was there.  I don't know if they were influenced or not.
