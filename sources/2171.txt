OUTLINES.
Phrenolog'y is the science of mind, founded upon a
knowledge of the structure and functions of the human con
stitution in general, and the brain in particular.
The human constitution is composed of six systems of
organs, upon the relative development and perfection of which
the character and talents are dependant. I
Size is a measure of power, all else equal. In order,
therefore, to know the power of organs, we must ﬁrst know
their size.
A professional examination should commence with an
estimation of
The Size of the Whole Constitution, com~
pared with the constitutions of other persons of the same
age-and sex and race.
The next consideration is, the relatch size and con
dition of
THE SIX BODILY SYSTEMS.
The OSSQOIIS System, or system of bones, con
stitutes the frame, to which all the other organs are at
tached, and combined with
The Muscular System, tends to produce
_ strength of body.
The Nervous System, (including the brain) tends
to produce activity and sensitiveness, without reference to
strength.
The three following systems are important only as
they tend to modify the operations of the three preceding.

The Digestive System, tends to produce modes
ration, indolence and sedentary habits.
The Arterial System, tends to produce vigor,
industry, and a love of varied exercise of mind and body.
The Venous System, being the magazine of sur
plus blood, tends to produce long continued action of mind
and body, without reference to energy or vigor.
PHRENOLOGICAL ORGANS.
Having ascertained the size of the whole constitution,
and the relative proportion of the systems, we should next
examine the phrenological organs in particular. They are
divided into PROPENSITIES, that originate actions; and
INTELLEC'ruALs, that direct actions.
Each propenéz'ly, when excited, produces feelings pe
culiar to itself, and thus gives notice to the other mental pow
ers of its activity and tendency.
Each intellectual, when excited, produces ideas pecu~
liar to itself.
The Propensities are divided into IPSEALS, or those
related to self, and Socm Ls, or those related to society.
The Ipseals occupy the side of the head, the Socials
occupy the back and top of the head, and the Intellectuals
are situated in the front. Each class commences at the base
oi the brain, with powers which are possessed by the lowest
animals, and receives superadditions as animals rise in the
scale, the highest organs of each class being possessed only
by man.
The Ipseals are subdivided into ﬁve ranges, corres
ponding, as nearly as practicable, to the mental gradation of
animals.
The socials are subdivided into three groups, corres- ‘
pending to the establishment, government and perfection of
society.
The Intellectuals, into perceptive and reﬂective.

NUMBERS.
Most phrenologians use numerical ﬁgures to express the
/size of the organs, and, if correctly done, it is undoubtedly
the best way. Some adopt 9% as a medium number, and,
then, of course, 20 stands for the highest, and 1 for the lowest
degree ofdevelopment. I prefer to adopt 5 as a medium num
ber, and, therefore, 9 stands for the highest, and 1 for the low
est degree of development. If a head were perfectly formed,
and all the organs equally developed, every organ should be
numbered 5; and, as there are 39 organs, the sum of all their
numbers would be 5 times 39, or 195. We cannot number
any more above medium than, we do below, for no organ can
be large without being so at the expense of others. If an or—
gan is marked 6, some other must be marked 4; and what
ever be the form or size of the head, the sum of all the num
bers must be 195, or the examination is incorrect. it is like
dividing $195 among 39 men; it would be $5 each; and it
we give more than $5 to one man, some one or more of the
others must receive less.
Simple and undeniable as this rule is, it has hitherto been
either unknown or totally disregarded by all practical phre
nologians. It is common to see a chart in which nearly all
the organs are marked higher than the medium‘ number; a
practice which, however complimentary it may seem to the
subject, is perfectly absurd, and renders the chart worse than
useless. '
In Capen’s life of Spurzheim, we are presented with a chart
of his head, taken by Mr. George Combe and Mr. Walter
Todd, in which 20 was adopted as amaximum, and the num
berof organs examined was 35. The sum of all the numbers,
therefore, could have been only 3325, if they had proceeded
correctly; but they have made it amount to 581. All Ame~
"~—32*"-

12
rican practitioners, following the example of Mr. Combe,
have been led into the same error in which he has fallen.
It should be remembered that the numbers express only the
relative size of the organs in the same individual, without re
ference to other persons. Two men' may have their organs
numbered precisely alike, and yet one head may be a. third
larger than the other; one may be a man of extraordinary ta
lent and energy, while the other is far below mediocrity, on
account of the small size of his head.
In order to make a just comparison of one individual with
others, we must ascertain the size of the whole constitution,
compared with others of the same age, sex, and race. dll
else equal, the largest constitution will manifest the most
force, both of body and mind. -
The brain is the organ of the mind, and, all else equal, the
largest brain will manifest the most power. ‘We, therefore,
ascertain the siza of the brain, compared with the rest of the
body, for if the whole constitution is above the medium size,
and then the head is disproportionately large, nothing more
is wanting to constitute true natural greatness but a favorable
proportion of the parts.
For a more particular account of my views, I refer to my larger work, with
plates, &c., which may he obtained at W. C. Little’s book store, Albany. See
also Prof. Horst'ord's Report to the Albany Phrenological Society, in favor of
Grimes’s new arrangement, &c. I
Phrenological Busts to correspond with my system, made by Bracket, the dis
tinguished sculptor, may also be obtained at Little’s, price 81.50.
Phrenologieal Charts, like this, may be purchased by the wholesale of (110
printer, in Albany, at a small advance upon cost.
