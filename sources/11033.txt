Background Information:

Gender:	 Female

Date NDE Occurred:	  August 1996

  NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?       Yes         During the procedure, some of the dye got into the heart muscles causing the heart to stop beating.

Did you feel separated from your body?    Uncertain

At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?       Drowsy

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?       No

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?       No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?       No

Did you see an unearthly light?       No

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?       A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     I was surrounded by an extremely soft, wonderful grayness, accompanied with a wonderful sense of absolute peace and happiness.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?       absolute peace and happiness.

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       No

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control

Did scenes from the future come to you?       No

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   I was surrendering myself to the wonderful peace I was feeling, listening to the doctor and nurses, when they started calling 'Lydia, come back" repeatedly.  Then I heard the nurse say "I don't think that's her name'.  When the doctor asked what my name was, I became very angry because he was treating me and didn't even know my name.  So I ripped myself out of that loveliness and peace to tell him that my name was Marge.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       No       

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Experiencing the wonderful peace and happiness was the best.  The three months following were the worst.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    They were all very interested.  If they were influenced, I do not know.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       No

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       None
