  This was a journal of thoughtful ruminations on spiritualism and "psychology"--which included both the nature of man and the soul, and psychical research--tinctured with New Church (White was a biographer of Swedenborg) and Christian ideas.  Contributions by Thomas Shorter (see the note under The Spiritual Magazine), Peter Davidson (later a founder of the H.B. of L.), Frank Podmore, "M.A. (Oxon)." (Stainton Moses), C.C. Massey, Alexander Wilder, Giles B. Stebbins, Epes Sargent, et al.  It was begun to fill the void left by the cessation of the Spiritual Magazine and Human Nature.  Although aware of the fact that its offerings would never be "popular," the journal in its last year sought to increase its circulation by promising more contributions on spiritualism proper and began to carry serialized novels of a vaguely spiritual nature.  The most notable of these was Dr. George Wyld's novelette "Dr. Macgregor Roy and the Man from the East" (July 1882)--Wyld's unkind comparison of the Theosophical Mahatmas with true Christian sages. The journal gave regular and detailed reviews of the content of contemporary spiritualist journals.  There are references indicating that Col. John C. Bundy, editor of the Religio-Philosophical Journal, had a hand in the journal's inception and was to publish it simultaneously in America, but none of these American issues survives.  Crabtree 1010.
