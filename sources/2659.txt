FOREWORD
"The wise in all ages have always said
the same things ; and the fools, who at
all times form the immense majority,
have continued to do the opposite."
—Schopenhauer, Aphorismen iur
Lebensweisheit, Einleitung.
The prerogative of the present generation to talk and
write freely and frankly about sex has been applied to an
almost unlimited extent — and as good as exclusively — to
the dissemination of unsound theories which pander to the
passions of the human animal by sanctioning, encouraging
and glorifying sexual expression for its own sake.
In order to offset those fallacies it will be necessary to
take advantage of the same prerogative to use plain,
straight-forward language in emphasizing the enormous
value of conservation of the generative force — a conserva
tion which is practically synonymous with, yet more positive
than what is commonly understood by chastity.
Unfortunately, many attempts to prove that value have
been so sketchy and clumsy, so little logical, or so biased
and bigoted, that the whole idea of conservation has nearly
lost all power of appeal.
Yet many sound and profound reasons can be put for
ward in support of a philosophy in which the central theme
is an ideal of drastic purification — a philosophy which
propounds that a permanently effective solution of the al
most inextricably entangled problem of sex can be found
only in the limitation of the sex life to reproductive activity.
And although this ideal may seem extreme, and not be im
mediately applicable to general practice, it is of most vital
importance that its fundamental principles be widely
known. For a recognition of its inherent value, and a turn
ing of face into its direction, may change the current of
human evolution, if at first only in individual cases.
Personally, the urge to formulate such an idealistic phi
losophy of humanity's most momentous and mystifying

viii The Coiled Serpent
problem became irresistible when the conviction grew that
a lack of chastity in act and thought constitutes the under
lying cause of nearly all misery, of discontent with life, of
marital disharmony, of congenital low vitality, of sluggish
intellects, of many avoidable ailments, of human wrecks in
body and in mind, and of countless untimely deaths. In
final synthesis the general misusage of the generative force
revealed itself as the basic cause not only of humanity's
woes, but also of its failure to advance in evolution.
If the ideas formulated in this book represented merely
the writer's opinion, they could carry but little persuasive
power. But it is a verifiable fact that through the centuries
the sages have almost unanimously proclaimed the signal
value of sexual restraint as an includable requirement for
the attainment of real human progres. They who possessed
superior wisdom apparently always knew that higher evolu
tion is impossible without conservation of the sex force. And
researches of modern scientists, as well as equitable obser
vations by outstanding writers, lend support to the pro
nouncements of the wise.
However, most of the relevant statements by thinkers of
the past are hidden in abstruse volumes that are hardly
ever accessible to the average person. And reports of mod
ern findings are usually diluted and discolored before they
come, in quasi popularized form, under the eyes of the lay
reader.
It has therefore seemed worth while to gather brief
quotations from a great variety of sources, and to incor
porate these into the text. Wherever they could be either
directly corroborative, or indirectly helpful in leading up to
the main issue, the words of others have been introduced.
Their profusion may serve to demonstrate the extent of
preparatory research, as well as the impersonal and eclectic
nature of the work.
In order to avoid the cumbersome effect which the
introduction of numerous quotations often produces, a
special effort has been made to blend them with the text in

such a way that the continuity of the composition is not
broken.
The reader's forbearance may have to be asked for the
large number of reference notes. They are necessary in
order to give due acknowledgment to the source of each
quoted phrase. They will be useful to the student who
wants to verify them. But reference to the notes is in no
way essential to the comprehensibility of the text.
The present volume is intended mainly to inculcate a
clear mental appreciation of the ideal.
Another manuscript is in preparation, under the title:
The Conquest of the Serpent, and will deal with practical
methods by which the ideal can be approached and realized.
Eventually a still later volume will present some deeper
metaphysical considerations in support of the claim that
THE RACE'S ONE CHANCE FOR HIGHER EVOLUTIONARY PRO
GRESS DEPENDS ON ITS MASTERY AND TRANSMUTATION OF
THE SEX FORCE.

THE SERPENT
"A serpent twisted in spiral volumes
is the hieroglyphic of evil."
— Faber, Origin of Pagan Idolatry,
1,441.
Caught in the mighty coils of the giant-serpent Sex,
"
humanity is on the point of being crushed and strangled. "
That serpent, which in the beginning was intended to serve
human evolution, was foolishly adopted as a pet and unduly
coaxed and fondled. Being overfed and pampered and
having its slightest whims complied with, the pet has grown
into a monster that has overpowered its master, and now
threatens to destroy him.
Out of the choking throat of imperiled humanity the
inner ear can hear a cry for help ascending: a fearful cry
that swells and falls and again rises, pleading for liberation
from the malignant creature's rigid hold.
But there is no response, no outside help forthcoming.
Man's precarious position is entirely self-produced. He him
self it was who gave the creature all the power it now has
by his habitual yielding to its growing demands; and he
himself must remedy this self-created woe by unrelenting
self-exertion.
"The serpent ... is the monster to be overcome."1 If
man but wills he can reduce its power. He can brace him
self against the pressure of the uncanny coils. He can in
fact subdue the unwieldy and unruly reptile even yet by
opposing its depraved desires.
By will he can reduce it to servility again. And then
its valuable hidden power will aid him in his ascent of
evolution's path. Indeed, "when conquered the serpent
becomes a means of life."1 Instead of appropriating the
life force of man, it will then supply him with the greatest
factor that can lead to a higher human existence. The
turbulent serpent of Sex will then be transformed into the

2 The Coiled Serpent
docile serpent of Wisdom, which will show the way out of
•:the;human toward the superhuman state.
"•■
But- -man- must not delay. He must unloose the coils
before the monster crushes him.
The symbol of a snake encoiling the body of humanity
occurs in the mythology of various peoples.' And Oriental
literature mentions a serpent coiled up in a mysterious
center of force inside the human body. While the two are
not entirely equivalent, the uncoiling of this serpent within
the body, as of the entwining monster, is held to be man's
evolutionary task.4
Records of a serpent symbolism in some form or another
have been found in all parts of the world. Especially of
universal occurrence are the legends about heroes who
conquer an evil serpent.5 And there can be no doubt that
these legends symbolize the necessity of man's victory over
the domineering influence of sex, for from the earliest times
folk-lore seems to have connected the serpent with the sexual
function.
Erudite investigators have come to the conclusion that
"the serpent always has a phallic signification.'" But what
usually mystifies the student of symbolism is that "though
the serpent is exhibited as the representative of the evil
principle ... it is considered also in the opposite light.'"
However, where the symbolism has not suffered in transition
there is a notable difference between the two portrayals.
While the evil serpent is coiled, "the serpent of good is
always represented ... as upright.'" This is the trans
formed serpent, not any more coiled but standing on its
tail, its body slightly curved, reminiscent of the human spine
which plays such an important part in the actual uncoiling
of the serpent.9 It is still the phallic serpent, but conquered,
tamed, and thereby changed into the most valuable adjunct
of man.
Reflective inquiry into various forms of serpent sym
bolism shows that they contain a principle of supreme im
portance — namely : that every effort to resist the demands
of the sexual urge will gradually lead to an uncoiling of
the serpent, and therewith to spiritual freedom" and un

II
IGNORANCE
"The serpent . . . ever in congress
with its infernal counterpart of ig
norance."
— Mead, Chaldean Oracles, ii,37-
Humanity is like a child that is hiding away from its
elders, who call to it because they know that it should make
an effort to develop its abeyant faculties. It is like a child
that wishes to continue to play with distorted images of
real things instead of becoming acquainted with everlasting
realities. It is like a child that persists in remaining igno
rant of the deeper verities of the science of life.
Humanity plays with life. It plays with sex. It wants
to perpetuate that playing rather than understand nature's
eternal laws, rather than unfold its latent spiritual powers.
It would play on until these very powers became stunted for
ever — until, otherwise matured, it would become an
imbecile in regard to spirit.
If the clinging to toys persists, and if ignorance is
claimed as an excuse where there is only flagrant and
purposeful ignoring, there is imminent danger of incurable
idiocy on the spiritual level. Already mankind is subnormal
for its age because it engrosses itself in precarious material
diversions; because it is absorbed in frivolous emotional
games; because it does far too little real thinking, and
remains obstinately ignorant of facts and laws concerning
its own true nature.
"Men err in their choice of pleasures . . . from defect
of knowledge"1 ; they "are content with the little goods they
have and adhere desperately to these in ignorance of the
greater blessings to which they could attain did they but
open their spiritual eyes."1
Mental development makes a child gradually set aside its
infantile toys. After a while it does not want them again,

and would not at any price wish to exchange its arduously
acquired mental enjoyments for a return to the foolish
playthings which amused it when it was ignorant.
So will spiritual unfoldment make man gradually leave
his playing, particularly with such things as were never
meant for play. It will make him rise above the customary
sexual games. After a little while he will not want these
again, will not want to forsake the far greater glorious
joys gained in his spiritual growth for a return to the
unwisely chosen playthings of his period of sensuous
amusements.
But through sheer wilfulness and cherished ignorance
humanity seems to prefer to go on with its playing, even
with the most sacred treasures on nature's altar. Childlike,
it moans if it scorches its fingers when grasping the sac
rosanct vessel in which burns the sacred flame. It groans
when sickness follows the quaffing of the holy wine. It
whines when it is taken from its ungodly perilous game. It
rages when it is threatened with retributary action of
nature's exacting laws.8 And it will not see that all its
misery and suffering result from its own stubborn persistence
in remaining ignorant of spiritual principles.
Such ignorance is unavoidable in the infancy and early
youth of a race. But the large portion of humanity that has
racially arrived at the advanced adolescent stage should
now overcome that ignorance. It should know its own
dormant spiritual powers, awaken them, and make them
dominant. It should drop the unsanctioned toying and stop
its wasteful playing with the life force, which is the most
sacred force in nature.

CIVILIZATION
"The progress of civilization seems to
have been unfavorable to the virtue
of chastity."
— Gibbon, Decline and Fall of tks
Roman Empiri, I, fac, 504.
"The energy ... of civilization-man is directed out
wards."1 It is applied to materialistic and intellectual pro
gress at the cost of the spiritual. Thus "our knowledge has
increased but not our wisdom."2 Industrial mechanics have
astoundingly evolved, but not the modes of building
character. "While we are hastening from moment to
moment we have neither leisure nor repose . . . for the
development of character."8
"The stressing of the physical sciences without a corres
ponding cultivation of the spiritual factors has lowered
man's sense of his moral power and responsibility."4 "The
most noxious sign of the blight in the social atmosphere is
the openly increasing laxity of morals."5 In fact, "moral
sense is almost completely ignored by modern society."'
The race may be more intellectual than it ever was, but
it is not more spiritual. "Intellect preponderates. At the
same time . . . consciously hardly any one thinks today
of developing the soul."7 "The great intellectual progress
has been achieved to the detriment of soul life."8 Yet "it is
the character of the soul which determines man's level."*
Man has learned to control many of nature's forces. But
as long as he can not control the forces within himself there
can be no question of real civilization. "Control of appetites
is the first step in human culture.""
"As regards his sexual ethics man has . . . retro
graded."" Although a milder mannerism in sexual expres
sion has been adopted by mankind, it has not become less
sensual ; rather the opposite. "Human culture . . . has not

carried things further than the putting of a finer polish on
. . . our animal impulses."11 "The effort of our civilization
has been to domesticate lusts"13, and now they are found
and fostered in almost every home. "In comparison with -
the mode of life which prevailed among mankind for
thousands of years we people of the present day are living
in a very immoral age."14 "Sexual morals have been cast
aside."15 "Sexual license would seem to be the unwritten
code of modern society."1* "We find ourselves ... in a
welter of urban sensualism and immorality.""
Sex tends to permeate to such an extent man's mental
and emotional as well as physical existence that "sex and
its expression have become an obsession"18 ; and the present
generation stands practically indicted as one of sex-addicts.
Characteristically one finds in this age of boasted
culture: society saturated with sexual abuses from the
bottom to the top ; prostitution flourishing on a Gargantuan
scale; white slave traffic amongst the fastest growing
crimes19; abduction and seduction as daily occurrences;
"criminal assaults upon children . . . greatly increased"80 ;
abortions more frequent than at any period, and as lightly
looked upon as is the extraction of a tooth ; sexual relation
ships among students of colleges and schools; "epidemics
of venereal diseases ... in highschools"21 ; widespread
indulgence in perverse sex practices by old and young, even
the very young; sex plays on stage and screen attracting
largest audiences; sex novels finding the best market;
sophistical sex teachings disseminated without restriction,
their popularity resulting from the fact that they provide
excuses for personal weaknesses ; and such a prevalence of
male and female troubles that it would seem that 'civiliza
tion' inevitably spells 'syphilization'.
"Mere animalistic sex expression has no more place in
worthwhile civilization than would mud-huts serve as
modern houses."" But in our pseudo-civilization worse than
animalistic sex misuses are indulged in and condoned.*3
There can be no question of real civilization until a re
lentless campaign against the domination of sex is well on
its way. A lessening of the overwhelming influence of sex

is necessary before the race can claim a semblance of true
culture and of becoming spiritualized.
It is just because spirituality has been practically dis
carded that sensuality has become paramount ; for there is
a close relation, in inverse ratio, between the two: only
where the one is absent can the other rule.
Hence the great need of consciously and conscientiously
approaching a spiritualizing ideal. In themselves "ideals
. . . testify to a high level of civilization"" — particularly
when they help to bring the spiritual nature to the fore, the
animal nature to the background of human consciousness.
Therefore "human nature . . . must be modified according
to a definite ideal."25 And the needed ideal must in the
first place diminish the overpowering fascination of sex.
Because "it is not possible to develop . . . civilization
unless we can inhibit primitive passions"28, "there is as yet
no civilized society."" Above all other responsibilities "the
task of humanity is to build up a genuine civilization, a
corpus spirituale of mankind"28 — a civilization in which
a purified love, disentangled from all sexual accretions, will
come into its own.

IV
EVOLUTION
"Evolution if . . . the triumph of hu
man qualities over animal qualities."
— Kropotkin, Ethics, x,254.
Whether or not the materialistic theories about it are in
every way correct, "evolution is a fundamental element in
life."1 "It is a change forward and upward'", "an advancing
from the imperfect to the perfect."3 Many however mistake
the growth of our civilization for evolutionary progress and
think of these two processes as being synonymous. But they
are neither equivalent nor always parallel.
Evolution brings with it a proportionate degree of true
civilization. But civilization as we know it is not in every
respect the outcome of evolution. Our civilization is largely
the result of an exclusive development of mind, of a one
sided attention to matter and to material life at the cost of
spiritual development. High mental efficiency is only then a
characteristic of harmonious evolution when it concurs with
commensurate spiritual unfoldment. Evolution will then
not only make man scientific, but — by letting his unfolding
faculties find expression through a spiritualized mind — it
will make him approach omniscience.
Overdeveloped brain power however, applied exclu
sively to material science, is as little a natural concomitant
of or an aid to allround evolutionary growth as are over
developed muscles. Therefore most of the remarkable in
tellects of this day and most of the modern inventors with
their astounding accomplishments can not be considered to
be products of normal evolution. They are more like hot
house products of an abnormal civilization. They are the
outcome of a forced and artificial growth of lopsided quali
ties, carried on through many generations. They are in the
human kingdom what exceptionally trained animals are in
the sub-human. They are no samples of evolutionary
growth toward the superhuman.*

Evolution i i
Civilization as it is distinctly constitutes a hindrance to
spiritual unfoldment. In its concentration on materialistic
and mental achievements it neglects and suppresses the
inner development of man. It antagonizes the higher ex
pression of the life force which evolution seeks to bring
about.
It is for this reason that our present civilization is on
its way to follow the fate of most preceding civilizations.
They reached a high state of mental development and of
material well-being. Then, when their materialism together
with its attendant lack of morality nullified their value in
the evolutionary scheme by antagonizing the unfoldment
of the spiritual element, they were inexorably destroyed.
Total destruction of our own civilization can be pre
vented only if cognizance is taken of the spiritual demands
of evolution.
Evolution is nature's process of allowing the latent quali
ties of the life force to come gradually into perfect mani
festation. For this purpose she constructs ever more suitable,
more responsive, more delicate living instruments through
which to express always more of her own innermost being,
more of that unfathomable element which we call spirit.
In the simplest physical forms of the mineral kingdom
nature can only manifest what seems to us unconscious
existence. In the plants — which rise above the minerals,
out of and above the ground — the life force stirs and
shows a consciousness of sentient living. In the animals —
which might be called uprooted plants, growing by motion
and by emotion above the animal kingdom — life expresses
itself in instinctive consciousness. In present humanity —
grown mentally above the animals — life's energy displays
itself in a conscious realization of self-consciousness.
Could this rudimental humanity as it now is be the
climax of the evolutionary scheme? Of course not. "Man
as we know him is by no means the highest creature that
will be evolved."5 "There is not the slightest reason for
supposing that the powers . . . which we human beings
happen to possess are the highest of which this planet is

capable."8 "Progress is the law of life, man is not Man as
yet."7 The process of progress must continue until nature
can perfectly reveal its highest powers in a perfected instru
ment. A superhumanity must be developed which realizes
an untrammeled expression of spiritual consciousness.
At the primitive human stage there came a change in
the evolutionary method.
Pre-human progress was involuntary. But "human
progress can be willed"8 — nay, it must be willed. So far
growth had been regular and automatic, unopposed. It
might have continued thus if man (that is: the human
species) had not used self-consciousness to foster self-indul
gence and sensuality. He thereby set up an impediment
which he himself must again undo by self-chosen, willing
effort. Instead of continuing mechanically from without,
growth has become an accomplishment that must be aided
from within. "Further evolution . . . will result solely
from conscious efforts towards growth."9 It can be achieved
only through persistent self-exertion. Henceforth "man,
not striving toward evolution . . . not helping
it,
will not
evolve. And the individual who
is
not evolving .
.
. goes
down, degenerates . .
.
This
is
the general law."10
The choice
is
man's. Will he successfully progress
toward the succeeding stage of fully spiritualized humanity,
and finally to that of divinized superhumanity, then he must
with self-determination overcome the obstacles to growth.
"
"Divinity
is
in us
;
animality hampers and constricts
it,
stunting our growth."11 Especially "sexual activity weakens
man ... in his most essential, his spiritual expression."1'
"If the race
is
to progress ...
it
must somehow become
- less sexual"13
;
for even "the potentiality of
a
higher spiritual
life ...
is
endangered by fleshly lust."14
Human evolution cannot proceed unless man sets him
self to the task of overcoming the passions which obstruct
-
his spiritual unfoldment. "He who shall attain to perfec
tion must be one who
.
. . has courage to be absolutely
chaste."18

V
THE DEADLOCK IN HUMAN
EVOLUTION
"The strength of the sexual appetite
. . . is unquestionably the great ob
stacle to the improvement of the
race."
— Newton, The Better Way, 15.
Human evolution has been at a standstill for many
thousands of years. As far as we can look back into history
and compare ourselves with the human elements of ancient
civilizations, no evolutionary progress is noticeable. Our
bodies have, if anything, deteriorated. Human qualities
have not improved. Character, emotions, and motives for
action have remained very much the same. "Our materials
for knowledge have increased, but not our intellectual
capacity."1 The intellectual power of our brainiest con
temporaries does not surpass that of a Homer or a Hermes,
or of purported Atlantean illuminati. Of any thing beyond
intellect there still occurs only sporadically no more than an
almost negligible indication.
Since we can trace no noticeable advance in human
evolution within a measurable period, it may well be pre
sumed that at some time in the past a seemingly insurmoun
table obstacle has been erected which has checked our
evolution. Some powerful factor must have prevented the
life force from rising to new and higher outlets.
Even a cursory survey of the progress of the expression
of life energy in pre-human as well as in human vehicles
will help to discover the nature and the cause of the obstruc
tion in the path of our evolution.
A fundamental difference between various stages of
evolutionary growth lies in the ways in which the life force
is being utilized. In all organisms, from the simplest to the
most complicated, the action of the life force is sustained

The Deadlock in Human Evolution 15
by nutrition (which in a wider sense includes respiration).
All functions other than nutrition, instead of sustaining,
consume some of the available life energy.
In the smallest and simplest creatures, such as uni
cellular bacteria, life's energy is utilized in but a single way :
in fast multiplication. "A bacterium is all germ-plasm, all
reproductive material."1 Under favorable conditions hun
dreds of billions of specimens can descend from a single one
in a twenty-four hour period.'
Out of the unicellular beings nature has gradually
evolved the multicellular and complex creatures in which
groups of cells are differentiated for special purposes. In the
jellyfish, for instance, parts of the body's surface have
protruded and grown into grasping and feeling extensions.
Other cells of the skin have become receptive to impressions
of light, preparing what later becomes an eye. And so with
other rudimental organs of the senses. Within the body
an incipient muscular and
'
a still diffuse nervous system
have begun to take shape. Body-growth, muscular exertion,
and the nascent faculty of perception of the external world
require a goodly share of the life energy which in the lowest
forms was monopolized by reproduction. At the stage of the
jellyfish reproduction is still profuse, though not comparable
with that of bacteria. Fast multiplication remains neces
sary wherever destructive factors cause a high rate of
accidental deaths; but as a rule this need diminishes as
evolution of the form proceeds, and new and higher facul
ties are being developed.
At the more elaborately organized stage of the reptiles
the most striking functional change that by then stands out
as having been accomplished is the centralization of the
nervous system. The spinal cord has been definitely estab
lished ; and at the head-end of the cord the cerebellum is
ready to register impressions. Its functioning and that of
the entire improved nervous system required an additional
amount of nervous energy. The new demand for this
specialized form of the life force — which again had to be
taken from what at earlier stages would have remained
available for the reproductive system — necessarily caused
reproduction to be slowed down.

i6 The Coiled Serpent
Ascending the scale of being to the mammals, we find
the cerebrum or fore-brain developed to a certain extent.
As above stated, the reptiles had the cerebellum or hind-
brain; but "its activities are considered as not entering
consciousness."4 Provided with a be it only slightly active
cerebrum, the mammals become conscious of sense-impres
sions, and therewith capable of more strongly sensed emo
tional responses to impressions from the outside. Again, with
the introduction of these newer functions life energy is
transferred from the reproductive organs to the brain ; and
reproduction is considerably diminished.
Between the evolutionary stage of the highest developed
animal and that of man there is a gap so far as scientific
knowledge about it is concerned — an unfathomable dark
cleft. It looks as though evolution at this point, quite
against its customary gradual procedure, had taken a sud
den and bold leap. Before following it in that hypothetical
jump across the canyon of 'missing links' a critical look
back over the covered ground may well be taken.
The point that stands out prominently is that originally
the entire flow of life's energy was directed toward reproduc
tion. Inherently, from that time on, the reproductive prin
ciple has held a first claim on the life force. Every new
function of the evolving organisms could be introduced only
at the cost of reduced reproduction. The energy needed for
each new evolutionary acquisition had to be diverted from
the earlier established reproductive tendency, and to be
transformed into other modes of expression. The life force
had to be used more and more for inward instead of for
outward purposes.
All the way up through the animal kingdom this process
was made easy by the absolute power of instinct, which un
failingly guides all animals in their every activity in har
mony with the plan of evolution." The animal is bound to
follow that guidance because it has no faculty, no power of
its own, with which to oppose nature's will and purpose.
Thus it was an easy matter for the evolving animal to
yield more and more of its reproductive energy and activity
to the needs of higher and higher evolutionary attainments.

The Deadlock in Human Evolution 17
Now : the human stage.
Mind, reason, intellect, conscious self-consciousness are
the evolutionary characteristics of the human species.
Thanks to a far better developed brain than possessed by
any group in the animal kingdom, these new factors can
function in man.
The additional brain development has been made pos
sible by nature by instituting a long period of childhood,
followed by years of adolescence before maturity is fully
reached. To make the most of the evolutionary advantages
and possibilities it is evident that in the first place youth, up
to full maturity, should conserve all of life's energy for the
development of body and of brain.'
But after maturity has been reached the law of evolution
does not cease to require more and more transmuted energy
at every forward step. For the adult as truly as for youth,
for the married' as truly as for the unmarried, further pro
gress in evolution can only be attained at the cost of dimin
ished sexual activity. In some of the higher animal species
this had already been reduced to as little as a single act in
the season of rut, which in many cases occurs only once a
year. For human beings, then, a still further reduction — a
limitation to the few occasions when propagation is con
sciously willed — is requisite if evolution is to proceed.
In the human body nature continues to be lavish with
the production of seed as a storage battery of life force. But
more insistently than ever the evolutionary law demands
that — except for limited generative use — the force be
kept within the body for regenerative purposes.1
For mankind this has been always a most perplexing
problem. "Man is the first product of evolution to be ca
pable of controlling evolutionary destiny.'" Endowed as he
is with reasoning powers, he must independently decide up
on his own behavior, without the compelling guidance by
instinct. Supplied with mind, he is expected to cooperate
consciously with nature in her further evolutionary program.
Unfortunately humanity has arrantly failed to make a
serious effort to promote its own further progress. Instead
of using the power of the mind to understand the respon
sibilities which freedom from blind obedience to instinct

entails, mankind has refused to listen whenever it was re
minded of the requirements of the evolutionary law. It was
so much easier to lend an ear to the promptings of desire,
which was an unknown element up to the human stage.10 It
must have been very soon after the acquisition of mental
self-consciousness and his becoming aware of stirrings of
primitive impulses, that man began to use the mind to stimu
late the desires of the body. In this way he has indulged the
almost negligible sexual impulse which he inherited from the
animal kingdom, until it has become a desire so strong that
he has difficulty to control it.
Overstimulated by this unnaturally strong desire of his
own making, man has looked for arbitrary ways in which to
gratify it. Although reducing actual reproduction, he has
discovered ways of unreproductive sexual action. But every
such act, whatever form it takes, is a misuse of sex and uses
up some of the life force that should be utilized for the
support and the development of higher faculties. "The
record of our race progress clearly shows how our upward
movement has been checked ... by that misuse."11
At the time when mankind became accustomed and
addicted to sexual acts without reproductive purpose, at that
very time it put a deadlock into the course of its evolution.
Not until this deadlock is removed can humanity, individu
ally and jointly, stride on toward the attainment of the
greater faculties and powers which evolution has in store
for man."

VI
THE IDEAL
"The ideal man is . . . non-attached
to his bodily sensations and lusts."
— Huxley, Ends and Means, i,4-
Amongst those who give this subject serious thought
practically "every one today admits that our sexual life is
far from perfect."1 But instead of attempting to perfect it
by lifting it to the level of an ideal, the majority tries to
lower that life to a cunningly intensified sensual gratifica
tion. The general tendency is to idolize its imperfections,
even to worship at the shrines of its deformed images. And
the only effort to counteract this degrading idolatry consists
in an occasional ineffective mumbling by would-be moralists
about so-called moderation.
The genuine doctrine of moderation deals with the
elements contributing to evolutionary growth. It teaches
avoidance of lopsided development. It warns against ex
tremes in physical training, in rigidity of asceticism, in re
ceptive sensitiveness, in compassionate emotions, in intel
lectuality, in philosophical abstraction, in spiritual medita
tion — all of which are necessary factors that must be
practised, but that must be kept in balance with each other
if harmonious evolution is to be attained. The world how
ever has avidly grasped and misconstrued the doctrine of
moderation in evolutionary elements, and applied it to its
own anti-evolutionary tendencies to self-gratification. The
ideal doctrine has been degraded into an excuse for personal
habits and weaknesses, every individual proclaiming that
his particular standard of pandering to these can serve as a
model of moderation.
Not moderation, but elimination is the ideal in regard
to evolution-retarding habits. In a sanitarium for dope-
addicts it may be advisable to allow patients temporarily
a restricted — but at the same time gradually diminishing
— use of narcotics. Similarly it may be advisable to condone

that sex-addicts (that is to say: all those who have habitu
ated themselves to sexual acts) do not suddenly break their
habit, provided they will gradually overcome it. But no sane
person can opine that a continuous use of drugs should be
prescribed for the dope-addicted patients — not even in a
so-called moderate degree. Still less that it should also be
recommended for those who are free from the addiction.
As little reasonable is it to claim that quasi moderate sexual
activity must continually be indulged in by those who are
addicted to such acts, and that also it should be recom
mended for all who are not so addicted.
Once realizing that the sexual life of humanity is far
from faultless, it becomes imperative to look impersonally
and unbiased for a way out of its unsound condition.
Evidently two pathways lie ahead: one leading up out
of entanglement, the other down and deeper into it. Man
must either climb toward the radiant, though seemingly
lonesome summit, or slide into the tempting shadows of the
crowded lower path. The one path is the way of self-control,
of mastery over sex, leading to purity and progress; the
other is the road of self-indulgence, of enslavery to sex, of
passion and resultant retrogression.
One must either recognize that sexual intercourse is not
essential to individual well-being*, and encourage conti
nence ; or acknowledge the regular necessity of such inter
course for all who are physically mature, and frankly sanc
tion licentiousness. Sexual acts must either be limited to
propagation, or perversion5 must be condoned. There must
be either a sane and sanitary living, or there will be a wider
spreading of venereal disease.4 If there is no purification,
there is bound to be purification.
On the one path there is ethical refinement", clarifica
tion of the mind6, and general regeneration ; on the other,
moral decay, mental retardation and allround degeneration.
Either a transmutation of the sex force will bring spiritual
expansion; or continued transgression of natural law will
dull the already acquired, and limit all chance of developing
higher faculties.

The Ideal 21
Man must either consciously help evolution and make
every effort to ascend to the superhuman state7 ; or he will
stubbornly counteract and undo the work of evolution, and
thereby descend below the grade of the sub-human state.
Every human being has the choice between those two
paths. "Every individual ... must belong either to the
side which is in favor of purity, or to the fraction which
practises and advocates sensuality."8
Which of the two will lead to a more desirable, more
worthy, more ideal humanity? "Which must we choose and
follow? ... A voice from within in each case definitely
and clearly gives the answer; and all that is left for moral
philosophy to do is to give it the form of a universal rational
principle."9
Such a principle is contained in the following formula :
FOR ADVANCED EVOLUTIONARY GROWTH PASSION MUST BE
CONQUERED AND THE GENERATIVE ORGANS BE USED FOR GEN
ERATION only. In other words : all the sex force not actually
used for the perpetuation of the species must by transmuta
tion be made available for higher evolutionary attainment.
The sexual life to which the application of this formula
leads is a spiritualized and impersonal one — a life in which
the personality's actions are ruled by spiritual motives, and
in which the selfish longings of the body, of the senses or
of the mind cannot be allowed to play any part.
As an ideal this applies to all. Albeit not within im
mediate reach of every individual, as a final destination it
is the same for all. It is "an ideal that is set to us as a task :
we must strive toward
it,
even
if
its realization
is
beyond our
power."10 For
a
majority
it
may be so far away that
it
seems unattainable indeed. But
a
close approach to its
attainment
is
possible for quite
a
number. In individual
cases
it
has been successfully approached, always concurring
with commensurate spiritual growth.
Amongst those who have fully realized this ideal in the
past are some who have left imperishable impressions of
spiritual greatness on human history. They, the wisest
teachers that ever trod the earth, stand out as exemplars
of what mankind can be and of what
it
is
destined to be

when it grows spiritually mature. In the process of that
growth all humanity must gradually conquer passion, must
gradually diminish the abuse of sex.
Eventually the ideal of purity must be seen and recog
nized and ultimately reached by all, if the race is to rise
from its wearisome condition of the human-animal to the
felicitous spiritual-human state. Every individual must face
the basic facts. Understanding these, one must choose the
ideal as a goal ; and the will must consciously be applied to
approximate that goal as rapidly as possible. A beginning
must be made by every one some time. To deny this is to
deny oneself the chance for evolutionary progression.
Once one's aspirations are concentrated upon the ideal,
its distant glimmering becomes more and more distinct and
more irresistibly attractive. Approaching it from wherever
one may stand, every conscious step in its direction edifies,
until consummate attainment well-nigh deifies.
All this may seem to many too idealistic. But ideals of
today are realities of the future . Undeniably, "the ideal is
remote . . . but he who will not attain it will fare well for
having striven after it."11

CONSIDERATIONS
"There are certainly a number of
highly rational arguments against
. . . passion."
— Foerster, Marriage and the Sex
ProbUm,lIjx,3o8.
Not being a text-book, this work does not attempt to be
either complete or systematic. It is more in the nature of
a test-book : one in which the genuineness of the proffered
ideal concerning the importance of conservation of repro
ductive energy is being tested on the touchstone of widely
diversified subjects. Science and metaphysics, sociology and
ethics, and philosophical and religious systems of all times
are lightly touched upon, at a single point, for the purpose
of substantiating the ideal and of proving its intrinsic value.
In almost every direction evidence can be found in corro
boration of the ideal of purity.
A perusal of the following four-score chapters will reveal
how widespread and how well supported is the view that
the evolutionary development of body, of intellect, of every
cultural attainment, of spirituality and of hidden powers
largely depends upon the conservation and transformation
of sexual energy.
Where each chapter deals with a single subject, each
presents but a single argument or suggests only a single
consideration. Therefore one chapter by itself may or may
not prove strikingly convincing. But each in some way
serves to strengthen all the others; each chapter contains
a contribution to the central theme of the book.
All statements made or quoted can not be equally strong,
and they are not expected to be always generally accepted.
More likely than not even the most conclusive remarks
would be rejected anyhow by the multitude which clings
to its addiction to sensuous gratification. Evidently "least
of all can I hope for approbation from those who are . . .

under the power of passion."1 "For he that lives at the
dictates of passion will not hear nor understand the reason
ing of one who tries to dissuade him."1 "Passion seems not
to be amenable to reason."3 It is still true that "this lower
principle in man would not listen to reason and . . . would
never naturally care for any arguments."4
After all "each man can only prize that which to a
certain extent is analogous to him, and for which he has at
least a slight inclination."5 Therefore the thoughts expressed
in these pages are intended mainly for those who have
become already somewhat receptive to spiritual principles.
Even to those perhaps not all the arguments presented in
favor of the ideal will appeal. But if by logic or by intuitive
reaction they find that the cumulative evidence of be it only
half a dozen chapters seems convincing, then that should
suffice to plant the seed of the ideal in their consciousness.
Nearly every one who is willing to face the evidence
frankly and squarely will have to acknowledge that the ideal
is based on a deep, solid stratum of universal truth. And
once this recognition is rooted, a little regular attention
will make it grow and bloom and bear the refreshing and
rejuvenating fruit which brings a taste of spiritual
realization.

VIII
SPIRIT VERSUS MATTER
"The law of spirit ... is to go up ;
the law of matter ... is to go down."
— Saint-Martin, Oeuvres Posthumes,
1.3 "2.
In their final essence "spirit and matter are only opposite
poles of the same universal substance."1 As the primary
expression of nature's law of polarity, without which the
universe could not exist, they are "states of one unity,
divided only in our conception of the modes of its mani
festation."1
On this point the deepest philosophies, the highest occult
teachings, the broadest religious viewpoints and the farthest
reaching scientific searchings seem to lead to very similar
conclusions. They have come to look upon spirit and matter
as being basically one single element which from one form
of expression can be transmuted into another by changing
its rate of vibration. "Regarded concretely, spiritual and
material being are two kinds of energy which can be trans
formed into each other, just as mechanical motion can be
transformed into heat and vice versa."3
If looked upon in the same analytical way, steam and
ice are basically one and the same thing ; but in every-day
talk and for practical purposes they remain definitely dis
tinguishable and as good as opposites. Their relative op
position and yet basic unity may be indicated by calling ice
the lowest form of that of which steam is a higher manifes
tation. And so may matter be called the lowest form of that
of which spirit is the highest expression.
Only the exceptional mind can occasionally contemplate
and still more rarely entirely grasp the ultimate reality of
oneness. For a perfect understanding of the state of unity
we first "must escape from matter, which is but an inferior
form of spirit"4 ; that is to say, we must escape from the crys
tallizing power that matter holds over us. For the average

human intellect the standpoint of duality is the more logi
cal, the only comprehensible. Therefore spirit and matter
are for the present purposes dealt with as antithetical.
Justification for considering matter low and spirit high
can be found mainly in a comparison of their rates of vibra
tion : that of matter and its qualities is low and slow, while
that of spirit and its attributes is high and fast beyond mea
sure, beyond imagination.
Wherever two of different rates of speed are linked to
gether, as spirit and matter inextricably are, there is conflict,
push and struggle, strife for supremacy. Thus spirit and
matter are in constant conflict with each other ; spirit always
pushes onward and matter is holding back. But about the
final outcome of their contest there cannot be a doubt : the
quicker always ultimately wins, in the evolutionary arena as
in the wrestling-ring.
In the end matter—which expresses the static power of
solidification, of separateness, of selfishness and of sensuous-
ness —is fated to be vanquished by spirit, whose dynamic
power is that of expansion, of unification, of self-effacement
and of sublime purity.
"In that victory of spirit over matter . . . matter is not
destroyed but is made ... an instrument of the activity of
spirit."5 Matter will then no longer oppose, but support
spirit ; it will become spiritualized itself, and will manifest
only that which is in accord with spirit, namely: absolute
purity in every expression of life.
"Such purity is necessary if real spirituality is to be at
tained."8

EMBODIED SPIRIT
"Man is a human being only if he
conquers nature by spirit."
■
— Keyserlino, Book of Marriage,
111,308.
In humanology the clashing cosmic elements of spirit and
matter are represented by the human "spirit, which is the
. . . emanation from the divine, and the body with its
various desires and passions, which is of the nature of
matter."1 And as cosmically matter is lower than spirit by
reason of its lower rate of vibration, so the physical human
body is lower than the indwelling spirit.
Everything that increases the power of matter over man
makes the body denser, lower in vibration and less fit to
serve as an instrument for spirit. Even the body's finest
organs high in the skull become thereby less accessible to
spirit.
The attraction of matter is most powerful in the organs
in the lower part of the trunk. Hence there are good reasons
for designating the sexual tendency as belonging to man's
lower nature. It is this lower nature with its animal qualities
that must be conquered by the spirit within man in order
that he may become a truly human being. "The binding
of the lower is necessary in order that the higher may act.
To give a clear definition of the spirit in man seems, alas,
impossible. Mere words cannot correctly define it because
"since it is spirit ... it can be comprehended only spirit
ually."3 As long as man is "controlled by carnality . . .
there is nothing in him that can touch or sense spirit, and
therefore he cannot be conscious of it."4 Very few possess
the needed faculty of spiritual comprehension. And few
are they who are willing to take up the rigid training neces
sary for the acquisition of that faculty — probably just be
cause for this purpose "the lower faculties . . . require to
be strictly governed by the higher."5

30 The Coiled Serpent
Those wise ones who had acquired the faculty of spiritual
comprehension have stated in different ways but always
"with absolute certainty that essentially we are spirit"";
that we are not a body which may or may not have a soul,
but that we are a soul (or individualized spirit) incidentally
using a body ; that "the body is but an instrument existing
for the use and sake of the soul, and not for itself."7 But to
prove this to ourselves "we have to discover the spirit in
us by stripping off all that is extraneous to it ... A
strictly ethical discipline is insisted on ... an absolute in
ward purity demanding self-mastery and self-renunciation"8,
in the first place a renunciation of everything that increases
the power of matter over spirit. "If we wish to become
spiritually developed we must . . . become rid of our
sensuality and passions."9
As expressed in the language of a somewhat orthodox
moral philosophy, which none the less is basically true:
"if the spirit ... is to increase in power, the flesh must
be subdued."10 "As long as the satisfaction of the appetites
and lusts of the flesh is included in man's ideals and aims,
he never can rise above the plane of animalism."11 'Flesh'
here refers to man's "material nature which violates . . .
the spirit, is opposed to and exclusive of it."1s And since
"the predominance of flesh over spirit expresses itself most
strongly ... in the carnal union"13, the first step towards
giving supremacy to spirit is to master the sexual urge.
It is "the grossness of all the matter in which material
man consists . . . which holds the soul in continual imper
fection."14 "Our body . . . fills us with desires and passions
and vain imaginings . . . and a host of frivolities."15 But
once "having got rid of the foolishness of the body, we shall
be pure . . . and know the clear light of truth."18 "Who
then would not . . . strive to wean himself by degrees
from the domination and insolence of this flesh?"
However, to subdue the flesh does not mean that the
body should be despised or stunted or neglected. "The true
attitude toward the body will be one neither of contempt
nor of weak pandering to its impulses."18 The whole trend

of evolution shows a tender care on nature's part in the
building of better, finer, higher organized bodies, through
which spirit can ever more fully express itself. We can help
evolution, not by neglecting the body but by disciplining
and purifying
it,
by bringing its vibrations up to
a
higher
standard, "by refining and subliming
it,
and so heightening
its powers as to make
it
sensitive and responsive to all the
manifestations of the spirit."19 "The body

flesh itself becomes spiritualized in proportion to the inner
growth of its bearer."" Only by resolutely improving and
perfecting
it
as an instrument for spirit can we, while living
in
a
physical body, hope to know and consciously express
the priceless faculties of spirit.

THE SEX PRINCIPLE
"Sex is a thing of bodies, not of
souls."
— Hermes, Exeerpti by Stobaeus,
xxvi,44.
"It has been commonly imagined that sex is a primal fact
rooted in the very constitution of life, if not indeed of the
universe . . . But there is nothing of that fundamental
character about the device of sexual reproduction."1
Strictly, sex is only that which physically distinguishes
female from male. It is but one of the manifold manifesta
tions of nature's unfathomable law of polarity. So also is
electricity in its positive and negative poles; so is music in
its polar opposites of major and minor ; so are the contrasts
of spirit and matter, of day and night, of repulsion and
attraction. Innumerable are the expressions of polarity, of
which sex is but one instance.
To reverse this statement and to say that all polarity is
1 educible to sex is the specious reasoning of a race mentality
so pervaded with thoughts of sex that it seeks to sexualize
everything. Thus the idea of sex often has been connected
with the most abstract concepts, including deity. Unfor
tunately some of the deepest metaphysical dissertations have
used the words 'male' and 'female' in reference to positive
and negative forces in nature and to other polar opposites
far above the physical plane. This may have been done in
order to make the difficult abstract ideas more readily
understood by the average mind ; but with it all it has con
tributed to the widespread misunderstanding that sex
implies more than a physical differentiation. But apart
from that material distinction "nature knows no more of a
male and a female principle than of a vertebrate and in
vertebrate principle.'"
Whatever seemingly important place one may be in
clined to assign to sex in individual physical existence, from

The Sex Principle 33
a higher standpoint one can see in it no more than "a mere
temporary expression on the physical plane of the pairs of
opposites"1, "merely an adventitious . . . adaptation."4
Spiritually considered we are not 'men' or 'women' ; we are
spirit, using — and using only temporarily — a male or a
female body. "It cannot be too emphatically reiterated that
the sex function exists only on the physical plane"5, and
that "it is only in the body that sex exists.'" "There is no
sex in mind."7 Also "souls have no sex."8 Still less can there
be any question of sex in the spirit. From which it follows
that as one grows in spirituality sex loses its importance.
Abundant as may be the neo-psychological and the
erotically romantic and poetical attempts to put sex and its
function on a hallowed pedestal, only a sense-dimmed vision
can lead to the belief that this is where it rightfully belongs.
Sex being only a characteristic of the physical body, every
sexual gratification sustains the body in its resistance against
a fuller manifestation of spirit.
Before considering sex to be man's "crowning glory'"
and his "most godlike possession"10, one may well take into
account that every pig and every insect shares in the imagi
nary glory of that same possession which does not in any way
crown man as different from the lowest animal. "The re
productive process ... is still an essentially animal func
tion."11 "True spirituality demands its utter extirpation."11
Man's truly godlike possession lies in the possibility of
spiritual development. Not in sex. On the contrary, "the
absolutely spiritual man is . . . entirely disconnected from
sex."11
( Sexual reproduction has often been regarded as an
expression of man's creative power. But "reproduction is
not . . . creation."14 Even the purest sexual act, even on
those rare occasions when it is performed with propagative
intention, is not creative. The male's part in the act is at
best no more creative than the action of a husbandman who
sows, depending entirely upon nature to produce a harvest.
"The seed is deposited in the womb, and another cause takes
it,
operates
it,
and moulds
a
child."15

34 The Coiled Serpent
Moreover, the comparison of the male's role with that
of a sower is still too flattering ; and to say that "the woman
in her conception and generation is but the imitation of the
earth"18, is not giving her sufficient recognition for hers.
For she represents not only the earth, but the earth with the
seed, the ovum, already in it. The male, far from exerting
any creative power, is required to furnish only a fecundating
element, which perchance it may become possible to provide
without him. "The spermatozoon can be replaced by a
chemical or physiological agent. Only the female element
is essential." t
No, not in sex lies man's creative power. What is usually
spoken of as procreation is not in any way a manifestation
of creative faculties of the procreators. No human being
knows how to create the seed, nor how to make it grow into
a living being. Procreation is a physical expression belong
ing to the animal part of man — whereas creation belongs to
a higher, as yet practically unmanifested part in him.
"The only true creative function is that of . . . the
faculty of formative thought."18 Creative power is that
which consciously makes the subjective objective, by
exercise of intensely concentrated thought. It goes far
beyond what is so often considered to be the creative power
of artists, who even at their best are but extremely skilful
artisans giving more or less perfect physical form to what
they observe in visible objects, or to what in moments of
inspiration may have been impressed on them.1' The real
power of creation rests in the mind. And it can manifest
only after the mind has been freed from any connection
with sex, and has become indissolubly linked with spirit.

PURPOSE OF SEX
"The real purpose . . . propagation
of the species."
— Krafft-Ebino, Psychopathia Sex-
ualis,i,g.
Nature — or whatever one may wish to call that force
which manifests in the evolution of life and form — needs
in her evolutionary work an almost endless series of genera
tions in order to lead up to the final, perfect form. Through
innumerable generations of minerals, of plants, of animals,
of men, she is leading up to supermen and on beyond.
In all her kingdoms nature has instituted methods of
perpetuating the species "for the purpose that the perfection
which one generation has not reached may be approached
by the next."1 Of every method of reproduction self-evi-
dently reproduction is the natural aim. Thus also "in creat
ing the division of the sexes . . . nature has only one aim
— the continuation of life."1 The physical use of physical
organs of reproduction is by nature intended for physical
propagation, and for that purpose only. Certainly "those
powers and instruments and appetites which are subservient
to copulation were imparted to men not for the sake of vo
luptuousness but for the perpetuation of the human race."3
"Inasmuch as the object of the sexual function is the
preservation of the species, the act of copulation should be
performed only at such times and under such circumstances
as subserve that object."4 Sexual action that is not propaga-
tive cannot be considered to be in harmony with nature's
purposes. Every attempt to justify unreproductive sexual
action can only be the result of a wish to whitewash the
addiction of humanity to sexual abuse.5
It is irrational to ascribe to nature the intention that
sex should be used for sense-gratification, where that misuse
is but an invention of the human mind. As well might be
deduced from the existence of poppies and of all such

from this apparently to a hermaphroditic system; out of
which she has developed the method which requires co
operation of two separated sexes. "Man is born in the
present way only as the consequence ... of the law of
natural evolution.'"
Each change was introduced when evolution could be
promoted by a new method of reproduction. The still un
answered question is: why was unisexuality developed in
preference to some other propagative system, and how was
this particular method expected to aid evolution better
than any other.
While the physical aspect of sex is intended exclusively
for propagation, a secondary purpose entirely apart from
the physical must have been part of nature's plan when
instituting the sexual method of reproduction — a purpose
that would aim to advance human evolution in higher
realms simultaneously with that in the physical.
Emotional and mental and spiritual evolution must pro
ceed on parallel lines with that of the physical forms ; and
the evolving form enhances the possibility of higher emo
tional, higher mental and spiritual expression. All of these
are at first much more stimulated by the interdependence of
the two sexes than by the self-centered self-sufficiency of the
preceding undifferentiated and asexual systems of repro
duction.
But the attainment of the secondary purpose does not
depend on physical sex expression. It manifests in the
psychological or superphysical relation of the sexes.
The differentiation of the sexes has left each individual
intact as a soul. Only, where in the one sex a positive
principle has been emphasized while a negative was sub

dued, in the other a negative principle has been strengthened
at the cost of a positive. As a result, the same as in magnetic
poles, there is mutual attraction. And that attraction, which
is not physical but psychological, serves to turn the attention
away from self and from selfishness; it lays the foundation
for loftier emotions, for a tender care of others, for sympathy
and self-sacrifice, for compassion and self-effacement, and
for pure love. And so sex fulfills its secondary purpose by
aiding in the evolutionary task of leading humanity in the
direction of the goal of conscious spiritual unification.
But not by physical union can this non-physical unifica
tion be attained. As soon as the lower organs are sexually
active there can be no question of any spiritual expression,
except if it be in the form of a sacrificial dedication to the
entity that may be born. Apart from this, sex and spirit
uality are diametrically opposed. Every attempt to give the
unreproductive sexual act a quasi sublime appearance is
nothing but self-delusion; it may lead to emotional exu
berance, but never to anything of a spiritual nature, never
to soul unification.
Far from enhancing higher faculties of the soul, each
physical sexual act which lacks propagative consecration
is a deterrent to those faculties. It cannot possibly promote
love, but only lust, which sooner leads to separation than
to unification.7 Instead of aiding, it frustrates spiritual evo
lution; for every such act draws one down into the world
of sense-bound matter from which one should be freed.
Therefore a limiting of sexual action to "the normal
object of the sexual appetite, reproduction"8 will most
effectually advance evolution.

XII
INSTINCT
"The sexual act in human beings is
not instinctive."
— Russell, Marriage and Morals,
Looking back over the path of evolution we see the mineral
kingdom still asleep in nature's womb, the earth; the
vegetable kingdom still connected with its mother, directly
fed through roots; then the helpless animal kingdom as
nature's toddling little child over which she closely watches,
holding it tightly by the hand. By this close, protecting
contact nature's own intelligence unerringly guides the
animal, in which it manifests as instinct.
"Instinct is given to the animals since they have no
understanding."1 In everything they automatically "follow
their instinct, and in doing so they act as nobly . . .
as their position in nature permits." The sexual body-urge
in itself is not instinct; instinct is the power which in the
animals controls that urge, just as it controls their selection
of the right food and their building of a nest, a hive, a web.
Instinct unfailingly directs and restricts their sexuality
which it allows to come into expression only in the season
of rut, purely for the perpetuation of the species. This is
the rule, "unless through association with mankind the
animal has become abnormal in this respect"3, in which
case the power of instinct is interfered with.
From her older child, from humanity, nature has with
drawn her guiding hand. Instead of instinct she has im
planted in man mind, which is an individualized part of her
own intelligence, so that in him "reason has completely
supplanted instinct in the government of conduct."4 "There
exists no instance in normal man of a determinate pure
instinct."5 Not even in the savage. Only the cells and cell-
groups within the body are still directed by instinct to per
form such processes as digestion and the restoration of dam

aged tissue. But all acts of the individual have come entirely
under the control of human volition.
For the direction of human conduct by man himself na
ture has developed in him a brain through which the mind
can find expression. "Instinctive life does not need the
brain."0 Hence below the human stage instinct could be
manifest already before the brain began to be formed ; and
as long as the brain was not sufficiently developed to serve
as an instrument for the mind, instinct remained the regu
lator of conduct. But since individual mind has become ac
tive, instinct has become superfluous. Therefore, anatomi
cally, "as the brain developed, the centers for the older in
stinctive activities were covered over."7 Physiologists of high
repute agree that with the growth of the brain "the place
of instinct . . . was taken by intelligent educability"8, and
soon "intellectual powers . . . had the effect of superse
ding those of instinct.'"
Surely then, man's overstrong sexual urge cannot be ex
cused by ascribing it to instinct — to an influence from
which he has been cut off in the dim past. No instinct is
either urging or restraining him. The cause lies entirely in
himself, in his abuse of mind.
Part of mind's mission was to take over nature's task of
judicious direction and restriction of the sexual urge. But
instead of using his reasoning power for this purpose man —
becoming conscious of self-seeking, sense-serving, sex-stirring
possibilities — applied his mentality to the distortion of the
sexual life. In the exercise of reason presumably rational,
intelligent man "descends below the level of the beasts . . .
because he puts his intellect at the service of bestiality."10
"He calls it reason, but pollutes its use by being beastlier
than any brutes."11
It is believed that "the pairing of our earliest human
or half-human ancestors . . . was restricted to a certain
season of the year"1*, "and that abstinence was the rule at
other times."" "But . . . the sexual impulse became per
verted through lust."14 "In order to multiply the moments of
[body-] pleasure man acquired the faculty of repeating ge
netic acts during any season."15 This has been detrimental in

several ways. For one thing "it was ... at the cost of the
length of his life."14 The most serious effect has been that
"he is manifesting a degenerative tendency instead of taking
an upward step on the evolutionary scale."17 By his chronic
animalism "man sinks lower than an animal because he lives
in a state of disorder which does not exist among animals."18
Where animals are only sexual, man has become sensual
by degrading the reproductive sexual urge into a desire for
unreproductive sensual satisfaction. Sensuality is man-made.
By overexciting the reproductive faculty for millions of years
man has only himself to blame for the impelling power of
the sexual impulse. And only he himself can reduce that
power and bring it back within the boundaries of its legiti
mate domain : that of the perpetuation of the race.

DESIRE
"The slave of desire is quickly the
victim of lust."
— Riley, Bible of Bibles,vii,2og.
In its widest meaning the word 'desire' may be used to
express a longing for the attainment of any form of satis
faction, be it physical, emotional, intellectual or spiritual —
a longing for anything that can be expected to provide pass
ing pleasure or lasting joy. But in practical application the
use of the word more often than not has been limited to sig
nify a passional emotion for sense-gratification — and here
it will be so used.
Even in this restricted meaning desire does not exist be
low the human stage. Animals are equipped with appetites.
In their natural state they are guided by nature's intelligence
— that
is,
by instinct — to satisfy those appetites for pre
servation of self and of species. They serve nature's need in
a
natural attraction to food or mate without being driven
by desire.
Only in man, endowed with mind and with self-con
sciousness, desire comes into being; for "desire is appetite
with consciousness thereof."1 Instead of being wisely led by
instinct man
is
misled by unwise use of mind and driven by
desire. At the evolutionary stage of average present human
ity mind
is
used in separative, selfish ways and
is
largely
confined to matter; and thus desire, produced by matter-
bound and matter-blinded mind, seeks separative, selfish
and material satisfaction. And "man not only .
.
. satisfies
the desires of the moment, but refines upon them and stimu
lates them"1 by
a
continual misapplication of memory and
anticipation, these two great powers of the mind.
Hence
it
is
that "desire
is
insatiable and
is
always in
want"3, and that "merely natural impulses .
.
. make more
and more demands the more concessions one makes to
them."4 With
it
all, "no attained object of desire can give

lasting satisfaction ; it can produce merely a fleeting grati
fication"5, which only feeds and fosters the desire and makes
it grope for forms of self-indulgence which grow ever more
noxious.
In most cases "the desire lasts long ; the demands are in
finite ; the satisfaction is short.'" And besides, "the satisfied
passion leads oftener to unhappiness than to happiness"7;
so that "so long as we are given up to the throng of desires
... we can never have lasting happiness nor peace."*
Therefore, to do what the ultra-modernists seem to pro
pound, namely "to make desire a final authority ... is to
invite chaos in the inner life"9 ; whereas "to diminish our
desires is the same as to augment our powers."10
Undoubtedly the lower forms of desire have their due
place in the scheme of evolution. As long as humanity was
in a young evolutionary stage such desire was as useful as a
teething ring is for a baby in the teething stage. But the babe
does not need the ring after the teeths cut through — al
though it may want to keep it as a toy. So does humanity
not need the element of desire after the breaking through
of a higher consciousness, although it may want to cling to
its every desire as to a pleasure-producing toy.
At the present time desire still may be the indispensable
motive power for those backward ones who will not move
or work without anticipating sense-satiety as a reward. But
that is not to say that it is still a necessary element for all, or
that it must remain for ever with those who are being helped
by it now.
Sooner or later one begins to see that desire for transitory
things does not and can not bring any permanent satisfac
tion ; and also that "so long as our desires are in conflict with
the universal law we suffer pain"11 ; that not only all "desire
is accompanied by pain"1*, but that desire itself is pain, and
that there is "no pain like passion, no deceit like sense."1'
Then, turning away from the tyranny of selfish sense -
desires, one finds an inner spiritual longing for more lasting
things, an unselfish aspiration for conscious cooperation with
nature's plans and laws which supplies an even more effec
tive motive power for action than desire.

44 The Coiled Serpent
An intuitive knowledge of the reality of a higher form
of human existence, and a longing to attain
it,
become
manifest as one's unselfish efforts increase.
This longing lies deep down within each one, not like
desire fed by misdirected mind but wed to unerring wisdom.
It
is
an essential part of us; yet
is
it
not to many actually
known because "our animal desires
.
.
.
have hidden from
us our true life."14 This
is
"the real misery of man
.
.
.
that
he
is
self-obscured, lost in the midst of his own desires."1'
Hence "the idea that man ought to liberate himself from the
bondage of earthly desires
is
the conclusion of
a
contempla
tive mind reflecting upon the short duration and emptiness
of all bodily pleasures."16 "To expel all eagerness of tem
porary desire
.
. . this is emancipation, and this
is
the free
man's worship."17
It
is
but
a
repetition of the conviction of the greatest
thinkers and of the mystics and the spiritual leaders of all
ages that for every person who wishes to advance in evolu
tion and to attain real happiness there comes
a
time when
"desires must starve
.
. . the animal passions must die."18
"Nothing hinders us so much in the development and
exercise of our inner powers as . . . our external desires."1'
"Those powers .
.
. are even by the slightest application
of desire disturbed and hindered."" Therefore all desire
must eventually perish. But
it
need not perish by the painful
process of being killed by force. By transmutation the lower
desires will automatically shrink, dissolve and vanish. Suf
fering will then yield its place to constant exaltation; for
"freedom from desire
is
like the choicest extract from the
choicest treasure."" "Divine influences will come to him
who liberates his soul of all carnal desires.""

THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE
"Sex today ... is slimed over with
the thought of pleasure."
— Carpenter, Love's Coming of Age,
21.
What a restless, pleasure-craving, pleasure-grasping crowd
humanity has become! "The chief good is supposed by
the multitude to be pleasure."1 Pleasure is made life's
purpose, pleasure its single aim. Not purely recreation but
self-gratification; not merely amusement in the form of
harmless diversion, but such as is detrimental to the indi
vidual and to the race. And "closely connected with the pur
suit of pleasure is the serious increase of sexual license"1;
for "the pleasures of the body are the ones we most often
meet with ; these have usurped the family title."3
Not joy is being sought, not happiness, not gladness —
but sensuous stimulation and gratification, impairing physi
cal and mental health ; for "who that is a slave to [body-]
pleasure is not in an evil condition both as to his body and
his mind?"4 Such pleasure exhausts one's powers, while joy
increases them. Pleasure is usually followed by its opposite,
grief ; while "it is a characteristic of real joy that it never
changes into an opposite"5, because joy is absolute, while
pleasure is but relative.
"The mere sum of pleasures does not constitute happi
ness"9; more often "people are unhappy ... on account
of pleasure."7 In grasping pleasure they may "imagine that
they are finding happiness, whereas they are finding only a
frenzied and incomplete oblivion."8 For that is all that "plea
sure is ... a matter of momentary oblivion'", a chasing of
shadows, an utmost self-delusion. "In pleasure . . . there
is something positively unreal and ungenuine."19 It is no
part of real life. "The pleasure principle . . . prevails over
the reality principle to the detriment of the whole organ
ism."11 While imagining that they amuse themselves in the

The Pleasure Principle 47
pursuit of pleasure, people frequently destroy if not them
selves then at least their chances of perpetual joy.
Well considered, "pleasure is neither good nor useful."11
It melts away the moment it is grasped, leaving naught but
dissatisfaction and emptiness. "This void which we try to
fill by the stimulus of sensations"1' calls ever for more of the
unsatisfying pleasure.
Giving to the word 'pleasure' a wider meaning than that
of indulgence of the body, it becomes necessary to distin
guish degrees of pleasure, supplying either physical or emo
tional or intellectual satisfaction. And "when one gets higher
than the intellect . . . one finds a state of joy in which all
pleasures . . . even of the intellect become as nothing."14
Naturally "the pleasures derived from the higher facul
ties are preferable ... to those of which the animal nature
is susceptible."15 "Pleasures of the mind are more consider
able to one's happiness than . . . pleasures of the body."16
"Bodily pleasures . . . rightly are called slavish"" ; they are
undoubtedly the lowest of all.
Not any person who knows a relatively higher pleasure
would ever want to surrender it for a lesser kind. "Nobody
would choose to retain the mind of a child throughout his
life, even though he could continue to enjoy the pleasures of
childhood to the utmost."18 Still less do they who have found
true joy — of which there is within oneself an unconditioned
and unlimited supply — long to go back to any form of
pleasure the nature of which is to gratify the personality by
limited means, conditioned from without. "They would not
resign what they possess . . . for the most complete satis
faction of all desires."19
"To make pleasure the aim of life is a sure way to de
prive it of all true joy."20 "The moment that reason gets the
upper hand pleasure is discarded."" This is why "the true
philosopher . . . abstains from pleasures."" He sees that
"pleasure is one of the chief things that beguile men from
the higher path"", because "it increases and intensifies the
personality"", which tenaciously holds on to the material
side of life, thus barricading itself against the spirit.

48 The Coiled Serpent
"If you seek pleasures . . . you are as far short of wis
dom as you are short of joy"15 ; "for joy is an elation of the
spirit ; it can be attained only by the wise."16 Only "when
pleasures have been banished, then . . . there comes upon
us a boundless joy that is firm and unalterable."17
The trouble is that in the pursuit of pleasure most people
have conscripted the concrete mind to serve on the side of
the emotions and the senses ; and this rebellious triumvirate
triumphantly sweeps aside all higher-minded and spiritual
considerations.
Each of the three alone — the mind, the emotions or the
senses — could be confuted and induced to join the eleva
ting evolutionary forces; but united, the three-in-one ob
streperously hold on to their contemptuous, tempestuous
reign of gross material pleasure. They thrive impelling man
to snatch at passing pleasure, thwarting his acquisition of
lasting happiness.
Within each human entity, near the high mountain top
of one's own spiritual being, there is a spring of purest joy
compared with which all pleasure drawn from the outside
world is tasteless, drab and disillusioning.
Not without some exertion can that spring be reached.
It lies high above the valley of polar opposites ; to reach it
one must rise above all opposites — hence also rise above
sex. But even though their crops of relative pleasure inevi
tably are followed by inexterminable growths of pain, most
people prefer to remain down in the valley, rather than to
make the effort to climb to the source of absolute joy.
"The spiritual man feels spiritual joy which is superior
to material pleasure, exceeding it a thousand times' ; "he
looks upon the lower satisfactions of life as stranglers of the
real joys."1* When the elating joy from the inner source has
been once tasted, mere pleasure "will become not only un-
craved for but simply and literally repulsive."30 Then all the
childish pleasures of the world will fade away in the joy of
spiritual life ; and "they who have cast away passion . . .
will reach the highest joy."11

XV
THE SENSES
"We are given over to the world of
sense, we neglect the spiritual world."
— Rooer Bacon, Opus Majus,ll,6^2.
If we compare the organization of human nature with
that of an army in the field, the physical senses represent the
outposts which report their findings to the central intelli
gence department. Successful progress depends upon the use
made of the data received from the outposts. An army whose
scouts are permitted to smuggle intoxicating and salacious
supplies into headquarters and into the encampments is
doomed to failure. So is human progress impossible when
the senses are allowed to introduce questionable sensations
into body and mind.
In the course of evolution sense-awareness first came into
expression in the plants, inciting the beginnings of a devel
opment of emotion. In the animals the emotions, stimulated
by physical senses under the control of instinct, laid the foun
dation for a development of mind. In the same way, in order
that evolution may progress, the mind in man should intelli
gently prepare the coming into expression of spirituality. For
this purpose the mind should keep a strict control over the
senses, and train them to a responsiveness to ever higher
vibrations, never permitting them to disrupt the human in
telligence or to carry passion-stirring elements into the sys
tem.
However, in most people the senses are not controlled by
the mind but on the contrary are allowed to dominate it.
Thus "the senses, having mastered reason, have led man
into pursuit of pleasure . . . and lust has become his second
nature."1 Instead of being used to digest the observations of
the senses for the benefit of spiritual growth, the mind of
the majority is made to serve the senses and to encourage
these in a response to the coarsest vibrations. In this way

The Senses
mind and senses have combined to excite the passions of
the body.
Instead of serving as observation outposts for the gui
dance of spiritual evolution, the senses have been enlisted in
the service of sensuous and sensual self-gratification. This
can never be in harmony with evolution, because such grat
ification coarsens the individual instead of refining him ; and
the struggle to acquire for oneself the means of gratification
strengthens separateness and thereby opposes the spiritual
oneness, at a realization of which evolution aims.
Generally "the senses have usurped a place beyond their
station . . . and dominated an organism which is made for
higher activities."2 The majority not only have submitted
to that domination by the senses, but have encouraged it by
"seeking satisfactions almost exclusively through sentient ex
perience"3, and by "depriving the inner man of all power in
order to use it for the outer man."4 "The spiritual faculty
... is closed to most men by the incrustation of the
senses."*
In almost every way "the inclinations of sense . . . are
quite contrary to those of the spirit"" ; if submitted to they
blunt the susceptibility to all sublimer things.
Under the sway of the senses "the whole keyboard of the
emotions may be played upon by sensuous stimuli."7 But
especially in the domain of sex unwarranted power has been
delegated to the physical senses. Their alertness to sex-stim
ulating impressions has been encouraged and overdeveloped
by ages of licentiousness. As a result of the habitual sharp
ening of the senses in this respect, the sexual system has be
come artificially and unduly responsive to tactile and olfac
tory, to auditory and visual impressions, and thus "sexual
excitement is furnished . . . from all [sense-] organs of the
body."8
Fundamentally it is not the senses that are to be blamed
for the unnatural excitability of the libido. The fault lies
with the way in which the senses have been used, and with
the mental and emotional response to sentient impressions.
Each of the physical senses should be trained and developed
to the utmost in its own particular field for the purpose of

expanding one's awareness through conscious observation.
But when the activities of one of the senses are used as a
reminder and as a stimulant of other sensations, and when
they are turned into means of sensual gratification — then
there is abuse of natural faculties ; then the senses are de
veloped to the exclusion and at the cost of higher faculties ;
then evolution cannot proceed.
Always to discriminate clearly between a natural and an
unnatural use of the physical senses is a rather difficult pro
blem because the world of the senses as well as "the world
of the body is delusive except to him who has escaped from
carnal lusts."9 Until this has been attained "men's percep
tions are warped by their passions."10 At least some degree
of clear spiritual perception is essential to right discrimina
tion. But "human passion and [misapplied] physical senses
are ever in the way of the development of spiritual percep
tions."11 "The eye of the man of sensuous perception is closed
firmly to all that is transcendental."11
Until a glimpse has been caught of either a subjective or
an objective transcendental world it may remain difficult to
believe that anything exists except what is observable
through the physical senses.
Yet it is well enough known that the possibilities of ob
servation through the physical senses are limited. Whether
or not assisted by mechanical appliances, these senses make
possible an awareness of various wide fields of the external
world — fields differing from each other in their ranges of
vibrations. But the sum total of all those fields that one can
at best become aware of through all the senses together is
far from covering the entire outside world. It is scientifically
acknowledged that between and beyond the ranges of vi
brations knowable by the senses there are wider ranges to
which the physical sense organs can not be made to respond.
There is however no logical reason to reject the idea that
man, without leaving the physical body, can develop other
powers than those of the physical senses for the perception
of what these senses cannot perceive. But only few have been
able to affirm from experience that there is "a spiritual
power of seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling and tasting — a

conception and of which even the learned usually do not
know the existence."13 Few know by fully conscious expe
rience that "there are loftier beauties which in the sense-
bound life we are not granted to know . . . To the vision of
these we must mount, leaving sense to its own lower place."14
But only "whoever gets out of subjection to the senses
. . . can be a person of spiritual vision."15 And "this may
be brought about . . . through oblivion of the passions."
Therefore "the wise ones tarry not in pleasure-grounds of
senses."17 Indeed, "never was there a wise man who had not
to reject pleasures of the senses to acquire his wisdom."1'
For only "if the senses are restrained the intelligence in

"To be immune to the attractions of the senses is to invite
into expression the spiritual powers"10 ; and "the more the
spirit increases in power the more it is detached from sen
sible objects."" Then it finds that "beyond all the [physi
cal] sensations there is a bliss compared to which the plea
sures of the senses are [like those of children's] playthings.""
Then it knows "the boundless joy that lies beyond the sen-

becomes clear that "true happiness never comes to us
through the avenue of the senses"14, and that even for the
sake of simple happiness "the sense nature of man must be
subordinated to the aims of the spirit."15 "Man must lead
a life above sense . . . rising till he touches the infinite re

INSPIRATION
"Moral imperfection! lenen the de
gree of inspiration."
— Maimomidbs, Eight Chapters on
vii,8 1.
Although it may not seem a demonstrable fact, "the
limit of inspiration is the limit of receptivity . . . produced
by the discipline of the lower nature."1 The more this is
under control, the higher one's aspirations may become. And
inspiration is but a negative reception of impressions in re
sponse to aspiration. Inspiration is not under the positive
control of the will. It comes in flashes, be it through the
mind or through one of the senses. It can only find its way
where mind or sense is hypersensitive.
Art being dependent more on the senses than on the
mind, a high degree of sensitiveness of one or more of the
senses is indispensable to an artist if he is to receive inspira
tion. In the course of harmonious evolution such a sensitive
ness is acquired along with a proportionate development of
all the other elements that constitute evolutionary progress.
But in the artist the sense-sensitiveness frequently is a man
ifestation of one-sided growth — such as the athlete, the
scientist, the mystic, the philosopher and the yogi often
demonstrate along other single tracks of evolvement.
With the sensitized senses as a means of contact with
the beauty side of nature, the artistic temperament may
sometimes open to inspirational perception of supernal
beauty. "What is thus caused by nature may be imitated
by art'", and the thrilled recipient tries to render it in lines
or words, in physical sound or shape or color. "The busi
ness of every form of art is but to mimic a corresponding
form of nature."3 "The earthly artist . . . tries to give us a
hint of his glimpse of truth. Only those who have tried know
how small a fraction of his vision he can under the most
favorable circumstances contrive to represent.'"

56 The Coiled Serpent
It is in the interim between flashes of inspiration that
artists crave new sense-impressions in a longing for new in
spiration. Too often, mistaking sensuous excitement for in
spirational sensation, they seek an outlet for their craving
in sensual gratification, which many of them virtually claim
to be an essential aid to the expression of their artistic power.
But if this power were increased by sexual activity, there
certainly would be more genii.
The very nature of inspiration is such that it can only
come down from a high source, to which the aspiring one
must reach up. Inspiration constitutes the highest purpose
for which the senses can be used. Evidently then, true in
spiration can never be found on the low level of sense-grati
fication. What sometimes is found on this level and is then
mistaken for inspiration, is an emotional impetus similar to
that which is occasionally instilled by alcohol or drugs.
Not on account of such stimulation but notwithstanding
its degrading quality, the resulting animation of the faculties
may find expression in the production of things contain
ing an element of beauty, if their maker happens to possess
the necessary technique. But in such a case technique is often
used to disguise in a beautiful form an expression of lower
emotions, which subtly spread their pernicious influence over
those who are attracted by the admirable appearance of the
form.
Technique without inspiration can never produce true
art. Art can be real only when it is inspired by the Muses,
whose task must ever be to uplift mankind by making it
sensitive and receptive to the sublimity of supraphysical,
divine beauty. Inspiration can manifest only in response to
wholehearted aspiration — and in aspiration all material
wants are forgotten. Sense-gratification is the irreconcilable
opponent of aspiration. "Aspiration ... is stifled by the
net of unspiritual desires."5 Wherever there is but a trace
of bodily gratification there can be no question of aspiration
— hence no question of inspiration, nor of true art either.
Occasionally great works of art have been inspired by
pure spiritual love, when this was devoid of sensual attrac
tion. Such were the outstanding historical cases which are

so often erroneously quoted as instances of and as excuses
for erotic romanticism in artists. Only pure love, free from
eroticism, contains an uplifting power that can carry one
toward the realm of heavenly beauty. Hence, vaguely and
crudely though it be, youth is so often inclined to be poetic
and artistic in its period of just awakening, unsoiled, ideal
istic love, when the fast waxing life force is by no thought or
act diverted to the lower centers. But whenever in young
or old the life force is involved in sexual expression, the
channel for inspiration becomes clogged.
The futile searching for inspiration in the wrong direc
tion is the greatest blunder of artistic temperaments. Even
though it may not always seem to interfere immediately with
their artistic expression, this error is undoubtedly the fore
most cause of the fits of melancholy, the moodiness and lack
of balance of which so many artists suffer. And these dis
turbances within cannot fail to exert a deleterious influence
on their art, which as a result in many cases shows a deca
dence after a short period of auspicious productivity.
If artists could always aspire to inspiration in a truly
supersensuous way, free from the lower attractions of the
senses, it could be theirs almost continuously. But "as long
as we enjoy our senses . . . and do not know how to free
ourselves from their thraldom, so long will it be impossible
... to break through the barrier which separates us from
a knowledge of things in themselves.'" And without that
knowledge even a genius remains dependent upon unfre-
quent and deceptive flashes of inspiration, which are pos
sible only when he rises above his lower nature.
To be sure, "art in its highest manifestation is a path to
cosmic consciousness."7 But such can never be the art of the
sense-bound, nor of the would-be artists who fill the world
with erotic literature, erratic statuary, exotic paintings and
exciting jazz.
True art can only be produced by one who keeps the
channel for inspiration free from sensual obstructions — be
it only in preparation for and during the execution of a spe
cial work. There are great "artists who feel most fit for work
when refraining entirely from sexual intercourse."8 Many a

INTELLECT AND INTUITION
"There is something inherently an
tagonistic between sex and intellect."
— Inoram, The Modern Attitude,
iii,41.
Mind is meant to help in the liberation of mankind from
enthralment to matter. But it cannot be of any help while
so little of
it,
while on an average only
a
tenth of its full ca
pacity
is
being used. Nor so long as the mind's instrument,
the brain, and with
it
the rest of the body are unprepared
and insufficiently purified to utilize even that little portion
of the mind properly. The mind cannot fulfill its liberating
mission so long as people continue to make use of what little
they have available of
it
in the diffused and untoward way
in which most of them apply it.
Like any other force mind can be used in multitudinous
ways. When applied exclusively to material interests, only
concrete lower mind can become manifest
;
this is
a
part of
the mind which has become blinded by the density of mat
ter, and intellect
is
its highest mode of expression. When ap
plied to spiritual concerns another part of the mind, ab
stract Mind begins to manifest and to open the way to intui
tion. In other words, one might say that materialistic-intel
lectual man uses the mind, while intuitive-spiritual man uses
Mind.
Intuition, by the way, springs from the same source as
instinct
;
both are expressions of nature's intelligence. In the
form of physical instinct this unfailing intelligence
is
un
consciously and only partially partaken of by the mindless
animal. But man, having mind, must by positive effort make
himself ready to share consciously in the entire cosmic in
telligence and to become nature's full-grown, willing co
worker. Through tuition — through allround exercise of his
mind, and by gradually developing Mind — he must learn
how to acquire intuition, which might be called spiritual in

stinct. In this way he can reestablish the close harmonious
link with nature's intelligence, which he lost when animal
instinct was replaced by an as yet imperfectly developed
mentality.1
When the mind first became manifest in man it was
drawn into the vortex of carnal life. The mind's elements
of self -consciousness, memory and anticipation were applied
to the main interests of primitive animal-man, to his body-
impulses. Man used his mind to excite these impulses con
stantly beyond their natural usefulness. Having continued
this stimulation of the passions through the ages, the greater
part of the race still clings to the habit of using the mind in
ordinately in that detrimental way.
Thus in the course of time "consciousness and memory
have greatly strengthened the hold of sex on mankind . . .
and increased the tendency to give it an unduly prominent
sway over conduct. The result is that humanity is over
sexed"1, and that the abuse of sex has grown excessive. To
change this abnormality it is necessary first of all that "by
purification . . . man shall make his mind harmonious with
Mind."3 Most effectively "the mind is purged by absti
nence"14 ; "by subduing passion the mind becomes clear.'"
And "in the degree in which a man's mind is nearer to free
dom from all passion, in that degree also is it nearer to
strength.""
Contrariwise "those who yield themselves to lower de
sires drive Mind away, and their appetites are only the more
strengthened by the mind."7 Unfortunately nearly every one
clings desperately to the lower mind, seeking to over-capital
ize on his intellect. But it is the higher, ever capitalized Mind
that will eventually lead through intuition to nature's most
secret chambers where "she shows her treasures only to the
eye of spirit . . . the eye for which there is no veil in all her
kingdoms.'"
Under exceptionally favorable conditions "intellectual
reasoning . . . may arrive at the door of the spiritual tem
ple.'" Occasionally some mental genius has climbed the steps
that lead up to the sanctuary's portals. If he worked in un

which to help the progress of the race, the spiritual element
in this kind of intellectual occupation may have brought
him on the very threshold of nature's storehouse of unlimited
true knowledge. But in order to be able to cross this thresh
old one must first realize that "he who wants to enter into
the sanctuary must die to . . . his animal impulses and de
sires."10 "If the intellect is in the bonds of the flesh ... it
will be unable to penetrate into the divine mysteries of na
ture.""
Even without looking for spiritual attainments the nor
mal growth of intellect itself depends upon a strict limitation
of sexual expression. For in individual development as well
as in the evolution of the race intellectual power is a mani
festation of the life force. Whatever amount of this force is
trifled away in sex, is lost to the possibility of being trans
formed into intellectual energy.1'
Of old it has been known that "carnal pleasure ... is
at war with intellect."18 And the latest scientific pronounce
ment still confirms that "in order to reach its full power in
tellect seems to require . . . repression of the sexual appe
tite."14 Therefore, "to the attainment of a life according to
intellect it is requisite to abstain from ... all venereal
concerns."15
That at least "a measure of sexual continence is the
pre-condition ... of mental energy"16 is beyond a doubt.
For "all who have to do intense mental work feel . . . how
continence increases their alertness and efficiency."" Espe
cially if their continence is self-willed and freely chosen. For
this reason "many eminent thinkers seem to have been with
out sexual desire."18 They overcame
it,
realizing that "the
continent life gives . .
.
the greatest intellectual strength."1'
This
is
not to say that everybody who refrains from sex
ual acts can thereby become highly intellectual. Not every
body
is
born with the potential capacity out of which intel
lectual genius can be developed. Moreover, many who do
not waste part of their life force in sexual activity fritter
it
away in petty personal concerns and in endless small talk.
Decidedly, in the life of every individual "a certain as

tualism"20 — that is to say : to the maximum of intellectual
ity that can possibly be attained in each individual case.
Therefore, "if the human race is to progress in an intellec
tual direction it must become . . . less sexual in its procli
vities."21
To reach up to intuition one has to rise not only above
the attractions of the senses, but above the limitations of
the concrete mind. Thus alone can one acquire "the faculty
. . . through which direct and certain knowledge is attain
able."" The manifestation of that faculty "varies with the
nature of the vehicle ; through the more finely differentiated

But the fabric can be sufficiently refined only by those who

UNFOLDING OF SPIRIT
"So far ai man becomes spiritual, so
far he puts off the love of sex."
— Swedenboro, Conjugal Love, 48,11.
The oldest records and legendary traditions of many na
tions prove that spiritual teachings have been given to the
human race since times immemorial. They indicate that
"true progress in the individual and in society consists in a
growing spiritualization and in the ever more complete mas
tery of spirit over matter."1 But few have paid any attention,
and fewer have been willing to apply the rules for spiritual
development contained in such teachings. The great major
ity has always refused to heed the requirements for spiritual
unfoldment — with the result that the very meaning of
spirituality remains little understood. Some materialists even
deny that it can have any meaning, because they have never
been able to see or sense or in any way experience it.
"A way must be found ... of establishing as a fact that
there exists in man a spiritual nature which exalts him."*
But just as a Bushman cannot grasp intellectuality as a con
cept because he cannot know it through the senses, so most
of modern, civilized "mankind seems stricken with spiritual
blindness and deafness"3, because spirituality is "not only
beyond the power of sensual perception but . . . beyond
that of intellectual comprehension."4 Yet, in the words of
some of the most advanced thinkers, including some of our
own day, "the spiritual life belongs to the permanent reality
of the world."5 Not only that, but "it is the central point of
reality."8 "The nature of all reality is spiritual."7 Every
where "the ultimate reality in things is spiritual."8
Thus also "man as he really is ... is a spiritual being'",
hidden though the spiritual side of his nature may be. And
whether he realizes it or not, "man is essentially governed
by spirit. Consequently he must give prominence to its
claims"10 — especially if he wants to evolve beyond the sor

didness and the shallowness of the average present form of
existence. "The endeavor to advance in spirituality is the
soul of the life of the individual ; where there is no endeavor
of this kind there is no true life."11 "If the spiritual side of a
man's nature be undeveloped he is not truly fullgrown."1'
From an evolutionary viewpoint "the goal of attainment
... is spirit in its completeness."15 For every human entity
"the attainment of spiritual individuality constitutes a lofty
goal, only to be compassed by . . . self-reformation and
self-discipline."14 But "the animal nature . . . impedes it
from steadily progressing on the path of its evolution.""
In the end spirit's rule must become supreme. In the
earliest stages of expression of life in form physical bodies
had to be built. In the body sense-awareness and emotions
were then developed, and they governed the actions of the
body. At a further stage intellect became manifest, and it
now influences the emotions — unwisely yet, because intel
lect itself is still imperfect and unwise. Quite logically and
naturally this stage must be followed by the unfolding of
spirituality, which eventually will rule wisely over all physi
cal and emotional and mental activities. "It is only when the
spiritual rules and directs that there can be permanent har
mony."18 And "the highest efficiency can be attained only
when the sex nature is . . . kept under the control of the
spiritual faculties.""
In each of us the four factors — body, emotion, mind
and spirit — coexist, although they are not equally active.
So far we have been largely limited to the lower aspects of
the first three. United into one these three — dense physical
body, sensuous emotions and concrete mind — make up the
personality with all its grasping, greedy tendencies, its self-
interest and its personal, material wants. "We have become
foolishly convinced that the highest perfection of man is the
development of the wants of the personality . . . and that
happiness consists in gratifying those wants."18 But the most
superficial analytic observation of modern civilization should
prove to any one the utter fallacy of this idea ; the present
generation's nerve-wrecking search for happiness proves to

be unsuccessful because it is directed toward personal grati
fication instead of toward spiritual attainment.
The widespread lack of happiness lies mainly in the neg
lect of the spiritual principle. Not only is there neglect but
resentment and resistance. The personality opposes the ad
vent of the impersonality of spirit, because it feels that under
the sway of spirit its own selfish ways will be endangered.
But before spirituality can even begin to manifest, the resis
tance of the personality must change into willing, longing
aspiration. "For the spiritualization of human life a longing
rooted in the whole being is primarily necessary."1'
Suitable conditions for spiritual life must be prepared.
Spirit cannot find expression so long as "the lower passions
chain the higher aspirations to the rock of matter."10 Only
"as the soul is purified from all sensual affections . . . does
it attain to liberty of spirit."" Naturally "the spiritual man
must be stronger than his impulses"", for "true spirituality
can be attained only when a pure life is led."23 "Before one
can attract the spiritual qualities . . . one must repulse the
sexual tendencies."1*
"Can man rise to this spiritual level? On the possibility
of his doing so rests all our hope of supplying any meaning
and value to life."15 Not until the spiritual element finds
expression in human nature is there a chance for the realiza
tion of an ideally harmonious and peaceful life on earth.**

MARRIAGE
"In the further ascent of man carnal
marriage becomes ... a corrupt relic
of immature conditions in the race."
— Harris, The Wedding Guest,20.
It has long been thought that a permanent sexual part
nership existed in many of the higher animal species. Later,
more extensive and closer study seems to have shown that its
occurrence is a great exception.1 But this scarcity of instances
in the animal world does not disprove that monogamy is and
remains an evolutionary institution belonging to the human
stage.
Man, having evolved beyond the animal, cannot take its
ways of living as an exact model for his own. He has to raise
the instinctive tendencies of the lower kingdom to a higher
standard. To do this successfully he has to follow the funda
mental lines of development which nature has laid down. In
regard to mating the general trend has been that with a
lengthening of the period of gestation and of helplessness of
the progeny "there must be a union of male and female for
the bringing up of the young . . . and this union must be
of considerable duration."* It is through this extended and
devoted cooperation that "sexual reproduction leads to
. . . the dawn of the love of mates and the evolution of
parental emotions."8 For love develops in interdependence
better than in independence.
It is not the sexual communion that gives rise to affection
and love, but the close cooperation and the community of in
terests. And this sharing of interests is to be raised from the
material level to the mental and then to the spiritual —
until it loses all connection with sex.
If nature has not on every side given the example of
monogamy, yet the evolutionary development toward this
relationship has been clearly indicated. If nature in its low
er kingdom has not supplied many a perfected model of a

permanent marriage relation, she has at least laid a solid
foundation for it. On this natural basis humanity could have
erected a beautiful structure of towering strength, designed
with mounting lines of highest aspiration, constructed
throughout of stone of flawless purity. But instead of adding
to nature's work man has discarded the natural foundation,
and on more accessible but much lower ground has built a
flimsy structure for sexual convenience.
"Marriage as it is today is a corrupt institution.'" Com
pared with its ideal form "the actual marriage, in its squalid
perversity ... is as the wretched idol of the savage to the
reality which it is supposed to represent"5 ; it is only "man's
little clay image of the heavenly love . . . cracked in the
fire of daily life.'" "Physical sense . . . places it on a false
basis.'"
The perfect marriage utilizes sex in physical expression
only for reproduction and serves in its secondary, psycholo
gical effects as "a means of arousing the higher emotions of
_ reverence . . . and compassion and self-sacrifice"8, leading
to a spiritualization of affection. But the human imitation
uses sex for sensual satisfaction. As long as marriage con
tains a trace of this sensual element it forms an impervious
obstacle to spiritual expansion.
Even though legalized by the state, sanctified by the
church, and acclaimed by popular standards, the licensed
licentiousness of carnal marriage remains antagonistic to
nature's purposes and to man's higher development.
The mere going through a religious rite or a legal for
mality cannot possibly change nature's physiological and
spiritual laws. Quite in harmony with the highest concepts
of moral philosophy "science refuses to admit that the cere
mony of marriage nullifies or changes natural principles.'"
Scientifically considered "there is no difference whatever
between the married and the unmarried so far as the physi
cal sex act and its consequences are concerned."10
Of course, even practical sociological considerations raise
human reproduction in wedlock ethically and psychologi
cally above that in unmarried relationship. But from what
ever standpoint non-productive sexual intercourse in mar

riage may be sanctioned or condoned, it constitutes as much
an infraction of natural law as out of wedlock. "The sanc
tion that has been invented is merely an ingenious defense
of a desire."11 From nature's standpoint "the same act can
not become good or bad according as it is performed in or
out of marriage.""
"It is a strange delusion that marriage can make allow
able and moral that which out of marriage is immoral."11
It is illogical and insincere and hypocritical to proclaim that
what is unnecessary, condemnable and immoral before mar
riage should become moral, condonable and even necessary
after the marriage ceremony. "There is no worse prejudice
than to believe that sensuality can be justified by the lawful
bonds of marriage."14
"If illicit intercourse is unnecessary to health15, then licit
intercourse is equally superfluous. There cannot be the
slightest difference between the two kinds as far as necessity
to health is concerned."18 Social or legal or religious con
tracts cannot affect the fact that "sexual indulgence is not
necessary to health."1' And always, under all circumstances,■
"every purposeless or merely sensual communion is a waste
of vital energy."18 Physiologically as well as morally "lust is-
an abomination . . . whether it be in the state of wedlock
or out of it."13
In regard to sex "marriage in its existing form is as in
compatible as free love with the highest interpretations of
the moral law"10 as well as of the physiological.
The logical conclusion from the preceding remarks is
not that marriage should be abolished, but that it should be
elevated. Far from having outgrown the necessity of mar
riage, materialistic humanity has not even begun to under
stand what real marriage means.
As long as the sexual method of reproduction lasts, a
permanent partnership of one man with one woman is not
to be substituted or supplemented by less durable, more ex
citing sexual attachments, but to be purified and evolved
into a loftier union. Even if one holds that "marriage is es
sentially the adjustment of the sexual tensions prevailing
between the sexes"11, the fact remains that "the adjustment

sex attraction."*3
Continence in marriage is undoubtedly more difficult
than in the unmarried state. "Within the married relation
. . . the sex desire is enormously stimulated because the
opportunity for its satisfaction is unhindered."*4 Moreover,
the almost general approval given by a sense-bound,
thoughtless world to unreproductive intercourse in mar
riage tends to break down whatever scruples one or both of
the wedded partners may have against it.
It may require rare power of will, combined with high-
mindedness and strong convictions to resist entirely the de
sire for sexual gratification in the physical closeness of wed
lock. Yet, "strict continence in married life is not without
illustrations of those who have voluntarily chosen it."25
"There are couples who . . . give up sexual relations ab
solutely, and are not any less happy, but often more happy
on that account."*"
'Tn the ideal marriage the partners will unite in sexual
congress only in a longing for parenthood, conscious of the
- sacrificial nature of their act. No one can doubt that the
bringing forth of a child is a sacrifice on the woman's part.
That in its highest aspect the fructifying act is a sacrifice
on the part of the male will gain recognition when the
value of the secretions of the sex glands27 and the currents
of the life force in the body*8 are better understood. Far
from having to fear impairment of body or of nerves, "those
who seek the ideal . . . may live a life of marital conti
nence not only without injury but with positive benefit."**
Moreover, "abstinence . . . will but serve to strengthen
mutual affection"30, whereas in most carnal marriages the
affection gradually diminishes. "The feeling of attachment
. . . becomes stronger and more constant when the conju
gal relation is maintained habitually pure."81 "In the recog
nition of this fact is to be found the secret of married happi
ness between wedded advanced and cultured individuals."8*

SOUL-MATES
"All souls . . . not only pairs of souls
are one."
— Das, Scienee of Social Organiza
tion 4v,2 19.
The soul-mate theory propounds that somewhere in the
universe each human soul has its supplementary counter
part with which it was originally at one and with which it
must seek to be reunited. And this is usually interpreted as
a reunion in the flesh.
This theory is based apparently upon the hypothesis
found in various ancient teachings that at one time there
were no separate male and female bodies, but that each body
was complete in itself, self-reproductive, containing equally
active male and female elements such as many plants still
do possess. The theory suggests that nature, in creating sep
arate sexes, suddenly split the hermaphroditic body into
halves, at the same time splitting the indwelling soul into
two separate units.
Nature however is more likely to have worked slowly, to
have changed the physical form gradually through endlessly
succeeding generations, without in any way affecting the
soul. In one series of changes the female elements of the
bodies were made paramount, leaving inactive rudiments
of the male ; in the other just the opposite procedure must
have taken place. Proof of this evolutionary process can be
seen in the vestigial organs in the bodies of each sex. Mean
time in every individual case the indwelling soul remained
just what it was : a complete being as before, now tempo
rarily using a single-sexed instead of a double-sexed body.
This natural process does not present the slightest logical
basis for the soul-mate idea.
Another source from which the soul-mate theory may
have sprung is the little understood metaphysical concept

known as the 'mystic marriage'. Christian mystics have
symbolically described this as the marriage to Christ (su
preme love) . Philosophical mystics have spoken of it as their
marriage to Sophia (supreme wisdom) . Mohammedan mys
tics have written about it in the most glowing words as the
union with the Beloved (the spirit). In every case the lan
guage used in carrying out the simile has frequently been
of such a nature as to mislead the reader who has no under
standing of mystic lore, and to leave the impression that in
deed a personal and sexual union with another soul was
meant.
But the 'mystic marriage' does not refer to any personal
union, not even of soul with soul. It personifies the imper
sonal and immaculate union of soul with spirit, with what
may be called the divine counterpart of the soul. It depicts
the reunion of the soul with that from which it came and
of which it is only an individualized part. The 'mystic mar
riage' symbolizes the union of the soul with one's higher
self, with the divine essence that dwells in each. As a result
of this spiritual, inward union the perfect man with perfect
love and with perfect wisdom is born. It is the union that
every human being shall have to seek and bring about as
evolution proceeds. But this union with spirit cannot take
place so long as there remains a tendency toward sexual
gratification.
Sex has to be transcended before soul can know spirit.
From whatever source it may have been taken, the soul-
mate theory confuses the idea of soul attraction with that of
sex attraction, for it looks on the plane of the soul for a sex
ual mate. But the soul itself is sexless.1 All "souls are of the
selfsame nature . . . nor male, nor female are they."* Souls
do not propagate ; therefore they need no reproductive fac
ulty, no sex.
No wonder then that as a rule "they are miserably de
ceived who look for a mate from on high.'" If they were
willing to purify their sexual relation they might find lasting
soul companionship, which can be only sexless. But if the
self-styled soul-mates dwell on the sexual level they soon
find naught but soulless sex communion.

Soul-Mates 75
The theory of soul-mates has not been demonstrated as
workable in practice. Is there a single instance in which
those who joined because they thought themselves to be
soul-mates, have proven to be inseverably reunited halves
of one unit? Their tie rarely survives the stage of sexual
satiety, which never fails to come unless sex is surmounted.
At best so-called soul-mates are no better or no worse than
any other mates. But too often soul-mateship is only an ex
cuse for those who want to change from one mate to anoth
er.
However, apart from doubtful soul-mate theories a
strong attraction may exist between soul and soul, between
souls similarly attuned and equally high-evolved. No greater
boon can come to any soul than to be closely linked with
another kindred one. But this "can only take place when
purity has been established to such an extent that the soul
no longer yearns for the seductive pleasures of the senses."4
In a tie of soul with soul sex plays no part.
Sex attraction must be overcome before soul can know
soul.

LOVE VERSUS SEX
"Sexuality and love are opposed prin
ciples."
— Lucka, £>oj,II,ii,209.
"Concupiscence has nothing in common with love."1
Popular opinion in its confusing way may declare them to
be identical or inseparable, but they remain in essence mu
tually inimical.
""Love is spiritual and increases the dominion of spirit;
sex is physical and emphasizes the power of matter at the
cost of spirit. Love belongs to the soul, sex to the body. Lovs
is eternal, sex is ephemeral. Love is selfless, sex is selfish ;
"there is no selfishness so deep as the selfishness of sex in
dulgence."' Love works for the interests of the other, sex for
its own. Love radiates, sex vampirizes. Love in abundance
refines and elevates, sex in abundance coarsens and de
grades. Love by itself gives restful bliss ; sex by itself gives
restless cravings. Love speeds evolution, sex retards it.
Basically "earthly sex is opposed to spiritual love"3, and
"love ... is antagonistic to those elements which press to
wards sexual union."4 In its true nature "love can be known
only when sex consciousness is absent."5
Love is the unifying principle in the universe. Where
love exists there is a longing for unification, for proximity,
for sharing every expression of fife on every plane of man
ifestation. Hence love between the sexes usually includes a
longing to share parenthood and, as a means thereto, to
share that most intimate relationship that can lead to par
enthood. This relationship then comes about indirectly as a
by-product, not as a direct expression of love. Still, when
this longing to share parenthood is either consciously or
subconsciously present, sex communion might almost be
called a love act. For in such a case the love element over
whelmingly exceeds the sex element, which is there only to
serve its natural purpose. But even then, as a rule, sex dis

illusions love, so that for many a couple "with the rending
of the bridal veil the illusion is destroyed."* They soon dis
cover that sex fulfillment is not love fulfillment.
Whenever the act is dissociated from its propagative
purpose it is entirely dissociated from love. Then it becomes
an expression of merely physical attraction and gratification.
Although momentarily uniting the bodies, it does not unify
the souls — which is the unification that love looks for. Jus
tification for the sexual act of two who love each other is
often sought in calling it a reflection of the real oneness7 ;
but it remains as impossible to attain that oneness through
its so-called reflection as it is to catch a bird by reaching
out for its reflection in a pond.
Evidently "an attraction that springs merely from sex
ual impulse cannot be love at all."8 Sex, seeking its own
physical gratification, has not the slightest connection with
love. Unreproductive sexual action is neither based on love,
nor does it inspire love. Instead of leading to love "the ani
mal attraction of one body for another . . . ends in satiety
and disgust"9 — proof of which can be seen in numberless
divorces, in short-lived so-called love affairs, and in the dis
cordant relation of many married couples. Only rarely is
true love strong enough to survive the demands of sex un
scathed. Sooner than to promote love "lust . . . readily
passes into hate."10 Therefore "love's arch foe is lust."11
Sex desire, in order to make itself more acceptable, may
disguise itself as love, and call itself sex-love. But the dis
guise cannot change its nature. Under all circumstances it
remains true that "the indulgence of the sexual appetite can
by no means be regarded as an expression of love."18 It is
only an expression of desire.13 And "love and desire are two
unlike, mutually exclusive, opposing conditions."14 "Love is
higher than sexual desire"15, and does not require sexual
intimacy. "The fullest fruition of love is without the loss of
virginity."18
Only a slender thread connects sex and love. It consists
of nature's secondary use of sexual reproduction as a means
of laying the foundation for love.17 The whole strength of
that thread lies in its element of reproduction, in joining two

for the sake of the young. But as soon as the reproductive
element is eliminated, the thread snaps. Then love and sex
fall apart into their natural antagonism in which sex kills
love. In uncountable cases "love has been slain upon the
sexual altar."18
Tassion is the distortion of love."1' "When one loves
one rises above . . . passion."" Just "because of his love the
courtly lover is pure."*1 Those who truly love, will know
that "sexual expression is . . . not so satisfying as spiritual
affinity."" The greater and purer their love, the less there
remains of sex. Out of love and for the sake of love they re
nounce passion and sex. Thus "love slays the liking of
lechery . . . and brings into the soul true chastity."*
"Chastity is a wealth that comes from abundance of love."*1
In the course of evolution love must conquer sex. "The
serpent . . . would devour the world, were it not van
quished by love"*5, by that pure love which does not feed
but defeats sex.
When love comes into its own it will automatically su
persede sex. But "the rehabilitation of love depends upon
the recovery of man's spiritual significance."" Not until
man removes the greatest obstacle to his spiritual unfold-
ment — not until he frees himself from the overbearing
power of sex — can love come into expression.

XXII
BIRTH CONTROL
"Sexual relations unfavorable to the
rearing of offspring . . . must tend
towards degradation."
— Spencer, Principles of Ethics ,11,
xiii,i8i.
Repulsive to all of us is the custom of those ancient Pom-
peians who used emetics at their dinner parties. After eating
all that the stomach would hold they promptly emptied it in
their 'vomitorium' in order to be able to eat again. They
did not eat for the natural purpose of preserving the body,
but for the satisfaction of their unnatural appetite. They
ate exclusively for the pleasurable sensation of tasting and
swallowing food, for sense-gratification. And they must have
judged themselves extremely clever for having discovered
how to circumvent the purpose for which nature has de
signed the digestive system. But today everybody looks back
in disgust at that unwholesome and vulgar practice of the
past.
Yet, far more loathsome is the now widespread practice
-
of contraception. By humiliating preparations which reduce
the body to a mere instrument for sensual expression, or by
other unethical methods, contraceptors seek to circumvent
the purpose for which nature has designed the reproductive
system. "These nature thwarters"1 want cohabitation, not
for the natural purpose of race perpetuation but for the sat
isfaction of their unnatural sex appetite, for sensual gratifi
cation.
So cunning and specious are the modern arguments
which are advanced in support of contraception, and so
strongly do they appeal to an already oversensualized gen
eration, that birth control has become a readily accepted
custom of the day. But undoubtedly "a more sensitized
. . . world of the future will view contraceptives with the
distaste now felt for the ancient resort of emetics."1

Birth Control 81
Because humanity is what it
is,
birth control has found
countless propagandists and adherents. But just because hu
manity
is
no better than
it
is,
its present standards cannot
be accepted as the best and noblest. Just as
a
cry of all the
world for war does not make war an ideal world condition
— and just as
a
craving for narcotics in
a
growing number
of people does not make their use an advisable habit for
any one — so does the popularity of contraceptives not jus •
tify their use. All that
it
proves
is
that there are many people
who gladly welcome any means to evade
a
natural conse
quence of sexual indulgence.
Whatever sociological and other purely materialistic
contentions may be put forth to defend contraception, all
its methods are and remain
a
sordid perversion of nature's
designs and purposes. All methods that intentionally and
artificially prevent the possibility of fructification are in
herently unnatural and abnormal. "All methods of produc
ing the orgasm by contact of the sexes save the normal
one are unphysiologic, and therefore injurious."3 "At the
best they are tampering with nature, and that
is
a
danger
ous thing in itself."4 "Nature cannot be abused with im
punity." She has her own unfailing way of upholding her
precepts and "she
is
prompt to punish any infringement of
her laws by those who are legally married as well as those
who illicitly break them.'" "Though she often seems to be
satisfied with deferred payment, she exacts
it
finally in one
coin or another."7 "Never can any advantage be taken of
nature by
a
trick."8
Under all circumstances "when no children are desired
the exercise of the sexual function ...
is
a
detriment.'"
When any kind of preventives of conception are used "their
uncertainty, their desperate matter-of-factness . . . and the
probability that they are in one way or another dangerous
or harmful
:
all these things are against them."10
"There
is
no harmless way in which to prevent concep
tion"11, at least not by artificial means. There
is
"but one
prescription which
is
both safe and sure, namely: that the
sexes shall remain apart."11 "The best means to prevent con
ception
is
total sexual abstinence, and
it
is
perfectly harm
less."1* "Every mode of prevention, other than that of living

in chastity, is an evident violation of nature."14 "The ideal
ist .. . insists that the proper method of birth control is
self-control, and he condemns the use of contraceptives."15
"Contraceptive practices . . . are objected to by some
authorities on the ground that they are liable to induce
nervous or mental instability."18 "Eminent neurologists and
psychiatrists talk in terms of neuroses and psychoses as the
result of the refusal of parenthood"17 by those who yet prac
tise sexual congress.
When parenthood is wished for after using contracep
tives for some time, there is often disappointment. This is
because in the woman the use of contraceptives may have
destroyed the capacity for motherhood; for "it seems pro
bable that sperm-overloading is a cause of sterility." In
fact, "world-renowned authorities have posited sterility as
an almost certain consequence of contraception."1'
"The gravest objection to the use of even the [seem
ingly] safest contraceptives ... is that they are psycholo
gically unnatural."20 "All the means that have been resorted
to in order to prevent conception . . . disturb the finer
sensibilities of man and woman"11 — especially of the wo
man, "since here, as so often in matters of sex, the man's
satisfaction is largely at the cost of the woman.""
"The supreme objection to all methods of contraception
is in the spiritual field."2' "No one can practise any form
of birth control . . . without being injured spiritually."14
The very thought leading to the decision to reduce sexual
congress to an act of unproductive self-gratification tends
to paralyze every nascent spiritual faculty. Even if contra
ceptives were made absolutely reliable and not in the least
injurious, their application would still remain not only an
anti-natural but also — by its prevention of spiritual growth
— an anti-evolutionary, hence in final effect an anti-social
procedure.

XXIII
EUGENICS
"To bring about a higher type of hu
manity . . . the individual must re
press his strong animal impulses."
— Gruber, Die Prostitution^-
Unquestionably "the procreation of children should be a
matter far more carefully regulated by moral considerations
than it is at present"1 ; for under conditions as they are the
welfare of unborn populations of the earth is continually
being sacrificed to the sensualism of their progenitors. In
order to remove the greatest obstacle to the improvement of
the race "man must assume a more complete restraint over
his reproductive functions and subordinate his inclinations
to the future interests of his descendants."1
Even where love links the parents "it rarely happens that
in sexual relations much unselfish thought is bestowed upon
unborn individuals."3 Yet "a conscientious man and woman
would not enter upon procreation without the most serious
considerations as to the probable value of their progeny."4
To make the productive act ideally effective they will raise
it to a deed of love for the unborn, and gladly sacrifice their
personal gratifications to the welfare of the child.
Love between the parents is of course a factor of inesti
mable value to the progeny on account of the harmony
which will influence conception, gestation and childhood.
But eugenically considered, mutual love of the parents is not
the greatest, not even an indispensable factor for the well-
being of the babe. After all, "procreation is carried on quite
successfully by means of the ordinary organic functions,
without any lofty ecstasy of personal love"5 ; and even arti
ficial insemination — which entirely excludes the element of
love of the parents for each other — has been demonstrated
to be of practical eugenic value."
The one imperative eugenic requirement is parental ded
ication to the child-to-be, even long before it is conceived.

Eugenics 85
Most parents are ready for any sacrifice, any renunciation
for the well-being of their child, once it is born. But for its
greatest possible well-being potential parents — and that
means all youth — must be willing to keep their bodies in
such a condition that a faultless seed and a perfect soil shall
be available for the prenatal growth. Almost as a rule how
ever the male contribution to the seed has been weakened,
and very often infected with inheritable disease, by abuse
of the reproductive organs. And where in the past at least
the soil — the mother's body — used to offer the foetus a
fair chance, this factor too is more and more exposed to
vitiation. Mankind seems to deteriorate deliberately into
animalistic parents of an ever more wretched posterity.
Any tampering with the sexual function before it is
being used for the conception of a child endangers the purity
of the seed and of the soil. Promiscuity is particularly fateful
in this respect, because in the intimacy of the sexual act each
of the partners leaves a permanent impression on the other.
Traces of these impressions are carried to later partners,
and eventually to descendants. Physical proof of this lies in
"the recognized fact that for a white woman, when stamped
with the sexual vibrations of other races, ... to bring forth
a white child, even in conjunction with a male of the white
race, is impossible."7 Similarly the prospective father brings
with him the commingled, usually polluting influences of
every woman with whom he has sexually conjoined. And
these influences affect not only the physical constitution;
they are much farther reaching in their effect, for "pro
miscuity in sex commerce adulterates the soul essences."8
Therefore unbroken virginity of both prospective parents
until they come together for intended propagation is an es
sential eugenic requirement.
Not less important for the progeny than sexual purity
of the parents before intended reproductive action is the
avoidance of ardent passion during coitus. For "carnal pas
sions are transmitted . . . through conception in the fire
of lust."9 "The union of two bodies . . . need not be spoiled
by vulgar sensuality, if a powerful affinity of souls imparts

to it the ideal character of an appeal for their unborn
child."10 A higher evolved ego can thus be attracted.
Another notable eugenic requisite is absolute sexual ab
stinence during the period of gestation and of nursing. "Un
disturbed maternity ... is a vital and indisputable ne
cessity for the improvement of humanity."11
"If humanity would follow strictly the edicts of nature
. . . coition would be absolutely omitted during the ges
tation period."1' "The whole force at these times should be
taken up with providing sustenance for the new body."" If
only for this reason, "sexual intercourse should cease when
the purpose of nature is fulfilled."14 But another reason for
its cessation is that, when exercised, "it is very often found
to be injurious to pregnant women."15 "The venereal orgasm
has the character of a violent nervous crisis"16, and "in their
condition . . . every nervous commotion has its danger.""
In normal individuals "it should be repugnant to the female
during gestation. Where it is not, there is hereditarily per
verted sexual physiology due to the unphysiologic approa
ches of the male practised through the ages."18
Some "obstetric writers have . . . granted a license
which leads to more evil than good."19 For "it is a more fre
quent cause of premature confinement than is commonly
supposed."20 Also it "is not unseldom a cause of miscar
riage"", and "increases the pain and danger connected with
child birth."12 Therefore "from an early period great author
ities have declared themselves in opposition to the custom
of practising coitus during pregnancy."" "Even uncivilized
nations have condemned the practice."" And "medical
science is beginning to utter the same warning, and before
long will probably be in a position to do so on a more solid
and coherent evidence."2*
An indication of scientific evidence has already come to
light in favor of postponement of resumption of conjugal
relations until after a baby has been weaned. It is contained
in the discovery that prolactin, produced by glands in the
mother's body for the purpose of stimulating milk-secretion,
at the same time inhibits the sex glands — thereby calling
for abstinence from intercourse as long as feeding from the

breast continues. "It seems to show that parental behavior
[such as suckling] and sex activity are antipathetic, by
glandular decree.""
Foremost in eugenic interest remains the fact that "sex-—
ual commerce during pregnancy [and also during the lac
tation period] is a violation of the rights of the unborn
ego.""
Apart from physical considerations one of those rights
is the opportunity to be born without such anti-evolutionary
tendencies as can be forestalled by the parents. They have
to consider that "such is the intimate connection between
the mother and the embryo that the exercise of any faculty
or of any organ of her body stimulates . . . the correspond
ing faculty or organ of the incipient child."*8 On account
of this impressionability of the embryo "couples bring upon
themselves by their sensuality the curse of sensual off
spring."" For "one of the most certain effects of sexual in
dulgence during pregnancy is to develop abnormally the
sexual impulses in the child. Here is the key to the origin
of much of the sexual precocity and depravity which curs?
humanity"30, and which stand in the way of evolutionary
growth.
Truly eugenic parents are those who limit sexual activ
ity to intended reproduction. "They are the direct benefac
tors of the race by begetting progeny who are not predis
posed to vitiation."31 They prove that "sexual continence
is not only an ascetic but also an altruistic demand."32 It is
by far the most essential precept for the evolutionary im
provement of the race.
"Future generations will probably with a kind of horror
look back at a period when the most important function
which has fallen to the lot of man was entirely left to . . .
caprice and lust."33 "In the future . . . this will be carried
on with a degree of conscious intelligence hitherto unknown,
which will raise it from the following of a mere impulse to
the completion of a splendid social purpose."34

XXIV
ADOLESCENCE
"You just maturing youth ! You male
or female !
Anticipate your own life . . . Retract
in time."
— Whitman, Poem of Remembrance.
Adolescence, the time of maturing youth, is that "stormy
period . . . when the very worst and best impulses in the
human soul struggle against each other for its possession."1
Every impulse that is allowed freedom of expression at this
time leaves an indelible impression on the rest of life.
During adolescence the sexual element develops in the
body and tries to press its claims. Overstimulated from with
in and from without and encouraged by popular casuistry
it clamors for satisfaction before it is matured. But if sex
is yielded to prematurely, then to the same extent that this
is done the individual will literally 'run to seed'. "Many an
individual has had reason to regret the indulgences of his
youth because of . . . their effect upon his further life."1
Whenever allowed expression, "early forms of indul
gence interfere with normal growth of body, of emotions
and of mind"8, as well as with spiritual unfoldment. Growth
in each of these directions is dependent upon the same force
as is the sexual faculty. That life force, "if expended in one
channel ... is lost for another."4 "The longer its outlet
towards sex is deferred . . . the greater is the refinement
and breadth and strength of character resulting."8
Hence if the growth toward a perfected humanity is to
be aided, "a delay in entering actively on the sexual life
must be one of the adaptations that has to go along with
evolution.'" It is the only way to give the higher faculties a
chance to come into expression at all. Therefore "the result
of evolution . . . has been to lengthen the period of devel
opment."7 The animal matures very quickly, but only phys
ically ; and during its maturation nature takes care, through

instinct, that no force is wasted in sexual channels. Savages
develop physically and emotionally ; by taboo8 the unspoiled
tribes are restrained from premature sexual expression. Civ
ilized individuals must pass through an additional mental
development, and the period of adolescence is therefore nec
essarily prolonged. For young people sexual "restraint is in
dispensable during a period of more and more years . . .
if they are to mature well."9
"The only way to an ever higher and fuller maturity
... is by self-restraint"10, by perfect sexual abstinence
during an ever longer period of adolescence. In the average
individual at the present time "complete maturity is reached
by the woman after the twentieth . . . and by the man not
before the twenty-fifth year."11 As evolution advances and
spiritual development is added to the mental, the period of
adolescence and of needed absolute juvenile continence will
be still more extended.
The indisputable fact that strict continence is at no time
more important than during adolescence has been recog
nized and stressed by every student of the subject. Yet the
false rumor "that sexual abstinence be injurious ... is ex
erting a most pernicious influence upon youth."1' In reality
"abstinence can in no way injure them."13 Whereas "pre
mature sexual acts mean . . . shortened lives."14 "Not that
continence alone assures a long life, but . . . it is an evi
dent contribution to longevity."15 In every individual case
the maximum length of life attainable undoubtedly depends
very much upon the preservation of the life force. The
amount of this force available in one individual or another
may vary greatly ; each one seems limited to whatever quo
tum fate has put at his disposal. But a misdirected spending
of one's energies will tend to shorten the physical existence
and reduce the balance on which to draw for other essential
and beneficial purposes.
A point deserving special attention is that "the sexual
... is in closest connection with the cerebral system."1'
"The immediate effect of sexual desire upon the brain . . .
is sometimes very marked."17 "The nerves that supply the
sexual centers are directly connected with the brain by

means of the spinal canal ; if those nerves become weakened
the brain is at once effected to a corresponding degree."18
This is why "the tampering with the sexual impulse tends
to produce a lasting impression on the cerebral centers"1',
and also why "sexual indulgence is ruinous to mental
health."20
"The brain and the sexual organs are . . . great rivals
in using up bodily energy."21 "When the reproductive organs
make demands . . . they can be satisfied only at the ex
pense of the brain."22 Therefore "premature sexual activity
impairs the educability of the child."28 "Early sexual ex
pression signs away the highest reaches of individual devel
opment"24, which otherwise could be attained. "It produces
mediocrity and conventionality of mind."25
"The intellectual life of a whole nation must suffer if
sexual activity is the rule among its young people."28
In a general way "idealism is one of the most splendid
characteristics of adolescent youth."27 Especially "the joy,
the cordial merriment, the sunny confidence of vigorous
young people who have remained chaste are characteristic
traits." Such youths are also the most gentle and sensitive,
open to poetic inspiration and to enthusiastic support of
Utopian movements.
But as soon as youth yields to the sordidness of sexual ex
pression for self-gratification, or to indulgence in erotic
thoughts, the splendid enthusiasm disappears, often to make
place for a cynical materialism. So much of the life force is
then wasted on the sexual level that none can be transformed
into the higher energy on which aspiration and idealism
depend. Thus "continence ... is connected with ideal as
pirations no less than with physical vigor"29 and with men
tal clarity. Therefore the way to maintain a strong and pure
idealism through life is to adhere to continence.
For many reasons then "the ideal of chastity is . . . the
very highest that can be held up to youth."30 "If it is the
effort of their lives to be chaste . . . then, indeed, shall
abide for them an incorruptible felicity"31 ; then the corner
stone for a future Utopia has been laid.

SEX AND NUTRITION
"There is ... a direct contrast be
tween the processes of conjugation
and nutrition."
— Weismann, Essays upon Heredity,
I.v.493-
A presumed analogy between sex and nutrition is fre
quently put forth in support of a pretended imperiousness
of sexual intercourse. But in reality there is more contrast
than analogy between the two. Nutrition sustains the life
force, whereas sex consumes it. And while "food and drink
are vital necessities . . . the generative impulse does not
serve any vital necessity"1, at least not of the individual.
"The function of reproduction ... is not essential to the
maintenance of the organism."1 "Men can survive without
it,
whereas they can not survive without food or drink."3
If reproduction were entirely stopped the race would
perish. But the continuation of the race does not require that
everybody takes part in its propagation. Therefore, while
the digestive system
is
designed for regular activity, "the
sexual organs are constructed for intermittent action, and
their functions may be suspended without harm to either
their anatomy or physiology."4 And "the sexual appetite,
unlike hunger or thirst, can ... be reduced to
a
more or
less quiescent state which, far from injuring, may benefit the
physical and psychic vigor generally.'" In fact, "one may
live without carnal activity
.
.
. and never better than
without it."7
Another distinction between sex and nutrition
is
that
nutrition
is
inherently
a
selfish function, serving self-preser
vation; whereas the sexual act as intended by nature
is
an
unselfish function in which the individual sacrifices
a
frag
ment of himself for the sake of the preservation of the race.
"Nutrition implies an increase in the capital of the body
.
. . Reproduction always means
a
parting with some of

the living material."8 While to part with this for the sake
of the species is an act of self-sacrifice, doing so for selfish
gratification without a chance of benefitting the race is but
injurious self-waste.
The only clear analogy between nutrition and sex lies
in the fact that both are allowed to play too prominent a
part in human existence. Instead of using them as natural
means by which to keep oneself and the race alive, human
ity has chosen to live and work mainly in order to satisfy its
self-created inordinate desire for unnatural food and drink
beyond the needs of nutrition, and for unnatural sex ex
pression beyond the needs of reproduction.
Nature has implanted in living beings a nutritive and a
reproductive appetite only to the extent of her own needs :
to ensure individual and racial preservation. And "she has
intermingled pleasure with necessary things ... in order
that the addition of pleasure may make the indispensable
means of existence attractive to us"9, so that they shall not
be neglected. But "this bait of gratification is merely a de
vice of nature and not in itself an end which has any useful
function."10 In unadulterated form "no appetite exists . . .
for its own sake merely, just to be gratified."11
However, nutrition and sex "both are alike subject to
abuse by those who pursue the pleasure of gratification of
the animal appetites with disregard of their natural ob
jects."1* Out of both, in his continuous search of pleasure
for pleasure's sake, man has distilled a means of sense-grati
fication. Both impulses have been perverted by overstimula
tion and by habitual indulgence.
Both of these forms of abuse are degrading, and obstruc
tive to evolutionary growth. But the abuse of sex is the more
injurious one, since it always consists in a deleterious way
of spending vital elements, while the common errors in nu
trition rarely omit a taking in of at least some body-building
material.
Basically everything beyond nature's simple needs is
unnatural. Hence many other factors of civilized existence
may have to be regarded as not exactly natural. But none
of those other items are comparable with sex or with nutri

tion, since none affect the body as an instrument for spirit
like these two.
By the indulgence of the nutritive as well as of the re
productive function false cravings get ever stronger, and the
body becomes more and more engrossed, so that a response
to higher vibrations is made impossible. Indulgence in eva
nescent physical pleasures is ever at the cost of abiding spir
itual joys.

GLANDS AND SECRETIONS
"Certain glands are much influenced
by thinking ... of the condition!
under which they are excited."
— Darwin, Expression of the Emo-
iionj,xiii,33g.
Wondrous beyond human understanding are the work
ings of the glands, the biochemical factories in living bodies.
Substances on which the body depends for its development
and sustenance are manufactured by the glands from ma
terials which they extract out of the mass of heterogeneous
food that is put into the stomach.
Left to themselves the glands perform their tasks in
stinctively according to nature's needs "in a manner which
the most learned can neither understand nor explain"1 ; their
activity is backed by an intelligence that is not equalled by
the greatest intellect of man. As long as not interfered with,
the glands produce and contribute to the processes of life
just the kind of secretion that is needed, just when and
where it is needed. They do this in response to messages
originating in any part of the body requiring their particu
lar product. So well has nature's intelligence arranged it
that these messages, upon arriving at the gland, automati
cally stimulate it into accordant action. "Glands in general
secrete only under the influence of some special stimula
tion."1
Man has interfered with nature's normal stimulations
and with the normal functioning of glands. With artificial
excitations he has forced some glands to serve his pleasure,
to work overtime, to overproduce secretions. Especially has
he overstimulated the glands that are connected with nutri
tion and with sex — particularly with sex.
"Modern physiology has emphasized the dual function
of the essential reproductive glands, the ovaries and the

testes."* "The ovaries are strictly analogous to the testes."4
Both produce external secretions for the generation of new
bodies. And both "testes and ovaries produce internal secre
tions"5 for the upbuilding and regeneration of one's own
body. These internal secretions play no part in the sexual
act and are never expelled, but always taken up by the
blood. "While the external ... is what might be called the
racial secretion, the internal is necessary for the individual's
welfare."4
In regard to the internal secretions "the cases of the two
sexes are . . . strictly parallel."7 Apart from "giving rise
to the development of the secondary sexual characters'"
they "are essential for physical and mental manhood and
womanhood."5 "The testes secrete substances which pass
into the circulation and are of immense importance in the
development of the organism."10 These substances are the
internal secretions which also "add enormously to a man's
magnetic and spiritual force."" And in woman "the ovaries
elaborate an internal secretion which is absorbed by the
system and which is necessary to the physical and spirit
ual well-being of woman.""
"Modern science . . . recognizes in the internal secre
tion of the sex glands the necessary factor for the right func
tioning of the whole organism, and in its weakening the
cause of the deterioration of all other functions."1' Hence
"there is no surer way to destroy existing manhood [or wo
manhood] than such a course of life as deprives the body
of this internal secretion."14 Sexual activity has a deleterious
effect in this respect.
Unfortunately the individual has the power to use the
external or racial secretions for other than racial, propaga-
tive purposes. The tragedy of this is that by every act which
disposes of some external secretion "the formation of the
internal ... is undoubtedly interfered with."15 When com
pelled to produce more external secretions than required
for generation, the sex glands cannot supply the normal
amount of internal secretions for regeneration.
"The physical harm in the habitual overproduction [of
external secretion] . . . seems to lie in the fact that it

drains from the blood nutriment which is needed for the
production of internal secretion."1* "The best- blood of the
body goes to form the ingredients for reproduction in both
sexes."17 "The richest elements of that blood are used in the
distillation of the reproductive fluids."18 The more these ele
ments are extracted from the blood for the formation of ex
ternal, the less they are available for internal secretions and
for the essential processes which depend thereon. The whole
body suffers when these vital elements are wasted.
,.Not only every sexual act but all "irritation of the sex
organs interferes with the formation of the internal secre
tion."19 Hence not only every wasteful sexual expression but
also every irritating stimulation of the sex impulse takes
place at the cost of self-regeneration, mental and spiritual
—
as well as physical.
Even where the use of the external secretions is limited
to generation in harmony with natural law, the formation of
internal secretions is unfavorably affected. This in itself
makes reproduction a sacrificial act. In such a case however
the loss in spiritual potentialities is compensated by the sac
rificial element in the purely generative act. But in every
sexual expression which lacks propagative intention there is
naught but loss on the regenerative side — a greater and
more irreparable loss according to the frequency of the in
dulgence.
The prominent part played by the internal secretions of
the sex glands of both men and women in every phase of
individual development has been discovered only in modern
times. This new knowledge confirms the idea that in order
to make possible an advancement in evolution, more and
more of the life force must be taken away from generative
activity and turned into regenerative channels*0 ; for it shows
that this force, instead of being used for the formation of the
generative external, must be directed to the production of
the regenerative internal secretions of the sex glands.
Since the production of those important secretions de
pends on the well-functioning of the sex glands, it is evi
dently essential to the physical, mental and spiritual well-
being of the individual that these glands are normally de

veloped. Where the glands are deficient there can be no
efficient internal secretions. This fact however has been
widely misunderstood and often wilfully misinterpreted. It
is quite erroneous to think that the glands must prove their
normal efficiency in sexual expression, and that they must
be kept in condition by such activity. Quite to the contrary
— and as already emphasized in this chapter — the right
functioning of these glands for the benefit of the individual
is interfered with by every sexual act.
The best proof of the well-functioning of the sex glands
is to be found in as sound a physical body as other prevailing
factors will permit, in a clear idealistic mind, and in a
progressive spiritual growth of the individual.

XXVII
A PHYSIOLOGICAL DILEMMA
"The reabsorption of semen can
scarcely be said to be a part of the
modern physiological doctrine."
— Ellis, Studies in the Psychology
of Sex,V,iBo.
It is not the intention of this study to delve into physio
logical details. But some facts have been so misunderstood
and twisted into motives for unwarranted sexual acts, that
it is unavoidable to speak about them if current wrong
impressions are to be counteracted.
Until a few years ago it was generally held that man's
body could absorb the external secretions produced by its
sex glands after these secretions had accumulated in the
vesicles. But the possibility of such absorption has now by
a few physiologists been doubted and by some denied.
Yet, one of the greatest modern authorities admits the
possibility of conditions under which "the highly vital fluid
. . .
is,
partially at least, reabsorbed and acts as
a
tonic to
the entire system."1 Others too are still convinced that
it
is
feasible that "the secretions ... are reabsorbed, partly
at least, by the rich plexi of lymphates which surround the
canals."2 Apparently the question
is
not definitely settled.
Most likely the absorption
is
neither impossible, nor always
possible for the entire amount secreted.
It
seems that any
how "in the continent person . . . the semen
is
partly
reabsorbed."3
That there
is
repeated mention of only partial absorption
is
not surprising. That nearly always "whatever absorption
takes place ...
is
less than what
is
produced"4
is
to be
ascribed to the circumstance that in almost every case there
is
an unnatural overproduction which overtaxes the capacity
of whatever apparatus for absorption exists.
In present humanity the sex glands have
a
tendency to
form external secretions in larger quantities than are needed

A Physiological Dilemma . ... iqi.
for reproduction. Racial habits have denatured these glands.
They have long been artificially habituated to produce
external secretions steadily instead of only when needed for
propagation. They have been inured to yield an unnatural
overproduction, just as the lactic glands of the dairy cow
have been trained to yield an abnormal overproduction.
"Under conditions of right thinking and right living the
seminal fluid would be produced only when there is a
demand for propagation." Formation of reproductive fluids
at times when there is no question of propagation is as un
natural and abnormal as the formation of milk when there
is no question of motherhood.
Once formed, the accumulation of reproductive fluids is
apt to cause some discomfort, even strain. This tension is
usually mistaken for a manifestation of the reproductive
impulse. But almost without exception the formation of the
fluid by the sex glands results as little from the natural re
productive impulse as the flow of saliva at the thought or
sight of a delicacy results from a natural hunger. Both
conditions are caused by artificial stimulation and undue
imagination. "A man accustomed to abstinence will not
suffer from any accumulation of secretions"5, and "the
longer the period of continence the less of the irritation and
discomfort will be felt."7
The tension of the accumulated external secretion has
given rise to "the view met with among the ignorant . . .
that this fluid rnight be noxious if allowed to accumulate.
It is regarded as an excretion to be got rid of like those of
the bladder and the intestines."8 This view of the supposed
necessity of expelling the reproductive fluid is supported
by the new theory of non-absorption. But "everything rel
evant that is known in biology and physiology indicates that
nothing could be more false and pernicious.'"
The external secretion of the sex glands is "a vital fluid
representing far greater potentiality than the same quantity
of blood."10 "It is not a waste material"11, and one "posi
tively and directly gains by the absorption of that secre
tion."1' "This is evidenced by increased muscular action, a
diminished sense of fatigue and enhanced recuperative

ness."1' Undoubtedly "the more the fluids are retained in
the body . . . the greater fulness of life, health and power
are experienced."14
Therefore under no circumstances apart from propaga
tion should the external secretion be expelled voluntarily.
If a surplus really should be removed, nature will do so
without any voluntary action of the person and with a
minimum loss of physical and psychic energy."
After all, it matters little whether absorption of the re
productive fluids is possible or not. The essential point con
cerns not the way in which they are disposed of after being
formed, but their non-formation. If their formation is pre
vented except in the service of propagation, absorption be
comes superfluous.
Of the greatest practical value is that the formation and
accumulation of these external secretions is avoidable. Even
the inherited tendency to their overproduction can be over
come if it is not reinforced by ever new excitations. The
infallible way is to lessen the erotic stimuli. As a result of
this it becomes possible to utilize the vital elements of the
blood constantly for the formation of the inner secretions",
which enhance the development of greater physical and
mental and spiritual power.

by erotic desire."
— Nystrom, Natural Laws of Sexual
In the consciousness of man an important part is played
by what psychoanalysts have termed 'the censor'.
"Deeply implanted in man's nature there is the deter
mination not to be content with oneself as one
is,
but some
how to be cleaner and higher; to suppress and reduce to
nothingness the sort of things that drag one down, and to
concentrate attention and effort on the higher parts of one's
being."1 The so-called censor may well be interpreted as
being an embodiment of that determination, that urge to
reach an ever higher evolutionary stage. He can also be
considered to be "the impartial spectator . . . the judge
within"1, who
is
a
personification of conscience, warning
against actions that are inconsistent with the stage which
the individual has reached. Thus the censor
is
the equivalent
of "the good demon which every man has as
a
proper
keeper ... to bring him to perfection."3
Ultimately the" censor represents spirit, albeit only a
negative, inhibiting aspect thereof. The power of the
censor depends upon how much of spirit can manifest
through
a
person. The more spiritual one becomes the
louder the censor warns against an ever wider range of
tendencies which must be outgrown. In effect the censor
acts as "a guiding principle which can be developed as
a
regulative, but which
is
easily obscured."4
In many people the censor
is
indeed very easily obscured.
Especially often "during sleep the censorship ...
is
re
moved.'" And even during the waking state old tendencies
frequently succeed in passing the censor to find expression,
if
not in acts then in emotions and in thoughts of
a
less
desirable nature.

104 The Coiled Serpent
To a great extent the thoughts of the day shape the
dreams of the night. "The waking thoughts and emotions
have a powerful and determining influence upon the activi
ties of the consciousness during the hours when the physical
body is asleep."8 "In almost every dream certain details
are found which have their origin in the impressions or
thoughts ... of one of the preceding days'" — or some
times in seemingly forgotten impressions of longer ago.
What kind of dreams can one expect when, after sensual
stirrings have been admitted during waking hours, censor
ship is removed during sleep? It is but natural that then,
"the higher inhibitions gone . . . the lower passions surge
to the front in turbulent welter."8 And it is no wonder that
"many of the phenomena of dreams . . . are due to the
sexual impulse."*
"Even in good men there is a latent wild-beast nature
which peers out in sleep"10; and perhaps in women too.
"When the reasoning and ruling power is asleep, then the
wild beast in human nature . . . starts up and leaps about
and seeks to satisfy its desires."11 Then "the serpent is . . .
ever fruitful in alluring dreams.
"u
Then it is that "sexual
excitement entertained in a waking state . . . induces
ejaculation during sleep."1*
The passive involuntary nocturnal orgasms undoubtedly
are less harmful than any passionate voluntary mode of
sexual expression. Once the sex glands have formed an
oversupply of external secretion — which however should
have been prevented14 — it is better to lose this unconsciously
during sleep than to cause its expulsion in a conscious act.
But in the majority of cases "the generative glands would
not form such an excess of secretion ... if they were not
- overstimulated or overworked."1*
The fact that nocturnal losses are very general does not
mean that they are normal. On the contrary "such emissions
are always more or less abnormal."1* Nor does it mean that
they are necessary. "Health does not require that there
ever should be an emission."1' The less frequently they
occur the better. Always "their frequency varies according
to . . . the degree in which the mind is directed to sexual

matters."18 "One who stimulates the mind with erotic
fancies . . . will experience them with greater frequency."1'
But "the more the mind while awake is occupied with other
than sexual matters . . . the less frequent the excitements
and emissions during sleep.'"0 "They rarely occur in those
. . . who most nearly approach the standard of perfect
chastity.""
"Some continent persons never have nocturnal emis-
sions.
"It is a mistake to believe that emissions during the
dream state cannot be controlled."" The censor can be
made to function during sleep as well as during the waking
hours. "In the dreamer there exists an unconscious pro
pensity to conceive his erotic experiences as guilty."" He is
vaguely aware that "emissions in sleep pollute."" "The
reluctance of the will even during sleep to consent to the
tendencies of the sexual system, strengthens the idea of
moral impurity in relation to the nocturnal pollution"" ; it
also shows that the censor is not always entirely off duty.
A little exercise of the will can force him to remain alert
while one sleeps. "With many people indeed the will power
becomes sufficiently awake to allow of their inhibiting the
pollution when on the point of occurring.""
In order to prevent emissions during dreams, therefore,■
exertion of will and control of thought are necessary. Es
pecially "the last thought as one sinks into slumber has an
influence out of all proportion of the time it occupies the
mind."" "When before going to sleep one has awakened
his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts . . .
then one is least likely to be the sport of fanciful visions.""
Thus can any one keep mind and body pure in the
dreaming as well as in the waking state, and thereby fill a
necessary requirement for spiritual evolution.

XXIX
PERVERSION
"Every expression of the sexual im
pulse that does not correspond with
nature's purpose of propagation must
be regarded as perverse."
— Krafft-Ebino, Psychopathia Sex-
"From the point of view of nature the end and object of
the sexual impulse is procreation."1 Therefore "every
sexual act not having in view the propagation of the species
is perverse."2 This is true whether the act be solitary or
mutual ; whether heterosexual with intended unproductive
ness, or homosexual; whether to be classed as prostitution
or as birth control ; whether technically labeled as inversion
or as perversion ; and whether the tendency to such acts be
congenital or acquired. "None of these acts have in view
the perpetuation of the species, and all are therefore per
versions."3 From the sociological point of view they may
differ in degree of reprehensibility ; but from the spiritual
standpoint they are all equally objectionable and corrupt.
What some writers have said about specific sexual aber
rations may well be applied to all perversions of the re
productive impulse. They are "a sad pathological acquisi
tion of the human race"4, "contrary to nature and . . . due
to unbridled lust."5 They are "the negation of the higher
order of things'", "ethically reprehensible"7, and "destruc
tive of everything noble and dignified in human nature."'
They "deprive the system at large of what might have
become general stimulation and vitality"9, and "there is a
continuously greater strain upon the nervous system."10 In
their addicts "self-control is being undermined"11, to such
an extent that "the person who shows sex abnormalities is
potentially the most dangerous casual criminal."11 And
"worse than any of these effects are those that appear in
the offspring"13, for "acquired sexual perversion may be
... an irradicable vice in the next generation."14 In short,

not only "from the unnatural loves of either sex ... in
numerable evils have come"15, but from every sexual per
version in the widest sense great evils have fallen upon
individuals and upon humanity.
It is true of every sexual perversion that "the practice is
contrary to the ends of humanity ; for the end of humanity
in respect to sexuality is to preserve the species without de
basing the person."1' All perverse sexual acts do just the
opposite: without preserving the species they debase the
person; they interfere with the possibility of the soul's
normal development.
Also, "he who indulges in them ... is the reverse of
happy."" "If humanity is ever to be capable of being
raised to a condition of true happiness . . . passions must
diminish."18
Pathological results of the most frequently occurring
forms of perversion have been so often overstated that now
even a conservative statement of the truth1' finds little
credence. But after all, the "psychic effect ... is even
more deleterious than the physical."*1 Of any perversion
"the effects on the higher qualities are not easily exagger
ated."11 "Far more serious than any physical impairment
. . . is the impairment of the idealism and the nobility of
life."" "The finer endowments of man suffer graver lesions
than do the physical."13 Every perversion "inevitably coar
sens . . . man's whole moral and spiritual fiber."14 "It is
. . . mere sense pleasure bought at the cost of the higher
life."15
The modern way of looking upon perversion is to ex
tenuate and to condone it on the ground that it is often the
result of inborn tendencies, or of specific glandular defects.
On this same basis all crime, too, should then be excused
and tolerated ; for undoubtedly the criminal as well as the
pervert in many cases descends from tainted progenitors, or
has deficient endocrines. To recognize this may lead to a
better understanding of their disordered condition and to
the discovery of means by which to help, to correct, to cure
them. It should also lead to ways of eugenically preventing

But it does not mitigate the fact that perversion and crime
both are intolerable abnormalities. Counteracting spiritual
evolution, they cause mankind's devolution. They must
necessarily be eliminated wherever the aim of society is

SEXUAL NORMALCY
"Man has deliberately taken the
sexual appetite . . . away from its
natural, normal manifestation."
— Atkinson, Regenerative Power,
",145.
As a race we are oversexed. By habitual indulgence, by
cumulative heredity, by influence of surroundings, and by
seeking or submitting to stimulation, the human sexual
impulse has long since been developed to a state far beyond
its natural normalcy. "The excessive sex urge in man bears
the stamp of ... a compulsion which is unnatural."1
Normal sexuality has been replaced by abnormal sensuality.
The sex impulse is natural only as long as "the funda
mental design of the sexual act — propagation"2 is in view.
At the evolutionary stage which most of humanity should
have reached by now the biological urge is entirely normal
only when it drives mate to mate in a longing to call forth
another living being out of a union of the highest that each
is able to contribute. When the urge appears at other times
it is abnormal and ought to be considered pathological. And
at such other times "to yield to the biological is to betray
the spiritual."3
Normal human evolution calls for a steady ascent from
the stage of animal instinct to that of spiritual self-con
sciousness and power. But the blinding glare of oversexed-
ness has drawn humanity to bide and settle down in bypaths
of evolution and to ignore the goal of the ascent toward
spiritual heights. Oversexedness is an abnormal develop
ment which causes a delay, if not a permanent break in
evolutionary growth.4
Yet so almost general a symptom has oversexedness
become that it is erroneously regarded as a normal, natural
condition. "Where practice is so general, theory has accom
modated itself so far as to assume that sexual intercourse

. . . is necessary and wholesome."5 Public opinion on this
point is misled by the peculiar quality of the human body
that it readily accustoms itself to whatever habit it acquires,
soon craves for
it,
and protests when the demands of the
habit are not regularly obeyed. Once accustomed to alcohol
or drugs or to sexual excitement
a
body manifests discomfort
when its craving for gratification
is
not satisfied. This has
led to the fallacy that
it
is
necessary and even healthy to
supply the gratification in order to remove the discomfort.
But the normal, natural way to eliminate the latter
is
to
ignore
it,
and to prevent its repetition by establishing
a
purer
standard. Not
a
single habit can constitute
a
necessity.
Even where the tendency to
a
habit
is
inborn
it
can be
overcome, provided the mind begins to see that the habit
is
undesirable. The first requirement for sexual normalcy
is,
therefore,
a
mental recognition that the present sexual habits
of the race are abnormal. Then the individual will either
avoid to become addicted — or,
if
already an addict, will
gradually break away from those habits.
It
should be clear to any one that "the existence of
a
sexual excitation ...
is
not sufficient to prove that
it
is
normal."' But "in judging of matters relating to sexual
morality men have generally made little use of their
reason."7 Abnormal stimulation of the sexual function has
biased the discriminative faculty which
is
needed to dis
tinguish between natural and unnatural, between normal
and abnormal. The prejudiced opinion of many who wish
to justify their personal tendencies leads them to scoff the
purer normal standard and to decry this as though
it
were
abnormal and morbid.
This mistaken attitude
is
shared by many others who are
misguided by the thought that normalcy
is
measured by the
condition of
a
majority. But absolute normalcy does not
consist in what the majority may do or think or be. In the
absolute sense our oversexedness — howsoever widespread
it
may be —
is
an abnormal symptom;
it
is
as much
a
deviation from normal sexuality as our general low rate of
health
is
a
departure from normal well-being. Humanity
has caused its general lack of health as well as most of its

other misery largely by its digression from nature's normal
standards.8 "Misery is nature's protest against degenera
tion.'" Every wilful deviation from nature's normalcy is
therefore followed by a severe and often painful reaction,
even if that result is not always immediately apparent.18
In present humanity almost every one seems to prefer to
remain complacently in the hedonic state of oversexedness,
and to be indifferent to its deleterious results for the in
dividual and for the race. In the general tendency of ready
surrender to its dictates "the imperiousness of the sex
impulse has been greatly overrated."11 But "the sexual
appetite is not insuperable."1* With a little strength of
character and of will it is not very difficult to overcome the
-abnormal drive of this urge. Only "weaklings yield to
- sexual impulses which the normally strong feel but repress."13
After recognizing that sexual normalcy consists in purity,
people of high principles free themselves from the grip of
sex. Rising above all erotic influences and conditions, they
take up again the long interrupted ascent toward the highest
goal of human evolution : spiritual unfoldment."

CONTINENCE
"If one is gaited to idealism . . .
continence should make powerful ap
peal to him."
— Collins, The Doctor Looks at
Love and Life,
Threaded through all the pages of this book, even where
but faintly showing between the lines, is the ever recurrent
thought that the ideal sexual life is one of strict continence.
Continence : the word is not used here loosely to denote
moderation, in which sense it is so often applied to the very
flexible moral standard of most people. "By continence is
meant the voluntary and entire abstinence from sexual in
dulgence in any form."1 Strict continence is meant ; abso
lute abstinence except for purposes of propagation ; "absti
nence not only from the gratification of the impulse . . .
but also from mental and tactile caresses and from all ab
normal practices."* All such "dalliance is not abstinence."*
And because "continence is not compatible with sexual
excitement"4 of any kind, "it must involve a permanent
abstention from indulgence in erotic imaginations and
voluptuous reverie"5 and "from any of the factors which
arouse the sexual passion.'"
Perfect "sexual continence ... as an ideal to be striven
for . . . cannot be dismissed as a mere monk-made super
stition."7 Even for the most materialistic purposes the value
of abstinence has been generally acknowledged. It has
always been a rule for athletes while training for contests
and prize events. "This fact about athletes has been often
positively affirmed by the ancients"8; and strict abstinence
is still adhered to in our own days in the preparation of
participants for prizefights, league ball games and similar
sports. During the period of intensive training sexual excite
ment "is the one thing which is rigidly excluded.'"

The Coiled Serpent
Clearly it is considered worth while and possible even
for the most full-blooded and hard-muscled men to be
continent for a certain period for the sake of a chance to
win a prize in a competitive contest. It will be found to be
much more worth while, and just as possible, in the longer
period of training for the acquisition of the inestimable
prize of an expanded consciousness. This is the prize which
every one can win; for "the feeling of control and power
produced by continence plays its part in the production of
spiritual insight."10 For spiritual results, however, it must
include an obliteration of all sexual craving.
After an experimental period of an observance of con
tinence the next step will most naturally come in the form
of its permanent continuance. For it is only logical that
"what is profitable for a time should be always practised,
that it may be always profitable."11
Or "shall one be willing only to abstain from what is
ordinarily deemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in
wrestling and the like and ... be incapable of a similar
abstinence for the sake of a much nobler victory which is
the noblest of all?""
"There are enough sexual stoics in the world to prove by
experience that continence is not only possible but also
practical."13 "As every competent and responsible authority
asserts, it does no harm to the individual."14 "No one was
ever yet in the slightest degree the worse for perfect con
tinence."15 Where other factors do not counteract its
salutary influence there is "exuberance of health, life and
intelligence to be observed among chaste people."1'
The more continently one lives the better work one can
produce, because in body and in mind "energy is gained by
the establishment of continence."17 "It enlivens percep
tion."18 "One who consistently lives the continent life . . .
wins a power of concentration that is unknown to one who
trifles with the sex impulses."19 Thus, for instance, "the
abstinent scientist can devote more of his energy to study"",
accomplishing greater results. And this applies analogically
to any profession, to any accomplishment. "Only those who

have left the animal-man entirely behind are able to do the
best work in many spheres of life."11
Hence for the most matter-of-fact reasons one can follow
no more excellent rule of life than to "acquire continence as
the greatest wealth."13 And what makes this rule of para
mount value is that at the same time "one can save the
spiritual store in the body by observing continence.""

XXXII
THE NOTION OF NECESSITY
"The idea still prevails . . . because
it fits in with inclination."
— Woolston, Prostitution in the
t/.S.,I,iii,8o.
For humanity as a group "a sexual necessity exists only
in so far as the integrity of the race is concerned."1 But
there is no necessity of everybody's sharing in the task of
continuing the race.
For the individual "the idea of biological [sexual] neces
sity is so obviously coupled with selfish interests as to give
it the quality of a special bias."2 It "rose from the excuses
made by those whose lust controlled them."3 It is mislead -
ingly supported by some sexologists who would build a norm
for normal people on the basis of their abnormal 'cases'.
And it is almost ineradicable because "men . . . will accept
any doctrine that flatters their desires."4
In reality "so-called physical relief is never necessary."5
^The tradition of sex necessity is a dangerous lie, particu
larly as it is founded on the false assumption that cohabita
tion is essential to health.'" "This pitiable argument . . .
is a pure sophism."7 "It is a singularly false notion"8, "that
man's vitality is weakened unless he has indulgence. State
ments by eminent physicians flatly contradict this as
sumption."9
"The sexual functions may remain unused without any
injury to health."10 And this applies not only, as some
might think, to people of low vitality or little virility ; also
"a strong person can live and live well . . . without any
indulgence of the sex tendency."11 Therefore entirely re
futed must be "the lie that continence is dangerous to health,
for the opposite is true."1* "Continence is one of the con
ditions essential to the attainment and maintenance of the
highest degree of physical and mental vigor."11

The Notion of Necessity 117
"There is no physiological basis for . . . the irrespon
sible assertion that sexual intercourse is essential for the
maintenance of the healthy metabolisms of the normal
organism."14 "It is but a pernicious pseudo-physiology which
teaches that the exercise of the generative functions is neces
sary in order to maintain physical and mental vigor."14
"Science cannot subscribe to this"16 — the less so when con
sidering that in addition "there is no adequate evidence
that there is any intrinsic psychological necessity for sex
indulgence either in men or women."17 "Such necessity
is disproven by experience and is condemned by the best
medical authorities throughout the world."18 "Under no
circumstances can unchastity be either necessary or justi
fiable."1*
After all "the question as to the necessity of sexual inter
course . . . has wider bearings than in relation to health.""
Overlooked and denied as it may be by many, there is in
human existence something of far greater value than the
physical body, and than desire, and than intellect. The
well-being and the growth of the spiritual element is the
most important factor. And spiritual well-being depends
upon normalization and purification of all the elements of
individual existence.
As already brought out in various preceding chapters,
every yielding to the sexual impulse other than for propaga
tion, deters from spiritual attainment which is of paramount
value for evolutionary progress.

XXXIII
VIRILITY
"Sexual intercourse is not essential to
the preservation of virility."
— Winslow, The Family Physician,
V,i,257.
"It has been claimed that continence leads to impotence."1
But against this biased popular superstition many "dis
tinguished medical writers maintain . . . that abstinence
from sexual intercourse cannot be reckoned as a cause of
impotence."1 A large group of the foremost medical authori
ties has endorsed a declaration that "continence has not been
shown to be detrimental to . . . virility."3 Another medical
group has declared that "the sexual power is never lost
through abstinence from cohabitation, any more than the
ability to weep is lost through abstinence from weeping."4
This last statement hits the basic fallacy in the idea
that sex organs need exercise. For "the essential organs of
generation are not muscles but glands."5 And, unlike
muscles, glands require no exercise — certainly no volitional
exercise by their possessor — in order to keep the power to
function when nature requires it. Hence "the function of
the sexual apparatus may be held in abeyance . . . without
producing physical injury."8 Even after very long periods
of abstinence that apparatus can be "sound and capable
of being roused into activity."7
"If impotence exists after long abstinence it is not to be
ascribed to the abstinence but to . . . preoccupation with
sexual questions, overstimulation of the sexual disposition
and the like"8, because these irritate and thereby weaken
the organs. "A continent life, accompanied by a normal
mental outlook, never yet resulted in impotence."9 There
fore, above all, "normal people .... may practise conti
nence for many years or indefinitely without any loss of
sexual power."10 "There is no loss of power . . . provided

one does not keep the genital organs irritated"11, be it by
sensory or by mental stimuli.
"Atrophy caused by sexual abstinence . . . remains
scientifically unproven."11 In fact, "it may be affirmed that
no amount of continence ever caused atrophy."" Surely
"no continent person need be deterred from leading a chaste
life by the apocryphal fear of atrophy."14
What is likely to become apparent after a period of
strict continence is a normalization of what had been an
abnormally overstimulated, sensualized virility. In this
sense it is true that "the sexual appetite . . . diminishes
with abstinence"" — but not the latent virile power.
"If abstinence be rigidly adhered to, the desire mate
rially diminishes and a condition of sexual indifference en
sues. This is perfectly normal."" Its result is that a pre
viously existing unwholesome virility is apt to be reduced to
a normal ability to propagate without sensual desire. Far
from being detrimental, this normalization of the sexuality
can only be beneficial to a wholesome virility and salutary
to body and to spirit.

HEALTH AND DISEASE
"What an antiseptic is a pure life!"
—Lowell, My Study Windou>t,378.
"Disease is the disharmony which follows disobedience to
nature's laws"1; it is "a scourge to drive us back into
obedience to her laws."*
Every indulgence of the senses contrary to nature's pur
poses produces discord between man and nature. Whether
the indulgence consists in eating except for self-preservation,
or in sexual expression except for racial preservation — it
is bound to result in the disharmony that eventually becomes
manifest in the form of disease.*
"Each passion in man ... is capable of producing dis
ease."4 But especially "the misuse of the reproductive func
tion is the underlying cause of much sickness"5, because
"the lower pelvic region ... is capable of deranging every
bodily organ.'" "There is no one function which, if dis
turbed, leads so certainly to general ill-feeling'" or to
physical disorders, even though these often do not arise
until much later. It is almost true that "its misuse ... is
the cause of all misery and disease."*
Every use of the sexual function beyond intended race-
preservation constitutes a misuse, an excess. And "excess
. . . brings on disease, misery, suffering, mental and
physical."9 "Specialists agree . . . that the aggregate evils
arising from excesses of this kind are greater than those
arising from excesses of all other kinds put together."1'
It is largely through the abuse of the sex force that
"man is more diseased . . . than any animal."11 Free from
man's influence animals do not indulge in sexual congress
except in the season of rut.11 "The sexes become neutralized
during the rest of the year."13 "Thus their natural vitality
is greatly conserved and intensified in their seed."1* But
man's abuse of the sex force has gradually affected most of

the human seed, of the valuable germ-plasm, as a result of
which mankind "becomes with every century . . . more
dwarfed and weakened."15 By sexual self-gratification "man
has become ... a helpless, scrofulous being and . . . the
wealthiest heir to constitutional and hereditary diseases."1*
Through physical indulgence the human race is afflicted
"with puny and precarious healths and early deaths."1'
"The flesh of man is corrupt because by unwise cohabita
tion he has corrupted his race."18 "Illness ... is his fate
while his immortal spirit languishes in the bonds of sense."1'
Continence would be of the greatest help in humanity's
struggle against illness, because in the continent person the
undiminished internal secretions*0 of the sex glands are
better able to fulfill their task of keeping the system immune
to infections.21 Or where infection is already active in the
body these secretions can the more effectively combat the
disease-producing toxins" and prevent a serious outbreak.
And should actual disease be insuppressible and take its
course as a result from overruling causes, then a continent
life shall have enabled the patient to "save up force which
. . . greatly assists in the recuperative powers.
"M
Of course, those who abstain from indulgence cannot
immediately be vigorous and entirely free from ills. But
when there are pathological symptoms in one who abstains
from sexual acts there certainly is an "other cause than
continence for conditions of ill-health."M Entirely unfounded
and unfair is the popular tendency to ascribe to continence
whatever ails a continent person.
However, sometimes a diseased condition is caused in
one who is outwardly continent by what might well be
called an unchaste continence. When physical continence
is not combined with chastity in thoughts, there can be no
harmony, no balance in the body — hence no health. To
be thoroughly effective the continence must be positively
willed and supported from within, not but negatively and
grudgingly accepted from outer compelling circumstances.
Supported by inward purity, continence will lead unfail
ingly to greater strength and better health than would be
attainable otherwise.

Health and Disease 123
Health depends on too many different factors to be
permanently secured by continence alone. Heredity sets up
its limitations. Unwholesome habits have a lasting influence.
Overwork and worry frequently interfere. Often fatal to
physical well-being are dietetic errors — and hardly any one
knows how to avoid these. And sometimes health is dis
turbed when a person is developing spiritually while neglect
ing to give sufficient attention to a proportionate purifica
tion and spiritualization of the body; or while failing to
consider that the body, as it becomes a more delicate in
strument, requires different and greater care than before.
But whatever the momentarily disturbing factors, always
"in the direction of purity lie health and vitality.""

VENEREAL DISEASES
"Venereal disease ... in an edu
cated age will be unknown."
— Saleeby, Health, Strength and
Happiness jav,394.
On degenerated humanity venereal disease is a mark of
moral deficiency. It is an affliction, self-attracted by reck
lessly playing with the fire of life. Wherever this game is
played it exposes the players to the scourge of sexual disease.
Due to the popularity of the perilous sexual game
"diseases of the sexual function are more widespread and
cause greater misery and suffering than any other disease
of the human body, barring none."1 Those diseases are so
prevalent because "it is practically impossible to avoid
venereal infection when having illicit intercourse"1, espe
cially if this goes together — as it usually does — with pro-
miscuousness. "Wherever promiscuity . . . increases, there
venereal disease will certainly increase also."3
The incontestable argument against uncontrolled and
unrestricted sexual expression remains that "promiscuous
indulgence is sure, sooner or later, to bring infection by one
or both of the venereal diseases, gonorrhea and syphilis.'"
These two are "the infections which are so commonly
associated with the unwise exercise of the racial impulse."5
"They have been responsible for much of the misery in the
world"6, and "for vast suffering in the innocent as well as in
those who incur the direct results of their own conduct."7
Many "physicians know that the majority of diseases pecu
liar to women have their origin in a microscopic organism
which men harbor . . . and which is the relic of an infec
tion that has perhaps even been forgotten."*
"There is no warrant for ordinary students wading into
the pathology of the subject . . . The less pathology we
read the better."9 All such descriptions, as well as those of

anatomical and physiological details, may satisfy a prurient
curiosity ; but they have a tendency to stir up morbidity and
eroticism, and can rarely serve any edifying purpose.
Yet every one should know that "venereal diseases are
exceedingly grave."10 Every person should know something
about "the terrible consequences of both gonorrhea and
syphilis and the relationship of these diseases to incurable
conditions of many vital organs."11 "It is now established
. . . that gonorrheal infection results in numberless cases
in complications."1* "The whole organism may be in
volved."1' It has also been found that "syphilis . . . pre
disposes the organism to the attacks of other diseases."14
"It may become the cause of all maladies with which
humanity is afflicted"", "and these often become the
immediate cause of death"1*, be it years after the venereal
infection when there is no thought of connecting the new
symptoms with their true origin. Thus, indirectly, "syphilis
. . . actually causes more deaths than any other infection.""
Moreover, "what makes syphilis so exceedingly serious
in its consequences is the fact that it is capable of reacting
harmfully on subsequent generations."18 "It may destroy
the health and the very existence of the unborn children."19
"It is a cause of the degeneration of the race."" And gonor
rhea, while not directly inheritable as such, "is one of the
most formidable and far-reaching infections by which the
human race is attacked."11 Indirectly it is apt to cause
serious infantile infections." "Some high medical authorities
regard gonorrhea as even more serious in its social con
sequences than syphilis."13
"The insidious nature and destructive virulence of vene
real diseases"" should be more widely known in order to
offset the heedless way in which they are generally regarded.
"They are difficult to cure from the first, and almost
impossible when thoroughly lodged in the system."15 When
the outer symptoms have been suppressed the disease "often
settles down into a latent and dormant condition"18, and
"years afterwards the poison will break out."17

126 The Coiled Serpent
Usually quite "costly are the few fleeting moments of
sexual gratification — heavy and enduring the penalty to
be paid."28 "All protective devices, both mechanical and
medicinal, have failed to insure safety from the venereal
diseases. No method of absolutely insuring against infection
has been discovered"29 — except one: "continence . . .
would solve the problem"30
"Venereal disease is now so widespread that even for
prudential reasons purity should be observed by old and
))31
young.
Though fear is not a noble reason for abstaining from
the yielding to an impulse or a passion, it is better to abstain
on account of fear than not to abstain at all. Better let fear
of punishment detain from murder and from theft than to
yield to an inclination to such actions. Better let continence
be motivated by a fear for venereal diseases than to have
one yield to sexual passion which is bound to lead to misery
for self and for others.
Of course, "one who is only as good as fear will make
him is not very good. One must have higher motives to
impel to self-control."32 "Chastity must have a far more
solid foundation than fear."33 Higher than fear for dread
ful physical results is prudence. Higher than prudence is
the ethical consideration of not wanting to cause hurt to
others. Higher than ethics is the spiritual motive of wanting
to aid evolution, and not to set up new causes for ever more
misery.
Whatever motive may lead up to
it,
"the only satis
factory method of avoiding venereal disease
is
to live
a
clean
life."34 And "that one method
is
open to all."35

NEUROSES
"There is no evidence that continence
. . . produces any neurotic symp
toms."
— Foundations of Social Hygiene,i$8.
In many and sundry ways "modern civilization . . .
increases the irritation of the nervous system."1 It over-
stimulates every personal element of human nature. As a
result "neurotics represent a very large proportion of hu
manity."2 And their number seems to be rapidly increasing.
Considering that above all else the sexual nature is
being overstimulated, so that an increasing majority of man
kind is oversexed3 and ever less continent — may not the
growing percentage of neurotics have some special connec
tion with the increased neglect of chastity? Under the
spreading influence of misleading sophistries there is less
and less of what in popular speech is called repression,
more and more of expression of sex. Is it then not more
likely that the increase of cases of neurosis is caused by
undue sex expression, whether in thought or act, rather than
by so-called repression?
Yet, "psychoanalysts . . . are inclined to trace to sex
repression most of the nervous and mental disorders."4
However, "what the psychoanalyst means when he says
that psycho-neuroses are due to repression is something
very different from saying that they are due to sexual re
straint."5 Not understanding the psychoanalytical theory,
the lay public has transposed it into the fallacy that restraint
or continence tends to produce neurosis ; and this has been
taken to support the erroneous notion that sex expression
is generally advisable and even necessary.*
But "the opinion which on pseudo-psychological grounds
suggests or permits incontinence is absolutely false ... It
rests on misinterpretations, always biased and often de
liberate."7 "According to this idea the one who allows his

neurosis. But daily experience shows that he may be as
neurotic as others."8 In fact, "there are more victims of
neurasthenia among those who give free rein to their sen
suality than among those who . . . know how to escape
the yoke of mere animalism."0 And this is to be expected
since "a weakness of will with regard to sexual temptations
makes one less capable of resisting . . . nervous dis
turbances."1'
Refuting the idea that abstinence has a deleterious
effect on the nervous system is the conspicuous fact that
"there are men and women whose daily experience proves
that it is possible for even highly sexed individuals to re
main continent . . . without any abnormal psychological
effects."11
Some of "the most prominent neurologists ... do not
believe that continence leads to nervous disease."11
"Physiology and pathology clearly show that the base
of the trunk, when it has undue influence on life, works
the destruction of the whole nervous system."1' "An ab
normal condition of irritability and disorder of the sex
organs causes nervous derangement."1* But "the strictly
continent suffer little or none of that irritability"15, and
such disorder is practically unknown to them.
Where neurotic conditions are observed in continent
persons "it is not the continence which is responsible."1'
Usually "the patients . . . have become neurasthenics for
entirely different reasons, such as primary disposition, men
tal over-exertion, etc."17 However, "neurasthenia can occur
when there is antagonism between impurity of the thoughts
and purity of the body ; but that would not be a case of true
chastity."18 Any one who notwithstanding physical absti
nence "persistently indulges his sex fantasies . . . must
expect to be the victim of . . . psychological distress"1*;
for "wherever conditions arise which specially stimulate the
sexual emotions, neurasthenia may be produced."10 In such
a case "the real harm . . . comes not from the restraint of
sex desires but from . . . artificial stimulation beyond the

means of healthy control."" Hence what is to be avoided
is mental and other overstimulation of the sex impulse.
Since "continence itself never produces neurosis"", there
is no foundation for the warnings against continence which
are now not only surreptitiously but often brazenly dis
seminated.
"In healthy and not hereditarily neuropathic people
complete abstinence is possible without injury to the nervous
system."23
However, it may be true that "in individuals of neuro
pathic predisposition enforced abstinence may give rise to
danger of nervous and mental diseases"14, and that "the
more one is predisposed to neurosis the harder is sexual
abstinence."15 But since the neurotically predisposed should
particularly guard against every avoidable loss of nervous
energy, the practice of continence is especially advisable
for them. For "the continent person avoids all loss of ner
vous energy incidental to sexual excitement."1* "Every
waste of sexual power in either sex . . . lowers the nervous
tone of the entire system."17 Considerably so, because "the
nervous shock accompanying the exercise of the sexual or
gans . . . is the most profound of all to which the system
is subject."18 And especially "those who seek variations
from the normal method . . . stamp their nervous systems
with a malign influence."1*
Therefore, to save nervous energy one should be strictly
continent. For some — especially for those habituated to
sexual acts — this may seem difficult. But it is well worth
while to make the effort, because "as a result of sexual
abstinence one may acquire ... a firmness of character
which will place one beyond the reach of nerve-disturbing
influences."30 The strength of will demonstrated and forti
fied in the process of mastering the sexual impulse, is in itself
a protection against neuroses.

MEDICAL ADVICE
"The real continent individual! . . .
do not require medical help."
— Talmey, Love.Vljcn, 178.
Sex in its pathological expressions, in its disturbances and
diseases which need to be cured, is intrinsically a matter for
expert medical attention. But since "there is no pathology
in continence"1, the subject of continence does not belong
specifically to medical science. Therefore medical opinion
on this subject need not carry more weight than serious lay
opinion.
"The medical profession is made up of just as many
kinds of people as any other group."1 For this reason a
unanimous support of the ideal of continence can at no
time be expected from their side any more than from other
large groups of men. As in other humans, so in physicians
exists the danger to let personal inclination bias personal
opinion ; and this tendency is always particularly strong in
regard to sexual behavior, in which almost every person
wants to find justification for his own standard. Moreover,
the medical practitioner's constant dealing with unrepro-
ductive and abnormal sex expression of patients is apt to
obscure his vision of its ideal manifestation. And the modern
materialistic trend, with its sophistical excuses for unre
strained sexual expression, has affected the ideas on this
subject within the ranks of the medical profession as much
as amongst laymen. On account of this, definite medical
statements in support of sexual purity have become scarcer
as the years passed by.
But even if not a single medicus ever had expressed him
self in favor of continence, the ideal would not be affected.
Too many arguments apart from medical advice support
its adequacy and its evolutionary indispensability.
Even if the whole medical faculty had united in attack
ing the advisability and the feasibility of the ideal from a

physical standpoint, its absolute value would still remain
intact. For "there is something in sexual purity that is
supraphysical, something that remains inviolate and un
shaken even though its physical defenses should be
shattered."3 The spiritual value of the ideal is impervious
to physical attacks.
Be it then that medical opinion for or against continence
is not necessarily conclusive, it is yet gratifying to find that
many medici, including some of the leaders in the sexo-
logical field, have published unequivocal statements in sup
port of continence.
As already demonstrated by quotations in preceding
chapters, "reputable physicians and physiologists unite in
advocating a chaste and continent life, simply for the sake
of one's health, independently of all other considerations."4
Scores of medical writers have already been quoted; and
"the science of a thousand others . . . has affirmed that
abstinence has never caused any disturbance to health."5
"The American Medical Association has repeatedly repu
diated the false doctrine that sexual continence is incom
patible with health."6 A large English medical group has
stated that "there is no definite evidence to prove that con
tinence in either sex results in any harmful effect upon the
normal physiological activities of the organism."7
Outstanding specialists have declared that with all the
opportunity of long experience they "have no knowledge
of any harm resulting from a pure and moral life"8 ; "have
never found a man suffering from keeping himself pure"9 ;
"have never observed a single instance of atrophy of the
generative organs from this cause"10; "have never seen
diseases produced by chastity"11, and "are without proof of
their existence."11
Everywhere in the medical profession there always have
been strong supporters of the view that "the yielding to
desire is no more to be justified upon physiological or physi
cal than upon moral or religious grounds"13, and that "the
control of the sexual desire ... is necessary from the
hygienic standpoint."14 "The majority of medical authori
ties maintain that man can always retain control over the

sex urge."" Should the urge become annoying, the best
medical advice would still be that "the real remedy for
sexual distress is to remain continent."16 "A pure life is best
under all circumstances."17
Just as the opposite opinion can not be accepted as final
because it has been subscribed to by some physicians, so
"the view entertained by the most advanced medical au
thorities about the benefits of continence does not have to
be accepted on the word of any of them . . . It is a matter
capable of individual proof."18 And an individual effort to
obtain this proof will readily demonstrate that "the sub
jugation of the sexual impulse . . . develops all that is best
and noblest"19, and that "the control of this force seems to
contribute definitely ... to intellectual growth and to
spiritual development.

POPULAR OPINION
"Young people are led astray . . .
neither by temperament nor by the
lenses but by popular opinion."
— Rousseau, £mifo,H,iv,2g3.
The colorless expression of immature minds which are
deluded by warped echos of half-truths — that's popular
opinion. It covers the earth as though with a layer of viscid
paste which glues most of humanity down to a common,
very common level. Devoid of depth, despoiled of elevation,
it is in one word shallow.
Whoever pulls himself loose from the confining ad
herence to popular opinion and rises morally and spiritually
above the surrounding group, is scoffed and ridiculed. This
has always been the fate of those who aspired to realities
within instead of reaching like most of the others for un
realities without. Always "the wisdom lover is rebuked by
the many as though he were beside himself."1 Always "men
are attacked for seeking perfection."* And if they try to tell
the others that greater things can be acquired by a renounc
ing of the lesser, "they're hated and despised."3 Always
"men seek to vilify . . . whoever teaches them to discipline
the senses in order that their higher nature may appear"4,
"and he escapes with rare good fortune if his chastity or his
virility is not assailed."5
What else can be expected when "the mass of men . . .
are so prone to lust that they cannot delight in any pleasure
save such as they receive from bodily sensations."6 In the
world in which we live, when one is seen rejecting these
physical sensations for the sake of spiritual realization, it is
the usual thing that "the rest are of opinion that to him who
has no part in bodily pleasure life is not worth living."'
However, "in matters where strong desires and lusts are
concerned the majority ... is usually wrong."8 In their
opinion on such matters most people are misled by their own

sensual attractions. And "turning all their thoughts and
desires towards transitory things . . . they know nothing
of the inner life"9, which the one who separates himself
from the masses strives to reach.
The majority, limited in vision to material interests, can
not possibly understand spiritual motives. "Neither the
spiritual man nor spiritual things can be judged by the car
nal mind"10, which shapes the fallacies of popular opinion.
But "as it is not for those to speak of graceful forms of the
material world who have never seen them, so those should
be silent . . . who have never known the face of Moral
Wisdom, beautiful beyond the beauty of evening and of
dawn.""
Those who have had a glimpse of spiritual beauty will
agree that "it is the province only of the stupid to pay atten
tion to the opinion of the multitude."12 For when, either
from mental lassitude or in order not to be unpopular, one
lets himself be held back by popular opinion from climbing
spiritual heights, one never gets above the common plains.
Of course "it is much easier to go with the majority than
to climb, painfully and slowly, to the heights of isolation"1',
which have remained free from the profaning influence of
the multitudes. Yet it is only on these heights that one can
enjoy a wider outlook, breathe purer air, hear whisperings
of spirit and conceive its wisdom.

XXXIX
ASCETICISM
"My highest respect to the ascetic
ideal in so far as it is honest."
— Nietzsche, Genealogy of Morals,
111,26.
In an unspoiled state, and again in a purified state, man is
naturally ascetic in the sense of being abstemious, of leaving
off whatever only serves to satisfy unnaturally stimulated,
desire-created cravings. In the unspoiled such cravings do
not yet exist, in the purified they have been overcome.
Between these two evolutionary conditions lies the inter
mediate one in which most of humanity now finds itself.
By misusing the mind to overstimulate the body-impulses
man has abandoned the primitive, more innocent state. By
clinging to sense-gratification he hinders his attainment of
the higher, spiritualized condition.
In the present deadlock of human evolution1 mankind
chooses ignorantly or stubbornly to follow the dictates of
bodily desires. Those however who are anxious to hasten
evolution must inevitably free themselves from the domina
tion of such desires ; and for this purpose the need of ascetic
exercises — more or less drastic and rigid according to one's
individual propensities — is undeniable.
In many ways "asceticism and chastity . . . are useful
means to desirable ends."1 "An ascetic element is insepar
able from all morality."3 It "is an absolutely indispensable
means for the attainment of moral freedom, especially in
the sphere of sex."4 For "only asceticism can free us from the
yoke of our passions, and lead us to the highest goal of mo
rality."5 But also "those who want to conquer real know
ledge have to . . . submit themselves to a kind of asceti
cism."6 Through regular exercise the mind must be freed
from the influence of the senses in order to be able to func
tion to its fullest capacity.7 In every way "asceticism . . .
leads to a fuller life."8 And finally "by means of ascetic ob

servances man becomes ... a spiritual being."* In no
other way can those racial habits which render the body
unserviceable as an organ of the spirit be overcome.10
The real purpose of asceticism is to remove the noxious
weeds of physical indulgence in order to make room for
valuable spiritual growth. So considered "the ascetic ideal
has an element of eternal truth without which life can have
no true culture."11 For first of all "asceticism is a discipline
in self-control ... It helps to fortify the character and the
will."11 "It is a discipline of mind and body to fit men for
the service of an ideal. Its purpose is to harden as well as
to purify"1', "to secure control over the appetites . . . and
to bring the body into subjection to the will."14
It is unfortunate that many a fanatical ascetic has spe
cialized in exaggerated, morbid and repellent austerities, as
though one could acquire a spiritual asset by outdoing others
in self-torture, or as though preparatory exercises themselves
constituted the sought-for end !
Such ascetical extremists may well have succeeded "by
inflicting any smart to overthrow the strongest passion by
the most violent pain"14, on the same principle that is ap
plied in the modern medical method of counter-irritation.
But by so cruelly crushing the lower side of life they fre
quently have crippled the physical body which, after all, is
the vehicle through which man's higher faculties also must
find expression.
Apart from this unwarranted application of ascetic prin
ciples "there is a sane and civilized asceticism which presents
a quite different face."1' It holds that "the ascetic is not he
who punishes the body but who purifies the soul"17, at the
same time that he disciplines and refines the body to bring
it into vibratory harmony with spirit. This moderate and
sensible asceticism emphasizes that its self-denying practices
are only a contributory factor in inducing a spiritual result,
and that they must be combined with the practical exercise
of spiritual qualities. "The sane ascetic strives to coordinate
his personality, to unify his powers ... by subordinating
the lower to the higher ; and where he represses it is with a
view to development and enrichment."18

Indeed, "the creed of the ascetic . . . has a real and vi
tal meaning."19 "His voluntary celibacy and abstinence
. . . place at his disposal all that force which would be dis
charged by a man of the world ... in domestic affection"10
and in worldly pleasures and excitements.
If evolution is to proceed without an interrupting retro
gression, "asceticism . . . will have to be recognized as a
basic thing in human nature"" — even though in many it
be deeply buried under layers of sense-feeding soil.
"In the ascetic movements . . . there was an equally
vital and important truth, which will have to be rehabilita
ted."1* That truth involves the fact that spiritual power can
not manifest where there is moral weakness; and that
"whatever is given to the body is taken from the spirit."1*
Hence "the principle of true asceticism is the principle of
spiritual self-preservation."14

THE MODERN ASCETIC
"Our day has created a new ascetic
type . . . one finds him almost every
where."
— Bjerre, Remaking of Marriage,
vii.ioo.
Enters : the modern ascetic.
Not an emaciated sitter-under-a-tree is he, as so many
of his Oriental brothers. He is neither dolorously pious like
the early Christian or the standardized medieval type, nor
long-faced and gloomy like the Puritan blue-lawmaker is
commonly represented to be. He is not mirthlessly narrow-
minded, not solemnly condemning, not unctuously upbraid
ing others with a self-satisfied sham of superiority. Nor is he
trying to force his ways or his convictions on his fellowmen.
On the contrary, he is a cheerful, radiant person, happy
in the spiritual felicity that is his; unostentatiously and
unassumingly going his way ; strict for himself in trying to
apply the spiritual principles in every-day existence, while
broadmindedly understanding that others, from different
standpoints, will view things differently. Seeing as he does
in savage and sage a manifestation of the All, he feels in
spirit oneness with all.
People may call him meek because he is not aggressive,
nor self-assertive, nor greedy, and because in his recognition
of the one life in whatever physical form it may manifest he
is no fighter, no killer, and will even "choose rather to be
strong in soul than in body."1 His meekness is not a sign
of weakness : it is the expression of positive spiritual strength.
Life might be easier for him if he went into solitude.
But permanent solitude befits either the weaklings who seek
protection against the hurts and hazards of worldly trials
and temptations, or it belongs to those who have grown
spiritually so strong as not to need the stimulating whip of
worldly dilemmas any more. It is just for developing this

strength in regular exercise and against unremitting opposi
tion that the modern ascetic is living in the midst of a ma
terialistic world.
Instead of living solitarily he seeks solidarity. He tries
in a way "to lead the monastic life while remaining in the
world . . . seeking not to detach himself from his fellow-
men, but only from earthly gratification."1 He attempts not
to escape but to conquer all those forces which are antitheti
cal to his growing spiritual strength. "He is a man in the
world, but he . . . will raise himself entirely above it."3
"When such a one after many struggles with his own nature
has finally conquered ... he looks on the delusions of the
world smiling and at rest."4
The modern ascetic seeks to approach an ideal. And
whatever would deflect him from that ideal, whatever he
recognizes as an obstacle between himself and the ideal, he
unhesitatingly discards. Training his body as an instrument
for spirit he is truly an ascetic, realizing that "asceticism is
the necessary ante-chamber to spiritual perfection."5 While
in that ante-chamber, he has to drop the non-essentials be
fore he can be admitted into the sanctum.
He knows that the senses, more than aught else, try to
delude and draw him into potentially obstructive interests
and actions" ; therefore he sedulously refrains from active
part in all that would tend to reinforce the possible remnant
of a sensual element in his nature. He is one "in whom the
better consciousness is so continuously active that it . . .
never allows his passions to get a hold of him."7 In most
cases "he does not beget children of his own flesh, but brings
to birth the children of his spirit"8 — be it sometimes in no
more visible form than that of elevating thoughts.
The more clearly the outline of the ideal rises before him,
the more readily does all sense and specially sex-allurement
lose its attraction for him. Many people, "failing to recog
nize the joy of ascendancy"9 of the ascetic, think that he is
painfully sacrificing what they hold to be life's pleasures.
But they do not know "that clean strong feeling of freedom
which surges over him when he has resisted the lure of some
bodily appetite."10 He does not really have to sacrifice any

one does not want"11 — and this certainly excludes any idea
of sacrifice. Eventually, when nothing remains in him that
can respond to lower vibrations, all temptation naturally
falls away from him.
No, not a suffering martyr is the modern ascetic ! He has

sensual pleasure, is partly his already.

XLI
PERFECT CELIBACY
"The world over, celibacy it the key
... to the higher spheres of life."
—Dahlke, Marriage as a Fetler^oy.
Higher than the most continent life, which perchance
still shares in the propagation of the race, is perfect celibacy.
It lies above the realm of sex, and beyond the reach of all
sensual influences. "The attainment of the loftiest condi
tion of existence has at all times and by all races been sought
through celibacy."1
The nominal celibacy of those who just happen to re
main unmarried or of others who are celibates under com
pulsion without inner conviction — that of course is not suf
ficient for high spiritual results. True and perfect celibacy
is required, such as those who for selfish reasons or entirely
against their wishes remain single hardly ever practise, even
if they do abstain from intercourse and other sexual acts.
Perfect celibacy is also far from those who abstain on ac
count of fear, or because of impotence or other pathological
conditions. In these cases abstinence "is no better than that
of eunuchs ... a mere privation, without excellency."1
Mere abstinence from physical sexual acts does not es
tablish perfect celibacy. Not until the mind itself is freed
from sexual disturbances and longings — not until "celibacy
is the expression of the striving after an ideal state"8, or is
self-willed and freely chosen for the sake of a lofty pur
pose — can there be a question of perfect celibacy.
"The real test of the efficacy of celibacy must be whether
or not the celibate actually overcomes not merely physical
impulse but all consciousness of sex differences."4 No one
considers it unnatural to rise above these differences in in
tellectual contacts. In spiritual companionship — and gen
erally at an advanced evolutionary stage — it is even more
essential to have risen entirely above every attraction of
sex.

i44 The Coiled Serpent
In a few cases the soul does not consciously have to
choose or will to free itself, but seems to be born free from
sex attraction, free from sensual tendencies, with a natural
inclination towards the perfect celibate life. This stage of
spiritual-evolutionary growth has not only been demonstra
ted in the prominent but exceptional examples of saint and
saviorship ; it is also frequently found in inconspicuous per
sons who, in whatever circumstances they are placed, are
radiating centers of purity.
The hypothesis that the incarnating soul has pre-existed,
and has evolved by its own efforts in other lives5, is pro
bably the only one that can explain how in every instance,
even when inborn, "perfect celibacy ... is a result of the
victory of the spirit over the body."*

XLII
RACE SUICIDE ?
"The idea that the teaching of sexual
abstinence . . . may prematurely stop
the propagation of the human race
is absurd."
— Solovyof, Justification of the
Good,I^i,54
"Let some one hint at the necessity of our curbing our pas
sions, and immediately the cry is raised that the human race
is in danger."1 "As if any one, in surrendering to the desire
of the flesh, had ever thought of safeguarding thereby the
future of humanity!"1 And as though those who indulge in
sex do not intentionally prevent issue most of the time !
But there need be no fear. "Nature takes pretty good
care ... of her racial purposes.'" "So long as the succes
sion of generations is necessary for the development of the
human species the taste for bringing that succession about
will certainly not disappear in man"4 — that is, not in all
men.
The ideal of purification of the sexual life holds not the
slightest danger for the continuation of the race. For this
ideal, as applicable to the majority of mankind,
is
not that
reproduction should be stopped, but that sex should be used
for reproduction only. This certainly does not entail race
suicide
!
It
does not threaten the existence of the race, but
only that of animal-man
;
and in the course of evolution he
will have to disappear, just as the prehistoric animals have
been extinguished. In the records of the future spiritual hu
man race the present animal-man will only vaguely be re
membered as
a
kind of semi-human animal which long be
fore that time shall have passed out of existence.
No danger
is
entailed by the fact that always there are
a
few who, in dedication to spiritual ends, wish to and can
entirely rise above animality and above sex. For these the
ideal transcends the boundaries of sex and excludes their
sharing in the propagation of the race. But as long as they

146 The Coiled Serpent
are few they do not in the least endanger the existence of
humanity; for it is never requisite that every one shall
breed, as little as that all need till the soil in order to feed
the race.
A danger might be seen in the far-off possibility that
those who entirely abstain from sex become so numerous as
to form the great majority. But even then
If perfect celibacy were chosen by the many for the sake
of spiritual evolution, this would indicate that the larger
portion of the race had reached a stage above that of ani
mal-man. Should nature find that it was then becoming
unpractical to continue the human species by the sexual
method, she can be trusted to institute a new reproductive
system in which sex plays no part.5 Thus "the moment when
all men will finally overcome the fleshly lust and become
entirely chaste . . . will be the end of the historical pro
cess"6 — not necessarily the end of the human race.
It may well be, however, that attainment of the fully
spiritualized stage will bring mankind to the point where
it can step out of the human into a higher evolutionary
kingdom. That would bring about the end of humanity as
such. Not by suicide, but by what may be called its natural
death — death in the same sense as graduation from school
may be called the death of the 'pupil' who thereafter, in a
higher institution of learning, becomes a 'student'.
Suicidal to the race is the customary abuse of sex, be
cause it threatens humanity with an untimely death from
self-inflicted diseases.7 If mankind adheres to its present sex
ual behavior "it is likely ... to perish by the various vi
cious abuses and excesses which it has used the powers of
its superior reason to devise and indulge."8 It threatens to
degenerate and to destroy itself by an abuse of the very
element by which it was intended to maintain and, by
transmutation, to regenerate itself.
There can be no question of racial suicide when human
ity rises spiritually, and thereby rises above sex — and when,
after attaining every purpose of human existence, it leaves
the human for the supermannic life.9

XLIII
WOMAN TOO !
"The demand for sexual abstinence
on the part of both sexes is put for
ward with good reason."
— Weininoer, Sex and Character,
II,xiv,345.
Man and woman are basically alike.
Although differing anatomically and physiologically,
their bodies are but incidental variations of one fundamen
tal form, as is indicated by the presence of vestigial organs
in each. "Even the primary reproductive organs of each are
in all their parts represented in the opposite sex."1 And "the
secondary characteristics of each lie dormant in the oppo
site sex."
Apart from the body, and especially in latent spiritual
possibilities, "man and woman are . . . perfectly equal one
with the other."3 "From the spiritual point of view there is
no difference between woman and man."4 "The psycholo
gical trends that appear in men and in women . . . are not
specifically masculine or feminine."5 "There is no pure mas
culinity or femininity ... in the psychological sense.'"
"Every individual contains both in many aspects."7 "Both
sexes are represented in every individual."8 And "in the per
fect man . . . eternal femininity and eternal masculinity
come into contact with one another"9 in perfect balance.
Apparent dissimilarities in traits of character and of
mind have been caused by the differing influences to which
men and women have been exposed through countless ages.
In personal ways of expression men acquired all that man
liness implies, and women became what is now considered
to be womanly, on account of the specific social rules under
which each of the sexes evolved. "Men were standardized
in accordance with the accepted masculine model, and wo
men were moulded to conform with the prevailing canons
of femininity."10

Woman Too! 149
Sexually man and woman both are essentially and nat
urally pure. In this respect "it may be held that there is no
difference at all."11 But due to the fact that woman has been
more shielded from sexually stimulating factors, she has
generally manifested less sensuality — and, as a result, more
spirituality — than man. In women "sexual feeling is in the
majority of cases in abeyance and requires considerable ex
citement to be roused at all."11 "In . . . not artificially
stimulated women the libido is considerably weaker than it
is in men."1'
Although there are exceptions, there can be no doubt
that "the normal sexual sentiment of woman is developed
—
in the direction of ... a longing for children."14 For this,
when not for love's sake or for gain, she has endured man's
passion, almost invariably in dispassionate surrender.
Originally for the sake of maternity woman has focussed
her attention on attracting and pleasing the male. So in
tense has been this effort to attract him that from a means it
has become an end in itself, while the racial purpose behind
it has been neglected and has become nearly obsolete. And
while concentrating on man's physical demands woman has
retarded her further spiritual unfoldment.
Still, woman is generally in spirituality superior to man.
And "morally the general superiority of woman over man
... is unquestionable."13 She can retain this twofold su
periority as long as she does not begin to yearn for and to in
dulge in sense-gratification.
But in recent times many women have been led to regard
sexual expression as a symbol of new freedom and to desire
it as a supposed mode of self-expression. They might change
their modern viewpoint if they but knew that they have been
led to their new attitude by a treacherous ruse of man!
"Modern woman's magna charta was written by . . .
man."16 "Under male debauched inspiration modern eman
cipated woman has extended the bounds of feminism.""
When woman began to assert her right to physical and
social independence and to break the thraldom of her sex,
man saw the imminent danger of his loss of power over her.
He came "to a conscious or subconscious realization that the

increasing intelligence of woman was removing from his
grasp those superficial, shallower female ministrations which
he desires."18 Having to reckon with her growing mental
faculties he had to find new means of inveigling her into a
continued compliance to his desires.
And so, through screen and stage and print he has as
sailed "the more dignified attitude of woman towards sex."1*
He has made morality seem ridiculous, faithfulness foolish,
chastity a superstition, sex a compelling power. And by en
couraging in her the use of the same stimulating factors that
have overexcited him — including nicotine and alcoholic
drinks — he has made her more receptive to the suggestion
that his grosser desires are also hers.
"In his own interests man has invented various doctrines
which he has persuaded many women to believe."10 One of
these man-made doctrines is a new system of psychology
which inculcates the idea that health and happiness can only
be attained by giving free rein to supposedly natural im
pulses. Through this ultra-modern psycho-sophistry he has
threatened her with imaginary dangers of neuroses", of
sickliness and wretchedness, if she does not yield to his amo
rous entreaties.
And, too, he has pretended to encourage her in her de
mand for equal rights with him. He has suggested that she
as well as he shall have the right to live and love. And what
is meant by this suggestion
is,
plainly, that she too seek sex
ual experiences — probatively, promiscuously, and prophy-
lactically, but above all not propagatively
!
So specious and confusing have been man's methods of
persuasion that woman has often been convinced. Undoubt
edly, in the end she "will discover, through the painful
method of trial and error, that the fewer her sex experi
ments the greater her ultimate well-being"", spiritually as
well as physically. Meantime, instead of lifting man to her
own purer, higher level, she
is
descending toward his.
Therefore an exhortation to sexual purity
is
now not be
ing written for men only, but for women too — for those at
least who value health and happiness,
if
not for themselves
then for the sake of the children which may be theirs
;
and
especially for those who value spiritual growth.

The process of spiritualization is the same for woman

XLIV
A SINGLE STANDARD
"The double standard of moral] . . .
u wholly indefeniible from the bio
logical at from every other point of
view."
—Popenoe, Problems of Reproduc
tion^,15.
Patriarchy and matriarchy each has occasionally pre
vailed in the course of evolution. Now the males, then the
females have been dominant. Whenever either of the two
sexes has wielded dictatorial authority, it has established a
double standard of morals : one of license for itself, and one
of inhibition for the subordinate sex.1
Because for many ages male rule has been supreme
"much of our feeling on this subject is due to laws and moral
systems which were formed by men, and were in the first
place intended to shield them' and their libertinism. Under
the moral code that was contrived by men "women have
been regarded as inferior creatures. And they have content
edly accepted the status assigned to them. They have . . .
failed to resent masculine immorality."* But in the ascen
dancy of their emancipation women begin to realize that
"duplex sexual morality is an ethic of injustice, of mendacity
and ... of hypocrisy"4, and that "it is . . . the acme of
immorality."5
By the disenthralment of womanhood from sexual bon
dage "the double standard of sex ethics is . . . doomed.'"
"One standard of morality must be established for men and
women."7 The question is which standard is to be adopted.
"Women may be granted like sexual freedoms to those
which men possess, or the rigid canons of sexual behavior
which are already imposed upon women may be imposed
upon men also. Both these trends are conspicuously in evi
dence today."8
If woman insists on stepping into the ways of man, com
plete racial degeneration will undoubtedly follow. For she

supplies almost entirely the elements out of which the suc
ceeding generation is formed. The chastity of the mothers
of the race in the past has helped to at least partly offset the
damaging results of male unchastity, and has so far preven
ted the complete breakdown of the race.
Only if man adopts the chastity which used to be so
highly praised in woman, regeneration of the race will be
come possible.
In the period of transition from the double standard to a
single, symptoms of lack of balance and of flagrant extremes
are bound to manifest. Every revolutionary movement drives
a large contingent of the emotional and of the ignorant to
indiscriminate, impassioned, ruinous acts.
The successful revolt of woman for emancipation has
been helpful in the approach to a single standard. But in
many cases "women's new freedom is a rather smudgy car
bon copy of man's petty vices."9 Too often the demanded
"equality . . . has become equality in lust and passion.
Emancipation has grown into licentiousness."10
If women want to perfect their emancipation they will
have to "impose their higher standards on men, rather than
accept the lower standards . . . which they rightly used to
deprecate in men."11 For the sake of woman's cause there
is a need of "a woman-made code of sex morality on which
the women of the future will act for their own protection
and for the protection of children — and on which they will
therefore require men to act."1* "The task will
'
assuredly
not be accomplished by women copying men's sexual soul-
lessness"13, but by "the rule of chastity . . . becoming gen
erally enforced in practice through the refusal of women
to be parties to its violation."14
In the end "the double standard of sex morality . . .
can be removed not by the revolt of woman but by the re
straint of man."15 When a lasting and uplifting single stan
dard is established "the morality of men will be judged by
the same standard as the morality of women."1' "Men will
be forced to place a curb upon their passions and learn to
exercise control."" "Ultimately chastity will be the ideal for
men as well as for women."18

154 The Coiled Serpent
Man must be made to see that "the woman's cause is
man's ; they rise or sink together, dwarfed or godlike, bond
or free."19 He should understand that "in delivering her he
also delivers himself."10 And in order to deliver her "he must
free himself of sex, for in that way only can he free woman.
In his purity . . . lies her salvation."11
The most valid reason why man should not be inferior
to woman in sexual purity is that "the racial interest re
quires from him the same strict chastity as from the wo
man."12 "Strict female chastity was originally demanded in
the interest of posterity . . . The interest of posterity re
quires the same strict chastity in the man"" ; in him it ex
acts "the great chastity of paternity, to match the great
chastity of maternity."14
A logical, ethical, noble single standard must necessarily
be one of strict chastity for all.
The single standard can never be one of equal rights.
Rights are too often conflicting. Rights can only be upheld
at the cost of inequality. The ideal single standard will have
to be one of equal duties, of equally shared racial responsi
bility, rather than of equal rights.
As long as physiological differences between the sexes
exist there can be no perfect sexual equality. But there can
be and there must be for male and female equally a perfect
liberty not of but from sexual expression, except in dedicated
loving service to the race. By accepting this standard of li
berty for herself, and by enjoining it upon man, woman can
finally and gloriously win her real emancipation.
Adoption of the single standard of equal purity will auto
matically bring about not only woman's social and mental,
and man's moral emancipation, but also the spiritual eman
cipation of both,

XLV
FREEDOM
"We are not free agents 10 long at
we are on the rack of lex."
— Comfort, Public Square,xxvw,iy6.
The members of the younger generation are in open moral
revolt — not quite without some justifiable reasons. They
have discovered the undeniable fact that their predecessors
and preceptors have run the business of life unto the brink
of ruin; that bombastic and dogmatic sham and bigotry
have begun to characterize the rules by which that business
is conducted; and that under the polished surface of the
structure in which life's business is carried on, dry-rot from
pretense, prudery, cant and hypocrisy has developed. "The
elders who for so long have been the sacred guardians of
civilization have bungled their task abominably."1 As a re
sult the young people have an inkling that once precious as
sets have been squandered or neglected, so that little of value
seems to be left over for the succeeding generation.
The pity however is that they are trying to take charge
before having acquired the necessary preparatory knowledge
and the ability to do better than their elders. What they
desire is freedom in their own ways of running life — al
though their own ways, proper, are decidedly improper.
Blind are they to the fact that "life is more than a childish
having our own way, than an indulgence of our whims
and passions."* "It is not merely a list of opportunities for
self-satisfaction but a set of obligations for realizing spiritual
good."3 "Life is not made happy ... by getting what we
happen to want"4, neither by wantonness, but by seeking
what can make us lastingly happy.
Young people overlook the fact that liberty does not con
sist in taking liberties, nor in libertinism. They seem quite
unaware that "freedom must be won ... by an incalcu
lable discipline of the intellectual and moral powers'" ; that
only "he is free . . . who has controlled his passion'" ; and

that we can know no freedom so long as we are slaves of the
senses. We only reach "absolute liberty . . . when we have
the greatest authority over ourselves."7
Freedom from all restraint is what modern youth is
fighting for — forgetting that "it is restraint which charac
terizes the higher creature and betters the lower."8 Any
"constraint put upon impulse, desire, passion, and any lim
itation of caprice and self-will is regarded as a fettering of
freedom.'" But "we should look upon such limitation as the
indispensable proviso of emancipation"10, instead of adher
ing to "that false and misleading doctrine of freedom which
encourages our lower inclinations to run riot while allowing
our higher nature to pass into decay."11
"The desire for freedom . . . may become a source of
antagonism to culture""; and such so-called "freedom
... is liable to become the occasion for all imaginable ex
cesses."13 It is under the influence of false teachings about
freedom that in impassioned frenzy the rampageous revolt-
ers tear down whatever they consider an obstruction: bar
riers of decency, pillars of man-made laws, and warning
signposts of the wisdom of the ages. Finally they crash into,
and meet disaster for themselves in venturing to break up,
the adamantine monuments of nature's own great laws.
As in all previous premature revolts of untrained rebels
the feasting and ravaging will go on until all are exhausted,
their vital energies spent. Either they will wake up and
realize their errors, or the task of clearing up the ruins will
fall upon another generation.
Intact under the ruins will then be found the long dis
carded treasure that has been known and remembered al
ways by just a very few: the treasure metaphorically con
sisting of the indestructible tablets on which are inscribed
the manifestos of eternal spiritual laws.
Only by studying those laws and by living in accordance,
by becoming all at-one with them can freedom be attained.
By "asserting once more the dominion of spirit over matter
and of spiritual freedom over animal slavery"15, "the soul
. . . learns that in the life of the spirit only is true fib-
erty.

CRIME
"The greatest cause of crimes is lust."
— Plato, Laws.IXfiyo.
"Crime as determined by passion is forced upon the atten
tion of moralist and magistrate by the large number of
active and passive victims for which it is responsible."1
"Sexual immorality ... is a most prolific source of
crimes."1 Definitely "sexual crimes are amongst the saddest
phenomena of modern criminality"1; everywhere "court
dockets bear out the tale with murders for lust . . . and
other crimes of jealousy and perversion."4 And indirectly,
too, in a more general sense "the viciousness and crime so
prevalent in this day are the logical harvest springing out of
the unnatural sex relations of our artificial civilization."8
Considering that by far most of humanity's sexual acts are
inherently unnatural and perverse", it is no wonder that the
harvest in the form of crime is steadily increasing.
"With both men and women sex as an immediate exci
tant to crime is acknowledged to serve in much the same way
as alcohol serves as an excitant to sex interest."7 Stirred be
yond control, "the fire of sexual lust . . . kindles every
species of wantonness."8 "There is no criminal purpose and
no evil deed which the lust for carnal pleasure will not drive
a person to undertake."9
Already in adolescent delinquency a strong connection
between sensuality and crime is evident. "The criminal hab
it commences in most young people . . . with illicit sex
ual indulgence."10 And experts have found "sexual precocity
characteristic of young criminals."11
All this adds force to the conclusion to which philoso
phers have come, namely that "the lust for sexual excite
ment is the greatest ill of all"1*, and that "concupiscence is
the root of all evil."13 What humanity has made of the sex
ual urge by abuse and overstimulation undoubtedly consti

tutes the basic origin of most of the misery that oppresses
mankind.14 Were concupiscence brought back within the
limits of its natural purpose of racial preservation, there
would be far less crime, because the greatest incentive would
be lacking.
Certainly, "it is time that law enforcement gave more
attention to the close correlation of sex and crime."15
Most people, of course, feel themselves far beyond the
possibility of committing or of being accessories to the com
mitment of any crime. Yet, few are entirely free from shar
ing in the guilt of those who perpetrate sexual crimes. Part
of the guilt falls on all who foster erotic thoughts and cher
ish passional emotions.
It has become a platitude to say that thoughts are
things ; and hardly any one seems to take it very seriously
that also "passional emotions create ... a variety of
thought-forms."1* Yet it seems only logical thai every little
thought or emotion sends out a vibratory wave which links
up with others of its own nature. They reinforce each other
until "very powerful blocks of emotion-forms are floating
about . . . and a person may readily be influenced by
them."17
Thus it appears to be literally true that "sensuality . . .
hangs over humanity like a heavy funereal pall"18, which is
"ready at any moment to pounce on the unwary and inject
its poison into their emotional organism."" All who are re
ceptive — the young, the weak of character, the sensually
sensitive, the criminally inclined — they all are dangerously
exposed to the influence of the accumulated terrible
thought-forms to which many a self-righteous person has
contributed a far from negligible share.
In essence the merest erotic thinking is apt to contribute
to somebody's criminal delinquency — which makes the
thinker of sensual thoughts an instigator of crime. Consid
ering this, one may well come to the conclusion that, in so
far as moral responsibility is concerned, "it is one of the
greatest crimes to indulge in sexual sensuality.""

XLVII
THE ALTRUISM OF ETHICS
"As an ethical being man ii naturally
superior to passion."
— Keyserlino, Book of Marriage,
111,303.
The foundation of ethics is others-mindedness.
Though often considered to be the equivalent of moral
ity, ethics is strictly only that part of applied morality which
in every act shows due consideration of others. It is the re
sult of a recognition that each is but an integral part of the
whole, and that therefore the true interests of others are
identical with one's own. It is an expression, though as a rule
an unconscious one, of the inner spiritual knowledge of the
oneness of all life.1
If humanity is to build a better world out of the present
conditions, "the ideal that regulates the new world must be
an ethical one."* And in order to be truly ethical it must
be altruistic, it must in every action give foremost considera
tion to the well-being of others ; "its final test must be the
total welfare and progress of society."3
Along with the application of ethical principles in other
fields "a new and better sexual ethic is indispensable.'" It,
too, must be based on the interests of others, and this can
be attained in one way only: "the sexual impulse must be
subordinated to the welfare of society . . . through the
cultivation of inhibition."5 Therefore "increasing inhibition
of the lower centers by the higher and diminishing sexual
passion must play a strong part in determining conduct in
the future."" Thus alone can ethics become manifest in
the sexual life of mankind. "Any so-called ethics which
does not recognize the necessity of putting restraint upon
naive desire is inherently absurd."7
After all, in the sexual domain as in every other field
the true interests of the individual and of the race are
identical. For "if man controls his desires for the sake of

The Altruism of Ethics
higher social motives, he himself rises in the scale of being."8
A consistent practice of inhibition of the sex impulse for
ethical reasons leads toward individual and social evolution
ary perfection at the same time. "If we all so ordered our
conduct that it should be in harmony with the destiny of
mankind, the highest perfection would be attained."* To
approach this ideal state "each must make such a contribu
tion of his own that if all contributed similarly the result
would be perfection."10
But whenever a sensual impulse is permitted to influence
thoughts and acts ethics is forgotten. Then "the singular
violence of amorous passion . . . can lead to forgetfulness
of the most sacred duties."11 "All the indecencies of life
have arisen as a result of this."11 At such times even the
idealistically inclined often "do not find it necessary to in
troduce higher ideals into their lives."13
To be effective under all circumstances ethics must be
based on "a view of life which emphasizes the spiritual
power of man over mere impulse ... a view in which the
spiritual element is cultivated and practised."14
The popular idea that sexual behavior is exclusively
one's private affair is antagonistic to the very principle of
ethics.
Every sexual act touches the interests of society and of
the race. Even whether or not directly harming another
person, even whether or not fomenting and spreading
disease, sexual activity is always intrinsically not just one's
own but a racial affair. When the act is purely propagative
the interests of the individual to be born — and thereby of
coming generations — are evidently involved. In every
other case sexual activity, in whatever form it may manifest,
is an expression of sensual self-gratification and as such is
detrimental to the race. "Every individual . . . who claims
the liberty to use the reproductive energy merely for his
own pleasure spreads in society the germs of disorder."15
For "a terrible interrelation joins that supposed private
action to the most distant events in the social life."1*
To divert the generative power into channels for per
sonal gratification is detrimental to the race for this reason

also that it interferes with the spiritual development of the
acting individual.17 Humanity can advance in its evolution
only if the separate units progress. Hence to impede in
dividual evolution in effect hampers the evolution of human
ity. On this basis, too, sexual behavior proves to be by no
means only one's private affair, but a matter of racial
importance.
For all these reasons every sexual act that is devoid of
propagative intention, being inconsiderate of the best
interests of humanity, is preeminently lacking in altruism
and is unethical. If we want to be ethical "our duty towards
ourselves and the interest of humanity demand that we
should have no passion."18 Many may consider this an
extremist's view. But "ethics insists on the extreme."1'
"It is a hard ethic, you say . . . But only so can we
cease to be beasts and begin to be gods."10

XLVIII
SUPREME MORALITY
"The moral law . . . must be the ex
pression of supreme purity."
— Kant, Lectures on Ethics,66.
Changing with times and climes moral codes have fluctu
ated like fashions, customs and conventions. But all these
varying, arbitrary and relatively moral codes have made
allowances for human shortcomings and limitations. They
are merely distant semblances of an absolute, unvarying
standard.
There is a universal moral law, as universal and im
mutable as that of gravitation. "It contains the standard
of moral perfection."1 Only "if the foundation of our
actions is that they shall be consistent with the universal
rule, which is valid at all times and for every one, then our
conduct has its source in the principle of true morality.'"
The absolute moral law is for eternity engraved in the
scrolls of spirit — not as an imposed command, but as a
statement of facts in nature. To have access to these scrolls
one must needs be spiritually evolved. Those who had
reached that stage have always demonstrated the absolute
moral law in their own lives ; and many of them have tried
to render the canons of this law in as simple, lucid terms as
human language permits, in order that others might know
the way to spiritual attainment.
Based on nature's immutable laws "the principles of
morality are axioms like those of geometry."3 These moral
axioms can be condensed into one phrase: the need of
purification, leading to faultless purity.
In order to advance in harmony with evolution, and
to grow spiritually, it is necessary to follow the principles
of supreme morality in every respect. But in the realm of
sex particularly great stress must be laid on the necessity
of purification "because the spiritual in us is so overborne,
so overweighted by the animal."4

The Coiled Serpent
"The human constitution as it exists today . . . con
taining a large animal element, cannot furnish the basis
of rational morality."5 Therefore, in practice "morality
should be based not on human nature in its existing vitiated
condition, but on human nature, ideal, as it may be in the
future.'"
Essentially "the moral task of man is spiritualization."7
To be effective, "morality must work so . . . that in every
thing the realm of the spirit may be increased"8, because in
that direction lies the evolutionary perfectability of human
nature. "While striving after morality we are at the same
time battling for our own spiritual self", for "a complete
self-consciousness of the spiritual life is attained first in
morality"10, in a morality far above the common standard.
No dabbling in half-way measures, which cater to personal
deficiencies, can bring results.
Unavoidably, in order to become spiritual, man must
unfailingly apply the absolute moral law, for the truly
"spiritual man cannot be ... an immoral man ; if he were
he would kill his spiritual life."11
Until spirituality has been gained, "life is a never
ceasing duel between the animal impulse and morality."11
A heavy struggle sometimes. But "any system of morality
which accommodates itself to what is easy for man to do
corrupts the perfection of humanity."1*
Even for every-day existence "the moral law must be
. . . the law in obedience to which perfection consists."14
"If there is to be any moral progress the lower must be
forced to give way to the higher."15 "The moral principle
. . . contradicts the passions and serves to check them.""
"With regard to the corporeal life our moral task consists
in not being passively determined by fleshly desires.""
"Morality . . . demands actual struggle with the flesh."1*
All such statements as just quoted are not arbitrarily
conceived. They are only the practical expression of
absolute moral law. Every breaking of that law — in other
words : every act that is not perfectly pure — is spiritual
suicide.

XLIX
LAWS
"The supreme Law can be known
only . . . when the ego has disen
tangled itself from the enticements of
sex."
— Minole, Science of Lov4paiit$ai.
"We are all held fast and guided, not only in our physical
but also our moral lives, by immutable Laws."1 Law rules
the universe. Macrocosm and microcosm, the invisible and
the visible, the spiritual and the material worlds are
definitely bound by nature's all-embracing Laws.
In the lower kingdoms natural Law rules unprotested.
The minerals, as all matter, are subject to physical Laws,
most of which science has discovered and analyzed. In the
vegetable kingdom the Laws of life work automatically. In
the animal kingdom nature's moral Law finds unopposed
expression through instinct.1
It is only in the human kingdom that the Laws of nature
are militated against by man's self-sufficiency and by the
predominance of his desires over the mind. The primitive
races have kept at least a few remnants of nature's higher
Laws as an instinctive basis for their distorted rules of
taboo.* But with an increasingly selfish use of the developing
mind, mind itself has been subjugated and chained to
matter — and this has caused the civilized races to become
more and more blinded to the moral Law of nature.
Particularly blinding in this way is the enslavement of
mind and body to the allurement of sex. Man seems to
think that he is free to use the sexual function in any way
he wants. He reasons like an outlaw who imagines that no
law applies to him and that he is free to take whatever he
may want, so long as he is not caught. But results will
somehow ultimately show that one cannot with impunity
evade or break the laws — least of all nature's Laws, because
their application is automatic and inexorable.

Laws
All of nature's moral and spiritual Laws have been
pushed into the background of human consciousness, and
have been replaced by man-made legislation which ex
presses only the temporary moral standard of not yet highly
evolved majorities. However, "the eternal moral order . . .
cannot be canceled by civil laws."4
Civil laws have their useful place in the scheme of evo
lution. With humanity as it
is,
social life would be impos
sible without civil codes and laws. And where "the many
are more amenable to compulsion
.
.
.
than to moral
ideals"5, the rules laid down by legislation serve as
a
prepa
ration for
a
higher morality. Where the conscious touch
with nature's Laws
is
lacking the man-made "lenient laws
which are framed to meet the weakness of human char
acter'" can serve temporarily as substitute moral guides.
But since these substitutes are naught but changeable make
shifts, and are of unreliable strength, they cannot be ac
cepted as dependable permanent guides.
The best that can be expected as an immediate effect of
civil laws
is
to keep within the bounds of decency those who
are still sub-moral. But as
a
standard of true morality such
laws are quite inadequate. Anyhow, true morality cannot
be legislated into
a
person;

succeed in escaping legal punishment, it is not possible to
evade nature's retribution.
Those who have really outgrown the need of civil laws
have also outgrown every inclination to violate human laws
as much as nature's Laws.
"Nature will permit no violations of her Laws, even
though nations must perish in order to uphold them."11
Therefore "we must all strenuously seek to live in accor
dance with nature ... or else inevitably suffer disaster."1'
In regard to the sexual life we must remember that "chastity
. . . is the Law of nature."14 "In order to rise out of degra
dation, misery, poverty and ruin . . . the individual must
come to a clear understanding of this Law."15 "Instead of
wasting the life force in sex sensations . . . this energy
should be used in idealistic, constructive ability."14
In order to progress on the path of evolution man must
reestablish the link with spirit by consciously bringing his
physical as well as his mental life into harmony with nature's
fundamental Laws; for "that which links spirit to matter
... is the Laws of nature."17

TABOOS
" Chastity forms part of the rules
. . . known as taboo."
— Crawley, Studies of Savages and
SeXAAJ.
In strong contrast to the spreading lack of chastity among
the more or less civilized portion of humanity "the savage
may be said to possess a natural chastity."1 Where he has
lost this, "the sexual depravity of savage races most often
arises from the influences of civilized people."2
In territories inhabited by natives who were not yet
"contaminated by association with civilization and . . .
degraded by contact with white peoples"3, explorers have
found that "some tribes who are in other respects among the
lowest are in this respect among the highest."1 They dis
covered that "primitive man ... on the whole ... is
more moral than civilized man."5
Outstanding is the fact that "the majority of barbarous
peoples emphasize prenuptial chastity as an ideal.'" For
instance, in Borneo "prenuptial intercourse was forbidden
by the Hill-Dayaks"7 ; "in Nias both seducer and seduced
were put to death."8 In some of the independent tribes in
the interior of the Philippine Islands "chastity is held in
great honor . . . and is protected by very severe laws."9
In Australia "promiscuous intercourse between the sexes
is not practised by the aborigines, and their laws on the
subject . . . are very strict"10; "before the advent of the
whites ... it was almost death to a young man to have
intercourse before being married."11 "The Sulka in New-
Britain believe that sexual intercourse pollutes both men
and women, married as well as unmarried."1* "They who
have lived among the Tasmanians . . . speak with respect
of their purity."1' "Chastity was highly regarded by the
Basutos and the Bakwains"14 in Africa, where "the Nandi
. . . say that people are dirty when they have had sexual

intercourse."15 In Ceylon "among the Veddas . . . girls
are protected with the keenest sense of honor."16 By the
Bodos and Dhimals of India chastity is prized in man and
woman, married and unmarried."17 "Among the Cam
bodians strict chastity seems to prevail ; and if we cross the
Himalayas to the North we find ourselves among wild
people to whom sexual license is unknown."18
It cannot be denied that conditions of sexual depravity
have been found in places where it could not possibly have
been introduced by the white man. It would be strange if
this were not the case. For even low tribes possess enough
mind to be able to overstimulate and misdirect their sexual
impulse. All in all, however, there is plenty of evidence to
show that "the importance, even sacredness of procreation
is much more generally recognized by savage than by
civilized peoples"19, and that "primitive customs are
generally chaste."20
In the case of the lowest savages, who seem still very
close to the state of the animal kingdom, "we may speak of
an instinct for chastity."" Their mind hardly awakened,
they remain unconsciously dependent on the directions of
nature's intelligence. Undoubtedly their chastity is a sur
vival of an inborn and still instinctive obedience to the laws
of nature. They are yet not spoiled by a wrong use of the
mind.
With those at a slightly more advanced stage instinct
has been replaced by the unwritten law of taboo. And by
taboo "the sexuality of primitive man . . . seems to be
more strictly circumscribed than it is in higher levels of
civilization."22
Not only does one meet with taboos against fornication
and adultery, but "in certain physiological crises ... a
woman must not be approached by a man."23 And "the
extremely widespread habit of avoiding intercourse during
pregnancy and suckling ... is an admirable precaution in
sexual hygiene."24
Also, "many savages have made it a rule to refrain from
sexual intercourse in time of war"25; and even "before a
fighting, harpooning or hunting expedition.

tribes, during such expeditions, also "the people who re
main at home must observe strict chastity."
7
Then, again,
"a practice of abstinence from fleshly lusts has been observed
by various peoples as a sympathetic charm to foster the
growth of the crops."18
"The facility with which the savage places these checks
on sexual intercourse bears witness to the weakness of the
sexual impulse."19 That impulse is inherently weak in the
natural state ; in civilization it is strong only because it has
been unnaturally and unduly overstimulated.
In many rules of taboo it is evident that "savages . . .
esteem chastity for its value as a method of self-control
which contributes towards the attainment of important
ends."30 This is an attitude which civilization has lost, but
necessarily must regain.
The latest, most extensive ethnological investigations
show conclusively that always "there is a close relation be
tween sexual opportunity and cultural condition."31 "The
societies where prenuptial continence is not imposed and
where the opportunities for sexual indulgence after marriage
are greatest, exhibit the least amount of energy."33 In
other words: the more restraint, the greater the energy
available for the attainment of higher cultural conditions.
This applies not only to savages, but to civilized man as
well. "The energy created by sexual restraint is the motive
power which makes it possible for us to conceive desirable
ends, and to think out the means for realizing them."33
Whether, according to the individual's evolutionary pro
gression, the sought-for ends be of a physical, of a mental,
or of a spiritual nature : increased restraint increases the
obtainable .results.

LI
ABORIGINAL RELIGION
"Among many peoples persons whose
function it is to perform religious rites
must be celibates."
— Westermarck, Ethical Relativity,
viii,S53.
"From the primitive savage, kneeling before some sup
posedly sacred tree or holy stone, thrilled with the thought
that somewhere at the back of created matter vibrates a
Force beyond his knowing . . . down to the great faiths of
today, men have understood a reality behind the shifting
panorama of nature."1 And they have ever tried to discover
means of contacting that reality beyond material forms,
beyond matter — the reality that can only be found in the
formless realm of spirit.
Religion is the attempt to approach spirit; but spirit
can only be reached when religion is freed from routine
form. Of essential interest therefore are not the differences
in rituals and dogmas of the different religions, but the
points of agreement of their underlying principles. And of
these one of the most striking in the teachings of practically
all religions is the recognition of sexual purity as a prere
quisite for conscious contact with the unknown force, with
spirit.
Even "in primitive society chastity ... is enjoined on
solemn occasions."1 "It is a common rule that he who per
forms a sacred act . . . must be ceremonially clean; and
no kind of uncleanness is more carefully to be avoided than
sexual pollutions."3 It is almost generally believed that "an
act regarded as sacred would, if performed by an unclean
individual, lack that efficacy which would otherwise be
ascribed to it."4
Abundant evidence to support these last remarks has
been found in numberless tribes, in many parts of the world.

176 The Coiled Serpent
In Southern India the priests of the Todas "must be
celibate while in office."3 On the South Sea islands "the
skaga of the Haidas . . . refrains from sexual inter
course"6 ; "the Marquesan candidate for the priesthood had
to be chaste for some years beforehand"7 ; "in Efate sexual
uncleanness was especially avoided by sacred men, as it
destroyed their sacredness"8 ; and the Tahitians seemed so
convinced of the spiritualizing power of continence that
they had a doctrine to the effect that "if a man refrain from
all connection with women some months before death, he
passes immediately into his eternal mansion ... as if
already, by his abstinence, he were pure enough to be
exempted from the general lot.'"
In Africa "among the Tshi-peoples candidates for re
ligious offices are trained for two or three years ; during this
period the novices . . . must refrain from all commerce
with the other sex."10 "In Lower Guinea we are told of a
priest-king who was not allowed to so much as touch a
woman"11 ; while even "the cook of the priest-king of Angoy
was expected to keep himself pure."1 But the strongest
and strangest instance of belief in the influence of continence
was met with in the Congo, where "when the supreme
pontiff left his residence to visit other places within his
jurisdiction, all the people had to observe strict continence
the whole time he was out; for it was supposed that any
act of incontinence on their part would prove fatal to
him
"1s
In North America "the Shawnee Indian had a great
respect for certain persons who observed celibacy"14 ; and
"the Thlinkets believe that if a shaman does not observe
continuous chastity, his own guardian spirit will kill him"15
In Mexico "any incontinence amongst the priests was
severely punished ; the priest who was convicted of having
violated his chastity was delivered up to the people, who
killed him ; in Ichcatlan the high-priest was obliged ... to
abstain from commerce with any woman whatsoever, and
if he unluckily failed ... he was certain of being torn in
pieces."1'

Isthmus had a priesthood sworn to perpetual celibacy.""
In Guatamala "the Tohil priests were vowed to perpetual
continence"18; and "among the Chibchas of Bogota the
priests were not allowed to marry."1'
Sometimes strict continence was required of others, out
side the priesthood. For instance "the manufacturers of
the new Yucatan idols had to . . . preserve their con
tinence during the process""; also "in Yucatan they had
two war-captains, one of whom was chosen for a term of
three years ; during these years he could know no woman"" ;
and "the Chichen Itza kings lived in strict celibacy.""
Again, in Zapotecapan "it was incumbent upon the
pontiff of Yopaa ... to be a shining light of chastity for
the guidance of those who looked up to him"13; while
"priests of a lower order . . . added also to the credit of
their profession by the excessive rigor with which they
guarded their chastity ... A glance or a sign which might
be construed into a carnal desire was punished as criminal,
and those who showed by their actions a strong disposition
to violate their vow were relentlessly castrated.""
Some of these instances may be exaggerated and fanati
cal expressions of the conviction that continence is indis
pensable to the development of spiritual power. In our
materialistic age nearly everybody is inclined to apply to
all that has been said the banal epithet of superstition, which
is so commonly used to decry anything that one does not
and does not want to understand.
But does not this recurrence of a high regard and a re
ligious demand for chastity by so many different peoples in
the most diverse parts of the world suggest that something
more than superstition must be its fundamental cause?
Even "if . . . the institutions in question have been
based partly on superstition, it by no means follows that
they have never been based on anything else. On the
contrary . . . there is a strong presumption that they rest
mainly on something much more solid than superstition.""
The only logical basis for the universal religious valuation of
chastity lies in nature's law that yielding to the senses pre
vents all contact with spirit.

Apparently those who originally laid down the rules for
even the most primitive aboriginal religious usages were
acquainted with the fact that sensuality so coarsens the
vibrations of the body as to exclude the finer vibrations of
spirit. Therefore they already taught what humanity still
seems loathe to learn — namely: that "the animal life in
man must be subordinated to the spiritual."2'

LII
SACERDOTAL CELIBACY
" The lusts of the flesh . . . are par
ticularly weakening to him who would
give all his attention to the things of
spirit"
— Papini, Life of Christ,? \ 2.
Religion in any form, even when disguised almost beyond
recognition, is essentially a means of spiritualizing man, of
bringing him closer to spirit.
Where the individual is not capable of establishing a
direct connection with spirit, some other person — from a
medicine-man to an ecclesiastic — is depended on to aid
and to act as mediator. It is presupposed, of course, that
such an intermediary himself is already closely linked to
spirit. Therefore he should be expected to show in his daily
life that he has freed himself from the domination of matter
and from sensuous appetites.
Recognizing that "perfect mortification of passions
makes a true religious man"1, there has usually been a de
mand for sexual purity in those who minister to the people's
religious wants. This demand has been met even among
native tribes2, quite independent of the great world-religions.
Indeed, it seems to be but the expression of a universal prin
ciple that also in "the leading religions of cultured humanity
of the more recent epoch, Buddhism and Christianity" ,
"religious celibacy is enjoined . . . with a view to raising
the spiritual nature by suppressing one of the strongest sen
sual appetites."4
In Buddhism this rule of celibacy has been successfully
maintained, except in later sects on foreign soil. It is
asserted of the Buddhist priest that "having put aside the
habit and thought of sexual intercourse, his life is pure."'
In such old Buddhistic countries as Burma "popular opinion
is inflexible and inexorable on the point of celibacy . . .
The people can never be brought to look upon any person

as a priest or minister of religion unless he live in that state.
The law of celibacy is observed with a great scrupulosity,
and a breach of it is a rare occasion."6
In Christianity sacerdotal celibacy has been one of the
most disputed problems.7 It had already been a subject of
stirring controversy long before Protestants so drastically
turned against it in protest against abuses. Unfortunately,
instead of attacking and correcting the abuses, they have
repudiated the meritoriousness of celibacy itself. But abuses
are no proof that the principle which is being abused is
wrong. "Abuses and exaggerations . . . naturally accom
pany such a great and difficult attempt to elevate man above
himself."8 "The more sublime a doctrine
is,
the more
it
is
exposed to abuse at the hands of human nature.'"
Every part of this book tends to confirm that by sexual
gratification one "renders himself unfit for spiritual things"10
— unfit therefore to be another's spiritual guide. Only per
fect celibates can truly and effectively aid others in reaching
up to spirit
;
and even then only
if
their celibacy
is
freely
chosen, an outcome of their own inner conviction. Then,
"strengthening their own spiritual element .
.
. their purity
is
the elevation on which human nature culminates."11
To become ever more spiritual by outgrowing all carnal
desires — that
is
the purpose of religious attainment, not
only for ecclesiastics but for every single individual.

VESTAL VIRGINS
"Fire being incorrupt . . . the chast
est of all mortal things . . . must
look after the fire."
— Dionysius Halicarnassus, Ro
man Antiquities,\l,]xvi.
"Fire stands in every philosophical and religious system
. . . as a representation of the spirit."1 Therefore fire has
been worshipped, flames have been kept on altars (if only by
burning candles), and perpetual fires have been tended in
temples as a symbol of keeping alive the power of spirit.
In most places the care of such sacred fires was entrusted
to consecrated virgins, symbolizing the fact that sexual
purity is essential in keeping the spiritual fire within man
burning. "The ancients universally held virginity as a tran
scendental, mysterious something, which exercised power
supernaturally ."1 Wherever virgin-priestesses lived they
"were distinguished by extraordinary influence and personal
dignity."3 "They were treated with marks of respect usually
accorded to royalty."4
In Rome "Numa built a temple to Vesta and appointed
virgins to be her priestesses . . . under a necessity of con
tinuing unmarried. If they suffered themselves to be de
bauched they were delivered up to the most shameful and
the most miserable death."5 Even before Numa's time "at
Alba there was an ancient temple of the goddess Vesta'";
and besides her virgins there were "Juno's at the town of
Achaia, and Apollo's amongst the Delphians, and Minerva's
in some places."7 "The worship of Diana in her sacred grove
at Nemi was of immemorial antiquity . . . Her holy fire,
tended by virgins, burned perpetually in a temple within
the precinct."8 "Scattered over Greece were shrines minis
tered at by virgins"9 ; best known of these has always been
the temple at Delphi, where "the prophetess . . . entirely
gives herself up to a divine spirit, and is illuminated with a

Also in other parts of Europe vestals have existed.

of a perpetual holy fire"12; "in the island of Sena, off the
coast of Brittany, there was an oracle of a Gallic deity whose
worship was cared for by virgin priestesses"13 ; and "in Li
thuania there seem to have been holy fires that were looked
after by virgins."14
In some other parts of the world the worshippers turned
to the sun as the solar system's central fire, in which they
saw the manifestation of spirit. Connected with their wor
ship, too, were consecrated virgins. For instance "in ancient
Persia there were sun-priestesses who were obliged to refrain
from intercourse with men"15; and in Yucatan existed "an
order of vestals . . . whose duty was to tend the sacred fire,
the emblem of the sun, and to keep strictly chaste."16
Particularly esteemed among the Incas of Peru "was the
perpetual virginity which women observed in many conven
tual houses . . . These virgins were dedicated to the sun."17
"There was a law for the nun who should transgress this rule
of life, that she should be buried alive and that her accom
plice should be strangled . . . This was the law, but no one
ever transgressed it."18 And "besides those who professed
perpetual virginity in the monasteries there were many wo
men of the blood royal who led the same life in their own
houses . . . These women were held in great veneration for
their purity."19
Also in Mexico "women . . . took care of the sacred
fires. Nothing was more zealously guarded than the chastity
of these virgins. Any trespass was unpardonable."20
Thus in civilizations of a fairly advanced order a rev
erence for perfect chastity was frequently found, proving
again that it seems to be an integral part of man's spiritual
nature. The homage paid to vestals everywhere was an ex
pression of the intuitive recognition of the great significance
of unimpaired virginity as a means of linking up with spirit.

Vestal Virgins
Only an over-culture of the senses as providers of stimu
li for sensual gratification has gradually caused an ever
greater disregard of sexual purity, and has cut most of hu
manity off from any contact with the spiritual part of their

LIV
VIRGIN BIRTHS
"The idealization of virginity may be
observed in the stories of supernatural
birth."
— Crawley, Studies of Savages and
S*xj,30.
"Everywhere heroes of extraordinary achievement or ex
traordinary qualities have been of extraordinary birth."1
Especially those spiritual giants who are looked upon as sav
iors are almost without exception said not to have been born
like ordinary men, but from virgins. The birth story of Jesus
has, and had had before his era, its parallels in traditions of
other religions and in legends of many peoples.
The oldest recorded tale of immaculate conception is
about Sri Krishna, "this first of the Messiahs, this eldest of
the sons of God'", of whom it is told that he was born of the
virgin Devaki who, "seeing herself overshadowed by the
Spirit of the universe . . . conceived the divine child."3
About the Buddha "the belief soon sprang up that he had
no earthly father"4 ; "the opinion is authoritatively handed
down that Buddha had his birth through a virgin"5 ; "on her
. . . descended the spirit and entered her womb.'" "The
Siamese likewise had a savior, called Codom, who was vir
gin-born."7 Another instance, in Persia, is "the begetting of
Zoroaster through the drinking of homa-juice . . . infused
with his guardian spirit."8 And "in China the Shing-moo or
holy mother . . . conceived and bore a son while yet a
virgin. The infant became a great man and performed mir
acles."9
"A similar story is told in regard to Loatze."10 "Apol-
lonius . . . was also born of a virgin-mother according to
the stories that were recorded of him during and shortly
after his time."11 Even "Plato . . . was reputed by his fol
lowers to have been born of a virgin.""

Virgin Births
Among spiritual teachers and leaders on the American
continent is the Aztec "Quetzalcohuatl ... he who was
born of the virgin Chalchihuitzli"13, to whom "the Lord of
Existence appeared . . . and breathed upon her, thereby
quickening life within her."14 Similarly the ancient mentor of
the Mexicans, "Huitzilopochtli is said to have been miracu
lously brought forth by a woman who perceived a ball of
feathers floating down to her through the air, taking which
she found herself pregnant."15 And of Montezuma, "divine
priest, prophet, leader and legislator of the Pueblo cities of
New-Mexico"16, the legend tells how "he was immaculately
conceived by a drop of dew falling on the breast of his moth-
In almost endless variety such stories of miraculous con
ception are also related in connection with less spiritual, but
nationally idolized and idealized heroes. "In popular legend
and folklore it is almost incumbent on the hero to be born in
such an abnormal manner."18
"The Romans believed that the founders of their city
and race were the offspring of the virgin Ilia."18 They also
claimed that the mother of their king Servius Tullius "con
ceived by a phantom . . . when alone in the room in which
a miraculous manifestation had been seen to take place"10,
and "that the mother of Julius Ceasar conceived him mi
raculously in a temple of Apollo."11 "The emperor Alexan
der likewise was conceived by a virgin."22 "Cyrus, king of
Persia, was believed to have been of divine origin."13 "So
was the birth of the famous Genghis Khan ascribed to the
glance of a divine or quasi divine being."14 In Ireland "both
Conchobar and Cochulainn were of supernatural birth"15;
while in Bogota "Gacheta was a virgin who brought forth
Garanchaca, a famous chief."1*
"Fo-hi, the founder of the Chinese empire, was the child
of a virgin . . . who ate a certain flower."17 The Finnish
hero who became 'king and master of Karyala' was born
from "Mariatta . . . virgin-mother of the Northland."18
In a very similar way the American-Indian Hiawatha is
described as being the son of the virginal Wenonah and the
Westwind.29 "The incident appears in the mythology of more

than one American people"30, and "the supernatural birth
. . . is known in large groups of the Pacific Islands."31
Whether in its physical, biological aspect immaculate
conception ever did or could take place is not the question
here. And for present purposes it matters not whether in
its highest metaphysical aspect its oft repeated story first of
all may have been intended to symbolize the cosmic process
of creation — that is : the impregnation of virgin matter by
the divine breath, out of which a universe is born.
Of more general interest remains the indubitable fact
that so many peoples have deemed the ordinary way of pro
pagation to be too common, too coarse, too lowly for those
whom they worshipped. "In the popular mind the mightier
the hero the greater the need for providing him with a
worthy entrance upon his mortal existence."31 Popular be
lief has wanted such at least to be disconnected from and
raised above all vulgar touch of sex, and has therefore as
cribed their birth to an immaculate conception — in other
words: to a pure and passionless one. "Pure must be the
form into which such an individual is born."32 Race con
sciousness apparently has always, everywhere, intuitively
known that qualities worthy of worship belong to realms
where the sense of sex dwells not.
There
is,
however, still another aspect of the idea of im
maculate conception.
It
serves as
a
universal symbol of the
coming into expression in the human individual of what has
variously been called the higher self, the Christ within, the
spirit. In this aspect the idea of virgin birth shows explicitly
that only in the body of
a
virgin (of either sex) can spirit
come to fruition.

LV
THE BIBLE
"Walk in the spirit, and ye shall not
fulfill the lust of the flesh."
— Galatians,v, 16.
"All the great faiths have taught abstinence"1 ; and Chris
tianity too has not failed to bring out that "in purity lies the
essence of all religion . . . Always is purity insisted on as
a means to salvation."2 "Unless man doth partake of un
spotted virginity . . . the hope of salvation is cut off."3
"Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself'4,
knowing that "they which were not defiled with women
. . . were redeemed"5, and that "blessed are the unde-
filed."6 "Every one . . . should know how to possess his
vessel in sanctification . . . not in the lust of concupis
cence"7 — should know especially that "the lust of the flesh
is not of the Father"8, but that it is a man-made, mind-fed
distortion of the natural faculty to propagate the race.
"There is no enemy to the faith like the lower nature of
the individual"9, and "the carnal mind is enmity against
God."10 Hence the advice to "put off . . . the old man
which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts"11, and to
"make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts there
of."12 But how many Christians follow this advice? Their
marriage is frequently no more than the making of such a
provision.
"The essence of the New Testament is the negation of
sex"13, and "the recommendation of genuine and pure celi
bacy ... is expressed in the New Testament"1* in such
sayings as: "concerning virgins ... it is good for a man
so to be"15, "it is good for a man not to touch a woman.""
It is even stated that "it is not good to marry."" But "all
men cannot receive this saying"18, since it is meant for those
only who whole-heartedly seek spiritual unfoldment. "The
natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit . . . they

it,
let him receive it."10
The carnal "marriage, in genuine Christianity,

.
something allowed to those who lack strength to as
pire to the highest."" Such "marriage
is
a
concession to hu
man nature"
,
to human weakness.
It
is
accepted as some
thing apparently as unavoidable for spiritual infants as
diapers are for babes. "Better to marry than to burn"13, bet
ter let babies have diapers than be unclean.
At the same time
a
higher form of marriage
is
spoken
of, one in which "they that have mates be as though they
had none"14 —
a
marriage in which personal ties are based
on
a
community of spiritual interests and in which spiritual
love transcends physical attractions. This
is
the ideal mar
riage for men and women who seek support in each other in
an effort to outgrow the animal, to grow up to the spiritual.
And they will not fail to find that "the fruit of the spirit
is
love, joy, peace."15
The Gospel clearly shows what the requirements are for
those who long to hasten evolution. They should "walk not
after the flesh, but after the spirit"18, because "it is the spirit
that quickeneth
;
the flesh profiteth nothing."17 In an evolu
tionary sense, "to be carnally minded
is
death, but to be
spiritually minded
is
life."
A strict requirement for one who wishes to be
a
true
Christian
is
laid down in the statement that "they that are
Christ's have crucified the flesh with the passions and the
lusts thereof."19 Since "the flesh lusteth against the spirit"30,
it
is
evidently necessary to overcome the lusts of the flesh in
order to become spiritual. Some very practical hints are
given to help in this process
;
best of all
:
"whatever things
are pure
.
. . think on these things"31, and "let no filthy
communication come from your mouth"32; also remember
that "filthy dreamers defile the flesh."33
Through night and day the watchword is: 'to over
come'. "In the Scripture 'overcome'
is
used to symbolize the
triumph . . . over sex desire."34 "To him that overcom-
eth"35 great things are promised. In the end "he that over-
cometh

accomplished the purpose of existence in human form.
Definitely "according to the teachings of Scripture the
only way that perfection can be attained is by saving the
seed""; for "whosoever is born of God ... his seed re-
maineth in him."JS The Bible could hardly have been clearer
in teaching and beseeching people to "abstain from fleshly
lusts, which war against the soul"", and in emphasizing
the elevating power of sexual purity.

LVI
EARLY CHRISTIANITY
"The early Christians preached a doc
trine of sexual asceticism as the ideal
for those who would rise to the
heights of spiritual life."
— Bioelow, Sex Educationjifig.
A new movement is always purest in its inception, when it
is unencumbered by rules and by-laws of organization, not
yet encrusted with formalities. It has then not yet suffered
from commentators and interpreters. To find the motive
power of a movement it must be studied as it was in the be
ginning, when its adherents joined it from conviction, by
their own free choice.
In the early centuries "Christianity demanded purity of
life."1 "Strictness in morals and inner purity were the pri
mary requirements."2 As a result, "for nearly two hundred
years after its establishment the Christian community ex
hibited a moral purity which has never been surpassed.'"
"In the genuine and original Christianity the ascetic ten
dency is unmistakable ... It is the summit towards which
all strive upwards"4; and as in other ascetic movements
"celibacy was the first and always the chief asceticism."5
In the pure spiritual vision of the devotees "virginity
became the radiant ideal"8 — for men as well as for women,
for "there are virgins of both sexes."7
"Chastity was the supreme virtue . . . the mystic kev
to Christian holiness."8 "Enthusiastic converts took the vow
of chastity.'" "Some associated themselves with congenial
souls of the opposite sex and formed Platonic unions in
which they aspired to maintain the purity which they had
vowed"10; "this institution of spiritual mates continued to
flourish for many generations."11 However, "all vows of
continence . . . were a matter of individual volition"1', and
therein lay their strength. Vows cannot be very effective
unless they are the outcome of an inner conviction.

192 The Coiled Serpent
The writings of the early Church Fathers reflect the life,
the thoughts, the aspirations of the Christians of their day.
"All of these Fathers . . . speak of the chastity and sobriety
which characterized the sect . . . and of marriages of
which the sole object was the securing of offspring."1' "It
was urged that a believer should not touch his wife"14, ex
cept "only ... for the sake of children"15 — because "to
have intercourse except for procreation is to do injury to
nature.""
The Fathers exhorted their flocks to abstinence from sex
ual gratification because they considered such abstinence to
be "the practical method in the science of the divine life,
furnishing men with the power of assimilating themselves
with spiritual natures"" — in other words, because only
"by parsimony of the flesh can one gain the spirit."18 There
fore, they said, "renounce we things carnal, that we may at
length bear fruits spiritual."1' Every "kindling up of the
lurking passion . . . runs counter to the spirit"
0
; every
"indulgence of carnal thought and desire leads away from
it."11 "No man can serve . . . the flesh and the spirit.""
Thus among the early Christians we find the old, yet
ever new and ever true teaching that those who can should
overcome the serpent, "the creeping monster which . . .
devours the earth."" They should do so because "the desire
of lust . . . makes one a stranger to the language of the
spirit."14

LVII
MYSTICISM
"In mystic work the serpent must be
overcome."
— Sheerer, Problems of Mysticism,
111,277-
A mystic is one who in intense devotional contemplation
reaches up to union with the divine. "Mysticism is an en
tirely spiritual activity."1 "The business of the mystic . . .
is to remake his entire personality in the interest of his spirit
ual self."1 He must become spiritual ; and for this purpose
he must attain an uncommon purity of life. "The self must
be purged of its devotion to sense"3, because "only when the
tumult of the senses is stilled . . . can the eternal wisdom
be revealed to the one who seeks mystic communion."4
Therefore "the purification of the senses ... is the first
stage of mystic life."5
"A life of strict asceticism has seemed the only way by
which the carnal self could be purged."8 For this reason
"genuine mysticism cannot exist without asceticism.'" In
order to still the impulses of the senses the mystic must
adopt ascetic practices ; oft very rigorously at first, "as the
preliminary training for a larger spiritual life."8 And he
must normally continue some of those practices because the
spiritual exaltation which is a part of the mystic's life would
be impossible without asceticism. "The highest degrees of
spiritual exaltation are hardly conceivable without pro
longed mortification of sensual appetites.'"
Therefore "all the great mystics . . . observed strict
continence."10 "True mysticism has nothing whatever to do
with sexuality."11 "The true mystic . . . has risen above sex
to the planes where sex is not."11
"The mystical manuals show that for spiritual education
. . . the sexual libido must be withdrawn from its original
use."13 All the writings by mystics bring out the necessity of

sexual purity in their quest. Like most of the literature of
their time, the language of their dissertations is usually dull
and involved. But some of the clearest of their own state
ments follow.
"No one can be enlightened unless he be first purified."1*
And "purity ... is this: that a man withdraws from all
unchaste deeds in whatever manner they be."1' For "un-
chastity in actions takes away the purity of the body . . .
unchastity in thoughts takes away the purity of the soul."1*
"Chastity is the power which . . . opens the soul to the
things of heaven" , whereas "fleshly likings take a man . . .
far from the clear sight of spiritual things."18
"Animal-man merely gratifies an animal desire and
knows nothing of the delight of spiritual essences."1' "Only
by annihilating and subduing the passions can the under
standing become divine."10
"People think that we are in pain and great penance,
but we have more true delight in a day than others have in
the world all their lives."21 "Spiritual comforts exceed all the
delights of the world and all pleasures of the flesh.'"' Even
"although abstinences give some pain to the body, yet they
so lessen the power of bodily appetites and passions and so
increase our taste for spiritual joys, that even these severi
ties . . . add to the enjoyment of our lives."1*
"No bodily and fleshly pleasure can ever take place with
out spiritual loss."14 Even "a longing after sensual pleasures
is unapt for spiritual enjoyments."" Hence "we must purif)
ourselves from the affections which we have to venial
acts"1' ; for "these affections . . . weaken the powers of the
spirit."*7
"Perfection cannot be attained . . . until all passions
and fleshly lusts are burnt out"18 ; so that only "those who
fight against their own passions . . . may conquer and ob
tain perfection."19
"All who follow the lust of the flesh are dead in soul.""
To live the spiritual life of the soul "farewell must be said
to all that delights the senses ; the pleasures of the flesh must
be utterly renounced."31 For "as fire and water will not mix,
so spirituality and carnality cannot be experienced to
gether.""

The Coiled Serpent
All these quotations are from Christian mystics only.
But mystics have existed in every religion, and also in
dependent of established forms of religion. The similarity
of their experiences is one of the most convincing indications
that all forms of religion and of spiritual philosophy are
based on a single truth — on one reality, which the mystic
in his highest state of contemplation seeks to approach.
Quotations from other mystics, given elsewhere, will
supply additional proof that there is one requirement which
is unanimously acknowledged to be indispensable for their
work, and which no true mystic has ever failed to fulfill.
"They have transcended the sense-world in order to live on
high levels the spiritual life.'"3
The mystics often may have been one-sided in their con
centrated effort to reach a spiritualized consciousness. But
just as all others who have aspired to spiritual heights they
"have recognized the great transmutability of the sexual li
bido"34, and they have exemplified it as the most essential
need for spiritual development.
Not only to mystics but to all who seek to acquire greater
and lasting happiness through higher evolutionary attain
ment applies the rule that within oneself "animal-man must
be killed to make room for spiritual man.""

LVIII
CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
"The serpent pursues with hatred the
spiritual idea."
— Eddy, Science and Healthjvn,
Amongst modern religious movements Christian Science
demands attention. Having introduced applied metaphysics
into orthodox religion, it analyzes every subject in a way
characteristically its own. And from its unusual viewpoint it
joins other religions in supporting, in its highest teachings,
the ideal of sexual purity. Its founder's emphatic utterances
on this ideal are particularly noteworthy, because they
embody a restatement of the early Christian viewpoint, after
verification by a knowledge of modern psychology.
Holding that "it is not wise to take a halting and half
way position"1, "Christian Science commands man ... to
conquer lust with chastity."* It warns against "the down
ward tendencies ... of sensualism and impurity."* It even
holds that essentially 'celibacy is nearer right than mar
riage.'4
As of every other religion so of Christian Science the
purpose is to spiritualize its adherents in its own way. But
then, "there is but one way . . . which leads to spiritual
being."5 Since "there is no sensuality in spirit'", "spirit . . .
is [only] heard when the senses are silent."7 "The flesh and
spirit can no more unite in action than good can coincide
with evil."8
Those who "have hope in immortality"*, as Christian
Scientists have, must keep in mind that "nothing sensual
. . . is immortal"10; hence everything that in the least sa
vors of sensuality must be extirpated before the hoped for
immortality can be attained.
According to the teachings of Christian Science "cor
poreal sense is the serpent."11 And more definitely in its lit
erature the serpent is identified with lust. For the manual

Christian Science 199
speaks of "that old serpent whose name is devil"11, and then
defines "devil . . . [amongst other things as] the lust of the
flesh."1' Therefore the statement that "the serpent . . .
will struggle to destroy the spiritual idea"14 again brings out
that any remnant of sensuality is looked upon as an obstruc
tion to spirituality.
Moreover there is the very practical consideration that
"if sexual propensities were dominated by Christian love for
both the living and the unborn — a subject on which Chris
tian Science is emphatic — many existing charitable socie
ties would have no reason to be."15 For there can be no
doubt that there would be fewer hospital and asylum cases,
fewer ailing or deserted babies, fewer unfit adults to be taken
care of by charity, if considerations of love ruled humanity's
sexual expression.
So, from various angles sexual purity is insisted on ; and
"purity, from the Christian Science standpoint, is to be real
ized through an identification with and a longing and love
for purity."16
In popular thought Christian Science is best known for
its method of spiritual or mental healing.
Undoubtedly "the extent to which physical health de
pends upon the mastery of the spirit over the body has not
yet been fully realized."17 It cannot be realized and success
fully demonstrated until a high degree of sexual purity has
made spiritual development possible.
Spiritual, mental, or magnetic healing can be accom
plished only by the most pure. If Jesus obtained miracu
lous results in healing in such ways, it was possible to him
because "there never lived a man so far removed from appe
tites and passions as the Nazarene."18
Healers who lack that perfect purity may succeed in
raising physical health vibrations in a patient. But along
with this they are liable to transmit to the subject some of
their own mixed emanations of doubtful purity, which are
likely to prove detrimental in other than physical ways.
To emulate the spiritual healing powers of the Christ it
is prerequisite to emulate his perfect purity. This ideal state
can be attained by any one who really, in every way, will

ISLAM
"Whoever is afflicted with hist is
veiled from all spiritual things."
— Al Hujwiju, Kashf Al-Mahjub,
s xiv,209.
No religion can be judged by what the masses have made
of its teachings. One has to look for its highest aspect in the
lives and the writings of its wisest and most saintly adher
ents.
Among the Mohammedans the saintliest and wisest men
and women have always been the Sufis, the mystics of Islam,
"whose souls have been freed from the defilement of the
flesh."1 Their existence dates back to the days of their Pro
phet ; and already "the early Sufis wanted to be free from
all that concerned the phenomenal world in order to be free
for the world of spiritual things.'" Very soon "the Sufis real
ized the advantage of celibacy for the mystic"8; therefore
"sufism was founded on celibacy."4 "Sufism is ... to keep
far from the claims of the senses and to adhere to spiritual
qualities.""
"The natural desires in the Sufi are bridled with the bri
dle of knowledge"6; for he recognizes that while "man is
continually being directed by intellect and passion into con
trary ways . . . passion is a false guide, and he is com
manded to resist it."T
The Prophet himself had said : "Thy worst enemy is thy
nafs, which is between thy two sides."8 Nafs is "the seat of
passion and lust ... It constitutes the great obstacle to at
tainment."9 "Mortification of the nafs is the chief work of
devotion . . . No disciple who neglects this duty will ever
learn the rudiments of sufism. The principle of mortifica
tion is that the nafs should be weaned from those things to
which it is accustomed, that it shall be brought to recog
nize . . . the impurity of its actions."10

202 The Coiled Serpent
"Self-mortification as advanced Sufis understand it is a
moral transmutation of the inner man."11 They hold that
"complete independence from the carnal self ... is a state
which, if lost, means loss of eternal bliss."1' Their concept
of fana
— which in some respects closely coincides with the
Buddhist's idea of nirvana — "involves the extinction of all
passions and desires."13
The Sufis are not the only Mohammedans who are con
vinced that sexual acts interfere with spiritual expression.
"Among the Turks the order of Calenders is bound to per
petual virginity."14 "The Moors say that . . . when one is
sexually unclean . . . the reciting of passages of the Koran
is of no avail"15 ; and "a person who is sexually unclean is
not allowed to pray."16
Also any Mohammedan "would not dare to approach
the sanctuary of a saint in a state of sexual uncleanness.""
And in regard to the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every
good Mohammedan aspires to undertake, the Koran admon
ishes that "whosoever purposeth to go on pilgrimage, let
him not know a woman nor transgress during the pilgrim-
age."18
"The charge that Mohammed allowed men to pander to
their passions is ludicrous. He imposed fasts upon every one
of his followers to assist them to detach themselves from the
passions. He banned alcoholic drinks in order to assist their
efforts at self-control."19 "Long and frequent periods of sex
ual abstinence are enjoined. There must for instance be no
sexual intercourse . . . during the thirty days of the Rame-
dan fast."10 Although this rule is not strictly prescribed in the
Koran, it is so understood by the Sufis who hold that "the
religious practice of fasting . . . involves not only keeping
the belly without food and drink, but also guarding the eye
from lustful looks . . . the tongue from foul words, and the
body from following after worldly things."11 Only
"
one who
acts in this manner is truly keeping his fast."12 And "in ad
dition to the fast the Prophet" enforced . . . forms of self-
discipline, imposed with the aim of subordinating the hab
its of the body to the spiritual welfare of the soul.""

Whatever concessions Mohammedanism as it is prac
tised may have made to the masses, it nevertheless shows in
its teachings an understanding of the fact that "the aban
donment of sensual desires . . . draws the soul towards
heaven.""
In this way at least the esotericists among the Mo
hammedans reaffirm the basic law that a strict purification
of the sexual life is absolutely necessary for progressed
evolutionary unfoldment.

LX
JUDAISM
"If man purifies himself he will re
ceive the assistance of the holy soul."
— Tk* Zohar,lfo2A.
"The sanctity of perfect continence . . . may be traced
through the most distant ages and the most various creeds"1,
including Judaism.
It may be true that "Judaism was in some respects the
least ascetic of religions, but in it appear prophets . . .
whose lives were severely austere."2 Moreover, •
"that the
Jews . . . entertained ideas of peculiar sanctity as attach
ing to the restraint of the animal passion is shown ... by
the vows of continence of the Pharisees."3
Whole Hebrew sects have "regarded virginity as the
ideal of sanctity."4 Especially "the Essenes . . . lived in a
condition of celibacy" , while "the fear of . . . reinforcing
the lower appetites of the human being inspired the vege
tarianism of the Jewish Therapeutae."6 "In the Nazarenes
too the Jews possessed such a body of men."'
The Old Testament indicates that "among the Hebrews
we find the restriction [of sexual intercourse] in connection
with the theophany at Sinai, and with the use of consecrated
bread."8 "Those who celebrate the Passover also are bidden
to do so with their loins mortified."9 "Strict continence
was required of the Hebrew congregation . . . before en
tering the temple."10 And there is mention of "a similar ab
stinence being imposed by the old law on the Levites during
their term of service in the temple."11 Also "when the Is
raelites marched forth to war they were bound by certain
rules of ceremonial purity . . . and they had to practise
continence."12
Under all circumstances, over against all other views,
Judaism holds firmly to the purity of the human being."1'
It is even claimed that "Jewish ethics excels all other ethi

cal systems in its insistence on purity . . . Any unchaste
look, thought or act . . . and all profanity of speech is
declared to be an unpardonable offense."14
Conclusive proof of the Hebrews' appreciation of sex
ual abstinence can be found in the Talmud, which "treats
of the common law, customs and ritual considered essential
to the outward life of the Israelite."15
"The Torah [teaching, or law] has been revealed only
for the purpose of purifying human beings."18 And more ef
fectively than anything else, "abstinence leads to purity, and
purity leads to holiness."17 Therefore "be temperate and
chaste"18, and "purify and sanctify thyself from all ini
quity.""
. A splendid instance of Talmudic wisdom in regard to
sexual purity is contained in the lines stating that "there is
a small organ in the human body which is always hungry if
one tries to satisfy
it,
and always satisfied
if
one starves it.""
In their entirety, "the laws have been given to Israel to
purify
it
and to cleanse
it
from fleshly appetites."11
Hebrew philosophers too have strongly emphasized the
need of sexual purification.
Philo for instance "called attention to the moral disease
seated in the flesh."" He warned that "the passions injure
the mind"13, and that "their onset
is
swift and difficult to
withstand."" He affirmed that "the perfect man must be
pure in every word and in every action in his whole life."1'
Maimonides reminded his readers of the fact that "the
Rabbis . . . command that man should conquer his de
sires."28 And he held that "those who wish to be men in
truth
.
.
.
must constantly endeavor to reduce the wants
of the body, such as . . . cohabiting."*7
Later Hebrew thinkers made
it
clear that "moral regen
eration must be an outgrowth of one's own power
;
by great
struggles must one obtain .
.
. spiritual equilibrium."1'
"Despite the sensual propensity innate in man's nature he
is
vested with the power of conquering it."2* "The sensuous
desire in the body
is
. . . never
a
compulsion."30 Therefore
one must "lend no ear to appetite"", and "be chaste in
private even as in the market-place.""

206 The Coiled Serpent
In Judaism as in other religions the deepest and most val
uable wisdom is to be found in its esoteric teachings. The
Hebrew secret science, known as the Qabbalah, can be
found in its most accessible form in the Zohar, which "is
a Qabbalistic commentary on the Pentateuch wherein the
entire system of the Qabbalah is compiled.""
In the Zohar it is stated that "the mighty evil serpent
. . . roams about in the world, and thus the child of man
becomes polluted."34 "When that strong serpent begins to
arise, woe then unto thee!"35 Only "when man comes to
cleanse himself . . . the holy soul sanctifies him."38 "The
good spirit comes to him from the day he becomes pure.""
But "at the time man deviates from this way . . . the holy
soul no longer has a connection with him."
Knowing these sayings in the Zohar to be statements of
a universal law, "the original Qabbalistic companions led
an ascetic and holy life . . . lest the mysterious and occult
science might prove injurious to all concerned."3'
After all, the most powerful enunciation of nature's law
that spirituality cannot be combined with sexual indulgence
is contained in a masterpiece of Hebrew literature, namely
in the allegory of Adam and Eve and the serpent.
"By the serpent the Jews typified the enemy of man
kind.' And "according to rabbinical tradition the serpent
is the symbol of the sexual passion."" Hence the temptation
by the serpent characterizes mankind's yielding to the sexual
impulse for self-gratification as its surrender to the antago
nist of higher human attainment.
"The allegory of Adam [and Eve] being driven away
from the Tree of Life means . . . that the race abused the
mystery of life and dragged it down into the region of ani
malism and bestiality.""
This archaic Hebrew story records the fact that sexual
indulgence has caused humanity to be driven from paradise,
that is : from a purely spiritual manner of living. It teaches,
by deduction, that the only way to regain a paradisical spir
itual existence is along the path of sexual purification. This
lesson is the greatest gift of Judaism to the world.

LXI
THE RELIGION OF
ANCIENT EGYPT
" Let the state of the shining ones be
obtained ... in place of the satisfy
ing of the longing of lust."
— Book of the Dead.clxxv.
Only a fragmentary knowledge has been uncovered about
ancient Egypt. But even from the fragments can the fact
be verified that the Egyptians possessed deep knowledge
about the evolutionary and the regenerative importance of
sexual continence.
Their greatest spiritual leader was Thoth, better known
as Hermes, the name given to him by the Greeks. "The
Book of Thoth . . . contained the secret processes by which
the regeneration of humanity was to be accomplished."1 It
taught that "no man can be saved without regeneration"1,
and that this regeneration or "spiritual rebirth is an escape
from the delusions of the body"3, which "has with mass of
matter blocked the senses and crammed them full of loath
some lust."4
"All that in man is animal is proner unto bad than unto
good"5 ; and "where there's passion, nowhere is there good
... for where is night, day is nowhere. Thus "passions
and desires are ills exceeding great"7; but "greatest ill of
all is that each of these things is thought down here to be
the greatest good."8
However, it is possible to free oneself from these ills —
namely by "continence . . . the power against desire."'
Just "throw out of work the body's senses, and thy divinity
shall come to birth."10 Then "passion and desire withdraw
. . . and thus it is that man does speed thereafter upwards
to the harmony."11 And then "the knowledge of joy has
come, and on its coming sorrow flees away.""
Thus taught Thrice-Greatest Hermes.

The Religion of Ancient Egypt 209
Other indications of similar knowledge can be found in
the Book of the Dead, which is "the general body of texts
having reference to the burial of the dead and to the new
life in the world beyond the grave, which texts were in use
among the Egyptians since about 4500 B. C." 13
It contains such suggestive sections as : "The chapter of
repulsing the serpent" 4, and "The chapter of a man not
being bitten by a serpent."15 It speaks of "the serpent . . .
coiled round a lotus flower"" — this flower symbolizing
man, for the deceased is saying: "I am the pure lotus."17
In the chapter generally known as "The Negative Con
fession"18 the person who has left the physical body appears
as an applicant for spiritual instruction. To prove his wor
thiness he is saying: "I have not . . . defiled my body"1*,
"I have not committed fornication"10, "I have not polluted
myself"11, "I have not lusted . . . nor have I done any
other abominable thing""; "I am pure, I am pure, I am
pure.
Triumphant sounds the announcement in another part
of the Book of the Dead: "The Apophis is overthrown!""
Now, "Apophis is the serpent . . . the symbol of human
passions."85 Also "Apophis is the enemy of Ra (who is
Light)."" The passions are ever known as the enemies of
spiritual enlightenment.
Thus taught the Book of the Dead ; and accordingly "the
destruction of the serpent . . . frequently occurs in the
Egyptian sculptures.
"w
That the power of sexual purity was recognized in ec
clesiastic circles is proven by the fact that "chastity and
purifications were common to all the Egyptian priests."18
And that moreover the efficacy of abstinence was popu
larly acknowledged becomes apparent when one reads that
"when any king died all the inhabitants of Egypt united
in mourning for him for seventy-two days . . . and no one
would have dared to indulge in sexual intercourse during
that time."18
Thus in ancient Egypt as elsewhere was abstinence from
sexual acts known to have an efficacious influence extending
far beyond the physical realm.

LXII
HINDUISM
" Spiritual wisdom is the fruit of in
difference to sensual pleasures."
— Adhyatma Upanishadj,$.
The sacred books of the Hindus, which originated in more
ancient times than any other known records, contain an
inexhaustible store of wisdom. All of the most profound re
ligious and spiritually philosophic ideas of the Occident as
well as of the Orient can be traced back to this source.
"In the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so
elevating as that of the Upanishads"1 ; and these themselves
are but commentaries on the still deeper Vedas.
"From the earliest Vedic age Hindu thought turned to
. . . annihilations of the carnal desires."1 Even in imme
morial times the fact was well known that "only through a
chaste life can a student find the sacred knowledge."3 "A
command over our passions ... is declared by the Vedas
to be indispensable in the mind's approximation to the di
vine."4 Sexual purity was held to be so imperative for an un
derstanding of things spiritual that several of the Upani
shads close with a remark to the effect that "the supreme
mystery of the Vedas is not to be declared to those whose
senses are not subdued."5
To grow up to be a worthy member of his caste the
young Hindu was given in full charge of a guru (teacher),
who considered it "a most fortunate circumstance if he
found in his pupil a natural aptitude for the pure life'",
since only "he who is . . . ever pure reaches the goal."7
"Neither the study of the Vedas . . . nor austerities ever
procure attainment to one whose heart is contaminated by
sensuality."8 During the whole period of apprenticeship,
which lasted until after his twentieth year, the youth was
bound by vow to the 'Rules of Studentship', one of the
strictest of which reads : "He shall preserve his chastity.'"

212 The Coiled Serpent
Those who wished to devote themselves to the highest
possible spiritual existence preserved their undefiled juvenile
chastity through the rest of life. An outstanding modern ex
ample of this was the saintly Ramakrishna, who in the
nineteenth century taught and exemplified a return to the
original rules of purity of orthodox Hinduism. "He was a
triumphant example, a living realization of the complete
conquest of lust."10 And long before him "many thousands
. . . who were chaste from their youth have gone to
highest heaven without continuing the race."11 Also "for the
women whose temperament induced them to remain single
and unmarried the life of the celibate was open in the same
way as for the men""; "there were female ascetics as well
as male."13
But for the majority the student period was followed by
that of a householder. The adult, "to discharge his duty to
society . . . must beget children, not only that the race
might be continued but also that bodies might be supplied
by parents devoted to the ideal of the religious or philosophic
life, so that advanced souls might find birth in favorable
conditions. This is the ancient rule laid down by the Manu
of the Aryan Hindus."14
The 'Laws of Manu' were given by this great teacher of
the Aryan race "for the training of a nation of energetic,
powerful, nobly mannered and dignified men."15 In their
marriage "great temperance in sexual relations was en
joined"1' by these laws, practically intended to restrict sexual
congress as closely as possible to procreative purposes only.
"Wise and grand, far-seeing and morally beneficent are the
laws of Manu on connubial life, when compared with the
license tacitly allowed to man in [so-called] civilized coun
tries."17 Based on these laws "the noblest ideal of married
life ever given to the world is found in Hinduism, of hus
band and wife drawn together by spiritual affinity rather
than by fleshly desire . . . and joined for spiritual
growth."18
After the service to the race was accomplished, after
the children grew up, the parents were free to go into se
clusion, taking up "the life in the forest, husband and wife
. . . leading there a life of peaceful contemplation"", and

"delighting in what refers to the soul . . . entirely abstain
ing from sensual pleasures."10
Thus the life of the spiritually-minded Hindu was nor
mally passed in an ideal way, "in a series of gradually in
tensifying ascetic stages, through which he was more and
more purified from all earthly attachment . . . The entire
history of mankind has not produced much that approaches
in grandeur to this thought."" And back of
it,
always,
is
"the conviction that, to become perfect, the sex idea must
go.""

LXIII
BUDDHISM
" Cut down the whole forest of lust!
When you have cut down every tree
and every shrub, then you will be
free I"
— Buddha, Dhammapada,xK,i83.
Nowhere clearer, stronger, or more persistently has
perfect chastity been exhorted than in the teachings of the
Buddha. "The Buddha's foremost aim was to lead human
beings to salvation by teaching them to practise the greatest
purity."1
"Buddhism, in its origin at least, is an offshoot of Hin
duism'", which had already proclaimed the ideal of the
purified life. But "at the time of the Buddha . . . the purer
Vedic teaching was smothered under a mass of fables . . .
Rite and ceremonial were all."3 "Moral life suffered since
metaphysical subtleties . . . absorbed the energies of the
people."4 Even those of the priestly caste, "the Brahmanas
. . . had fallen into the power of sensual pleasures.""
Under such conditions "it was the task of the Buddha
to provide a firm foundation for morality."6 He "reaffirmed
the ancient ideal, the essence . . . consisting in spiritual
development."7 In himself "we have a seer of the highest,
most developed spiritual power"8, who "believed in the
liberating influence of ethical discipline.'"
However, in our days as in those of the Buddha, "his
doctrine will not be easily understood by beings that are lost
in lust."10 Such as these will hardly be found willing to ac
knowledge that "when a person has not got rid of . . . the
attraction to lusts ... he has not yet broken through the
first bondage in which the spirit is held."11
"Buddhism regards sensuality as altogether incompatible
with wisdom"1*, with that intuitive spiritual knowledge
which "is the greatest treasure of man."13 Only "when we
have the deeper illumination born of moral life we shall
have the true enlightenment"14, the true wisdom. "Only he

who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain, is
wise."15
Hence "the life of chastity is lived ... for the purpose
of insight and thorough knowledge."16 Yet not for this pur
pose only, but also "for the sake of properly making an end
of misery."17
More attractive than wisdom to most people is happiness
and liberation from suffering.
On this the Buddha's teachings are particularly con
centrated. How to free mankind from misery was the ul
timate purpose of his searchings, and it is the essential part
of his message. To be sure, "he did not offer any cheap re
lief . . . There is no appeal to human selfishness, for
Buddhism demands a rigorous renunciation of all the plea
sures most men care for."18 However it "not only takes away
... it provides an irreplaceable substitute for what is so
taken"19, a substitute in the form of the superb joy that goes
with freedom from suffering.
Having found that "the origin of misery is desire . . .
especially desire for sensual pleasure"20, the Buddha taught
that "the noble truth of the cessation of misery ... is the
complete fading out of this desire."11 "From him who over
comes this fierce thirst . . . sufferings fall off like water-
drops from a lotus leaf."12 Therefore "if one longs for hap
piness, let him cast off all desires"13 ; for only he "who de
lights in purity . . . gradually arrives at felicity."14 "Free
dom from lust . . . this truly is the highest happiness."15
"Those who are set free through the entire destruction of
craving, only they have attained the ideal."16
It was not to his advanced disciples alone, not for the
monks alone, but for the sake of all who would free them
selves from misery and attain the greatest possible happiness,
that the Buddha said: "I proclaim the annihilation of lust
... I teach the doing away with lust."17
Often heard is the criticism that in the concept of
Nirvana the Buddha taught total annihilation. But "Nir
vana does not mean a complete blowing out of the individual
soul, but rather . . . the subsiding of all human passions."28

LXIV
INDIAN PHILOSOPHY
"
When a man follows . . . the way
of the body, true wisdom is not born
within him."
—Sankaracharya, Crest Jewel of
Wisdom,273.
"Man's never-ceasing effort to . . . raise himself above the
level of the beast to a moral and spiritual height finds a
striking illustration in India"1 — not only in its religions
but also in its great philosophical systems, towards which
many of the foremost thinkers of the Occident have turned
for inspiration. "Even the loftiest philosophy of the Eu
ropeans . . . appears faltering and feeble in comparison
with the abundant light and vigor of the Oriental idealism."1
Philosophy in India as elsewhere stands apart from re
ligious creed and doctrine, from devotions and other ob
servances; but in common with the highest aspect of all
religion "philosophy in India is essentially spiritual."3 It
"is recommended not as with us for the sake of knowledge,
but for the highest purpose that man can strive after in this
life"4, which is a realization of spiritual understanding.
This it seeks to attain through contemplation, for which
a clarified mind is deemed indispensable. For the purpose of
preparing the mind to grasp the deepest abstract concep
tions its profound systems have always contained simple,
morally uplifting maxims for practical application, in which
the basic idea has never been lost sight of that "ethical
perfection is the first step towards spiritual knowledge."5
Above all, strikingly noticeable, is "the sublimity with
which . . . Indian philosophy expatiates upon and de
mands the removal of sensuality.'" "The ancient philoso
phers of India . . . preached as with a voice of thunder to
subdue the passions of the senses."7 They call "lust and
temptation . . . the sharks in the river of life"8, and remark
that "he who rejoices in the objects of senses and passions

They hold that "the pleasures that are contact-born . . .
not in these may engage the wise."10 And in their flowery
way they state that "as the dawning of the day is simul
taneous with the passing of the night, so is the dawning of
true knowledge simultaneous with the passing of desire."11
A person "who would bring his mind into a fit state for
contemplation must be devoid of desire and observe invari
ably continence"1*; for only the mind of those "who have
controlled their senses can attain the spiritual regions."13
In this direction one's very "aspiration ... is stifled by
the net of unspiritual desires."14
Through spiritual realization "every school of Indian
philosophy seeks liberation from the limits of painful exis
tence." In almost identical language they agree that
"liberation is nothing but the cessation of the impedi
ments"1' ; and since passion in every form is pointed out as
one of the strongest impediments17, it is evident that he "who
is affected with passions cannot obtain liberation."18
"Fascination by the body ... is the great death for
him who is seeking liberation."19 "If you long ardently for
liberation, put sensuous desires away"s0, for just as "fire
when fed with fuel blazes forth"11, so "one's appetites are
never satiated by indulgence"** but are only increased by
every gratification.
The leading systems of philosophy in India "all under
take to supply the means of knowing the nature of the Su
preme Being."13 But in doing so they call attention to the
fact that "one who is drawn to earthly pleasures can never
see Brahma."14 Only if "freed from passion . . . and puri
fied in the fire of wisdom, men have entered into a realiza
tion of the Supreme."15 Only "when one cherishes no desire
. . . then is one said to have attained to the state of
Brahma."1"
"In still another respect all the leading systems of In
dian philosophy are alike: they always promise . . . the
attainment of the highest bliss that can be attained by
man."17 This consists in "the felicity which arises from the

the purified"19, such felicity "surely comes to one . . .
whose passions and desires are subdued."30 Unfailingly
"those who have discarded all pleasures of the senses . . .
attain the supreme bliss."31
All of which shows that Indian philosophers, who with
unparallelled sagacity and profundity have reasoned the
matter out, come to the one conclusion : that for all spiritual
attainment "one must . . . free oneself from sensuality"'1,
one must become pure.

LXV
CHINESE PHILOSOPHY
"To be guileless and pure . . . this is
the way to nourish the spirit."
— Kwano-Tze, Kho-Ijii.
The way to a spiritualized existence, which has always been
the subject of every uplifting philosophy as well as of re
ligion, has long been known in China as the Tao.
China's philosophers discussed the Tao many centuries
before any sign of culture existed amongst white races. For
what Lao-Tze, Confucius and others taught about six cen
turies B.C. was but a systematized compilation of what some
of their forefathers already had been thinking and teaching
through several generations. "Confucius's own acknowl
edgement that he was 'a transmitter and not a maker' . . .
is well known"1 ; and as to Lao-Tze, "there was a Taoism
earlier than his."*
If China, the land of the crouching dragon, had absorbed
the spiritual sunlight that floods the Tao, and by a concen
tration of its rays had withered the dragon of the senses, it
could have become the world's center of spiritual enlighten
ment. It would have been exemplifying the highest sexual
ethics.
Even as it
is,
the educated classes among "the Chinese
exalt and deify chastity as a means of bringing soul and
body nearer to the highest excellence"3 — not only for the
women, but "it
is
held up as an ideal even to men."* "The
reason why all men are not able to attain to this
is
that their
minds have not been cleansed, and that their desires have
not been sent away."5 Therefore "during all hours of the
day let one's thoughts be constantly fixed on absolute pu
rity."6 "Purity
is
that in which the spirit
is
not impaired."7
As to desires, "no food
is
better for the heart than few
desires."8 "Where lusts and desires are deep, the springs of
the heavenly are shallow"*
;
but "if you keep your body as
it
should be, the harmony of heaven will come to you."1'

Chinese Philosophy 221
For this reason "the superior man . . . guards against
lust."11 Only "he who is desireless can sound the deep
spiritual mystery of things."1'
Having found the Tao, having become spiritualized,
"the superior man does not say [in regard to desires] 'it is my
nature'."13 He does not try to find excuses for acts which are
inimical to his stage of development. He knows too well
that "the spirit of man loves purity"14, and that "sensuality
is the chief of vices."15 Therefore "the wise man . . . puts
away indulgence."1'
"The men who understand the Tao do so simply by
means of absolute purity"17 ; for only "he who has this ab
solute purity enters gradually into the true Tao."18 Hence
"it is he who can embody purity whom we call the true
man.
These few quotations from Chinese philosophical writ
ings show how they, too, contain the same basic insight
which is found everywhere else — namely that "purity . . .
gives the correct law to all."20

LXVI
GREEK AND ROMAN PHILOSOPHY
"The true votaries of philosophy ab
stain from all fleshly lusts."
— Plato, Phaedofia.
The greatest of the Greek and Roman philosophers based
their opinions on secret teachings. These they had obtained
either through direct superphysical contacts and experi
ences, as did for instance Plotinus1 ; or through initiation in
the Ancient Mysteries, as in the case of Plato and of
Iamblichus3 ; or by going like Pythagoras4 and Apollonius'
to the centers of transcendental learning in India and in
Egypt-
Others absorbed such knowledge indirectly from the
teachers around whom they gathered. Thus the ancients
touched a source of metaphysical and of spiritual informa
tion to which later philosophers have rarely had access.
This touch has given the indisputably lasting value to their
writings; and it is the reason why "there is an ascetic ele
ment in all the great philosophies of the past."6 Almost
without exception they offer cathartic teachings for practical
soul-development.
From Pythagoras to Proclus, who lived a thousand years
apart, there is an ever recurring insistance on purification
as a means of attaining to a superior human existence. And
most of the teachers knew the value of such purification
from their own experience, from what they themselves had
attained by striving to exemplify it in their own lives.
"The whole school of Pythagoras made chastity one of
its leading virtues."7 "The main end and design of his
philosophy was to disengage the mind from the bonds of
the body"8, and "to free the soul from the fetters of sense.'"
This is evident from his exhortation : "Fight and overcome
thy foolish passions, be sober and chaste."10 He and his
followers considered that "continence precedes the acquisi

tion of every good"11, and that "it is impossible for the same
person to be a lover of body and of divinity."11 "The life
represented by the thraldom of the senses the Pythagoreans
conceived to be spiritual death, while they regarded death
to the sense-world as spiritual life."1'
Of sexual indulgence Pythagoras said that "it is always
harmful and not conducive to health."14 "And once when
he was asked when one might indulge in sex he replied,
'whenever you want to be weaker than yourself'."1 "In
the first place ... we should not have sexual connection
for the sake of pleasure, but only for the sake of begetting
children."1' For "nature produced the seed for the sake of
producing children, and not for the sake of lust."17
The best known of the later Neo-Pythagoreans, "Apol-
lonius of Tyana . . . lived a life of celibacy."18 "While yet
a mere youth, in full bodily vigor, he mastered the madden
ing passion."19 Without this accomplishment it would have
been impossible for him to show all through life such a
remarkable degree of spiritual attainment.20 So successful
was he in this respect that after his death "his name was
invoked as a being of superhuman powers.""
About Socrates we have the declaration by one of his
own disciples that "his great continence was known to every
one."" Others have said that "he could never be persuaded
that one's felicity was placed in the enjoyment of corporeal
delights."" "He rebuked the licentiousness of his age con
tinually, and sought to shield his disciples from its con
tamination."" "So long as they were with him they found
in him an ally who gave them strength to conquer their
passions."15
"He exhorted his companions to practise self-control in
the matter of sexual indulgence.
"M
"Of sensual passion he
would say: 'avoid it resolutely; it is not easy to control
yourself once you meddle with that sort of thing'."27 And
"his own self-control was shown by his deeds yet more
clearly than by his words."28
All told, "the Socratic philosophy . . . bids the heart
turn from the temporal to the eternal ; and it does so . . .
by sublimating erotic passion."19

224 The Coiled Serpent
Plato, the greatest exponent of Socratic philosophy, nat
urally offers much material for a work which is essentially
ultra-platonic. Therefore quotations from his writings occur
in several sections of this book. Far from advocating or up
holding any yielding to the body's impulses "Plato describes
how the man who restrains passions ... is led to the
goal."30 And he himself "refrained from all venereal plea
sure through love of contemplation of truth."31
"He based his moral system upon the distinction be
tween the bodily or sensual and the spiritual part of our
nature."32 The latter he called the soul, and "he never for
a moment assumed . . . that the body could be important
enough to receive consideration ahead of the soul."
"Nature orders the soul to rule and the body to serve."84
But in far too many people, unfortunately, "the body is the
grave of the soul."35 Since "the body is always breaking in
upon us, causing turmoil and confusion"39, "we make the
nearest approach to wisdom when we . . . are not sur
feited with the bodily nature but keep ourselves pure.""
Hence especially "a philosopher will calm his passions"38;
"by no means . . . ought a philosopher to care about the
pleasures — if they are to be called pleasures — of sex.""
Plato makes an idealistic effort to find "a way to make
men . . . abstain from intentionally destroying the seeds
of human increase, or from sowing them in stony places
in which they will take no root." This ideal of Plato's,
carried out in all its logical consequences, is identical with
the one presented in the volume in hand. For only when the
physical expression of sex is limited to propagation is there
no intentional destruction and waste of seed.
To Aristotle, the great independent thinker, is ascribed
a volume" written for Alexander the Great, whose tutor
he had been. In it he advises to "avoid the inclinations to
animalistic pleasure, for . . . such pleasure brings with it
stains on the soul."42 "Do not yield to the desire for sexual
intercourse"43, for "what glory is it ... to follow the
action of brutes?"44 Moreover, "sexual intercourse involves
the destruction of our bodies, the shortening of life."45 "The
self-restrained man stands firm against passion."48

Greek and Roman Philosophy 225
Cicero, the eclectic, "culled from every accessible phi
losophy those elements which were regarded as most help
ful for the higher life."" He found that "nothing is more
hostile to this . . . than sensual pleasure."48 "Such plea
sure . . . extinguishes completely the light of the soul.""
In fact, he avers that there is "no more deadly curse . . .
than carnal pleasure."80
Therefore "we should be made to understand . . . how
noble it is to live with abstinence.""
Even Epicurus — popularly supposed to be the apostle
of pleasure, of any form of pleasure as the highest good —
taught that "no one was ever the better for sexual indul
gence, and it is an exception if he be not the worse.
"H
And
he stated that "all such desires as lead to no pain when
they remain ungratified are unnecessary, and the longing
is easily got rid of."58
This last statement strikingly coincides with Plato's
saying that "the desires of which one may get rid ... of
which the presence does no good, and in some cases the re
verse of good . . . are unnecessary."" Both statements de
finitely apply to sexual desires, the unfulfillment of which
in normal cases leads to no pain and which can be over
come with little effort.
In every way "Epicurean ethics rise much higher than
the ethics of mere pleasure."55 Epicurus himself wrote-
"When we say that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not
mean the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do
by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepre
sentation."58 Even in his own days he was misinterpreted
by the seekers of body-pleasures.
Only in misconstrued and popularized form has Epicu
reanism been turned into a doctrine inculcating bodily satis
faction. In essence the Epicurean philosophy is one of pure
joy, more than of impure pleasure.
According to the Stoics "the passion of lust is a craving
from which good men are free." "The stoic ideal was pas-
sionlessness."

"Stoicism ... in placing the happiness of
life in intellectual and moral action, destroys the tempta
tion of sensual gratification."59

226 The Coiled Serpent
Zeno, founder of the stoic system of thought, defined
"passion ... as irrational and unnatural, or as impulse
in excess."80 And his disciple Chrysippus said that "the
cause of disharmony and of an unhappy life is that men fol
low . . . the lower animal principle and let it run away
with them."61
Seneca, foremost amongst the Stoics, reiterated that
"sexual desire has been given to man not for the gratifica
tion of pleasure but for the continuance of the human
race."" "When once you have escaped the violence of this
secret destruction implanted in your very vitals, every other
desire will pass you by unharmed."63 Carnal "pleasure is a
low act, brought about by the agency of our inferior and
baser members."94 It is "short, and apt to pall upon us . . .
There is nothing grand about
it,
nothing worthy of
a
man's
nature.'"5 All told, "passions are objectionable impulses."69
"There await us,
if
ever we escape from these low dregs
.
. . peace of mind and perfect liberty.'"7
Epictetus, another Stoic, declared that "what you give
to your body you presently lose, but what you give to the
soul remains forever."88 Therefore "you must altogether
control desire"99, and "aspire to converse in purity with
your own pure mind."70 "Chastise your passions that they
may not chastise you."71 "You will be free when you deliver
yourself from appetite."72
And Marcus Aurelius called attention to "what revolt
ing creatures men are in sexual intercourse."73 He stated
that "the pleasures of sexual love are derived from the most
grossly animalistic causes"74, and advised to "put aside
.
. . all accretions born of the fleshly affections."75 He
warned against "allowing the spiritual part to be defeated
by
.
.
. the body with its gross pleasures"76, and urged one
"never to be overpowered either by the senses or the appe
tites, for both are animal."77
"A fresh stimulus to asceticism was found in the neo-
platonic philosophy."7'
Plotinus for instance "requires
a
purification of being,
a
complete alienation of desire from external things."7* "If

to bodily sensation ... is to win back his grace, it must be
his business to scour and purify himself."80 "Let the soul but
be cleared of the desires that come by its too intimate con
verse with the body and be emancipated from all the pas
sions."81 "The pleasure demanded for the sage's life cannot
be in . . . any gratifications of the body, for these stifle
happiness.""
Porphyry, most eminent disciple of Plotinus, held that
"venereal connections are attended with defilement. All ven-
ery pollutes."83 Surely "the gods do not hear him who in
vokes them if he is impure from venereal connections.
"M
"If we wish to liberate ourselves from the fetters of the cor
poreal nature we must withdraw . . . from the passions."85
"To worthy men abstinence from corporeal pleasures is ap
propriate."8'
Iamblichus, pupil of Porphyry, remarked that "a vene
real connection proceeds . . . not from divine necessity."87
And Proclus, last of the Neo-Platonists, postulated that
"the one salvation of the soul is ... a flight from every
thing which adheres to us from generation . . . since such
a flight alone cuts off and obliterates the passions."88
Now, some will peremptorily reject whatever the an
cients have said, claiming that none of it is applicable to
modern, changed conditions.
But the subject of their philosophy, man, is not much
changed. And "for an understanding of human nature we
are still very largely dependent, as they were, upon intro
spection, general observation and intuition."88 Of all these
factors the ancients, in their less turbulent existence, could
make much better use than we who live in an age of speed
and feverish excitement and exclusive preoccupation with
materialistic interests.
In our concentration upon the physical changes which
science and sociology bring about, we are apt to forget that
beyond all worldly changes there remain the unchanging
laws of nature. The laws which not only keep the stars in
their courses, but which regulate the evolution of microcosm
as well as of macrocosm, are as immutable and eternal as
ever. And also the result of any violation of these laws is

still the same as it was in the days of the Greek and Roman
philosophers. And they, "the sages of former times knew
more about the fundamental laws of nature than is admitted
today."94
Hence their opinions about men and morals are basic,
and thereby as relevant and pertinent now as when first
promulgated. The unanimity of their expostulations against
sexual gratifications forms a valuable link in the chain of
evidence in favor of the ideal of purification.

LXVII
MODERN PHILOSOPHY
"How much more are . . . the per-
ceiver and obeyer of truth than the
foolish and sensual millions around
them!"
— Emerson, Progress of Culture.
The era of ancient philosophy faded out into the dark
ages of mental and spiritual stupor. During that period of
lethargy the component elements of the philosophy of the
ancients — mind and spirit — fell apart. When the dawn
of enlightenment broke through again, the spiritual element
had been absorbed by mysticism, while the mental part,
uniting with science, developed into modern philosophy.
Basing itself on material facts, and vaguely speculating
upon non-material things, modern philosophy lacks spiritual
knowledge and also lacks directions for the acquisition of
such knowledge. In the involved mental gymnastics of mo
dern philosophy there is little place for idealistic moral con
siderations. Especially — as system follows system, each of
fering a different set of intricate conjectures — rarely a
word is said about the need of sexual purification for evolu
tionary growth. On the contrary the most modern, more
and more materialistic systems are if anything antagonistic
to the ideal of such purification. "The domestic relations of
human beings are reduced by the behavioristic theory to
the mere means of securing sexual gratification"1; and
"under the naturalistic view love ... is merely the borrow
ing of a temporary bodily gratification."1
"And so they wander further amid the mazes of error
and imagine vain philosophies, wallowing in the sloughs of
materialism and sensualism."3
Yet here and there, sporadically, one finds a touch of
spiritual insight, a recognition such as by Emerson that
"spiritual is stronger than any material force"4; or such

statements as Santayana's that "mortal spirits ... in so far
as they free themselves from false respect for animal pas
sion, may behold finite being in its purity"5, and that "spirit
uality is conditioned by ... a temperament disciplined
into chastity and renunciation.'"
Then there is Eucken with his philosophy of the spirit,
who realizes that "within humanity there is an endeavor to
. . . free the life of the soul from the bondage of sense'",
and that "all human morality must have its basis in . . .
the spiritual life."8
Also it is not so long ago that Sidgwick wrote: "It is
agreed that the sexual appetite ought never to be indulged
for the sake of sensual gratification."9 At about the same
time Solovyof emphasized that "the flesh is strong only in
the weakness of the spirit"10, and that "supremacy of the
spirit over the flesh is necessary in order to preserve the
moral dignity of man."11
In the seventeenth century Spinoza founded one of the
first schools of modern philosophy. He "gave us a system of
morals which is the supreme achievement of modern
thought."" He posited that "chastity ... is not a passive
state but indicates a power of the mind."13 And from per
sonal experience he declared that "the true good becomes
more and more discernible . . . after one recognizes that
sensual pleasure is only a hindrance."14
Shortly before Spinoza's time Descartes had taught that
"the principal use of self-control is that it teaches us to be
masters of our passions"15 ; and that "when the passions urge
us we ought to divert ourselves by other thoughts, until time
and rest shall have entirely calmed the emotion which is in
the blood."18
In that same period Charron declared that "the hin
drance to wisdom which a man must carefully avoid . . .
is the confusion of his passions."17
Outstanding in the eighteenth century is Kant. "The
morality which Kant enforces is of a strong and manly
type."18 "His maxim was sustine et abstine (sustain and
abstain) ; his practice illustrated this."19

He made it clear that in contrast to bodily pleasures
"the more refined enjoyments ... do not wear out but
rather increase the capacity of further enjoyment; and
while they delight they at the same time cultivate.'"0 The
essence of Kant's moral teachings is contained in his state
ment that "first, it is a man's duty to raise himself . . .
out of his animal nature.""
"Perhaps the day will soon come when a disintegrating
civilization will welcome again the Kantian call."1* His is
but a repetition of the call of the ages sent out to floundering
mankind in ever varying form.
"Comte . . . the first really consistent social philoso
pher of the nineteenth century . . . again assigned to as
ceticism its full rights."13
In his positive system of philosophy he explained how
"positivism teaches . . . that sexual purity has a close con
nection with the physical and intellectual improvement of
the individual and of the race."1* As planned by him "edu
cation will make all feel the defects of the sexual impulse,
and will raise a hope of its entire desuetude."15 For "it is
possible to effect the inaction of this impulse, now stimulated
unduly by the brain, and to attain this result with ease."**
In fact "the requirements to which this impulse relates can
be so easily reduced that it is more susceptible of modifica
tion than any other."*7
"To control the sexual impulse efficiently has always
been and ever will be regarded as the highest test of human
wisdom."18 "Philosophers really untrammeled by supersti
tion ought more and more to look upon that impulse as
tending to interfere with the true purpose of the vivifying
fluid" , "which has as its chief purpose the supply to the
blood of a stimulating element, capable of invigorating the
action of all the organs."30 In these words Comte showed
his understanding of the transmutability of the sex force
and of the enormous evolutionary importance of that trans
mutation.

gated his views about "the will to live", by which he prac

tically meant: the will to live a materialistic and worldly
life.
He considered that "the greatest, most important and
most significant phenomenon that the world can show is
. . . the quiet, unobserved life of one who has attained
to the knowledge in consequence of which he denies the will
to live."31 "His body may express the sexual impulse, but
... he desires no sensual gratification under any condi
tion.
"M
"One who has thus attained to the denial of the
will to live is filled with inward joy ... It is a peace that
cannot be shaken ... a state infinitely surpassing every
thing else."33 But "voluntary and complete chastity is the
first step in the denial of the will to live."3*
Once one begins to see the enviable results obtainable
by this denial one cannot but agree with Schopenhauer that
"the sexual impulse appears as a malevolent demon that
strives to pervert, confuse and overthrow everything."35
"A serious historical investigation shows the bond be
tween the ascetic ideal and philosophy ... It was only in
the leading strings of this ideal that philosophy really
learned to make its first steps."3' So said Nietzsche.
"A distaste for the lower gratifications of the senses and
a deliberate judgement that . . . the spiritual faculties
should be cultivated at the expense of the animal propen
sities, have ever been evidenced in the lives of philoso
phers."37 At least the true philosopher has always felt the
necessity of sexual purity, for "he sees therein an optimum
of the conditions of the highest and boldest intellectuality."38
"Wherever philosophers have existed there exists a real
irritation and rancor on their part towards sensuality . . .
There similarly exists a real philosophic affection for the
whole ascetic ideal ... If a philosopher lacks both, then
he is — you may be certain of it — never anything but a
'pseudo'."39
In the true philosopher this ascetic attitude is the out
come of the ingrain, intuitive insight that spiritual wisdom
and cognition of truth are not attainable without the anni
hilation of every remnant of sensuality.

MODERNISTIC SOPHISTRY
"We must regard as accomplices of
the snake all who try to tell us that
happiness is to be found in the range
of bodily impulse."
— Tanner, The Intelligent Man's
Guide Jxx,t40.
Characteristic of the modern mind is its concentration on
materialistic values, its contemptuous attitude towards mo
rality, its juggling with spurious science, its jabbering of
philo-sophistry. In its conceit and its ignorance of spiritual
verities it considers its own ideas superior to the wisdom of
all times. The latter it decries as obsolete, as antiquated and
outworn pedantry of bygone ages, not fitted to the popular
ized new knowledge and the new conditions of the present
day and age. Yet, in so far as sexual morals are concerned,
the central thought about this newness of knowledge and of
conditions is focussed on nothing but the general availability
of means of contraception.1
In reality there is no such thing as obsolescence of the
spiritual essence of philosophy, because this is not subject to
the shifting changes of material and social conditions ; and
there is no out-of-dateness of cosmic principles, or of veri
ties upon which rests the wisdom of the sages and deep
thinkers of all times.
The modernist restricts his field of vision by his negation
of spirit, by limiting his attention to physical laws and to
materialistic mind. This self-willed limitation in itself causes
incompleteness and imperfection, therefore misjudgement
and fallacy in his deductions and opinions. Whereas all
great thinkers always have sought to understand and con
tact spirit ; and it is this underlying element that has given
the deeper value to their writings. The works of the ancient
sages will be quoted and reprinted, and their ideas and
ideals will still be recognized as fundamentally true, long

after the gaudy bubble of modernistic sophistry has burst
and ended its short-lived spectacular existence.
Naturally the ultra-moderns prefer to gather around
those whom they have adopted as their own new prophets,
who cleverly "cloak animal desire in words that make it
seem respectable."2 "They center all their thoughts upon the
pleasures of the body ... in the belief that for its sake man
has come into being"3 ; "they set up for the animal appetite
and openly declare that . . . the chief good is what affords
best entertainment to the senses."4
"The modern world has assumed almost as a matter of
course that the human passions ... by their fulfillment
achieve happiness."5 As one of its apostles asserts: animals
we are and animals we remain, and the path to our regen
eration and happiness, if there be such a path, lies through
our animal nature."8 Certainly, those who choose to remain
animals will always have plenty of reason to doubt the ex
istence of a path to regeneration and happiness, for it can
never be found through the animal nature! "Happiness is
to be found ... in the development of the highest faculties
at the expense of those less noble."7 Moreover, "man is des
tined to be a human being and not an animal; and . . .
to be human he must do away with the animal in him"8, by
restraining his animal impulses.
But "the common cult of the day is that a man should
follow his impulses without restraint."9 "Modern morality
... is no more than a surrender to the wishes and moods
of the individual."10 "Love . . . has been reduced to the
raw realism of a sex experience."11 "A sordid and ignoble
realism offers no resistance to the sexual impulse." "To
the demon of sex . . . the human conscience of our day
answers ... 'Si libet, licet.' ('If you desire
it,
you may')
.
And this self-assertive self-indulgence
is
taught to be the
way to self-realization! But real "self-realization consists
not in the exercise of elemental passions, but in their sub
limation."14
Under the influence of modern sophistry any spiritual
ideal
is
disdainfully derided as
a
puerile superstition; and

has become a subject of ridicule."15 Self-condemnatory, self-

for "the society in which its estimation sinks to a minimum

"The cultural behavior of any human society depends
... on the state of energy into which, as the result of its
sexual regulations, the society has arrived."17 "If we increase
pre-nuptial and post-nuptial sexual opportunity . . . our

must fall from its cultural level. Therefore "the new-fash

MYTHOLOGY
"Take the sword and smite the ser
pent."
— Saint Germain, The Most Holy
Trinosophia,TV,47.
"No mythological system has yet been discovered which
can be entirely separated from all dependence on noble
ideas."1 "Even the most phantastic of myths are expressions
of an inner reality."* "The higher truths are invested in
myths."8
One of the highest truths that is contained in myths of
almost every country is the fact that human passion must
be overcome before spirituality can be developed. "Mytho-
logically expressed, inner development proceeds well if the
hero defeats the dragon."4
In mythology "the dragon is equivalent to the ser
pent."5 For instance "in the Chaldean account of creation
it is a dragon that leads man to sin"6, just as the serpent does
in the biblical presentation. In many myths and legends
"the dragon is merely the idealized serpent."7
Generally "the serpent ... is the treasure-guarding
dragon of the myth."8 "The fruit of a perfect life ... is
guarded by the dragon of man's lower nature"9; it does
not want humanity to obtain that fruit, consisting in in
valuable spiritual unfoldment, because then its own power
over man comes to an end.
Only over the animal's dead body can that treasure be
acquired. Man must slay the dragon by means of his di
vine power of will — which is usually symbolically rep
resented by sword or spear. In some myths the treasure
guarded by the dragon is a spring of magic water, the
source and fountain-head of spiritual refreshment and re
juvenation.
Most of the narratives about treasure-guarding dragons
have come down through the ages in such embellished and

modified forms that the true meaning hardly can be recog
nized. But the fact that the struggle-with-a-dragon episode
occurs in the myths of many nations indicates that it is a
universal symbol for one single truth. This truth is : the nec
essity of subduing the lower nature before acquiring the
spiritual powers, and before attaining union with the higher
nature, with spirit — which is frequently represented in
mythological symbology by the king's daughter or a sleep
ing maiden.
In India "the deed which won Indra his high place was
the feat of slaying the dragon . . . lying on the waters
which Indra thus released."10 "Trita . . . this mighty hero
was likewise the slayer of a dragon."" According to Hindu
tradition "Krishna's first great war was with a mighty ser
pent."1' Highly significant are "the two sculptures of Krish
na suffering and of Krishna triumphant ... In the for
mer15 a youthful figure is shown enfolded by the coils of an
enormous serpent ; in the latter14 Krishna is represented as
trampling upon the serpent's head."18 The highest construc
tive will power in the universe, "Vishnu . . . enabled
Krishna to overcome the serpent."16 Among ancient Bud
dhist sculptures there is "a suggestive representation of Bud
dha as the conqueror of desire . . . seated on a coiled ser
pent."17 "This serpent is in possession of many secrets which
he divulges only to the one who conquers him."18 The secret
of life itself will be revealed when the phallic serpent is
vanquished.
Not only Krishna and Buddha in India, but everywhere
else "all of those called saviors are said to have crushed the
serpent's head, in other words : to have conquered the sen
sual nature."1' It is but natural that the same accomplish
ment has been ascribed to many saints. However "it would
be tedious to enumerate the number of saints who figure as
dragon-slayers.'"0 To give only a single instance, Saint "Mi
chael . . . fought against the dragon . . . And the great
dragon, that old serpent which deceives the whole world,
was cast out."*1
In China "Thienhoang . . . softened the ferocity of

world had been slain."" In Persia "Thraetona smote Azi
Dahaka ('literally : the fiendish snake'83) . . . which Angra
Mainyu created to destroy the world of the good princi
ple." In Assyria "it was with a flaming sword . . . that
Merodach overthrew the dragon."25 In Phoenicia "Cadmus,
drawing his sword, rushed at the dragon . . . which had
been set to guard the fountain of enchanted water, so that
no mortal might quench his thirst there"** — at least not
until having overcome the dragon "which devoured Cad
mus' men as passion still does devour people.""
In ancient Mexico one finds a description of "the ser
pent . . . crushed by the great Teotl."*8 In primitive Mexi
can paintings the figure of a man contending with a dra
gon is often seen29 ; and there are also representations of a
human figure encoiled by a serpent50, undoubtedly symbol
izing humanity in the power of passion.
In Egypt "Typhon is the part of the soul that is subject
to the passions."31 He "was figured under the symbol of a
serpent"3*; and "the destruction of the serpent by Horus
who pierces its head with a spear . . . frequently occurs in
the sculptures."33 It was also in Egypt that Hermes released
the princess Io by overcoming the monster Argus with his
sword34, and that "Anubis is represented as slaying a dra-
JJJ5
gon.
In Grecian mythology "Apollo killed the Python, a mon
strous serpent produced by the earth"38, the embodiment of
humanity's earthly passions. "Perseus . . . went forth to
fight against the dragon of the sea at Joppa"37; "he slew
the monster . . . before celebrating his union with An
dromeda"38, the king's daughter, symbolizing the soul. And
"Hercules had contests with serpents and dragons."39 "His
consummating glory was the conquest of the dragon which
guarded the golden fruit in the garden of the Hesperides."40
Thereby he obtained that fruit, "the true gold of life, con
sisting in the mastery of the passions."41
In Scandinavian countries "the dragon is . . . the
greedy withholder of good things from men ; and the slaying
of a dragon is the crowning achievement of heroes" , of
men as near perfection as the popular mind can imagine.
For example "Thor fought with the Midgard serpent."43

242 The Coiled Serpent
"This serpent . . . seems to have been intended as an em
blem of corruption."44 It "had grown so greatly that it . . .
encompassed all the land"45, presenting a striking picture of
passion's grasp on humanity. In having its greatest hero slay
the serpent "Scandinavian mythology exhibits a clear senti
ment ... on the subject of purity."48
Elsewhere in a renowned epic one reads about "a cer
tain dragon . . . which kept watch over a treasure."47 But
"Beowulf . . . smote the hideous-gleaming foe with his
weighty sword."48 "The horrid earth-dragon was bereft of
life. No longer could the coiled serpent rule over the trea
sure hoards."49 That is to say, after passion had been killed
the spiritual treasure became available for the hero.
England's patron Saint "George drove his sword into the
dragon's throat"50 ; then he "pinned the mighty bulk of the
dragon to the earth with his spear."51 A Sussex legend re
lates how "Saint Leonard saw the dragon Sin . . . and
crushed the monster."5* Celtic lore contains a story about
Gray Lad who "clutched his sword and cut off the dragon's
head
"3,
whereupon "the king's daughter came out to meet
him"54 — that
is,
again, he was united with his spiritual
nature.
In Germany the most famous dragon slayer
is
Siegfried.
With Wotan's sword which he reestablishes "from the stub
born splinters"55 (in other words: with the divine will which
he restores out of human stubbornness and wilfulness), he
kills the dragon that guards the Rhinegold, which "only he
who passion's power forswears and from delights of love for
bears"56 can mould. After killing the dragon, Siegfried un
derstands the language of the woodbird, the voice of intui
tion, which leads him to Brunhilde, his higher self. Clearer
than any other legend does the story of Siegfried show that
the treasure of spiritual consciousness remains
a
useless trin
ket until the truly human entity acquires
it
after slaying the
dragon of sensuality.
Whether in each case clearly expressed or not, all the
myths about dragon-killers picture "the terrible struggles
. . . between man and his personified human passions."57

to the acquisition of incalculable spiritual treasure, is the
tendency to abuse the sex force. That is the dragon or ser
pent which keeps humanity away from an existence of pure
spiritual joy. So long as its urgings are obeyed, man cannot
reach his glorious evolutionary destiny. This serpent must
be seen in its true dimensions ; it must be met and conquered
with adequate power of will. But it often seems as though
"every one considers his serpent an ant."58
"The central object of all self-mastery is first to over
come the serpent"59, or its equivalent, the dragon. "When
the dragon is conquered a valuable treasure, namely an e-
normous psychic energy, is liberated."60 With this energy it
becomes possible to climb toward the highest peaks of hu
man and of superhuman attainment.

LXX
ANCIENT MYSTERIES
"In the mystic rites initiated, life's
best delight I place in chastity alone."
— Euripides, The Cretans, Chorus.
The mystery of the mastery of man over himself, "of sup
pressing the 'old man' and of vitalizing the spiritual princi
ple"1, has been the central idea around which have been
built most of the religious, metaphysical and ritualistic sys
tems. The definite purpose of every such system has always
been to help mankind to lift itself above the miseries and
limitations of merely material existence by teaching it how
to reach up to wider ranges of experience and insight.
In antiquity the Ancient Mysteries offered the way from
exoteric belief toward esoteric wisdom. "The purpose of the
Mysteries in their earlier and unadulterated state was as
suredly a high one, a blending of religious, philosophical and
moral aims."1 They "taught that spiritual illumination was
attained only by bringing the lower nature up to a high
standard of purity"3, and "the initiation in the Mysteries
helped toward the attainment of this object."4
"The ultimate design of the Mysteries, according to
Plato, was to lead ... to a perfect enjoyment of spiritual
good."5 "The neophyte was taught that a conservation of the
life energy and a refusal to expend it in generation . . .
would vitalize and vivify body and mind and give spiritual
powers.'"
A characteristic of the Mysteries was the careful grada
tion of their adherents according to the degree of purifica
tion actually attained. Thus, although all "initiands must
submit to a cathartic process whereby the defilements of
the flesh . . . were removed"7, "the preparatory purifica
tion was of a liberal character, adapted to candidates of
every level of spirituality."8

246 The Coiled Serpent
At successive stages the rules became stricter.
While for the neophyte "purity and chastity were highly
recommended"9, "the initiate was definitely required to
emancipate himself from his passions and to free himself
from the hindrances of the senses."10 And "supreme chastity
was the most glorious crown set before hierophants."11
These grades of development with their ever more strin
gent requirements truly reflect the degrees of evolutionary
attainment as they exist in the human world always and
everywhere. In our days, without the Mysteries to guide the
classification, each person must decide for himself in which
grade he belongs, and work his way to the next higher one.
But he must never forget that in order to reach a higher
existence "chastity is a requisite of the life of an aspirant."11
That great stress was laid in the Mysteries (whether of
Eleusis, of Demeter, Mithra, Orpheus, Isis, or of the Druids)
upon the absolute necessity of sexual purification for those
who were to be entrusted with the secret wisdom, has been
affirmed by many. It has for instance been specifically
stated that "a declaration of virginity was exacted in the
Dionysiac solemnities"13; that "asceticism was . . . the
means by which the true Orphic delivered his soul from the
pollution of the body"14; that "the hierophant and other
ministers of Demeter were celibates"15; that "in Greece
. . . those who took part in certain festivals were obliged
to be continent for some time previously"18 ; and that "the
ancient Druids lived in strict abstinence.""
In the rites of Mithra, "in the second degree the candi
date was . . . sent into subterranean pits to fight the beasts
of lust and passion"18; and in those of Isis, she (Isis) is rep
resented as saying to an aspirant : "You shall . . . deserve
the protection of my divinity by . . . inviolable chastity."19
Also "among the Goths . . . the initiate was prepared to
receive the great lessons of all the Mysteries ... by ab
stinence and chastity."10
Everywhere "the effect of initiation was meant ... to
weaken the empire of the body over the divine portion of
man."11 "Absolute continence . . . nearly every form of
renunciation . . . these never lost in the estimation of an
tiquity their purificatory value."12

Ancient Mysteries 247
Since the Mysteries were the institutions in which these
qualities were practised in order to make the candidate re
ceptive to spiritual knowledge, there was good reason for
the gnostic exhortation : "Cease not to seek day and night,
until you find the purifying Mysteries."13
This same advice still holds for any one who longs for a
fuller understanding of life. But the Mysteries to be looked
for are not now embodied in publicly known brotherhoods
and fraternities. The Ancient Mysteries have disappeared as
readily accessible human organizations, for lack of a suffi
cient number of worthy aspirants. Yet one can still attain
the purpose of the Mysteries, which was "to awaken the
spiritual powers which, surrounded by the flaming ring of
lust and degeneracy, lie asleep within man's soul."" This
purpose can still be attained by not ceasing until one fully
understands the secrets of purification and transmutation of
sex, which not only were the subject of Ancient Mysteries
but which are confirmed by modern investigation.

LXXI
FREEMASONRY
"Freemasonry is . . . the conquest of
the appetites and passions ... a con
tinual warfare of the spiritual against
the material and sensual."
— Pike, Morals and Dogma.xxxiifi^S.
Freemasonry re-echoes in modern times the character of
the Ancient Mysteries. Along with every other ritualistic
movement it may have demonstrated that "ceremonies are
but the unsubstantial flowers of the Toa"1, and that "sym
bols outlast their explanations"1; but in its essence, in its
ideals, it measures up to the highest standard of the Mys
teries.
As of the Mysteries so "the true object of the Masonic
fraternity ... is an attempt to achieve the moral regenera
tion of the human race."3 It recognizes that "in every man
there is a ray . . . which ever struggles upward amid the
obstructions of the passions"4; it teaches that "one law of
our own nature . . . speaking through every nerve and
fibre, every force and element of the moral constitution is
. . . that we must govern our sensual appetites"5, and also
that this is "not the mere enactment of arbitrary will . . .
but the dictate of Infinite Wisdom.'"
Against the growing tendency of a materialistic age to
forget that ceremonies are quite useless when only perfunc
torily performed, the more serious-minded Masons have
"never held . . . that initiation alone sufficed."7 They have
always acknowledged that "the problem of genuine initia
tion consists ... in freeing the ego from the dominion of
the appetites, passions, and the whole lower nature"1, be
cause "without this subordination the clamorous lower ani
mal nature drowns out all higher vibrations.'"
One need not enter deeply into the intricacies of debata
ble interpretations of Masonic symbols to discover that a few

Freemasonry 249
which are generally known contain strong indications of
an intended teaching of sexual purification. The apron for
instance, which should be spotless white, "worn over the
area related to the animal passions . . . signifies the re
generation of the procreative forces."10
Another clear indication lies in the fact that "the Com
pass represents the spiritual . . . and the Square the ma
terial, sensual and baser"11, and in the relative position of
these two in different Masonic degrees. "For the Apprentice
the points of the Compass are beneath the Square"1', indi
cating that "in the man of ignorance the spirit is concealed
and the body and its passions hold dominion."13 "For the
Fellowcraft one point of the Compass is above and one be
neath the Square"14, the interlacing of the two symbols show
ing an attempted but not yet perfected spiritualization. "For
the Master-Mason both points of the Compass are domi
nant and have rule, control and empire over the symbol of
the earthly and the material"15, as a token that it is expected
that "in the Master-Mason's degree matter is subordinated
to spirit."1'
But "what does the symbolism of the Compass and
Square profit a Mason if his sensual appetites and baser
passions . . . domineer over his moral sense, the animal
over the divine, the earthly over the spiritual, both points
of the Compass remaining below the Square?""
A strong hint of an original knowledge of the mechanism
of regeneration, of the 'uncoiling of the serpent'18, is con
tained in the number of Masonic degrees. It can hardly be
accidental that the number of degrees is the same as that of
the vertebrae in the spine. Just as the Mason must rise to
the point of highest attainment through thirty-three Ma
sonic degrees, so the serpent-fire must be raised through the
thirty-three segments of the spinal column before regenera
tion is perfected.
This correspondence seems the more striking when it is
considered that in Masonry "every degree . . . teaches by
its ceremonial as by its instruction that the highest purpose
of life and the highest duty of man are to strive incessantly
and vigorously to win the mastery of that which in him is

spiritual . . . over that which is material and sensual."1'
After all, there can be no question but that this Masonic
ideal, in its logical and practical application, involves the
occult process of regeneration by raising the serpent-fire.
At any rate, the statements quoted from Masonic litera
ture show that in a cornerstone of the Freemasonic structure
lies recorded a recognition of the fact that sexual purifica
tion is a fundamental mandate for spiritual unfoldment.

LXXII
THE REAL ROSICRUCIANS
"The true Rosicrucians bound them
selves to . . . absolute chastity."
— Jenninos, The Rosicrucians,l,v,a6.
Towering above any organization or occupation of ordi
nary humans there seems to have existed, and still may exist,
"a secret society of men possessing superhuman powers"1, a
brotherhood consisting of some of the highest evolved indi
viduals of the race.
Although very few authentic records about them can be
found, there is evidence that they used a super-masonic sym
bolism, carefully kept from crystallizing into a mere cere
mony; a super-alchemic hermetic system, not requir
ing laboratory experiments; a super-occultism, enabling
them to be consciously active on other planes of existence
than the physical ; and a super-science, giving them an un
derstanding of the workings of nature's finest forces back of
all natural phenomena.
"According to this viewpoint the true Rosicrucian Bro
therhood consisted of a limited number of highly developed
adepts . . . who taught the mystery of human regenera
tion through the transmutation of the base elements of
man's lower nature into the gold of spiritual realization."*
"The real objects of those adepts were to remain no longer
slaves to those things supposed to be neccessities, and to rise
superior to . . . sexual degradation."3 "Their principles are
in every way correspondent to the ancient wisdom."4
That their philosophy substantiates the purificatory ideal
presented in this volume can also be seen from a few lines
taken from a tract which is considered to be genuinely Ro
sicrucian : "Instead of governing the sensuous, man became
involved in sensuosity ... He fell from spirit into matter,
and it is now the object of his efforts to regain his former
position ... He is still engaged in the battle of the sen
suous against the spiritual. He wants to become spiritualized

252 The Coiled Serpent
but his body attracts him to the sensuous by a thousand
charms . . . His power of returning depends entirely on
his power to subdue everything that renders obscure his true
inner nature."5 If even the merely sensuous is deemed to ob
scure
it,
how much more must sensuality eclipse man's inner
spiritual nature
!
A
real Rosicrucian has been described as "a person
who by the process of spiritual awakening has attained
a
practical knowledge of the secret significance of the Rose
and the Cross."
6
This secret meaning can be partly under
stood from such statements as: "that flowers blossom by
unfolding has caused them to be chosen as
a
symbol of spir
itual unfoldment"7, and "the cross
is
symbolic of the human
body. When the rose
is
on the cross the two symbols together
signify that the soul of man
is
crucified upon the body."*
With its material ties and tendencies the body holds the
soul in torturous bondage until man rises from physical gen
eration to spiritual regeneration.
A
practical knowledge of this symbolism may well have
been the reason why "the Rosicrucians .
.
.
became re
nowned for the extreme purity of their lives."9
At the present time there are many societies publicly
working under the Rosicrucian name. But when one does

ALCHEMY
"Let him that is desirous of this
knowledge clear his mind from all
passions."
—Espaonet, Hermetic Arcanum^.
"Of all the symbolic systems in which the idea of the re
making or transmutation of the self has been enshrined none
is so complete ... as that of the hermetic philosophers or
spiritual alchemists."1
"By the transmutation of metals the alchemists meant
the conversion of man from a lower to a higher order of ex
istence, from a natural to a spiritual life." The making of
gold was undoubtedly the compelling motive of those al
chemists who were experimentors in primitive chemistry.
But "the true alchemists have nothing to do with ... so
lutions, putrefactions, coagulations or anything of the
kind."3 They were as far from attempting to produce ma
terial goldbricks as freemasons are from building with com
mon bricks and mortar. What they wanted was to "obtain
the pure gold of wisdom from the inferior metals represented
by man's animal passions."4 In hermetic writings there occur
repeatedly such phrases as: "our gold is not in any way
the gold of the multitude, but it is the living gold"5; it is
the "gold . . . with which the wise are enriched, not that
which is coined"9 ; all beings contain in their inmost center
a precious grain of this gold"7; one must "take this pure
spiritual gold . . . Those who labor with dead materials
will obtain nothing that lives."8
The philosophical alchemists used only symbolically the
chemist's utensils and vernacular "in expounding the truth
... to hide it from the unworthy, lest they should be
giving the holy thing to those who think only of indulging
their lustful desires."9 They taught that "alchemy casts off
the sensual man"10, because "sensuality suffocates its
germ."11 Therefore, they said, "we should first study . . .

how to overcome carnal affections."18 "One worthy of this
science must be strictly virtuous, leading a holy life"18, "a
life pure and unsullied by sensual pleasure from birth.""
"Alchemy can be fully understood only by those who
have entered on and are working the philosophic process."15
But even a partial understanding will show that "the cul
mination of the secret work is spiritual perfect man."18
This idea is supported by several clear statements in
hermetic writings. One of the alchemists records: "I gave
myself over to wisdom's smelting furnace as to a fire of
purification, till all my vain desires and the tares of earthly
lust had burnt away ... so that I appeared in spirit as a
pure gold"17 ; while another states : "I have throughout the
whole course of my life kept myself safe and free from sen
suality."18 Still another writes : "I command all my succes
sors to spiritualize their bodies."19.
In regard to the philosopher's stone they remark: "the
hidden stone is not sensuously apprehended, but only known
. . . intellectually"20 ; "it is a great mistake to seek for it
in material and external things."" "Our stone consists of a
body, a soul and a spirit""; in other words, the stone de
notes spiritualized man who consciously and by choice is as
little susceptible to the passions as a stone or mineral is in
its still unawakened consciousness. This interpretation of
the stone elucidates the hermetic command: "be ye trans
muted from dead stones into living philosophical stones."23
About the hermetic elixir of life one writer states that
"this potent elixir was naught but the highly concentrated
energies of man, existing in potency and latency in his re
productive organism."24 Alchemists themselves have said:
"our secret elixir is of a fire-abiding purity"25, and "he who
knows . . . how to make it homogene with imperfect bod
ies knows one of the greatest secrets of nature"26 ; but "who
ever misuses this tincture and does not live an exemplarily
pure life . . . will lose the benefit."27
"The ethical work of alchemy, as of common life, is a
sublimation"28 ; in fact "there is but a single important op
eration in the work; this consists in sublimation"2"; even

"the first step of this process ... is done through subli
mation and purification."30 And that this sublimation actu
ally refers to a transmutation of sexual energy may easily be
deduced from the following quotations.
"The great work is . . . the unification of spirit and
body"31 ; it is "a natural and radical operation in which our
natures are altered perfectly."" "First you must prepare
your seed"35 ; it must be kept pure and be allowed to ripen.
Then "the sage enjoins us to sow the seed in a field which
has been prepared with living fire"34, "a clear transparent
fire not unlike the sun."35 No one can remain uncertain as
to what is meant by this fire after reading that "some call
it spirit."3' The field referred to is "the earth or body"3',
meaning one's own body. "This earth must be weeded of
all foreign elements"38; the body must be purified because
"you must have a good soil"39 for the sublimation of the
seed into spiritual power.
Furthermore one is instructed to "take a living and in
destructible water"40, "which water is called the medium
of the soul."41 "This water is the foundation of our art."4*
"It is a water in the belly of the earth, and the spirit . . .
has mixed itself with it."43 "The sages have described its
power and efficacy as being that of spiritual blood."44 Re
membering that the earth represents the body, these phrases
leave little doubt as to what liquid they refer to. None of
it may be wasted, and it is therefore deemed necessary to
"close well the mouth of the phial."45 For "the body must
drink of its own prepared water, and become ever purer
the more it drinks."4*
You must "understand that the bodily substance must
be conserved ... as being that wherein is the life."47 "You
must let it be your object to solve this substance which the
sages have called the highest natural good."48 "It causes
the body to rise from [spiritual] death to life by being dis
solved first and then sublimated."4' "In this sublimation
our water ascends."50 "In such a natural sublimation or
lifting up there is ... a separation of the pure from the
impure"51 ; "and by such operation . . . the spirit is in
corporated with the body and made one with it."53 Thus
"the body ... is made spiritual by its own water."5*

"All this can be accomplished with our water ... in
its refluent course"54, that is to say when reabsorbed by the
body.58 "Our ultimate or highest secret is by this our water
to make bodies spiritual." "He who knows this . . .

All these pronouncements, most of which have been
taken from old hermetic treatises, distinctly show not only
that "man is the true laboratory of the hermetic art" ,
and that "the genuine alchemist's real object was . . . the
perfection of man"59, but also that in the teachings of the
alchemists the process of transmutation of the sex force
was of primary importance, as it always must be wherever
spiritual regeneration is the aim.

LXXIV
ASTROLOGY
"The heavens . . . eternally witness
the promise of the final redemption of
man from his earthy animal soul."
—Turnbull, Celestial Correspon-
dencesjxfi i .
In its highest aspect "astrology is one of the great secrets of
initiation and occult mysteries."1 To those who are suffi
ciently prepared to understand its true significance astrology
can reveal how, from the infinitesimally small to the infi
nitely great, "every part of the universe acts upon another."*
It can show like nothing else that unity manifests as a uni
versal principle. It can unravel every problem of life in
the cosmos.
In its popularized form however astrology is usually re
duced to a fortune-telling game which any one can play.
This petty personal application stands in the same relation
to impersonal cosmic astrology as the keeping of a house
hold cashbook to the computations of astronomy. Based
on its deeper values "astrology . . was once mighty and
sublime."8 "It was not only a method of divination: it im
plied a religious conception of the world."4 It was "a scien
tific theology."5
In olden days a high standard was set for the profession
of astrology by the general belief that "man must be
purified from all defilement in order to render himself
worthy ... of heavenly things."" "This lofty conception
which was formed of astrology . . . entailed ethical con
sequences of supreme importance."7 As a result the ancient
astrologers "considered the exercise of their profession as a
priesthood. They laid stress on the purity of their morals
and named among the qualities which brought them near
to the divine nature: chastity . . . They led an austere
life. This was the very condition of their power."'

260 The Coiled Serpent
Inherently chastity must ever remain a requisite for an
insight in the real purport of astrology, because in its eso-
tericism it is a purely spiritual science. Any kind of a spirit
ual knowledge can only be acquired when the fire of spirit
burns with a clear flame within the soul ; but "all carnal
desires in some measure pollute this sacred fire"9, and act
as a deterrent on the understanding of esoteric truths.
A simple instance of an astrological influence is that of
the Moon on sexuality. "The Moon is the controller of
human generation."10 The equal periodicity of Moon and
normal menses is an indication of this fact. Furthermore
there is "evidence of the existence of a sex rhythm in the
male as well as in the female, in some way related to the
phases of the Moon."11
There also seems to exist a very definite connection be
tween the Moon's positions and the ascending degrees at
the moments of coition, of fructification and of birth.12 It
is claimed that by an application of this astrological inter
relation "it is possible to arrange the act of generation at
such a time as will ensure the birth of the child at a favor
able moment."13 Herein lies a eugenic secret which a puri
fied humanity some day will be able to apply in calling
into birth a race of supermen. But "before we can do more
than dream of a race of supermen we must first remove the
menace of the half-men"14, who want to turn every bit of
knowledge into selfish use and sense-satisfaction.
For those familiar with astrological lore it may be in
teresting to be reminded of the doctrine that "the zodiacal
signs were first ten."18 That is to say, for a long time "ten
only were known to the profane ; the initiates however knew
them all from the time of the separation of mankind into
sexes."16 Up to that time "Virgo-Scorpio . . . were one
single sign" which included Libra.
Thus in astrology there is an indication that humanity
was once unisexual. And the separation of the sexes was
connected with the division of the one ancient zodiacal
sign (sometimes called the Eagle ) into Virgo (of which
"chastity is the guiding principle" ), Scorpio ("the symbol

of the generative function"19), and Libra (the Balance) of
which the name itself indicates that it holds the balance
between the other two.
Mankind has upset this balance which nature had de
creed and recorded in the stars. And man himself must
restore it. When the disturbing element of sex is overcome
by the race, then the three signs will again become the one,
the Eagle as of old. When the fire of human passion has
been voluntarily extinguished by the will, then out of the
ashes, phoenix-like, the Eagle of spiritual power will arise.
Another astrological indication of the evolutionary need
of sexual purification can be seen in the relation between
Taurus and Scorpio.
"Taurus ... is the symbol of spiritual generative
force"80, which is logically confirmed by the dominion of
this sign over the throat, the source of the creative Word.
Whereas "Scorpio rules the [physical] generative organs."21
Corresponding to the generally acknowledged physiological
relation between the sex organs and the throat, there is a
special relation between Scorpio and Taurus. These signs
are opposites, corroborating the fact that physical genera
tion opposes spiritual regeneration.
Before regeneration can take place the sexual power of
Scorpio must be taken away from this sign and transferred
to Taurus; the generative force of the sex organs must be
transmuted and raised to the throat, where it can find ex
pression in the Word as a manifestation of the mind's
creative power.
The fundamental idea of the transmutation of the sex
force is also confirmed by the planetary rulers, Mars of
Scorpio and Venus of Taurus.
The very symbols of these two planets are significant in
this respect. Both consist of a circle and a cross. "The
cross ... in esoteric astrology is indicative of matter or
the body. The circle . . . denotes perfection or spirit."18
The symbol for Mars has the cross above the circle, "the
material surmounting the spiritual."83 But "in the symbol
for Venus we find significance of the higher forces dominant

over the lower"24, for it has the circle above the cross. Hence
"Venus corresponds to spirit"15, while "Mars is the repre
sentative of the animal soul in man."14 "Mars . . . con
stitutes the seat of desire wherein the spirit is subordinated
to the gratification of the senses.""
"Consistent with progressional law these grosser and
therefore impermanent elements of Mars . . . are convert
ible into the more refined properties of Venus."*8 By puri
fication of the sexual life "Mars will be truly transmuted
into Venus, as experience will teach."19 "Venus cannot act
directly upon the physical plane until the reign of Mars is
over and the passions have changed to . . . the highest
emotions of the spiritual nature."30
All these detailed astrological data may run the risk of
boring the general reader. Yet one more point should be
mentioned on account of its close connection with the sub
ject matter of another chapter.81
In a horoscope the home of Scorpio and of Mars is "the
eighth house, which is generally considered to have a direct
bearing upon death."32 This reaffirms the very close con
nection between sexual activity and death.
It is claimed in occult writings that death was not known
amongst men until the separation of the sexes, until sexual
reproduction began. It was then that Scorpio became mani
fest as a separate sign, and with it appeared death. Con
forming to this idea the tail of the symbol of Scorpio ends
in a tiny arrow, representing the sting of death.
Deadly as the sting and the poison of the scorpion is
the passion of Scorpio and of its ruler Mars. The way to
overcome death is to overcome Scorpio's power over the
sex organs, to overcome sexual passion.
As in the course of time humanity grew ever more ma
terialistic nearly every spiritual phase of astrology was dis
carded. But for the student who begins to rediscover its
concealed verities it can convincingly substantiate that
sexual purification is a requisite on the road toward a higher
humanity.

LXXV
THEOSOPHY
"The sexual relation is ... a thing
to be put aside the moment a person
becomes wise."
— Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine,
H.479-
"Theosophy, the highest summit of thought which the
human mind has reached"1, has existed since the most
ancient times wherever a human consciousness was able to
grasp a knowledge of divine realities. Through the ages it
"has found different expressions in different philosophies
and religions'", which are but cloaked embodiments of the
same eternal truths.
Seeking to give a more direct, unveiled expression to
those truths, "the theosophists of antiquity . . . showed
how the bonds of the senses could be broken and the human
soul set free."3 They showed how each one who so wished
might, while in the physical body, verify some of life's basic
facts and laws. At the same time theosophy always "showed
that a condition of purity, far transcending any popular
ideal of such virtue, was the absolute and all-essential basis
of spiritual insight and attainment."4
The founder of the modern theosophical movement has
not failed to lay enormous stress on the need of sexual purity
for those who would seek an understanding of life's deeper
verities. "It is obvious to any one who knows anything of
Madame Blavatsky's writings and of theosophical teachings
that their whole tendency is toward the destruction of the
sex impulse instead of toward its deification."5

out that this wisdom cannot possibly be obtained unless one
first "kills the passions of the physical, to call to life the
perceptions of the spiritual man."9
She called sexual action "the greatest impediment in
the way of spiritual development."10 And she made it very
clear that "sensual self-gratification involves the immediate
loss of the powers of spiritual discernment."11 For such dis
cernment serene harmony is a prerequisite; and "how can
harmony prevail when the soul is stained and distracted with
the turmoil of the terrestrial desires of the bodily senses?"11
"It is only when ... all the lusts and longings of the flesh
are dead . . . that the union with the higher Self can take
place."13 Since this union can and must be effected during
one's physical life "the passions must first die before the
body does."14
Such are but a few of Blavatsky's numerous unequivocal
pronouncements on the subject of sexual purification. They
found an echo in much of the theosophical literature, es
pecially in the earlier days of the new movement. There
it was emphatically stated that "spiritual culture is only
attainable ... as the demands of the flesh are subordi
nated to the aspirations of the higher nature."15 It was
recognized that "whenever one experiences these higher
moods . . . perfect chastity seems indeed an absolute con
dition of full Self-realization."16 It was realized that "pas
sions . . . dim man's knowledge that he is an immortal
spirit"17, and that therefore "repression of desires is abso
lutely necessary for spiritual progress."18
At an advanced stage of the soul's development, "when
men reach the true spiritual life sex becomes nothing; the
entire forces of their natures are then transmuted into . . .
spiritual energies."19
But before attaining that stage where the sex impulse
is overcome "the war between spirit and matter . . . will
last till man adjusts his outer self to his spiritual nature.
Till then the dark and fierce passions will be at feud with
the divine man."20

Undoubtedly "the animal will be tamed one day"*1,
but not until each one individually undertakes the taming.
Then, "with every effort of the will toward purification . . .
the spiritual entity of man is drawn higher and ever
higher.""
Thus "as to the process of spiritual development the-
osophy teaches . . . the control of fleshly appetites and
desires."*3 It bases this teaching on a unique and profound
system of occult and spiritual science, including an unusual
theory of evolution. Thereby it puts the ideal of purifica
tion on a deeper foundation than can be found anywhere
else.

LXXVI
REBIRTH
"If even the smallest atom of lust has
not been eradicated one will riot leave
behind him these ever recurring exis
tences."
— Buddha, Udanavarga,lll,i8.
"Reincarnation teaches that the soul enters this life not
as a new creation, but after a long course of previous exis
tences on this earth . . . and that the soul is on the way to
future transformations which it is now shaping for itself."1
Thus reincarnation is the belief in "the existence of a per
sistent individual soul passing through different incarna
tions and carrying with it the consequences of its behavior
in previous states."1
This belief "has not only dominated the ingenuous minds
of all the primitive races"3, but at the present day "approxi
mately fifty percent of the world's population can be said
to believe in reincarnation"4, and "it has been accepted by
the greatest philosophers of all countries."8
The main obstacle to a wider acceptance in the Occident
of the idea of reincarnation seems to be that the memory of
"the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost by
us at birth."6 There must be good reasons for this temporary
oblivion. One of these reasons undoubtedly is that the re
membrance of former conditions and relationships, includ
ing those of a sexual nature, would bias one's opinion about
associates with whom ties of the past must be adjusted.
Whatever took place in previous incarnations must have
been digested and transformed into elements of character
which enable one to cope with new experiences. The re
sultant character is the essential thing ; the means by which
it was developed may just as well be forgotten.
However, it is not considered impossible to recover the
seemingly vanished memory of "the immense fund of ex
perience gathered through countless ages ... a fund ac

cessible to us only when the tumult and stir of the bodily
senses is stilled."7 From the subconsciousness which "is the
abode of everything that is latent"8, "the memory of the
incarnating ego . . . can be recalled through the action
of the . . . regenerative force.'" This force can only be
come active "by a conservation of the life energy and a
refusal to expend it in generation"10, or in any sexual act.
"When one's being is thus purified there arises before him
the firm imperishable memory of his past experiences"11,
for "by the observance of the rules of purification . . . one
obtains the faculty of remembering former births."1*
Uncontrolled psychic visions, which are supposed to be
connected with previous incarnations, may occasionally be
had by an unpurified sensitive ; but such negatively re
ceived impressions can never be accepted as in any way
dependable. Purification of the sexual life clearly is con
sidered to be an ineluctable requisite for a reliable memory
of past births.
"The doctrine of rebirth . . . untangles the knotty
problems of life simply and grandly"" — in the realm of
sex as well as in other spheres of being.
For instance "that a child brings along into the world
germs of sexual activity"14 is seen as but the natural result
of an artificially strengthened sexual impulse in former
existences. Where a craving for sexual gratification has been
nurtured in the past it will be flagrant in the present. Re
versely, to the extent that such inclination is subdued will
it lose its power in subsequent incarnations, and so much
easier will be the ultimate victory over sensuality — a vic
tory that is evolutionarily imperative.
"All our successive incarnations are intended to improve
the conditions for the realization of our highest endeavors,
which are hindered and thwarted by our carnal passions."15
"Only by repeated incarnations the soul is able to realize the
futility of the search for happiness and satisfaction in ma
terial things."16 "The value of reincarnation lies in the fact
that attempts to improve life are strengthened in succeeding
incarnations until final perfection is reached."17 "As long
as we are not pure enough ... we must be born over and

over again, and the degree of our impurity determines what
these births shall be."18
"Every lower impulse and craving is pulling . . .
toward rebirth upon the earth."18 And as long as that at
traction toward physical existence necessitates rebirth "each
soul enters the world for a certain and definite purpose,
and occupies the sex which will best enable it to fulfill that
purpose."20
Reincarnationists are convinced that those who are
here today will be a part of a future humanity. Hence they
must see that the way to prepare a better future race, and
therewith a better world in which to reincarnate, is to en
noble and purify the present one — beginning with that
little portion of it over which they have full control, namely :
with themselves.
Gradually the human entity will learn to overcome the
physical attractions and temptations and "will be born . . .
with a consciousness which refuses to let him go wrong."11
In the end, "through the purification of his moral character
he will attain deliverance"1* from the necessity of rebirth
on the physical plane, and be free to manifest in fully
awakened, unbroken awareness in this or in other worlds.
The sooner one begins to purify his nature from sensual
inclinations, the sooner will freedom from compulsory in
carnation be attained, and the sooner will existence become
possible on a plane where death and suffering are unknown.

LXXVII
RETRIBUTION
"At least half the world's misery is
in some way . . . connected with the
sexual sphere."
— Robinson, Sexual Problems of
To day, in.
Law links effect to cause in every manifestation of nature.
Of many physical phenomena the cause has been dis
covered by science. Where a cause is still unknown science
does not deny its existence but tries to find it. In its own
dominion physical science asserts that nothing can take
place without a definite cause.
In the sphere of human life students of metaphysical
science have recognized that also in individual existence
"whatever arises is inevitably the effect of a previous cause"1,
and that moreover the cause must have been set up by the
same individual whom the effect affects. In this way only
can it be true that "all that befalls man befalls him justly"1 ;
thus only can it be that justice rules the world. But "to
people delighting in desire the law of causality . . . will
ever be a matter difficult to understand."8
Looking at a single life this law of causality — or of
retribution or, as it is often called, of karma — is not always
apparent. Seemingly without due cause some people's path
is full of suffering, while with others good fortune abides;
and actions, baneful as well as worthy, often seem to remain
without any rebounding effect. Only when rebirth is taken
into account* the law of retribution with its infallible jus
tice becomes intelligible. Combined with the law of retri
bution "the doctrine of reincarnation accounts for the in
equality observable in the lives of men on earth, giving a
logical reason for the same, and establishing the fact of
universal and ultimate justice accountable for on no other
grounds."5 "The believers in karma and reincarnation alone

dimly perceive that the whole secret of life is in the un
broken series of its manifestations."6
After all, "the belief that no act, whether good or bad,
can be lost is only the same belief in the moral world which
our belief in the preservation of force is in the physical
world. Nothing can be lost."7
As long as life brings pleasant experiences these are
readily enough accepted as the natural result of personal
merit, as a compensation to which the person — usually for
no noticeable reason — feels entitled. But when misery
comes along, responsibility for its cause is but rarely ac
knowledged.
Only the law of retribution can lucidly explain how all
human suffering is caused by man himself, and how the
greatest misery results from his abuse of sex. "There can be
no doubt that abuse of the sexual function is responsible for
much moral, mental and physical suffering."8
In whatever form misfortune may strike, it is necessarily
self-attracted. "The origin of every evil ... is in human
action"8, and thought. "Its origin rests entirely with reason
ing man who dissociates himself from nature."10
"All inharmony, tribulation and despair . . . are the
direct result of violations of laws of being."11 And "by far
the greater part is the result of the wilful refusal to obey
the moral law."1' "Each violation of this law becomes a
force in the direction opposite to that toward which evolu
tion is working"18, so that instead of helping toward re
generation it drags down toward degeneration. "Human
misery is ... an expression of degeneration and a symp
tom of spiritual decay."14 All "impurity . . . leads down
ward to decay"15, if not immediately in the same life on
earth then in another incarnation.
According to those who accept reincarnation as a fact
the unconsummated effects of whatever man has caused will
meet him when he comes to live on earth again. The human
entity "enters the embryonic stage . . . with its doom pro
nounced by itself."16 It enters a male or a female body
according to the experiences which it has to go through. It
is automatically attracted to such parents as can supply

hereditary elements of body and of mental equipment in
accord with its own character. It is attracted to such sur
roundings as will justly provide what it deserves and needs ;
and to persons with whom ties were made in the past that
will have to be adjusted — the strongest and most un
pleasant of such ties having originated in sexual affairs.
Every sexual act like every other act must cause some
future reaction. And since most sexual acts, except those
for propagation, are in discord with nature, the reaction
comes as a rule in the form of misery. For "we cannot
interfere with the normal course of nature without some
consequent evil result.""
"The mission of the reproductive energy is to secure the
continuance of the human race . . . The consequences
of every transgression will be serious in the highest degree."18
Wasting the life force is bound to result in a later lack of
that force, in an incarnation of physical invalidity, of mental
limitation, or in one that is cut short. Irresponsibility in
spreading venereal disease may bring rebirth in a prenatally
tainted body, with congenital and lingering ailments. In
considerate procreation is likely to bring sickliness or loss of
children and painful childbirth. Contributing to some one
else's delinquency must cause one's own future degenera
tion. For every sexual error one must somehow atone.
Abuse of sex is at the very root of woeful retribution.
"The curse of karma was called down ... as the result
of wasting the life essence for personal gratification."1' To
this alone must be attributed "the evil propensities — the
curse of a thousand ages of animality — with which our
race is afflicted."10 "By just retribution . . . our flesh now
torments us by insubordination"11 ; and this it will continue
to do until we discontinue every form of sexual abuse.21
Self-evidently sex purification will free us from the over-
stimulated driving force of the sexual impulse ; and it will
help to build a future free from all the misery to which
most sexual acts give cause. Already "the very longing
to realize the spiritual ideal in reproduction ... of itself
tends to lessen suffering."23

LXXVIII
PSYCHISM
"The unpurified person . . . can a-
rouse only the lower psychic forces."
— Pryse, The Apocalypse Unsealed,
21.
"With our physical senses alone at our command none of
us can hope to reach beyond gross matter"1, "which veils
our internal vision and . . . muffles our internal hearing.'"
But "there are certain faculties latent within the con
stitution of man which if they become developed, call a
higher scale of internal senses into activity, and these may
enable him ... to hear, see, taste and smell things which
far surpass the powers of perception of the external senses."3
"In every human being there are such latent faculties by
means of which he may acquire for himself knowledge of
the higher worlds"4, and by which he may prove to his own
satisfaction that "the supernatural is only the natural in an
extraordinary grade."5
Unfortunately "the development of these interior senses
is neglected almost to atrophy."6 And the capacity to re
spond to spiritual vibrations has almost entirely been lost as
a result of the sexual perversions of the race.7 "He who has
become corrupted does not easily rise to the sight of true
beauty . . . He rushes on to enjoy and beget . . . and is
not even ashamed of pursuing pleasure in violation of
nature."8 Every chance for the development of a safe and
reliable higher psychism is thereby lost, because "the soul
suffocated with the body and with lust cannot see any
spiritual things."9 "The real world ... is not to be entered
by those whom the body binds to its caprices."10
"The connection between spiritual seership and the
physiological purity of the seer"11 is of paramount impor
tance. Only "increasing control of the lower centers . . .
permits the emergence of the higher transcendental per
ceptions."11

276 The Coiled Serpent
Therefore, "for the beholding of the hidden things shalt
thou forsake . . . the things of the flesh."13
"Spiritual awakening is necessarily accompanied by
more or less psychic development."14 But psychic develop
ment is by no means a sign of spiritual awakening.
A low-grade, unreliable and unsafe form of psychism is
possible even without the slightest touch of spirituality.
Impressions of a superphysical nature are sometimes nega
tively received by so-called sensitives. But such psychism is
"destructive to the unpurified . . . who may succeed in
arousing it."15 "The mere dabbler . . . will only degrade
his intellect with the puerilities of psychism and become
the prey of the misleading influences of the phantasmal
worlds."14 The road to the psychopathic ward is crowded
with unpurified, unspiritualized sensitives.
The development of psychism can never be recom
mended. It should not be sought, but come as the natural
concomitant of pure spiritual growth. Where a tendency
to psychism appears while purity is imperfect, that ten
dency should be counteracted and entirely overcome in
order to prevent the almost unavoidable deteriorating results
on mind and morals.
Psychism is safe only after the casting out of every
element that might still respond to sensual vibrations. It is
safe only when we can assimilate the influence of the purest
spiritual forces. And "we can receive this influence only
when we liberate ourselves . . from carnal occupation."
At the present time, particularly amongst students of
metaphysics and of the semi-occult, theories are rampant
to the effect that unreproductive coition in certain ways
can give spiritual upliftment. Mistaking emotional exuber
ance for spirituality, it is erroneously thought that in the
sexual union a spiritual ecstasy can be experienced.
No greater and more dangerous fallacy could be in
vented to beguile the students. No more specious and tempt
ing excuse could be presented for whatever sensual tenden
cies may be residual in their nature. No act of self-indul
gence can awaken any spiritual response. "Under no circum

growth."18 To teach the opposite is a spiritual perversion.
Every attempt to link a physical expression of the lower
centers with superphysical experiences can at most lead to
the development of a psychism of a deceptive and dangerous
order.
Carnal expression of any kind whatsoever debases the
forces of psychism which are tenable and valuable only in
"those who . . . find these forces awakened within them
by the very purity of their nature and by the intensity of
their aspiration for the spiritual life."19
Pure psychism calls for sexual purity.

MAGIC
"Whoever wants to practise the art
of magic . . . should leave carnal
affections and material passions."
— Aorippa, Occult PhilosophyJXljii,
350-
Where science ends magic begins. "Magical operations
are the exercise of a power which is . . . superior to the
ordinary forces of nature"1 — that is to say to the objective
forces which are used by physical science. Magic deals with
a subjective power latent within man.
"The power magical . . . sleeps in man since the
knowledge of the apple was assimilated ; and so long as this
knowledge dominates, the noble magical power is lying
dormant."1 What has here been called the knowledge of
the apple quite evidently refers to the abuse of sex for self-
gratification. Since that abuse is said to keep the power of
magic in abeyance, it follows that the functioning of "this
power is achieved through continence."3 At least "conti
nence is regarded as one of the conditions required for the
successful carrying out of magical operations."4
Certainly "not without reason have the magicians in
all lands and times insisted on chastity."5 For the magus
has to employ forces which nature usually keeps hidden;
and "there is no other way of penetrating into the deeper
secrets of nature than the development of the higher nature
of man.'" Hence in every respect "the theurgist must im
peratively be one of high morality."7 He "must be impas
sable and chaste . . . Most important is the attainment
of this rare preeminence."8
Magic is the performance of the miraculous, and only
an "abstemious mode of living can produce such an acute-
ness of the senses that the greatest and most remarkable
things may be performed."9 "In order to work miracles we
must be . . . above all passions."10 Therefore "it was a

very excellent opinion of the ancient magicians that we
ought to . . . decline the impulses of the flesh."11
Everywhere "the first lesson of one who would become
a magus is self-mastery."11 And always "sexual passion . . .
is categorically forbidden to the magus."13 In fact it has
been held that in itself "to obtain command over the serpent
is to become a magus.""
The statements made so far refer particularly to white
magic, so called in contradistinction of black, magic or
sorcery.
White magic works impersonally with the powers of
the spirit to help and to uplift others — never for the pro
motion of selfish interests, never in any way for the aggran
dizement of the personality. But such unselfish "spiritual
operations require the greatest purity."15 For "only when
man has outgrown his animality can his organism become a
fit instrument for the exercise of spiritual powers."16 "There
fore the white magician . . . seeks to transmute the poles
of the beast within himself into higher and finer qualities.""
Every attempt to utilize spiritual powers to indulge the
personality constitutes black magic. Whether the purpose
be to satisfy feelings of hatred and revenge by hurting others,
or to acquire private benefits in the form of health or pros
perity or other wish-fulfillments — it is far from white magic
and must be classed with the black art. This takes in the
widespread selfish use of affirmations, of concentration and
suggestion. Though not always decidedly evil, such use of
the spiritual powers of unity for the sake of the separated
self is against natural law ; and it is dangerous, if only be
cause it reinforces self-centeredness and thereby retards
one's spiritual evolution which calls for the gradual dissolu
tion of the feeling of separateness.
Except for the lowest forms of sorcery sexual purity has
long been considered a necessary asset for almost any kind
of magical performance.
Even many "savages are perfectly well aware how valu
able sexual continence is ... to acquire the aptitude for
abnormal powers."18 "Almost universal among primitive

peoples are certain forms of ascetic practices inspired by
motives magical.18 Thus "we hear of celibate wizards and
of virgin witches.""'
In regard to the office of medicine-man, which is found
among aborigines in every part of the globe, "continence was
often required throughout the whole novitiate of individuals
in training for the office."11 And afterwards in their healing
work stress was laid not only on their own continence. "Yet
more surprising . . . was their caution of not admitting
polluted persons to visit any of the patients, lest the defile
ment should retard the cure."1* The emanations of any one
who shortly before had had sexual intercourse were con
sidered to be detrimental to the convalescent.
In the magical tradition of all ages it has been generally
surmised that "the chaste individual was the abode of super
natural power."13 Also that sexual purity insured protection
against evil influences, that for instance "a person cannot
be bewitched ... if he has extinguished all the surgings of
carnal concupiscence."" And it was believed that "sexual
intercourse . . . removed the magical efficacy of a
charm"25, which otherwise would exert a shielding power.
So, in the study of magic lore as in that of so many
other subjects one comes across much evidence that sexual
purity has always been held to be of enormous value in
many ways. Some of those subjects may seem of little prac
tical value, because hardly any one cares to become either
a magician or a psychic or a yogi or a mystic. Yet each
subject contributes its little share to the central idea that
there exists an innate power in chastity.
In the course of evolution magic powers beyond present
humanity's wildest dreams are waiting to be developed.
But as long as one remains subject to the slightest stir of
self and of sex the faculty to use such powers to any mea
surable extent would be as injurious and calamitous as a
sharp dagger in the hands of a little child. It is therefore
fortunate that "the schools of white magic conceal these
powers from man until through purification and unfoldment
he gains the proper incentive for using them."*

YOGA
"Yoga manuals know the symbol of
the serpent which the individual has
to overcome in order to acquire val
uable powers."
— Silberer, Problems of Mysticism,
111,277.
Since immemorial ages India has known and taught
"the science of Yoga, the way by which a man may hasten
his evolution and expand his consciousness."1 To this end
"the Yoga philosophy insists strongly on certain spiritual
exercises by which the soul may best obtain and maintain
peace and quietness."1
Peace and serenity and the elimination of undesirable
and disturbing influences seem even more necessary in Yoga
than in other spiritualizing method*. Therefore "the study
of Yoga is impossible in the scattered condition of thoughts,
desires and feelings amidst which an ordinary person lives."3
In the hectic existence of the whole Western world there
is practically no chance for an effective following of Yoga
practices. Yoga was originated in and for the East, not for
the West. Although the final goal of spiritualization is
everywhere the same, the methods of approach are some
what different under differing racial conditions as well as for
different individuals. A rule however which all methods
have been shown to have in common is that of perfect
chastity, essential as it is for the transmutation of the
generative force.
Attempts to westernize the Yoga teachings have led to
simplified adaptations which not only are usually ineffective,
but which become dangerous whenever they fail to insist
on an absolute cessation of physical indulgences. Any
one attracted to Yoga must well consider that "it is a very
dangerous thing to adventure in this path without the
moral foundation of perfect self-control."4 "Without it
the practice of Yoga . . . may lead to insanity."5

Yoga 283
The five known systems of Yoga may vary in their
methods of self-discipline, adjusted as these are to different
psychological types; but "the opening of a higher con
sciousness is the aim of all Yogas."0 And "for all, the sub
dual of the senses ... is an essential prerequisite."7 So
all-important is this requirement that sometimes particu
larly "this, the firm holding back of the senses, is what is
called Yoga."8 "The general drift of Yoga remains always
the same . . . It is to serve as a discipline for subduing the
passions."9 When this discipline is omitted there can be no
question of Yoga, nor of spiritualization or of illumination.
Not only do the "Yogis know that sex energy must be
conserved and used for the development of body and mind
instead of being dissipated."10 They also realize that "the
greatest impediment to the acquirement of Yoga powers is
. . . sexual action."11 Therefore "as a first step the student
is trained and tested by the command . . . that continence
must be made the basis of life."12 Right from the beginning
"there must be perfect chastity in thought, word and
deed."13
Only "if lust ceases . . . worldly bondage will cease."14
Then "by absence of all self-indulgence . . . pure spiritual
being can be attained."15 But first, when "the intelligence
has ceased to take pleasure in the things of sense, and there
fore has seen the truth"16, "the perfection of the powers of
the bodily vesture comes about through the wearing away
of impurities."17 Thereupon "from steadfastly following
Yoga . . . comes illumination."18 And "if a person ... is
constantly freed from the senses the infinite, supreme Yoga
is perfectly produced."19
Like mysticism, and like every other system for spirit
ual development, Yoga has often led to extreme one-sid-
edness. Many of the so-called yogis are the outcome of
lopsided Yoga practices. Their demonstration of freakish
physical body-control obtained by tremendous will power,
or their performances of psychic or magical tricks resulting
from exceptional concentration — these do not in any way
exemplify the spiritualizing force of Yoga. In such cases

The Coiled Serpent
concentration and body-control, which to some extent be
long to the genuine means of a higher development, have
been overemphasized and made the end of attainment.
Even among those yogis who show a semblance of spirit
uality a distracting one-sidedness frequently occurs. Drop
ping their interest in everything in this world, their purpose
often becomes exclusively self-attainment ; whereas true
spiritualization is inseparable from a longing and an effort
to be of greater service to humanity. Such yogis seek union
with the cosmic parent-life by trying to go back to foetal
existence, where with eyes closed to the world and without
effort they can feel to be one with Mother Nature, leaving
everything to her. In other words, they seek a passive one
ness of dependence. Whereas evolution's aim is an active
oneness of equality, resulting from a wide-awake use of the
mind combined with a laborious acquisition of the spiritual
powers which will gradually enable one to become the Fa
ther's competent assistant and co-worker.
Where the Occident has become blinded to the neces
sity — and even to the existence — of spiritual development,
the Orient has neglected the exercise of the concrete mind.
For this reason Yoga, too, generally does not fulfill the re
quirements of a balanced evolutionary growth.
However, this is not the place for a critical study of
Yoga's shortcomings. The present point of interest is only
that the first requirement of Yoga, as of every system which
serves to make spiritual development possible, whether it
be for the East or for the West, is sexual purification. "One
who wants to become a perfect yogi must give up the sex
idea."20

OCCULTISM
"All sexual intercourse is forbidden
in practical occultism."
— Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine,
111,537-
On the beach of the unfathomable ocean of life we are all
playing our games or absorbed in our favorite pastimes.
Proudly the athlete struts along the boardwalk, showing
off his inflated muscles.
Along the water's rim the scientist proceeds, exclusively
intent upon investigation of whatever the ocean has cast
ashore and brought within his reach.
Sun-shaded sits the artist, registering impressions of what
he observes around him and what is inspired to him.
Outstretched lies the philosopher, speculating upon the
being of sea and sky and land and living creatures and their
interrelation.
Forgetful of surroundings the religionist in devotional
attitude bows his head, adoring the unknown force that
manifests in nature's magnitude.
On the sand within the tidal strip the psychic rests in
negative receptiveness, letting the waves touch him when
ever the flow comes up.
The magician is attracting wide attention trying to make
the tide recede by strange manipulations and a mighty ex
ercise of will.
The mystic, after meditative contemplation, so longs for
a momentary merging with the ocean of the one life that he
dips into it ; but not knowing how to swim he is soon rolled
back upon the shore again.
When the waters are untroubled, the surf unstirred by
wind, the yogi dives and serenely swims a while in the sama-
dhic sea.
Looking and watching over all from an elevated point
stands the occultist. He is the life-guard of this beach. He

is here to help others, ready to render aid whenever called
upon. He knows the ocean well, has thoroughly explored it
and is at home in it ; with eyes unclosed he can go down as
deep and stay down as long as he may wish. He observes
more, knows more, and can do more than any of the others.
Each of the others is but an incomplete expression of
single aspects of the occultist. He is the synthesis of all the
others. He exemplifies a progressive stage of balanced evolu
tionary growth toward superhumanity.
The designation of occultist is frequently misapplied to
dabblers in theurgic and pseudo-occult crafts, or to students
of occultism who are still as far from being occultists as a
kindergarten pupil is from a doctorate.
The accomplished occultist is a highly and harmoniously
evolved human being in whom all faculties of body and of
soul can be used at will. He has risen above the danger of
clinging tenaciously to any one-sided form of development ;
for him all-round perfection is the chosen goal.
Abundant physical vigor, scientific understanding, artis
tic inspiration, philosophic speculation, religious adoration,
intuitive receptivity, mystic contemplation, yogic concen
tration, magic will-power, plus other still more wonderful
abilities are all acquired by the successful occultist — each
to an extent beyond the comprehension of those who seek
to specialize in any single faculty.
The true occultist does not use any of his attainments
for the worldly benefit of the personality, nor to enhance
its glamor. He brings all the powers of the soul into expres
sion in the personality for the sake of helping others. And by
the growing impersonality of his being, which is of the very
character of spirit, he gains access to the source from which
all power springs.
To become an occultist, then, is the acme of human at
tainment. "But occultism gives no prospect of cheaply and
immediately gained infinitude of wisdom."1 In the first place
"he who would become an occult student . . . must con
tinually increase his moral strength, his inner purity.'" "The
laws of attainment demand purity of life."8 "Whoever

wishes to come to the supreme state of the soul . . . must
purify his mind and body from all passions."4 For this
reason "all training in occultism has asceticism for its key
note."5
An essential requirement is knowledge, not only of phys
ical science but of the science of all superphysical laws as
well. And in order to be able to acquire it the student must
"lead the life necessary for the acquisition of such know
ledge."6 "The study is of no avail unless the spiritual intui
tion is developed by the purification of desire.'" "The sanc
tuary of esoteric science is closed to the frivolous ... by
the law of their own nature."8 Only "by way of purifica
tion . . . can the soul acquire the perfect knowledge of all
things knowable."8 Therefore "the passions . . . are not to
be indulged in by him who seeks to know."10 He alone "who
disaccustoms himself to concupiscence makes his heart ac
quainted with secrets"11, with those deep secrets of nature
which it would be dangerous to divulge to any one remain
ing ever so slightly sensual or selfish.
It is "the reward of the conqueror who . . . vanquishes
the foes of his own nature . . . that he has imparted to
him the secret knowledge."1'
Not until knowledge has thus been acquired is it safe to
attempt the development of any occult powers.
"If men knew the divine powers which are dormant in
their constitution, and were to pay attention to their devel
opment instead of wasting all their energies upon the trifling
affairs of their external existence"13, then there would soon
be many competent occultists.
But men either do not know and do not even want to
know about such powers, or if they know about these they
are reluctant to believe that "occult science allows not a
shadow of self-indulgence."14 But "woe to those who . . .
dabble in any form of occult science without first overcom
ing the more important faults of their lower nature."15
"Carnal passion . . . suppresses the faculties of the
soul."16 Hence the insistent demand that the disciple of oc

lust will feel the almost immediate result of being dragged
from the impersonal divine state down to the lower plane
of matter."18
"The sooner the animal sexual affinities are given up
. . . the sooner will come the manifestation of the higher
occult powers."19 Then only can harmonious evolutionary
progress be made; and then "the consciousness of power,
in itself the most exquisite joy, is unceasingly gratified in
the progress upwards."20 Infinite power, to be impersonally,
unselfishly, constructively used, will then eventually become
available. Is such a prize not worth the sacrifice of the per

THE PATH OF PERFECTION
"Having conquered the desires of the
outer senses . . . prepare now to en
ter upon the path."
— Collins, Light on the Pathji,n,
Slowly winding to the top of the Mountain of Perfection
leads the road of gradual evolution. From this road the
top is rarely visible, the view being cut off by mystifying
thickets and by luxurious groves which tempt the wanderer
to pause and straggle and to forget the goal. But occasion
ally a glimpse is caught, and a jubilant cry is heard from
those who took a shortcut to the summit.
The shortcut is the steep and narrow path which is
known to many but which few are inclined to follow. It is
"the path which leads from sense to soul"1, the straight
"way to the land concealed by the dazzling phantasmagoric
show of the senses"2, "the short though difficult way by
which man evolves more rapidly than in the ordinary course
of human evolution."'
But only "he may tread that path who dares to declare
war on desire."4 "To enter the path . . . one must crucify
the lusts of the flesh."5
Throughout the centuries the short path has been
known. All "the great faiths have taught . . . that in a
certain personal austerity was a gate to the eternal way."'
"That way, the highest way, goes he who shuts the door
to all his senses."7
"This path Hermes, indeed, described."8 "It is the path
that leads to truth . . . difficult to tread for soul while
still in body"9 ; "but it is possible for one who has the mind
to free himself from passion."10
It is "that path . . . which the teachers of the Veda
call never failing ; the path which persons of conquered pas

sions enter, and desirous of knowing which they live the life
of purity."11
It is the path, the Way, of the Taoist. "He who treads
the Way is a superior man"1*; and "the superior man
guards against lust."13
It is the Buddhist's "noble eightfold path . . . which
leads to peace of mind, to the higher wisdom, to full en
lightenment."14 "The wise are those who . . . follow the
noble path and avoid the pools of lust."18
It is the path of holiness of which the Bible states that
"the unclean shall not pass over it."1'
It is the path of the Mohammedan Sufis, by whom "the
celibate ideal . . . was realized as invaluable for all who
sought to follow the mystic way."17 Only "when cleansed
from the lusts of the flesh the soul could enter on the path."1*
For mystics everywhere it is the path of "purification,
illumination and perfection, the three great stages of the
ascent."1' "The first stage is known as the purgative life,
the stage of purification from the fetters of sensuality.
"1•
"The end of the path is attained ... by transmutation."11
To modern students of metaphysics it is the path which,
through probation and discipleship, leads to initiation.
"The pilgrim who ventures upon it is made first to . . .
shut out every human passion."" During the probationary
stage "the wish to be emancipated from the thraldom of
the senses should be ever present in the mind."18 "If the
higher levels of spiritual attainment are to be reached the
disciple must be prepared to sacrifice and transcend the
desires of the body." "The desire for sensual gratification
must be crushed"15 before initiation can be reached; for
"initiation is . . . the victory of the spirit over the animal
nature of man."16 "Whosoever is the slave of his passions
. . . can never be initiated."*7
The opportunity to choose the shortcut is the same for
all.
The same for all also is the universal rule that mastery
of the sex force forms the initial step on that path of quick
ened evolution. "The victor's crown is only for him who
. . . conquers the demon of lust."18

LXXXIII
TESTS AND TEMPTATIONS
"Too weak is the temptation for one
whose soul to nobler things ajpires
than sensual desires."
— Lonofellow, Christus,l,ii,a.
Every temptation is a test of moral strength. At every
stage of evolutionary growth the law of that growth causes
temptations to be erected on the pathway of the soul. Lack
ing the strength to overcome these natural obstructions one
cannot pass on to the next lap of the road.
Since "life is a continual battle between man's spiritual
aspirations and the demands of animal impulses"1, "the
first temptation which meets every one on the road is the
hunger of the lower qualities."1 And in ever subtler ways
the animal proclivities are tested to the end. Even "the
highest degree of perfection attainable by man is no security
against the assaults of temptation."3
At a comparatively advanced stage one's vision of the
requirements of attainment may be obscured by the allure
of the false teaching that in physical sex expression there is
"mystical inwardness" and that it can be "the means to a
great spiritual fulfillment." Many who are already far on
the road of spiritual unfoldment fail to perceive the spe-
ciousness of such sophistry. But "the guardians of nature's
secrets ... let none pass until they are furnished with the
signs and passwords of perfect purity."4
The greatest strength by which to pass through tests
and to overcome temptations is that of purity. Not the
negative purity of innocence caused by ignorance, but the
positive purity based on knowledge and power of the will.
Dissatisfaction and dejection normally follow each fail
ure to overcome an enticement. But "when one has con
quered temptation . . . one finds oneself in a state of peace
and satisfaction which may well be called happiness"5 ; then
there is elation over growing strength.

294 The Coiled Serpent
It is sometimes claimed that temptations should be
sought because they serve to increase one's moral strength.
But this is an obvious error. Strength must be gathered be
tween successive tests, just as knowledge is gathered in
schools between examinations. To submit to one examina
tion after another without preparatory study would cer
tainly be abnormal. Not less abnormal is it to seek one
excitement and temptation after another without inter
vening effort to develop resistant strength.
Tests of one's moral stamina need never intentionally be
sought. When the soul seems ready to pass another mile
stone on the evolutionary road, then life itself applies the
necessary test according to one's stage. And no one can pass
unto another section of that road who is not thoroughly
prepared. Nor can one ever pass by shirking the test.
The individual task is to prepare for tests by developing
greater moral strength, by obviating every weakness of char
acter. And since above all else "passion . . . manifests the
weakness of man"6, the first thing to be eliminated is pas
sion.
Quite naturally the tests become more difficult as
strength grows.
Those who approach the final stages of the road have
"to be tempted in a thousand various ways so as to draw
out the whole of their inner nature."7 Then "if the candi
date has a latent lust for sensual gratification of any kind,
the germ is almost sure to sprout."8 However, "it is in his
own interest that his character and attributes are being test
ed"9 ; for "until he has been tested to the utmost none may
know what hidden weakness fingers in him."10 And no
weakness may remain in those who seek admission to the
temple of purely spiritual joy to which the road finally leads.
This thought is tersely expressed in the saying that "Sa
tan is the doorkeeper of the temple . . . He holds the keys
of the sanctuary, that no one may enter therein save the
anointed."11 By tempting every one who approaches the
gate that leads to spiritual attainment, he sees to it that only
those pass through who have successfully proved their pu
rity and inner strength.

Tests and Temptations 295
For the same purpose in ancient Egypt "the snake Bai
appears to have been figured ... as guardian of the door
ways leading to chambers which represent the mansions of
heaven.""
Again the same idea is forcefully dramatized in the
story of Parsifal, who symbolizes the human soul. He was
tested by Klingsor's seductive agents, the Flowermaidens
and Kundry. Said Klingsor, the arch-temptor, to Parsifal :
"Into my power thou'lt fall when pureness has departed."18
Only by proving that there was no weakness left within him
which could make him fall for any temptation did Parsifal
gain access to the sublime spiritual precinct of the Grail.
It is the same testing that has been so picturesquely told
in The Pilgrim's Progress where, for instance, the pilgrim
learned that after playing with treasure "Passion . . . had
nothing left him but rags."14 It forms the subject matter of
The Sorrows of Satan15 and of The Devil's Guard11 ; and it
holds the central interest in many other occult stories.
This periodical testing of the soul — which is intensified
on the shorter, steeper path of quickened evolution — forms
the basis for all symbolic rituals of initiation, from Ancient
Mysteries to modern Masonry. But the real tests, the subtl
est and the hardest, occur in the lives of those who are filled
with aspirations for spiritual growth, "aspirations which are
ever being debased by our lower animal nature."17
However, "him whose senses are utterly subdued, whom
no desires can lead captive any more — by what tempta
tions can ye draw him?"18 He has risen above temptation
by being unassailably pure. "He is no longer the subject
of temptation ... for he has entered into the reign of
law.""

LXXXIV
REGENERATION
"When you have conquered entirely
all sex desires . . . then the regen
erate body becomes a vessel to hold
spirit."
— Butler, The Goal of Li/«,xxiii,
315-
Closely allied are degeneration, generation and regenera
tion, caused as they are by one and the same force. The
difference lies in the way in which that force is being used.
Degeneration results if it is misused sexually for physical
gratification. Generation normally follows its use for repro
duction. In order to bring about regeneration the selfsame
force must be transformed in the individual into spiritual
power.
"Regeneration ... is the turning of the generative
force to purposes of spiritual enlightenment."1 It "means
the awakening of the higher consciousness."1 "To be regen
erate is to be born into spiritual life."3 Those who have gone
through the experience have testified that it is literally true
that "there is ... a new birth possible to embodied man,
which shall manifestly develop the potencies of his spiritual
being."4 "This second birth leads to the attuning of the in
dividual consciousness with that which is universal and di
vine."5
The new birth "in every conceivable direction adds to
the capacity of mind and body"6; it "produces great men
tal and spiritual strength, which if directed intelligently
will develop supernormal powers."7 And "the flesh itself
shall be clarified."8 "The regenerative forces which now
slumber in man's inner nature . . . when roused into ac
tivity tranform him ultimately into a divine being."9
In the process of regeneration a person actually builds
a new body for himself. Cell by cell is renovated and raised
to a higher vibration by the transmuted life force. This is

the most important evolutionary accomplishment of man.
"Propagation ... is wholly subordinate to the primary
and vital use of one's generative energy in reproducing from
hour to hour one's own body."10
Regeneration, then, is tantamount to rebirth without
first passing through death. It is as though entering into a
new life in a new world, with new laws and new experiences,
through an inner change while remaining in the body.
"There is no regeneration after the body has died."11
But although the process takes place without death of
the body, yet something must perish, something must be
killed before the new birth can eventuate. The regenera
tion of man depends on the destruction of everything that
obscures his true inner being. Not any particle of one's old
sensual nature can be taken along into the spiritual birth.
"The process of this birth is described as ... a purging
out of the tendencies of the lower nature and replacing
them by the energies of the divine powers."1' Not until this
has been accomplished "can there be born within the earthly
man of flesh a new spiritual man."1* And "thereafter the
physical man is felt to be ... an instrument through which
the spiritual man works; whereas the spiritual man is felt
to be the real individuality."1*
"This spiritual state is as far superior to man's ordinary
terrestrial existence as the latter is to his foetal condition."
"The sage arrived at this state has the truer fullness of life,
of life not spilled out in sensation."14 "But this cannot hap
pen before every animal element is eliminated from one's
Every person has to make preparation for his own re
generation.
When the life force is functioning for physical genera
tion it is differentiated into a male and a female aspect, re
quiring the cooperation of the two. But "in the process of
evolution sex energy . . . turns inward within the organ
ism and creates in it a new life, capable of regeneration."18
In this new form the force is alike in woman and in man.
And not only is the spiritual energy alike in the two sexes,
but the organs through which regeneration operates are the

same in woman and in man. Therefore regeneration must
be achieved by each one separately.
Not every one however can successfully and fully bring
the new birth about in a short time. "This is possible only
for the man or woman who has attained a very high state
of mental and physical purity."19 "One cannot go far in
this direction until the spirit impresses upon the conscious
ness the fact that one must overcome carnal generation and
must absolutely stop all waste of the seed."10 In other words,
"for the task of giving new birth to oneself celibacy is the
first and absolute prerequisite.""
The reason for this requirement is that as already stated
"in both, generation and regeneration, the same potent force
of nature is involved, namely the force concerned with the
sexual organism."82 This force can be directed either to
the physical generative organs in the body's lower regions
or to the spiritual regenerative organs in the head. But so
entirely different in every respect are the functions of regen
eration and those of generation that they are antagonistic
and mutually exclusive. All generative, all sexual expression
must cease if spiritual regeneration is to be effectively pro
duced.
"In this fundamental idea of regeneration is to be found
the explanation of the universal insistence upon chastity
... on the part of great spiritual leaders."13 No truly
spiritual leader can be lax or lenient on this point. Regen
eration requires perfect chastity because "the mystical birth
of man ... is based on the transmutation of sex energy."14
"Man cannot become regenerated so long as he plays with
generation."15

LXXXV
UNCOILING THE SERPENT
"Through practice the serpent power,
which is coiled, becomes straight
ened."
— Togakundali Upanishadj.
In all preceding chapters the ideal of sex purification has
been substantiated by manifold considerations. By cumula
tive evidence the fact has been brought out that perfect pu
rity is of paramount value whenever an individual wishes to
comply with the law of spiritual unfoldment.
Each of the many substantiations contributes in its own
way to the acceptability of the ideal of perfect chastity.
Founded on the mass of material already presented, this
ideal might well be left to stand without needing any ad
ditional support. Yet one of the most fundamental reasons
for the necessity of sexual purity in spiritual development
has not yet been given.
All the "miscellaneous applications of chastity . . .
must ultimately be based on physiological phenomena."1
There is a close approach to such an ultimate basis in the
physiology of the Occident, in its new knowledge about the
internal secretions of the sex glands.2 In addition to their
importance in regard to body and mind, "every bit of evi
dence points to the internal secretions as the holders of the
secrets of our inmost being."3 There is a growing recogni
tion that "the reproductive system is the reservoir of vital
energy upon which to draw for all the activities and
achievements of life"4, including the spiritual. But as long as
Western science almost generally continues to ignore the
spiritual element, "the knowledge of the essential factors of
sexuality is still withheld from us."5
For the rationale of sex purification one has to turn to
the meta-physiology of the less materialistic Orient, where
the modus operandi of spiritualization has been the subject
of extensive study for thousands of years. Particularly in

302 The Coiled Serpent
regard to spiritual science "our vaunted Nordic intellect
needs to learn respect for the claims and assertions of the
Oriental mind.'" There one can learn about the working
of nature's finer forces within the human frame ; about the
real purpose of some generally little understood organs in
the head ; about a series of chakras or psychic nerve centers,
of which "the glands are only the outer symbols"7 ; about
force channels and force currents along the spinal column ;
and about the Kundalini, the mysterious serpent fire at the
lower end of the spine.
Because those psychic centers are not visible, not dissect-
ible, not measurable with physical instruments, their exis
tence is not recognized by Western scientists. But "the fact
that no microscope can detect such centers on the objective
plane goes for nothing"8, since they are evidently built of
finer matter than can possibly be observed by any physical
means. And as regards the forces and the fires of occult
physiology, their existence may be accepted for the same
reason that we accept the existence of ordinary nerve force
and of mind. These are just as little tangible, and are
known only by their results. In the same manner the secret
fires and forces have proved their existence in the results
obtained by those who have learned how to use them.
One might prove the presence of such forces in oneself.
But the difficulty is that "the working of the spinal fires
... is so tremendously involved that many years must
be spent in learning to understand even the fundamental
principles."*
Briefly stated, it is taught in the far East that in woman
and man alike "there is a power, called the Kundalini.""
"It is at the base of the spinal column . . . that this
mighty occult power lies coiled like a serpent asleep."11
An impersonal as well as an individual meaning is
attached to this all-important force.
In the widest sense "the Kundalini is the creator and
the sustainer of the universe"12 ; "it is the universal life prin
ciple which everywhere manifests in nature."13 "Kunda
lini is therefore the mightiest manifestation of creative po
wer in the human body."14

Uncoiling the Serpent 303
Thus Kundalini may well be held to be the individual
ized power divine, planted in the body as a seed out of
which it is intended that a perfect human flower shall de
velop. This divine seed can be left, as it is generally left,
in the generative region, to be eaten away by the worms of
sensuality or to go to waste by neglect without a chance
to sprout. But "a wise man should take it up from its place
to the middle of the eyebrows"15 ; he should carefully tend
it,
so that
it
may germinate and shoot
a
stem up along the
spine. Not without good reason does the spinal cord — that
high-tension transmission line of nerve force — run from
the lower part of the trunk to the head.
It
is
along this line
that the life force must be diverted from the generative
system and carried up to the organs of regeneration near
the top of the skull.
"Once the serpent power
is
aroused into activity,
it
is
made to penetrate one by one the psychic nerve centers
until
it
reaches the thousand-petalled lotus in the brain."1'
But "so long as man can be controlled by his senses
it
is
utterly impossible for him to revive that now atrophied
center in the head
.
. . which
is
essential to the control of
the truly creative forces."17 Having worked its way up to
that point, the serpent power opens the highest spiritual
center of man the thinker, man the knower, man the crea
tor, man at last in the image of God.
"In the transference of the fire from the base of the
spine . . . lies the redemption of man."18 With the raising
of Kundalini, with the uncoiling of the serpent fire, comes
the advancement of the race to superhuman glory. This
is
what nature's law of evolution has intended for mankind,
for man and woman alike.
The intentional arousing of Kundalini cannot be strong
ly
enough warned against until
a
very high degree of pre
paratory purification of one's whole being has been brought
about. And
a
theoretical study of the intricate ways in
which Kundalini manifests
is
not strictly essential to ad
vanced evolutionary growth. For whether or not one who
aspires to spiritual unfoldment has any knowledge of the
serpent power,
it
becomes nevertheless active in the body.

304 The Coiled Serpent
Whether or not one is aware of
it,
nature responds to one's
spiritual aspirations by arousing this force when one
is
ready for it. Its ascent to the brain
is
inseparable from pro
gressive evolution.
Even with conscious cooperation of the individual the
uncoiling of the serpent still remains
a
slow and difficult
procedure. Any one who sets himself the task of perfecting
it
"will have to repeat the process for years, never allowing
one speck of impurity to stain him mentally or physically."19
"The thought, the will and the morality . . . must first be
purified before they are intensified by the vivifying influence
of the aroused force."20
"There
is
most serious peril in awakening the higher as
pects of this energy before man has acquired the purity of
life and thought which alone make
it
safe for him to un
leash
a
potency so tremendous."11 "The action of the ser
pent force
.
.
. should be preceded by the most rigid pu
rificatory discipline"12, because "the fire
is
destructive to the
unpurified who might succeed in arousing it."13 When pre
maturely aroused before the attainment of utmost purity,
"the dangers connected with
it
are very real and terribly
serious."24
Just as long as the force of Kundalini
is
held down to
the organs of generation by sexual acts or thoughts, so long
will
it
be unable to rise to the sublime organs of regeneration
and of creation. And
if
it
is
drawn down after beginning to
rise, the cataclystic disturbances in the currents of finer
forces react on the rest of the body, and especially on the
brain, in such
a
way that physical and mental disorders are
sure to follow.
Once Kundalini begins to rise, "the close connection
.
.
.
between the brain and the reproductive system nec
essitates an absolute conservation of life energies."15 That
is
the essential point which may never for
a
moment be for
gotten.
These physiological, or at least meta-physiological facts
constitute the final and fundamental reason why perfect sex
ual purity
is
essential for those who seek to quicken their
evolutionary growth.

Uncoiling the Serpent 305
But others too should remember that as long as human
ity plays with the sacred serpent fire it will suffer from the
resultant burns, which cause the pains of average human ex
istence. Everybody should heed what a knowledge of
Oriental meta-physiology makes clear : that "the miseries of
existence can be extinguished only by arriving at a con
dition . . . free from passions."" Every act of sexual in
dulgence and of self-gratification retards the possibility of
liberation from woe.

LXXXVI
THE FUTURE
"Is the human race never to arrive
at this highest grade of illumination
and purity?"
— Lessino, The Education of the
Human Race,hoai.
We are traveling along toward an improved humanity
which will attain the realization of those "higher aspira
tions which . . . emerge in the hearts of the spiritually-
minded who are prophetic of a better future."1
If we so willed, we could speed on toward our ideal
evolutionary destination.
But we hamper our progress by carrying unnecessary
baggage, and therefore only slowly and uncomfortably ad
vance towards the perfection that awaits us. If we could
part with all the surplus baggage, of which the desires for
sense-gratification constitute the bulkiest portion, then we
could fly instead of trek unto the destined goal. There, still
within the boundaries of the human kingdom and of physi
cal existence, we would find a world which is separated
from the one in which most of us now live — separated not
by physical distance but by grades of consciousness. These
grades can easily be passed by any one who is willing to
take the steps required for spiritual unfoldment which al
ways brings expansion of consciousness with it. "If the
spiritual life grows towards perfection ... it will reveal
a new world which exalts us far above all petty human
considerations."*
Some pioneers, prospecting in that new world, have
signalled messages about their findings to single travelers
along the road, and these messages have been relayed to
slower moving groups. In their reports the pioneers tell of
finding marvelous treasures of matchless joy, in comparison
with which humanity's present pleasures are insipid and
childish. They have discovered spiritual springs ensuring

radiant health. They mention beauty never parallelled, as
the natural manifestation of spiritual qualities untainted by
blemishes of self or of sense.
They have crossed the line which marks the end of hu
man suffering. This they look back upon as a scourge pro
duced by man himself, which the economy of nature has
utilized to advantage as an aid in the development of higher
qualities in him for the advancement of his evolutionary
growth.
They report a wondrous expansion of intelligence to
which nature's deepest secrets become plain. They have
acquired an understanding of realities of which all that we
now know is only a distorted incomplete reflection. And
with their wider knowledge their power of expression has
vastly grown.
They testify to the development of higher faculties
which admit them to a realm of new splendors, where they
can hear the symphonies produced by sunset colors and by
fields of flowers, and where they are aware of the music
of the spheres. They speak of new dimensions which make
distance non-existent; of penetrating with extended vision
into the densest matter; of seeing the thoughts of others;
of letting past and future pass like moving pictures before
their inner eye; of consciousness unbroken3 and of death
overcome.4
Some of the wayfarers who have not yet quite reached
the fields of the new world have added to these messages
of the pioneers tales of their own experiences. As they ap
proach the goal they have felt life grow brighter, richer,
fuller of interest. They have received a foretaste of the joys
of the new world.
"In that supreme and happy world all the trials of the
human race will be over."5 But "in those who are to par
ticipate in this new world every vestige of mere impulse
must vanish.'" "Into that paradise . . . nothing impure
can enter."7
Perfection cannot be attained without complete purifi
cation. In overlooking this fact lies the error of Utopian
dreamers who would establish ideally purified social con

ditions without enjoining purity of emotions and of thought,
without exacting purity from passion. "They will only
agree in adopting a political treatment for a disease which
is spiritual." "Human improvement is from within out
ward. Spiritual regeneration must come first . . . political
and social last."9 Without the reform of man social reform
can have no lasting effect. For this reason every sociologi
cally idealistic colony has failed and will fail until stress is
laid on purification from within. But perfected world con
ditions will automatically result from individual spiritual
perfection ; and "a true sign of perfection is found ... in
a full liberation from sexual passion."10
"Spiritual humanity not only understands this perfec
tion with the intellect . . . but accepts it in its conduct."11
Spiritually inclined man takes care that "passion no longer
rules and blinds him to universal laws and higher princi
ples."11 He sees sex as a universal problem, given in the
school of life to be solved in the mental-human grade. One's
spiritual faculties begin to be trained while seriously work
ing on this problem; they are dulled when the problem is
taken lightly and degraded into a game.
All mankind must gradually solve that problem and
learn the lesson of unselfish renunciation which sex in its
intended purity was meant to teach by instilling a loving,
self-forgetting attachment to and care for others."" When
that lesson has been learned to perfection humanity will
overcome and outgrow the need of sex which, as a universal
institution, will become as obsolete as its concomitant ele
ments of sexual desire and of concupiscence.
Undoubtedly nature will eventually do away with its
system of separate sexes and institute another way of re
production, just as it has changed from non-subservient
methods in the past. It may be expected that the present
sexual organs will then become "entirely useless vestigial
organs to be forgotten by those who have outgrown their
use."14
Occultists have definitely claimed that "this mode of
procreation ... is but a passing phase"11, which "will
change . . . and disappear."1* "The most learned occul

tists assert this, because they know it."17 And men of science
already begin to suspect "an evolutionary process drifting
slowly and inevitably into the neuter state."1'
However, before an outer change can become general
mankind itself must have established an inner change. It
must have produced "a future humanity more elevated
morally than ours."19 We must first see "both sexes . . .
winnowed of materiality"*0 and weaned from sensuality.
Before nature makes a change mankind must free itself from
the strangling grip of the serpent's coils, and reach the high
est moral perfection to which the human race can attain.

SUPERMEN
"Such men are even now upon the
earth, serene amid the half-formed
creatures who should be . . . joined
with them."
—Browning, Paracelsus, V,783-5.
As the ripe fruit is hidden within the blossom's hard green
bud, so is a sublime superhumanity hidden within the pre
sent rudimental human race. Ultimately "the future be
longs not to man but to superman."1 "Humanity is some
thing that must be surpassed.'" Even "the best is still
something that must be surpassed."3
In the process of evolution the vegetable kingdom has
surpassed the mineral, the animal the vegetable, and the
human the animal. So the superhuman kingdom shall sur
pass, and has surpassed already to some extent even the
highest human specimens.
A definitely marked expansion of consciousness distin
guishes each of nature's kingdoms from its next lower one.
"Gradations from the animal to the god . . . must be
measured by the progressive deepening and expanding of
consciousness."4 The highest examples of each kingdom are
those in which a trace of the expanded consciousness of the
next higher kingdom begins to show. The highest animals,
for instance, are not the ones in which instinct finds its
most remarkable expression, such as it does in ants and
bees; they are those in which is found a sign of self-con
scious intellect. So also the highest human specimens arc
not the most self-conscious personalities with the most re
markable intellects, nor the scientific geniuses, nor the
greatest industrialists, nor the most powerful empire
builders. All these may be wonderful examples of ex
tremely well developed human efficiency ; but they no more
approach the superhuman than an ant or bee approaches
the human stage.

3*4 The Coiled Serpent
"The development of man towards superman cannot
consist in the growth of the intellect alone.'" "The expan
sion of consciousness, the inner growth of man, is the as
cent towards superman."* The highest human beings are
those who show in spiritual development a rudiment of the
wider, of the well-nigh divine consciousness which charac
terizes the superhuman kingdom. Only "the heroes of
supreme renunciation . . . touch the nebulous beginnings
of a superhuman nature."7
To each kingdom the expanded consciousness of the
next higher must necessarily remain incomprehensible for
lack of a faculty by which to comprehend it. To the ani
mal consciousness a human creature can be no more than
just another animal; and to the purely intellectual human
being a superman will seem to be no more than human.
It requires spiritual faculties to even vaguely sense the
transcendent superiority of the superman.
It is therefore quite possible that "superman ... is
already born and lives among us"8 without being recognized
by the majority of mankind. It is quite conceivable that
there should exist and long has existed on earth an evolu
tionary advance guard consisting of individuals "who are
... as far above human beings as the latter are above
animals"9, and who "can act superhumanly, that is after
a manner which transcends the normal possibility of men."1'
In some of the old Hindu books, written thousands of
years ago, "one may read in story after story . . . how
these perfected men, known as superhuman by the powers
that they possessed, visited the courts of kings in order to see
that kingdoms were well governed."11
In the days of ancient Egypt, also millenniums ago,
"Hermes Trismegistus . . . spoke of holy men whose knowl
edge and comprehension of divine wisdom immeasurably
surpassed that of humanity."11 "But these", he said, "are
rather immortal than mortal men"13, "and their humanity
is near divinity."14 Clearly he too was speaking of supermen.
"Men dwelling on the earth and yet not of it"15 they
were called by Apollonius of Tyana at the beginning of
our era.

SUPERMEN 315
In the seventeenth century Philalethes must have had
supermen in mind when he complained that "every sophis-
ter contemns them because they appear not to the world.""
And he explained "upon what grounds they conceal them
selves"17 by saying that "no man looks for them but for
worldly ends."18 For this same reason people are still look
ing for them in vain. For all worldly, separative, selfish
intentions automatically preclude the possibility of contact
with the selfless, unifying forces of the supermen.
In the eighteenth century Eckartshausen was acquainted
with "the unique and really illuminated community which
is in possession of the key to all mystery . . . This com
munity has no outside barriers . . . Any one can look for
the entrance, but only he who is ripe can arrive inside."1'
A Rosicrucian work of the same period contains another
reference to supermen. It distinctly states that "a direct
intercourse with them is not possible for man unless he
becomes sufficiently purified"20, and that only "by a proper
course of spiritual training can we come in contact with
those beings.""
Much later again one who had established an excep
tionally close link with them wrote on this possibility of con
tact: "Merely the magneto-psychic law of attraction and
repulsion keeps the Adepts from exchanging thoughts with
a man who lives . . . among the magnetic fumes of car
nality and of spiritual atrophy.""
And a great thinker of our own days has said that "man
is separated from superman ... by the fact that be is not
prepared to receive superman."23 And rarely is he willing
to make himself worthy of the contact.
Carnality and spiritual atrophy — these must be over
come before man can be a candidate for conscious contact
with superman. "The candidate must ... be perfectly
chaste, perfectly abstemious"24, because "the impure are
not permitted to approach the pure."25 This requirement
does not necessarily exclude the rare, pure, sacrificial sexual
act for the sake of giving a soul a chance to come into the
world under favorable parental conditions ; but it disallows
the slightest expression of carnal gratification.

316 The Coiled Serpent
As to the supermen, "it is the spirit of chaste asceticism
itself which incarnates in these elect."" Of them it has
been said that "they are individuals who . . . rising by
the steadfast subordination of their lower and by exaltation
of their higher nature have at length made of their bodies
instruments of their souls and means of expression instead
of sources of limitation for their spirits."17 They have been
described as "profoundest of intelligence, widest of culture,
ripest of experience, tenderest of heart, purest of soul, raa-
turest of spirit."18 "Only to them and to those who know
and follow their method is it given to live the life of the
spirit while in the body."19 And they bear testimony that
"one who is all spirit and love will have conquered the
flesh even in memory."30
In the world of superman the uncoiled serpent has been
disentangled for ever from sex, and its energy has been
transmuted into almost unlimited knowledge and supreme
spiritual power. These faculties are awaiting all who will
take in hand their evolution from the human toward the
superhuman state by steadfastly practising the required
subordination of the lower and exaltation of the higher
nature.

LXXXVIII
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS
"The cosmic sense crushes the ser
pent's head."
— Bucke, Cosmic Consciousness,l,w,
6.
Locked in a dark dungeon of ignorance, shut off from the
rays of spiritual light, man can but speculate upon the
source of the feeble gleam that occasionally penetrates
through the inadequate apertures in the walls of his prison.
Pacing up and down and 'round and 'round he vaguely
philosophizes in the abstract. But abstract thought and
philosophic speculation alone cannot bring more light into
his prison-cell. Some definite action must be taken to widen
the apertures and to tear down the walls.
Outside there awaits "beyond all mental powers . . .
a state of consciousness in which the highest wisdom and
power are attainable."1 It is the state of infallible cogni
tion of eternal truth and of absolute reality, the state that
has been called : the cosmic consciousness. This "is a higher
form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary
man."2 "It can be known by no one except by him who
has experienced it. Those who live within the realm of
animality ... do not even believe that such a state can
possibly exist.'" Only "he who vanquishes as much as pos
sible a corporeal life . . . can live surrounded with the
bright splendors of truth and wisdom."4
"All sensuous impressions form a wall between the soul
and the world of reality."5 "Absolute truth does not exist
for sensuous man ; it exists only for spiritual man who pos
sesses ... a faculty which cognizes spiritual objects as
naturally as the exterior senses perceive external phenom
ena."" "Man . . . cannot observe the splendor of eternal
verities so long as he is held by the attraction of the senses."7
"To develop the consciousness of reality ... it is nec
essary to rise above merely human aims and conditions."8

Cosmic Consciousness 319
"The struggle for reality must be a struggle to transcend
the sense-world ... to be reborn to a higher level of con
sciousness"9, and "to rise by free action to the higher plane
of cosmic life."10
In order to succeed in this attainment it is especially
requisite to rise above the disturbing emotions of sex. For
"once having freed oneself from the entanglements of the
fleshly lust . . . man enters into a higher state of con
sciousness"11, and automatically begins to grow toward the
cosmic consciousness of the superman.
"Cosmic consciousness . . . must not be looked upon as
being in any sense supernatural, or as anything but a nat
ural growth."" But certain definite requirements have to be
met before it can manifest. "It is necessary for its appear
ance that an exalted human personality should exist."1'
"Above all one must have an exalted moral nature."14
"Just as long ago our ancestors passed from simple
awareness to self-consciousness, so our descendants will
sooner or later reach, as a race, the condition of cosmic con
sciousness."15 And then, away from every form of self-grat
ification, the race will acquire an ever greater share of cos
mic spiritual power.
This power, the rightful heritage of man, can already
now successfully be claimed by all who are willing to re
nounce the deceptive excitements of sense and of sex for
the ecstatic cosmic consciousness, the consciousness of one
ness. But its "states of bliss are possible of attainment only
through transcending the reproductive tendencies alto
gether."1*

ONENESS
"The love of the sexes . . . symboli
zes at a distance the longing of the
soul for that immense lake of beauty
it exists to seek."
— Emerson, Representative Men, (I,
348).
Oneness is the keynote of spirit. "The question of attain
ing this oneness is the most essential question of the inner
development of man."1
Deep in every human soul lies the knowledge of that
oneness which finds a constrained and deformed expression
in the search for happiness by union with external things.
The reaching for a toy, the desire for pleasure, the fond
ness for delicate food, the grasping for possessions, the urge
for sexual union — all are distorted manifestations of the
longing for a realization of basic spiritual oneness, for uni
fication of the self with the not-self.
"Those who are seeking life in the things that perish
. . . are but unconsciously, blindly groping after the in
effable joys of the spirit."1 They seek without exactly
knowing what, in a direction away from oneness. They
seek in things external what only within themselves can be
found. They seek in the material what inheres in the spir
itual world.
At best "the physical union is like an allegory ... of
the real union."3 "The earthly expression is but a symbol."4
But who, after having glimpsed the real union and after
being aware of the reality of spiritual oneness, can be sat
isfied with allegories and symbols? Who wants to accept
substitutes after knowing that realities can be obtained —
especially where the substitutes detract from and prevent
the acquisition of the reality?
The greatest cosmic reality is the oneness of all life, the
oneness that exists above all seeming separateness, beyond

all apparent duality. The way toward a realization of that
oneness is covered with an almost impenetrable growth of
selfish idiosyncrasies of the separative personality. These
have to be cut down before the oneness can consciously be
reached. Complete self-effacement of the material person
ality must necessarily precede a realization of impersonal
spiritual oneness. For this purpose every element of passion,
which is always selfish, must make room for compassion;
and personal love for one, after being developed to its high
est and purest state, must be expanded into impersonal love
for all.
The more spiritual a person becomes the more cogni
zant also will he be of the identity of his own innermost be
ing with that of all other living forms. "In his inmost self
man is related to other selves in such a fashion that he lives
in them and they in him."5 With increasing spirituality
comes a fading of the feeling of separateness of the indi
vidual from other individuals, of the family from other
families, of the nation from other nations, of the human
kingdom from other kingdoms of nature. The more of spirit
can manifest the nearer one approaches to "the conscious
ness of the identity of one's own nature with that of all
things"6, and the higher one rises above the concepts of
separateness and of duality. But "only when the mind
becomes free from all desires and passions the idea of
duality ceases."7
Only by rising in consciousness above sex can the one
ness of all life be realized. For sex itself is an expression of
duality, and all self-gratifying sexual activity emphasizes
and strengthens the separative personality. Moreover, as
long as the lower physical centers are used for self-gratifi
cation the higher spiritual centers cannot be utilized for
the necessary elevation and expansion of consciousness.8
A persevering effort to bring about self-purification and
spiritualization until all separateness is overcome is needed
to bring one closer to a conscious realization of oneness. And
the nearer this is approached, the greater the joy of living,
which ultimately develops into an impregnable felicity.

DEATHLESSNESS
"The serpent brought death into the
world."
— Hiooins, Anacaljrpsis,lX,vi,;j2i.
"Eros is mysteriously connected with death."1
"The association of death and reproduction is indeed
patent enough."1 However, "it is not death that makes
reproduction necessary, but reproduction has death as its
inevitable consequence."' "The kingdom of death is main
tained ... by carnal reproduction."4 The human race
"knew death only . . . after the separation of the sexes."*
"Sex as it is is the beginning of death.'" "To expend life
in human embraces is to strike roots in the grave."T
These appalling statements, selected from the writings
of eminent, unprejudiced minds, may sound phantastic and
unbelievable. Yet, when a medical scholar declares in
scientific language that "erethism of any kind, in both male
and female, represents a katabolic crisis"8, he is but saying
that any kind of excitement or stimulation of the organs of
generation is a disruptive waste of energy. And this prac
tically affirms that "the carnal way is the way of the break
ing up and scattering of the life force, and the end of it
is death."9
In lower forms of existence it has been definitely ob
served that "the reproduction of many types is followed by
the death of the individual"10, often within a few hours
after propagative activity. And although "it is one of the
trends of evolution to lessen the physiological strain of re
production"11, it remains true also in the human kingdom
that "reproduction is a drain on the parent.""
"The passions . . . wear out the earthly body with
their own secret power."1* "All amorous passion ... is
a whirlpool seeking to draw us down into the gulf of
death."1* Qabbalistically speaking "the serpent caused

death to the whole world."15 In the mythologies of various
peoples "the serpent is concerned . . . with the origin of
death."16
"From the concupiscence of the flesh . . . death has
drawn its origin."" With the general spread and stimula
tion of concupiscence "death . . . has appeared in the
course of evolution."18 Hence "death is ... accidental
rather than natural"19 ; "death may be said to have become
an imported accident into the scheme of things."10
"God did not make death."11 "Man has created it
himself.""
The quoted statements might suggest the thought that
persons who never commit a sexual act should not be sub
ject to death. But in the course of time the racial habit of
wasting the life force has so impressed itself upon the seed
that concupiscence and loss of vital fluids occur even in
those who are most meticulously continent, so that for them
too there is no immediate escape from death. The germ-
plasm from which present humanity is raised has been so
weakened by careless, sensual propagation that unduly
early bodily decay as well as death seems to have become
the unavoidable fate of all. Through heredity "the body
is no longer capable of producing normal and well-vitalized
seed."15 Allegorically expressed "the serpent has poisoned
. . . the source of all organic life."14
Decay of the living body as well as death can be over
come by the purifying process of spiritualization, by which
the natural laws that apply to coarser matter are tran
scended. By this process the body elements that do not
harmonize with the higher spiritual vibrations are gradually
cast off and replaced by finer, almost etheric atoms. "The
physical man must be rendered more ethereal.""
"Like the fugitive who successfully casts away in his
flight those articles which incommode his progress, begin
ning with the heaviest, so the aspirant eluding death aban
dons all on which the latter can take hold."1* For this pur
pose "the candidate for longevity . . . must begin to es
chew his physical desires"17 ; especially "the sexual desires,

for these . . . are direct attractions to a certain gross
quality of the original matter."18 And "he must beware . . .
of impure and animal thoughts."19
Purification of the body, of the emotions and of the
thoughts is necessary in order to weaken the resistance of
the lower elements of the personality, if the spiritual in
dividual wills to postpone and finally to overcome death.
In this way it can come about that "when men are innocent
life shall be longer."30 "The actual prolongation of human
life is possible for so long as to appear miraculous and
incredible.""
It is not unreasonable to expect that in the end the
body can be made deathless. For "old age and death . . .
are pathological."" "Death is not a universal accompani
ment of life"33, "death is not an essential attribute of living
matter."34 Nor is death an absolutely necessary phenomenon
in the existence of a composite living body.
However, no one can expect suddenly to attain death-
lessness. But every one can make an effective beginning
with the struggle against death by taking up the struggle
against sex. Doing this one shall gradually by experience
discover that "with the extinction of sensual desire man is
released of death's most powerful bond.""
"To withstand the allurement of generation is to gradu
ate in the conquest of death."3* This is equivalent to the
biblical statement that "he that overcometh shall not be
hurt of . . . death."37 When the sexual urge has been
entirely overcome man can become truly the master of his
fate, even in regard to birth and death. For then a physical
body can be taken on when wanted, to be used as a perfect
instrument for self-expression during centuries if so wished ;
and such a body can be laid aside at will for any length of
time while the human entity lives on in unbroken con
sciousness.
Thus "he who will conquer sex will conquer death.""

IMMORTALITY
"When a person is able to conquer
the passional nature he is . . . con
joined to the immortal state."
—Butler, Solar Biology,i,2$.
"Essentially we are spirit."1 And since spirit is eternal
and immortal we are inherently immortal. We are only
"mortal because of body, but because of the essential man
immortal."1
However, we are not conscious of our immortality be
cause we identify ourselves so largely with our mortal
bodies ; for "in so far as a man turns to the mortal part of
himself, in so far he makes his mind incommensurate with
immortality."3
Hence in order to become conscious of his spiritual im
mortal state man must overcome his attachment to the
ephemeral existence in the physical body. Furthermore
he must expand mentally from accumulating knowledge to
a search for wisdom, because "by wisdom immortality is
reached."4 And above all else he must rise to an exception
ally high moral standard, because also "along with moral
elevation . . . comes a sense of immortality."5
To gain a realization of immortality it is necessary to
renounce every semblance of immorality and to transcend
the relative morality of ordinary mortals. "The mortal
becomes immortal . . . only when all desires cease."8 "By
crucifying the man of flesh and his passions"7, and "by the
restraint of the senses . . . man becomes fit for immor
tality."8 "The mortal shall put on immortality . . . when
trained to everlasting chastity."9
As expressed in the traditions of many peoples "the
serpent . . . defrauds the human race of the gift of im
mortality."10 Therefore "the first step toward [a realization
of] immortality is to gain full control of the sex function.""

XCII
EPILOGUE
"The ideal of spiritual intuition to
be reached through moral purity rep
resents an eternal fact."
— Black, Culture and Restraint,vi,
156.
In the now completed mosaic picture of an ideal concept
imperfections will undoubtedly be found to exist in some
of the numerous particles of which it is composed. But
the ensemble is relied upon to leave an impression of the
grave significance of its leading motive. Out of the multi
colored mass arises everywhere in plain design the basic
motive, embodying the assertion that perfect purity is an
ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT FOR ADVANCED EVOLUTIONARY
GROWTH.
It is not claimed that purity alone will be sufficient to
bring about quick and astounding results. Even under the
most favorable conditions growth remains a gradual pro
cess. Other requirements for evolutionary development are
sufficiently known and recognized. The need of sexual puri
fication, however, is so often overlooked or ignored or, as
in the case of many supposedly spiritual leaders, unpardon-
ably slighted, that it called for separate accentuation.
Nobody is advised to become a perfect celibate, unless
an inner urge betokens readiness for such a resolution. No
sudden, drastic changes are recommended to any one. Some
are farther away than others from the point where the
ideal beacons. Some therefore have to take more steps
before coming near enough to be in constant contact with
its radiant energy.
But everybody should understand that the salient bene
fits of higher attainments cannot be acquired without the
practical realization of sexual purity. Howsoever far one
still may be away from the ideal, it can be seen by any one
who looks in its direction. A beginning can and eventually

must be made to move toward its light. Each for himself
must find out just where he stands, and how fast he will go.
Little influence can be exerted from the outside, except by
mental persuasion.
The only purpose of the laborious compilation of data
contained in this volume has been to present as convincingly
as possible the existence as a fact in nature of the evolu
tionary need of individual sexual purification. Evidence
has been supplied that the profoundest thinkers have up
held the ideal of purity as a golden precept of paramount
natural law. Of it "the great moral prophets . . . have
spoken with a certain approach to unanimity."1 "All the
great teachers of the world are agreed in protesting against
the dominion of appetite in the life of man.'" "All the great
organized religions have seized on the value of sexual ab
stinence . . . and embodied it in their system"3, in order
to teach their adherents to transmute the sexual into
spiritual energy.
"The historians of civilization seem to be unanimous
in the opinion that a deviation of sexual motive powers
from sexual to new aims has furnished potent componenti
for all cultural accomplishments."4 In fact, "limitation of
the sexual opportunity must be regarded as the cause of
cultural advance."*
"Psychological researches reveal that the placing of a
compulsory check upon the sexual impulses . . . produces
thought and energy"8, thereby promoting individual and
racial evolutionary progress. Various branches of human
knowledge, from biology and ethnology to alchemy and
occultism, have been shown to point in the same direction.
"Moralists both ancient and modern . . . have never
ceased to urge men to refrain from seeking sexual indul
gence"7, even though often they did not understand and
therefore failed to explain the evolutionary importance of
such abstinence. Philosophers who verged on contact with
spirit through abstract thought, mystics who reached the
plane of spirit in devotional experience, and many of the
noblest amongst humanity have always realized that "chas
tity, both as practice and as principle, is a biological and

psychological moment ... of profound significance.'"
They have insisted on the need of sexual purity. And the
nearer man approaches superman the more insistent sounds
the exhortation.
That so many of the most advanced of the human race,
independent of one another, in different ways, from different
viewpoints, in different places and at different times, have
come to the same conclusion, is in itself an indication that
the ideal of purity is of universal scope. Adding together
all the factual and circumstantial evidences that have been
presented, we can hardly fail to see that this ideal contains
a truth of everlasting value, and that sexual purification is
a requisite for the harmoniously balanced physical, moral,
mental and spiritual development of the race.
Man can delay the evolutionary process. He can an
tagonize the law of growth. Tarrying in the labyrinth of
the senses, where spiritual light can never penetrate, he can
philosophize that spirit does not exist. In the material
world he can establish ways of living from which all loftier
considerations are left out.
This is what has been done, and what in modern times
is being done to an ever greater extent. Amongst other
things "the spirit has been removed from sex, and the dying
body is . . . infecting the dissolving civilization."* The
very existence of civilization and of the race is endangered
by adherence to the illusory senses and by a denial of the
sublimer elements of life.
Mankind's salvation, even physically, depends upon an
emergence from the hypnotic spell of the senses. Not until
this spell is broken can humanity perceive the radiant light
of spirit, absorb its vitalizing rays, share in its joy and glory.
Every one is free to choose between the petty pastimes
of the senses and the gradual development of superhuman
power.
But whatever choice is made by individual or race, the
laws of nature remain immutable. They proclaim that
evolution must eventually go on. The deadlock14 must be

broken. "The sensual side of human nature . . . must be
brought into complete subordination to the spiritual."11
Souls who refuse to follow this decree are threatened
with removal from the evolutionary system. Persisting, they
are likely to perish as individualized souls, even as nations
and races which have clashed with spiritual progress by
clinging to matter and to the senses, have perished in the
past.
Over the ruins of destroyed Atlantisses and Sodoms,
over the obliterated graveyards of all sex-addicted races,
evolution must march on toward a lessening of sexual ex
pression — on toward exaltation of spiritual faculties. Only
those who are willing to cooperate with the evolutionary
plan can keep up with the march, and reach the goal where
burdensome existence changes into the rapturous sublimity
of being.
