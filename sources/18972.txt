and
you
what what type of experiences did they
have well there&#39;s a whole range of
experiences as well as in the literature
from military people who have had
encounters in flight and been vectored
to chase and invite objects people who
have official positions whose job was to
know about possible extraterrestrial
visitation and to do something with it
people within government and those are
the more credible sources because
they&#39;ve had hands-on firsthand
experiences all the ways whether they
come forward or not is up to them it&#39;s
if they want to come out with their
information if they don&#39;t feel that
they&#39;re under security constraints and
they somehow get to relief or amnesty
from any oath of security than I would
hope they would come forward there&#39;s a
lot that does go on with these high
security classifications under under
military rules I think it&#39;s a fairly
muddy area when we&#39;re talking about this
this level of activity yes there are
there are some stories that are rather
ghastly as a matter of fact now I can&#39;t
validate those I don&#39;t know that they&#39;re
necessarily true but like many other
stories they put fear in the hearts of
people with
that&#39;s perhaps why many of the people
don&#39;t want to come forward well my
interest basically is what&#39;s the nature
of the universe we live in what is our
relationship to the larger reality if
that&#39;s a part of the larger reality and
we&#39;re denying it that to me is
unconscionable
I don&#39;t live that way the you know I
went into space to learn about the
universe we live in to get new insights
to go beyond the boundaries of our known
existence and if these phenomenon are
really indicate indicators and new
information about the cosmos at all and
intelligent life in the cosmos our
ability to travel in the cosmos as
circumstantial evidence would suggest
then we all get to the bottom of it it&#39;s
just my curiosity that drives me
there seems to have been over the last
50 years at least and more a great deal
of secrecy surrounding the so-called UFO
event it&#39;s a very complex subject we&#39;re
not dealing with something&#39;s very simple
here if we take the pearl well we have
sightings of all sorts
we&#39;ve been reported thousands and
thousands of sightings for 50 years or
so large numbers of large numbers of
those sightings are indeed misperceiving
natural phenomenon in some way but a
large number of them are not
misperceiving they are seen or they seem
to be well-documented events that
represent flying craft that do not match
anything we have in an earthbound
Arsenal which is a very short of saying
we have validated in the public domain
that they are ET craft we have to rely
upon that for to get better answers we
have to rely upon people who have been
there and interacted have first-hand
data the only people I know of that
claim to have been in that position are
former intelligence military and
government people and some contractor
people whose official duties in the
early days were to investigate this in
know about it
those people are under were under at
that time great restrictions and high
security clearance that prevented them
from telling the general public about it
would appear that period is long past
but they still under security
restriction or at least believe they are
there have been ET visitation
have been crashed craft there have been
material and bodies recovered and there
is some group of people somewhere that
may or may not be associated with
government at this point but certainly
were at one time that have this
knowledge and have been attempting to
conceal this knowledge are not permitted
to be widely disseminated I cannot
answer that I cannot answer who are
these people but there&#39;s a lot of
evidence that points to it claimed that
what I call a clandestine group people
who have some quasi affiliation with
government and use certain government
facilities but operate in a rather very
stealth and secret secret way that is
not generally under high-level
governmental control as far as we can
tell yes there has been PT vegetation
and may continue to be there has been
craft that
have been recovered there has been a
certain amount of reverse engineering
that is allowed some of these craft or
some components to be duplicated and
that there are humanoids from our planet
Earthlings who are utilizing some of
this equipment in certain ways and that
perhaps a large part of the activity
that&#39;s classified is UFO activity
abductions and a whole host of this type
of activity may very well not be due to
ET activity at all I would suspect if
any is due to ET activity it&#39;s a really
small part then that a larger portion is
due to humanoid type activity earthling
type activity in a very clandestine
fashion but it is still a fear well I I
will stop short of attaching motivation
to this I don&#39;t know the motivation but
if it&#39;s normal human motivation it has
to do with power and control and greed
and money and so far those type of craft
humongous very very large craft the size
so-called reportedly a size in many
football fields that would be very hard
to manufacture conceal and operate from
an earth base it would seem that that
account is true at all
it probably would have to be something
beyond beyond this realm I think it&#39;s
long past time to open this up to the
public because they don&#39;t know what to
do about it in here I do not see
anything that suggests really malevolent
intent on the part
if there are ets at all I have to place
a caveat if there are a ets at all I
don&#39;t see anything that represents
hostile intent we see things that like
abductions for example that many would
claim were hostile to the extent that
that may be true I would more likely
attribute it to some other cause there
is evidence there is mountain of
evidence if you will that essentially
amounts to smoking gun evidence that has
not been seemingly cannot be brought
forward at this point at least not by
the powers of government or not by what
anything I know about but it seems to
exist there is disinformation the
question of has it been kept secret or
how could it be kept secret
it hasn&#39;t been kept secret it&#39;s been
there all along but it has been the
subject of disinformation in order to
deflect attention and to create
confusion so the truth doesn&#39;t come out
it is disinformation is simply another
method of stonewalling and that&#39;s been
used consistently for the last 50 years
or so weather balloons over Roswell as
opposed to
a crashed craft at some short that&#39;s
disinformation we&#39;ve seen that for 50
years and it&#39;s the best way to hide
something it shouldn&#39;t be any more of an
effect that ETS have come here then that
we have gone to the moon okay it&#39;s just
a part of the way things are and and we
have to understand it and put it in
context of the story of ourselves our
knowledge base of cosmology the nature
of our existence who are we how does the
world work and of course that knowledge
does change our understanding of how the
world or the universe at large works
because until the current period or
until the last 30 years it was
conventional wisdom both in science and
theology we&#39;re alone in the universe the
whole single repository of life anywhere
in the known universe well no one
believes that anymore that changes our
concept of who we are and how we fit and
it&#39;s becoming very clear that the way we
have conducted ourselves as stewards of
life on planet Earth is wanting we
haven&#39;t been good stewards we have
environmental global problems right now
that are that are bringing civilization
to a crisis and people don&#39;t want to
hear that but it&#39;s slowly becoming
obvious but that is true so this
knowledge of who we are how we manage a
planet how we fit into the larger scheme
of things is a very important question
dr. Greer did indeed a mountain of an
initiative and did go to him to
Washington did speak with the high-level
government people did present some of
the witnesses that we&#39;ve talked
well there to give briefings and has
asked for congressional hearings on
these matters
I attended and helped him with that and
I believe that&#39;s a very important effort
that we get congressional oversight of
all of this but so far that hasn&#39;t
happened we briefed certain members of
Congress some of their staffs some of
the people from the White House we
talked with people in the Pentagon and
in general it was well received and some
were quite amazed at what they heard but
so far it has a result of an integrative
&#39;ti did this come to new was his new as
well other years to some people yes yeah
others not really so much but I will say
it led me to the belief that people in
high-level government have very very
little if any information valid
information about this most have no more
knowledge in the man industry
representatives from the intelligence
section they were out of the loop of the
things we&#39;re talking about oh yes it&#39;s a
very great concern I have expressed this
concern over and over that&#39;s exactly
what I&#39;m saying is that whatever
activity is going on to the extent that
it is a clandestine group at crois√© a
government group a quasi private group
it is without any type as far as I can
tell of high-level government oversight
and that is a great concern
