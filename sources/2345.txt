MRS. M. E. CADWALLADER
Mrs. Cadwallader was tall, with rather full expressive blue eyes, and an unusually pretty face, a striking woman in
any gathering. She wore beautiful cloths, was fond of jewelry, and especially proud of a magnificent string of pearls.
In her home on Loomis Street in Chicago she had a marvelous collection of manuscripts and books on Spiritualism,
and here she entertained prominent Spiritualists from all over the world.
On December 24th
1934, after a long illness, Mrs. M. E. Cadwallader passed on to the Spirit World.

Mrs. Mercy E. Cadwallader was well known, primarily world-wide as editor of The
Progressive Thinker Chicago, which she took control of in 1910 purchasing the paper at the
death of its founder J. R. Francis who originally founded the paper in 1889. Also for her
work in relationship to Hydesville3
and the Fox sisters. On December 5th
1927, she placed a

She was also closely involved with the National Spiritualist Association (N.S.A) organised in
September 1893; in 1894 she was elected honorary Vice-President, which she accepted and then
resigned in favour of being appointed “Missionary”. Cadwallader was a prominent lyceumist it
was through her efforts that the Andrew Jackson Davis Lyceum building was built in 19284
at
Lily Dale, New York. An acre assigned for the children’s playground is known as Cadwallader
Park.
The short note below was published in 1897,5
and gives an interesting account of her early
involvement in publishing as well as her connection with “Antiquity Unveiled” Oriental
Publishing Co., Philadelphia 1892: -6
Mrs. M. E. Cadwallader
Mrs. Cadwallader is perhaps one of the best known lady workers in our
ranks. She has been especially active in the work of the N. S. A., and has done
much toward its permanency. She has been identified with other societies and
aided in other organizations. But her chief accomplishment has been in the
publishing of “Antiquity Unveiled,” she being part of the publishing company
which brought this book to light. Her home is in Philadelphia, where J. M.
Roberts once published “Mind and Matter,” the newspaper in which the first
messages of the afore-named book appeared.Mrs. Cadwallader was already
connected with this paper and from which period her prominence in the cause
began. She is yet a young woman, fine looking, graceful, tall and very
intelligent, earnest and peace loving. She is also a good speaker and has been
heard from many a rostrum in behalf of the N. S. A. Her last important move
has been a visit to England, where she has done some work for the cause
beneficial to all, and of which the readers of this paper will reap the benefit.
Her home address is care of Oriental Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pa.
More less known is her involvement with the Chicago Spiritualists’ League. In 1917 she held the
position of vice-president. The N.S.A., 77 Thirty – first Street, Chicago, Illinois had twenty two
state associations, there were about six hundred subordinate societies connected with these state
associations, the Chicago Spiritualists’ League was one of these subordinate societies connected

TO THE CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS OF THE CHICAGO
SPIRITUALISTS' LEAGUE
We, the Executive Board of the Chicago Spiritualists’ League, the chosen
representatives of that body, in conjunction with the same, in order to form a
more perfect and powerful working organization, establish intelligent co-
operation among the mediums and societies of the City of Chicago, Illinois,

hereby establish this Constitution and By-Laws for the guidance of the Chicago
Spiritualists’ League.
To be a certificated member and practising medium of the Chicago Spiritualists’ League as was
Mrs. Minnie Parsons, was an invaluable advantage if you were to fall victim to the law.

SPIRITUALISM PROTECTED BY LAW
THE MINNIE PARSONS TRIAL
CERTIFICATE OF THE CHICAGO SPIRITUALIST LEAGUE AMPLE
PROTECTION OF HONEST MEDUIMSHIP IN CHICAGO
SYNOPSIS
Mrs. Minnie Parsons, a medium, residing in Chicago, was arrested November 6, 1917,
charged with holding herself out as skilled in fortune-telling by means of spirit mediumship
and occult powers, and obtaining money thereby, in violation of the laws of the State of
Illinois. A day or two prior to the arrest she was visited by two policewomen, acting as
detectives, who sought and obtained a “reading” from her. The trial was had before Judge
Joseph S. LaBuy, one of the judges of the Municipal Court of Chicago. Mrs. Parsons gave
her personal bond for appearance at court, and the first day of the trial was not represented
by counsel.
The policewomen testified that the reading they got from Mrs. Parsons was not all true,
and that it consisted mostly of predictions of the future, for which reading Mrs. Parsons
charged one dollar, which they paid.
Mrs. Parsons said she told the ladies she was not a fortune-teller, did not hold herself out
as such, but was a spirit medium, and a member of the Chicago Spiritualists' League, and had
been granted a certificate of mediumship.
Judge LaBuy postponed the case for a week, telling Mrs. Parsons to bring her certificate
in, and someone from the League, to represent her at the next hearing.
At the next hearing, on November 13, Mr. A. M. Griffen, attorney for the Chicago
Spiritualists’ League, appeared as attorney for Mrs. Parsons. Mrs. Rockwell, one of the
policewomen, took the stand and testified to an interview which she and her associate
detective, Mrs. Cunningham, had had with Dr. Burgess, the president of the League, saying
she had been instructed by the Judge to ascertain what kind of an organization the Chicago
Spiritualists’ League was, so that he might determine whether it was a bona fide corporation.
Mrs. Parsons produced her certificate of membership, which, together with the Constitution
and By-laws of the league, was offered in evidence by Attorney Griffen, who called attention
to the affidavit of incorporation, and maintained that the League was a duly incorporated
religious body under the laws of the State of Illinois; that Mrs. Parsons was an accredited
representative of the religion of Spiritualism, and that as such she came within the provision
of the statute which said that “the provisions of this act shall not be construed to include,
prohibit or interfere with the exercise of the spiritual functions or offices of any priest,
minister or accredited representative of any religion; and, provided further, the provisions of
this act shall not be construed to include or refer to the practice of the belief known as
Spiritualism, or to any attempted communication with the spirit world, by or through so-
called mediums.”
205
Mr. Griffen also contended in his argument that the police nor the court had no more right
to go back of the certificate issued to mediums by an incorporated association of
Spiritualists, a religious body, and inquire what they do in the exercise of their spiritual
function, than they have to go behind the ordination of a priest or minister of any other
religion, to see whether they are violating the law. People have just as much right to go to
mediums to get consolation and solace as they have to go to priests and ministers, and the
law and the Constitution protect them just the same in the exercise of that right; and when
police or officers of the law go into a private house and try to induce a medium to violate the
law, they themselves are equally guilty, and there is a law on the statute books to punish
them.
The Judge turned to the prosecutor and asked if he did not think the medium in the case
before the court came within the exception of the act; to which the prosecutor replied that he
did, if she was a bona fide member of a bona fide society, of which fact, however, he was not
satisfied.
The police officer who had charge of the case told the Judge that the arrest and
prosecution of mediums was started by the Chicago Tribune and the Chief of Police, and that
the police wanted to find out what the law was. The case was again postponed for the
purpose of getting further evidence of the genuineness of the Chicago Spiritualists’ League,
and Mrs. Parsons' membership in it.
At the next hearing, on November 23, the prosecutor stated that if Mrs. Parson was a bona
fide member of the society that gave her the certificate of mediumship, and the society itself
was legitimate, she would come within the exception of the statute.
The Secretary’ of the League, Mrs. Ada C. Drake, was called as a witness, and showed
her books and list of 'mediums belonging to the League, and Mrs. Parsons’ name was among
them.
Mr. Griffen produced the original affidavit which had been filed with the' County
Recorder, showing the legal incorporation of the League as a religious body.
Mrs. Drake testified that there were over three hundred members of the League, and about
forty-four certified mediums. She also testified as to the investigation made of mediums who
wished to become certified by the League, and the qualifications required.
The prosecutor said: “The State contends that if the defendant becomes a member of the
Spiritualists’ League, and holds herself out as a medium, but instead of performing her
functions as a medium tells fortunes, it is a mere subterfuge and is a violation of the law. Mr.
Griffen replied that the law was not against fortune-telling, but against obtaining money by
holding oneself out as being able to tell fortunes by some occult power; that the law was
analagous to the law prohibiting lawyers from advertising their ability to obtain divorces, but
not prohibiting their obtaining divorces; that if the medium had obtained money by false
pretences or a confidence game she could be punished under another law upon complaint of
the party who had been deceived by her, and through such deception had lost his money.
206
The Judge remarked that he always thought a Spiritualist medium ought to possess
extraordinary and wonderful qualifications, and expressed a desire for information on the
subject of mediumship; accordingly, Mr. Griffen called Mrs. M. E. Cadwallader, editor of
The Progressive Thinker, to the stand, who explained that Spiritualism was a system of
religion that proved that those who had passed to the spirit side of life can and do return and
communicate with us; that a medium is one who has powers different from the powers of
ordinary mortals; who has eyes to see things that others cannot see, and ears that can hear
things that others cannot hear, who is able to see our spirit friends and give us
communications from them. She said she believed that everyone has mediumistic gifts, but
not all are developed some mediums are developed to an extraordinary degree, and others not
so well.
As to the system of organization of Spiritualism, Mrs. Cadwallader stated that Modern
Spiritualism dated from the rappings at Hydesville, New York, commencing March 31, 1848,
but that Spiritualism was as old as man; that the first society to be chartered under the
religious law was the First Association of Spiritualists of Philadelphia; that the National
Spiritualists’ Association was organized in September, 1893, at 77 Thirty-first street,
Chicago; that the National Association has some twenty-two State Association auxiliaries, of
which the Illinois State Spiritualist Association was one, and the Chicago Spiritualists’
League was an auxiliary of the State Association; that there are about six hundred local
subordinate societies connected with the various State Associations, and many independent
societies not connected with the National. The National Association has headquarters at
Washington, D. C., and holds annual conventions, one just recently at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel in New York, where audiences of about 1,600 people gathered at the evening services
to hear the speakers and the mediums. That there were some fifty-one Spiritualist meetings in
Chicago, and some churches owned by Spiritualists, besides the headquarters in Washington,
worth about $40,000, a temple in Boston worth $350,000, and a contemplated Memorial
Temple to be built in Washington to cost approximately $100,000. A Catholic Archbishop
had estimated that there were ten millions of Spiritualists in the United States; that the last
Illinois State Convention was held in April last at the West Side Masonic Temple, at which
there were 803 members represented on the floor of the convention, each delegate
representing ten members of auxiliary societies.
The Judge desired to know whether mediums were not expected to confine their work to
giving class readings and readings before public audiences. Mrs. Cadwallader said no; that a
priest or minister does not confine his services to his Sunday work, but his parishioners go to
him, individually, at any time, for comfort and advice. She said if she was in trouble, or had
lost someone dear to her, she would not go to a minister or priest, because they could only
tell her to have faith, and trust in God; that she would go to the medium who could see and
hear the spirits and give her real comfort and consolation; that she would not want that
comfort given before an audience, but privately.
Mrs. Cadwallader was asked by the police officer if Mrs. Parsons had not belonged to the
Chicago Spiritualists’ League, would she say that the reading she gave would be a violation
of the law, and the question was objected to by Mr. Griffin; but the Court permitted the
question to be answered, because he said the witness, being the vice-president of the League,
207
and the editor of The Progressive Thinker, would be competent and know; and he said the
police desired to know who were legitimate mediums and who were not, and those that were
not they were going to clear out. Mrs. Cadwallader said the Spiritualists would help to clear
them out, and if she knew that anyone was using Spiritualism as a cloak to defraud anybody,
and seeking to prostitute the sacred gift of mediumship, she would be the first to see that they
were brought to justice; that Spiritualists would have nothing to do with charlatans.
In closing the case, Mr. Griffen argued that the prosecuting witnesses had not been
deceived, because they did not go to the medium with the expectation or belief that they
would get a communication from departed spirits, and were therefore not deceived nor
defrauded by the medium, and on that question, read from the decision of the Appellate Court
given in the Westergren case, where it was held that one who goes to a medium for the mere
purpose of trapping the medium is not defrauded, and the medium cannot be held guilty of
committing a fraud.
The court in passing on the case said that it had been shown that Mrs. Parsons was a
certified Spiritualist medium, and under the new law had a right to practice her mediumship;
that she had not been shown to be a fortuneteller, and he would have to discharge her. But
every ease would depend upon what is shown to be the facts, and the Court would not say to
the police that this ruling would apply in, all cases, because the facts would be different, and it
would depend upon how far they would go.
Mrs. Parsons was discharged, and one of the policewomen was heard to remark that it was
the League certificate that saved her.

Chicago Spiritualists’ League attorney Griffen, informs us of another case: -
Rights of Certified Mediums of the Chicago Spiritualists' League Again Upheld in
Courts,
By A. M. Griffen
Mrs. Charlotte Longstaff, a certified medium of the Chicago Spiritualists’ League, was
tried on a charge of fortune-telling, at the South Chicago Police Court, on Monday, Jan. 21,
and acquitted. Judge Bernard P. Barasa presided, and held that under the new law spirit
mediums had a right to practice their gifts because that law was not intended to interfere with
religion, and, said the learned judge, Spiritualism is a religion.
Counsel for Mrs. Longstaff first moved to quash the complaint and discharge the
defendant, because it did not set out that she did not come within the provisos of the law. The
Judge said he would hear the evidence, and if she did come within the exceptions made in the
provisos, he would discharge her, and remarked that if it was a matter of the practice of a
religion, or Spiritualism, mediums could not be guilty of fortune-telling.
208
Policeman Patrick Collins then told the Court that he went to Mrs. Longstaff’'s house, by
appointment, for a reading; that she took him into the room, “and closed her eyes, and told
me all about the other world, and the spirits, and so forth, and charged me seventy-five cents
for the services rendered”; and furthermore, Mr. Collins said that what she told him was “all
bunk.” Mrs. Longstaff testified that after the reading Mr. Collins expressed his satisfaction
with the reading.
In summing up the case Judge Barasa read the statute, and remarked that, as it was
written, it was very broad, and was just as clear as it possibly could be; that it protected the
accredited representatives of any religion, and practically includes everything under the name
of religion. “These people,” said he, “are practicing Spiritualism. Even though they get
money, under this law they can keep it. Don't you see how clear it is? What can you do? The
law is there for them, the same as for any other representatives of any other religion.”
The judge then advised the medium to confine her reading to members of her
congregation, apparently being of the opinion that if practiced generally it would be a viola-
tion of the law.

The Illinois law as it stood in 1917: -
What the Illinois Law Says
The following is a copy of the Illinois Statute relating to fortune-telling, mediumship, and so-
forth, under, which the prosecutions of mediums have taken place in Chicago:
“AN ACT to Prohibit Fortune-telling and other practices whereby money is obtained on
the pretense of the exercise of Occult Powers.
“Section 1. Be it enacted, by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the General
Assembly: That whoever shall obtain money or property from another by holding himself out
as skilled in fortune-telling by means of card reading, palmistry, clairvoyancy, astrology,
seership, spirit mediumship or any crafty science, or by any other devices or practices,
Whereby money is obtained from the general public on the pretense of the exercise of occult
or psychic powers, shall for each offense be fined not to exceed five hundred dollars.
Provided, that the provisions of this Act shall not be construed to include, prohibit or
interfere with .the exercise of the spiritual functions or offices of any priest, minister or
accredited representative of any religion; and provided further, the provisions of this Act
shall not be construed to include or refer to the practice of the belief known as Spiritualism,
or to any attempted communication with the spirit world, by or through so-called mediums.
209
“Section 2. That whoever knowingly prints, publishes, distributes or circulates, or
knowingly causes to be printed, published, circulated or advertised, in any newspaper,
periodical, magazine or other publication or publications, or by display signs, circulars,
handbills, or any other means, any advertisement of any person’s ability, skill or power in
telling fortunes or revealing the future, or offering advice of any kind or nature by means of
occult or psychic powers, faculties or forces, shall for each offense be fined not exceeding
two hundred dollars.

In tribute: -
Leigh Hunt 10
gives this tribute to Mrs. Cadwallader in Light January 3rd
1935.
I first met Mrs. Cadwallader considerably over thirty years ago. She was then in the prime of
life, and her visit to England from the United States enabled many prominent Spiritualists on this
side of the Atlantic to make the acquaintance of this versatile and vivacious lady, who, as a
propagandist of Spiritualism "pure and simple," had already earned their keen appreciation.
I particularly remember two other visits Mrs. Cadwallader made to this country, for on each
occasion I sat with her at some memorable seances, at which she proved herself to be an
excellent sitter to Mrs. Everitt, whose remarkable direct-voice Mediumship, with its attendant
phenomena, was never more evident than on those occasions.
There may be a few readers of LIGHT who will remember the spirited address which Mrs.
Cadwallader gave at the L.S.A. reception to American visitors in the banqueting room of the old
St. James' Hall, and another occasion at an L.S.A. conversazione held at the salon of the Royal
Society of British Artists, when her speech and brilliant conversational powers greatly impressed
all present.
Needless to say how deeply interested were her numerous admirers on this side of the Atlantic
in many excellent articles, etc., in which, during her long period of editorship of The
Progressive Thinker, she so bravely and so consistently championed the cause of Spiritualism

Leigh Hunt was strongly connected and past president of the “Marylebone Spiritualist Association” in London. It
was founded at the suggestion of his father in 1872. In 1928 Hunt wrote: - The Story of the Marylebone Spiritualist
Association, Its Works & Workers’ (1872 – 1928). This has been published by Psypioneer, see Volume 2.12 page

“with the spirits” as a set-off to those would-be scientific contributors to her paper and others
who seemed a little inclined to "shelve the spirits" in their dissertations on psychic matters.
“All hail,” but not "farewell" to this distinguished advocate of Spiritualism – to this good
friend of all earnest seekers after "the truth that makes us free." I can well visualise her meeting
on the “other side of the veil" with Andrew Jackson Davis, J. M. Peebles, J. J. Morse, Mrs.
Emma Hardinge Britten, and a host of other notable protagonists of the truth of spirit-return, and
can almost hear her say, as she said to me when last I met her: "We are brothers and sisters all, in
the furtherance of the greatest truth that has ever come to mankind.”

Did HPB Predict a World Teacher?
By
John Cooper
John Cooper has lectured on religious studies at the University of Sydney, specializing in Indian
Buddhism and Indian Ideas, and has recently become a farmer on the south coast of New South
Wales, where he will edit the Collected Letters of H. P. Blavatsky. In 1977 he completed a major
thesis on “The Theosophical Crisis in Australia, 1913-1923.”
Note by Psypioneer: -
The origin and purposes of the Theosophical Society and related bodies are the subject of ongoing
research by our friends at the quarterly journal “Theosophical History” 11
. Madame Blavatsky
(“HPB”), a co-founder, wrote many letters, but sadly John Cooper passed away before he could carry
out the project to edit them. Dr John Algeo led a team which published the first volume so far. The
article below, kindly made available by “The American Theosophist” Sept-Oct. 1988 assesses a
theory which had become popular about the reasons why the T.S. was founded.
_____
In the two major biographies of Jiddu Krishnamurti we find the following statements:
As early as 1889, Madame Blavatsky had told a group of Theosophical students
that the real purpose of establishing the (Theosophical) Society was to prepare
humanity for the reception of the World Teacher when he appeared again on earth.
(1)
11
www.theohistory.org
211
Madame Blavatsky had regarded it as the mission of the T.S. to prepare the world
for the coming of the next great Teacher. (2)
Towards the end of the nineteenth century whispers of the coming of the Messiah
or the World Teacher had spread amongst occult communities. HPB had written
before her death in 1891 that the real purpose of the Theosophical Society was to
prepare for the advent of the World Teacher (3)
These two excellent biographies were published in 1975 and 1986 respectively. To the best of my
knowledge these statements have not been discussed or refuted by historians or members of the
theosophical movement. Yet they are vitally important to our understanding of both Theosophy and
the Theosophical Society. Many writers in the past argued that the messianic thrust of the Order of
the Star in the East was in direct contradiction to the teachings of Blavatsky and often quoted her as
follows:
With the advent of Theosophy, the Messiah-craze surely has had its day, and sees
its door (4)
One possible reason why this issue has not been debated is because no clear references are given
for these statements and it is very difficult to prove that Blavatsky did not make a statement when we
take into consideration the volume of her writings. Yet if we look at the early years of the Order of
the Star in the East we can discover the source of this legend and just exactly what was claimed to be
said by Blavatsky.
In The Vahan early in 1912 Annie Besant stated that the T.S. is the Herald of the coming Teacher.
An English Theosophist Mrs. M. H. Charles challenged this statement and Mrs. Besant wrote in
reply:
It may interest members to recall the fact that Mme. Blavatsky, one of the Founders
of the T.S., regarded it as the mission of the T.S. to prepare the world for the coming
of the next great Teacher, though she put that event perhaps half a century later than I
do. Which of us is right as to date, only time can show. (5)
Mrs. Besant quotes as her source The Key to Theosophy by H. P. Blavatsky, which was first
published in 1889, the date given in our first quotation. In this letter Mrs. Besant then quotes from the
last paragraph of the Key.
The next impulse will find a numerous and united body of people, ready to welcome
the new torch-bearer of Truth. He will find the minds of men prepared for his message,
a language ready for him in which to clothe the new truths he brings, an organisation
awaiting his arrival, which will remove the merely mechanical, material obstacles and
difficulties from his path (6)
This exchange of letters led to a further letter from an Indian Theosophist, J. J. Vimadalal, who wrote:
It must have been a surprise to the older members of the T.S. to be told by Mrs. Besant
that H.P.B. regarded it “as the mission of the T.S. to prepare the world for the Coming
212
of the next Great Teacher,” I have carefully read through that chapter and may say
with confidence that there is absolutely nothing in it to justify the President’s
statement. In the first place, H.P.B. is not throughout the chapter speaking of the
coming of “the next Great Teacher” at all, but is merely referring to the attempt made
during the last quarter of every century to revive spirituality through “one or more
persons who appear in the world as the agents of the Masters.” (8)
The words quoted by the President, viz, “the New Torch-Bearer of Truth” refer only
to such a person and are in no sense intended to allude to a great Teacher like the
Christ. (9)
Mr. Vimadalal then quotes from Bhagavan Das:
I am not aware of any statement by her (H.P.B.) about the near advent of a World-
Teacher in the sense in which that expression is being freely used nowadays. (10)
Here it should be stated that Blavatsky stated clearly in the Key that the messenger will not come until
the last quarter of this century. Mrs. Besant replied to this letter and wrote:
The rare occasions of the coming of a World-Teacher do not fall into this “fixed law of
cycles.” The last coming was not in the last quarter of a century. (11)
This means that Annie Besant is referring to a different occult cycle-that of the return of the Avatars
whereas H.P.B. is dealing with a 100 year cycle of Messengers.
Then Mrs. Besant wrote:
That the Teacher will be a greater one than she (H.P.B.) expected does not touch the
question. (12)
Here we have a total refutation, by Annie Besant, that Madame Blavatsky prophesied the near coming
of a world teacher. Blavatsky was writing about a Messenger who would come in the last quarter of this
century in order to spread further the teachings of Theosophy. (13) This is a very different story to that of
proclaiming the Advent of the Messiah.
From the above we can see that Blavatsky did not predict that the real purpose of the Theosophical
Society was to prepare for the advent of the World-Teacher.

Frederic W.H. Myers Online: II. Original
Writings
Carlos S. Alvarado
In the second part of this bibliographical essay I focus on Myers’ writings. A list of references
freely available online, with web links, follows the following comments.
Myers’ best known work is his Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (1903).
He stated in the first page of the original edition: “The question for man most momentous of all
is whether or not he has an immortal soul; or . . . whether or not his personality involves any
element which can survive bodily death” (Vol. 1, p. 1). The book circulated widely in France and
in other European countries in the 1905 abridged translation La personnalité humaine, sa
survivance, ses manifestations supranormales.
While Myers’ first major paper as a single author appeared in 1884, he co-authored several
papers in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research starting in 1882 as a committee
member of the Society’s committees, such as the Committee on Mesmerism.
Myers participated in the first major project of the Society for Psychical Research, Gurney,
Myers, and Podmore’s Phantasms of the Living (1886). He wrote in the introduction to this
volume that if telepathy was accepted, this would present “a serious obstacle to the materialistic
synthesis of human experience” (Vol. 1, p. l). Myers further wrote: “I claim at least that any
presumption which science had established against the possibility of spiritual communion is now
rebutted; and that inasmuch as it can no longer be affirmed that our minds are closed to all
influences save such as reach them through sensory avenues, the Materialist must admit that it is

no longer an unsupported dream but a serious scientific possibility . . . .” (Vol. 1, p. li). An
abridged translation of the book was published by Félix Alcan in 1891 with a preface from
Charles Richet. This translation, available in the list below, was entitled Les hallucinations
télépathiques.
There are also links to many papers Myers wrote, such as his first series of important articles
published in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research during the 1880s: “On a
Telepathic Explanation of Some So-Called Spiritualistic Phenomena” (1884), “Automatic
Writing – II” (1885), “Automatic Writing – III” (1887), and “Automatic Writing - IV. - The
Daemon of Socrates (1889). In the 1884 paper Myers suggested that “some of the effects which
Spiritualists ascribe to spirits are referable to the unconscious action of the writer's own mind”
(p. 237). In the 1885 paper he said that some mediumistic communications received through
automatic writing involved the medium’s secondary self “which is apparently neither fugitive
nor incidental merely—a delirium or a dream—but may possess, for a time at least, a kind of
continuous individuality, a purposive activity of its own” (p. 27).
These papers were followed by a series of articles entitled “The Subliminal Consciousness,”
published between 1892 and 1895. Translations into French are available online in the Annales
des sciences psychiques, published between 1897 to 1902. In the first 1892 paper, “The
Subliminal Consciousness: Chapter I. General Characteristics of Subliminal Messages,” Myers
presented his often cited statement about the subliminal mind:
I suggest . . . that the stream of consciousness in which we habitually live is not
the only consciousness which exists in connection with our organism. Our
habitual or empirical consciousness may consist of a mere selection from a
multitude of thoughts and sensations, of which some at least are equally
conscious with those that we empirically know. I accord no primacy to my
ordinary waking self, except that among my potential selves this one has shown
itself the fittest to meet the needs of common life. I hold that it has established
no further claim, and that it is perfectly possible that other thoughts, feelings,
and memories, either isolated or in continuous connection, may now be actively
conscious, as we say, “within me,”--in some kind of co-ordination with my
organism, and forming some part of my total individuality. I conceive it possible
that at some future time, and under changed conditions, I may recollect all; I
may assume these various personalities under one single consciousness, in
which ultimate and complete consciousness the empirical consciousness which
at this moment directs my hand may be only one element out of many (p. 301).
But Myers wrote many other articles. Among the most important were: “Human Personality
in the Light of Hypnotic Suggestion” (1886), “On Telepathic Hypnotism, and its Relation to
Other Forms of Hypnotic Suggestion” (1886), “Note on a Suggested Mode of Psychical
Interaction (1886), “Multiplex Personality (1887), and “On Indications of Continued Terrene
Knowledge on the Part of Phantasms of the Dead” (1892). Writing in the first paper listed in this
paragraph about empirical studies of the mind, Myers said:
216
Pre-eminently important . . . is the study of abnormal, and, I may add, of
supernormal, mental and physical conditions of all kinds. First come the
spontaneous states; sleep and dreams, somnambulism, trance, hysteria,
automatism, alternating consciousness, epilepsy, insanity, death and dissolution.
Then parallel with these spontaneous states runs another series of induced states;
narcotism, hypnotic catalepsy, hypnotic somnambulism, and the like, which
afford, as though by a painless and harmless psychical vivisection, an
unequalled insight into the mysteries of man. Then, again, after studying the
machinery thus thrown slightly out of gear, after isolating and exaggerating one
process after another for more convenient scrutiny, we may return to those
normal states which lie open to our habitual introspection, having gained a new
power of disentangling each particular thread in the complex of mentation, as
when the microscopist stains his object with a dye that affects one tissue only
among several which are indiscernibly intermixed. (pp. 1-2)
Myers also wrote articles for publications that did not specialize in psychical research.
Among these are those in which he was second author with Edmund Gurney, “Phantasms of the
Living” (1883), and “Visible Apparitions” (1884).
In addition, Myers’ legacy includes many critiques and comments about the work of many
psychologists and psychical researchers. Some of his writings on the work of psychologists
included comments about French developments, as well as about developments in other
countries. Examples include: “Professor Pierre Janet’s ‘Automatisme Psychologique’ ” (1889),
“Binet on the Consciousness of Hysterical Subjects” (1889), “Dr. Jules Janet on Hysteria and
Double Personality” (1889), “Das Doppel-Ich” (1889, by Max Dessoir), “The Principles of
Psychology” (1891, by William James), and “Dr. Morton Prince’s ‘Experimental Study of
Visions’ ” (1899).
Myers had many hopes for the future. Some of them were expressed in the 1894 paper “The
Drift of Psychical Research:”
I believe . . . that the central task of experimental psychology during
the coming century will be the discussion of some such theses as the
following . . . .
1. There exists in each of us a subliminal self; that is to say, a certain
part of our being, conscious and intelligent, does not enter into our ordinary
waking intelligence, nor rise above our habitual threshold of consciousness,
into our supraliminal life.
2. This subliminal self exerts supernormal faculties—faculties, that is
to say, which apparently transcend our known level of evolution. Some of
these . . . seem to be extensions of faculties already known. Others . . .
altogether exceeds our supraliminal range of powers . . . .
217
3. This subliminal knowledge and faculty, apprehended or exercised
beneath the threshold of ordinary consciousness, may be made in part
supraliminal, or conveyed to our consciousness above the threshold, by
means of sensory or motor automatism . . . . By all these means messages are
conveyed from the subliminal to the supraliminal self; messages which may
have arisen in the subliminal self, or may have been inspired by other minds.
4. In the . . . transcendental environment, where telepathy operates,
many intelligences may affect our own. Some of these are the minds of living
persons; but some appear to be discarnate . . . . These spirits appear still to
have some knowledge of our world, and to be in certain ways able to affect it
. . . .
5. The messages which reach us from beneath the threshold, whether
inspired by our own subliminal selves or by external intelligences, although
mixed with much of triviality and confusion, are on the whole concordant,
and on the whole coincide with such intellectual and moral inferences as we
may logically draw from the actual observation of telepathy, and of other
supernormal powers. (pp. 732-733)

For some years I have been trying to establish the true identities of the various pseudonyms in
the Light journals. One popular writer in these journals was indicated simply with the initials
T.W., this writer frequently wrote in Light for well over a decade, some weeks I have noted as
many as three letters/articles in one single issue.
He was, by his own words in the early 1890’s an aged ardent Spiritualist of long standing. He
wrote on many aspects of philosophical and phenomenal Spiritualism. In the mid 1890’s, he
dispensed with his pseudonym and started to use his name, Wm. R. Tomlinson, M.A.
His obituary revealed that he was the Rev. Wm. R. Tomlinson, late rector of Sherfield English,
Hants. He was the son of Admiral Nicholas Tomlinson, and died on the 6th
February 1899 at his
residence, ‘Briarswood,’ Weymouth at the age of 88. His last contribution appeared in Light on
January 14th

SPIRITISM ON THE CONTINENT AND IN ENGLAND
HAVING lived for the most part in France and Italy from 1853 to 1865, and having studied
Spiritism there, nothing surprised me more, on returning to England in the latter year, than to
find that English Spiritualists were not re-incarnationists, when all the Spiritists apparently of
those who had been trained in the Roman and Greek churches professed a belief in the doctrine
of reincarnation. I could not understand it, and it was a great grief to me, this apparent split in the
camp, although, I found, the split was only essentially so on this one point. I, however, found
that the doctrine of reincarnation was freely discussed, in a friendly spirit, in the English
Spiritualist journals, and very ably maintained by Miss Anna Blackwell in those early days or
soon after; although for the last few years it seems to have simply languished and died out in the
old sense here.
HOW THE DIFFERENCE CAME ABOUT.
It is well to seek how this difference of opinion on one point has come about, although it is
more difficult to find the reason. But the fact is that those who have been brought up in the
Protestant churches of England and America, for no specific reason that has accrued, have taken
one line, and those of the Roman and Greek Churches another; and it is thus throughout Europe
and North and South America; so that, as I had occasion to remark in a periodical of June, 1893:
“May it not be safely stated that ninety-nine out of every hundred in the Roman and Greek
Churches, when they assume Spiritism, turn re-incarnationists; while ninety-nine out of every
hundred Protestants, when they assume Spiritualism, remain non re-incarnationists? Meanwhile,
in other respects, their opinions are almost identical; and reincarnation, as now promulgated in
England, comes almost solely through the Theosophists, with the flavour of the far, far East,
while earlier European re-incarnation, like the teaching of Jesus, is marked by the identification
of the soul of Elijah with that of John the Baptist.”

THE WORK OF ALLAN KARDEC
Allan Kardec, whose true name was Lion Rivail, and who has been long dead, wrote several
books in which Re-incarnation was ever the main topic. These books were irrespective of his
monthly, La Revue Spirite. They were all translated, and well translated, by Miss Blackwell, and
have been all along, and still are, advertised by Light as “Re-incarnationist.” But apparently there
is not any great call for them.
And whence did Allan Kardec obtain his teachings? It appears probable that about 1848 he
was attracted by a book, published in English and French, by the late Due de Normandie in 1839,
called, in English, “The Heavenly Doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ,” which was Spiritism
throughout, and just to the purpose of Kardec.
THE INFLUENCE OF THE DUC DE NORMANDIE
The Duke, a man of great talent and an earnest Spiritist at the time he published this book,
had been banished from France to England by Louis Philippe, in 1836, because he was bringing
a lawsuit in Paris against the deposed king of France, Charles X., for not acknowledging him as
his nephew. I speak of him as the Due do Normandie, because he always assumed that name in
France and England from the time that he arrived in Paris from Prussia, in 1833. For the nine
years he was in our country he mostly inhabited Camberwell. And he was buried as “Louis
XVII., Due de Normandie,” at Delft, in Holland, where he died in August, 1845, after a painful
illness. He himself believed that he had been poisoned.
I have written several letters in Light on this subject since my first of December 25th, 1886. In
Light of October 26th, 1889,16
I began a letter thus: “It was, I think, a great mistake to assume
that Allan Kardec was the founder of Modern Spiritualism at the late Paris Congress.” And, in
the same year, through the courtesy of the office of Light, I found myself in possession of a book
of 350 pages, bearing on its title page all this: “The Heavenly Doctrine of Our Lord Jesus Christ
in all its Primitive Purity, Newly Revealed by three Angels of the Lord. Promulgated by Charles
Louis, Duke of Normandie, son of Louis XVI., king of France.” I at once sent some tidings of
this work to M f. Leymarie,17
the editor of La Revue Spirite. And now, lately having found a
French edition of the work, he is publishing excerpts from it in his Review; while Lady
Caithness is, I hear, republishing the whole of the book in her periodical, L’Aurore. The Duke
also, while in England, wrote three other books under the influence of spirits.
As you are about to touch upon this strange history, I am tempted to bring before you all
explanatory passage of his opinions, which demonstrates the author of “The Heavenly-
Doctrine,” published in 1839, as the first Spiritist and re-incarnationist writer and medium in
Europe of this century as regards date.

WHAT IS MEANT BY RE-INCARNATION?
Without staying to question whether Re-incarnation can be interpreted as the resurrection of
the body, I will simply recapitulate a short summary of the Re-incarnationist doctrines of the Duc
de Normandie, first published in the year 1839.
I need only give an epitome of the faith taught by spirits to the Duke, to show its close
analogy to the opinions adopted by Allan Kardec in the year 1850. I take from La Légitimiét, a
weekly journal published at Bordeaux, and devoted entirely to the cause of the descendants of
the Duke. It is edited, and has been so for the last thirteen years, by a man of talent, the Abbé
Dupuy. The Abbé is a good Catholic, and, of course, is shocked at the Duke’s opinions, but he
published them nevertheless. These opinions were concisely drawn up by the Comte Gruau de la
Baure, who lived with the Duke of Normandy during his nine years’ residence in England, and
was with him at his death, in Holland. He was alive in 1880, and had much to do with
establishing La Légitimiét newspaper. Here are, shortly, these opinions as given in La Légitimiét
of December 12th, 1880, which I here translate: -
First, the Eternal is one God only, and not a God in three persons. Secondly, all souls were
created in Heaven before the foundation of the earth, and it is they who compose humanity by
their habitation in the bodies born of men here below. Thirdly, all men are sons of God, like
Jesus Christ, by the spirit and the soul which constitute their immortal beings, and sons of men
by the mortal body, which comes back earth; while their spiritual person continues its terrestrial
career in other human bodies, until it has accomplished the will of God in this globe. Fourthly,
Jesus Christ, made Lord of this world by the Eternal, his Celestial Father, is our elder brother of
Heaven, whence we are descended and whither we shall return according to the merit of our
works, by remounting successively through all the heavens, which are the dwellings of our
Heavenly Father, and through which we must pass in order to gain Heaven. Fifthly, we shall all
be saved at a given period in eternity.”
THE FATE OF THE DUKE
There are allusions, in BORDERLAND of October, to the long and hard imprisonments suffered
by the Due de Normandie during his youth and early manhood, through the jealousy of
Napoleon, and not less on the supposition, well originated, of his being the Dauphin, who under-
went the historical tortures in the Temple prison, at an earlier date, in Paris. I am led to request
space for an interesting and touching passage from “The Heavenly Doctrine,” anent the personal
condition of this first pronounced European medium of the Century-:
“Why,” asked I of the Angel, “does the merciful God make choice of me?-of me, who am the
poorest in spirit?-of me, who know nothing, and am prosecuted by enemies powerful on earth,
and who certainly, on account of my misfortunes, will not believe that which thou and the other
angel have said to me hitherto?”
“It is exactly by thy misfortunes,” answered the Angel to me, “that thou hast found grace
before the Almighty; it is on account of thy unheard of sufferings that thou hast been chosen by
the wisdom of God for the instrument of his justice. . . . Thou hast lost, by the death of thy
230
parents, what the people of the earth call wealth and power; but the wisdom of God has saved
thee, for if thou hasty always been near a throne the magnificence of which loses so many souls,
through the perfidy of those who surround it, thou wouldst have been the one of thy race that
would have done the greatest harm, surpassing in it all the rest, thy predecessors.”
Queen Marie Antoinette, in describing her son to a new governess, speaks of him as a very
impulsive, self willed child, from whom the word “pardon” could never be extracted.
The Due de Normandie had five sons, the eldest of whom died in early manhood without
issue; and only one is now living. There are grandchildren of this unfortunate man also living.
There are photographs of the four younger sons of the Due de Normandie. The likeness of all of
them in profile to Louis XVI. and Louis XVIII. is striking.

‘Allan Kardec was the founder of Modern Spiritualism’
Paul J. Gaunt comments: -
Picking up on Tomlinson’s remark: - “It was, I think, a great mistake to assume that Allan
Kardec was the founder of Modern Spiritualism at the late Paris Congress.” What Tomlinson is
referring to here, took place on the 9th
- 15th
September 1889, in the Great Hall of the Grand
Orient de France, Rue de Cadet. In the January 200718
issue of Psypioneer, we published Mr.
Everitt’s report on The Paris Congress of Spiritists and Spiritualists, he was at this time the
representative of ‘The London Spiritualist Alliance’ (L.S.A.).
The initial report we published by Everitt and the reports we gave from ‘Light’ looked
promising for a union to establish a fundamental basis for all Spiritists and Spiritualists.
However, the congress in general terms did not end harmoniously, as it did not establish by far, a
fundamental working basis between the Spiritists and Spiritualists.
The Paris congress was hailed a triumph for Spiritism with much of this being published by M.
Leymarie, in the Révue Spirite. He made these remarks after they held its first propaganda
meeting after the congress, this took place on October 7th
: -
“Spiritists felt they were doing rightly in setting aside, till after further
examination, the grave question of a universal alliance between Spiritualists and
Spiritists; they wished first to realise the fact of confederation among themselves,
and when this is established to extend it so as to include all their brethren in the
other countries of the world. We are of a different opinion, and we think that
18

231
universal alliance, the idea of which has commended itself to the 12,000,000
Spiritualists of the United States, to all those in England, and in Australia, to
those represented by the Dutch, Russian, Saxon, German, and Bavarian journals,
ought to have been acceptable to the Congress."
Discontentment amongst Spiritualists occurred with the conference claims that ‘Allan Kardec was
the founder of Modern Spiritualism’ 19
Readers of our Kardec series which started in the November 2008 issue20
will have noted that I
remarked on the different first edition dates of The Spirits' Book. These have varied by only a
couple of years and have been regarded as relatively unimportant: - Leymarie 1855,
Alexander Aksakof 1856, Dr. Alexander Moreira-Almeida 1857, (2nd (revised) 1860). The
translator of the book Anna Blackwell gave 1857 as the date for the revised edition.
Kardec’s, The Spirits' Book is generally marked as the beginning of Kardecism -Spiritism. In
this aspect the correct date would be of historic interest. The claim that ‘Allan Kardec was the
founder of Modern Spiritualism’ would on the surface be historically untrue and a rather silly
remark! The words; Spiritualists, mediums, circles and séances go back to the days of the early
Mesmerists. The start of what was to became called “Modern Spiritualism”, is generally
accepted as 1850c the actual date, and who actually coined this name is uncertain.
Below is published 21
two letters regarding firstly, the American representative’s response to the
conference claim regarding Kardec, as the founder of Modern Spiritualism. Secondly a reply
from Anna Blackwell supporting the claim: -
In further reference to the absurd claim made by the Spiritists at the Paris
Congress, Mr. Henry Lacroix, who represented the American Spiritualists on the
occasion, has addressed the following letter to Galignani's Messenger.22
It ought
to be unnecessary, in the face of history, to make any refutation of a claim that
attracts attention only from the fact that it ever occurred to anybody to make it, and
to any assembly of Spiritists to admit its validity: -
SIR,-For the information of those who may wish to have the right side of the
Kardec question, the other side being explained by Miss Anna Blackwell, in her
letter to this paper, 21st inst., I would add the following :
Allan Kardec is not the founder of Modern Spiritualism Andrew Jackson Davis
was the first who issued a most important and large work, entitled Nature's Divine
Revelation, dictated to him by spirits, published in New York city at the beginning
of 1845. Prior even to Kardec, and almost simultaneously with Davis, Cahagnet
19
This claim I believe backdates to the previous years congress held in September 1888 at Barcelona

published Les Arcanes de le Vie Future Dévoilés, translated afterwards and
published in the United States under the title of Celestial Telegraph.
The first edition of Kardec's work, The Spirits' Book, in two-column pages,
appeared only in 1856, and not in 1851, as Miss Blackwell erroneously states.
Kardec, besides, was perfectly aware of the American movement, and his
colleagues as well, as I can prove. I was in correspondence with him at the time,
and I have those letters still, in which he refers to the American manifestations.
Therefore, Miss Blackwell is wrong also on that second point.
The second edition of The Spirits' Book appeared only in 1858, at the same
time as the Revue Spirite. Kardec became initiated only in 1855, at the same time
as Judge J. W. Edmonds, of New York, Emma Hardinge, myself, and hosts of
others. He then became a member of a circle held in the Rue des Martyrs, Paris,
which had been established in 1850 by M. Sardou, sen., now aged eighty-nine,
who lives at Nice, and is the father of the great dramatic author, Victorien; M.
Tiedeman Marthèze. ex-Governor of Java; Saint Rene Taillandier, Academician;
M. Didier, editor and printer of the French Academy, and others. That circle held
seances every other day, and being composed of scholars, serious investigations
were carried on there, with the active co-operation of many mediums.
Kardec was unanimously chosen by the members of that circle to compile the
immense number of communications received and arrange them in proper order.
He selected those which bore a character of continuity, and by questioning the
spirits on ambiguous questions, and obtaining explanations through mediums, he
finally was enabled to give the world, first, The Spirits' Book.
The above information I hold from a good, reliable source from the archives of the
mother society, written by Allan Kardec himself, being the History of Spiritism,
which he left unfinished.
As to the translation made by Miss Anna Blackwell, I am requested to state, by
an interested party, that the renderings in English of the three works thus presented
are wanting in various ways. Throughout, for instance, the word soul is styled it, in
the neuter gender, while the word spirit is styled he, in the masculine. That error is
deplorable, because in the English language the term he is essentially masculine
and cannot represent the two active genders, as il in French. It must be borne in
mind that the word at can alone answer in this case (neuter), and cannot be
confounded with the term he (masculine), while in French the pronoun il (or he)
serves equally to designate the masculine and the neuter.
HENRY LACROIX.

Miss Anna Blackwell’s response: -
TO THE EDITOR OF Galignani's Messenger
SIR,-For the information of those who may be interested in the matter, kindly
allow me to say that Mr. Henry Lacroix is mistaken in supposing, as he is stated to
do in your issue of this morning, that “Modern Spiritualism had been practised in
America many years before Allan Kardec took up the subject in France.” In point
of fact, it was my account of the experiences then taking place in the Fox family, in
America, published by Baron du Potet, in his Journal du Magnétisme, in the
spring of 1850, that constituted the first mention, on this side of the Channel, of
what has come to be known as “Modern Spiritualism.” Several editions of that
number of the journal were eagerly bought up; and to the curiosity thus excited, in
connection with the sudden outbreak of “table-turning” and its accompanying
phenomena, that took place about the same time, is due the “spiritist” movement
initiated by Allan Kardec's publication of The Spirits' Book, in 1851. This
movement, propagated with unparalleled rapidity, was carried on under his
leadership all over Europe with no more knowledge on his part of the American
movement than had the leaders of that movement across the ocean of the
movement inaugurated by him on the Continent of Europe. Thus, the “spiritist”
movement (of which the leading characteristic is the acceptance of the doctrine of
re-incarnation with its all-embracing consequences), and the “Spiritualistic”
movement (of which the leading characteristic is the rejection of this doctrine)
were begun, and have been going on, independently of each other, but
simultaneously, from the commencement of the “modern movement” until the
present time.
Not venturing to encroach any further on your valuable space, I beg to refer all
those who may desire to know the details of the road by which Allan Kardec was
occultly led to the views which have made his name “a household word” in so
many lands, to the notice of his life and labours contained in the preface of my
translation of his great work, The Spirits' Book, and giving his history, from his
earliest youth to his interment in the burial-ground of Montmartre, whence his
mortal remains were subsequently transferred to their present and final resting
place in the cemetery of Pro-La chaise.-Yours, &e.,
Triel, Seine-et-Oise, Anna Blackwell.
September 17th 1889.
_______________
234
If this statement by Blackwell is correct, it would give a completely different historic position to
Kardec’s early Spiritualistic involvement. Henry Lacroix, states that Blackwell used the wrong
date for the first publication of The Spirits' Book, but Blackwell re-affirmed that the first
edition was 1851! This would mean that Kardec’s Spiritism started much earlier than the
previous articles in this series would suggest? Or maybe that the original, much smaller
first publication of The Spirits' Book was perhaps very limited in the number of copies,
and did not at this time generate any great impact. As Leymarie Stated:23
- “In 1855 the
Spirits’ Book was first published, many additions were subsequently made to it up to the year
1858, when it appeared in its complete form, such as we have it at present.” Once the
revised edition was published and became a great success in 1857c this much larger book
became regarded as the beginnings of Kardecism and was perceived as the first edition?
Tomlinson also states an earlier period: - ……. the opinions adopted by Allan Kardec in the year
1850.
So just which year, and which edition of Kardec’s book, Le Livre des Esprits (The Spirits’
Book) actually commences Spiritism?

Dear Paul,
Many thanks for sharing with me this paper.
That article makes it clear that Kardec and his works have not been studied in depth and have
been misunderstood (even by Spiritists) since those old times.
Kardec never claimed to have created Spiritualism. On the opposite, he stated several times that
Spiritualism was born in US. He created a specific way to investigate mediums and get reliable
information regarding spirits. To name this approach, he created the term Spiritism at the
Introduction of the Spirits’ Book.
Kardec always emphasized similarities and a partnership that should be built between
Spiritualists and Spiritists.
His research methods have been grossly misunderstood and misrepresented (again, even by
Spiritists). They can be grasped by reading Revue Spirite (a kind of Proceedings of Kardec’s
works) and also the first chapter of his last book, published in 1868: “Genesis”. I’ve worked on a
paper to try to explain clearly Kardec’s methods. I hope to have a first draft of it in a few months.
Kardec also often stressed that many other authors, philosophers, and religious people
throughout history have proposed many of Spiritism’s principles. The difference would be that
Spiritism would have established these principles not by mere speculation, but based on a
rigorous scientific investigation of spiritual phenomena.
To my knowledge, there is no evidence that Due de Normandie had influenced Kardec. Kardec
often cited in his Revue Spirite many precursors of Spiritism’s ideas, but did not cite this Duke.
The excellent book “Secular Spirituality – Reincarnation and Spiritism in Nineteenth-Century
France” by Lynn Sharp describes how French romantic socialists and thinkers in France
disseminated the idea of reincarnation at the first decades of XIX Century.
To solve the “mystery” of the real date of publication of Spirits' Book it is only needed to read
what Kardec himself wrote about that.
As I had wrote previously, the first edition was in 1857 and the second on 1860. There are no
editions in 1851, 1855, 1856, 1858... I would like to see a copy of any of them if they exist.
Some private Kardec’s writings were published in 1890 in a book called Oeuvres Posthumes. In
this book, Kardec wrote that he first heard about turning tables in 1854, but that he attended a
mediumistic séance for the first time in May 1855. He also stated that the first edition of Spirits’
Book was in press in January 1857.
At the first issue of Revue Spirite (January 1858), he published several book reviews about
Spirits’ Book that were in several magazines and journals between April and June of 1857.
Revue Spirite April 1869 (the last one written by Kardec):
236
“La doctrine du Livre des Esprits, publié en 1857, et qui est en outre développée dans lês autres
ouvrages fondamentaux.”
Regarding the second edition:
Revue Spirite March 1860: Kardec announces the second edition of Spirits' Book:
EN VENTE: Le Livre des Esprits. Seconde édition - ENTIÈREMENT REFONDUE ET
CONSIDÉRABLEMENT AUGMENTÉE.
Avis sur cette nouvelle édition. (...)
Revue Spirite September 1860: Kardec states that the second edition was published in March
1860 AVIS.
La seconde édition du Livre des Esprits, publiée au mois de mars 1860, a été épuisée en quatre
mois. Une 3° édition vient de paraître. ALLAN KARDEC.
