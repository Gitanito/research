I was in a warm and very comfortable place.  I was not on this earth, but in dark space.  I had the feeling that I had been here before, like I was home at last.  I had no eyes that I could tell but I could see in every direction at the same time. Not only could I see but also I knew what was around me - I had many more senses than smell, sight, hearing, speech, etc., - and an ocean of knowledge. I had no knowledge of earth or my wife or son and saw no people.
