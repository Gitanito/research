this the organization&#39;s invisible
organization
they hold Gregory today
a very good question he&#39;s asking you
know this this group magi magic control
the majority committee Joint
Intelligence Committee is what it is
called
that&#39;s where magic comes from Maj I see
they do have meetings it&#39;s actually
transnational they&#39;re people from other
countries involved with it not just us
always has been transnational the u.s.
is key because it&#39;s the economic and
technological powerhouse but Great
Britain is also very important in all
this and you know there are various
people who have been on the senior
committee such as Admiral Bobby Ray
Inman I know for a fact he was the head
of the National Security Agency prior to
that he was deputy director CIA and then
he became a board member of science
applications international corporation
so I know a number of the people I met
with some of the people who were on this
group including people who are deep
covering the CIA and elsewhere and
former members of Congress and other
SAIC executives I&#39;ve met with but you
know it&#39;s also very compartmented so in
other words you may have two or three
hundred people on this in this group
that are the sort of committee but even
within that it&#39;s a pyramid and there
there&#39;s compartments within it not all
of them know what everything going on
it&#39;s not like it&#39;s an all-access pass
and so and some have gone rogue
splintered off and kind of gone rogue
even within the rogue rogues of the
rogue if you get my drift
which is why it&#39;s so dangerous
and you know I could draw a whole
diagram of it but you can you can kind
of imagine some of the key people you
know more recently
General Michael Hayden has been involved
with that committee
who
had been NSA had CI director so some of
these people are known in the public
most aren&#39;t and what I would say is that
a lot of the folks who are in the
corporate contracting world that what&#39;s
called WFO worked for others contracting
are key to this I remember years ago
right before I was going to have the
meeting with the Clinton CIA director I
was in Arizona at the Wrigley mansion
the wriggling chewing gum people but it
had been bought by Geordi Hormel of the
Hormel meat company and there was a man
who was a member of this magic mj-12
they used to call it group and he asked
me to come to the mansion late at night
10 11 o&#39;clock at night I went there and
it was a Geordi Hormel was nowhere
around they were just using the facility
and this was a high-tech digital guy and
who actually moves around in the UFO
subculture and we were at this table it
looked like a big conference table and
all these suits were there in people and
they were basically you know telling me
that I was barking up the wrong tree
meeting with the CIA director and this
man pulled me aside he says he said to
me the CIA director and president
doesn&#39;t know about this and they&#39;re not
going to know anything about it if you
want to know about what&#39;s really going
on come talk to people like us and
that&#39;s there was a whole room full of
folks like that spooky and then it was
interesting because you know a couple
years before the former head of army
intelligence had offered me two billion
dollars if I would stop doing what I was
doing
closed my operation and join his group
he had a two billion dollar slush fund
out of Eastern Europe and I said no
thank you
and that was when a billion dollars was
a lot of money and when I refused and he
went to my wife
try to convince my wife that I should do
this but this was 2 years later and this
guy said you know what and this is how
they operate we checked you out you know
you&#39;re a doctor you have really good
credit take out all the credit cards you
want and you can run all your operations
max them out each month because my group
we run the supercomputers that back up
the global financial system and we&#39;ll
just zero them out every month that&#39;s
what he offered
we&#39;ll just zero all your credit cards
out every month I said well that&#39;s very
nice of you Jim to offer that but then
you would own me wouldn&#39;t you because
you&#39;d have a record and I said I&#39;m
afraid I can&#39;t diseases no no we&#39;re just
trying to help you out you see how this
works that was in 1994 ninety three and
then 94 so they you know I you know over
the years had multiple of these sort of
approaches which is quite bizarre and
it&#39;s you couldn&#39;t make this stuff up if
you put it in a movie people think it
was fictitious but it is how they
operate so the corporate contracting end
is really a lot of where the action is
with these large corporations and their
compartmented groups and then within
certain agencies there are select folks
who are on this committee so it&#39;s not
all one thing but they do have meetings
and you know it&#39;s evolved over the years
my understanding I was told this some
years ago that about 70% of that group
favors when I&#39;m proposing but the other
30% who or have or the really violent
ones are opposed and they don&#39;t mind
killing one of their own like Bill Colby
bill Colby was in this group he defected
but he did it alone and he was going to
make a run at the crown jewel of what
they were keeping secret and that&#39;s the
energy technologies and that as I
mentioned that week they found him
floating down the Potomac River so and I
think that was in 95 or 96 but you know
I think this is why you know I&#39;ve had
some very tragic thing
happen in my life if you read between
the lines and that&#39;s why I decided I had
to find other ways of doing this where
we don&#39;t increase this body count how do
how they decide you&#39;re the right person
from being content and if that happened
and they contact you after that what to
do she&#39;s asking how the ETS choose not
me but you a person in general to make
contact I think that it&#39;s they&#39;re saying
that&#39;s been I think inappropriately
translated many are called but few are
chosen
I think it really is supposed to say
many are called but few answer choose to
answer the call and so I think that
there have been knocking on our front
door and our back door in our side door
for a very long time these civilizations
what they&#39;re waiting for are people who
will approach them without fear and
Prejudice without violence who
understand a little bit of their reality
who will educate themselves a little bit
about what it means to be interstellar
and to be interstellar means to be in a
extraordinarily high state of
consciousness personally but also your
technologies are interfacing with the
consciousness and so that&#39;s why you know
the if you approach it with an ethical
and moral intent of a pure heart
peaceful purpose no fear no prejudice
but also have prepared yourself for
shall we say the unusual even strange or
bizarre ways that they may interface
with you
so you&#39;re not afraid when they do then
they will but they expect a certain
level of you being educated and prepared
and that&#39;s and then they will and I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s you know i I&#39;ve always
said I don&#39;t think I&#39;m special I don&#39;t
think anyone is disabled from being able
to make contact I think it&#39;s there them
willing to go through the process of
training and education but more
importantly what is the purity
your heart and intent you know it can&#39;t
just because you want to see a UFO and
be entertained like dolphins at SeaWorld
it has to be for sincere purpose to to
be a liaison between humanity and theirs
their culture and if there&#39;s that purity
of intent then I think you&#39;ll be
astonished but there&#39;s also the
preparation that has to happen the
reason for that is if you read the last
book that we put out about
extraterrestrial the countdown to
transformation
extraterrestrial contact countdown the
transformation and you read the accounts
our senior team has had going around the
world some of it&#39;s very strange stuff
like we have a team up in New York where
there are these two wonderful ladies and
Diane and her wife Marilyn when they
first read my book hidden truth
forbidden knowledge had their cellphone
access when will I forget which one was
at the dentist office and all of a
sudden this sphere appeared on her phone
and the C SETI tones those tones we use
started playing over the speaker system
of the entire dentist office and over
her phone and it and this happened
multiple times until she came to the
Outer Banks of North Carolina and got
trained and just had amazing contact but
it was very strange stuff and in fact
the dentist came out and said what&#39;s
that weird music and it sound like it
sounds like something from outer space
and it was all coming through I think it
was Marilyn&#39;s phone I&#39;m not sure or
Diane&#39;s it was Diane yeah so there&#39;s all
kinds of ways where they will sort of
initiate you and test you to see if
you&#39;re ready for most people live in a
very 3d almost Telia logic the copy of
very in a box world but if you&#39;re
interstellar you&#39;re not living in that
world you&#39;re living in the world of
higher dimensions higher consciousness
energy fields that are completely beyond
the speed of light
and so when those come into 3d it can be
very unusual and so preparing yourself
for contact involves understanding where
mind and consciousness and thought and
electromagnetic systems and all this
phenomenon come together there&#39;s a nexus
where they come together and that&#39;s why
the development of higher states of
consciousness in the meditative state is
the foundation of the whole close
encounters of the fifth kind initiative
it&#39;s very controversial amongst the nuts
and bolts crowd in the UFO subculture I
said yes but you&#39;re not dealing with
civilizations using a piece of junk like
this they&#39;re not communicating using the
speed of light because if they&#39;re from
the andromeda galaxy which one of the
ETS that came at Joshua Tree told us he
was from the Andromeda galaxy and we
have a photo of us on our website go
look at it
this is two and a half million
light-years from Earth at the speed of
light it would take five million years
to get a signal from there to here and
back five million years Homo sapiens
haven&#39;t been on earth for five million
years so now that means that they&#39;re
using technologies that are
transdimensional going beyond the speed
of light and which also it so happens
interface with thought thought-forms
energy fields that are in the realm of
the thought what used to be relegated to
the Mystics but now is something we have
to accept as the real science of the
future and so this is why this is where
the science of consciousness and the
science of transdimensional and in
Tercero technologies are going to have
to come together which is actually my
first great love this is actually why it
got me involved in all this
because before I was a medical doctor I
you know I&#39;d had a near-death experience
and I had this even though I was raised
an atheist I had this experience of the
unbounded being and it was beautiful it
was a God consciousness experience for
lack of a better word and I realized
that the mind the consciousness within
every single person
is infinite and everything is folded
within it so I began to learn meditation
and became a meditation teacher I was a
meditation teacher before I was an
emergency doctor and what I learned was
that this became key and that&#39;s why
right after six months after that
near-death experience I had this amazing
contact experience that I recount and
hidden truth forbidden knowledge but I
think that it makes total sense and it&#39;s
the sort of thing nobody really wants to
talk about in polite circles
scientifically because it sounds too
weird but if it&#39;s not a little weird
it&#39;s not extraterrestrial it&#39;s probably
something from Lockheed and so educating
yourself about the nature of where
consciousness and thought and these
technologies interface with their
technologies and in 1991 I wrote a paper
that&#39;s in the first book I wrote that&#39;s
called the comprehensive assessment of
the UFO ETI extraterrestrial
intelligence subject and in it I talked
about technology assisted consciousness
and consciousness assisted technologies
where the mind interfaces with these
both ways where the mind can interface
with technology but also where
technologies can augment and project
thought and awareness more accurately
and that that&#39;s what these civilizations
had I got a call from a senior aerospace
engineer at McDonnell Douglas aerospace
that became part of Boeing phantom works
they had their own phantom works being
part of Boeing covert programs but it
was still McDonnell Douglas back then
and he said how do you know this this is
the most accurate assessment any of us
have ever read and it turns out he had
been all kinds all kinds of committees
had known old man MacDonald at McDonnell
Douglas and was on the Condon committee
to look into this at the University of
Colorado in 1969 but he said that this
is he says it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna get you in a
lot of trouble because it sounds a
little far out there then he related me
a story he says I was researching a case
for McDonnell Douglas years ago and it
was in the Baja California and
Mexico and a craft had materialized and
this et just appeared outside of it and
he had sort of a little like a little
black box rectangular box here at his
solar plexus and the person who had the
encounter said that as clear as you
would hear words in your ears there this
beam was communicating with his mind and
he was thinking back and he knows that
this device was receiving it and
augmenting it and facilitating and it
was going back and forth all through
thought and he said that was a very very
solid case he interviewed the people
directly and I said well that doesn&#39;t
surprise me
I said how else are you going to
communicate interstellar you have to go
at the speed of thought not the speed of
electromagnetic signals now this of
course opens you up into the you know
ridicule of the tinfoil hat crowd but
there is a serious science and by the
way it is why the people at the science
director at the CIA and other places
know that we&#39;re on to the real thing
I had an NSA guy come up to me and said
you know they&#39;re very mad at you because
you&#39;ve figured out the rosetta stone of
contact and involves consciousness and
thought transdimensional physics but it
is also the thing that gets you in the
most trouble the most quickly in the
conventional world mainly because the
conventional world has been miss
educated about science technology
consciousness religion thought
everything I mean it&#39;s all you know it&#39;s
almost like everything you know is wrong
but we&#39;re partially wrong but that&#39;s
where you get the preparation is really
in developing your state of
consciousness and having this intent and
then you just go out there and put
yourself at service and if you say I&#39;ll
be at service to doing this almost
anything is possible
you
