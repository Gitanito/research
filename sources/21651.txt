PREFACE
B e in g Scotch, Welsh, and Puritan, I am inclined to
reticence. But one comes to realize in writing a book
of this nature that reticence may become a hindering
form of selfism, for it is based on the assumption that
one’s own experiences have been given only for one’s
own benefit. Were this the case, one would scarcely have
the right to publish an autobiography.
I have sought, therefore, in making a choice, to
select not what my own predilections dictated, but
the recital of such events in my life as I hoped would
benefit and uplift the reader. This, then, has been the
criterion used, for it was borne in upon me that I was
called on to share these experiences, even when I
shrank from doing so, because they have been vouch­
safed for the sake of others, striving in the same
direction, quite as much as they were for my own
enlightenment or solace.

MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
LA U REN CE OLIPHANT
T he sun was setting on a cloudless July day, and escaping from
the heated house I made my way to a hammock swung between
two great trees. Weary from a day of hard literary work, I dropped
into it and stretched my tired limbs, thankfully lifting my face
to let the cool evening breeze play through my hair. When I had
settled myself comfortably and was swinging, lazily, a sudden
vision swept before my eyes. The pretty garden, with its white
and red roses clambering everywhere, seemed to fade from me,
as a scene is changed on a darkened stage; and, instead, a new
vista appeared. A strange land, inhabited by people as strange,
floated before my inner senses, and I realized, through some
subtle impression on my brain, that my life was to be completely
transformed.
For many long days I had been engaged in a rather monotonous
routine of work, and had been so absorbed in the Philosophy
I was seeking to write, on which I had been engaged many
years, that I had almost forgotten the world still moved outside
the garden walls, which had shut me in as completely as though
I were a nun. I had seen no one except the two friends with whom
I lived, and I had gone nowhere.
When one of my companions, Dorcas, joined me a few moments
later, I said nothing of my vision; but during the evening and
late into the night the feeling persisted that there would be, very
soon, a complete volte-face in my life.
The next morning I awoke with the word “ Prepare” on my
lips, and after Dorcas’s husband had left the breakfast-table I
said to her: “ Dorcas, can you drive me to town in the pony-cart
this morning, for I wish to buy a travelling outfit?”
“ Where are you going?” she asked in astonishment.
“ I have not the slightest idea,” I answered, “ but I must buy
an outfit, and” —the words almost seemed to speak themselves—
“ I must get some nice underclothing.”
“ It sounds very much as though you were preparing a trous-
14 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
seau,” she said, with her merry laugh, “ but, so far as I know, no
lover has appeared on the scene recently.”
“ No,” I said, “ not yet. But I must get ready to go somewhere.”
“ I don’t know whether it is safe to drive about with a woman
who is evidently out of her mind,” she laughed, as she rang to
give the order for the carriage, “ but, in any event, you are
uncommonly shabby, certainly, and without doubt you need some
new clothes.”
We journeyed to the neighbouring town, made our purchases,
and returned with our little carriage filled to overflowing.
A day or two later I received a letter from Laurence Oliphant,
my future husband, followed by a copy of his recently published
Scientific Religion. He wrote from New York, and asked if he
might come to Southern Indiana, where I was then living, and
call upon me.
I handed the communication to Dorcas, who said: “ Extra­
ordinary letter; why does this noted Englishman want to travel
two days and a night by rail to come and call on a woman hidden
away in this little corner of Indiana, a woman he has never
seen?”
I spent a busy period preparing my clothes, and at the end of
it Laurence appeared in our drawing-room.
I had lived so much out of the world, working on the book
which I began in 1882 and which is not yet finished, that I was
inclined to be timid when I met a stranger, but I felt completely
at home with Mr. Oliphant from the moment he took my hand
in his.
As the afternoon wore away we went on the veranda, shaded
by its clambering roses, and, after a few words, fell into that
long, full silence which only unites those who know each other
intimately. Presently, as we sat side by side, he turned to me with
an almost boyish simplicity of manner, although he was a grey­
haired man, and said to me: “ Are you happy, resting here?”
“ Yes, I am—very happy,” I answered.
He then drew from his pocket a picture of Alice, his late wife,
and handed it to me.
“ A beautiful face,” I said, and as I looked I felt that she also
was of my kindred, both she and Laurence' seeming nearer to
me than friends I had known for years.
We sat through the quiet, moonlight evening, saying little to
each other; but, as he rose to bid me good-night, I saw reflected
LA U REN CE OLIPHANT i 5
in his face, which had looked ill and weary when first he came,
the deep peace that filled my own being.
Early the next morning he called again, and his first words
were:
“ I am going to Palestine with a party of friends; will you
join us?”
“ When?” I said.
i , “ In ten days; can you get ready?”
“ Will you give me twenty-four hours in which to pray for
guidance?” I asked
“ Yes, certainly. But I trust you will come,” he said, with a
strange break in his voice, as though he were a man in need
of help.
We spent the day together, talking of many things, and I
realized that we could spend years together, and never come to
the end of our mutual interests. To him, the man of the world,
this was not surprising, perhaps; but to me, who was so often
shyly dumb in the presence of others, it was a new experience,
and a very astonishing one, seeing that our two lives had been
spent in such totally different environments.
On leaving, he asked me somewhat anxiously whether I had
read his Philosophy, Scientific 'Religion, and whether my own book
contradicted it in any wise.1
I said to him that I had read it through once, and intended
to study it more carefully when I had the leisure; but I thought
that the two books agreed so far as essentials were concerned,
where they touched on similar points, but in the main the ground
traversed was not at all the same.
The day after his departure I left my dear friends, Dorcas and
her husband, in whose house I had spent a quiet year of work,
and returned to the home of my brother, Julian Dale Owen, in
New Harmony, the village where my grandfather, Robert Owen,
had tried his social experiment. During the short journey between
the two towns, I sought to arrange my rather bewildered ideas,
in order to give some sort of coherent account to my family;
but I was afraid I did not succeed, for when I walked, tin-
announced, into the dining-room, where my brother, his wife,
and children sat at the evening meal, I could only say in answer
to the startled and joyous shout:
1 The Mediators, preceded by a small book on the same lines, called Duality:
Male andFemale createdHe them.
x6 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
“ Aunt Rosamond, where did you spring from?”
“ Good evening, I am on my way to Jerusalem.”
The news that “Miss Rose,” as I was called in the village, was
en route to Palestine spread rapidly through the little town, and
our spacious veranda was soon filled to overflowing with eagerly
questioning visitors. When I retired, at a late hour, I found a
miserable, sobbing girl in my bed. My niece, Grace, who had
been under my care since her babyhood, was crying her heart
out at the thought of our separation. But as I took her in my
arms I said to her:
“Don’t cry, honey” (our familiar term of endearment, borrowed
from the negroes), “ for I feel sure that you will join me in the
Holy Land. We shall not be separated long, dearest child.” She
fell asleep, presently, in my arms, but it was long before her
sobbing breath grew quiet.
The next two or three days were very busy ones, as I had to
leave everything in order for a long absence, and to bid good-bye
to all my friends. 1
The platform at the station was crowded on the morning of
my departure to give me a warm God-speed, a warmth which we
Westerners miss in other more reserved lands; and as the train
sped out of the station I could scarcely see, through my blinding
tears the flowers and fruit showered upon me by my relatives
and friends. Yet, though I was leaving my beloved home, I felt,
m some mysterious way, that in truth I was going to join my
own nearest of kin, stranger though he was to me.
On reaching New York I went to the house of a relative,

no matter what position he took; I noted, it seemed to me for
the first time, so hurried had the short days been—I noted the
remarkable outline of his dome-like head, the deep eyes and
strong features; I observed, with some concern, the strange, grey
pallor of his skin, and, above all, I was struck by the unfamiliar
intonations of his English speech, as he turned to address me. It
seemed to me I had known the inner man for centuries, and so
absorbed had I been in the spiritual bond between us, it came
upon me, almost as a shock, that the outer man, whom I had not
observed with close attention until now, was a stranger to me.
What had induced me, with my shy reserve, my Scotch clannish­
ness, to embark on this venture, accompanied only by unknown
companions, who were carrying me away from all my own people
to a strange new land?
Again, he turned to me with the same expression he had worn
on Dorcas’s veranda, and with a deeply contented voice said:
“ Child, do not be home-sick; it is right, quite right, that you
should come with me,” and taking my hand in his with the sort
of masterful homage which best comforts a frightened woman,
he kissed it reverently. With the touch my fears vanished, and
a blessed balm poured through my trembling, overwrought
frame.
Two days later Laurence asked me to be his wife, and told me
the story of his coming to America.
“ I was in Paris with Murray— my dear young friend—when he
received a letter from you, Rosamond. He said you and he had
been writing to each other for several years, and that he trusted
your judgment about spiritual things as he trusted the insight of
no other human being. He gave me the letter to read and I said
as I folded it: ‘Murray, I must see the woman who wrote that
letter.’ ‘It is impossible,’ he replied, ‘she is in Southern Indiana,
U.S.A., and we are in Paris.’
“ ‘It does not matter where she is,’ I said, ‘I am going to find
her.’ I started for America without loss of time, wrote to you,
sent you Scientific Religion, and as soon as possible reached you
in person. At first the idea of marriage was not in my mind, but
after I had seen you in Southern Indiana I knew that I had found
the helpmate that I needed. There is only one objection to making
you my wife, so far as I can see,” he said, with his characteristic
laugh, which revealed depths of emotion not often sounded by
the most solemn utterances of other men, “ only one reason why
B
18 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
I should not marry you, and that is that I want to marry you so
very much. Were God to tell me to give you up, child, I should
have a great struggle to obey Him. Somehow, in these few short
days, you have twined yourself into my life, and I need your help,
I do so need your help,” he said, with a catch in his voice which
went to my heart.
He was now standing before me, and as I looked up at the tall
form I noticed afresh the grey pallor of his face and a look of
great weariness in his pose, graceful as it was.
“ Dear friend,” I said, “ I am bewildered, for I am a slow sort
of person, and these sudden changes do not suit me. Will you
give me time to pray, so that I may be illumined?”
“ Yes, but you will not take too long to make up your mind,
will you? for I fear my fifty-nine years of life have not yet taught
me the art of waiting patiently. By the way, how old are you?”
“ I am forty-two,” I said.
“ Well, we ought to be old enough to know our own minds
when we do make them up,” he said gaily, and then with the
sudden change of tone which was one of his charms, he added,
again with the strangely pathetic inflection in his voice, “ You
will not keep me in suspense very long, my child?”
“ No, I will pray with all my strength to know the Will of
God, and will tell you what comes to me as soon as I can clearly
hear His answer.”
I spent the whole night in prayer, and the next morning, when
I stepped out of my cabin, I met Laurence waiting in the passage
outside. His eagerly expectant eyes searched mine, and he said:
“ Well, what is the answer?”
“ Can we find a quiet, private place on deck?” I asked.
Yes, it is early, and there are only a few people about.”
He found a sheltered nook, wrapped my rugs about me, and
then stood impatiently before me.
Well, ’ he repeated, “ what is the answer?”
Then, as I looked up at him, amused at his impetuous haste,
we both burst into hearty laughter.
You are right,” he said, “ after living fifty-nine and forty-two
years respectively, it is possible to wait a few moments longer,
is it not? I don t know why I feel such a sense of haste, of anxiety
I scarcely know what to call it—as though something might
come between us. But you will tell me quickly, will you not,
what decision you have reached?”
LAU REN CE OLIPHANT i 9
“ The answer to my prayer seems to be very clear,” I said
“ and it is this:
“ I believe that Alice, your dear Alice, is your mate. She will
be yours, I trust, to all eternity, and I can in no wise fill her
place, and shall not ask to do so. I can love her with you, and
I feel that even in heaven my love will be acceptable. So when­
ever it is my privilege to serve you, you may know that her hand
is clasped in mine. Thus helped, I believe that I can be of use
to you, and I am willing to take your name.”
“ Do you believe that you are capable of maintaining such an
attitude?” said Laurence.
“ I hope so—I believe so—with God’s help.”
“ Then, may He bless you always, my dearest friend.”
He took my face in his hands and kissed me on the forehead.
It could scarcely be called a lover’s kiss, and yet its sweetness
filled my being with so great a delight that I did not envy the
most passionately loved young bride whose lover had failed to
remember God when he embraced her.
We did not know, at that happy moment, how soon our trials
were to begin; but I may say here that throughout the difficult
months which followed I felt that Alice, his beloved first wife,
stood by me, and I could scarcely have borne the ordeal had not
God, in His goodness, permitted me to feel her tender help and
sympathy.
After breakfast, on our way upstairs, Laurence drew me into
the open door of Rosa’s cabin. She was lying, dressed, in her
berth, but was afraid to venture on deck, fearing seasickness.
He pulled me down beside him on the couch opposite her
berth.
“ Rosa,” he said, “ I am going to be married.” He glanced at
her with a shy, whimsical look— “ and here she is,” he added,
putting my hand in Rosa’s.
Why not, Mr. Oliphant?” said Rosa. “ I think we have all
guessed it, from the time Miss Dale Owen reached New York.
May I say this : It is true that you are no longer a young man, but
I think any woman you chose to honour with your affection
could love you. I envy you,” she said, turning to me with a pretty
gesture, and folding our hands together she kissed them both.
She was a dear girl, and we were thankful to have her blessing
on our union.
In all the dreams of my youth I had never pictured a wooing
20 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
quite like ours. It was so matter of fact, and yet so blessedly
satisfying, filling my soul with contentment. I felt that we were
comrades, yoke-fellows in labour, rather than sweethearts, and
yet the twelve days of our voyage remain with me as days of
pure delight. The weariness seemed to disappear from Laurence’s
face, the strange, pinched pallor was no longer noticeable, the
fresh winds giving him a flush of colour. His brilliant wit, which
seemed to have been under some sort of restraint, escaped from
bondage, and our fellow-passengers sometimes turned in wonder
to hear such peals of laughter from so grey-haired a couple. In
short, Laurence was at his best, and at his best he was the most
entertaining companion I had ever known.
When trouble overtook us later, I felt that God had been very
good to give us this short period of care-free joy. Our years
seemed to drop from us, and we were like a happy boy and girl.
In all my youth, when I took fife very seriously, I had never
imagined so much pure fun could be compressed into two short
weeks.
One evening as we sat on the deck, loth to move, although
most of the passengers had gone below, I said to Laurence :
“ Dear friend, I scarcely understand the transformation you
have wrought in me. I warn you that I am Scotch, Welsh, and
Puritan, and have inherited, therefore, a threefold stiff-neckedness.
They tell me I greatly resemble Robert Owen, my grandfather,
and his father-in-law sometimes said to him, after a discussion:
Robert, thou need’st be very right, for thou art very obstinate.’
I am afraid I have inherited his characteristic. It is certain that
I have the faults of these three strains of blood.”
Perhaps, said Laurence, “ but it seems to me you have also
inherited the virtues. Yet I see that your seriousness is so profound
as to hinder, sometimes, your usefulness. You have not enough
elasticity to minimize the bad effects of a shock.”
“ It is true,” I said, wondering a little at the fact that he seemed
to know me better than I knew myself. “ I am also unwise enough
to seek to carry the whole world-burden in my own strength.
I used to cry myself to sleep, night after night, when I was a girl,
because I could not cleanse the world of sin and folly, at once
and for ever.
Precisely,” said Laurence, “ I can quite believe it; and while
you are vainly trying to assume the Saviour’s place, you have
forgotten one of the important duties of woman.” He lifted my
LA U REN CE OLIPHANT 2]
face to his with a gesture half-tender, half-teasing, and laughinglj
added: “ Like many wise philosophers, who supply the ballast oi
the world to keep the rest of us level-keeled, you have forgotter
that it is the mission of a woman to be beautiful. Alice was mud
better looking than you are, Rosamond.”
“ I know it,” I said wistfully, “ and I have feared that you might
be disappointed.”
His deeply tender eyes looked into mine. “ Do not be troubled,
dearest friend. You are not beautiful, it is true, but you have
enough good looks to satisfy me. You have a noble head,
Rosamond, and eyes so true and steadfast, that no man could
doubt you once he has looked into their depths. You are a rest
to my soul, and I thank God for you, His good gift to me in my
hour of need.” He took my hand in his, and we sat for many
minutes in that motionless silence which is so full, so satisfying,
that it seems to lift years of weariness from the burdened spirit.
“ We cannot sit here all night, I suppose,” said Laurence, at
last, although I should like to do so, and before we go below
there is a subject upon which I should like to consult you, a
subject which troubles me.”
He stretched his graceful length in the steamer chair, and
clasping his hands above his head, he looked up at the stars as
though he were marshalling the ideas, or facts, he wished to
consult me about. He seemed to be strenuously absorbed, but
presently his being was relaxed as though inviting some gracious
presence to enter and illumine him. As I looked at him I was
startled by a swift pang of jealousy. Was he calling upon Alice
to help him, had he forgotten my presence? I realized, then, how
the contact with his magnetic personality had filled my starved
little being with a new, rich life. The virility of the man was
revealed to me. Graceful as was his pose, pale as were his features,
in the moonlight; finely tapered as were the hands, interlaced
above his brow; soft and waving as was his long silken beard—
yet one knew that beneath the grace of the man of the world
there was a character strong as steel. For a moment, then, my
heart was tempted to cry out: “ Give me the right of possession,
do not ask me to serve as the handmaiden of another woman,
dead and out of sight. I have been half-starved, always, and now,
at last, I have found one who can fill my life. O God, give
him to me.”
But happily the storm, although violent, was short. I knew that
22 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
in reply to the deepest prayer I had been able to offer, lasting
during the whole night, the answer had come: “ He belongs to
Alice” ; and God has been good enough to endow me with a
certain amount of common sense. When a truth is patent to me,
I am able to see, clearly and at once, that it is a great waste of
time to regret the inevitable. If, in answer to the most earnest and
oft-repeated prayer I knew how to utter, God had permitted me
to be deceived, then there was no God. Hence, I believed, fully
and firmly believed, that Laurence and his beloved Alice were
mates, now and for ever. I therefore said to myself: “ You know
that he belongs to Alice, do not, then, break your foolish heart
over a fact which, from the beginning, you have fully accepted.”
By dint of stamping this verity, about which I had no shadow of
doubt, again and again on my revolting consciousness, I was able,
when Laurence began to speak, to turn to him with a mind so
far serenely balanced that I could listen to what he had to say
with a quiet, a disengaged attention.
He looked at me, for a moment, with his quick divination.
“ Yes, I knew the struggle would come to one or possibly both
of us,” he said. “ We fit each other so harmoniously, it is such a
delight to be together, is it not, Rosamond; and yet I am con­
vinced, even as you are, that we are not mates, not opposite­
answering complements, but similars, in spite of the fact that we
are so unlike in some things. It is a subtle, difficult subject to
analyse; for instance, although we have been so short a time
together, the accord between us seems smoother than it did, at
times, between Alice and myself; yet we are both aware, I think,
that it is thus accordant not because we are more closely allied,
but because we sing together in a simple unison, as brother and
sister, whereas Alice and I were attuned in a more difficult,
because more complex, and hence, in a richer harmony.”
However, he added, with one of his sudden transitions,
do not let us waste our time by discussing a question the prac­
tical side of which is settled, for I warn you,” he said with a
master gesture, I warn you that we are going to be married
as soon as we land, or at least as soon as the law permits after

which is in an absolute muddle, for I do not seem to be able to
decide whether I have done right or wrong. May I enter into
some rather intimate and personal matters, dear child? You will

I said. ’
“ Well, then,” he continued, taking out his watch, “ I must put
the matter to you concisely, for it is getting very late, the decks
seem to be deserted.
“ As a man of the world, and knowing the habits of my com­
rades, I became convinced that sex sins are the most dangerous
sins on earth, and carrywith them theworst possible consequences.
The first realization I had of this fact came to me when my wise
father took me to see a certain collection which is, or which was,
in Paris. I do not know whether it is still in existence. The horrible
diseases incurred through sex licence were here represented in
lifelike, coloured papier-mache figures, and all the sermons in
the world could not have impressed me as did the sight of these
creatures eaten by loathsome diseases. I deeply regret that the
lesson did not bear the fruits it ought to have done in my youth;
nevertheless, it made a strong impression on me, and had a
restraining influence. I have felt it my duty, therefore, to do what
lay in my power to cleanse this filthy sewer which pollutes the
whole world with its stench.
So far as my own life is concerned, the way seemed to lie
straight before me. My Maker made it quite clear to me, at last,
in answer to a deep supplication for guidance, that in order to
be a man one must be in control of one’s own organism; for if
one is not the master of powerful passions, one is bound to be
their slave. One must compel them or be compelled by them.
Hence, I learnt self-control by sleeping with my beloved and
beautiful Alice in my arms for twelve years without claiming
the rights of a husband. We lived as a sister and brother. I am
a passionate lover, and so it was difficult, very difficult,” he said,
unconsciously clenching both hands as he remembered his
struggle> “ but it did not prove to be impossible. I was able to
keep my vow, and I shall never regret having made it.
Presently, when my health failed for a short time, my physician
ascribed my breakdown to my continence.
I do not believe you,’ I said to him, ‘but even were it true,
is it not high time for men to be willing to suffer a little in order
to prove that passion can be bridled, when thousands upon thou­
sands of helpless women have been broken down, and have even
died, because passion is so often unbridled? I have known cases
in my own circle of acquaintances where men have been told by
MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
their physicians that it was dangerous for their wives to have
more children. Yet the children have been born, and the mothers
have died. Are not such husbands murderers? Is it not necessary,
then, to cry a halt, in order to determine the place which men
occupy? Are they bound to be slaves, governed by their own
physical desires, and hence brutelike; or may they aspire to have
dominion over themselves, and hence over the earth?”
I clasped his clenched hands in mine, and, loosening his fingers,
kissed them fervently.
“ I understand, now, why we have been able to create around
us a world of innocence in which, in spite of our grey hairs, we
have lived like two blessed children, care-free and sin-free. Oh,
Laurence, the pure delight you have given me ought to repay
you a little for the sacrifice you have made. You have seemed so
different from other men.”
The tears stood in his eyes as he turned to m e: “ Is it true, my
friend, that I have been able to create, at last, a new man in myself?
If that is so, then I thank Him, and I repeat, with a double
conviction, I believe that I was led aright.”
“ But now comes the puzzling question I wish to place before
you. I am a very impatient man,” he said ruefully. “ I am always
tempted to pluck up seedling flowers by the roots to be sure that
they are growing. So I have tried to push the world on a little
faster by placing two or three young couples, who were not
married, in a tempting proximity in order to teach them the habit
of self-control. Do you think that this was a wise course to take?
I, like Murray, have come to trust your judgment as I trust the
wisdom of no other mortal creature; so tell me, dear one, do you
think I was right or wrong?”
I sat for some time in prayerful thought before answering him.
Well,” said Laurence, presently, turning in his seat with
resdess eagerness, “ are you condemning me, my little Puritan?”
No, absolutely no. It is clear to me that if you have been
misled, as I believe you have been, then the mistake you have
ma e ls,to y°ur credit, in this sense: Having had the strength of
will to become complete master of yourself, you have believed
that other more ordinary men would do likewise. So I do not
condemn you, but I honour you, even though it seems to me
^ ° « v Ve mac*e a m^
sta^;e>and for this reason:
. HnTnt 7 Uli n0t fee11 warranted in Pitting strong drink before
drunkard, when you knew he was unable to resist it. You would
LAU REN CE OLIPHANT 2J
not place a beautiful fallen woman in the path of a loose, a will­
less sensualist. You would not leave unguarded gold where an
unrepentant thief would be sure to find it. In short, you would
believe it to be wrong to tempt any mortal beyond his strength.
Ifj then, you create temptations, artificial in the sense that you
yourself have invented them, this act presupposes that you know
precisely the strength of those whom you place in this artificially
created environment, and hence you are sure that the allurement
is not too strong, that the temptation is not greater than they can
bear. As only our God can search the human soul to its depth, it
seems to me that you have been wrongfully seeking to assume His
prerogative,” I said.
“ Is it not true that He, only, can tell what a man is able to bear,
to resist, and hence He only is able subtly to adjust our environ­
ment to our needs, permitting circumstances which will help us,
if we do our best, and forbidding circumstances, which inevitably
will lead us to destruction. If He does not thus fit the environ­
ment to the requirements of the organism, He is not our God
but a bungler, less able to take care of His children than a wise
and careful earthly parent, who sees to it that his child is sur­
rounded by the most salutary influences he, the parent, can
command.
“ So, dear Laurence, I think you ought to leave the work of
God in the hands of God, and not seek to create artificial tempta­
tions when you cannot measure, with any certainty, the resisting
powers of the tempted ones.”
“ I think you are right,” he said, “ and it is an immense relief
to me to believe that you are. A weight has dropped from my
shoulders. Yes, I see that we must let God manage His own
children in His own way. As usual, it is conceit which has misled
me; I thought I could improve on God’s methods and hurry
His work.”
After a pause, he added, rather anxiously, “ But take my own
life; do you think I was wrong there ?”
“ It does not seem to me that you were,” I said. “ The case is
altogether different. You did not artificially create a temptation,
it was the natural consequence of your marriage. Your relation
was legitimate, you were not thrown together in a compromising
manner, as was the case with the young couples whose self-
control you wished to test and train. The decision did not lie
between avoiding the temptation or creating it, in order to resist
26 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
it; for, being a married man, the temptation was there, self-created.
Hence your choice lay between an indulgence the world calls
legitimate, and an asceticism which, in answer to prayer, you
believed God asked of you. You were deciding, in short, with
regard to your own actions, God-directed, so you believed, and
you were not seeking to judge for others. It is certain the Bible
leads us to accept that self-control in marriage, for a given time,
and for a sensible, legitimate purpose, is right, for Saint Joseph
teaches us this lesson; and to sum up, the last and best test of a
given experiment is the fruit which it bears, is it not true?” I
knelt down at his side for a moment, on the deserted deck, and
looking up at him reverently, I added: “ I, your affianced wife,
can testify that in your case the fruit is very good. I have never
met another man quite like you, although I have been surrounded
by distinguished men always, and several lovers have wished to
marry me. I do not know what sort of life you may have led in
your youth, nor what errors you may have made since, but now
your long years of self-control have so purified you that a woman
can trust you, absolutely.”
He raised me and folded me in his arms, saying with simple
earnestness: “ Rosamond, I thank you.” Then he added, “ The
only regret I have is this: It seemed to me at the end of eight or
nine years that I had learnt my lesson, and I wanted very much
to have a child; the passion of the parent woke in me. But Alice
objected, and, as she had to bear the pains and penalties of mater­
nity, it seemed to me it was she who had the right to decide. So
I yielded.”
There was something in his wistful face that brought the hot
tears to my eyes. It was the look of the martyr willing to be
crucified, if, through the crucifying, self and its progeny of
personal desires could be killed also.
This subject was never discussed between us again, and hence
I was amazed when, later, a wholly unexpected storm burst over
my head, which I will describe presently.
It is difficult to define “ Laurence Oliphant’s charm,” for its
very elusiveness constituted a part of it. He was so gay, when he
should have been serious, as to seem almost frivolous; and so
serious where most men are gay, as to seem unbalanced. The
joy of hvrng, happfiy, filled him, often, when the moment before
he had looked prematurely aged, lined, suffering. One could not
LA U REN CE OLIPHANT 2y
analyse him, for while one sought to do so he had changed to
a new creature; and yet the steadfast eyes and strong features
spoke of a fidelity and a purpose which were unchanging. He
was endlessly varied, and yet one knew that his love, once given,
would remain faithfully constant always. Above all, he had not
one vestige of that monotonous goodness which seems to turn
goodness almost into a vice. His speech was racy, his descriptions
subtle, his intuitions marvellously quick; and yet in some matters
he was as easily deceived as a child; believing, where others
doubted; accepting, in spite of his keen powers of analysis, what
others rejected. One seemed, then, to be in the company of
twenty different men, and under these circumstances life could
never seem dull.
This strangely interesting character, worldly wise by dint of
living in high places, among kings and princes, rested, at the
same time, on a foundation of touchingly simple meekness,
claiming nothing, and if necessary ready to sacrifice all things; so
that while one laughed at his brilliant wit, the wit of the polished
man of the world, one felt that the tears were close behind, ready
to be shed, because of his pathetic self-immolation.
His keenness was like a lance skilfully wielded in order, if need
be, to be willingly broken at last; a self-abnegation which set
him in sharp contrast to meaner men who fight to succeed at
all hazards.
If the reader can compound out of this mixture what is called
a character, and define the type to which it belongs, it is more
than I was able to do. There is only one thing certain, Laurence
Oliphant was able to draw one’s heart from out one’s breast,
the emotion being so intense as to seem almost like a pain,
because one pitied him as much as one revered him.
T. LA K E HARRIS
On the day following this conversation, Laurence chanced to
mention T. Lake Harris, and told me the history of his connec­
tion with this remarkable man, a connection about which so
much has been said and written.
“ He met me,” said Laurence, “ at a moment when I was at the
parting of the ways. I had come to realize that pride, vanity,
conceit, was the bane of man, his self-sufficiency standing as an
impenetrable wall between his God and himself. It is the chief
impediment which prevents us from seeing, face to face, the
glory of our Creator. Being filled with ourselves, we cannot be
filled by Him. There is no room for Him to enter. I knew, at the
same time, that pride was wound into the very fibres of my being.
Wherever I had turned success had followed me, so I had an
augmented share of the conceit which blinds all Anglo-Saxons.
English pride, flowing as a broad and silent river, is only equalled
by American vanity rushing along like a noisily hurrying stream,”
he said, nodding at me emphatically.
“I do not deny it,” I answered, smiling back at him.
Well, then, the question remained, how was I to get rid of
my foolish conceit influencing every breath I drew? This question
was paramount in my mind when I met T. Lake Harris. It turned
out that he was better able to bully me than any man I had ever
met, and as I needed to be bullied, I remained with him until his
tyrannies had had the desired effect. At his bidding I worked for
ourteen years in the fields, acted as stable-boy, sold strawberries
at the railway stations, etc., and at intervals I returned to
the world, filled lucrative positions, and sent the considerable
sums o money I had gained to Harris. In short, I was willingly
shorn of all the prerogatives my station in life had conferred
upon me.
In the beginning, I believed Harris to be a great and a good
man, and I still think he might have filled a lofty place had he
nrinninhn S * he t0° k the wrong one, being blinded,
E “ S ’ through love of power and love of money. Finally,
knowlerf T*6 t0 j S
C
u aS ^ seemeb to me dishonourably, the
knowledge I gamed by occupying an inner place in a certain
29
T. L A K E HARRIS
business centre, in order to make a large sum of money, and was
angry when I refused. I had had doubts of him before’ this, but
from this time the scales fell completely from my eyes. Yet in
answer to the deepest supplication for guidance I knew how to
utter, I was still led to remain under his orders, although the
position had grown to be most irksome.
“ There were times when I felt I could no longer bear it. I
remember one evening I was driving home a load of potatoes
in a farm wagon. Suddenly I felt as though something in me
would break if I did not have some sort of outlet. I threw the
reins on the backs of the horses, a fine pair of well-bred animals,
and whipping them into a mad gallop, which they seemed to
enjoy as much as I did, we went down the road at a break-neck
pace, I shouting at the top of my lungs. I am told that prisoners
sometimes break out in this way and warn their keepers that the
fren2y is coming. I can sympathize with them, and I must say I
never enjoyed a better quarter of an hour than the one wherein
we spun blindly, dangerously, along the country road. The
neighbours, hearing the commotion, ran after us in an ever­
growing crowd, and when the affrighted company reached us,
my intelligent team had raced, unguided, into the stable yard
where they belonged, without grazing a gatepost, and I was
calmly feeding them.
“ The next morning, cheerfully taking up my yoke again, I
went back over the track and picked up the scattered potatoes,
searching until I thought I had found the last one.
“ Finally, after about fourteen years of service, I received from
Harris a peremptory and unreasonable command, while I was in
Europe filling one of the posts of which I have spoken. With
a wearied patience, I was preparing, as usual, to obey him, when
suddenly the words came to me, ‘It is finished.’ Chains, more
binding than any physical chains could be, dropped from me as
if by magic, and I instantly knew a freedom so unfettered that
I seemed as one born again. Only a man who had suffered my
bondage could know, by constrast, my splendid sense of liberty.
New powers awoke in me, fresh inspirations, an exhilarating
en«-gy. God was repaying me a hundredfold for all that I had
orfeited; with this great gain that the new man was a much
humbler creature than the old one had been.
Then followed a struggle. Harris had been under the impres­
sion that I obeyed him because he had mastered me. He did not
3o MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
understand that the bondage had been wholly self-imposed,
voluntary, that it had been suffered for a given end; namely, to
kill my pride. Therefore, when I went back to America to make
a settlement with him, he quite failed to grasp the fact that his
control over me was at an end.
“ On returning to his Colony, I found that abuses had crept in
of which I wholly disapproved; and hence I induced those who
had joined the Society because I belonged to it to leave it with me.
“ When Harris found that the ground was being cut from
under his feet, and that I condemend his unworthy acts, he made
desperate efforts to resist me. Among other things, he attempted
to get me into an insane asylum. Needless to say he failed; and,
in the end, Alice and myself left the Colony after obtaining a part,
although not the whole, of the money due to us.”
A LIC E
“ F in a lly we settled, Alice and I, in Haifa, Syria, at the foot of
Mount Carmel, m the home to which I am taking you dear one
and there we lived, unmolested, for three blessed yelrs Harris
had been as tyrannical to Alice as he had been to me and this
was the heaviest cross I had to carry— a cross which,’ at times
seemed intolerable. She was sent away from me to toil in the
humblest positions, positions which her patrician blood ill-fitted
her to fiH, and to think of my deficately nurtured, my sensitive
Afice exposed to these buffetings of fate, living on the meagre
pittance she was able, by hard work, to earn—this trial was
almost more than I could bear, although she herself endured it
meekly, patiently, willingly.
“ Stfil the Inner Voice, which to the Christian is louder than
any worldly-wise speech of surrounding counseUors— this Voice
bid us endure, and at last God Himself released us both.
“And He repaid us; a thousandfold did He repay us'; the joy
was short, it is true, for my beloved was taken after three years
but there are few people on this earth, I believe, to whom is given
so flawless a peace, so blessed a joy, as was vouchsafed to Alice
and myself in the Holy Land.
“ There she died in our house on Mount Carmel, built at the
edge of the Druse village, Dalieh, died of a malarial fever con­
tracted while we were camping near Tiberias. She was your age
when she was released, and for a few days my life was so unbear­
ably desolate that it seemed impossible for me to go on living
withour her. But God saw my need, and in His mercy permitted
me to feel her presence, pouring a blessed balm into my soul.
From that hour to this I have struggled on as best I could
during three hard-working years. Now,” he added solemnly’
nave met you, and in some strange way, which I do not attempt
to explain, Alice has seemed nearer to me from the moment you
took her picture in your hands on that first day. God has not only
given you to me, as a precious gift, but in and through you Alice
has seemed to be more intimately restored to me. I do not know
whether I am dreaming, whether some strange fancy possesses
me, or whether it is the truth. What do you think, Rosamond?”
2 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
“ I do not believe it to be an illusion, but the truth, a truth we
cannot understand, because, as yet, we have almost totally failed
to realize how great is the power of love. You love Alice and
myself, I love yourself and Alice, then should not this love unite
us instead of separating us? Is it the province of love to wrench
souls apart? I think not. You love me less than you love Alice—
I accept this, because I believe that, from the beginning, God
placed Alice nearest to you, and I wish to bow, without resistance,
to His Will. If we are united in and through Him, is it possible
for His divine bond also to separate us? Can love ever cleave a
chasm between any two lovers in a group of unselfish lovers,
instantly willing to yield any rights which He does not confer?”
“ But in some respects you are greater than Alice, a wiser,
stronger woman; then, is it right for you to feel that you are her
handmaiden?” said Laurence.
“ Set in my own true home, God would crown me as queen,
even as He crowns the humblest woman living. But, for the
moment, I am serving in Alice’s home, as many women are asked
to do in order to help their sisters; and this is an honourable
position, is it not true?”
“ Well,” said Laurence, giving me his arm, “ let us take a
walk; whatever else is true, it is certain that our cramped limbs
need stretching.”
The next day, when we were pacing the deck, he said abruptly:
“ If I am not your mate, he must be somewhere in this world,
and I am robbing him?”
“ He may not be in this world,” I said, “ but in heaven. At
any rate, God has not yet sent him, and He has sent you and has
made it clear to us that He has brought us together for some
wise purpose. You agree with me, Laurence, that it is not best
for minds with a mystical tendency to get into too much of a
labyrinth, but it is wiser, is it not, to keep to the narrow path
marked out by duty? We have prayed with ah our hearts to be
shown the step straight before us, and we both believe that He
leads us to be married. We know that, so far, we have greatly
helped each other, and we hope to be of still greater service, one
to another, and to our friends, in the future. So, dear, I may now
reflect to you, the new nature with which you have endowed me.
Let us walk gaily, hand in hand, missing no good and beautiful
thing on our way, obeying Him step by step, and being ever
A LICE
33
ready to separate in order the better to serve Him, even should
He order us to do so when we stand at the foot of the Altar
ready to be married. Thus flexibly obedient, we cannot make a
faise step-is it not true? for He is not a fiend who lies to His
children, when they earnestly desire to hear the truth and nothin?
but the truth. 6
Let us be like Saint Joseph, for whom I have the greatest
reverence, imitating him in a simple, faithful obedience only
asking to be shown, clearly, the next step and leaving the future
in God’s hands. Often it is not possible for our Maker to reveal
to us His whole plan, but He can and will illumine the way
immediately before us.” 3
¥ 7? n T .right> ™ helpmate.” He straightened himself
to his full height, as though he had thrown off a load, and drawing
my arm closer in his we walked up and down the deck our
happy souls seeming to skim the waves with the sea-gulls • to
sparkle on the waters with the sun-shafts; to race, untrammelled
with the free winds; and, above all, to laugh with the merry*
care-free children playing about the deck.
‘T “ ’’I f P eated>/‘you are right. We are duffers, idiots,
blind and deaf idiots; for believing in an omnipotent God we
are always afraid He will forget to look after us, and so we try
to pick our anxious way through the world’s mire, and forget
that the everlasting heavens bend above us. Well then it is
settled; we are going to be married, God willing, as soon as we
land, trusting that when one has asked God to show the way He
does not mischievously lead one astray. The main thing k to
keep our human wills absolutely flexible, so that He can turn us
m
uth I t°1U? ’ sh,ouId we haPPen to stray into the wrong path.
This flexibility I learnt with Harris, and I never saw more clearly
the use of my blind, my seemingly stupid, obedience, than I do
at this moment. I had to be broken in, and Harris was chosen as
an effective instrument, for a worse, a more unreasonable tyrant
than he came to be I never encountered. I do not pretend to say
that the servants of Christ must always find a Harris to aid their
development. Mine, I think, was a peculiar case; I was suffering
because of unchecked success in all I undertook to do. But such
an experience does yield this comfort to others. They may know
when fate permits them to be unmercifully bullied, that the
bullies will teach them a grand lesson, if they are willing learners;
namely, a perfect, an exquisite, flexibility to the touch of God.”
THE STORY OF M Y LIFE
On the following day, when we were comfortably settled side
by side, resting in a contentment which seemed as though it
could last for ever, Laurence said: “ I have been talking a great
deal about myself, but I have not heard a word about you. Now
begin from the very beginning and tell me everything. In the
first place, I have been looking up the history of your grand­
father’s Community, the Robert Owen Community at New
Harmony, where you were born, and it is certain that I must
mind my ways, for evidently you have been brought up in a
brilliant circle of men, and you will begin to snub me if I am
not on my best behaviour. This is the information I have gathered:
To begin with, it seems that your father, Robert Dale Owen, was
the influence which persuaded Abraham Lincoln to issue the
Emancipation Proclamation.” Laurence drew a notebook from
his pocket and quoted the following: “ When Emancipation
seemed to hang in the balance, Robert Dale Owen penned a
remarkable letter to President Lincoln under date of September iy,
1862. This masterpiece has been described as an ever-enduring
monument of dispassionate, well-reasoned, perfectly poised
deductions, at a very critical time in the life of a great nation. To
this day the reader of his eloquent appeal finds himself stirred
by the simple power of this great paper.
Its perusal thrilled me like a trumpet call,’ said President
Lincoln.
It will be a satisfaction to you to know,’ wrote Salmon P.
Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, to Mr. Dale Owen, ‘that your
letter to the President had more influence on him than any docu­
ment which reached him on the subject—I think I may say than
all others put together. I speak of that which I know from
personal conference with him.’
The Preliminary Proclamation was issued five days after the
receipt of Mr. Owen’s letter.” 1 ^

ROBERT OWEN’S NEW HARMONY COMMUNITY
L aurence again consulted his notebook: “ This little village
where you were bom, New Harmony, seems to be a remarkable
spot, for many of the great reforms of the United States seem to
have emanated from this small centre. You grew up in a stimu­
lating environment. This is what I have found in books I have
been consulting:
‘Notable as New Harmony was in its own time the perspec­
tive of years is necessary to an adequate portrayal of its
importance in American history. There the doctrine of universal
elementary education at public expense, without regard to sex
or sect, as a duty of the State, was first proclaimed in the Middle
West, and through the labours of Robert Dale Owen, more than
any other man, this conception of the State’s duty has found
expression in a common school system that is the glory of the
Republic. Through Robert Owen, William Maclure, and Joseph
Neef, Pestalozzi’s pupil, the Pestalozzian system of education
was first successfully transplanted to the United States. William
Maclures manual training school at New Harmony was the
second of its kind in the United States, and through that institu­
tion and its popular publications the ideal of technical training
r i “ this country- The infant schools
established at New Harmony by Robert Owen, “ the Father of
infant education, and conducted throughout the lifetime of the
communistic experiments, were the first of their kind in America

Institution. It was in New Ha g tlve father of the Smithsonian

RO BERT OW EN’S NEW HARM ONY COMMUNITY 37
a voice and vote in local legislative assemblages. New’ Harmony
became one of the earliest centres of the movement for the
abolition of slavery, forcibly and effectively voiced through
Robert Dale Owen; and he impressed upon American law the
modern conception of the legal rights of women.' New Harmony
gave to the West a system of Mechanics’ libraries from which
dates the beginning of general culture. This village gave the first
known American example of prohibition of the liquor traffic by
administrative edict. The religious toleration taught at New
Harmony has served as a leaven of liberality in religious thought,
until the narrow type of religion, which the Owenites so stead­
fastly opposed, has in a large measure disappeared. New Harmony,
therefore, was a centre of light, while it was still surrounded by
the trackless wild,” and its place in history has never been
adequately appreciated, Robert Owen’s failure being, in truth,
a most remarkable success, insuring lasting and widespread
results.’ ”
Yes, I acquiesced, “ you are right in saying that every
opportunity has been given to me in early life, and if I fail it will
be my own fault. You ask me to start at the very beginning, which
was before I was born, for I believe the child is influenced,
perhaps more than we know, by pre-natal influences.”
“ I agree with you,” said Laurence.
1 A few years since a bust of Robert Dale Owen, in memory of his long and
arduous labours for women, was erected by them.
M Y MOTHER
My mother lost a splendid boy some ten months before I came
into the world. He was called, in the village, ‘the little king,’ and
from all accounts must have been a wonderful child. He was
taken at the age of six, and when my mother heard the earth
drop upon his coffin she felt that her loss was almost more than
she could bear; for she, like my father, was inclined to be an
agnostic. Neither of them felt sure that there was an existence
after death. My mother told me that during the months before my
irth there was a ceaseless cry in her heart to know the truth - if
there was a God in heaven, she besought Him to reveal Himself
o her for she felt that she was fainting and failing by the way.
The answer which came will seem to some a strange one, for

grateful for the happy period upon which I now entered, for the
sane, sweet pleasures of the old homestead at New Harmony
have fortified me to bear the difficult years which followed. I still
thank God every day for the mother He gave me, for I have
never known a better balanced, a wiser woman, a woman who
was, in every way, worthy of a husband like my father, Robert
Dale Owen.
“ My father and mother were married before a Notary, and each
signed a Contract, wherein my father declared that he claimed no
rights over the person or the property of my mother. She was to
be as much the mistress of her own life after marriage as she had
been before. To this Covenant my father adhered throughout his
married life, and hence we were born of a willing mother, and of
a self-controlled father, who reverently respected her.
“ I am sure that the manner of our birth had its effect upon us.
We seem to have lived in what may be called a sphere of inno-
cency. That sin existed I knew, and I was deeply troubled,
mentally, by the impurities of the world. But, in some strange
way, these impurities did not seem quite to touch me. I lived my
own life in a world where they could not enter; and when I
happened to come in close contact with an unclean life I was not
only shocked, but ever freshly surprised at the existence of evil.
It is not for me to judge any sinner, and I have no desire to do
so, for I realize with the deepest gratitude to my father and
mother that my birth was different from the ordinary one, and
hence that I am not subject to the ordinary temptations. I do not
feel that the credit belongs to me, but to my beloved father and
mother.
“ My father was already a prominent man at the time of his
wedding, and an account of his marriage Contract found its way
into the newspapers. In those early days, even more than now,
such a Contract was unusual, and it was severely criticized. But
this condemnation in no wise alters the fact that because of this
marriage Contract, sacredly kept, my flesh and blood own a
blessed heritage, for which I am deeply grateful. It is rather a
strange thing that both my grandmother and my mother chose,
irrevocably, my grandfather and my father at first sight. My
grandfather, Robert Owen, was a raw, awkward youth when first
he met my grandmother, who was a well-born, well-bred lady.
Nevertheless, she determined, at the first meeting, to marry
Robert Owen, or to remain single. My mother heard my father

complicated, my mother gave up teaching us in order to devote
her time to him; for he never made a serious move without
consulting her. She sometimes wrote him fifteen or twenty W e

his political labours. I have often marvelled at her power of work

And yet, although her mental cares were exacting, she never

that the working men in the Community refused to do any labouf

42 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
and in consequence of their idleness the curse of drink had
invaded the town, through the influence of the surrounding
settlers, who furnished the liquor.
“ My mother met some of these difficulties in a novel way:
A ball was given every Saturday night in one of the large Rappite
buildings, to which the whole village was invited. Usually there
was only dancing, beginning at seven and ending at eleven, but
periodically there was what was known as a ‘supper ball,’ for
which my mother often baked fifty or sixty cakes and pies, tarts
I think you call them in England.
“ At these balls she, assisted by a committee of ladies, sought
in every way to unite the quarrelling factions; and dissipation
was overcome by the simple device of making a rule that no man
who had been drinking at all freely was to be accepted as a
partner. This rule was still followed when I grew to womanhood,
and no person whose conduct was not upright, in all respects!
couid find a partner in our ball-room. The result was remarkable.
friendly unity drew the villagers together, and the young men
of New Harmony were singularly free from vice, the standard
that they were to be as sinless as the young girls.
Only once was I obliged to enforce my mother’s rule, the
young man being a stranger in the village, the dissipated son of

“ It was a great treat when our father could be pressed into
seiwice for he was a very fine reader; but it was a rare one as
his public.duties frequently called him from home. It was our
mother who, almost unhelped, managed our household.
Often a number of young visitors joined the family circle
and fifteen or twenty of us gathered round the great wood fires’
the big logs blazing cheerily in the wide chimneys. But whether
we spent the evening at home, at the public halls, or at the
rehearsals of our Thespian Society, the hours were early and the
c othes simple. Except on grand occasions, we wore neat print
or plain woollen dresses in the ball-room. I especially remember
one print dress, called calico in America, having a little pink
spray on a white ground, and worn with a pink ribbon, which
my escorts seemed to admire very much.
“ We went to the dances before dark, in a little procession, arm
in arm, with our beaux, as we called our escorts, and danced for
two or three happy hours on a fine, smooth floor to the music
a goo an . Our escorts took us home, and we were allowed
to invite them into the drawing-room for a little chat, even though
my mother had retired; the only rule being that we should behave
precisely as we would were she present, a rule we were never
inclined to break, for we had so much happy, innocent fun that
neither we nor our escorts were tempted to spoil our enjoyment
y oing anything o f which we would afterwards be ashamed. It
was indeed a gay and an innocent little Arcadia over which my
beloved mother wisely presided.” 3

44 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
rules could be counted on the fingers of one hand, but they were
not always easy to obey, and they were always enforced. One of
these rules was that we were never to show the slightest ill-temper
or indulge in moody depression in any of the public rooms of
the house. If, for instance, one of us objected to the food on the
table, even by the slightest gesture of dislike, my mother would
say: ‘My child, you are not well, will you go to your room until
you feel better.’ Another rule prohibited ill-natured gossip, and
I never heard a breath of scandal in our home.
“ I was not whipped, nor even struck, so far as I can remember,
but once in my life, although my mother said I was more trouble
than her other three children put together, and, added to them,
the seven young people, needing a mother’s care, whom she
took into our home at different periods. When I was about five
years old I was fond of running away to stay all night with some
little friend. Finally, my mother gently warned me that if it
occurred again she would be obliged to whip me. I can distinctly
remember weighing the pros and eons of the situation. I asked
myself whether the pleasure of staying all night with a favourite
cousin of mine would not outweigh the pain of being whipped
the next morning when I returned home, and I decided that the
balances were weighted on the side of staying with my cousin,

“ An d now,” I said, with a constriction of the heart, as I recalled
the events which followed, “ I must tell you of the changes which
came to me. At seventeen I was sent to New York to finish my
education. I was to remain a few weeks with my father in Cincin­
nati until some literary work he had promised to do there was
finished, and then to go East with him.
“ I went to a neighbouring city, Evansville, in a stage coach,
a forlorn little mortal, curled up in a corner of the seat, for it was
a severe wrench to leave my home and part from all my young
companions. An old friend of the family was to take me under
his care from Evansville to Cincinnati. I remained with some
acquaintances overnight and was driven to the station the next
morning. When my ticket had been bought, and I was seated in
the railway carriage, the son of my intended escort rushed into
the tram and said his father had suddenly been taken ill and
could not go.

sat up in startled surprise. A gentleman was leaning over
M Y FIRST KN O W LED GE OF EV IL 47
the seat with a kind smile. I had noticed him in the earlier part of
the day, for whenever there was a short stop at a station he had
left the tram and had restlessly paced up and down, with a look
of ever-increasing strain on his face, which, although not an old
one, had a haggard look.
I thanked him and said I did not wish to lie down.
“ Presently he spoke to me again.
Pardon me,’ he said, ‘may I ask whether you are stopping
at Indianapolis, and have someone to meet you?’ s
iirrNo.’ 1 am going to Cincinnati, where my father is to meet me.’
He looked at the driving snow for a few moments. ‘I am
afraid the train may be detained at Indianapolis. We are very
much behind time, and I doubt whether you can go on to
Cincinnati before morning.’ °
“ I gave a gasp of dismay.
“ V ? V£ry SOrry’’. he said> in a singularly gentle voice, as
though he were speaking to a lost child. ‘If I can be of any use
to you, you have only to command me.’
Again I thanked him for his kindness, which gave me a sense
of comfort, and told him I had been put under the care of a
German, sitting at the other end of the train.
“ His fears for us proved to be correct, for we were detained
at Indianapolis. On leaving the train he courteously lifted his
hat, with a kind word to me, and again I was struck by the

morning, but when I saw the pictures of J. Wilkes Booth, the
murderer of President Lincoln, in the newspapers, I was greatly

we would have to find a hotel for a few hours and join the train

j • trudged after him, and presently he halted before a small
an/,y'i° 0kjnt hotel- He entered the house through the bar-room

M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E

late, and the bar was full of men, who looked at me in astonish­
ment, which was rapidly changing into a bold impudence. I
braced myself against the wall near the door and awaited, in
terror, the return of the German.
“ His big, burly form presently reappeared, and he cheerfully
informed me there was no room in that hotel, where he usually
stayed, and we must go farther, and look for another one.
“ We again plunged into the snow, calling at one or two places
—where I took care to follow him through the bar into the
house—and finding no room in them we made our way through
streets, which were ever narrower and meaner-looking, and
halted, finally, before a shabby building.
“ Again we entered through the bar, which was crowded with
a ruffianly set of men and evil-looking women, and I followed
him down a long, dark passage into a back room.
“ Here sat a woman whose face is still imprinted on my memory.
It was covered with sores, its ghastly pallor being ill-concealed
by the paint plastered over it; her leering eyes and loose, coarse
mouth were dreadful.
“ She said in a surly tone that there were rooms to spare, and
proceeded to light a candle and to conduct me to mine. The
German asked me if I would have some supper, but although I
had scarcely eaten anything all day, and was wet through, I did
not feel I could touch anything in that house.
I followed the woman, who took me to the second floor, and
entered a small, ill-smelling room, with a filthy bed in one corner.
She set down the candle and left me. When I came to examine
the door I found that there was no key and no bolt, so I could
not fasten it.
The bar-room was immediately below me and the sounds were
growing ever more riotous. I had thrown myself on the bed,
dressed, as I could no longer stand, shivering in every limb from
disgust, cold and terror, and presently I heard terrible sounds
from below. The crashing of furniture and of glass, oaths flung
backward and forward in violent altercation, and finally a door
was burst open, and the inmates of the bar rushed up the stairs
an a M g t e passages. Several of them lurched against my
door which I had barricaded with all the furniture I could move,
teU
r r i b l 7 “ T ^ relief °*e entered. I then passed two
terrible hours of suspense waiting for daylight.
About four o’clock in the morning someone pushed open my
M Y FIRST KN O W LED GE OF EV IL 49
door. I jumped from the bed and lighted the candle, which I had
extinguished as it was almost burnt out, and I saw that it was the
big, burly German. He moved the furniture and entered the
room. As soon as he came in I saw, to my horror, that he had been
drinking. He came towards me, with a horrible leer, and taking
me by the shoulders pushed me backwards against the bed. With
a cry to my Maker I wrenched myself from his heavy grasp,
sprang to the window, which I forced open, and, fixing my eyes
steadily upon him, I said:
“ <If y°u dare to touch me, I shall jump from this window,
and you will be guilty of my death.’
“ A Power greater than my own strengthened me; and I
continued to look him straight in the eyes, until he shrank from
my gaze and backed towards the door.
It is time to go to the station,’ he said, at last, cringing
before me.
“ ‘Very well, stand where you are, without moving, until I
get on my wraps. Now, take my hand luggage and go before me
without turning, and I will follow you until we reach the station.’
He obeyed me, and we trudged through the deserted streets,
he walking somewhat unsteadily before me. But evidently he was
sober enough to know the way, which I did not; for presently, to
my intense relief, we reached the station. When we entered the
waiting-room, I found there a kindly, elderly lady whom I had
noticed in the train the evening before.
“ She looked at me in startled surprise.
My child, you look ten years older than you did yesterday.
What has happened to you?’
“ ‘Are you going to Cincinnati?’ I asked.
“ ‘Yes,’ she said.
“ ‘May I sit near you?’ I begged.
Certainly, with pleasure. I will look after you until we reach
Cincinnati and your friends.’
I turned to the big German, who had been stupidly staring
from one to the other. ‘Put down my luggage,’ I said, ‘and do
not speak to me again—do you understand?’
When the man returned to Evansville, he begged my friends
to forgive him. It seems he had taken me to the cheap house

in such a world. I had seen in the face of the German the horror
of passion without love, the horror of lust; and when my com­
panion said that, alas, many men were thus disgusting, my whole
soul revolted.
“ The next evening the young man called on the family I was
visiting, and I at once left the room, for his presence was intoler­
able to me; and to his chagrin and astonishment I never spoke
to him again, always leaving the apartment as soon as he entered,
for I could not bear to touch his hand.
“ I was, however, able to rebuild my own sphere while living
in the world, so that no one could quite destroy it; and by
degrees a great pity filled me for these blind and stupid sinners,
who forgo the delights of innocency for so very poor a pleasure.
They did not know the fresh, sweet joy a pure soul owns, a soul
akin to all wholesome beauty, and I ended by being intensely
sorry when I looked at a coarse, heavy sensualist. He missed so
much and he had so little.”
Laurence shifted his position with a restless movement.
“ Please forgive me, Laurence, I am getting too serious, almost
didactic in my eagerness to explain to you a little what women
suffer who long to live in a clean world; and even more to make
you realize what a delight it is to be able to invite you into my
sanctuaries as one of my kin.”
This was the last long conversation we had, for our fellow-
passengers were beginning to claim our attention, and we had
little time to ourselves. I must leave, therefore, the story of my
life, and tell it directly to the reader after I have described the
events which now followed in rapid succession.

when I was awakened by the rhythmic beat of my mother’s

to me.
“ You look very solemn,” said Laurence, “ what is the matter,
dear child?”
“ I wish there was no such thing as ‘fuss and feathers’ in the
world,” I said wrathfully. “ I wish everybody wore pink cotton
dresses. If I am to have all sorts of things hung on to me and stuck
on to me, I shall look like a monkey.”
Laurence laughed the low, musical laugh which was so
contagious, and, at last, I was obliged to join him.
“ Possibly,” he said, when he had regained his breath, “ but I
hardly think so. Did your mother look like a monkey when your
father was Minister at the Court of Naples ?”
“ No,” I said, “ her common sense found a way of being simple
without being singular.”
“ Precisely,” said Laurence, “ and your common sense will come
to the rescue in the same way. I cannot imagine my little Puritan

awaited us.

such an environment. Perhaps he would be ashamed of me, for I
did not even have a suitable wardrobe; certainly no dresses fitted
to wear in the home of the future King of England. The bond
between Laurence and myself had been so unworldly, I had
forgotten the fact that there was a world, his world, to be reckoned
with. My mind suddenly flew back to the summer mornings
when I was awakened by the rhythmic beat of my mother’s
churn, and all the charm of our sweet, free, simple life returned

“I do not like Americans,” she said, “ and I am very sorry
Mr. Oliphant is going to marry one.”
“ If that is the trouble,” I replied, “ I cannot change the place
of my birth, if I would, nor would if I could. I am proud of my
nationality and shall always remain so, I hope. But if any of my
American ways offend you, I will do what I can to conform to
your ideas while I am in your home.”
“ I believe you to be a vampire,” she declared hotly. “ We all
think so. Mr. Oliphant looks much worse than I have ever seen
him, and I believe it to be your fault.”
The charge was so baseless that I did not answer it. Indeed,
her remark about Mr. Oliphant’s appearance struck such a chill
to my heart that her accusation passed almost unheeded, for it
was evident that those who had seen him in good health, which
I had not, found that he was much changed for the worse.
When I spoke to Laurence, he laughed at my fears.
“ I shall be quite right, little woman, as soon as we are comfort­
ably settled. But if it will be a relief to you, I promise to see a
doctor as soon as we go to London after our marriage. I made
all the arrangements the morning after we arrived in England,
and we are to be married in less than a fortnight,” he said, with
deep contentment.
A day or two before the appointed time I went to the shops
to buy a few necessary articles, and I realized with gratitude that
had I not been forewarned of my marriage while in the home of
Dorcas I should have been quite unpresentable, for I had been
so absorbed in my work that I had neglected my appearance, and
I had not had a moment to prepare since I had joined Laurence.
I did not possess a wardrobe suitable for Royal Courts; but, at
any rate, I was well enough dressed for ordinary occasions, and
to please Laurence’s eye, which was the main thing.
I had a number of small purchases to make, and so had been
away the greater part of the afternoon. On turning to leave one
of the shops, I saw Laurence standing at the door.
“ Rosamond, where have you been? I have searched for you
everywhere. Don’t leave me again for so long a time, I cannot get
on without you. Never mind the other purchases, come home,
that’s a dear girl.” He tucked my arm under his and looked down
at me with so deeply tender a look that I forgot at once the dis­

the physical chill of the cheerless day; but we two sat wrapped in
a sphere of blessed peace, and seemed invulnerable to the sur­
roundings which could scarcely have been more dreary.
When, after the short, simple ceremony, we two were settled
in the train on our way to London, Laurence turned to me and
again repeated:
“ Rosamond, are you happy?” I answered from a full heart,
“ I am, Laurence, happier than I ever thought it possible to be
on my wedding day, because I have always imagined that I should
be terrified if I ever ventured to be married. Instead, I feel
absolutely at home and as though I had known you for centuries.”
“ Thank God,” said Laurence. He then fell into silence, scarcely
speaking the rest of the way, and when we entered the brilliantly
lighted hotel, where we were to pass the night, I saw that he
looked very ill—so ill that I begged him to go to bed at once;
and, slipping on a wrapper, I watched over his restless, moaning
sleep for the greater part of the night. His face looked almost
ghastly as with closed eyes he moved uneasily on the pillow.
The next morning he seemed much better. Still I begged him
to see a doctor, which he did as soon as we had breakfasted. The
doctor did not seem to think there was anything very serious the
matter with him, and ascribed his laboured breathing, which had
grown ever more painful since we had left the boat, to a heavy
cold on the lungs.
He was able during the day to look through a quantity of
letters which had accumulated at his Club, and to receive visitors.
At night he insisted on dining with Lord and Lady Mount
Temple, who had returned to London and had sent us an urgent
invitation. He seemed to rally on seeing his old friends, and we
passed a most pleasant evening. The next morning we took the
train to pay a short visit to some English friends near London
whom Laurence had known in America.

As the painful days and n! u*
7 d ghtS wore on, Laurence felt a
LA U REN CE’S TRIUM PHANT EN D 61
growing dislike to the room in which he was. “ The wall-paper
shrieks at me,” he said, with a pathetic little smile; but I think the
main reason of his restlessness was the rather distressing atmo­
sphere of the house, for we both felt that we were in the way,
for which, as I have said, one could not blame our hosts.
Lady Grant Duff urged us, afresh, to come to her.
The doctor said to m e: “ Mrs. Oliphant, I believe that you will
be running a very serious risk if you move him; I warn you,
plainly, that he may die on the way. If you choose to take that
risk, it must be on your own responsibility.”
I was much troubled. I saw, on the one hand, that the environ­
ment was not at all favourable, and yet I dreaded running into
danger. Finally, after an especially restless day, I sent up a cry
for guidance, and the answer came to m e: “ Move him.”
I sent for the doctor, who promised to accompany us, and
wrote to Lady Grant Duff to send her carriage. Yani went ahead
to prepare everything for his master.
As the coachman and footman carried Laurence downstairs,
I perceived, to my dismay, that the coachman was stumbling in a
strange way and almost threw him out of the chair.
When we entered the carriage, the coachman started at a
break-neck pace, hurtling against the stones on the road. The
doctor called to him angrily, and as he turned we were both
dismayed to see that the man was under the influence of liquor;
evidently he had been drinking since he had left Lady Grant
Duff’s. The doctor and I looked at each other in dismay, but
Laurence lay back on his pillows, and gazed at the country scenes
through which we were passing with a smile of deep contentment.
It was a terrible strain and one I shall never forget, for I felt
that I had taken my husband’s life in my hands and that I should
be considered, and would almost consider myself, his murderer, if
he died on the way.
But in spite of the rough and rapid drive, which the doctor
in vain tried to check through quiet means— and he hesitated to
use violent ones, for fear of doing Laurence a greater harm—in
spite of this risk, we reached Lady Grant Duff’s in safety.
The doctor took the coachman’s place when Laurence was
carried upstairs, and helped him into bed. My husband lay back
upon his pillows and lifted his eyes in a silent prayer of gratitude.
Then he looked around the spacious, softly tinted apartment
?vith delight. Lady Grant Duff had been good enough to cede
6z MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
to us her own suite of rooms. A beautiful drawing-room with
three windows looking on the Thames, a large and lofty bedroom
littk dressing-room for me. Yani was comfortably
settled in the servants’ quarters. When the members of the family

But now Laurence was able to come to the rescue, and he was
deeply touched by the universal sympathy coming alike from
the highest and lowest grades of society.
As the days wore on a glad hope animated me. Perhaps the
doctor was mistaken, and Laurence might live. The possibility
that he might recover gave wings to my tired feet. My life seemed
to go into him and renew him, for every breath was a prayer.
But my joy was short-lived. Suddenly, he began to fail. He
had not as much pain as in the first dread weeks, but he grew
weaker and more emaciated day by day. He was now confined to
his bed, and could lie in only one position, which tried him to the
uttermost, especially as his poor body began to be covered with
bed sores. Lady Grant Duff brought, in her own arms and filled
with her own hands, a large water-bed, which gave him great
relief.
One night he seemed to be especially restless. I had rubbed
him for a long time, as was my habit when he seemed uneasy, but
my touch did not seem to soothe him as it usually did.
“ Rosamond,” he said at last, “ clasp my hands in yours, and let
us pray together to our Lord Jesus Christ, for I am going through
a great struggle. You remember that Judge R. and Lord S. and
Sir J. L. have been to see me this week, each remaining with me
for a short visit. I could only speak to them a few words, little
above a whisper, and yet I realized that I have had a greater
influence over these noted men, each of them distinguished in his
own sphere, than I have ever been able to exert before, although
they are old friends. Now Christ asks me whether I am willing to
lie bed-ridden for years, provided I can be of the same service to
all who come to me. No harder task could be imposed upon me.
You know my impatient nature, the hours seem like weeks; as I
look forward to each new morning I feel that my slavery is almost

Him in the way that He asks? Rosamond, pray with me, oh,

Him in the way that He asks ? Rosamond, pray with me, oh,
pray with me, so that I shall not fail Him.” The dread struggle
lasted almost until the morning, then Laurence said: “ I am
willing.”
As the day dawned and his face became visible, I saw that it
was illumined by a hallowed fight. From this time until his death,
which came a few days later, a deep peace rested on his wan
64 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
features, and he murmured, again and again, “ The Lord God
omnipotent reigneth.”
Is it any wonder that I fought for this man like a tiger, when
a few weeks after his death, his enemies sought to blacken his
memory. Mistakes he had made, doubtless, and I acknowledged
it; but may one find many natures in which the pure gold so far
outweighs the dross? Are there many men as good and as great

I drew her into the room, and she gazed in awe at his face.
“ I did not know that it was possible for death to be so beautiful,”
she said, “ I shall never be afraid again. A wonderful light seems
to play over his features, do you see it?” she asked.
“ Yes,” I said.
But now, on the afternoon of which I have spoken, the funeral
was over, the various tasks falling on me, as his widow, were
finished; and I sat, with idly folded hands, alone in the bedroom
where he had died. Once or twice I had turned quickly to look
at the bed where he had been lying so long, almost expecting to
see his dear eyes looking at me, and hear his dear voice calling
me. The great house, with its thick portieres and heavy carpets,
was silent; outside a dense fog blotted out the view and drifted
drearily into the room. My head and eyes were too weary to read,
or write, or sew; and, at last, I sprang to my feet with a cry and
began pacing the floor in an agony of prayer, for I felt that I
could not bear this solitude, I could not give him up and be
willing never to see his face again in this world. My life was too
empty. It seemed to me I could not endure it.
As I walked to and fro someone knocked at the door, and a
servant entered with a letter. I took the large envelope from the
tray, and, turning to the light, opened it. I found it contained a
number of Press notices of Laurence, among them being many
short notices of his funeral.
As I sat turning them over, with blinding tears, I suddenly
heard the words, almost as though they were spoken aloud:
“ Why, these newspaper fellows have buried me almost to death,”
and with them a rush of life seemed to pour through the room.

As I sat turning them over, with blinding tears, I suddenly
heard the words, almost as though they were spoken aloud:
“ Why, these newspaper fellows have buried me almost to death,”
and with them a rush of life seemed to pour through the room.
It was Laurence; I knew it, his vivid personality pulsed in the air
around me. But it was no longer a feeble invalid, a spirit battling
with the imprisoning flesh, but a spirit which was emancipated,
gloriously free, and yet it was Laurence, my dearest friend,
Laurence, joking as he had done when we sat side by side on the
steamer; and I laughed at the comical twist of his phrase, referring
to the numerous notices of his funeral: “ They have buried me
almost to death,” even as I had laughed in the days of our
betrothal. A veil seemed to drop from my eyes, and I knew that
those of us who are knit together in Jesus Christ cannot be
separated; we are one and indivisible. To all eternity Laurence,
Alice’s Laurence, would be my deeply loved friend. For a little
time His followers may be in different countries, and hence must
B
66 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
send messages rather than speak them audibly, but the widest
chasm which death can cleave has no power to sunder soul from
soul. I knew it, on that afternoon, once and for ever; and my
spirit broke from the bondage in which the evil ones had sought
to imprison it in order to drive me to despair.
Life, glad, wholesome, familiar Life is our portion; and death
is only a shadow to be ignored as we ignore all shadows, refusing
to give them the place and value of real substances.
If the reader has been bereaved, my prayer is that he or she may
become as sanely happy as I was on that blessed afternoon.
In the evening one of the children had a birthday party. They
were dancing, joined by their elders, in the great dining-room.
I went down and sat in a corner looking on, and the youngest,
happiest heart there did not fling its glad life on the wings of the
music more joyously than I did mine.
As I closed my eyes that night, I heard the words: “ Death is
delicious,” and I knew that Laurence was with me. He had
accepted, for Christ s sake, terrible pain and a lifelong bondage,
and his Master had given him, instead, the freedom of the heavens.
How great must have been the contrast, how glorious the release!
RO YA LTY
I left Lady Grant Duff’s home with regret, a regret deepened
afterwards by the fact that fate separated us, and I have never
seen her since.
A number of Laurence’s friends had urged me to visit them,
and I accepted two or three of these invitations, thinking that
he would like me to do so.
My first visit was to Lady Mount Temple. She also had lost
her husband, and I was much touched by the humble receptivity
of this great lady. Almost every morning there came a soft knock
at my door and a voice begged: “ Have you had your breakfast?
May I come in and talk to you?” My unwavering faith seemed to
comfort her in her affliction, and we spent many hours together.
During this visit Princess Christian asked me to call upon her.
Lady Mount Temple took great pains to train me properly, but
when I returned from the visit and told her the result she laughed
until the tears came.
At the doors of Buckingham Palace I was met by a very
imposing flunkey, and as we proceeded I was handed over, in
turn, to several others, until finally we reached the door of a room
where a gentleman awaited me.
He ushered me into the apartment, where I found Princess
Christian, and tried to make the bobbing little curtsy which Lady
Mount Temple had taught me. She managed it gracefully, but—
like my grandfather, when in correct Court dress he had been
received by the Queen— like him, I also “ felt like a monkey.”
I object to mourning and especially to widow’s weeds, for it
seems to me that it symbolizes a self-pitying reproach, questioning
whether our Maker has the right to take our beloved from us.
So I had never worn mourning until Laurence’s death, when I
reluctantly put a litde crape on a black dress and black hat in
my wardrobe, in order not to offend his family. But I had no
correct widow’s bonnet, etc., and it was thought necessary that
I should wear the regulation apparel on this occasion.
“ I shall never put it on again,” I said to Lady Mount Temple,
“ and I do not want to waste my money by buying the outfit in
order to wear it only once. I cannot afford it.”
68 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
“ Why not borrow my clothes?” said Lady Mount Temple.
“ Thank you very much,” I said, “ that will get me out of the
difficulty.”
She sent her bonnet and cloak to my room on the day of the
visit, and as she was a much larger woman than myself, I looked
as though I had put on an extinguisher.
I saw at once that Princess Christian’s quick eye detected that
I was wearing borrowed clothes, and she politely suppressed an
amused smile. I caught sight of myself in a glass, and my volu­
minous garments so eclipsed me that I was seized by an almost
uncontrollable desire to laugh. I was horrified, for I suppose it
is scarcely etiquette to go into fits of laughter when one first
comes face to face with Royalty. By an effort I controlled my
features, and then a new embarrassment arose; my tongue refused
to obey orders. Lady Mount Temple had made me repeat, “ Your
Royal Highness ” several times, and I seemed to be getting on
during my lessons; but when it came to putting my instructions
into practice, it was a dead failure. Twist my poor tongue as I
would, the words did not come glibly.
So, finally, I said to Princess Christian, “ Will you pardon me,
Madam, but my American tongue will not obey orders. It is
not lack of respect, but only lack of custom. Will you permit me
to set aside ceremony, as there is much you wish me to tell you
about Laurence, and I shall be able to tell it much better if I am
more at my ease.”
Princess Christian accepted my apology most courteously, and
we got on far more smoothly.
During the conversation I was haunted, however, by the
reflection that the people who had conducted me to the room
were waiting, probably, in the narrow, bitterly cold passage
outside, in order to conduct me back again; so when I had said
all that seemed necessary, I rose to go, in order to relieve
these attendants, who must be suffering, as it was a freezing
I saw a surprised look pass over Princess Christian’s face, which
her good breeding instantly suppressed, and I thought: “ Now
I have done something else which I ought not to have done, I
wonder what it is.”
When, on my return, I described my visit to Lady Mount
Temple, she was vastly amused. “ Well, my dear,” she said, as
soon as s e a regained her breath, “ I suppose you are the only
R O Y A LT Y 69
person living who has dismissed Royalty. No wonder Princess
Christian looked startled.”
When I left the Palace I was deeply thankful for my lot in life.
I can scarcely imagine a worse infliction than the one imposed on
royal persons, debarred from the simple ways of simple people.
Never to be allowed, in meeting one’s kind, to speak freely,
spontaneously, untrammelled, this seems to me to be a dire
infliction. One gets used to the heavy chains, I suppose, until
one scarcely knows that one carries them; nevertheless, a prisoner,
forced to walk by rule, must envy the free children going where
they will, led by the inspiration of the moment. Liberty is a grand
boon, and slavery, even though the chains be made of gold, must
needs be a curse.
So when I returned, I quickly stripped off my borrowed clothes,
put on an old hat and coat, and ran about in the Park near us,
rejoicing in the fact that I was not imprisoned in the strait-jacket
of stiff ceremonials, and could run unobserved, when, where,
and how I pleased.
But, although I am glad I was not born a Royal Princess, this
memory remains from the visit—no one could have been more
kindly considerate, more tactful, than was Princess Christian, for
it must have been a rather novel experience for Royalty to encoun­
ter so surprising a person as I appeared to be. Yet my high-born
hostess suppressed all signs of her astonishment or amusement,
the manners on her side being irreproachable.
But something more difficult awaited me than the effort to learn
a conventional courtesy. I finished my visits, and went to the
home of the friends who had left the Harris Community with
Laurence.
Several persons in different parts of England and Scotland had
intended to accompany Laurence to Palestine, forming altogether,
with those who were already there, a group of about sixteen
people. After his death I had written to those in Europe saying
that they would hesitate to go, probably, now that the master
mind could not lead them. But they had all elected to accompany
me, and so I went to the home of Laurence’s Harris friends, in
order to organize, from there, the journey to the Orient.
THE ATTACK ON LAU REN CE
T he evening after my arrival Murray’s card was brought to me,
and the servant said he awaited me in the drawing-room. I
hastened downstairs in glad surprise, for he was the dearest
friend remaining to me, made doubly dear because he loved
Laurence so deeply and sincerely. He had just arrived from
Scotland, hastening from the train to the house.
As I glanced up at the tall form, a chill struck to my heart, for
it seemed to be the face of a stranger which looked at me. Before
I had met Laurence, I had had a warmer affection for Murray
than for any man I had known, and had he not been thirteen years
younger than myself, and my superior materially in every way,
for he was rich and handsome, it is possible that I might have
permitted that love to grow. He now stood, his six feet four
inches of height, stiffly erect; his beautiful brown eyes, usually
so tenderly kind, coldly averted; and the lines of his striking young
face drawn with pain.
“ Murray, what is the matter?” I said in consternation.
He did not answer, but looked into my uplifted eyes as though
he would pierce through them to search the depths of my
soul.
I did not turn from him, for there was nothing hidden away
which I feared to reveal to him.
Then his face changed, a flood of reverent tenderness swept
over it, and taking both my hands in his, he said, “ I believe in
you, absolutely; come what may, I believe in you.”
He drew me down beside him on a sofa, and presently told
me his story, which amazed me beyond expression.
Many times was I destined to see, in the faces of others, the
look of stern questioning which, for a few moments, had hardened
Murray s face; but no attack, no matter how violent it became,
had the power to hurt me as that brief suspicion of me had done.
I did not know how deeply it had wounded me until it was gone,
and the familiar look of trusting affection had returned. Had
Murray remained alienated, the months which followed would
have seemed almost unbearable, but when he took my hands in
his and reverently kissed them, a load fell from me.
TH E A T TA C K ON LAU REN CE 71
In order to make Murray’s painful story intelligible to the
reader, I must go back a little and recall past events.
When Laurence and Murray were together in Paris, before
Laurence, after reading my letter to Murray, came to America
to find me, they had met a young American, a widow, studying
painting; sometimes she worked in the same students’ studio
as Murray, who was also a painter.
Laurence had thrown Murray and this lady (whom we will call
Jennie) together, in order to train them in self-control. It was,
I think, a mistaken course to take, as Laurence himself came
to see during our conversation on the boat. It is certain, however,
that it was in no wise meant to encourage self-indulgence, but
quite the contrary.
It was an unsafe situation, and it is much to be regretted that
the experiment was made, for although no gross sin resulted
from it, Murray was more and more drawn to Jennie, who, at
first, had no attraction for him, through those magnetic filaments
which, though invisible, may be very strong.
Finally, he became tentatively betrothed to her, and asked his
family to invite her to the handsome home which belonged to
them in Scotland.
Jennie had won him, in large part, by her protestations of
affection for the working classes, and she had promised Murray,
should they be married, to live with him in a plain, little house
among his father’s workmen, in order to serve them.
This had won Murray’s heart, for one of the griefs of his life
had been his inability to help, as he wished to do, the people
who laboured for his family. He hated to live in a sumptuous
house while the twelve hundred persons who toiled for him
lived cheerless lives. He had often told me that he took no pleasure
in his own luxurious surroundings. Again and again had he
urged reform, but he was not the master, as yet, and hence was
not able to do much.
Now, so he believed, he had found a philanthropist who would
help him when he took over the factories, and he discussed with
her many reforms, she making intelligent suggestions.
When Jennie had been in his father’s luxurious home for some
weeks, he became uneasily aware that she seemed, not unworldly,
but decidedly worldly; and he felt that in all probability she
would wish to join the ranks of the pleasure seekers, seeing that
she seemed to be intoxicated by the luxuries around her. In this
72 M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
role she did not appeal to him at all; for, had he been looking for
a fine lady in order to marry her, he certainly would not have
chosen Jennie, whose crudeness sometimes distressed him.
When the visit had come to an end, Jennie returned to America
and from thence wrote him extravagantly passionate love-letters'
telling him, finally, that without consulting him she had made all
the arrangements for their marriage, on a sumptuous scale, in
one of the great New York hotels, and urging him to come at
once.
He immediately telegraphed to her that it was impossible and
to cancel the arrangements.
These events had been taking place during Laurence’s illness,
and at this time Murray had sent me two letters, one from
Jennie and one from himself, in answer to Jennie’s, under the
same cover, in order to ask my advice in this distressing
emergency.
I had not heard of these events until these letters reached me,
and had supposed that the engagement was a happy one, destined,
probably, to end in marriage. Indeed, I had been so engrossed in
caring for Laurence that I had scarcely thought about Murray
and Jennie, or about anyone else. My whole life was being
spent for my husband.
When I took the two letters out of the envelope, I laid them
for a moment, separately, on a table. Then I took them up, one
in each hand, to place them in the envelope again, as I was
called away at that moment and could not read them. To my
amazement I was unable to put them together, for my hands and
arms were inflexible. Again and again I tried. I could place them,
separate y anywhere, but I could not unite them, my arms being
quite rigid whenever I tried to do so; and at last I gave up the

I did not wonder that his letters and hers could not be joined, for
his nature, possessing the calm serenity of the obedient child of

TH E A T TA C K ON LAU REN CE 73
unhappy woman, who seemed to be half mad because her ambi­
tious plans to have a “ grand wedding” had miscarried.
Yet I did not feel inclined to judge her because she was not
Murray’s equal, for it would have been difficult to find a woman
who was quite worthy of him. It was certainly not to her discredit
that she loved such a man fervently, and not her fault that they
had been thrown together, imprudently, so it seemed to me.
I wrote to him telling him of the strange experience with the
two letters, and he answered by return saying he thought it
symbolized, exactly, the state of things. He had been convinced
during her visit to his father that they were quite unsuited, his
aims and hers being totally different.
The experience with the two letters, which refused to be
joined, reached Jennie’s ears, repeated by someone who had
heard of the incident, and from that hour she had become my
enemy, declaring that I had separated them and that she would
make me suffer bitterly for it.
From this time she seemed to have been animated by a wild
energy; wherever she could discover friends of mine, she had been
to see them in order to pour out a torrent of accusations against
Laurence and myself.
A week before Murray’s visit to me, she had suddenly reap­
peared in Scotland, almost in a state of physical collapse. She
had then concentrated her fury on me, repeating with an intense
emphasis, which made her unfounded assertions appear like
truth, that my best friends had accused me of being a wicked
woman.
I believe that she was persuaded, in part, that she was right.
The experiment between Murray and herself had been an unwise
one; and, therefore, there was a foundation upon which she
could build. Again and again she had repeated to Murray that
Laurence was a wicked sensualist, and had deceived them all,
until he, Murray, was beside himself with the strain to which he
was being subjected. But, finally, her accusations became so
wildly improbable that he knew she must be mistaken, to a
considerable extent.
Murray had then decided to come and see me, although Jennie
had behaved like a mad creature when she heard he was
determined to make the visit.
I was exceedingly glad he had done so, for I felt he needed help.
As the evening wore away, the strained look left his features, and
74 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
we both felt that the tie between us, which had now lasted several
years, was more firmly knitted than ever. We left the painful
subject which had brought him to see me, and we drifted into
one of the long talks in which we both delighted, about social
reform, which was his keenest interest. As the only son of a rich
manufacturer, employing many work-people, the subject had come
home to him. He often wore very shabby old clothes and heavy,
unblacked boots, by way of showing his sympathy with those
who were obliged to be roughly clad, clothes which in nowise
brought him to their level, for his well-bred distinction refused
to be hidden. As a matter of fact, I found, later, that it was some­
thing of a disappointment to the work-people that their handsome
young master was not as well dressed as his rich companions. I
sometimes quizzed him a little, asking him how he expected that
his unbrushed boots, innocent of gloss, were going to bring about
a resplendent millennium? By the law of contraries? Or did he
expect a result because his reform was so far-reaching, seeing
that it began at the very bottom, his dirty boots, with many
inches to climb before the top of his high head, crowned by a
workman’s cap, was reached, and hence it was bound to succeed?
The old subject, which we had discussed many times, a subject
to which, as Robert Owen’s granddaughter, I was deeply inter­
ested, absorbed his attention, and so the hours sped away, and
eleven o clock struck before we were aware that the evening had
well begun.
When he rose to go, I saw that the strained lines had left his
fine face, the old comradeship in which we had both delighted
having been renewed with an added touch of intimacy, because
1m friendship had been tried and had not been found wanting.
God bless you, my friend,” I said to him as he bade me
good-night. “ Let us kneel down together and thank Him for
the great comfort He gives us through the bond between us,
now more firmly knit than ever.”
He kissed both my hands, with an exquisite courtesy, as we
rose from our knees, and said: “ You and I will defend Laurence
against the world, if need be. I shall not fail you, God helping
I heard nothing from him for a week or two. Then I received

for, like Laurence, he seemed very different from the ordinary
run of men around him.
As he approached, I saw that he was very pale, the pallor being
more noticeable in contrast to his jet-black hair and moustache.
His great height gave him the advantage of seeing over the
heads of ordinary men, and he soon discovered me.
His white face shone with pleasure when he took my hands in
his. “ I thank you, Rosamond, for answering my telegram
so promptly at this unearthly hour of the morning.” Then, looking
around, he drew me into a quiet nook screened off in the refresh­
ment room, and wrapping his travelling rug around me, for it
was freezing weather, he stood before me.
“ Well, my dearest friend, I have no one left to me in this world
but you. My nearest of kin have all turned against me, and I have
left my father’s house, a disgraced man, so I fear, to the extent
that the world’s unfounded accusations can disgrace one. A
spasm passed across his averted face, but it lasted only a moment,
then his beautiful eyes sought mine, and we looked at one another,
spirit answering to spirit.
“Is it your defence of Laurence which has cost you thus
dear?” I asked.
“ Yes,” he said. “ My good father declared at last that I must
either denounce Laurence or be repudiated by him and by my
family. I have chosen the latter.”
I took his hand, and we sat for a few moments without speaking,
as no words could express my emotion. He was being knit to
me, through his loyalty to Laurence, in an everlasting bond.
“ I have much to tell you,” he said, looking around to see
whether we were being observed.
“ Will you not come to the home of my friends?” I asked.
“ I am sure you would be most welcome.”
“ No,” he replied, “ I think it is wiser to continue my journey
at once.”
He settled me more comfortably in my corner, and ordered
some refreshments, which, however, he hardly tasted; although,
so he told me, he had scarcely eaten anything for twenty-four
hours.
Pushing the elate from him. he said: “ And now. dearest friend,

for, like Laurence, he seemed very different from the ordinary
run of men around him.
As he approached, I saw that he was very pale, the pallor being

some refreshments, which, however, he hardly tasted; although,
so he told me, he had scarcely eaten anything for twenty-four
hours.
Pushing the plate from him, he said: “ And now, dearest friend,
before I begin my sad story, let me tell you about the strange
feeling that has come to me. Yesterday, I could scarcely have felt
more solitary, for I seemed not to have a friend left in the world.
76 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
Now, I feel that I own in you a thousand friends, dearer than any
I have lost. God is great, He repays.” For a few moments he
could not speak, struggling with a deep emotion. It was plain
that his sensitive nature had been strained to the utmost, the
ordeal having been greater almost than he could bear. I gave
him my hand, and thanked God for the soothing power my
nurse’s touch seems to have; for, after a little time, the nervous
trembling which had seized him ceased, and the colour returned
to his face.
“ Do not tell me now, Murray, if you feel it to be too great a
strain.”
“ No, I wish to unburden my mind, it will do me good, for I
can speak to you as to another self, without fear and without
reserve. You are my second conscience. Ah, what an unspeakable
comfort it is, after one has been so completely misunderstood, to
find a friend from whom nothing need be hidden, because she will
understand everything.
I told you, continued Murray, “ that Jennie, poor girl, seemed
beside herselfwhen I said I must come to see you. When I returned
to Scotland, after my visit to you, I found her in a state of collapse,
it seemed as though she might die. The violence of her emotions
had completely prostrated her, and I felt a deep compassion for
her.
But in a day or two she rallied, her splendid vitality and native
courage, for she possesses fine qualities, coming to the rescue.
Finally, we had a terrible scene; and when she found that I would
not, that I could not, yield to her entreaties to turn my back on
Laurence and you, and to be married at once, she attacked me
wlt j itterness such as I have never conceived, and said she
intended to ruin my name and my future prospects.
“ T promise you,’ she said, ‘that I will not quit this place until
I have revenged myself. You are now considered the model
young man here; I will see to it that you are despised, and
deserted and mocked at by every friend you have.’ She flung a
ring a given her in my face, and fell back in her chair in an
almost fainting condition.

go and to remember that she meant to carry out her threat.
oun , in t e next few days, that Jennie was going from
TH E A T TA C K ON LA U REN C E 77
house to house among my kindred and friends, and I was told
that her story was believed, because she was even willing to
implicate herself in order to seek to unmask Laurence, and to
warn my friends into what depths I had fallen through his
influence.
“ My father demanded an interview, in which he said to me
that he would rather see me dead in my coffin than to know I
was a follower of Laurence Oliphant.
“ When this storm burst upon me, I went to my room, and,
flinging myself on my knees, I cried to my God for help, for I
felt I was reaching the edge of my endurance.
“ As I knelt there a strange answer came to me, Rosamond, a
simple little test, which set my mind at rest instantly.
“ ‘When your face was buried in Jennie’s lap,’ something
seemed to say to me, ‘and she convulsively drew you to her,
your proximity was most intimate. Was your imagination at
that moment perfectly pure? Could God have looked into the
depths of your heart, and would He have found there only a
deep reverence for the most beautiful thing He has created, a
woman’s form, to which He has revealed the holy mystery of
maternity?’
“ I listened in awe to my Mentor and searched my soul. ‘My
imagination was God-governed,’ I answered. ‘My Creator could
have looked through and through me and would have found no
unclean association.’
“ ‘Would this have been the case before you met Laurence
Oliphant?’ asked my Mentor.
“Again I examined myself. ‘No,’ I said, ‘I should have struggled
against it, but there would have been an uneasy sex consciousness,
separating me from my Creator instead of uniting me to Him.’
“ Then came to me a flood of joy, for I knew that, at last, at last,
my mind was clean; I was no longer ashamed to meet my God.
Every soul in my native city might condemn me, if they
chose. Jennie could blacken my name, as she was successfully
seeking to do, but I lifted my voice and said: ‘Bless the Lord,
O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name.’ He
had given me a gift no creature could take from me.”
Murray dropped his face in his hands, and when he lifted it
again it was like Laurence’s face when he had said, “ I am
willing. There, in that common little London eating-room,
with the common crowd jostling each other around the counter,
78 .M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
Murray’s face shone for a moment, like the face of an angel. The
great city held its measure of sin, but that one look, as Murray
lifted his face in prayer, seemed enough to atone, heavenward,
for all the evil the night had known.
“ Only God, and perhaps you in part, can know what this
meant to me,” he said. “ I am a passionate man, and my passion
has been my torment. Temptation seemed to lurk everywhere,
even in a woman’s garment hung on a drying-line. There was a
time when it seemed an endless struggle, day and night, to pre­
serve my purity; and I meant that it should be preserved, God
helping me. I tried every device, making myself thoroughly
uncomfortable, physically, like a monk. It was a sort of obsession,
which gave me no rest, and yet in the midst of it, I knew that a
false glamour deceived me, the allurement was a poor thing.
Again and again, I said this, and yet again and again was I blindly
tempted.
“ So you may know how I rejoiced when I sprang to my feet
a free man. Laurence Oliphant has helped to teach me this
secret, and as long as I live shall I thank him.
“ I am still weary and weak physically, for I have been through
a long strain, but my torment is over, I am at rest.” He stretched
his long limbs and folded his hands behind his head for a moment,
saying with a joyous laugh: “ At last, I have time to take breath.”
“ Eat a litde more,” I coaxed, “ and then tell me the rest.”
He took a little food, and then pushing back his plate, said:
“ There is not much more to tell, and I must be off as soon as
possible.
“ When the moral burden had dropped from me, my mind
became clear, and I was able to decide, rapidly, what course I
ought to take. It was of no use, at this juncture, to reason with
those who surrounded me. Jennie, as I told you, was even ready
to blacken her own name, if it would help to blacken mine, and
Laurence’s, and yours.
“ I need not tell you,” said Murray, “ that there was nothing
resembling an ordinary liaison between Jennie and myself, she
was and is, so I believe, what is known as an honest woman.
Were she not, I could never have cared for her at all, for a coarse
woman is utterly repugnant to me. But she was a bitterly disap­
pointed woman, having some just ground for her anger, and I
did not know to what length she might go in the almost insane
desire to revenge herself, which momentarily possessed her ;
TH E A T TA C K ON LA U REN C E 79
and much as she had hurt me, I did not wish her to do anything
which would cast a lasting slur on her own name, and cast it
unjustly, a course of action she would bitterly regret as soon as
she came to her senses.
“ With regard to my own experience, I am absolutely certain
that the trial Laurence suggested has taught me a far greater
self-control, and it would grieve me deeply were Jennie to do
herself, unfairly, a lasting harm through the mad desire for
revenge which now animates her, poor girl.
“For her sake, then, as much as my own, I decided to leave
Scotland, for I felt tolerably sure that calm would not be restored
so long as I remained in my native city.
“ The night before last I engaged a carriage to come for me
at four o’clock yesterday morning. The coachman and myself
quietly carried my luggage downstairs, and I quitted my father’s
house like a thief in the night, without letting anyone know I was
leaving or where I was going, as I feared detention. As I settled
myself in a corner of the carriage which was carrying me away
from home, I remembered that I was making this dramatic
exit because I have fought—with all my strength I have fought—
to live a pure life. My relation to Jennie had been the outcome of
this desire; I had consented to our intimacy solely because I
wished to use it as a means of fortifying my self-control. It may
have been, take it altogether, a mistaken means, but it certainly
was not a self-indulgent course to take— quite the contrary— for
it entailed a severe struggle and, I may say, in the main, a successful
one.
“ So here was I, running away like a criminal from this sleeping
city, holding, I imagine, few young men who had battled as I
had done to live clean lives; young men who, in spite of their
self-indulgence, were well received in society. The situation was
so upside down that it turned from tragedy almost into comedy,
and I thanked God for His goodness in showing me the lighter
side, for I was near the breaking-point, physically, and a good
laugh saved me and in some way brought Laurence very near to
me.
I stopped on the way to London, to transact some necessary
business en route connected with obtaining a sum of ready money
from a bank where I had a deposit, took the night train when it
was successfully finished, and here I am.
I am fully prepared to find that my father and other relatives
8o M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
may disinherit me; for I have gathered as much from what has
been said to me. As my father’s only son, I should come in for
a large income, and, so I understand, other relatives, all prosperous
people, had signified their intention to leave me considerable
sums of money. I should have been, therefore, a rich man had I
elected to remain at home.”
Murray stopped for a moment, a sharp spasm crossing his
face, then he resumed:
“ My plan is to go to Paris to-day, give up my studio, and then
make my way to some village in the South of France, where I
can live very cheaply. I know the district, for I have tramped
through it as an artist. I will send you my address when I am
settled, and join you at Marseilles when you sail for Palestine.
I shall come to you almost penniless, for I have only about three
hundred pounds in my pocket, and it is probably the last money
I shall ever obtain from home. Will you take me with you, seeing
that I am almost a beggar?” he asked, turning to me with a wistful
little smile.
“ My income will be a modest one,” I said, “ when everything
is settled, but I will share it with you to the last penny.”
“ I hope I need not be a burden,” said Murray rising and
drawing himself to his full, splendid height. “ I was, often, the
designer in my father’s factory, and I think I may say a successful
one. So I have a trade and can make a living, I hope, when matters
have quieted down, but for the moment it is best I should leave
Europe, I think.
“ You remember,” he said, with a little emphatic nod at me,
“ that you thought me something of a crank, because I lived in
Paris, in one room, doing my own cooking, when I had a rich
father giving me a sufficient income? Well, the experience will
now serve me; I have already accustomed myself to poverty,
for there seemed to be a premonition in me, somewhere, that it
was best to grow used to hardship.”
“ You were right and I was wrong,”1said,“ but I never imagined
it possible that a father having a son like you—for you are a
splendid man, my friend—could have turned against you. He has
known you since you were born, how could he fail to under­
stand you? How strong must the powers of evil be, when they
can blind a good man like your father to the fact that he has a
son for whom he ought to thank God every hour of his life.”
THE ATTACK ON LAURENCE 81
hair was thrown back with a fine sweep from the regular, finely
chiselled face. The eyes, tenderly gentle in expression and beauti­
ful in form and colour, looked at me with fearless candour.
The lips, brightly scarlet, but clean cut and pure in outline, smiled
at me winsomely, revealing white and even teeth, shaded by a
handsome black moustache. He was a beautiful creature, this
repudiated son. How could a father who had received such a
gift from God, how could he separate himself from his only
boy because he was a faithful friend to a good man, Laurence
Oliphant?
The case was so extreme that then and there I made up my mind
not to judge our persecutors, for they must be blinded and
tempted in a manner which was beyond my understanding.
It gives me great pleasure to add at this point that I in nowise
regret having withheld any harsh criticism I might have been
inclined to make, for the sequel proved that Murray’s father
had always continued to love his noble son, and in the end he,
the father, behaved in a generously kind manner to myself, even
though he had, to the last, no faith in me, so it seemed.
With regard to his impression concerning myself, I was not
inclined to judge him at any time; for he does not know me, and
he has heard only evil of me, some of my near friends having
turned against me. So I have never been surprised at his attitude
towards myself, and I came to feel a warm gratitude for the
much-needed succour he regularly sent me in the end.
The favourable events of which I here speak followed years

may disinherit me; for I have gathered as much from what has
been said to me. As my father’s only son, I should come in for
a large income, and, so I understand, other relatives, all prosperous
people, had signified their intention to leave me considerable
sums of money. I should have been, therefore, a rich man had I
elected to remain at home.”
Murray stopped for a moment, a sharp spasm crossing his
face, then he resumed:
“ My plan is to go to Paris to-day, give up my studio, and then
make my way to some village in the South of France, where I
can five very cheaply. I know the district, for I have tramped
through it as an artist. I will send you my address when I am
settled, and join you at Marseilles when you sail for Palestine.
I shall come to you almost penniless, for I have only about three
hundred pounds in my pocket, and it is probably the last money
I shall ever obtain from home. Will you take me with you, seeing
that I am almost a beggar?” he asked, turning to me with a wistful
little smile.
“ My income will be a modest one,” I said, “ when everything
is settled, but I will share it with you to the last penny.”
“ I hope I need not be a burden,” said Murray rising and
drawing himself to his full, splendid height. “ I was, often, the
designer in my father’s factory, and I think I may say a successful
one. So I have a trade and can make a living, I hope, when matters
have quieted down, but for the moment it is best I should leave
Europe, I think.
“ You remember,” he said, with a little emphatic nod at me,
“ that you thought me something of a crank, because I lived in
Paris, in one room, doing my own cooking, when I had a rich
father giving me a sufficient income? Well, the experience will
now serve me; I have already accustomed myself to poverty,
for there seemed to be a premonition in me, somewhere, that it
was best to grow used to hardship.”
“ You were right and I was wrong,”1said,“ but I never imagined
it possible that a father having a son like you—for you are a
splendid man, my friend—could have turned against you. He has
known you since you were born, how could he fail to under­
stand you? How strong must the powers of evil be, when they
can blind a good man like your father to the fact that he has a
son for whom he ought to thank God every hour of his life.”
I looked up at the tall, slim form before me. The thick black
THE ATTACK ON LAURENCE 81
hair was thrown back with a fine sweep from the regular, finely
chiselled face. The eyes, tenderly gentle in expression and beauti­
ful in form and colour, looked at me with fearless candour.
The lips, brightly scarlet, but clean cut and pure in outline, smiled
at me winsomely, revealing white and even teeth, shaded by a
handsome black moustache. He was a beautiful creature, this
repudiated son. How could a father who had received such a
gift from God, how could he separate himself from his only
boy because he was a faithful friend to a good man, Laurence
Oliphant?
The case was so extreme that then and there I made up my mind
not to judge our persecutors, for they must be blinded and
tempted in a manner which was beyond my understanding.
It gives me great pleasure to add at this point that I in nowise
regret having withheld any harsh criticism I might have been
inclined to make, for the sequel proved that Murray’s father
had always continued to love his noble son, and in the end he,
the father, behaved in a generously kind manner to myself, even
though he had, to the last, no faith in me, so it seemed.
With regard to his impression concerning myself, I was not
inclined to judge him at any time; for he does not know me, and
he has heard only evil of me, some of my near friends having
turned against me. So I have never been surprised at his attitude
towards myself, and I came to feel a warm gratitude for the
much-needed succour he regularly sent me in the end.
The favourable events of which I here speak followed years
later, and will be explained in due course.
I perceived, in these first days of our trouble, that it was my
simple duty to commend my enemies into the hands of God
and to do all that lay in my power to calm the storm. So I tried

singing to me, with his fine bass voice, the songs in which
I delight.
For the moment, however, we were still at the beginning,
consulting in the railway refreshment room as to the future.
“ You wrote me that your nieces and the husband of the eldest
one, Grace, were coming to join you. Is this settled?” asked
Murray.
“ Yes, I received a cablegram yesterday from America, telling
me they are en route. Hence we shall soon be able to join you at
Marseilles.”
“ Ah, I am glad to hear it,” he said. “ Who knows, perhaps I
shall find a new family life, where I can be of greater use than I
was at home. Will you adopt me as a member of the Owen
family?”
“ With all my heart, and I believe Grace and Margaret, my
nieces, will love you as much as I do. You have lost a good deal,
Murray, for right’s sake, and you will find it all again, enriched
a thousand-fold.”
He rose with cheerful energy. “ For the moment,” he said,
dropping his voice, “ I must look up the train to Paris, and be
gone as soon as possible, for I am still the villain in the play,
shadowed, it may be, by detectives—who knows?” He glanced
at two men hovering near us, who were evidently trying to hear
what we were saying. But when they saw we were observing
them, they disappeared, and Murray, following them, saw them
leave the station.
We parted with a happy “ A u revoir,” full of hope for the
future, which was to contain so much joy, and, at last, so fatal
a tragedy.
A few days later my nieces, and the husband of the eldest one,
Grace, arrived; she had been married since I had left America.
How glad, how very glad, I was to see them. We remained only a
few days in England, leaving for Marseilles as soon as possible.
There Murray joined us, and I felt, at once, that he and my dear
children were akin. The rest of the party had sailed from Scotland,
so our little company was made up of the members of my own
family, for I now counted Murray as one of us.
T H E TEM PTATIO N
As soon as we were comfortably settled, Murray told me the
story of his experiences since he had left me at the London
station.
“ I remained only one day in Paris, came to the little village
in the South of France, the address of which I sent you, and
took a room in a small country hotel, where I had formerly
stayed.
“ I noticed on the first night, when I came to the table, a very
beautiful woman, and was told she was, or had been, the mistress
of a rich Count, whose fine country seat could be seen from the
windows.
“ A day or two afterwards, I found that she had moved to the
room next mine and that there was a door of communication
between the two rooms.
“ I had been detained downstairs one night rather late. A pro­
fessional mesmerist was staying in the house, and he had said
in the presence of several men, including myself, that he meant
to bring a pretty servant of the hotel under his power in order
to wrong her. He said to us:
“ ‘Watch the process, it will be interesting, and may be of
use to you later.”
“ A flash of wrath went through me, and I said to him: ‘I
want to make a bargain with you. If I can bring you under my
power, will you promise me not to ruin this girl?’
“ He sneeringly answered that I would find it a very hard task,
but if I succeeded he agreed to leave the girl alone, and he would
keep his word.
“ I sent up a fervent prayer for the pretty, innocent young girl
he meant to ruin; and taking his hands in mine fixed my eyes upon
him. I made no attempt to coerce him through my own will,
I only prayed most earnestly for help.
“ In a few moments, he fell back against the wall in an almost
fainting condition, and would have fallen had not a bystander
caught him.
“ ‘Sapristi!’ he said, when he had recovered, ‘you are the
strongest mesmerist I ever met. Where did you learn it?’
84 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
“ ‘From God in heaven,’ I said. ‘I have prayed Him to protect
this poor girl and He has answered me.’
“ The man stared at me—‘Oh, you’re that sort, are you?’
“ ‘Precisely, I am that sort.’
“ ‘Well,’ said he sullenly, ‘I don’t know how you did it, but,
at any rate, I will keep my promise.’
“ I shook hands with him cordially, and said: ‘There is just
one thing I should like to ask of you: Don’t do to the wife, or
sister, or daughter of another man, what you would not like that
man to do to your own wife, or sister, or daughter. That is fair
play, my friend, and a man of courage likes fair play. It is only
cowards who are bullies.’
“ ‘There is some sense in what you say, and I’ll think it over.
But you needn’t tell me you’re not a mesmerist. I never felt such
power in my life. If you’re ever out of a job, let me know, and
I’ll get you work in my own line; here’s my card.’
“ If I fail as a painter or as a designer, Rosamond, I have a new
opening, you see,” said Murray laughing.
“ Well, to continue my story: I had gone to my room late,
and was stretching my tired limbs—for I had been tramping all
day carrying my painting kit—when the door between my room
and the next was opened. There was a brilliant light in the adjoin­
ing room, and the woman I had noticed downstairs stood in
the door in a transparent muslin nightgown plainly revealing her
form, and with her waving blonde hair falling about her. It was
a vision of sensuous beauty.
“ She stood for a moment looking at me, then she stretched
her beautiful arms towards me and slowly backed into her own
room, leaving the door open.
I rubbed my eyes, thinking I was dreaming, but I was soon
persuaded that it was a reality, for she appeared again, and when
she retired began to sing a passionate French love-song in a
sweet, low voice.
Rosamond,” said Murray, “ do you not agree with me that one
of the hardest trials to which we can be subjected is the recurrence
of a temptation which we believe we have permanently overcome?
When I thought myself to be a free man, that evening in my
ather s home, I hoped that no sex temptation would ever again
violently assail me.
On this night, in the French hotel, the exertions of the long
ay and the effort of the evening had exhausted me, so that I
THE TEMPTATION 8j
was in a negative state, my will seeming to be dormant, and the
powers of evil took that unguarded moment to pour a hell of
desire through me. My veins seemed to be running fire.
“ I could not meet the attack, for it was greater than any power
of resistance which I possessed. So, as I had cried to my God to
protect the young girl downstairs, I now cried to Him to save
me. As I offered up my prayer, the woman appeared for the third
time. She was the incarnation of seduction. Languid, half-closed
eyes, parted lips, heaving bosom, sinuous body, seemed to be
used by ten thousand devils to draw me irresistibly to her.
“ Had I never believed in our Lord Jesus Christ until that
moment, I should have believed in Him then; for He, who so
compassionately understood the struggle of those tempted to
sin as I was now being tempted, He helped me to resist. There
was no condemnation, for He knew I was helpless, but there was
an all-embraqing Mercy; He helped me to rise, He led me to
the door, and He gave me the strength to withdraw the key,
to lock the door on my side, and to fling the key into the
garden.
“ The next morning I met the woman in the passage. She was
beautifully dressed, and she swept by me with haughty anger.
She was a splendid creature, and my heart ached for her, for
during the long, wakeful night God had shown me the end of
such a life, and had revealed to me, as I had never seen it before,
the hideous selfishness from which men, from kings to beggars,
are not immune— the selfishness which is willing to pile all the
penance on the woman, while the man, her co-sinner, may claim
for himself fame, honour, and even the highest posthumous
praise.
“ The old age of this beautiful woman had been shown to me.
I saw her cursed with bitter memories, unblessed, unloved,
dishonoured, and in contrast to this I had seen her paramour,
a noted leader, praised, it may be, by all the world. I had pitied
her with all my soul. Therefore, as we reached the head of the
stairs, I put out my hand and took hers.
May the Virgin Mary help you,’ I said.
“ A spasm crossed her face. ‘ It is my good mother’s prayer,
always,’ she said, turning from me with a sobbing breath, ‘but
I was born a wicked girl, Monsieur, from the beginning.’
She ran rapidly down the stairs, and stepped into a handsome
carriage waiting for her at the door. I did not speak to her after-
86 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
wards, but I have hope for her, seeingthat she had confessedher
sinfulness.
“And now I shall not boast again,” said Murray, “that I am
free for ever, but it does seemto me that I can never again be
tempted so fiercely, and it is certain that we always go forward
with afreshfaith, anewcourage, when, tried beyondendurance,
H
ehashelpedusto conquer.
“So, Rosamond, I feel like a happy youngster, and do not
be surprised if I behave like one, at any rate during the voyage.
When we reach Haifa, and become a Society of Reformers—for
I suppose that is what we are humbly trying to be, is it not?—
I must put on my robes of office, but in the meanwhile let us
throwcareto thewinds.”
“I heartily agree,” I said, “for, after all, we were born to be
Mercuries, not moles, so the chief aimin life is to grow wings.”
We had a happy voyage, until we reached Port Said, which
mightily refreshed us, and it was well, for trouble and to spare
awaitedusat theother end.
THE HOLY LAND
A violent storm overtook us as we left Port Said to go up the
Syrian coast. Cook’s tourists filled the first class, and we were
obligedto take berths in the second, the accommodation consist­
ing of a large room, with a double row of berths around it,
where men, women, and children were herded together. The
sm
ell was, as someone said, so strong one could lean against
it, there being not a particle of ventilation. My youngest niece,
M
argaret, contented herself with the dining-table as a bed,
where, rolled in a rug, she slid up and down over the slippery
oilcloth, at the risk of breaking her neck. There was not even a
seat to spare. Arabs, Greeks, Italians, etc., filled every crack and
cranny. Those of us who had been given dirty berths were
watching her, rather anxiously, from our ill-smelling niches,
am
used, as morning broke, to see that she had managed to sleep
tranquilly throughout the stormy night. The Arabs lying on the
benches, placed at either side of the table, pushed her into
position whenever the boat gave a great lurch andshe was in
danger of falling off. She rose in the morning with her placid,
blondebeautyunimpaired, abeautyreverentlyadmired, evidently,
by the swarthy Arabs around us, who had been civilly kind in
their care ofthe sleepinggirl.
This small coasting steamer (now replaced by sumptuous
vessels) pitchedand tossed, as the night advanced and the storm
increased, until it seemed as though she meant to turn over
completely.
As we neared Haifa, I managed, being a fairly good sailor,
to m
ake my way on deck in order to reconnoitre. In the pitch
darkness I stumbled over a number of cows and sheep, carried
as cargo, and finally found a place where I could stand. I
saw the lighthouse in the distance and watched it coming
nearer and nearer; then it seemed to lie behind us. As one
of the crew passed me, I asked him when we should reach
H
aifa.
“Haifa,” he said scornfully, “we shall not go into the Haifa
harbour on suchanight, we are headed for Beyrouth.”
I went downstairs again. Murray was lying cramped in one of
88 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
the short berths, manfully struggling with seasickness, andGrace
was in the berth below him, too ill to speak.
“Well, how soon shall we be there?” he said.
“We have passedHaifa, andaregoing to Beyrouth.”
‘The devil,” said Murray, and turned over without another
word. It was the only time I ever heard himswear, if “the devil”
may be called swearing, and certainly the occasion warranted it.
The next day, when we struggled on deck, we heard fromthe
passengersacquaintedwith the coast that we mightgobackwards
and forwards between Beyrouth and Port Said several tim
es
without touching Haifa. This was cheerful newsI
Happily, we did not have to suffer this penance, and entered
the Haifa harbour on our return journey, the storm ceasing as
quicklyasit hadbegun.
In coming from Beyrouth I had been annoyed by an Arab,
who had seatedhimself opposite my berth and had stared at m
e,
off and on, throughout the night. He had a bloated, dissipated
face, and seemed to be recovering from a drunken spell.
When we were entering the harbour, he approached m
e,
and to my surprise addressed me in rather good French.
“Pardon m
e, but you are Mrs. Laurence Oliphant?” he said.
“Yes,” I answered.
“I hope you will command my services, if I can be of any use
in landing.”
I thanked him, and told him a friend was coming on board
to meet us.
I did not then know that this man, whom I will call M
ustafa,
was to be the bane of my life, and to bring on me, at last, the
worst blowIcouldsuffer.
When the boat was anchored, a swarm of small boats
surrounded us as if by magic; and a horde of yelling Arabs
clambered up the sides of the vessel and over the deck in the
twinkling of an eye. A number of them were eager to grab our
baggage and to row us on shore. But we managed to keep out
oftheir clutchesuntilour friends arrived.
We sawthemapproaching, as we looked over the side of the
vessel; one of the members of the party which had sailed from
Scotland, and a gentleman already established in Laurence’s
home, being in a small boat. As soon as I caught sight of their
faces, I knew there was trouble in store for us, for there was
no smile of greeting, not even a wave of the hand, although the
THE HOLY LAND 89
young Scotchman—a man I came afterwards to esteem highly
—
hadbeen one of Murray’s oldest friends.
They cam
e on board, greeted us formally, and we were taken
on shore. When we had rattled through the narrow, rough, ill­
sm
elling streets of the Arab town, and had reached the Temple
Colony, where our house was situated, I was agreeably surprised.
N
eathomes were setin pretty gardens, and the streets were wide,
well-kept, and shaded. It was the abode of a German religious
sect.
It was the month of March, but the sun was already rather
oppressively hot, and the vine-covered entrance to our home
seem
ed delightfully green and cool. We were met at the door
bythe English lady left in charge of the house, a lady belonging
to the family of the Harris remnant, who conducted us to our
rooms, which seemed havens of rest after the discomfort of the
boat. But she also had rather a frigid manner, and when we had
beenleftalone mynieces ran into my room, and Grace, with her
bright charm, whispered dramatically: “Aunt Rosamond, let’s
goback, it seem
s to be warmer at the Poles than in the Tropics.”
She spread out her hands before an imaginary fire, and said
solemnly: “I’mabout to freeze.” We all laughed at her fun, and
felt better.
“What ails them, do you think?” asked Margaret, with her
placidmien, which could not easily be disturbed, so long as she
hadher dear sister Grace by her side, whom she loved with the
deepest devotion.
A few moments later my niece’s husband brought in a great
bundleofletters;two orthreeaddressedtohimselfhehadopened,
therest hehandedto me.
Grace grasped him by the lapels of his coat, and said in her
winsome way: “Now, Charlie, please don’t go racing off, either
to the North Pole or to the South Pole, but come and sit by me,
cosy and comfy, on the equator, that’s a good boy; don’t miss
your opportunities, we are here, not to freeze, but to make the
mostofthe sunshine.”
I understood at once what she meant, for the face of her
husband was much disturbed, seeming to reflect the cold stern­
ness surrounding us. To my surprise, he did not look at Grace
or laugh at her badinage, which generally amused him very
m
uch.
Whenthegirls hadleft the room, he saidto me:
MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
“Aunt Rose, read this.” He handed me a letter from America.
I glanced through it, and looked at himin consternation whenI
had finished it.
This letter, from a relative of Charlie’s, accused Laurence and
myself of teaching all sorts of pervert sins to young people. It
stated that aparty might be sent officially from the United States
to investigate our crimes, and to take anyactionthatwasthought
necessary to suppress our evil teaching. Details were thengiven,
which I will not quote, for they spoke of sins of which I had
scarcelyheard.
“Charlie,” I urged, “say nothing to Grace and Margaret, for
the present. Let themenjoy two or three care-free weeks in this
new land.”
“But I do not wish my wife to be mixed up in so scandalous
anaffair. I think we ought to return home, at once, and take
Margaret withus.”
The words cut me like a knife. The mother of these children
had died when they were still young. Margaret being little more
thanababy,and I hadhad the careof them, off andon, fromthat
time until they were grown up. No inspiration that prayer could
reveal to m
e had remained unsought; no labour that common
sensecouldteachmehadbeensparedto makethemgoodwomen.
God knewthat mywhole soul hadgone into my task. Again and
again had my brother said to me: ‘Rose, I have perfect trust in
you with regard to the training of my girls, they are my comfort
and my delight. ’ Had anyone accused me of wishing to murder
them, I couldnot have beenmore astonished than I was, whenit
was said that I was leading them astray, morally.
Charlie, I said, somewhat sternly, “give me your promise
that you will not speak to Grace. It would be cruel. Everyone
seem
s to be mad, and we must wait a little for developments.”
Charlie was a clever young American with a kind heart, and
passionately devoted to his wife; a sympathetic young man.
At last he said: “Of course I know, Aunt Rose, that there is
not a word of truth in all this, it is simply the look of the thing
t at do not like. But Iwill do as you wish, for Grace’s sake as
well as yours.”
When he had left m
e, I opened my own letters, and in one of
emt ere was a repetition, in a milder form, in more moderate
terms, of the accusations in Charlie’s letters.
henextmorningtheyoungScotchman askedfor aninterview,
T H E H O LY LAN D 9 1
andhe told me that he and his companion had been pursued by
telegram
s on the way, sent by their families, who insisted upon
their immediate return. “Mr. Oliphant is accused of havingbeen
a teacher of dangerous doctrines,” he said, “and my mother is
m
uchtroubledbecauseI amwith you.”
“Doyou wishto return?” I asked.
“No, I do not. I amhere, andwish to stay. But you canunder­
standthat my position is not a comfortable one. It grieves me to
give anxiety to my mother.”
Thisfirstdaywas asampleofthe daysthatfollowed. Theyoung
Scotchman, alone, spent about £50 in answering telegrams to
his familyandfriends, so I understood. It was a miserablehouse­
hold, and it seemed to me impossible, under the circumstances,
toestablishanysort ofunity andto doanysort ofgoodwork.
And, as usual, it was the pin-pricks which, added to the hard
blows, seem
ed to make the situation almost intolerable.
HYGIENE
I t was my planto live most simply, in order that the members of
our little group should acquire sane, evenly balanced tempera­
ments. I proposed to have only two meals a day, breakfast at
nine o’clock and dinner at five o’clock. In summer at eight and
half-past four. I advised very little meat; for those who were
at all excitable, or unable to sleep profoundly, no tea or coffee,
and no tobacco for anyone. Wine was to be used only in great
moderation, for those who were thin-blooded and to whom it
might be of service medicinally. The strong and full-blooded,
especially the young men of this habit, were better without it,
as a rule, I thought, and would find the struggle to live a per­
fectlypure life made easier by suchabstinence. In short, purityof
life was to be placed as the central endeavour. Whatever helped
this effort was to be accepted, whatever hindered it was to be
abandoned, and each was asked to determine for himself or
herself, through an honest inward searching, how this self-
controlwasbest ensured. Withsome, wine mightincreasetempta­
tion, with others not. I desired the clothing to be pretty andwell
cut, for it is our duty to please the eyes of our neighbours,
obligedsometimes to look at us many hours a day; but I wished
that it should be simple, modest, loose, and light. I suggested
that we should retire to bed early, and that the manual labour
and mental work should be regular, and should alternate,
profitably,beingwelltimed. Idesiredtoencouragemusic, dancing,
happy holidays, and all sane pleasures, kept within legitimate
bounds, as my mother had kept themin New Harmony. There
was to be plenty of fresh air, day and night, in our rooms, and
regular out-of-door exercise.
I had followed this systemin my own life, and it had worked
exceedingly well. Simplicity, then, was to be the key-note, but
t at simplicity did not imply a disagreeable asceticism—quite
the contrary. No one was to dress in a slovenly, ugly fashion;
our home was not to be bare and cheerless; and that important
<

A bad cook is a poor servant of the Creator, for she mishandles

renders useless, in part, the human labour which brings the
edibles to her careless or clumsy hand. But a long, late dinner
ofmanycourses, especiallywhennot one ofthe dishesis perfectly
cooked, is, it seem
sto me, adoubtful benefit, andtoeat too often,
so that one has no keen appetite for any meal—this habit also
takes from, and does not add to, our enjoyment. Wherever we
try to grasp too much physical pleasure, we shall find at the end
thatweareableto own andto enjoyvery little.
I had first practised this simple, two-meal system at a well-
known Water Cure in New York State, and I had seen several
hundred patients improve wonderfully under it. On returning
hom
e, som
e of them to very hard work, such as farming, etc.,
theimprovement was maintained, so they wrote, under the same
m
anner of life.
Andnot only was it of use, physically, but above all it seemed
to give a moral balance to the character, for the body, when
neither over-fed, artificially stimulated, nor narcotized; when
neither cramped with tight clothing nor slothful, this sane body
becom
es the servant of the soul, and is not its master. Under
thissystemtherewas muchlessdanger ofbeingheavily depressed,
or unduly excited, without cause.
It had, then, been my intention gradually to help the little
group under my care to become normally healthy and happy,
enjoying the simple pleasures and duties of life, as children do.
This seem
ed to me especially necessary for the two or three
m
em
bers ofthe group belonging to the Harris remnant, who had
nearrelatives inthe InsaneAsylum, and were themselves inclined
to be nervous and moody.
But it was precisely with these persons, whom I had found
dom
iciledat Haifa, that trouble arose.
I found they were eating rather heavy breakfasts, luncheons,
aternooxi tea, andlate dinners, at which they appeared somewhat
elaborately dressed. After dinner they wished to spend a long
eveninginaclose room, overheated by lamps. The next morning
ey were rather limp, sometimes laying a weight of depression
on the rest of us.
1 was the more concerned, because I found that the cook,

Ontheotherhand, althoughthesemembers rejectedthe socialism
which considers the welfare of a cook as carefully as it does the
welfare of the most honoured guest for whom she caters—
althoughtheythought such carefulness unnecessary—yet someof
themhad adoptedthe more questionable instincts of the socialis­
tic mind, ordainingthat “What is mine remains mine, but whatis
yours belongs to me.” I was familiar with reformers (?) of this
type, through past experiences. For instance, I missed on one
occasiontheornamentsfromthemantelpiece. WhenIaskedabout
them, one of our partysaid: “Oh, I wantedto sendsomepresents
home, andI thought you would not mindif I tookthem.”
On another occasion my niece’s cloak disappeared, and she
had no travelling cloak for her return journey; a member coolly
remarked that he had sent it to his wife. These depredations
increasedto suchanextentthat finally, while Iwas awayfor afew
days, a member packed up several boxes of valuable books and
dispatched themto his home. On the other hand, some of these
people were not ready to share any of their own belongings with
anyone.
I was remindedof our experiences after the breaking up ofthe
Community of my grandfather, Robert Owen:
On one occasion a man had borrowed a pony cart from m
y
father. H
e sent it home after many months, with the following
note:
Dear Mr. D ale Owen,
I have broken your cart, please have it mended as soon as
possible, and send it back to me as quickly as you can. I hope there
will be no delay, as I need it.
Yours etc.,
Another incident of the sam
e type is the following:
After the breaking up of the Owen Community, a system of
exchangeswas in vogue, when ready money was lacking. A m
an
who had belonged to the Community went to the village store
with an egg, which he wished to exchange for a darning-needle.
SOCIALISM 95
When hehadreceived the needle he remarked that he would like
tobe“treated,”i.e. tobegivenadrinkofwhisky. Afterexamining
the liquor for a few moments, he suggested that he always liked
anegg in his whisky. The store-keeper broke the egg he had
received fromthe trader, and put it in the glass. It turned out to
be an egg with a double yolk, and the trader remarked that he
thought he ought to have two darning-needles, seeing that the
eggwas double-yolked. The store-keeper, much amused, handed
him two needles, and, after drinking his whisky and egg, he
departedintriumph.
This sam
e spirit possessed some of the members of our little
group, but others, I amglad to say, and among themthe young
Scotchman I have mentioned, were most generously willing to
helpothers.
I reasoned with the lady who had been in charge of the house
beforemy arrival, andexplained to her that I wishedto have only
two simple meals, breakfast at nine o’clock in the morning and
dinnerat five o clockinthe afternoon, because, duringlongyears
ofpractice, I had found various advantages in this system:
It divided the day well, for one could rise early, set the house
in order, and organize the ménage generally before breakfast.
Thebreakfasthour servedasatimeofrest followingone’smanual
labours, and after breakfast there was a long, uninterrupted
stretchoftimeuntil dinner, wherein one couldfollowone’svoca­
tion music, painting, writing, gardening, carpentering, sewing,
etc. The evening began early, and hence ended early.
And, above all, the servants were not drudges. There was no
hurry after breakfast to set the house in order and prepare a
m
idday meal; and their evenings were free as soon as the five
0 clock dinner had been cleared away.
Afterwards, when I inaugurated this system, my cook said to
m
e: Ah, howthankful I am. When the servants in other houses
are half dead, hanging over a hot stove, I amwalking about in
the beautiful garden in a cool muslin dress.”
At this time, however, there was violent opposition from the
lady in question, whom I shall call Edith. I compromised the
matter by arranging to have three meals, although experience
bad taught me that the third meal was not necessary for the
majority of people. But I stipulated, if I yielded this point, that
1 'Lrur^mea^was to be a very simple one, with no cooking.
This system was carried out for a day or two, and then, to
MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
96
my surprise, I foundthe lady andher husbandeatinganelaborate
dinner at one end of the table, while our simple meal was set at
the other. I could scarcely blame her for this, as she was only
following alifelong habit.
But when I went into the kitchen, I found that the cook was
much disturbed at the order which the lady had given her, as
this double style ofmeal was even more trying thanhadbeenthe
former dinner of several courses prepared for the whole family.
In addition to these troubles, I found that the agent Laurence
had left in charge, a clergyman, had squandered a great deal of
money, andathousand pounds whichI had expectedto findand
uponwhichIhadcountedinmakingmyplans, hadvanishedinto
thin air. Money troubles were, then, added to my other cares.
For three or four weeks after our arrival, letters andtelegrams
continuedto pour inuponus. One or two members hadleft, and
those who remained went about the house in moody silence.
One morning the young Scotchman, who had been a comfort
andsupport to me duringthese straining days, saidto me:
“I cannot standthis anylonger. Have you any objection to m
y
goingto Dalieh, your houseonMount Carmel, where I canspend
afew quiet days in order to determine what I ought to do?”
“Ithinkit agoodplan,” I replied.
On his return fromDalieh he told me he thought he ought to
return to Scotland for his mother’s sake, as she had fallen ill.
I bade himGod-speed, but although he left our home he has
always remained our faithful friend; and, later, I should almost
have starved had he not generously helped me more than once.
I amvery grateful to this friend of ours, who remainedtrue to us
undervery tryingcircumstances. Inafter years hedevotedhimself
more and more unselfishly to the service of his fellow-creatures,
and to the day of his death he retained my admiring esteem
,
although I did not see eye to eye with him concerning certain
doctrines he held, belonging to “new-thought” religion.
ENGLAND
At the end of the month I decided that it was best I should return
to England; for it seemed to me that there ought to be some way
of calming an angry excitement raging, not among reprobates, but
among kindly, sensible people, when there was almost no reason
for its existence. Laurence had made an error in judgment, through
too great a faith in the self-control of others, because he himself
had learnt a remarkable self-control. I thought it even possible
that, at one time, his mind may have revolved too constantly,
and hence to a certain extent morbidly, around the sex question;
but if so, the cause of this temporary lack of balance was not
self-indulgence, but so phenomenal a self-restraint that few men
would undertake to practise it.
Thisbeingthebeginningandthe end ofthewholematter, over
which so violent a stormhad been raging, it seemed to me there
ought to be some way of calming it. It so happened that I had
written two or three letters, both before and after our marriage,
inanswer to the question as to whether the sympneumatic influx
—as Laurence had named the Power upholding us—should be
given by one person to another through physical touch. I had
answered these letters saying that both Laurence and I thought
it m
uch wiser to transmit a spiritual force only by spiritual
m
eans,exceptwhenthepersons werebetrothedorlegallymarried,
and lovers’ caresses were legitimate. Laurence had entirely ac­
cepted this view with, as he said, “great relief” after our talk
onthevoyage.
Ihopedthat Ishouldbe ableto get hold oftheseletters, adding
to themawarmletter of congratulation from the relative whom
Jenniehadsaidconsidered me awickedwoman—amissivewhich
hadbeensent to meafter we hadleft America, where this relative
adlast seen us. Hence, she could not have reasonably changed
er mind without any ground for such a change. The only new
feature since that time had been Jennie’s accusations.
When I reached England I went to the house in Richmond,
w ere I had been before leaving England, kindly urged to do so
by the members of the family living with us at Haifa, who had
written to their English home that I was returning. Laurence
G
98 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
had been a benefactor to these people, taking a great deal of
trouble over a highly strung son of the family, who might have
become, like his brother, an inmate of an asylum. H
e had taken
himinto his home and had succeeded well with him. The father
akindly, well-bredman, was grateful to him. My presencewasin
no wise inconvenient, as they were well-to-do people, living in a
spacious home, tended by a retinue of servants.
On landing, I telegraphed that I had reached England, and
wouldarriveatthehouseabouteleveno’clockatnight. Mytrunks
were carriedin and the carriage dismissed. A servant showed m
e
to my room, and afew moments later the sister of the master of
the house joined me. She told me that her brother had sent her
to saythat I couldnot remaininthe house, but must leave imme­
diately.
“That is impossible,” I said, “it is nearly midnight, and the
carriagehas beendismissed. You have received your niece’sletter
from Haifa saying I was coming to you, and my telegram. Why,
then, did you not meet me at the door, before the carriage was
sent away?”
“Because I wish you to stay and see my brother,” she said,
kindly. I amsurehewill changehis mindas soon ashe sees you.
It would be a disgraceful thing to send Laurence Oliphant’s
widowout of thehousewherehehas done somuch good.”
I thankedher for her kindness, andsheleft me after giving m
e
several letters which awaited m
e.
One was from the young Scotchman, who had now reached
Scotland, telling me that my brother Julian, the father of Grace
andMargaret,wasonhis way to Haifa to fetch his childrenaway,
he (my brother) having been bombarded with letters and tele­
grams from Scotland.
A secondlettertoldmethatatJennie’sinstigationarrangements
were beingmade to arrest me, andput me in prison, as soon as I
reachedEngland.
-taidathird was aformal request fromarelative of Laurences,
asking me to make an appointment to meet himin London.
N
eedless to say, I did not sleep much that night, andhadnot
my aith in Jesus Christ poured its balm through my soul, it
would have been filled with gall and bitterness, for my trials
seemedto begrowingheavier than I could bear.
Only God knew how I had striven to be a good mother to
these children, who were to be taken away from me as though I
ENGLAND 99
hadpollutedthem. It seemedto me that nothingharder than this
couldever befall me; but I was mistaken, for fate hadablowyet
heavier in store for me.
I prayed without ceasing through the night, for I knew if
I let go of my Lord, even for a short moment, I should be lost.
Despair would seize m
e.
An unreasonable hatred of England tempted me, again and
again, and yet again; unreasonable because America had been as
cruel. But at last my sanity returned, and I knew that neither
England nor America was at fault, but the kingdom of hell.
Satan was my enemy, and again I perceived, illumined by my
Saviour, how great is his fiendish power—so great that there is
no salvation, save in the arms of Christ, for those whomthe evil
one bitterly persecutes.
So my self-pity was swallowed up in sympathy for the human
race, helpless in Satan’s grasp, unless Christ helps them, and
Christ seem
s hard to find sometimes. It had taken all my faith to
findH
imthatnight, andIfeltthat scarcelyahair’sbreadthdivided
the triumph of my renewal in Himfrom the dead failure which
threatened me. It was not for me, then, who had almost failed,
to judge and to condemn others. My plain duty was to ask for
guidance, and to walk as He told me. During the night a simple
little diagram, which I had sometimes used, was recalled to me,
which definitely fixed the fact in my mind that man, a small,
weak creature, cannot possibly resist Satan, a larger, stronger
creamre, unless he is aided by a largest, strongest Saviour, Jesus
Againandagainthesentence, “WithoutMeyecandonothing,”
repeated itself in my mind, and it took afi bitterness out of my
IOO MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
soul. I had no right to accuse others, when I knewmyselfto be
somiserablyweak. It is so difficult to bea true Christianthat one
loses all inclination to condemn those who fail sometimes to
findH
im
.
The next morning I rose early and made everything ready for
my departure. I then asked the servant to send for a carriage.
When it drove up, I saw from my window that it was sent
away again. I went down to the dining-room to ask why the
carriage had been dismissed, and there I found the master of
the house.
H
e advanced to meet me, begged me to remain for breakfast,
and saidhe would like to speak to me afterwards. We had atalk
after the morning meal, which ended by his cordially shaking
hands with me and beggingme to remain. He said he must have
been out of his mind to turn against me as he had done, but he
explainedthat he had been so inundated with letters accusingm
e
that at last they had taken effect. He repeatedly begged m
e not
to go andI finally consented to remain, he proving to bea most
kind host during my short stay in England.
A day or two later I went to London to fulfil my engagement
with Laurence’s relative, saying, as I hastily swallowed a cup
of cocoa—for I wished to catch an early train—that I should be
back, probably, for luncheon. I little knew how long and how
tryingadaylay beforem
e.
When I met Laurence’s relative at the railway station, he re­
ceived me with the cold look of distrust to which I was now
growing accustomed; and which, after the struggle of my first
night in England, no longer disturbed me seriously: I knew that
he was blinded, and I felt sorry for him.
But I was not prepared for the newform ofattack.
H
esought aquiet corner, andthen said abruptly:

InthecrowdI cameface to face with alady, accompanied by a
gentlemanIknew.
H
e introduced her to me. It was Jennie. “I wish to have an
interviewwith you,” she said; “where canwe meet?”
I considered a moment, and appointed a meeting in the home
of a physician I had known on a former visit to London, tele­
graphing to himthat we were coming, and at what time.
I found several persons in the room, and seated myself, after
saluting them, to await developments. They seemed to be in
consultation at the other end of the apartment, and I studied
Jennie’s face during the few moments I was kept waiting.
It was arevelation to me to find that her American verve, her
thin, intense American face, and even the intonations of her
American speech, appealed to me as though I had met a friend.
I, being also a highly strung American, understood how she
could suffer, and I was almost tempted to shake hands and to
say “Compatriot, I sympathize with you.” Even when sheturned
onm
ewithalook ofintenseantagonism, the feelingdidnot quite
die. Evidently there is such athing as anational bond.
In addition, I perceived that Jennie was a woman above the
ordinary; I realized that she had, in truth, sufferedintensely, and
that she had worked herself into the belief that she was in the
right. She was self-deceived rather than a deceiver, and so I for­
gave her, then and there, as there was much excuse for her.
But although all personal animosity died within me, my reso­
lution to defend Laurence became even more firmly fixed, and I
m
ade them understand, at once, that no power on earth would
inducemetobedisloyal to myhusband. Theycould dowhat they
pleased, fight me as they liked, and I should not stir from my
position. IreveredhimasIhadreverednoothermanIhadknown,
andthat reverence would last always.
Jennie began with a torrent of accusations, but presently the
physician checked her, and asked her to produce some evidence
besides her own unsupported word. “I understand,” he said,
that you have beenaccusingLaurence Oliphant for anumber of
weeks. You have had ample time, then, to find some corrobora­
tiveevidence. Will you begood enoughto produceit.”
She faltered under the calm English tone and mien of the
gnified man, who was acting, informally, as chairman.
gain I was surprised to find how sorry I felt for her, as her
t , nervous fingers were interlaced, and varied expressions
102 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
chased each other across her mobile face. It was like seeing
quivering flesh flung against a fine statue of justice. &
‘I will produce it, I will produce it, if you will give me time»
she said, with ahysterical risein her voice. ’
“Very well,” he said, “but until you have such evidence in
hand, plainlyproved, it is useless to take up your time or ours.”
I rose to go, and the young manwho had accompanied Jennie
suddenly confronted me with amenacinggesture, almost shaking

THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
Ihad barelytakenmy place at the dinner-table, when acard was
handed m
e from an officer of the Vigilance Committee, and the
servant said the gentleman awaited me in the drawing-room.
I hadhad nothing in the last twenty-four hours but the cup of
cocoa I had swallowed at breakfast time, but I pushed back my
plate feeling that I could not eat. I went to my room before
goingtothe drawing-roomin order to collect my senses. I found
myself speculating as to whether they would allow me to write
m
ybookinprison, andthinkingit would be a quiet, undisturbed
sort ofplacein which to work.
I also arranged in my mind which trunk I should take, for I
supposedtheyallowedyouto have some baggageinprison.
As I wandered about, I met my own image, face to face in a
full-length mirror, and scanned the reflection as though it were
astranger.
My grey hair was drawn back, simply, from my face, which
had lost its usual colour and was thin and pale. My slender
fram
e looked taller than usual in the long, straight, loose black
gown which I wore, unadorned by any ornament or trimming.
The struggle and the victory of the last few days had left their
im
press on my features. It was a calm face which looked at-m
e,
andasIgaaedatit withasmile, Hispeaceilluminedit. I knelt for
a moment by my bed to ask Christ to help me, and then went
tothe drawing-room.
I found there a dignified gentleman, with a shapely contour of
head and a keen, clever expression. He scanned me closely, for
amoment,asIadvancedtowards him; andthenalook ofsurprise
swept across his features. Evidently I was not the sort of person
neexpectedto see.
H
e courteously placed a chair for me, and, after a few intro-
ductorywords, statedthe reasonofhis coming:
I supposeyou know, Mrs. Oliphant, that certain charges have
them?”3 Ca^a*

ed’ andyaitedf°r himto proceed. After afewmoments’

prising fashion. ur"
H
erepeatedall thedoctrinesIwassupposedtoholdconcerning

with me, and would like to consult me on the question. H
e also
insisted on my taking his hand, as he had understood I could
transmit some occult power byphysical touch, andhe would like
to have someexperience ofit.
I saw at once the trap he was setting for me, and told him that
he held such dangerous doctrines, I must warn him that he was
on perilous ground and advised him to reconsider his position
I said that I quite refused to touch his hand under these circur^
s ances, as I thought he was decidedly in the wrong. My sense of

I HAD written for the letters I wished to use as evidence, before
leaving Haifa, letters wherein I had advised, in Laurence’s name
and my own, that a spiritual life should be spiritually conveyed
through prayer and not by physical touch, and I had brought
with me the letter of congratulation on my marriage from my
relative, who condemned me, so Jennie affirmed. The only
warning contained in this letter was the hope that I would not
grow conceited, because I had married a noted man; and such a
warning certainly did not imply any criticismof Laurence.
Apartfromthis sentence, there was onlyheartygoodwill, sent
asI have said, after she had seen Laurence andmyselffor the last
time; and hence there could have been no valid reason for an
antagonismto me, save Jennie’sinfluence.
Happily, the receivers of my letters concerning the sympneu-
matic influx had kept them, and sent them back to me a few days
after my arrival. Therefore, I was now in possession of the evi­
denceI wished to use.
During these days of waiting, I received aletter from Scotland
saying t at if I did not acknowledge Laurence’s guilt, and con­
sent to suppress his books, the writer intended to fill the news-
papers throughout the United Kingdom with denunciations of
us both. H
e was a rich young man, as were all my adversaries,
and he possessed a considerable influence in his own sphere,
the commercial one; hence it seemed probable that he might
beable to injure us seriously. He gave me four days in which to
decide. I wrote by return of post that he could take any course

When I had scheduled the letters I had received, I took som
e
large sheets of paper, drew a line down the middle, and pro­
ceeded to put the accusations contained in the various missives
and m
essages which had been sent to us on the one side, and
quotations frommy letters on the other. After having drawn up
this document, I addedthat I hadtheletters with mein England
and would showthe originals to any of my accusers who wished
to see them. I think the evidence in our favour would have held
good in any Court of Law.
The only answer to this document was a message saying that
thosewhohadaccusedmewouldknowhowto defendthemselves
if I sued them for slander. I had not the slightest intention of
doing so, nor even the wish to judge harshly, in so puzzling a
combination of circumstances. But the message gave me satis­
faction, for it indicatedthat myproved statement hadmade som
e
impression.
I then offered to meet my accusers under any conditions they
choseto impose, andto answer any questions they wished to put
to m
e. I made only one reservation. The marriage compact
between Laurence and myself and between Laurence and Alice
concerned no one but ourselves. With regard to our bond and
theirs I permitted no questions. I believed that His ministering
angels blessed these unions, and I could not suffer them to be
discussedbyhis enem
ies andmine, possibly in an unsympathetic,
and, it may be, ascornfullyincredulous manner.

true nature, and as she turned to me, and stretched out both her
hands, saying, “You needn’t send me away, Aunt Rose, for
absolutely I will not budge from here,” I realized that I had no
truer, more steadfast friendin the world thanthis gentle, graceful
girl. Shehadalways seemedlikeaflower, swayedbyeverypassing
breeze, but her flexibility was nowproved to be, not aweakness
but astrength. Although I had known her fromthe time she w
as*
three hours old, I was myself astonished to see that the powers
of evil had, in her, encountered a rock. Many others Satan had
been able to turn against me, but this child had been faithful
throughout, although she had now heard the whole miserable
story of the attack upon me.
Whenthe nurse hadput her in my arms a new-born baby, she
had opened her great blue eyes and looked straight at me. I felt
then and there, that we answered one another, spirit to spirit’
andmy impassion was correct; for in my hour of need, she, the
Court jester, as she called herself, was willing to stand by m

A h , how happy we were. The discordant elements were elimi­
nated, andwe three, Murray, Grace, andmyself,thanked God for
the sphere of peace which now enveloped us. Murray worked at
his painting and music, Grace at her music and sewing, andI on
my book, alternating our mental work with physical exercise
We established the simple, two-meal system, which my nieces
and myself had always followed, and Murray accepted it with
pleasure. It suited him as well as it suited us. The servants had
plenty of leisure, and were happy and grateful.
This was the atmosphere I had hoped to create for the sixteen
original members of our little group, fitting each into his or her
congenial occupation. But it was not to be, only we three had
survived the debacle. Yet we three appeared to be a multitude
for we seemed to have ahappiness which would suffice for three
hundred. I think even Laurence and Alice in heaven must have
enjoyed making a little visit to their old home sometimes.
Murray had fully recovered from the strain through whichhe
hadpassed, and looked healthier and handsomer than I had ever
seenhim.
H
e had received a telegram from Jennie as soon as he had
written to his family, and they knew where he was domiciled.
1nis telegramread:

It had disturbed Murray a good deal, but I suggested to him
at it seemed a little too melodramatic to be perfectly genuine.
The sequel proved that this was the case, for instead of dying
Jennie married, not long after, the rich young man, afine young
tellow, who accompanied her the day I met themin the London
station, and led a very comfortable existence. So Murray’s mind
wasatrest.

pproachedher. She was agood musician, and their mutual love

“Oh, Auntie, we aresohappy, we three, all byourselves, please

sawhow thin I grew at first; it was because this girl suckedthe
life out of me. You don t want to encourage cannibalism
doyou? ’
“I don’t think, honey, we ought to refuse when she says she
issorry, doyou?”
“I supposenot. Well I must resign myselfto beingeatenup, a

womenwho serve them, and set us both laughing. &
This lady, who was settled at Dalieh, came to visit us two or
three times a week, often staying through the day and night.
She wished us to treat her as a guest during her frequent visits,
andto leave our daily work in order to entertain her, not always
an easy task. The larger share of it fell to Grace, as they were
about the same age, and both young married women. Hence
our guest sought her society most frequently.
Oneafternoon, after she hadleft us to return to Dalieh I went
to Grace’s room, and found her in bed. She was pale, and there
weredarkrings under her eyes.
“Are you ill, dear child?” I said

Grace, I said, “you are a dear girl.”
As time went on, Iplainly sawthat this ladydidexhaust Grace

Finally, I said to her: “Dear child, I cannot let you suffer like

After this visit Grace was not nearly so tired, and the visitor

MURRAY’S FAMILY
W h e n we had been at Haifa about two and a half months
Murraycam
etomeonemorning, andsaid: 5
“Rosamond, I have been having something of a struggle.
It seem
s to me that I ought to return to Scotland and make one
last effort to persuade my father and relatives that they are
m
istaken. I must own that I have little hope of success; still
myconscience will be at ease, when I have done my utmost. T

stormseem
s to have died down now, and it is possible, although
notprobable, that they will listen to me.
“I hate to leave here. We are so happy, happier than I have
ever beenduring my whole life. He has given us His Peace. But
I m
ust not neglect my duty to my people, whom I dearly love,
andalsoI must go somewhere where I can make a living. What
doyouthinkabout it?”
I asked him to let me prayerfully consider the question for a
little tim
e.
The next evening Murray, Grace, and myself, discussed the
m
atter.
“Grace cannot remain her indefinitely,” I said, “because her
husband has the first claim upon her. When she leaves, you and
I cannot very well remain here by ourselves, Murray; it would,
1 fear, give rise to some gossip, especially in this strict German
colony; and, as you say, there is no remunerative work here for
you Had all gone smoothly, you would have been fully and most
usefuily occupied in painting, but the whole situation has now

“Yes,” I said, “it seem
s to me that you ought to go to him
.
Ifhewillnotlisten, your consciencewill beatrest, for you cando
no more. We shall thenaskfor guidance as to what the next step
must be.” F
“Now, Murray,” said Grace, “don’t put on seven-leagued
boots early to-morrow morning, to get to Scotland in too big
a hurry, for you know your legs are long enough without them.
Go sckwei, schwei—slowly, slowly, as the Arabs say, andgive usa
little longer time to breathe. Must a person be pulled up by the
roots themomentheisproperlyplanted?”
“You know, Grace, that I could stay here for ever, if God
permittedit, butmyconscienceseem
stosaytomethatImustgo.”
“And my conscience says the same thing,” said Grace, rue­
fully. “I have been pulling the bedclothes over my ears every
night, so that I wouldn’t hear it. But there it is. Beingas it is
inside ofme,thereisnouseto stuffsomethinginmyearsfromthe
outside in order not to hear it. Disagreeable things, these con­
sciences! I wonder when they get aproper night’s sleep, for they
always seemtobewideawake, andpokingatyouto dosomething
you don’t want to do. Well, it seem
s our trio of consciences
chants in unison, ‘ Yallah,’ which is the Arabic for £
Be up and
doing,’ isn’t it?”
So it was arrangedthat Murray should leave by the next boat,
Grace andmyselfremainingat Haifa until we heard the result of
the visit. We would then return to Europe, and Grace, after
a short stay, intended to go back to America. My brother had
written methat, if I returned to Europe, he would be glad to
sendMargaret to me again, now that the storm had died down.
But hedidnot wishher to comeasfar asH
aifa.
In due course we heard from Murray, he giving us a detailed
account of his experiences. H
e wrote:
“When Ireachedmynative city, I found that mygrandmother
had died and was to be buried the next day. I made my way to
the house, and when I entered the room all my relatives backed
away from me as though I had been an evil apparition. No one
spoketom
e, or shookhandswithm
e. SoIstood, asolitaryfigure,
during the ceremony, and although the occasion was a solemn
one, and it was a sorrow to me that I should never see my dear
oldgrannie again—still I couldnot helpsmilingat thethought of
her astonishment when, in that other world, the truth becam
e
clear to her. When she perceived how I have striven to lead a
MURRAY’S FAMILY i i j
purelife, itwouldseemstrangetoherto seethateveryman’shand
appeared to be against me, because they believed precisely the
opposite of the truth. I think we must receive some severe
shocks when, fromthe vantage ground of heaven, we seethings
astheyare.
“Later, when the will was read, I found that she had disin­
heritedme, as I expected.
“Iwrote to my father as soon as I reached Scotland, asking for
an interview. H
e received me a day or two after my arrival.
I am deeply grieved to tell you, Rosamond, that there was no
reconciliation.
“Again he repeated that he would rather see me lying deadin
mycoffinthanto know I was associated with you, andfaithfulto
Laurence. H
e said that if I came to him in a contrite spirit con­
fessing my sins, and promising to denounce Laurence to all
concerned, and gave himmy word never to see you again, he
wouldreceive me ashis son. Ifnot, we must separate.
“I was cut to the heart, but thank God, I still love my father,
more than before, perhaps, for I feel that I have grieved him
sorely. Ifelt that he was sincere and believed me to be in danger
ofgoingastray morally.
“After this interview I returned to the hotel where I was
stayingand went to bed. There was a violent wind storm, and a
severeneuralgia seizedme, whichwas almost arelief, for thepain
inmyfacewassostrongthatitdistractedmymind, tosomeextent,
from my mental trouble, and of the two the physical suffering
was m
uchthe easier to bear. So it proved to be agodsend.
“Duringourinterviewmyfather seemedto bevery angrywith
m
e. H
is face rose before me, again and again, during the night,
until Ifelt very desolate. I was lying here, in ahotel in my native
city, where I had so striven to help my fellow-creatures, and I
seem
ed to have not one friend left. But at last prayer brought
m
eits blessedbalm, and towards morningI fell asleep, in spiteof
the throbbing pain in my face. I was awakened by a newsboy’s
cry: ‘Factory blown down, havoc of the storm.’
Iroseanddressedhastily, in order to get apaper, andI found
thatmyfather’sfactoryhadbeenseverelydamaged.”
Murrayleft Scotland without delay, as therewas nothingmore
to be done, and went to Paris. Here he established himself in a
cabm
anshotel at two and a half francs per day. I found after­
wards that he had had no fire during the bitter winter, as he was
n6 MY PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTINE
husbanding his slender resources, andhe worked at his painting,
in bed, to keep warm. Hehad, in consequence, asevere attack of
influenza, whichleft himwith aweakheart for ayear or two. H
e
was working at apicture of Christ in Gethsemane, which he had
begunafter avisit to Jerusalem, andhe was anxious to finishthis
work before looking for anyemployment.
So while Jennie was luxuriating in her handsome home,
Murray was struggling with poverty. But neither in his frequent
letters, nor afterwards, when we sawhim, did he utter one com­
plaint. Throughouthis trial his serenesoul remainedundisturbed.
I did not know, until we joined himin Paris, how he had been
suffering; andit was only after repeated questioning, seeinghow
paleandthin helooked, that he toldme howhard his winter had
been.
We had not been able to join him sooner, because I was
detainedin Haifalonger thanI hadexpected to be, through som
e
legal formalities I was obliged to settle; and hence we were not
free to leave until the winter was well advanced.
During this time of waiting a quiet period was enjoyed by
Grace and myself, left tête-à-tête in Haifa; a period full of sweet
care-free contentment, which would have been disturbed h
ad
*
we known how Murray was struggling with illness, and almost
with want; for he felt it his duty to save every possible penny of
the small sumleft to him, in order not to burden anyone, while
he finished the picture which absorbed all his attention. H
is
letters were always cheerful, breathing no word of his trials.
STORY OF MY LIFE {continued)
I will resume, in this quiet interval, the story of my life, inter­
rupted when Laurence and I left the ship on reaching England,
astheevents which now followed cannot be quite clearly under­
stood, unlessI take upthis thread.
M
ayI, ere proceeding, introduce to the reader what, for lack
ofabetterterm, Icall my “Voice.”
In the second chapter of The Mediators, the book to which I
havedevotedthegreater part of my life, this Voice is spoken of,
and I will repeat concisely the description here.
TheVoicespeakswithin me, and yet it speaks to me. My outer
senses remain in action while it is teaching me, there being no
hypnoticinfluenceofanykind. I amawake, andin full possession
of my reasoning powers, so that I can consider the statements
oftheVoiceandeither accept or reject them, my will beingquite
uncoerced. My body is less in evidence than usual, and I feel a
slight deadening of my physical sight and hearing, as though
light fingers were pressed on my eyes and ears, in order to give
freerplayto myinner senses. That is all. The Voice explains how
itspeakstom
e, asfollows:
O
ne hears and sees because various waves impinge upon the
organs fittedto receive them. It is acknowledged by Science that
som
eofthesewaves are finer than others, and the claimmade by
theVoice is that there are varying organs fitted to receive these
varyingwaves, for it would be a waste of power to send waves
through the air and the ether with no object, and it would be
unwise to condemn the finest, subtlest waves fitted to be most
effective,tobecomeleasteffective, because there arenofineorgans
related to them, andphysical organs are not in touch withthem.
Thusthe Voice claims that I hear its tones, because fine vibra­
tions are impinging on fine organs; namely, the organs of the
spiritual body, and it is suggested that this process takes place,
because God is economical and wise, wasting not one thrill in
t eairorthe ether, which can be made of use. Hence, conscious­
ness does not act only on the surface, but is diversified by planes
withinplanes, reachingevernearerto thedivine Centre, where the
utm
ost concentration is to be found.
i i 8 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
This, then, is the suggestion: Science says that there are manv
waves traversing space which are too fine to be of use to the
senses Whereas the Voice claims that a perfect economy dis­
tinguishes God s Scheme and hence that sentience need not waste
these swift vibrations, because subtle organs exist, within the
cruder ones which are in sympathy with these fine waves, when­
ever man chooses to use the senses of the spiritual body.
In this quickening and refinement of vibrations and organs
e progress is so gradual and regular, that it is difficult to define
w ere sensation ceases to be material and becomes spiritual.

When telling my story to Laurence, I had reached Cincinnati,
on my way to school, as the reader perhaps remembers.
I went to New York with my father, who decided to put me
underprivate tutors. I worked very hard, they piling on me longer
and longer tasks when they found I could accomplish them.
During my stay I had my third experience of evil.
I had been shopping in Broadway, and found, on nearing our
house, that I had left in a shop, some distance away, a handsome
parasol with a carved ivory handle, given me by a friend.
I retraced my steps, found the place on Broadway, recovered
my parasol, and started on my way back. It was summer time,
and still daylight, although rather late; and I found that a stream
of men were making their way up town from their places of
business. There were comparatively few women to be seen. I
had, as a girl, very brilliant colouring, sunny brown hair, grey-
blue eyes, and very red cheeks, which, at times, almost looked
as though they were painted. I observed, presently, that many
men were staring at me very rudely, and some o f them approached
me with familiar gestures. Only a few passed me by indifferently,
the majority gazing at me with a look which made my blood
boil. I felt that my eyes were blazing with anger and my cheeks
growing scarlet, the consequence being that I attracted more
and more attention as the crowd thickened. I hailed an omnibus,
ut when I entered I found it was filled with men, whose manners
were even more objectionable than those on the street. The man

Several boxes of books, half unpacked, had been littering the
front passage for a week or two, books which were to be placed
on the top shelves of a high closet. The volumes were heavy
ones, and I knew the task was beyond my failing strength; but
after waiting in vain for someone else to attend to them, I carried
them up a ladder and put them where they belonged.
Suddenly, after I had been working for some time, as there
were many books, my strength gave way. I fell backward, loaded
with heavy volumes, and struck a sharp nail on an opposite wall,
which dug precisely into the spot I had strained through my
energetic sweeping. I was badly hurt; an ominous coldness took
possession of that side of my body, there seeming to be a ring
of ice around my ankle, and my semi-paralysed hand held a
pen with difficulty. My eyesight began to fail, until I could not
see to read, write, or sew, and my back was so weak I could take
very little exercise.
I was sent to a celebrated German doctor and to a well-known
oculist. The former examined me and told me I was bound to be
paralysed eventually, because I had inflicted a fatal injury on
an important ligament, and that all women suffering in a like
manner were made, without exception, helpless for life.
He was an eccentric little man, with a rough manner but a
very kind heart. He was so overrun with work that he had
hidden himself in a small village; but even here he had his hands
very full, and one had to arrange for an interview five or six
weeks beforehand.
When this great authority pronounced this crushing verdict,
I said to him:
“ Herr Doctor Ludwig Friedrich Siissmilch von Hornig” —
for that was his name—“ I do not intend to be paralysed. I have
too much to do, and God did not create me in order to inflict on
me a living death.”
“ You talk nonsense, my little lady. It is not God, but Nature
who is Master. When your hand is cut off you have no fingers,
and it is quite as certain that when one is injured as you are,
one must always be paralysed. Indeed, I do not understand how
you still walk; a woman in your condition has just been carried
out on a stretcher, and she will never walk no more.” He had
grown very red, and spoke with the strong accent he had when
excited. I tell you that you must be paralysed, do you hear
me?”

being almost a miracle. He was a manly, upright, lovable man,
and when he returned, on leave, for a short time, I had accepted

She and her husband had lived near us, and on the day of her

was breaking, and my poor, weak body, worn with fatigue
could endure no more. As I stood at the gate leading into our
garden, it seemed to me that I should die

What had I done to be cursed like this? How, paralysed and blind
was I to exist without my mother? And how -the thought caSe
to me as a crushing blow—how was I to live all my lift, with a
man of whom I weaned in an hour? ^
My mother was gone who had filled my every need; and the
lover was left, whose influence had begun to turn even my dreams
into nightmares. The thought of our union was coming ,o be a
dread which darkened all my life, until there seemed fo be no
care-free pleasantness anywhere. Had he been a bad man, the
STO RY OF M Y LIFE 125
matter would have been simple; but he was a man of whom many
women would have been justly proud—good, handsome, prac­
tically clever; why, then, did he bore me so that I dreaded to
hear his knock at the door?
For many months I had felt like a chained creature, his simple
integrity seeming to forge the last unbreakable link. I had no
reason to send him away, for he was a man far above the average.
As these bitter thoughts surged through me, I clung to the
railing for support, and looked up at the dark and silent house,
where I should never again see the beloved face of my mother.
How could I bear it all?
It was a crucial moment; the courage, strengthened through
my mother’s long, wise training, which had so long sustained
me, was swept away like stubble; human strength was gone.
Again and again, through these long, long months of suffering,
had I struggled to resist the despairing grief which threatened to
engulf me; and the incessant effort to overcome wearing mono­
tony and ceaseless pain now seemed to make my defeat the more
complete. I could do no more, I could only send a helpless cry
to my Maker, in my extremity.
And He heard me, at once, for my need was urgent. He spoke
to me, and His divine spark in my soul sprang into life and
answered Him, proclaiming His Power. I was immortal, and I
knew it; knew that neither disease nor sorrow can conquer His
unconquerable children. We were born of Him, and if we choose,
our Spirits need never taste death.
I lifted my eyes to adore Him, and I saw that the trees, grown
indistinct in the gloaming, were illumined by a soft light. As
I gazed, awe-struck, a radiant Form was outlined. Whereas I had
been desolate, I was now enveloped in a Love so benignant that
it seemed I could never again be a forlorn wanderer, for His
Mercy reached to the ends of space. Then I saw my mother and
my sister Anna. Their faces had been drawn with agony in their
last days; now a perfect peace illumined them. They both
smiled at me.
Some Power seemed to carry me into our home, where I found
no one, my father and brother not having returned from the
village. But as I lay on the couch in the dark room, with my
physical frame out-wearied, my whole soul thanked God, until,
at last, streams of strength poured through me, body as well as
soul.

It would seem that God lifts us to some high place, and then
permits us to be dropped back into the dark, deep valley in
order that we may climb, step by step, to the summits we have
seen and so earn the right of possession. When our eyes are
uplifted, the prophetic heights help us onward. But when they
perceive only the long, rough path before us, t h e t d i . 2
pinnacles of aspiration seem only to make the ascent harder.

unendurable; and the contrast between m / c x a l t a S ^ d my
foil seemed as a mockery, invented by some evil spirit to torment
me instead of a wholesome incentive permitted by our wise God.
So I struggled on, vibrating, as most of us do, between the
triumphant faith that claims all divine things, and the weak fear
that again loses them.
Shortly after my mother’s death, I had gone to make a visit
in a neighbouring town. There I met an interesting, intelligent
young man, who called frequently at the house I was v i S

new terror. Were I to meet, after I had married him a man after
my own heart, how dreadful it would be both for m ^good
husband and myself I was not at all tempted to care for the young
man I had expected to find at the door, he was only a pLsinf

A month or two later, my father, who was now domiciled in
Boston, sent for me to join him, and when I decided to go my
love- was much distressed, for he had hoped that our mtriage
would soon take place.
127
STO RY OF M Y LIFE
My father consulted several eminent physicians after I reached
Boston, but none of them could help me, I was growing ever
worse. I could not use my eyes at all and could scarcely take any
exercise, so my days seemed endless, shut in my room in the
boarding-house, where we were staying. My devoted father did
all that he could to make my lot more endurable. He took me to
one or two dinner-parties, the table being filled with the dis­
tinguished men and women of talent then living in Boston
and Cambridge; among these celebrities I most admired Mr.
Longfellow.
But the fatigue was too much for my slender strength, and my
eyes could not endure the light. So I begged him to go without
me, as it made me unhappy to see him cut off from the circle to
which he belonged and where he was so well loved.
As I grew feebler, he often carried me upstairs, although he was
nearing seventy. But he said that he scarcely knew he had a body,
it was so free from aches and pains. So he, at seventy, was fitted
thoroughly to enjoy his life; while I, at twenty-five, was a wreck,
and a wreck because two good women had neglected their
homely duties, through a great zeal for Church services, leaving
me to do harder manual work than I had the strength to endure.
After I had been in Boston some time, I heard of a very cele­
brated medium, and decided to go to her and to see whether I
could get any light through her as to where my duty lay with
regard to Dr. A., my lover.
It is not a course I should have taken at a later period. I should
have asked our Lord Jesus Christ to guide me, but my faith at
that time was still in a somewhat chaotic state, for I believed in
God but rejected my Saviour, and so I went to this medium.
I wrote on a piece of paper: “ Must I marry Dr. A. ?” and
put it in my pocket.
The medium was a pale, neurotic-looking woman, whose
strained expression in no wise resembled the peace which rests
on the face of a more normal believer. But she was a sympathetic,
and, so it seemed to me, an honest person.
It is certain that the trance into which she fell, a few moments
after we were seated in her private room, was not simulated.
She turned an almost ghastly green, and looked so deathlike,
that I was frightened. Presently she began to speak in a low,
strange voice, not at all like her own.
“ Your mother is here,” she said, “ and she wishes me to tell

had no memory of the message she had given me ^
repeated the prophecy to my father and some friends at the
STO RY OF M Y LIFE 129
house where we were lodging, but, of course, I did not write
it home.
I had explained to my father my feeling about Dr. A., and it had
seemed to him that, under these circumstances, I ought not to
marry him, especially as my health was ever growing worse.
My father’s advice had strongly influenced me, and the medium’s
message seemed to add the determining feather’s weight.
I wrote, therefore, to Dr. A., telling him that I thought it
right to break our engagement. His answer troubled me deeply,
for he said that he would never marry anyone else; I was the
one woman in the world for him.
I never saw him again, for he left New Harmony and settled
in the Far West. A friend of mine met him years afterwards,
and he was still unmarried. He said his abundant hair was quite
grey, but he was even handsomer and more refined-looking
as a middle-aged man than when young. He was very successful
in his profession, so the friend said.
When I meet this faithful lover of mine in heaven, I trust we
shall be the best of friends, but I was not meant to marry him,
for I could not have made him happy throughout the long years
of wedded life, when I was not able to love him. It is too great
a risk to marry a man one feels to be an alien, intellectually.
In the days which followed, I felt that a depression I could not
resist was taking possession of me.
A gentleman friend in the hotel asked me to go and hear a
light opera, which was having a great success. He said he would
engage a box, take me in a carriage, and bring me away at once
if I became fatigued. I had refused many invitations as my eyes
could not bear the light, but I felt as though I must have some
change, so I went. My eyes and spine pained me cruelly afterwards,
yet the evening did me a world of good. The bright tunes and
gay scenes, with no touch of coarseness, brought me out of the
morbid despondency against which I had been struggling. God
has many ways of helping His sorely tried children, and among
these means a pretty and refined fight opera is not to be despised,
for it reminded me that the end of living is not sorrow, but joy.
So my gay spirits revived and my spiritual feet danced, even
though my physical ones still had to be wearily dragged along.
I knew it was only my morbid fancy which had draped the whole
world in mourning.

13 ° M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PALESTIN E
Are not the more solemn preachers prone to undervalue the
useful mission of these dancing and singing children of God?
Indeed, are not they themselves tempted to forget how much
good they may do, when they do not bemean their art?
We are to meet Him in the air—wings are necessary in order
to reach the heights of Heaven, how then can we find Him
through a heavy solemnity ? If prosy' sermons bore us, who are
accustomed to boredom, do they please God, who is infinit y
varied, intensely living?
Among all the lies that Satan has invented, one of the most
mischievous is that an irksome dullness is the fittest expression
of religion. A droning voice, a wearying length of monotonous
speech, a heavy manner, a ponderous tread—these attributes
which are supposed to be the signs of piety, cannot be divine;
or they are in widest possible contrast to the instant flexibility
of an archangel, sweeping from one end of the Cosmos to the
other with a single magnificent stroke of powerful wings.
nly a few simple truths need to be remembered to make the
theatre an unmitigated blessing, and these truths are so plain that
it would seem scarcely worth while to recall them, were it not
that they are so often forgotten.
We realize, in the material world, that when brightness is
besmirched it is no longer bright.
We realize, in the material world, that a dirty man or woman is
not tunny because of his or her disgusting filth.
We realize, in the material world, that sores and plague-spots
are not agreeable. r ° r
We realize, in the material world, that wholesome food is to
be preferred to garbage.
Then why should we believe that in the theatrical world
brilliancy besmirched is more brilliant; that a mentally dirty
man is a funny man; that he who spreads moral plague-spots is
the better actor; and that he who offers us an unclean artistic
diet proves thereby that he is a master in his profession? In the
mental world, as in the physical, do not sane-minded men and
women prefer brightness and cleanliness?
It is self-evident that they must prefer attributes which are so
p amly preferable then why do some theatrical managers still
believe that a coarse under-current, a half-veiled vulgarity,
draws better than a perfectly clean morality?
For the simple reason that morality and boredom are supposed
STO RY OF M Y LIFE 131
to be synonyms; whereas the truth is that a dancer seeking God’s
ether can dance entrancingly; that a comedian listening to divine
laughter can act delightfully; that a singer hearing His harmonies
—aye, when they are only merry waltzes and not chorals—can
sing celestially.
When God is set in the theatre, no theatre-goer will ever again
be bored or deteriorated. _ _ .
This truth I realized on the night in question, for the dear little
opera—where the roles were taken by very young actors, still
filled with the innocent joy of living—this bright comedy did
me a world of good, of wholesome, lasting good.
It is true that the Church, and not the theatre, gave to me, in
the end, the enduring support which has never failed me, but
this fact need not prevent the deep gratitude which I feel for the
help the theatre has been, and still is, to me. The Church and t e
theatre are not inherently antagonistic, but quite the^ contrary,
as was clearly impressed upon me, later, when Wagner s Parsifal,
at Beyrouth, proved to be one of the most uplifting influences
of my life, the first golden notes of the hidden orchestra carrying
me'straight to my God.
ANO TH ER EX PERIEN C E OF EV IL
As my health did not improve in Boston, my anxious father sent
me to a lady physician in New York. I lodged in a house which
was a busy beehive of strenuous girl students, I being the only
idle person in the establishment.
I spent the long, hot days alone in my room with nothing that
I could do from morning until night except to take two or three
short walks in the dusty square in front of the house, each step
of which was pain; not a word could I read, not a line could I
write, not a note could I play, not a stitch could I take, without
adding to my suffering and bringing the day nearer when I
would be, so I increasingly feared, wholly paralysed and quite
blind.
The only occupation I had was to practice, with closed eyes,
the art of feeling my way and finding my belongings, without
seeing, in order to be prepared for the fatal day when I should
quite lose my sight.
When this monotony, following long years of monotony, was
growing almost unbearable, I heard that the celebrated conductor,
Theodore Thomas, was giving open-air concerts nightly, not
far away, and I longed to go to them.
The matron of the establishment was too busy to accompany
me, but I arranged to go with one of the young lady students,
a quick girl, who was so far advanced in her studies as to be able
to spare a few evening hours during the week.
We found a nook in the pretty garden where the lights were
dim and did not hurt my eyes, and I had the great pleasure of
hearing some fine music without the heat and glare, which I
could not bear.
“ Let us come often,” I said, “ this is delightful.”
Why not, she replied, “ it is quite near us, and so cheap we
can well afford it.”
A thrill of happiness went through me, for I love music, and
the long, empty days would be much more endurable if I had
this pleasure to look forward to in the evening.
The words had scarcely been spoken when a man accosted us
with coarse rudeness. As he persisted in his familiarity we rose
133
ANO THER EX PERIEN CE OF EV IL
to go, and he followed us, even mounting the steps of our house
when we reached home.
We tried going to these concerts on one or two other occasions
without a male escort, for neither of us knew any young men in
New York, and each time we were insultingly treated and fol­
lowed, so that we were obliged to give them up.
We had put on dark, simple clothing and plain little hats, and
we had slipped into our places as quietly as we could, looking
neither to the right nor left; nevertheless, on each occasion we
were molested.
I think these men, no matter how coarse-natured they may
have been, would not have deprived me of my one pleasure had
they known how wearily long were my empty days. Their licence
wholly cut me off from such innocent enjoyment as was possible
to me in my dreadfully monotonous life. We may be thankful
that the days are now passed when girls are thought to be loose
characters because they go to amusements unattended.
When I returned to my father in Boston, the news of Helen’s
death reached us. She was pregnant and had eaten some unripe
fruit, which, in her condition, proved to be fatal. She passed
away after a few short days of illness, having died, as people
supposed, through an accident. Yet her death had been foreseen
nine months before by the medium in Boston.
My brother wrote asking if I could come and take care of his
little girls. On the day of my arrival Margaret (Daisy) took pos­
session of Grace’s curling-stick and tried to twist her own straight
hair around it; when it refused to curl, she sat down on the floor
and cried bitterly.
Thus, the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter.
Two busy years passed, devoted to the care of my brother s
children and home, and at the end of them my strength quite
gave way. I could not digest a piece of dry bread without suffering,
and I had so little vitality that I could not keep warm in the hottest
July day.
A cousin of mine had greatly improved at the Water Cure m
New York State, of which I have spoken, and my father and
brother decided it was best to send the children and myself to
this establishment.
I found, on my arrival, that children were not allowed in the
main building; so I discovered, after some research, a little
hut, built around a great walnut-tree, its walls innocent of paint
or paper, but with a splendid view from its tumbledown little
veranda. Here the children and myself were established. About
six weeks after our arrival, I was taken very ill in the night, with
something which closely resembled cholera. A storm was raging,
and we were some distance from the Cure, a rough mountain
path leading to it. About two o’clock, I felt that I was sinkings
and must have some help. Grace, then seven years old, had been
anxiously watching over me, and when she saw that I was almost
in a collapse she said she intended to go to the Cure, a large
building with many corridors, to find one of the doctors. I
feebly protested with the little voice I had left, but she put on her
thick coat, drew the pointed hood over her head, and started out
in the wild night and across the rough mountain track, to make
her way to the Water Cure.
The night watchman afterwards described the scene to me.
He said: I was making my way, with my lantern, along one of
the long, dark corridors, when I suddenly saw a little figure, at
the other end, reaching up to feel the brass numbers on the doors.
The apparition turned a white face to me, surmounted by a high
pointed hood. I thought it was some sort of hobgoblin, and
yelled at it:
“ ‘Who the devil are you?’
I am Grace Dale Owen. My Aunt Rose is very ill at “ The
Perch, and I am trying to find the door of the doctor’s room
to take him over there,’ she said.
Well, you are a brick,’ I said, ‘how did you manage not to
be blown away in this storm, and not to lose vour way in this
black night?’
Please hurry, she said, ‘and show me the doctor’s room,
for my Aunt Rose must be attended to at once.’
I knocked up the doctor, and they were soon on their way
back to ‘The Perch.’ ”
The doctor told me afterwards that had he not been called
until the morning, he doubted whether he could have saved me.
I lay, almost without moving, for eight days, for I was so weak,
I seemed scarcely to be alive.
Then came the turning-point. I weighed at this time only
eighty-one pounds, being little more than a skeleton, and I gained
thirty-four pounds in nine months; the change was so great that
one could scarcely recognize me for the same person. The children
also improved wonderfully, and we were very happy in our little
hut. The system which helped us so much, and to which I after­
wards adhered, whenever I could do so, is the one I wished to
establish among the little group at Haifa.

M Y FATH ER, RO BERT D A LE OWEN, AND K A T IE KING
A t the end of nine months my father came to the Water Cure,
greatly adding to our enjoyment. He was delighted to see what
remarkable progress we had made.
He was asked, presently, to address a meeting at Rochester,
near the Water Cure. The hall was packed and suffocatingly hot,
a cold wind sprang up as we left the hall, and my father, who was
in a profuse perspiration, caught a severe chill. When we returned
to the Water Cure, he was obliged to remain in bed, and yet his
brain seemed to be most active. He insisted on dictating an
abstruse treatise on the “ Unity of God.” In vain I expostulated,
my opposition seeming only to irritate him, and I found that
when I would not write for him he got hold of some paper and
wrote during my absence. The mental activity was, no doubt,
of an abnormal character, and the consequence of using his mind
so strenuously during his weakness proved to be fatal. His brain
became disordered, his mania taking the strange shape of believ-
ing that he was very rich, and when he left his room he threw
money broadcast in the streets.
I found he was drawing out his investments and that he
would soon be penniless.
I sent for my brother Julian, who was deeply distressed when
he arrived. We returned to New Harmony with my father,
having a very trying journey, as he wished, each time the train
stopped, to leave the car, in order to give the people everything
upon which he could lay his hands, the generous instincts which
had always distinguished him seeming to have run wild.
Finally we reached home, and decided that it would be less
trying for my father to be under professional restraint.
We took him to Indianapolis, where he was placed in an
Establishment, and under the supervision of a trained attendant.
The doctor decided it was quite safe to let him have the liberty
of the house and grounds, tactfully watched by the young man
who was to serve him.
My father regained his balance in a short time, and we had the
delight of receiving him again in our New Harmony home.
An exaggerated account of this illness found its way into the
M Y FA TH ER, RO BERT D A LE OWEN 137
newspapers, and it was said that my father had become insane
because of his grief over the imposture of a medium. The Katie
King Affair,” as it was called, was blamed for his breakdown.
So Hr as I could judge, it had nothing to do with it. He men­
tioned the subject to me only once, and then dismissed it, m his
calm ly philosophical way, w ith the words: .
“ I am afraid I have been wasting some precious time, but 1
suppose that is to be expected when one is working in a field so
little explored as yet, and so imperfectly understood. The next
time I shall be even more cautious and exacting in my tests,
taking nothing for granted.” .
He never mentioned the subject afterwards, and had, during
the earlier part of his visit, the calm serenity which had always
distinguished him and which was the wonder and admiration
of us all. Nothing seemed able to distress or even slightly disturb
my optimistic father, with his phenomenally quiet nerves. The
simple cause of his derangement was too strenuous a mental
effort at a time when his body was too weak to endure it; and
as there was no disturbing cause in his mmd, his chief mania
being an exaggerated generosity, he very soon recovered his
balance.
When I returned to New Harmony I found that Julian was
betrothed to be married to a widow with two children. I made
my home with them, and when a little son was born there were
three sets of children in the house. It was not quite easy to steer
one’s way under these circumstances, as my system with Grace
and Margaret differed widely from the ideas of his second wi e.
Still, by dint of prayerful endeavour, a harmoniously affectionate
atmosphere was established at last.
My general health was now much better, but my spine and eyes
had not improved to the same extent.
When I had passed nine years without being able to read oh,
how hungrily I looked at a pile of new books and magazines on
the library table—I went for a short second visit to the Water Cure,
and my sister-in-law joined me in Rochester, New York, when
I was returning.
A celebrated oculist was established here, and Annie, my
sister-in-law, insisted on my going to see him.
“ What is the use, Annie?” I said. “ He will only tell me afresh
that I am going blind.”
138 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
“ Go simply for the sake of being civil to your sister-in-law,
that’s a good girl,” she coaxed.
“ Well, if you put it on that ground, I suppose I must yield,”
I said, “ although I do not want to hear the cruel truth repeated
at the end of these nine long years of constant dread. I know I
am going blind, slowly hut surely, then why should I pay a big
fee to have this fatal fact freshly imprinted on me?”
“ You promised to be polite to your sister-in-law,” laughed
Annie. “ So put on your hat and let us start.”
It was the fifth of July and a very hot day. I dragged myself
wearily along, the prospect of hearing afresh my doom seeming
to pile upon me all the nine long, monotonous years through
which I had struggled. Life seemed to stretch before me as an
arid plain, with no interesting landmarks to vary the tedious
way. I asked myself what was the use of living, when life seemed
to hold so little for me.
When we reached the waiting-room of the oculist, it was
crowded, among the waiting patients being several children who
had been seriously injured the day before through Fourth of
July fireworks. One beautiful boy would be blind for life, so the
sobbing mother told us, when she returned from the office of the
oculist.
My gloom deepened as we waited and watched the returning
patients, some of whom looked greatly depressed after hearing
the oculist s verdict. Several hours passed, and we still waited,
as many of the consultations were long ones. Finally my turn
came. The oculist was a tall, dignified-looking man, with a fine
head and an almost sternly sad face. He questioned me closely,
tested my eyes in numerous ways, and after a very careful exami­
nation, he turned to me and said:
“ You will never go blind. There is nothing the matter with the
retina or the optic nerve, as you think. Unless some unforeseen
accident occurs, you have as good a chance of keeping your eve-
sight as I myself have.”
I looked at him in amazement. I felt that it would be unbearable
were I to permit this hope to enter, and then to be disappointed,
so I said:
“ Doctor, I do not believe you. I am going blind, I know it.
I beg you not to wake in me a false hope.”
He rose, stood by a tall desk, and brought his fist down upon
it with an emphatic gesture:
M Y FA TH ER, RO BERT D A LE OWEN 139
“ If I am mistaken, you can publish the fact everywhere, and
spoil my reputation. I know what I am talking about, and I
give you my word that at the end of a few months you will be
able to use your eyes freely. Through a weakness of the muse es
of the eye, a weakness which seems to extend throughout your
system, you are phenomenally far-sighted to put the thing in
popular parlance—and hence you do not see things close at hand.
“ But, doctor,” I said, “ my eyes pain me cruelly; it seems,
sometimes, as though burning wires ran from my eyes down to
my chest.” , ,
“ Every glance of your eye is as painful as the effort to look;
through a pair of spectacles which do not at all suit you; and,
necessarily, they are constantly being irritated, your brain suffering
as well, and your whole system being more or less affected.
If a perfectly healthy person were to put on glasses which were
quite unsuitable, he or she would soon be tired out. That is
precisely what has been happening to you, during the last nine
The man looked so clever, his regard was so searching, and
his manner so positive, that I dared to let a little ray of hope
enter my sad soul. Was it possible that I should be able to see
again; to read, to write, to resume my music, to go about as
did other people, and see and hear all that was going on? Were the
deadly dull days behind me, and was a new life about to open.
Was it possible that this great, good thing was going to happen
to me? All the weary years in Boston, in New York, in Annies
home, passed before me, when minutes seemed like hours an
hours like days, the long inactivity seeming to be intolerable
to my active brain, my energetic nature. Was all this over, had
God heard my many prayers at last; could it be true that I was
to see again? .
I sent up a cry to my God to guide this man aright, for I ielt
that I could not bear to be filled with this blessed hope, only
to be cast back into darkness.
I looked up at the doctor with beseeching eyes, and he smiled
back at me very gently, the stern sadness of his face being illu­
mined by a kindly sympathy.
“ Yes, I understand,” he said, “ but do not be afraid. Go back
to the waiting-room. I have a few more patients to interview,
and I will then go with you to an optician and see to it that your
glasses suit you. You need the right kind of spectacles, that is

all. Read one minute to-morrow, three minutes the next day, and
so on until you reach an hour a day, then you need no longer time
yourself, but can read as much as you like. Be reasonable, of
course, but you need not be anxious.”
I began the next day, and at the end of a week my eyes pained
me dreadfully. A spasm of despair seized me—was the doctor
mistaken, and was I only hastening the day of my doom? I wrote
to him and received a short, but emphatic, reply:
“ Do as I tell you. Had your arm been out of use for nine
years, it would pain you when you began to exercise it. It is the
same with your eyes. Obey orders and your sight will be restored.”
He was right. At the end of six months I was reading com­
fortably, and my life, which had seemed as a dreary desert, now
spread before me as a varied, a beautiful landscape. Two little
pieces of glass (my spectacles) altered the face of the earth for
me, and with my whole heart did I thank the oculist and the
optician for the scientific skill which had changed my life. It is
indeed a noble mission to restore to use that which the Creator
has made.
When I rejoined Annie and told her the good news, she was
overjoyed.
There, you see, it is a good thing to be polite to your sister-
in-law, she said, with a happy laugh.
As we returned home, the way, which had seemed so drearily
ong in coming, was wonderfully short, for I walked with wings
on my feet. I wanted to salute everyone on the way, and to share
with them the happiness which thrilled me. My heart seemed to
leap in my bosom for joy.
A NEW LO VER
D uring the last year of my blindness, I had undertaken to hold
meetings for the children of the village in our church. We had
a simple little service. I told them stories wherein a right and a
wrong course of action were set in contrast, sometimes asking
some child to finish the tale. I gave them a little task of a moral
nature at home, and distributed gifts among those who could
bring a good report.
The teachers at the public school told me that the chief subject
discussed during the recreation hours were these stories and the
moral each was intended to convey. Presently the church was
crowded, not only with children, but with their parents, who
thanked me warmly for the influence exerted. I adopted the
system of letting the children fix their own punishments when
they misbehaved, which they did with an almost stem justice.
But the exertion had been too much for me, and I was holding
the last crowded meeting. I noticed in the body of the church a
strikingly handsome man, a stranger. The next evening a friend
brought him to call upon us, and a few weeks later he asked me
to marry him.
He was an exceedingly attractive man. Gifted in various
directions, and so remarkable in appearance that he was much
observed. He took me to a neighbouring city for a little excursion,
and I noticed that almost everyone in the street turned to look
after him. God, knowing my love for beauty, has often been good
enough to surround me with beautiful people.

me in our little church and had loved me at first sight.

brought him to call upon us, and a few weeks later he asked me
to marry him.
He was an exceedingly attractive man. Gifted in various
directions, and so remarkable in appearance that he was much
observed. He took me to a neighbouring city for a little excursion,
and I noticed that almost everyone in the street turned to look
after him. God, knowing my love for beauty, has often been good
enough to surround me with beautiful people.
When he asked me to become his wife, he told me that he was
a divorced man; he had married very young, and had lived with
his wife only a year. He had one son, now about twelve years
old. He had not intended to be married again, until he had seen
me in our little church and had loved me at first sight.
I did not know what I ought to do; whether I ought to permit
myself to consider his proposal of marriage to the extent of seeing
him often, with a view to discovering whether we were suited to
each other, or whether I ought to refuse him at once. He had
so potent a charm that everyone felt it, even the children being
strongly drawn to him. It was, I think, more magnetic than
I do not trunk i ougnt to consider tne question ot marrying
you, unless your divorced wife gives her consent If she is willing
that you should marry me, then I will not resist the thought of
caring for you, should love for you be born in my heart.”
“ I think I am not mistaken in believing that you are drawn to
me,” he said, “ that it is a possible thing for you to love me?”
“ I am bewildered,” I answered, “ for it is not plain to me where
my duty lies, and until that question is settled, I do not quite
know how I do feel towards you. As long as my conscience is at
war with love for you, that love cannot enter and take possession.”
He wrote to his divorced wife and she strongly objected to our
marriage. Therefore, we parted from one another.

for means. He lodged in the same house, and when I found he
was in danger of dying, I devoted myself to him, running the
gauntlet of a good deal of criticism, for it was thought wrong
for me to attend to him. He, however, believed that I was the
only person who could save his life, and it would seem as though
he were right, for one night when I watched with him alone, he
appeared to be dying. He was quite cold, and I could scarcely
hear him breathe. His face was ghastly. He had lost a good deal
of blood from the bowels during several weeks, and his life seemed
to be ebbing away. I had done all that the doctor had directed
without result, so I knelt down by his bedside and wrestled for
his life. He was a young man full of promise, whose fine singing
had touched me deeply, and it did not seem to me that God wished
him to be taken thus prematurely. Through the long night I
wrestled in prayer, scarcely knowing whether he breathed or
not. Towards morning he opened his eyes, smiling at me faintly,
and I knew that life was returning to him.
In a few weeks he was well, and I was very glad that I had not
failed him in order to avoid gossip; for it seemed to me it would
have been a very selfish thing to protect myself at the risk of
losing a human life.
Then a strange situation developed; I knew, in my heart, that
I did not love this man. I felt assured that he, like Dr. A., could
never quite satisfy me intellectually, and yet the thought of him
tormented me day and night. When he was absent, I longed
to see him; when he was present, I felt chained. Later, when we
no longer lived in the same place, I was constantly tormented by
the desire to receive letters from him, and was always watching
for the post, and restlessly wandering about until it came.
I was deeply puzzled, for I knew I did not love him. In answer
to prayer, the only impression I had, while we were under the

spiritual, but it was difficult to resist, aided as it was by his
almost perfect beauty, and his good breeding, for he belonged to
a well-known family.
From the first, however, I was uneasily aware that I ought to

144 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
the young man about my strange experience, and he told me, in
plain words, that although he reverenced me deeply, almost
setting me in a shrine, he did not love me.
I hoped this declaration would break my chains, but instead
it seemed to rivet them. His image haunted me day and night,
and I could not resist the strange influence he, or some tor­
menting power of evil using his personality, exercised over me.
I knew that the attraction belonged, not to the realm of true
love, but to the spurious world of magnetic attraction, poorly
imitating love, and yet I was in its grip.
One day, when my work had been seriously disturbed because
my attention was constantly on the alert to hear the postman’s
knock, I sent up a great cry to God to deliver me from this
uncanny bondage, telling Him I was helpless. The answer was
instantaneous. Whereas in the morning I would have walked
until I was footsore to see his handwriting, at night I scarcely
took the trouble to go downstairs to receive my mail.
A few days later we met. He looked blankly disappointed at
my indifferent manner, and now that my eyes were opened I
marvelled that I had ever imagined I cared for him.
I was deeply grateful that I had been guided to make myself
so little attractive to him, and had obeyed the instinct; for I think
he might have been drawn to me, had I done otherwise, and both
of us would have been unhappy in marriage.
Later, when Jennie attacked me, she cited against me the fact
that I had taken care of this young man in his illness; and although
I had shared with him the small sum of money I then had in hand,
to keep him from want (a debt afterwards repaid) and, so he
believed, had saved his life, yet he proved a broken reed.
When closely questioned, he acknowledged that I had only
set aside the conventions, and that there was no thought of evil
between us, but only a life and death struggle to save him; yet
he did not come forward promptly, manfully, as my warm cham­
pion, but seemed rather to be influenced by the rich and powerful
faction against me.
As I had helped him for many months, and had borne a good
deal of unkind criticism for the sake of doing what I believed to
be my duty towards him, for I could not shield myself and let
him die through illness and want, his conduct astonished and
pained me, and I was most thankful that I had been freed from
him.
A M AGNETIC TEM PTATION 145
I have sometimes wondered how many marriages are made
while under this false magnetic glamour, a glamour which may
be dissipated in an hour, leaving the disillusioned victim fettered
for life. No one need mistake the false attraction for the true
bond, for there is a well-marked difference between the two;
magnetic attraction rivets chains, whereas real love confers
freedom; the one narrowly circumscribes, while the other vastly
enlarges the legitimate joys of life. I trembled when I realized how
obscurely small, how seemingly unimportant, had been the act
of obedience which, in all probability, had saved me. I was told
to be as ugly and stupid as possible, and I obeyed; hence the
chains which held me were not riveted on the young artist.
Is it not true that God would guide, in the same way, all those who
are magnetically allured, only to be deeply disappointed through
long years of regret, were they to ask Him for light, being willing,
whatever might be His commands, to obey Him implicitly? Is it
not strange that, in a Christian world, so few people seem to
beseech God to guide them with regard to the person they should
marry? Many clever minds have spent long hours discussing the
laws of divorce, with the desire of reducing the evil as much as
possible. Would it not be wiser to teach, everywhere, this simple
truth: Those who can be put asunder were not joined by God?
Were all lovers to entreat their Creator to illumine them, being
willing to part, instantly, should He command it, would there
be many divorces? I think not, for God does not mislead, or
permit to be misled, those who sincerely pray, desiring only to
know and to do His 'Will. This simple obedience would save
endless miseries in marriage and do away with divorce.

to grief and be stranded without money; but we got back, after
a happy year, with just five dollars in our pockets. I packed
curtains, linen, silver, pictures, and ornaments, in goods boxes
which had been prepared with shelves. We rented a little flat
in the workmen’s quarter of New York, bought some cots, tables,
and chairs, set up our boxes as bureaux and cupboards, decorated
the walls and windows with their contents, and proceeded to
study and to enjoy ourselves. Several young men, students and
beginners in some profession, were introduced to us by a friend.
They were living homeless lives in little rooms, and begged to
be allowed to visit us without ceremony. They were fine young
fellows, and I told them they were entirely welcome, provided
they would allow us to treat them as members of the family,
not leaving my work.
So our little flat was full to overflowing almost every evening,
even the fire-escape being pressed into service when the small
drawing-room could hold no more. They sometimes brought a
supper with them, and we had the jolliest of improvised meals,
when even the toasting-fork had to be pressed into service to
set the table, our resources being limited.
It was a most innocently happy little company, and when we
returned to New Harmony the boys thanked us most warmly,
saying they had been kept from mischief by being allowed to
come to a home in their workaday clothes, where they were
not entertained, but did as they liked, precisely as though they
had been in their own families, which were far distant from New
York.

I seemed groping for some truth which was still hidden from me.
My mother’s cry, vibrating through me before I was born,
sounded ever more insistently within me. I besought my God,
even as she had entreated while bearing me, to reveal Himself
to me more fully, for I often felt too weakly uncertain to help
others.
I was led at this time to return to the East, visiting the home
of a cousin, and here an answer came to me.
The atmosphere of the house was not one that appealed to me,
for my cousin was somewhat morbidly mystical, surrounding
herself with many symbols, and going through various cere­
monies which were supposed to convey a mysterious insight to
the onlooker, but which, so far as I was concerned, often dis­
tressed my common sense. She was also a Church Member, and
went frequently to the daily services. But she neglected a
good many of her homely duties, and, in consequence, selfishly
though perhaps unconsciously, put a double burden on
others.
She was, however, a beautiful and a gifted woman, possessing
an extraordinary charm; and from my early girlhood I had loved
and admired her. Thus at one moment she strongly attracted
me, and the next my mother’s training influenced me, a training
inculcating all the homely virtues. My beautiful cousin seemed
to me both lazy and selfish, and I had been taught that a lazy
selfishness and religion could never be akin.
Nevertheless, God, who knew her true, her best self, chose
her as a fitting instrument and her house as the place where He
answered my prayer, growing ever more persistently strong;
for some need existed within me, which was not filled, and I ever
besought Him to fill it.
One Sunday morning my cousin asked me to go to church

W ith returning health and eyesight a desire awoke in me, grow­
ing ever deeper, to serve, in a wider sphere, my fellow-creatures.
I seemed groping for some truth which was still hidden from me.

with her.
“ My dear Isabel,” I said, “ you know I don’t care to go to
church, long ceremonies do not appeal to me.”
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E

In answer she repeated the words of my sister-in-law when my
physical sight was restored:
“ Well, then, come in order to be polite to your cousin. You
are my guest, and you ought not to be so uncivil as to refuse.”
“ Very well,” I said, “ but I warn you that I shall not fit into the
picture. I can and do pray sincerely, but cut-and-dried prayers
and formal ceremonies only irritate me. When these prayers are
intoned they almost make me angry, they sound so insincere to
my matter-of-fact mind.”
“ You have promised to be polite,” she reiterated, even as
Annie had done. “ Go and put on your cloak and hat, that’s a
good girl; for it is time to start.”
The church to which we went was familiarly known as “ The
little Church around the Corner,” because of the following
incident: An actor was to be buried. His friends went to a large
and fashionable church where the clergyman did not wish to
have anything to do with the burial of an actor, and advised his
friends to take him to “ the little church around the corner,” where
all sorts of waifs and strays were received. The name clung to the
church, lovingly repeated by many grateful ones, who had found
a like sympathy and support in the unpretending structure, until
its real name, “ The Church of the Transfiguration,” was almost
forgotten.
I sat stiff and unbending in my seat, with a sense of revolt in
my heart. My mother had taught us to be sincere, unaffected, and
to my ears the prayers did not seem to ring quite true. Even when
the saintly pastor of the church appeared in the pulpit, I gave
a somewhat unwilling attention, at first, to his simple sermon.
But his manner was so genuine that he presently held my admiring
attention.
Then followed the Communion Service. I made a sign to my
cousin that I wished to go, as I had no sympathy at all with this
ceremony; but she begged me to remain, and as I did not desire
to be discourteous I leaned back, somewhat wearily, in my seat,
and watched the elaborately dressed women and worldly looking
men making their way to and from the Altar.
Is there any sense in all this,” I said to myself, “ does it do
anybody a particle of good to go through this mummery?”
The reader must remember that I had been bred in a family
which rarely went to church, but which practised the Christian
virtues. And on the other hand, I had known a number of people
M Y CONVERSION 149
who did go constantly to church and who did not, so it seemed to
me, practise the Christian virtues. As my cousin went to the Altar,
I remembered how long she had remained in bed the day before,
Saturday, and had hindered all the work falling on this day, so that
the servant was obliged to labour very late, and would not have
been able to finish had I not helped her. My cousin had spent the
afternoon in the drawing-room arrayed in a garment which was
supposed to symbolize that she had been initiated into some sort
of occult knowledge. When I had returned, hot and tired, from
the kitchen, I had been a good deal irritated by her pose and her
demand that I should sit at a table, supposed to be sacred, in a
certain position, and go through various genuflexions, making
the signs she indicated.
“ Isabel,” I said, “ I have been helping Mary and I am tired.
If you want to go through any incantations you must do it alone.”
As I thought of all this, my mother’s image rose before me.
She had made no pretence to piety, and certainly never indulged
in hanky-panky; but in all her life, so far as I knew, she had not
neglected a duty. This was the school in which I had been bred.
I believed in salvation through works, and I was a Unitarian.
My prayers were fervent, but they were not the pleadings of a
Christian, for I rejected the teachings of the New Testament, as
expounded by the Church.
Not long before, a good and venerable bishop had kept me in
his study four long hours, seeking to persuade me that he was
right and I was wrong. Finally I said to him:
“ You affirm that God was angry with this world, and that when
His wrath was appeased, because His Son had been cruelly sacri­
ficed, He pardoned us. Were I to behave in such a manner, I
should consider my conduct despicable; hence were I to believe
what you tell me, I should lose my faith in God. You say, further,
that we are all at fault because of Adam’s sin, and that we are
all justified because of Christ’s sacrifice. I had nothing to do with
Adam’s sins, then why should I be told that I, in anywise, share
his guilt; and seeing that I must struggle and strive every day to
five a good life, and when I do not exert myself I am certain to
fail, how can I accept that Christ does this work for me? Were
these things to be written in letters of fire across the sky, I might
believe them; but as no such miracle has happened, both my
common sense and my experience reject your teachings.”
This, then, was my frame of mind as I made way for my cousin
150 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
to re-enter the pew, after coming from the Communion Table,
my conviction being in complete antagonism to the ceremony
which was proceeding. I was weary and cold and my chief desire
was to get out of the sombre church.
My cousin had scarcely resumed her seat when my whole
being was roused and thrilled by the sight which I saw. On the
Altar stood the most glorious Figure I had ever looked on, so
glorious that no imagination of mine could have painted it, for
its splendour was beyond my range of conception. I had never
dreamt that such power and such sweetness could exist; and yet
it was a man, with the familiar lineaments I was daily accustomed
to seeing. Heaven and earth were joined. For a moment His
wonderful eyes looked down at the Communicants, and then He
turned and stretched out His arms to me. I ran headlong to the
Altar, and knelt with the others, hiding my face because I could
not bear His splendour. When I looked up the Form was gone.
The Figure I had seen in the garden at the time of my mother’s
death had been a vague shape, wrapped in light, and I could not
distinguish any features. But the Form on the Altar was clearly
outlined; I saw the lineaments, the golden hair, the eyes of
heavenly blue, the magnificent brow, conveying to me a sense
of brain-power such as I had never imagined, even while the
eyes gazed at me with an infinitely tender love. Strong He was
as an Archangel, and yet gentle as the meekest creature that
breathes. It was this union of force and exquisitely yielding
sweetness which astounded me; for in all the pictures of Christ
which I have seen, the gentleness borders almost on weakness,
and there is no trace of the all-searching mentality, the overpower­
ing virility, which I perceived in this perfect God-man.
My whole soul went out to Him, at once and for ever. Every
fibre in me acknowledged Him as Master. Every heart-throb pro­
claimed Him as King.
I have sometimes heard Christians doubt whether Christ
will be able to conquer all men in the end. The sin is so great,
the work so overwhelmingly difficult, they say, that it seems
impossible to believe that He will bring all creatures to His feet.
I have no shadow of doubt that He will reign at last, everywhere;
for no mortal, though he were steeped in hellish sins, could
resist Him. Nothing could have kept me from Him when he
stretched out His arms to me, and when He pleads with others
in the same wise, as He is sure to do before the end, they also will
M Y CONVERSION 151
fall at His feet as I did, for He is irresistible. Closer akin than the
tenderest lover, yet He stands by the throne of God. Permeating
us so intimately that no thought is hidden from Him, neverthe­
less He calls us from the heights of Heaven. How, then, shall
any poor, wandering, helpless mortal refuse to come to Him, at
last, when His love reaches to the most secret places within us,
even while it fills the heavenly vault above us. Neither sin nor
pain, neither woe nor want, neither separation nor death daunt
Him, for God has given to our King sufficient power to overcome
every earthly evil. Blind we are, as blind as moles, but hide
away as we will, our Redeemer will find us, for Divine Love
searches through the nethermost hells, so long as one spark
answering Him may be found.
From the moment I looked upon that Form I felt assured of
the eventual salvation of the world; and from that day a desire
has possessed me, so strong as to seem, at times, almost like an
agony, to hasten the day when He can stand before us in His
Glory, claiming His full reward.
Then and there I said to Him, “ Use me as Thou wilt, I am ready.
I only ask that the way shall be made plain, and when I see clearly
I will walk therein, God helping me, no matter what the diffi­
culties may be.”
I know that every living soul will repeat these same words,
when once they have looked upon His Form, and so my prayer
has come to be the homely, simple prayer which once I ridiculed,
“ Lord, convert this man or woman.”
We poor mortals are very weak, so I stumbled and fell many
times after I had seen this glorious Vision; but the memory of
it ever strengthened me afresh, giving me courage to begin anew.
I should be perfect, I know it, after looking on Perfection, but
I remain only a weak, ordinary woman, given to the petty faults
of other women. I belong to the common herd, and am in no­
wise a glory to my Lord—but were all the world to tell me that
Christ is a myth, and that His Mission exists only in fancy, the
denial of Him would not weaken my faith for one instant.
I know that my Redeemer fives, for I have seen Him, precisely
as I know that the sun shines, because I have seen it.
Having given me this unspeakable privilege, Christ has seen
fit to let me be tried beyond the ordinary, as He had a right to do;
for a faith strengthened as mine had been ought never to fail,
no matter what fate overtakes me. And, thank God, it never has
152 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
quite failed, although at times my soul has reeled close to the
abyss of despair.
When I have described this Vision to others, they have said
that I was mistaken, that my imagination had created this Form.
That is impossible, for my imagination is wholly incapable of
creating a Divinity, infinitely above and beyond me. His Person­
ality is greater than anything my conceptive powers can build,
and because He was real, living, the influence of this Vision has
been not evanescent but permanent. It has influenced, always
and everywhere, my whole fife; and no mistaken mortal imagina­
tion has this persevering power, lasting always and under all
possible circumstances.
I have seen Him, others will see Him; and when we have all
beheld Him, no man will be able to forget Him and to cease
from adoring Him.
Since this Vision was vouchsafed I have felt assured that, in
the end, all men must needs be saved through Christ, our Re­
deemer and our King, more intimately ours than the nearest
lover, and yet more divinely great than the imagination of man
can conceive. We are safe, for He will save us, but oh! fellow-
Christians, do not let us keep Him waiting too long for His
Consummation. Every mean word, or act, or thought, burdens
Him; then let us cease, through His help, to be ignoble.
In seeking to reach Him, may every woman reader remember
that the first sound which vibrated through me, lying next to my
mother’s heart, was her cry to find her G od; and hence I had been
urged to search for Him all my life until I had found Him.
Women, to whom God has confided the greatest responsibility
on earth, the responsibility of Motherhood, can serve Him as no
painter, no musician, no orator can do; for these teachers only
interpret and imitate God, whereas a mother witnesses how He,
moving within her, creates a new life. He hears her petition,
when she ever beseeches that her babe may be made in His image,
and hence through its mothers may the world be most quickly
saved.
M Y CHRISTIAN EDUCATION
T he next morning, Monday, the Voice began my education as a
Christian, and my first command was: “ Put your bureau drawers
in better order, for were God as disorderly as you are, the Cosmos
would return to chaos.” When the injunction was made I remem­
bered that I had left them in confusion, being busy for a week
or two. The next injunction was to walk about the streets of New
York, seeking in every face a trace of the Divine. I stared until
my eyes were weary and those I met were incensed at my seeming
rudeness; yet, sometimes, I could find nothing which seemed to
me to be Godlike.
On several days I returned worn out and discouraged. But I
began afresh the next morning, and finally I found that I was
becoming much more keen-sighted. In the coarsest face, even
those that answered my searching gaze with a leer, I began to
discover traces of God. The droop of an eyelid, the curve of a lip,
the contour of a cheek, the virility in vigorous hair, a firm tread,
a kind expression, or a gentle gesture— something I found which
reminded me that God had made men; and that they still walked
the earth, hopefully, because the divinity in them was not dead.
One morning I started early, in order to continue the effort
of finding Him in humanity, and passed on the way a scavenger s
cart, which was malodorous. I hastened by with a sense of
disgust, when I heard some one say “ Stop.” I looked behind
me, and could perceive no one, then I realized that it was the
Voice, but speaking so emphatically that it seemed to be a
material sound.
“ If you wish to despise anyone, look down on the luxurious
inmates of these costly houses before you, from whence the
garbage comes. They, in all probability, have eaten too much,
and wasted too much, hence this overloaded cart.
I accepted the rebuke, and by way of apology, I turned to
look at the driver of the cart in order to discover the divine spar
in him. I had some difficulty, but finally a kindly gleam in his
eyes answered my smile of greeting, and instead of feeling dis­
gusted, a friendly warmth filled my heart as I bade him good­
morning; a good will he seemed to share, for he returned my
i54 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
salute heartily. So the scavenger and I parted as friends instead
of enemies.
It was a simple little experience; and yet were it repeated many
times among many persons, would it not go far to remove the
ever-growing antagonism between the rich and the poor. Some­
one must cart off the refuse of the city, or else we would soon be
buried in filth; hence the dustmen must exist. But seeing that it
is our dirt they are carrying away, need we despise them, because
of the disagreeable task they are performing for us? Instead, is
it not our duty to be more alert in order to discover God in them,
and so repay them, not through the pity that half despises that
which it pities, but through the sympathy that searches out the
best in our neighbour, and so presents to him his own image,
ennobled. This best self in the scavenger is his permanent self,
this model man, this Higher Ego, is the everlasting man; then
why should our gaze dwell on the dirty clothes which he wears,
instead of seeking for the shining robe, endlessly enduring,
which awaits him, provided he does his hard work as well as it
can be done, and so earns his true place in heaven.
A similar experience came to me in the “ Little Church around
the Corner ” on the next Sunday. A poor and rather dirty-looking
woman passed down the aisle, for many toilers found their way
to the church, the congregation being curiously composed of the
very rich, the very poor, and a group of people who were evi­
dently actors and actresses, and who joined in the service devoutly.
As the woman passed the end of my pew I thought instinctively,
I hope she won’t come in here,” for I have a very keen scent,
and an ill-smelling person gives me nausea. Again the Voice
almost thundered at me: “ You have had the leisure this morning
to take a luxurious bath, and to put on the clean clothes washed
and ironed by someone else; you have risen at your usual hour
to come here, and eaten a breakfast cooked by someone else,
and you will find a good dinner ready prepared when you return.
Therefore, you have made no sacrifice to come to church. Whereas
this poor woman, with everything to do at home, has had to
rise early, to hurry her work, to dress as best she could, and to
tramp here on foot. When she returns, she must herself prepare
the dinner before she can eat it. Hence she has made a sacrifice
to come to church.
Yet you take her by the shoulders and push her out of the
Sanctuary. For were your thought translated into an act, and
M Y CHRISTIAN EDUCATION 155
were all the others in the church as inhospitable, the poor woman
would be bundled out of the sacred edifice into the street.
“ It is true that her clothes are not attractive, but have you any
means of knowing whether her soul is attractive? May not the
toil of her hands support, with uncomplaining cheerfulness,
some helpless charge, and by doing her duty, may she not have
discovered, as you have, that Christ is her truest friend? Hence
may she not be close akin to you, because you are serving the same
great Master?”
The tears came to my eyes as I acknowledged my fault, and
realized how much I had to learn, before I could comprehend the
all-embracing Love of the Saviour, who stretches out His arms
to every meanest creature, even as He had held them out to me.
I had a very long way to go, I knew, and my heart sank within
me.
When I returned home, I threw myself on my knees and shyly,
for the first time in my life, although I was now thirty-five years
old, pronounced His name in prayer. As I formed the words,
“ Christ, help me,” a honeyed sweetness poured through me, and
the revelation came to me, which comes to every true Christian,
sooner or later, that in truth He has taken our burdens upon
Himself. I had held this belief in scorn, and now through the
simple experiences of the week following the Sunday wherein
I had seen the Vision, I was already learning the truth of the
sentence, “ Without Me ye can do nothing,” and I was already
feeling the exquisite relief which this knowledge brings. Having
seen His Perfection, I knew, knew unquestioningly, that I could
never reach Perfection in my own right; and so I asked Him to
carry me as a little child is carried in loving arms.
When I rose from my knees, I looked at my reflection in the
glass with amazement. Was this Rosamond Dale Owen, the
self-sufficient, the proudly reserved and aristocratic woman,
who had believed that she had sufficient strength to walk to God s
Throne alone? Now I was persuaded, once and for ever, that He
would always help me, when I told Him I could no longer climb
unaided.
To the reader with sturdy common sense who is inclined to
reject anything which seems to be of a supernatural nature,
and hence thinks that it is impossible for me, or for anyone, to
see visions, may I recall the simple and reasonable teachings o
the Voice.
M ARY
On the Sunday following my conversion, I again went with my
cousin to church, this time with an eager willingness, and again
my true, my spiritual eyes were opened, the only eyes that I feel
I can really trust, and a second Vision was vouchsafed to me.
It was not palpable, objective, as was the Form of Christ,
but rather seemed as an inner Presence. Yet were I a painter 1
could repeat every trait of the wonderful face I saw, so plainly
outlined was it, and so indelibly impressed on my memory. I
remember no material countenance as I remember these spiritual
features.
This Vision revealed to me Mary, the Holy One, and all my
life have I thanked God for showing Her to me.
Again all my preconceptions were proved to be mistaken ones.
Whereas the virile mentality of Christ had astonished me, the
exquisite simplicity of the Blessed Mary was equally amazing.
She was not like any picture of Her which I had seen, for She was
the Incarnation of Youth. The face was round rather than oval;
the brow low and full rather than expansive; the features, although
beautifully chiselled, were not statuesque, but were the traits of
loveliest girlhood. She looked little more than a child, a divine
child, and yet I was aware that wisdom informed every fibre of
Her being. She knew all things, because the Spirit taught Her,
and not because She had studiously learnt them. As I looked at
Her, all my strenuous research, my hard study, my complex
mental queries seemed to be nonsense. My big head appeared to
me to be a caricature, for She knew more in one short instant
than did all the students the world held, simply because every
atom of Her being was permeated by God, who knows every-
thing. There was no hindering question in Her mind, no resistance
in the most hidden fibre of Her being; and so, because of Her
perfect faith, He could thrill, with Hts creative power, Her whole
Organism, pure as was the original Essence out of which He
formed the spirits of men.
I understood, further, why the world, which has been told that
the Generations should call Her blessed, still ignores Her, to a
great extent, and fails to lift Her to Her true place. She is so
M ARY 157
exquisite a child, that Her simplicity is incomprehensible to us.
We, with our inflated egoisms, our clamouring demands, our
exaggerated elaborations of thought—we cannot understand
an Organism with so little self-consciousness that God may
permeate it without let or hindrance. She seemed to be made up
only of a few simple lines defining a contour called Mary, and all
the rest was G od; He filled Her wholly.
To be like Her, oh! to be like Her, this was the cry that rose
in my heart. I detested my own cumbersome self, when I perceived
what a Holy Woman is like, and I knew that I would have to be
born again, and again, and yet again, before I could get rid of all
the useless elaborations we call personal gifts. Simply to be a
receptive channel for my God, this was all I had to learn, for this
is womanly wisdom, and yet how long would it take me to be
quit of all my encumbrances. Christ, whose mission it is to give,
is the most complex Being I have ever beheld; but Mary, whose
mission it is to receive, is the simplest, so that it is possible for
Her to conceive, unhindering, all things, in trust for all men.
I realized that the powers of evil are trying to hide this truth
from women, and are seeking to tempt them to be like men.
The attempt is useless, as useless as the attempt to make mothers
into fathers. The missions of the sexes are totally different, as
I was persuaded, when the Prototypes of men and women, Christ
and Mary, were revealed to me. Mary may know all that Christ
knows, but She has this fullness of knowledge not because with
a giant’s brain She formulates it, as He does, perfectly under­
standing and fully utilizing, as chief Scientist, every subtlest
element used in creating life; but because with a Spirit great
enough to comprehend God, She conceives true Wisdom.
Crystal pure, undefiled, She mirrors, untarnished, His glory,
through an effortless receptivity.
I saw, further, that until I became like Mary, Christ could have
no real pleasure in me. His love would be infinitely compassionate,
but not personally satisfied, for I was a caricature compared to the
Woman nearest and dearest to Him.
Years have passed over my head since the overwhelming desire
to be like the Holy Mary awoke in me. Am I any nearer to my
ideal? I do not know. Sometimes it seems to me that I have made
no progress at all. And yet the desire remains as strong as it was
on the day it was born, in the Church of the Transfiguration. I
only know this: taught by my love for Her, the tiniest flower on
1 58 M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
Mount Carmel thrills its unclaiming beauty through me, as the
most elaborate worldly pomp is not able to do. The dear eyes of
the babies I meet by the way, smile at me as though we had a
secret in common. The meek nuns with whom I have often dwelt
on Mount Carmel are affectionately at home with me, different
as is our outlook; and above all the love between the sexes seems
to me so holy a thing that the coarsest phase of it can no longer
distress me for long; for the pure love of pure lovers is so heavenly
that every creature must needs long for it in the end.
So much has my love for the Holy One, for the child who,
unresisting, received Her God, taught me; through Her all
goodness and innocence are akin to me; and in addition I have
been made to understand how She, the tenderest Flower on earth,
could stand as a Pillar of Strength at the foot of the Cross; so that
She could take up Her burden, unmurmuring, when He was gone.
For She who receives all things from God can be fortified,
as the need of the hour demands it, to bear all things. As Her
strength is God’s strength, it could not fail, even when the
greatest agony the world has ever known was given Her to endure,
for She was asked to look upon the Perfection of Her Beloved,
and to see this Perfection tortured until He hung, a wretchedly
disfigured corpse, mocked at by His humanity, the humanity He
was asked to save. These were the heavenly and hellish extremes
She saw with eyes scanning more clearly than any common eyes
can do, and yet She gave no sign of despair. She endured to the
end. This was the strength of this exquisitely tender Being
embodying all maidenhood.
As I sit writing in a little pine wood on Mount Carmel, I am
surrounded by Her Woman’s world of beauty. The dear wild
flowers, anemones, cyclamens, Carmel roses, with hosts of
humbler beauties, sway in the soft wind; which, though it rose
yesterday to a hurricane, did not destroy them, for they bent,
unresisting, to the fury of the gale. These flowers, each as finely
finished as though it were meant for a king’s table, belong to
Her Realm. No human eye may look upon them, in the remoter
slopes of Carmel, and yet they bloom on, neglecting no most
delicate tracery of beauty, which God meant them to perfect.
Like these unseen flowers, She is waiting meekly, unobserved,
until the generations shall call Her blessed; and while She waits
HerrWisdom ever perseveres to adorn, with delicate precision,
the finely^wrought robes destined, at last, to clothe God-like men;
M ARY H 9
Yet this Holy One has shared the commonest duties and penalties
of the commonest woman on earth, and because She has thus
laboured and suffered, even while Heaven visited Her, may each
of us seek Her in our need. She understands all our hard duties,
because She has performed the meanest toil.
I pray that we Protestants may not ignore the Place She fills,
for if we do not heed the injunction of the Bible, we shall suffer
for it in the end. The divine Woman Principle cannot be neglected
without dire consequences.
SEX
T h e morning after this Revelation, I was led to rise at four
o’clock, and when dressed to make my way to a green square
near our house. Only the earliest workers and homeless ones were
afoot, the rest of the city being still asleep. I had begun to scan the
faces of the few sleepy passers-by, in order to discover the divine
spark in them, as I thought I had been sent out to continue this
task, when the Voice said: “ Do not look but listen: Many babes
have been waked to new life in this city during the night which
is passing; how many of them have been brought into being
through a physical appetite, and how many through a prayerful
love? If the majority have been roused on this and other nights,
through a physical appetite, the city will deteriorate; if they
have been called from the Unseen through a love which is
prayerfully obedient to the Creator, the city will advance, aye by
leaps and bounds. Here lies the dividing line: When men and
women seek their God before they venture to seek one another;
when wedded ones pray, until sex love becomes holy; when true
lovers first search for His Purity, and only when they have found
it do they venture to create—in that hour is the salvation of
humanity assured. Until children are waked through this sainted
desire, no other reforms whatsoever can be thorough and
permanent, for the stream of life will ever be freshly polluted at
its source; how, then, can any after-cleansing purify it effectually?
“ In this work of sanctification you are asked to help. It is a
most difficult task, and the powers of evil will resist it to the
utmost, for their reign will be over when pure sex love triumphs.
Here do they find their best opportunity to antagonize their
Creator, and here, when they are beaten, will their downfall be
most complete.
“ Are you ready to suffer,” said the Voice, “ for the sake of
babes yet unborn?”
I quailed at the question, for, like other women of the austere
type, I had hated the word sex. I should have been glad, in my
youth, had there been no such word and no such emotion in
the world, for the thought of it had often filled me with disgust.
The Voice continued: “ You have seen how passion has moved
SEX 161
your lovers, having been almost stronger than themselves; hence
you are sufficiently experienced to know that it is impossible to
kill sex-love, and were it possible to destroy it the world would
soon swing in space only as the carrier of corpses.
“ A s it cannot be annihilated, it must be hallowed, if the world is
to be saved. The celibate monk and nun, faithful to their solemn
vows, have a mission to fulfil, it is true; but it is a limited one,
for were the whole world to imitate their celibacy there would
be no world to be saved at the end of a hundred years. Therefore,
this cannot be the way out of the difficulty, and hence some other
means must be found.
“ Our simple advice is,” said the Voice, “ that no mates should
ever permit a sex sensation to surge through them, whether
expressed through the lightest hand-touch, or the marital act,
until prayer has spiritualized their passion. Only in the presence
of God may a legitimate caress be given. When this injunction
is obeyed love will no longer incline brute-ward, but will rise
angel-ward. So must a purer race be born, thus can the world be
best cleansed from sin. Are you willing to help in this work?”
“ How?” I asked.
“ You must pray without ceasing for purity, you must ask that
women shall imitate the blessed Mary, radiating so holy a love
that lust will slink away, ashamed. You must importune Heaven
until you get your answer, you, yourself, embodying, at last, the
love, rich and yet undefiled, which God is waiting to give to
humanity. Though you be four-score years before your answer
comes, still must you persevere, for dead as you are yet must you
be made living.
“ The centrifugal or male, and centripetal or female, Principles
sustain the Universe, and hence these all-moving Energies must
be perfected ere that Universe can be saved. When these positive
and receptive Forces answer one another in a swiftly balanced
poise, then will men rise to meet Him, transfigured in the air.
So only can the world be redeemed. It is the Law. Everywhere
is humanity struggling towards this goal, aye, through all positive
effort, mental or physical; and through all concentrative recep­
tivity, mental or physical. Thus are men and women being
prepared, through the slow centuries, until they can no longer
be given in marriage, because they are one and undivided as is
the Male and Female Image of God in whose Likeness we are
made. Every hand hurling an axe stroke, and concentrating its
L
M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
162
grip to hurl it afresh, is advancing this positive and receptive
development.
“ Speech will be of some use, and writing will advance the world
a little, and where these serve you must speak and write, but these
are crude expressions; prayer, fervent and incessant prayer, is
much more efficacious.
“ Are you ready to undertake this task?” reiterated the
Voice.
“ If it will bring a very little nearer the victory of Christ and
Mary, I am willing, with Their help, to undertake it,” I said.
“ Without Them I can do nothing. Only these Immaculate Ones
can show me where and how I can serve.”
“ You understand that you will be the target of evil powers?”
repeated the Voice, “ and that you must not complain, no matter
what befalls you?”
A shiver of fear passed through me, but I lifted my soul to
Christ and Mary and was able to answer:
“ I accept the task; I scarcely know what I am promising, for
the way lies dark before me, but if Christ asks me to work in
this field, I am ready. He will guide me, step by step, and Mary
will illumine me.”
The Voice said:
“ The conception of truth you are asked to spread, chiefly
through prayer, silently offered up whenever you meet someone
you can help, but also through speech and writing when necessary
—this conception is simple:
“ Marriage is a Sacrament. How, then, when we are asked to
give an account of our lives before our God, shall it fare with
those who have, in the slightest degree, bemeaned it into an
appetite? Should the sacramental nature of marriage cease, when
we leave the Altar, so that we forget to pray when we richly
love each other?
“ By what test,” continued the Voice, “ may we know when a
union has been spiritual rather than physical, when a religion
and not an appetite? The dividing line is so clear that the simplest
mind need not be left in doubt, but may know, with accurate
precision, when God has been remembered and when forgotten:
“ Those who are serenely refreshed by the marital act, being
made more ready to serve all men, everywhere, and to worship
God more fervently in Spirit and in Truth—these have been
joined together by God. Those who are exhausted, unbalanced
SEX 163
deteriorated, by the act, are joined, not by God who creates,
renews, but by Satan who destroys.
“ Those, then, who are ashamed to meet their fellow-men
after the marital act, may know that they are also hiding from their
God.
“ Those, on the contrary, who, unashamed, open-eyed, inno­
cent, are filled with a buoyant sweetness, radiated in pure delight
everywhere, to bless His neediest creatures—these holy lovers
may realize that they have risen above the sin of Adam and Eve
—the selfish, self-conscious passion of the crude savage—and are
entering the sphere where the Twain are made one by the Cross
(Ephesians ii).
“ Whenever, then, there is a reaction, so that body and soul sink
to a lower plane, lovers may know that they have sinned; for
God uses creative Power, not to destroy but to build.”
I returned home, and it seemed as though my difficulties
began at once. The duties I generally undertook in the early
morning had been neglected, and the house was in a state of
discord. To be plunged from the exalted state to which I had been
carried into this fretful, reproachful atmosphere seemed a down­
fall. But I put on my apron, and with a sweet new Influx pouring
through me, fulfilled my humble duties, realizing that an orderly
calm was restored far more quickly than was usual, when this
rather erratic household, which I was visiting, had fallen into
confusion.
HIS SCHEME
As the days passed there was an ever-growing desire to under­
stand mentally the Scheme of Christ. My reason was not set in
order, and so long as my thoughts were incoherent I could not
be quite at rest. I owned a great many new treasures, but they
seemed piled together in confusion, and to a reasoner such con­
fusion is as trying as discord is to a musician or jarring colour
to a painter.
As there are many others belonging to my clan, who are bound
to set their beliefs in logical order before they are entirely
satisfactory, I begged Christ to help me, saying to Him that I
would suffer any hardships, if I might be allowed to present
Bible truths in such a shape that those of us who cannot help our
logical instincts might be satisfied.
When I perceived how extraordinary, how divine, was the
mental capacity of Christ, I knew that His Book, the New Testa­
ment, must be logically accurate. He would not permit His
disciples to issue statements which were against reason. Yet it
had seemed to me that the New Testament, as analysed by the
Church, was quite unreasonable, as I had explained to the good
Bishop. It was not through obstinacy or ill-will, that I had
spoken to him as I had done; but it was through the same
instinct which forbids a mathematician to accept that two and
two make five.
The scheme of salvation, as presented by the Church, had
seemed to me to be mental chaos; but now a deeper insight began
to teach me that I was wrong in part, I felt things to be true,
which I could not explain with my reason. Yet God gave us our
reason not to plague us, but to serve us, and so I asked our Lord
to help me.
I gathered together a number of volumes, and began to study
with strenuous concentration. It was a delight to me to re-enter
the world of books, and I remembered how, in the days when my
eyes were useless, a pile of fresh literature on the library table
tempted me as a bone, out of reach, attracts a hungry dog. I
longed to read, and I could not. Now my student’s nature was
being satisfied and I was very happy.
HIS SCHEME 165
But after a few short days, I had a vision. I saw myself sur­
rounded by big volumes; above me stood the Image of Christ,
and He said to me: “ Close your books and learn of Me.” So
after nine bookless years, I was asked during six more years not
to read, and, even at the expiration of these fifteen years, I was
often commanded, for months at a time, not to open a book.
I saw, later, that this was a most wise injunction, difficult as
it seemed to be at the time, for it would have been almost impos­
sible to receive from the Voice, The Mediators, the book to which
I have now devoted more than forty years of my fife, or Duality;
Míale and Female created He them, the small volume on the same
lines, which is to precede it shortly, so I hope, written for those
who do not care to go into the details elaborated in the larger
volume. For had my brain been filled with all sorts of precon­
ceived theories, there would have been no clean sheets for my
wise, my Christ-instructed Guides to write upon.
A PROPHECY
One evening, after a hard day of manual work in my cousin’s
house, I lay upon a couch to rest a little. For my body, although
it had grown much stronger, was not robust, and hence I was
very tired.
Suddenly a Vision rose before me. I have often been asked to
explain how I see. If the questioner will explain to me how he
sees, how, on opening closed eyes, he may instantly perceive
every detail of a vast landscape—if he will make it clear to me
how, being a blank, he suddenly is filled with pictures, I will be
able to tell him how I see Visions. For the processes are identical,
except that the sights spiritually revealed are far more clearly
perceived, and are indelibly impressed on my memory. The
Vision I am now proceeding to describe was imprinted on my
bram m the year 1882, and it is now the year 1927, hence I saw
this Vision forty-five years ago; nevertheless, every detail of the
picture still stands before me more plainly than does the scene
physically mirrored on my eyes, as I gaze upon the blue Bay of
Haifa, St. Jean d’Acre, snow-capped Mount Hermon, the purple-
tinted valley of Kishon, the Carmel range, and the distant hills
of Galilee. This vast panorama, which ever fills me with delight,
has been spread before me daily, and is mysteriously pictured in
my two small eyes; yet, though I have gazed upon it admiringly
or years, the scene which gleamed before my vision forty-five
years ago, with a swift flash scarcely lasting a second— this
ethereal Vision is far more clearly imprinted on my brain than the
beautiful material scene in the beloved Holy Land:
I saw myself sitting on a rude little bench with no back, the
arms being so close together I had scarcely room to move my
elbows, and the seat so narrow that it was very uncomfortable.
e ore me, but a little to the left side, was a rock, and on it was
chained a terrible, writhing shape. The features were sharply
aquiline, and the dark, leathery skin was so tightly drawn that
the bones of the thin face seemed almost to pierce through it.
The contortions of the hissing mouth were dreadful to see.
The whole figure was horribly fleshless, mummy-like. Except
that the convulsed, straining movements, which sought to break
A PROPHECY 167
the chains, were fiercely strong, one would have imagined that so
parched a body could have no vitality. The life of this hideous
being was concentrated in the terrible eyes. Gleams so fierce
were shot at me from these eyes, that I shrank in fear, although
the body was firmly chained. I appealed to Heaven for protection,
and saw standing by my side a splendid angel. Tall, majestic,
virile, he looked down upon me with a commanding regard.
In his hands he held what I perceived to be the feather of an
eagle and the feather of a dove. These he handed to me in
alternation, and signed to me that I must write with them on
pages of the book I held in my hands, a book adorned with a
clasp. I perceived that he gave me the feather-pens again and
again and yet again; and that I continued to write, perseveringly,
for a very long time, scarcely looking up from my work, unless
forced to do so by the fierce movements of the fiend chained
close beside me, the glance of whose terrible eyes seemed to
pierce me, sometimes like swords. Then a thrill of fear ran
through me, and I almost forgot to write; but the angel ever bent
a little closer to give me a sense of protection and to recall me
to my task. I worked on and on, ever cramped by the narrow sides
of my rude seat, and shifting to find an easier pose on this backless
bench.
Presently the volume was full, and I fastened the clasp, on
which was written the word “ F i n i s .” The book seemed more
like a diary than a Philosophy. As soon as the clasp was fastened
I saw in the distance, approaching from the right, a procession.
The crowd advanced until I could distinguish the figures. At the
head marched Christ, holding in His hands an even Cross sur­
rounded by a Circle.
This Cross had been used by my cousin to symbolize a divine
matehood, as it was composed of oppositely placed lengths,
each as long as the other, typifying the equally important, but
totally different, missions of man and woman, surrounded by a
Circle, signifying an eternal bond. Christ approached the rock
where the evil one was chained, and held this Cross, the sign of
a holy matehood, before him. The rays which streamed from the
sacred symbol consumed the writhing Satan, and only a heap of
ashes remained.
When he had been exterminated, the group behind Christ
approached, and I saw that the procession was composed of
youths and maidens, dancing hand in hand; they were throwing
168 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
flowers in the air until it was filled with luminous, floating blos­
soms. As I looked, I was thrilled with a sense of colour and of
musical motion so ravishing that my own life seemed, by contrast,
a sterile desert.
I have often pondered over this vision. The rude, uncom­
fortable seat symbolized, I supposed, that I was to work out my
salvation in poverty. This has been literally fulfilled, for I have
had, at times, scarcely enough to eat, nor clothes enough to keep
me warm. My property was situated in America and in Palestine,
but through American “ graft” and Turkish trickery and treachery
I had lost a large portion of my income. Still, with my simple
habits, I would have had enough to make both ends meet had
not Christ told me to give away so much of it that I was left
almost in want. But He never allowed me to come quite to grief.
When I scarcely knew where the next day’s supplies were to
be found, they were always forthcoming; and when I wondered
whether I was to be turned into the street, a roof was always
provided, a humble one, sometimes, nevertheless a sufficient
shelter. I was away from home, and my family did not know of
my plight, for I felt I had no right to ask them to supply me with
funds for my charities. It was in these emergencies that the young
Scotchman, who was with us in Haifa, came to the rescue, on
more than one occasion. He, having dedicated his fortune to the
needs of his fellow-creatures, was led to help me.
The rude, narrow bench symbolized, perhaps, that my books
must be written under great difficulties. At any rate this has been
the case, for I have had to compose them, in the main, in the
midst of disturbing noise and subject to constant interruption,
writing when and where I can, sometimes bolstered up in bed
at five o’clock in the morning, because I had no other free and
uninterrupted time.
My literary neighbours, with their comfortable, quiet libraries,
can scarcely imagine how straining it has been to write a Philo­
sophy in a common sitting-room, with a piano going on either
side of me, and sometimes even an ear-piercing horn. Yet, when
I could find my Lord, He enclosed me in a sphere of perfect
stillness, where I could hear the faintest whisper of the Voice
which dictated the book I was seeking to write.
The Vision of Satan also corresponds with the experiences
which followed. He has been chained, for his fiercest wrath
has only helped and not harmed me, when I held fast to my
A PROPHECY 169
Saviour; hence, although he has attacked me virulently, at times,
that virulence has ever ended in impotence.
Whether in my books I have succeeded in using the feather-
pens of the eagle and the dove, handed me by the Angel, I do
not know. I can only say that I have tried to do so, realizing that
force and gentleness combined are most persuasive. Where I
have failed, it has been my own fault; where I have succeeded,
it is because I have been so potently helped.
But whatever result may have been achieved, I have had to
earn it. It is true that the Voice has dictated my books, and if
there is any good in them it has been given to me. But it was
never given, until I had overcome in a testing struggle. When
some hard fate had not been able to crush me, a torrent of
inspiration was vouchsafed, and I could scarcely write fast
enough. When I did not overcome, my stupid mind was a blank.
Thus, I have not been asked to evolve my books mentally, but to
earn the right to edit them by the sternest moral effort. Conception
after conception was thus wrested from the dark confusion which
hid from me the truth I was seeking, and for which I prayed in
order that logical minds could adore Christ, without the hindrance
of disturbing mental doubts.
I realized that the old religion was being shaken by new dis­
coveries of science, unsettled by fresh theories of philosophy;
but the task of reducing to order this contradictory confusion of
ideas through a personal mental effort, was utterly beyond me.
Even after I had seen the Vision of Christ on the Altar, I asked
myself, in puzzled doubt, where Jesus of Nazareth was to be
placed.
Had I seen the Nazarene, or some Being, Master of us all,
who had never been incarnated, I did not know. My soul was
satisfied, filled to overflowing, with the love I offered my Master,
but my mind was not yet at rest.
What is the mystery of The Trinity?
Could God leave His Throne and be incarnated on this small
earth, without peril to the rest of His Cosmos ?
What was the efficacy of Christ’s sacrifice on the Cross, and
under what law could it be offered in atonement? How could He
be both a glorious man and a glorious God?
How could sin, sorrow, Satan, hell, be explained and
utilized?
These and a thousand kindred questions surged through my
170 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
brain and tormented me, as they have tormented many another
questioner; and I pled with my Lord to instruct us.
I may here say that, in the end, my mind was set entirely at
rest. My brain worshipped Jesus of Nazareth, even as my soul
worshipped Him. No part of me was left unsatisfied, so that I
could adore our King, born at Bethlehem, with my whole being,
through a faith that nothing could shake. It has taken me more
than forty years to write the books which set my mind in order.
I was asked to exile myself from my people and my country; to
forgo all amusement, even fight reading; to shut myself off
from society—in short, to five the stern fife of a recluse, in order
that I might receive, without hindrances, the message contained
in The Mediators, and Duality: Male and Demale created He them,
and I am deeply thankful that I obeyed, for I am well repaid for
the sacrifice I was led to make.
CONFIRMATION
B ut, for the moment, no answer came to my mental queries.
I was led to fulfil the household duries I had taken on myself
in my cousin’s home, to walk about the streets until I was tired
out, seeking the divine in every face, and to go very often to
the “ Little Church around the Corner,” for the Voice said that
a prejudice against the Church had wound itself into my fibre,
and I must attend the daily services until I realized in how digni­
fied a manner the aspirations of generations of Christians were
voiced in its ritual.
I often went to early Communion, but, as I was not a member
of the Church, I did not again go to the Communion Table.
Presently the need to do so arose in me, and I asked for guidance.
I was turned to the third chapter of Jeremiah, where I found the
words, “ And I will give you pastors according to Mine heart.”
In looking up the paragraphs quoted in the margin, I found that
they pointed towards the need of a common worship, of a human
fellowship, in communing with God.
I went, therefore, to see the venerable pastor of the church,
for whom I now felt a warm affection and true esteem, and I put
my case before him.
“ I am not an orthodox Christian,” I said, “ and I do not know
that I ever shall be. My mind is in a state of confusion concerning
many of the beliefs of the Church, but I wish to come to Com­
munion. I have been baptized but not confirmed. Do you feel
that you can receive me under these circumstances ?”
He clasped his hands, and closed his eyes in prayer for a
moment. Then, turning to me, he said: “ Do you believe that you
could die for Christ’s sake?”
“ The best men living, His disciples, failed Him in His hour of
need,” I said, “ and I do not know what I should do, were I
tempted as they must have been. But so far as I know my own
heart, I believe that I love Christ better than myself, and therefore
would die for Him.” “ That is enough,” said this wise man.
“ The Bishop o f------” , naming a State near my native State, “ will
be here next week; he knows, I think, your family. Would you
like to be confirmed by him?”
172 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
“ Yes,” I said.
On the day set I was ill in bed with an ulcerated sore throat.
It was a very bad afternoon, a cold sleet was being driven through
the slippery streets by an icy wind; but I was led to rise, dress, and
go to the church.
The bishop and the pastor were in the church, and the latter
bound a veil, a square piece of muslin, on my head. I knelt alone,
in the dusk of the late afternoon, and was confirmed in the silent,
empty church, at the Altar where I had found my Lord. As I
rose, an elaborate bridal veil of lace suddenly floated before my
eyes, and, in vision, the simple muslin square was removed and
the lace veil adjusted by unseen hands.
The bishop, who knew my people well, gave me his benedic­
tion, and the pastor led me, with gentle courtesy, to the door of
the church.
I breasted the ever-increasing gale, and reached, at last, our
own door, petrified with cold. But I suffered no harm, for
my throat was much better the next morning, and I could
swallow solid food, which I had not been able to do for several
days.
From that time I went often to the early Communion Service,
at seven o clock in the morning, until, at last, I deeply loved the
Church and its services.
In the years which followed, I have sought in many cities for
a Sanctuary with a similar atmosphere, but I have rarely found
it. Hence, although my old prejudice has wholly disappeared,
I am more inclined to pray in my own home, where I seem to
be able to find my Saviour more easily. I love Him so passion-
ately, He is so real to me, that the formal atmosphere in many
churches pains me. It may be my fault, and it is not for me to
judge others, but I have tried again and again, and at times I
come home somewhat wearied and spiritually chilled, and must
make an effort to bring back His living Image, to find afresh the
Saviour whose glowing Love comforts and sustains me in every
trial.
In addition my brain was not satisfied, and my confusion
grew, as I studied the theories of the Church. The old lack of
reasonableness, which I had put before the kindly Bishop, still
disturbed me mentally, and I prayed afresh for more light to
guide me on my way in this long road leading from earth to
heaven, for God who has endowed us with reason will not
CONFIRMATION 173
punish us for using His Gift, when we do not belong to the
blessed ones who can win wisdom through faith alone.
This book is not a Philosophy, but I am venturing to give a
slight hint under the next heading as to the understanding
finally vouchsafed to me, an understanding put in its simplest,
shortest form in this volume. The fortunate Christian reader
who has no doubts does not need any explanation, hence this
contented believer may omit the next short chapter without loss
to himself or herself.

briefly, from the Philosophies, Duality and The Mediators, and
introduced herein as a forerunner to the detailed works which
are to be published presently.
As my questioning brain, trained from youth in an agnostical
atmosphere, is now set in order by these books, may I not hope
that the logical Plan of Life vouchsafed to me which fully satis­
fies my mind, may be of some use presently to the keenly logical
discernment of honest doubters whose intellects are not at rest
under present disturbing influences, even as my own intellect
was not at rest, until the Voice instructed me.
For many years, namely from 1882 up to the present, have I
set aside all other studies in order to be of some service to
earnestly searching agnostics, to Unitarians, and to unsettled
Christians, who desire to believe, by sharing with them the
understanding vouchsafed to me in my blind hours of mental
confusion, an understanding not won, most certainly, by any
wisdom of my own, but because I incessantly asked to be freed
from any obstinacies, inertia, misconceptions, or fanatical
hindrances lurking in my mind, and to be enlightened only from
Above. Namely, I asked to be flexible rather than hard-set.
This, most concisely put, is the explanation vouchsafed to me
by the Voice which guides me, given to help those of us for whom
belief is difficult, unless reason is satisfied. The two Philosophies
vouchsafed to me carefully elaborate the following presentation,
which is as shortly stated herein as is possible, without risking
obscurity:
A people believing in a glorious God (the fact of His Existence
being analysed in The Mediators') and knowing that humanity
is rising from an elemental savagery to reach its present develop­
ment-such thinkers must needs accept that a Mediator, a Trans­
former (to use the phraseology of the Electrician) must stand
between these two widely different extremes of Life, for the slow
savage would be annihilated by the Glory of the Creator, unless
How shall a changing, growing humanity, rising irom an ele­
mental savagery, step by step, “ stroke on stroke, come in direct
touch with an unchanging, an all-glorious Creator, throughout
this slow progress, a Creator immutably sustaining the Universe—
how may this need be met without the intervention of a divinely
gifted Intermediary, able most wisely to adapt God’s unbearable
Power with the subtlest sympathy to each changing, growing
human development?
Thus, he who believes in a perfect God must needs accept the
necessity of Mediation between this Perfection and a slowly
halting human imperfection quite unable to bear, as yet, God s
overwhelming Power. Seeing that even physical forces may
electrocute unprotected malefactors, how shall we endure an
unbearable Divinity stronger than any material forces can be,
without a Mediator between God and man, in order to protect
man, not from the wrath of God, but from the Love of God,
greater than man can now bear?
Many hours have I pondered and prayed over the seemingly
unfathomable Mystery of a Godhead, who is Three Persons in
One, so the Church claims.
Finally, after I had overcome in a difficult moral struggle, a
most simple explanation was vouchsafed to me:
The activities of this earth on which we live furnish us with
the only object-lessons, enabling us to trace our way, satisfactorily,
from this Effect back to the Cause creating it.
On this earth wherever successful construction is seen, three
processes are invariably observed: Men plan, embody the plan
made, and reap the result of this plan when embodied. These are
the three steps which are universally observed wherever builders
are successfully building.
May we not assume, therefore, that the Godhead is composed
of Three Persons differentiated through three Missions. The
First Person plans the Creation, the Second Person embodies
the Creation, and the Third Person brings to fruition the Plan
which has been embodied.

•n exPlain h°w Three Persons may move as One, a further
illustration may be used:
The Spirit, which is likened to water, proceeds from a Source
Creator’ conceiving Life; descends to a depth, through
the Mediator incarnating Life; and is urged again to find the
High original Source, through the Holy Ghost, utilizing Life by
ascending as a Fountain, rather than a solid Stream, in order to
find a place for each human droplet, in a sacred Fellowship.
The Stream of Life remains the same throughout, but the
Missions are totally different. For God remains in His High
Heaven; the Mediator descends to the lowest Life-line; and the
Holy Spirit urges all men to aspire, starting from this Life-line,
to the Altitude which they were born to reach, in order to become
perfect as their Father in Heaven is perfect, seeing that no aim
less than this flawless one warrants the introduction of a Creation
evolved by an Almighty Creator.
Colossal as is such a Plan, yet God, in His Mercy, has so simply
conceived His Immensities, that the smallest thinking creature
therein may compass His Universe, and yet adore, in humblest
gratitude, its boundless Grandeur.
Our own King, Jesus of Nazareth, has declared that He is not
t e equa o this primordial Triune Godhead, which was per­
fected, necessarily, before inhabited worlds could be safely
swung in space. Whereas He, our own Saviour, grew in Wisdom
an tature, and undertook His Work when He was made ready.
Nevertheless, the Task He assumed as our King is so un­
thinkable to us that no Love we can give our adorable Saviour
is enoug . or w en all men had forsaken Him, He measured the
depths to which the lowest criminal can fell, in contrast to High
Heaven, and realizing how great was the Task of helping all
sinners who chose to follow Him Heavenward, yet He accepted
it. In this sense does He bear our burdens, for He must descend
to our low level in order to protect us from God’s unbearable
Power, and most sympathetically to guide us Godward, by being
so intimately at one with us, as true Christians know, that He
must needs suffer with us, even as we suffer with our closest of kin.
We who help our fellow-creatures, feebly and at intervals,
are aware how weary we sometimes become in carrying the loads
of others; yet the effort we make is a feeble nothing compared
to His Effort for all mankind, everywhere and always?
“ TH E M ED IATO RS’ 177
As every human undertaking of a complex character best
succeeds wider a Head, is it difficult to believe that the earth
itself needs this supreme Master? And does it not follow
being our unerring Guide, confusion will persist until we obey
Him?
How, then, shall we love Him and serve Him strenuously
enough? By ever rising joyously, through His Help, when evi
has done its worst ! _ , ,
The fact that Jesus Christ has declared the Father to be greate
than Himself, even as the body is greater than the hand, althoug
both are one, this, His clear affirmation as to His own Status,
has no belittling influence on our lives: For no Service, no
Adoration, no Love we can offer Him is enough. So great is the
Effort which our Saviour daily makes for us, that it is beyond our
widest comprehension, a truth which a ceaseless prayer has
revealed to those who love Him with all their souls.
For is He not even greater as our voluntary Slave than He is
as our splendid King?
M
TWO VISIONS
A t this time two remarkable visions were vouchsafed to me.
I saw a steep hill, in shape like Mount Tabor, in the Plain of
Esdraelon. A number of people were clambering up the sides of
this cone, and among them were my cousin and myself. I was
dragging behind me a skeleton, whose bony hands clasped my
ankles, and she was playing, by the way, with a crown made of
some spurious metal. The crown often rolled away, and she
disappeared in search of it. I called her anxiously, for I loved my
cousin, and still love her, although I have never seen her since
the days when Jennie quoted her, among others, as being my
enemy.
She was much more highly gifted by nature than I was;
beautiful, charming, and possessing ready talents, so I pled
with her, in my Vision, to keep on the straight way which led
most directly to the Summit. Finally, she did not answer me,
and I lost sight of her altogether, as afterwards happened in real
life, and went on alone. Many, many days I seemed to toil over
the narrow path, which was so steep and rough at times that I
could make no progress, unless I called on my Lord, especially
as I was constantly hindered by the heavy skeleton, which I
dragged after me. As the way grew more and more difficult,
I saw many persons turn back to seek again the valley below;
until, at last, the solicitude on the eerie heights grew oppressive.
Again and again I was tempted to join the discouraged ones, who
were returning to the familiar amenities of the homelike valley,
because they found the upward way too steep, too lonely, and
too hard. But the Image of my Lord ever rose before me, and I
could not bear to fail Him, so I struggled on, sometimes moving
only inch by inch, for I was exhausted by the long effort of
climbing while so heavily burdened, so constantly hindered by the
skeleton fastened to me.
When I had gone a little more than half-way, a great Hand
unclasped the skeleton fingers, and I moved onward and upward
with a freer step, though still very slowly. At last, after what
seemed ages of toiling, I reached near to the summit, and there
I saw so small a group that I was astonished. Those who had
TWO VISIONS 179
persevered in climbing the Mount of Aspiration, seemed foot-sore
and weary, almost too exhausted to greet each other.
As they stretched their tired limbs on the grass, they were
suddenly roused by the appearance of Jesus Christ. He descended
from Heaven and stood among them. Then He rose again, and
drew them with Him, a transfigured Company.
He floated downward until the valley was reached, and
although those of the group who were nearest to Him veiled His
glory in part, yet the dwellers in the valley fled in fear, and casting
themselves on their faces, begged Him to withdraw His Splendour
for they could not bear it. On and on He went, sustaining the
helpless little group which surrounded Him with a mighty Power.
Wherever He made His way the affrighted crowds fell prone,
covering their eyes, so that they might not see Him. But when
He had passed, they rose again and lifted their hands in suppfica-
tion, until the whole world seemed to be praying that they might
be made ready, when He came again, to meet Him face to face.
Here and there someone was uplifted to join the company sur­
rounding our Saviour; but, in the main, the multitude seemed
to be preparing, earnestly, sincerely, devoutly, for the Second
Coming of the Lord, of which He had now given them an unmis­
takable warning.
The second Vision was of a homelier nature:
I saw a man whom I can only describe as a Christian gentleman
sitting in the foreground of the picture, shone on by a full light
which revealed clearly his spiritual nature.
He was tall, dignified, strong, and gentle, and above all, the
inclination of his shapely head betokened meekness. In his arms
he held a beautiful boy.
Years afterwards, when I saw the picture of the inspired boy,
Jesus, in the Carpenter’s shop of St. Joseph, holding the three
nails in His hands, I said to myself: “ It is the likeness of some­
one I have seen,” for the face was perfectly familiar to me. The
next instant I realized that the beautiful boy, Jesus, was almost
exactly like the boy in my Vision, except that he, the vision-
child, was a little fairer, more of the Saxon type. I was sitting in
the background in a somewhat dim light, and in my arms was a
little girl of an entirely different contour. The face was of an
exquisite oval, the head small, the luminous eyes rather ar ,
and the hair, plaited in two strands, almost black. Her who e
i Bo M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
slender body seemed to embody rhythmic motion, and she was
so perfectly poised as scarcely to have any weight. She looked
a little like the best pictures of Alice Oliphant, but much more
beautiful, or rather much more living.
When I had clearly seen these details, the picture faded away
but it has remained indelibly impressed on my memory, these two
chi dren being more accurately imprinted on my brain than any
children, in the flesh, that I have seen. The features of the gentle-
man were not plain, but those of the children were distinct
That mght, when I knelt in prayer, these two blessed ones
seemed to kneel beside me, one on either side, and so real were
they that when a little breeze came from the open window I
involuntarily spread out my dressing-gown to protect them from
the draught.
I have a dread of empty and useless fancies, for I have seen
many lives disturbed by some hallucination among people with
whom I came in contact through my father’s researches. I feared

sane, whofly normai; and, if possible, to give me some rule by
which I might divide useful from useless visions.
The Voice answered, “ Wherever a picture set before you urges

and moral you need not be afraid that it is from Satan. When a
vision feeds your vanity, without asking for renewed exertion,

should these precious treasures be given to you, not when you
desire them, but when God sees fit to give them to you. Prepare
yourself for a holy motherhood, and, when you are ready, whether
it be in this incarnation or the next, you may be sure that God will
give you your reward the instant you have won the right to it.
And what we say to you, we say to each man or woman who
reads this book. The most important work in this world is the
preparation to bear holy children, conceived not in sin and iniquity
but in a sacred purity. This is the crying need, this the means of
salvation.
“ Therefore,” said the Voice to me, “ do not be afraid lovingly
to realize the presence of these children, provided, in the next
instant, you help Mary the cook with a more capable energy,
because of your holy hope. And do not refuse to be thrilled by
your love for them, if you are willing to wait a century if need be,
before you clasp them in your physical arms. This is the patience
of the saints: to work in the present instant with the minutest
care, even when you know that the fruit of this labour will not
be given to you for a thousand years.”
As the Voice spoke, my soul seemed almost over-strained in
the effort to understand such perseverance.
I could only gather from these Visions that God held in store
for me a blessed realization. That He meant to give me a husband
who would satisfy my highest needs, would fill my purest ideal,
and children crowning us with delight; but when and where I
did not know. I realized that I might have to wait until I was
again incarnated. And it was well that I did not ask for a swift

so perfectly poised as scarcely to have any weight. She looked
a little like the best pictures of Alice Oliphant, but much more
beautiful, or rather much more living.
When I had clearly seen these details, the picture faded away,
but it has remained indelibly impressed on my memory, these two
children being more accurately imprinted on my brain than any
children, in the flesh, that I have seen. The features of the gentle­
man were not plain, but those of the children were distinct.
That night, when I knelt in prayer, these two blessed ones
seemed to kneel beside me, one on either side, and so real were
they that when a little breeze came from the open window I
involuntarily spread out my dressing-gown to protect them from
the draught.
I have a dread of empty and useless fancies, for I have seen
many lives disturbed by some hallucination among people with
whom I came in contact through my father’s researches. I feared
the strange presence of these two beautiful children might be
an impression belonging to the category I had always disliked
and avoided.
So I knelt down again and begged Christ to keep me perfectly
sane, wholly normal; and, if possible, to give me some rule by
which I might divide useful from useless visions.
The Voice answered, “ Wherever a picture set before you urges
you to harder work, to a more incessant effort, physical, mental,
and moral, you need not be afraid that it is from Satan. When a
vision feeds your vanity, without asking for renewed exertion,
you must be careful not to accept it with blind confidence.
Were you to believe that you might become the mother of
these children, in this incarnation or the next, and were you to
accept that the stately Christian gentleman is your mate, whom
you will meet in God s good time, your consummation being
delayed possibly until your next life, would you grow more
supine or more energetic? Would you take to dreaming or to
hard, tedious work?”
“ I should labour until I could do no more, if I thought I could
earn, by this most strenuous effort, the right to be the mother of
such children,” I said.
“ In that case,” replied the Voice, “ it cannot harm you to
cradle these blessed little ones in your soul, patiently waiting until
they can be placed in your arms, provided you do not complain
TWO VISIONS 181
should these precious treasures be given to you, not when you
desire them, but when God sees fit to give them to you. Prepare
yourself for a holy motherhood, and, when you are ready, whether
it be in this incarnation or the next, you may be sure that God will

who would satisfy my highest needs, would fill my purest ideal,
and children crowning us with delight; but when and where I
did not know. I realized that I might have to wait until I was
again incarnated. And it was well that I did not ask for a swift
consummation, for a long and an almost incomprehensible period
of waiting lay before me, when I was asked, not to be queen in
my own home, but to serve, not only once but twice, as the hand­
maid of other women. Puzzling was my destiny to be, strange
its developments, and endlessly long the expectant years of
waiting. Had I not walked with my hand in His, guided step by
step through His patient Wisdom, I should have been certain to
fail, for I scarcely understood where I was being led and what
was the aim I was asked to keep before me. So many detours
were made, that I almost forgot there was a main road leading
to a fixed goal.
But I understood that in each hour there was a certain step He
wished me to take, and my simple duty was to take it, not asking
whither it led.
1 82 M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
Though a fully blessed matehood might not be vouchsafed
to me until my next incarnation, because I am not ready, yet must
I strive to do perfectly each smallest task, in each moment, with
as precise a care as though my consummation were coming on
the morrow. This, so the Voice ever repeated, is the rectitude,
the patience, and the perseverance asked of those who truly
serve Him. Above all, I was told never to cease from praying
for my mate, and though my prayers remained without answer
during a lifetime, still must I ever continue to sustain him,
through uplifting messages of courage, faith, hope, joy; for if
wireless physical messages can be sent, cannot wireless spirit
messages also be sent? Is the soul more confined in its radiations
than is the body?
This advice was given not only to me, but to every man and
woman who is ready to receive it, for each has an answering self,
created for him or her from the Beginning, but union with the
Creator must ever precede a true union, spirit-pure, with the
created.
In the days following the Vision of my stately mate and the
two holy children, this, then, was the next step clearly shown to
me: I was asked to go as often as the household duties I assumed
permitted it, to the Church of the Transfiguration and, kneeling
upon the Altar in the empty church, to pray for my mate, for
my other half made for me by God from the Beginning, so that
we twain could faithfully copy His Dual Image, male and female,
even as all other mates are asked to copy the Father-Mother.
Where he was, who he was, or how soon he would come—
whether, indeed, he would come in this fife at all, I did not
know, I only knew I was asked to pray for him, and prayer is
always of use, wherever and whoever its object may be. Hence,
I was able to appeal to Heaven sincerely and deeply for this
unknown answering self, and I knew that my appeal was not a
wasted effort, even as similar prayers offered by every solitary
man or woman on earth are not wasted efforts, as each has his
or her Counterpart made blessedly ready, at last, by the dual
Creator. Every living creature who is at all developed knows this
to be true; each knows, no matter how heroically self-sustaining
he or she may seem to be, each knows that a solitary fife is a
bereft, a yearning incompleteness. But, so says the Voice, the
consummations awaiting us may be long deferred, for only the
TWO VISIONS 183
soul which can endure through length of time is fitted for
eternity, the eternity insured through the faultlessly answering
spirit-poise of a perfected duality, the only fife-motion able to
insure a wasteless continuity by giving all things, and yet losing
nothing, a Law suggested in detail in The Mediators and Duality:
Male arid Female created He them.
One day as I knelt at the Altar, I was asked to make a three­
fold vow :
Togive, toforgive, and to believe.
Years afterwards, when I seemed to feel that my Lord was,
perhaps, a little satisfied with the way I had sought, through
Him, to keep these three vows, and I was asked what I desired
in return, my answer was unhesitating.
“ I desire to be sane; hence I pray for the meekness which
enables God to enter and to take full possession, so that He may
radiate His love through me, unhindered, to all whom it may
serve.9
9
This is sanity, thus may the only true fife be won; for, beyond
question, His and not mine is the glory.
We are helpless, that is the truth; so it is an utter waste of time
to imagine that one is, in the slightest degree, self-sufficient.
If one places one’s ideals high enough, one will soon become
persuaded of this fact; for one seeks in vain, after endless trials,
to reach unaided His lofty Summits.
All who have striven strenuously during the centuries, have
found, in common, this verity.
PUBLIC LIFE
My cousin decided, at this time, to join her mother, my aunt, in
England, and asked me to accompany her for a short visit. I
wrote to my home, and found the children could spare me for a
little longer, and indeed I felt that my brother’s new wife could
take her position better, if, for a time, she was sole mistress. This
had been one of my reasons for leaving my brother’s home to
visit my cousin for a season.
When I had been in London for some weeks, my aunt came
to my room after I had gone to bed.
Rosamond, she said, “ I have promised that you will address
a meeting in ------Hall next Sunday evening.”
I sat up in startled surprise. “ You must cancel the engagement,”
I said, for I cannot speak. I have no talent and no inclination
for public speaking. Why did you make such a promise without
consulting me, Aunt Frances?”
“ Because I believe that you have a mission, and I knew that
you would never speak in public unless you were forced on to
the platform.”
I cannot speak, I reiterated emphatically, “ you must write
to-morrow morning and cancel the engagement.”
That is impossible,” said my aunt, “ for I have permitted the
Committee to advertise the meeting in to-morrow’s papers and
the hall is engaged.”
I was much disturbed, but felt it was useless to protest.
I will go with you,” said my aunt, “ and help you as much
as I can. I am sure you are meant to speak in public.”
My aunt was called away to a daughter who was ill; the lady
she asked to take her place fell and injured her knee, so she could
not accompany me; and on the night fixed I made my way to the
hall alone.
I had never spoken in public, except at informal little meetings
in our village, and I was paralysed with fear. I found a small
company assembled in the hall, and was escorted to the platform
by the Chairman. During the week I had been in such a state of
nervousness that I had not been able to gather my wits, and when
I stood up before my audience, I looked at them in blank despair,
PUBLIC LIFE 185
for I seemed to have nothing to say. I sent up a prayer to my Lord
to help me, as I did not wish quite to disappoint the little company
of people who had made their way, on a very inclement night,
to the hall. , ,
I spoke for about half an hour, feeling horribly awkward
and scarcely knowing what I said, and then sat down thinking,
“ Well, I am such a disappointment, they will never ask me again,
that is one comfort.” _
To my great surprise, a dignified-looking man, with a long
white beard, rose in the audience and said, ‘ I came into this room
an unbeliever and I go out of it a believer. I thank Miss Dale
Owen with all my heart.”
A young man then rose, of a fine type; he resembled the
conception I had formed of Adam Bede. He said: “ I may repeat
the words of the gentleman who has just sat down; for, like him,
I came into this place an unbeliever and I go out of it a believer.
I also am deeply grateful to the young lady who has had so great
an influence upon me.”
I looked at these two men in amazement, for it seemed impos­
sible that my poor attempt could have had so great a result.
The Chairman then begged me to speak again on the following
week. I asked him to be good enough to allow me a night for
reflection before I gave him my answer.
“ Certainly,” he said, “ but I trust you will consent, everyone
will be disappointed if you refuse.
I tossed about in my bed, rather an unhappy mortal, for the
greater part of the night. I seemed to have almost a horror of
appearing on a platform, and yet if I could help such men as had
spoken at the meeting, had I a right to refuse?
The next morning I wrote saying I would speak again; for
I felt if I did not, it would be because I was a coward.
At the next meeting the hall was crowded, and I managed to
speak a little better than on the first night. The following morning
there were several notices of the speech, and a few days later I
had a letter from Newcastle asking me to address a meeting there.
I was filled with consternation on reaching Newcastle to see
my name staring at me from great posters and to find that a
very large hall had been engaged.
I said to the members of the Committee who had met me at
the station, and were in the carriage:
“ Why have you taken------Hall? I am not a trained speaker,
w x iu hpcaK, scanning on a large platform intended,
evidently, for an orchestra, I was paralysed with fear. I did not
even know how to manage my voice in so big a building, and I
felt it was not reaching the back of the hall. It seemed impossible
to think, and my only desire was to escape from the spacious
p atform, where I seemed lost, and to hide myself somewhere in
a little corner.
Why had my aunt put me in this painful position and prepared
a disappointment for all these people?
This thought roused me. Believing in Him, had I a right to
disappoint them? The faces turned up to me seemed to be asking
me for help. Was I so filled with idiotic self-consciousness that
I could not think of them and their needs?
I felt thoroughly ashamed of myself, and sent up a cry to my
Lord not to let me fail, not to let me miss the opportunity of
being of some use to my fellow-creatures. But I was so ill at ease
m my unaccustomed position that I was not able to overcome
fully. I felt when I sat down that the audience was disappointed,
and I was very sorry. When the members of the Committee
surrounded me, after the meeting, I realized that they were
chagrined.
I apologized to them, and begged to be left alone during the
afternoon so that I could prepare myself for the meeting to be
held that night. I prayed without ceasing, and fasted, taking
nothing to eat nor drink. In the evening the hall was crowded,
the platform filled to overflowing, and I did not cease praying
until, throwing myself wholly on His mercy, I rose to speak.
I felt that He sustained me. My voice filled the hall, the words
came to me, a new instinct seemed to be given to me, the instinct
of the scene painter who produces broad effects for a large
audience. °
There was a certain thrill of pleasure as I began to realize that
I held this great crowd in my grasp, every face being eagerly,
intently, turned to me. It was like playing on a splendid organ,
where two slender hands may fill a vast responding dome with
music. The intoxication of the orator was revealed to me, and yet
I still felt out of place. I could not picture the Virgin Mary in my
stand where i was standing, rarner man a wuman o, — - -
would have been far better employed had I silently, prayerfully,
helped some splendid man to speak, as useful as he (for prayer
is as important as labour), nevertheless sitting behind him
unobserved. Throughout the year and a half that I spoke in public
this instinct persisted. Always, when I sat in the waiting-room and
heard the audience crowding into the hall, my heart sank with
fear; and always, when I stood on the platform, I felt it to be
too prominent a place for a woman.
Had I been an actress, or a singer, sheltered behind my art,
veiled by the character I had assumed, helped to forget myself
through the scenery and music which surrounded me, I mig t
have felt differently. I do not know. But as a public speaker I never
was comfortable; possibly one reason is that I am not an orator,
this noble gift has not been given to me, and it may be that women
to whom it has been vouchsafed have a right to feel at ease. 1
once spoke after hearing Annie Besant, and I was filled with
admiration, realizing how crude was my own effort. And yet,
imperfect as I was, the audience answered to my touch as it did
not respond to other far more gifted speakers, and I suppose the
reason to be that I entreated Christ to set me aside altogether an
to speak through me unhindered.
At Newcastle, when the evening meeting was over, the plat­
form was thronged, and I had great difficulty in gettmg away
from the eager crowd desiring to shake hands with me.
The next morning I found two or three newspapers at my
place when I came down to breakfast. I turned them over to
see whether there was a small notice of the meeting in some
corner, and finding nothing, opened the main page to read the
editorials. To my amazement, I found they were written about
me, praising my effort. A few moments after a number of people

pleased with the lecture. I went out later on some errands, and
my name stared at me from the newspaper posters. When I
had made my purchases I gave my address to have the things sent
to the hotel, and the owner of the shop made a profound bow
saying: “ Madam, Newcastle is ringing with that name.”
i86 M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
and I fear I shall fail. I had no idea the meeting was organized
on such a scale.” °
Evidently my companions were taken aback, and I was sorry
I had made them uneasy.
When I rose to speak, standing on a large platform intended,
evidently, for an orchestra, I was paralysed with fear. I did not
even know how to manage my voice in so big a building, and I

position, I could not think of Her, who silently pondered so many
things, standing in the bold relief of a platform. I could not
imagine Her gentle voice being raised as mine was forced to be,
in order that I might be heard. I felt that it was a man’s right to
stand where I was standing, rather than a woman s; and that I
would have been far better employed had I silently, prayerfully,
helped some splendid man to speak, as useful as he (for prayer

i was very much astomshed to find that I had suddenly become
famous, and a good deal amused, for I was tolerably certain that
I was not an orator and that it would not last. But I was very
thankful that the working men who had organized the meetings
had not been disappointed and were not out of pocket. I spoke
eight times during the week, and when I returned to London I
looked so ill that my aunt was dismayed. The strain had been
too much for me.
I was obliged, however, to go on, for invitations to address
meetings came from all sides; and, by degrees, I began to see
why I had been led to speak. My audiences, in the main, were
composed of the followers of my father, Robert Dale Owen,
and my grandfather, Robert Owen. The former were, for the
most part, searchers after truth through spiritualism; and the
latter agnostics and the more reasonable class of socialists
believing in co-operation. I presently fell into the way of giving
a short lecture, and then holding conversations with my audiences.
In this way I heard from thousands of lips the doubts and diffi­
culties which had driven these questioners out of the Church,
and this was the best possible preparation for my work. I knew
what good and intelligent men and women were asking; I real­
ized, through meeting after meeting, where were the stumbling-
blocks, and I was very thankful to be thus helped in writing my
books. As I myself had been hindered in accepting the Creed of
the Church, as these men and women were hindered, I could
fully sympathize with them. Many of their questions I could not
then answer, but as my book developed I felt that the doubts of
the reasonable and unprejudiced minds in my audiences could
be satisfactorily solved in the main.
On one occasion, when I was speaking in a large city to
spiritualists, a number of persons belonging to a Christian Sect
made their way into the hall and tried to break up the meeting.
The afternoon gathering ended in confusion, but I was determined
that this should not happen again when I spoke in the evening;
for those who had engaged me had paid the expenses of the
meeting, many of them out of hard-earned money, and it did not
seem just to interfere with their rights.
So I ordered, from the platform, that each person who
broke the peace should be carried out of the hall by those on
either side of them. After several persons had been ejected
quiet was restored, and the members of the disturbing con­
tingent who remained finished by listening attenuveiy *uu
^ T w ^ h o w e v e r , exhausted. A number of people followed
me to the home where I was staying, and remained until midnight;
several persons awaited me when I came down to breakfast,
wishing to make a confession of some sin; and when I took the
train to the next town, where I was to speak that evening, two
or three people accompanied me and kept me talking all the way.
At the other end of my journey I was met by a company ot
persons, and had not a moment to myself until I stepped on to
the platform. My voice was gone, my strength had ebbed away,

The hall was packed, and I cried to my Lord for help. When 1
had finished the message vouchsafed to me, a Unitarian hymn was
sung, a prayer offered up, and the audience was dismissed But
not a soul stirred. The Chairman turned to me and said: They
won’t go, what shall I do?” I said, “ Sing again.” He gave out
another hymn, and still the audience remained in their seats.
Several times he dismissed them, but his voice seemed to tall on
deaf ears. It was a strange sight, this motionless, entrance
company. Many of them sat with closed eyes, others looked at
me as though fascinated, and still no one stirred. Again we sang
and still they remained. „ .,

between eighteen and twenty. One of them stepped forward
and said: “ May I shake hands with you, for your touch will mate
me a better man all my life.” The others then advanced and 1
shook hands with them all.
I afterwards asked a venerable old man why the audience
remained after the Chairman had dismissed the people.

at peace, and I did not wish to break the blessed spell. I have
never before felt so near heaven.” ,

1 88 M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
I was very much astonished to find that I had suddenly become
famous, and a good deal amused, for I was tolerably certain that
I was not an orator and that it would not last. But I was very
thankful that the working men who had organized the meetings
had not been disappointed and were not out of pocket. I spoke
eight times during the week, and when I returned to London I
looked so ill that my aunt was dismayed. The strain had been
too much for me.
I was obliged, however, to go on, for invitations to address
meetings came from all sides; and, by degrees, I began to see
why I had been led to speak. My audiences, in the main, were
composed of the followers of my father, Robert Dale Owen,
and my grandfather, Robert Owen. The former were, for the
most part, searchers after truth through spiritualism; and the
latter agnostics and the more reasonable class of socialists
believing in co-operation. I presently fell into the way of giving
a short lecture, and then holding conversations with my audiences.
In this way I heard from thousands of lips the doubts and diffi­
culties which had driven these questioners out of the Church,
and this was the best possible preparation for my work. I knew
what good and intelligent men and women were asking; I real­
ized, through meeting after meeting, where were the stumbling-
blocks, and I was very thankful to be thus helped in writing my
books. As I myself had been hindered in accepting the Creed of
the Church, as these men and women were hindered, I could
fully sympathize with them. Many of their questions I could not
then answer, but as my book developed I felt that the doubts of
the reasonable and unprejudiced minds in my audiences could
be satisfactorily solved in the main.
On one occasion, when I was speaking in a large city to
spiritualists, a number of persons belonging to a Christian Sect
made their way into the hall and tried to break up the meeting.
The afternoon gathering ended in confusion, but I was determined
that this should not happen again when I spoke in the evening;
for those who had engaged me had paid the expenses of the
meeting, many of them out of hard-earned money, and it did not
seem just to interfere with their rights.
So I ordered, from the platform, that each person who
broke the peace should be carried out of the hall by those on
either side of them. After several persons had been ejected
quiet was restored, and the members of the disturbing con-
PUBLIC LIFE 189
tingent who remained finished by listening attentively and
T ^ f h o w e v e r , exhausted. A number of people followed
me to the homewhere I was staying, and remained unul m dm ght,
“ veral persons awaited me when I eame down to breakfast,
wishing^o make a confession of some sin; and when I took the
train to the next town, where I was to speak that evening,
or three people accompanied me and kept me talking all the way.
At M o th er end of my journey I was met by a company of
persons, and had not a moment to myself until I stepped on
the platform. My voice was gone, my strength had ebbed away,
untiH felt that there was no fife in me; I was blmd with fatigue.

I had the same experience on one or two occasions afterwards,
and it was always when, in my own strength, I could do nothing.
The next night I spoke at a town twelve miles distant; when
the crowd on the platform, desiring to shake hands with me after
the meeting, had thinned a little, I perceived a young woman with
a baby in her arms, standing on the floor of the hall close to the
platform. I stepped to the edge to speak to her, as I recalled that
she had been patiently waiting in the same spot for some time.
She raised her eyes to mine and said simply, “ I love you,”
then turned to go. I called her back, and she told me that she had
heard me speak the night before, and had walked twelve miles,
carrying her child, to hear me again.
“ Are you going back to-night?” I asked.
“ Yes, I must be back at work early in the m orning.”
“ Then let me send you in a conveyance,” I said, “ your child
is heavy, it is late, and you have a long walk before you.”
“ No,” she said, “ I will walk; it has paid me to come.”

I said to my hearers that I had not seen my grandfather since
I was six years old, and hence did not remember him clearly,

buried with him. I was deeply touched, for it is a wonderful
thing to be so beloved years after one’s death. Those who
remembered the old days seemed to think that New Lanark had
been a little paradise. Looking down from Heaven, where
money is of no value, surely Robert Owen rejoices that he
generously helped his fellow-creatures, instead of hoarding his
wealth, and we who might have been rich heirs and instead have
been strugglers like the rest of working humanity—we have no
right to complain that he, having an income of forty thousand
pounds a year, died without forty shillings in his pocket. My
father, who was with my grandfather when he died, told me
that when his limbs were cold and his breath leaving him, he
was still planning, with an irrepressible enthusiasm, to hold a
great meeting, wherein he hoped to be of use to his fellow-
creatures. His love for humanity was stronger than death.
TH E SLUMS
On one occasion a working man came up to me after a crowded
meeting in a central London hall. He asked me if I would speak
to some people he was trying to help. I consented, and he arranged
to meet me at a certain station and to take me to the meeting.
On leaving the station we climbed into an omnibus and went
some distance into an ever meaner district, which was not known
to me Finally we alighted and walked through some slums filled
with very rough-looking people. I began to get nervous as the
jostling crowds grew ever more uncivilized, and I reflected that
I did not at all know my conductor. However, there was no^ n°
escape, so I followed his tall, sturdy figure, keeping close behind
Presently we halted, and entered a room filled with rough
benches. At the far end was a large packing-box which served as
a platform. My conductor helped me to clamber on this box an
gave me a rickety chair; then, sticking a few lighted candles in
empty bottles here and there, he went outside, and I heard him
speaking to the passers-by. When he had gathered a crowd, he
invited them to come into the room and hear me. They troope
in and filled the benches. Then he ascended the box by my side,
introduced me to the audience, and asked me to speak.
A shiver of fear passed through me as the Voice suddenly said
to me, “ Speak to them of sex purity.” I looked at the coarse,
rough faces before me, the men wearing dirty caps which t ey
had not removed, and the dishevelled women with shawls over
their heads.
How was I to speak of sex purity to these dirty dwellers in t e
slums? Surely I would be grossly insulted.
“ Remember your vow,” said the Voice.
I began in a low, faltering tone, but soon gained courage.
After I had spoken a few minutes, a young man who seemed
half-drunk shouted something at me; but my conductor rose an
thundered sternly, “ Silence.” During the rest of the t e
audience listened respectfully and with close attention.
I described to them the meeting of two lovers, I traced them
through their courtship, their marriage, their parentage, t eir
N
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
194
old age. I showed them how at each advance these two, who
loved one another, either grew better, happier, and nearer to
God, and hence more lover-like; or else deteriorated, step by
step, forgetting at last all the sweetness of the early days. I
spoke to them of the difference between a prayerful marriage
bond and a lustful one; and, finally, with a power which was
rarely given to me, I described to them the exquisite beauty
of a holy love, which could turn the poorest home into a
paradise.
When I had finished, every face was turned to me, and in many
of them I could trace a dumb longing for better things. The
Chairman, if a man perched on a rough box may be called a
Chairman, closed the meeting with a simple prayer and a hymn.
As we left the room many hands were stretched out to me, and
a fervent “ God bless you ” was pronounced by many lips.
A great gratitude filled me as we made our way back, for I
realized that deep down, even in the coarsest hearts, our God
speaks.
Pure love is so beautiful, and lust is so hateful, that even
the commonest can be made to desire the clean stream instead
of the sewer. The response to my appeal that night had astonished
me, I had clearly been shown how irresistible is our Eternal God.
Where He moves, who shall withstand Him in the end; and He
moves wherever one spark of true love exists. Even in these
coarse faces had I seen that He cannot be quite forgotten by the
creatures He has created.
I was speaking the next week in a town near the borders of
Scotland. I had scarcely been able to make my way into the hall,
there was such a crowd within and without the building. But
when we returned from the evening meeting, the company which,
as usual, followed me to the house of my host, sat around the
fire-place in what seemed to me an almost surly silence. I was
desperately tired and scarcely felt able to dispel the gloom
which seemed to have settled down on the company.
Still I made the attempt, but no one appeared to respond, and
I relapsed into silence, fearing that I had been a dismal failure
and that everyone was sorely disappointed. Being aware that
I had not the gift of oratory, I always knew that if I did not pray
profoundly enough I was bound to fail, as I feared I had failed
that night; and I reproached myself sharply for not having sought
my Lord as I ought to have done.
TH E SLUMS r9

What, then, was my astonishment when, at last, my host said:
“ I’ve heard John Bright and Gladstone and most of the big
speakers, but I never heard anyone yet I liked as well as yon lass
to-night,” and he jerked his thumb in my direction without
l0<“ Aye aye,” assented the others, and again fell into solemn
meditation. Presently a splendid specim en of manhood rose
and walking about the room said: “ She’s tired out and looks
ready to faint, and here am I with strength enough for ten. It s
a pity I can’t give it all to her, which I’d be most willing to do
if I could, for she can do a lot more good with it than ever I
can. Is there no way I can help you?” he asked, looking down at
me wistfully. “ I can think of nothing to rest you a bit, unless
you would like us to sing to you.” „
“ Please do,” I said, “ it would refresh me, I am sure.
They sang two or three songs with their fine, strong voices,
and I felt much better. ,
“ Your wish has been heard,” I said gratefully, for you have
given me a wonderful strength. I feel like a new woman, and I
thank you all.”
I was deeply touched by the devotion of these big, strong sons
of the North, who said so little and felt so much; and as long as
I dwelt among them, I was aware of the sustaining power o
their reverent affection.
Often I saw persons in tears in my audience, and wondered
at it, especially when there was nothing whatever in t e ecture
of a sad character. c ,
On one occasion I saw my host with his handkerchief pressed
to his eyes, and evidently deeply moved. He was a reserve ,
well-balanced man, not in the least hysterical, and as e mys
why he and others were brought to tears without any apparen
reason. Englishmen, as a rule, are not given to crying in
public. , ,
I ventured to question him when we returned to t e °us<-,
in order to discover why he and others were so deep y a ec e .
“ I do not know how others feel, but I think every sin eve
committed rose before me, and I was filled with so eep a remo
I could scarcely control myself. You seemed to be searc ng
every weakness in me.” *
“ Believe me,” I said, “ it was not I, for I must make so much
x96 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
effort to overcome my own sins, I have no time nor inclination
to judge others. But I ever pray the Lord to make me as useful
to my fellow-creatures as it is possible for me to be, and He hears
my prayer. It seems to me, unless we offer up this petition we
have no right to take up the time and claim the attention of an
audience, for without Him how shall one small person usefully
influence a thousand.”
My plan had been to win the affection of my audiences and
then to speak to them of my faith in Christ. After the lectures,
I had sought, whenever it was possible, to lead the conversations
which followed into a religious channel, asking my auditors to
tell me of their doubts and difficulties, but I had listened rather
than taught during these talks.
I felt at the end of a year and a half that I might venture to
speak of my faith, with some hope of success; although other
speakers warned me that those who rejected Christ in my audi­
ences—and they were in the majority, being either Unitarians
or Agnostics—might insult me, if I sought to lead them to
Him.
As this was my sole aim from the beginning, I felt that I
must make the attempt, no matter what the result might be.
I was scarcely prepared, however, for the resistance I encoun­
tered. Those who had seemed so pliable to my touch when I
spoke of temperance, education, hygiene, social problems, my
spiritualistic experiences, etc.— these same audiences presented
fronts of steel when I began to speak to them of Christ.
After the first lecture the drawing-room of my hostess was
crowded, and the company following me from the hall belaboured
me until midnight; the same company that had lavished praise
on me a few weeks before.
The next morning I received a letter containing about ten
large pages of abuse, and only a few missives reached me of a
sympathetic character. When I had finished the two or three
lectures I had engaged to give, there was not a single invitation to
speak.
This experience intensified my desire to get to work at my
books, and I besought my Lord to give me an understanding of
His Scheme which would wholly satisfy these people and myself.
I did not blame them for the attitude they assumed, for I might
have done the same a few short years before; and, indeed, I
TH E SLUMS i 97
realized that I was not at all prepared to address the keen,
analytical minds in my audiences, when my own brain was still
in confusion.
So I was most thankful that I was no longer called on to speak,
and retired into private life with grateful pleasure.
A H O LIDAY
I th en left England and returned to America. When I reached
New York I found an invitation to speak in the South, and I
reluctantly accepted it. When I arrived at the station there was
no one to meet me, as had been arranged, and I found that my
host lived some miles away. A feeling of uneasiness came over
me as the negro drivers crowded around me, I being the only
passenger who had alighted, for it was a small station.
It was growing dusk, and it seemed best not to wait any longer,
so I engaged a carriage, and as I stepped into it the Voice said:
“ You will find an evfen Cross in your bedroom, which will be
a sign that you have done right in coming here. God sent you.”
I met my host half-way, and with many apologies for being
late he accompanied me to his home.
It was a large, rambling building situated on a range of high
hills and surrounded by pine woods.
The daughter of my host was the mistress of the place, and
she met me with evident dismay, as cleaning was going on and
the house was upside down, my room not being ready; I heard
her presently, in the next room, reproaching her father tearfully
and angrily for bringing “ another disagreeable woman into the
house without notice.” I was a good deal disturbed when I heard
this altercation through a thin partition, but when, a few moments
later, a negro ushered me to my hastily prepared apartment, a
large even Cross, embroidered in red silks on a cushion, met my
eye as I entered. So I was reassured.
When I had settled down in my new home, I realized that I
was thoroughly exhausted, but I had come for a purpose, so I
rallied my forces and asked my host to inform me concerning
the meetings he had organized. It seems he had made no arrange­
ments of any kind, and begged me to remain as their guest for
some time, until he could find a suitable hall. As there seemed to
be none which could be engaged in the village, I scarcely knew
how he was going to manage. However, as the daughter had now
become my warm friend and also begged me to remain, saying
they were only too glad to have me, I settled down in a hammock
swung between two great trees, and, drinking in the pure, soft
A H O LIDAY i 99
air, I gathered much needed strength. There was a medicinal
spring near the house which did me much good. I became thank­
fully aware, as time went on, that God had sent me here not to
speak, but to rest, on these balmy heights.
My hosts showered on me the best the land afforded, and
appeared to be cordially delighted to have me.
It seems that a woman had lectured in this village before me,
under the auspices of my host, and had been much disliked,
so he was unable to make any arrangements, because the hostesses
having sufficiently large rooms in which to speak refused to
open their doors. Just before I left, however, a company drove
up to my host’s house, some miles out of the village, and taking
possession of the large veranda sent word to me, just as I was
going to bed, that they wished me to address them. I hesitated,
but as several urgent messages were sent up, I redressed and
gave them a talk in the moonlight. _ .
We had a long conversation on religion lasting until midnight,
and then there was a chorus of beseeching begging me to remain
and to speak to them in various houses in the village put at my
service; but I had made arrangements to leave the next morning,
as I had heard there was sickness at home and I was urgently
needed; so I was obliged to refuse these tardy invitations.
As I bade good-bye to my kind southern hosts, I was most
grateful to God, and to them, for this place of rest to which I
had been sent, as I think I should have quite broken down had I
not been detained here, almost against my will; for my host
ever urged me to remain longer, saying he hoped to arrange or
some meetings.
So God found a home of rest for me, and gave me new strength
for the wearing duties which fell to me when I returned to New
Harmony, several of the family being seriously ill.
I am thankful to say this meeting, under the southern moon,
was my last experience as a public speaker, and present y was
able to turn my attention to the work which is much more
congenial to me, the retired work of the writer.
TH E TWO PHILOSOPHIES
T h e n followed several years of strenuous work on my books,
The Mediators and Duality, the last winter and spring being spent
in the house where Laurence found me in the year 1888. During
the winter of 1887-8 I was led to pray, almost without ceas­
ing, for my stately mate shown me in the Vision. I led the
life of a recluse, scarcely going beyond our garden walls.
Sometimes I was waked at night with the words “ Pray for him,”
my whole soul being urged to give itself in strenuous beseeching
for an unknown man who seemed to be passing through some
important crisis. It was a difficult task, belonging to the realm of
mysteries, which my practical mind is inclined to dread. But I
felt I must persevere; and when, in the midst of this absorption,
Laurence appeared, it was exceedingly difficult for me to reconcile
the two duties. Difficult for me to wrench my mind from a mate
I did not know, and who might be not on earth but in heaven,
and to marry a man who was the mate of another woman, so I
believed.
But my guidance was plain, and how deeply thankful was I
that I had followed it, when Laurence fell ill and needed me
sorely; and when, in the attack which followed his death, I was
there to defend the man I reverenced and loved so deeply. I was
certain, because of the events which followed, that my leading
had been from God. He meant me to take Laurence’s name.
A M YSTERIOUS COMMAND
But now came a command which was even mote puzzling, so
puzzling that only a perfectly clear answer to the deepest prayer
I knew how to utter would have induced me to obey it.
The reader remembers when I resumed the story of my past
life, now brought to a close, that Grace and myself were at Haifa,
finishing business connected with Laurence’s estate, and Murray
was in Paris awaiting our arrival.
After much delay we were free to go to Europe. We had
decided to take a little flat in Paris, and I had sent Murray such
money as I could spare to furnish it very simply. I was taking
with me carpets, silver, and linen. .
We took steamer to Marseilles, and Murray met us at the I ans
station. How delighted we were to see again this dearest friend
of ours, the flush of joy on his face hiding from me for the
moment how thin and pale he looked. He had engaged a room
for Grace and myself in a quiet hotel, and when we three had
finished all we had to say to each other, we found it was after
one o’clock in the morning, and Murray had some difficulty
in finding his way out of the building, all the fights being
The next day he took us to see the flat, which would be ready
for occupation as soon as our Haifa belongings arrived from
Marseilles. u ,
He had done wonders with the small sum I had sent. He had
bought cheap plaster bas-reliefs and statues costing a few francs
each, and by manipulating them with wax, colouring matter,
etc., he had made them look like the most expensive antiques.
Out of common goods boxes he had made beautiful little shrines,
and he had searched the second-hand shops for effective furniture
costing very little; he had picked up good prints of fine pictures
which he had artistically framed through a device of his own, and
a few Venetian lamps and hangings from his Pans studio were
added. When we were settled we had a little reception of the
art students he had met while in Paris, and asked them to value
the art works in the flat, which we had been careful to place out
of their reach. They thought them worth several thousand
202 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
pounds; and were amazed to find they had not cost a hundred
francs.
It was a charming little home and Murray was delighted at our
appreciation, for it confirmed a theory of his that in the homes
of the future taste rather than money would confer distinction,
because beautiful things would become so cheap that the most
modest incomes would be able to afford them. Hence, the advan­
tage would lie not with the rich as against the poor, but with the
artistically refined as against the crudely coarse.
Grace and myself were soon settled in our little home. Murray
had found a very cheap room at the top of a very high house,
not far away, and had moved into it from the cabman’s hotel,
which, he said, had become unbearable, as he was surrounded
by evil women.
Here, in a bare room, he had worked on his Christ picture.
He now came to us for his meals and spent his evenings with us,
and in Paris, as at the foot of Mount Carmel, we three formed
a little paradise.
It was a pretty picture to see Grace and himself sitting on the
floor before the fire to finish some of the plaster bas-reliefs he had
bought, and which under his deft touch were being transformed
from common objects into refined works of art. They seemed so
happy, these two, as they worked together, they were so perfectly
at home with each other, that again my fears were aroused, and
I began to wonder whether I ought not to hasten Grace’s depar­
ture for America.
She suffered terribly from seasickness, the effect lasting for
weeks, so it had not seemed wise for her to make the journey
to America at this time of the year, midwinter. But it was better
to suffer physically, I thought, than to run the risk of awaking
a love which could only bring pain to both.
What, then, was my amazement when Murray, shortly after
our arrival, asked me to be his wife. He said to me:
“ Rosamond, a few days before you came, I was kept awake all
night through so pure a joy that it seemed to come straight from
heaven; my poor little room seemed to be illumined, my hard
bed to be made of roses, my curtainless window an angel’s
entrance. I praised Him, soul and body, with all my strength.
“ A Voice then said to me, ‘What woman has most helped you
to gain this nearness to God, and what woman, so far as you
know, can best bring you closer and closer to Him in the future?’
20}
A M YSTERIOUS COMMAND
“ ‘Rosamond,’ I answered, without a moment’s hesitation.
“ ‘Your chief desire,’ continued the Voice, ‘is to come close
to God, then is it not well to ask the woman to be your wife
who can best help you to reach Him?’ Rosamond, I am not
worthy of you, I know,” continued Murray, taking my hands
in his, “ and I cannot fill Laurence’s place, for he was a much
greater man than I am, but if a fife’s devotion will atone to you
a little for his loss, will you let me serve you always?”
I was dumb with astonishment.
“ I know,” said Murray wistfully, “ that I am asking too much,
and I do not wonder at your silence.”
“ It is not that I doubt your worthiness,” I said. “ You have
grown by leaps and bounds in these last months, you have come
to be a man the best woman living might be proud of, I do not
know another man like you anywhere. In the beginning of our
acquaintance, yes, there were some lacks in you, some weaknesses,
so it seemed to me; but in the last year you have developed as
few men grow in a lifetime. You have sacrificed all to be faithful
to your duty, and God has clothed you with a new dignity, my
beloved friend.
“ The trouble is that you are too good for me. You are young,
you are handsome, you are gifted, your life lies before you as a
fair page; and to the utmost of my ability I will help you to five
it as your friend, but I have no right, it seems to me, to burden
you by becoming your wife. I am thirteen years older than you
are, eminent physicians say that I may be paralysed for fife at
any time, and certainly there is often an ominous coldness throug -
out my right side; and whether I am paralysed or not, my weak
body will always be more or less of a load. I am in my forty- t
year, and so my youth is behind me. Don’t ask me, dearest frien ,
to take your name, and so prevent you from marrying your true
mate, should you find her. I cannot let you assume such a bur en.
With Laurence it was different; I knew that we were not eternally
destined for one another, as I know that you and I are not eter­
nally destined for one another; but he needed my services in s
last long illness, and so God led me to take his name, in or er
that I could be near him day and night, and, with Alice s he p,
comfort him to the last. But you are a splendid young man, with,
I believe, a splendid future.”
Murray knelt by me and said, “ Rosamond, listen. Were
sure that you would be paralysed all your fife, and did I know t at
204 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
I would have to carry you about, a helpless physical burden, until
your death, still I wish to marry you, for it is not your body which
I love but your soul, the noblest that ever I knew. New energies
wake in me, new inspirations come to me, when you are near me.
My God is a living Presence when you are there to help me find
Him. Oh, I wish to serve Him with all my strength, and no
woman in all the world can help me as you can. I do not claim
you as my mate, I only ask for your constant companionship.
I can well believe that a far greater than I is destined for you, in the
end, for I am not your equal, I know it; but for His work’s sake,
put your hand in mine, and let us walk together, because together
we can best serve Him. This is the only plea I am justified in
offering, I am led to entreat you to be my fellow-worker for
Christ’s sake.”
I could not suppress my sobs, for Murray had almost the look
of an angel as he knelt beside me, clasped his hands over my knees,
and raised his beautiful eyes to mine. Somewhere, deep down in
my soul, a premonition seemed to be given me that he belonged
to those who die young, because they belong to Heaven rather
than to our poor earth.
“ Will you give me time to pray that I may know His Will?”
I said at last.
He raised me and, folding me in his arms, kissed my forehead.
“ Yes,” he said, “ ask God for guidance, but for myself I am sure
He has told me that I may love and serve you.”
I spent two nights in prayer before a clear guidance was
vouchsafed to me. I could not divest myself of the thought that
it was wholly unfair to bind Murray’s fate to mine. Had Grace,
beautiful, young, charming, gifted, been free, then without a
moment’s hesitation I should have been glad to join their hands.
She, it seemed to me, suited him perfectly; but I, old, broken,
almost ugly, what right had I to burden him?
Grace watched me with anxious tenderness during these two
days, for she guessed some struggle was going on within me.
It seemed, at last, kinder to tell her.
“ Oh, Aunt Rosamond,” she cried, “ the best man on earth has
asked you to marry him; take him, honey; don’t refuse him.” And
then, quickly changing, as she was apt to do when there was too
great a seriousness, she added, “ You dear, delightful little aunt of
mine, no doubt you are a very clever woman, but sometimes, you
know, you are as blind as a bat. We all saw, on the way to Haifa,
2 0 J
A M YSTERIO US COMMAND
that Murray had eyes for no one but you. He nearly broke his
neck falling over everything on the deck, he was so constantly
looking at you. You and he may think that his love for you is
new born, but I know better.”
“ He is not meant for me. I am sure he is not the mate God made
for me from the beginning,” I cried.
A spasm passed across Grace’s face, and for a moment she
opened wide her beautiful eyes and let me gaze straight through
them to her soul. Even as I had looked into them when she was
three hours old, and had seen there a depth I could not fathom,
so now, after many years, I again stood humbled and abashed,
for I perceived in her a strength I cannot describe. It was as though
the memory of many martyrdoms, with flames turned to sparkling
glories, had wrought in her an indomitable strength. I can
wait until God is ready,” her soul seemed to say to mine.
The next moment I wondered whether I had been quite mis­
taken, my imagination having run wild, for she was dancing
around me like a mischievous sprite.
“ My part is to see to it that Murray has his boots blacked
on his wedding-day. If I don’t look after him, he will appear with
the face of an angel and boots which would disgrace a beggar.
You know he will, auntie. So now and here, I appoint myself
Master of Ceremonies, for you will both forget, if I don’t look
after you, that people must look their very best when they are
getting married.”
At last I felt that my indecision was putting too great a strain
on Murray, and I cried to the Lord with all my strength to let
me see clearly.
The answer seemed to me to be plain. “ You must yield to
Murray’s wish, for he, when he was very near to his God, has
clearly heard God’s Voice.” ,
So I consented to our marriage, but it was an act of blind
obedience, for it did not seem to me a fitting thing to burden so
promising a life with my disabilities. .
We were married in the Chapel of the Embassy. Daisy arrived
a few days before the wedding, so I had my two dear children
with me, and an intimate friend of Murray’s joined the tt e
wedding-party.
Murray gave me no time to prepare a wedding-dress, so 1wore
a brocaded blue silk he admired, which a cousin had given to a
sister, and the sister to me, therefore it was third hand, ut
2o6 M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
Murray thought it suited me well, so it did not matter that it was
not new; indeed, I much dislike new clothes, for they seem to
have no magnetism in them.
My heart was still somewhat anxiously troubled in spite of the
clear answer I had received, for every glass in the waiting-room
at the Embassy which reflected our images seemed to be saying,
“ You are unequally yoked,” as he looked so young and so hand­
some, and I so old and plain.
But my fears melted away in the weeks which followed, for
Murray seemed so very happy. He still kept his studio, and he
often took me on his back, as though I had been a child, and
carried me up the many flights of stairs until we reached his
attic. There he established me, and resumed painting on his
picture of Christ, turning to me for help, while I worked on my
book, The Mediators.
He bought a wheeled-chair, and we spent long afternoons
roving about, as I was less and less able to walk long distances.
When we found some sheltered nook, he would perch himself
on the foot of the chair, and we talked together, endlessly, as we
had inexhaustible subjects of common interest. So my heart was
comforted, and I prayed ever more fervently that God would
teach me how to add more and more to his deep contentment.
I did not know why I had been told to marry him, but my duty
was now plain, I must fill his life with joy, in so far as it lay in
my power to do so.
The week after our marriage a book was sent to us, written
by a Paris friend of Jennie’s, in which we were accused of every
sort of sin, and several letters reached us from Murray’s friends,
filled with bitter reproaches.
I could understand the disappointment of Murray’s father,
seeing that his only son, on whom any parent could build high
hopes, had married a middle-aged invalid. It was hard for him,
I knew.
Yet how could I grieve, when we four, in our little flat, were
so gaily happy, that the outside world could no longer distress
us. We did not mind, any more, what was said of us, no matter
how harsh it might be, for we knew that His Spirit filled our
sweet home.
A lady occupying a prominent position in Paris had sent us the
book, and asked presently to come and see us. She was a strik­
ingly intellectual woman of an imposing appearance, and she
207
A M YSTERIOUS COMMAND
seemed determined to probe us to the bottom. We both felt
quietly unconcerned, for we were trying to do, to the best of our
ability, in each moment of each day, what Jesus Christ desired
us to do. We had placed the past and the future in His hands
and only asked to be guided in the passing moment. At the end
of a searching examination, lasting over an hour, she suddenly
turned to me and said :
“ Were I in deep trouble, were my husband to die, or any other
great loss to befall me, you are the woman to whom I should
turn for consolation.” She joined Murray’s hand and mine in
hers and said earnestly, “ May God bless you both.”
I kissed her gratefully, and whenever her busy life permitted
it we had most enjoyable talks with this remarkable woman.
An old acquaintance of Laurence’s also found her way to our
flat, her carriage with its liveried servants making a great stir in
our little impasse. She was very rich, had a high-sounding title,
and lived in a grand mansion, where she invited us to visit her.
Her unmarried son took me in to dinner, and although he lived
in a palace fit for a king he seemed to be very much bored.
During our talk he said to me, “ I can imagine love without
marriage, or marriage without love, but I cannot imagine a
love which would endure after marriage.
I looked around the splendid dining-room, with a balcony
for an orchestra, at the glittering table, the sumptuous toilets,
and then back to the blasé, rather sensual face of my host, in which
there was not a ray of the joy which made our own little home so
delightful a spot.
“ I am sorry for you, deeply sorry,” I could not help saying,
for he had grasped at so much, and he had so little.
His eyes opened in startled surprise, for I suppose the Due de S.,
so rich that he did not know what to do with his money, was not
used to being pitied. Then I looked across at Murray, who seemed
a king among these men. His bright glance met mine, and when
my neighbour caught it, a sigh, which was almost a sob, suddenly
burst from his lips.
“ You are happy, yes,” he murmured. He said little during the
rest of the meal, only speaking when his good breeding prompted
it, but I felt that he was pondering many things.
As soon as we could be excused we ran back to our flat like two
happy children, and found the girls still up waiting to hear all
about the party. How sweet it seemed to get back to our little nest.
208 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
A few weeks after we were married Grace said to m e:
“ Aunt Rosamond, I think I ought to go back to Charlie, and
I have decided that I ought no longer to live a brother and sister
life, but to yield to his wish and to have a child, which he earnestly
desires.”
“ This subject is sacred between yourselves,” I said, “ and no
one else can decide for you; so, my dearest child, I can only
pray that God may guide you aright.”
A pathetic look stole into her eyes uplifted to mine, the look
of the martyr I had seen there in that brief glimpse, when I had
spoken about our marriage, and a pang seized me, for I seemed
to sense a coming doom.
Daisy and I bade her God-speed in the flat, and Murray
accompanied her to the coast to see her well on her way.
They, Murray and Grace, stood together on the landing of the
stairs, looking up at us, to say her last good-bye. The memory of
her sweet face, which I was never to see again, remains with me
to this day. The merry light, which was rarely absent, was gone;
her mournful eyes, large with a strange apprehension, were turned
to me, grown pathetically dark and sombre; but as she saw my
anxious gaze, she tried to smile j it was a pitiful failure, for her
whole face was drawn with pain.
Still she sought to rally her old spirit. She wore a very becoming
and handsome dark red toque and cloak, a part of her trousseau,
and she swept us a little curtsy, saying, “ Do you notice how grand
I look, I’ve worn it on purpose, so that the memory of my splen­
dour will keep me from feeling too abjectly demoralized when
I am seasick. It will restore the balance, as it were.”
And so she went out of our lives, our beautiful Grace, the most
charming personality I have ever known, and yet with a spirit
possessing an unbreakable strength such as belongs to few of
the solidly solemn characters I have met.
When I returned to the flat, with an aching heart, I found Daisy
in her room; she had thrown herself on her bed in a passion of
grief, and seemed to be sobbing her heart out. This was so unlike
our placid girlie that I was astonished. She seemed unable to
regain her balance for several days, and she told me afterwards
that she felt she would never see her deeply-loved sister again.
“ Oh, auntie, auntie,” she sobbed, “ when her beautiful eyes
were turned to us, as she stood on the stairs, I felt it was her last
look in this world, and it seemed more than I could bear.”
A M YSTERIOUS COMMAND 209
When Murray returned after seeing her safely on the boat,
his cheerful account of their journey and Grace’s many bright
messages seemed to reassure us. Surely our fears were without
foundation, we had only been imagining that some evil would
befall her. When we received a letter from her from New York,
giving us a most amusing account of her voyage, and she described
her home-coming in a hopeful spirit, telling us of Charlie s
intense pleasure at seeing her again and how good he was to
her, we decided that we had been morbidly apprehensive, and
that our precious Grace was quite safe and happy with her devoted
husband.
O
AM ERICAN W AYS
W e left Paris, storing our things, to be sent eventually to Eng­
land, and spent the summer in Switzerland. Margaret grew in
beauty and grace, and was much admired at the hotel where
we took our meals, our rooms being in an overflow cottage
near-by.
One day an Austrian aristocrat begged for an interview.
“ Madame,” he said, “ I am afraid you will think me rude, but
it seems necessary to speak to you. Almost every evening after
dinner you leave your pretty niece in the salon of the hotel without
a chaperon, to join in the dances and games, while you and your
husband retire to your cottage. This seems to me an extraordinary
thing to do.”
“ Baron F.,” I said, “ when your son goes to a dinner-party do
you follow him to see that he does not steal the silver from the
table?”
“ Certainly not,” said the Baron, with some indignation.
“ Well,” I said, “ I should no more think of watching my niece
to ensure that she will behave properly, than you would think
of watching your son to see that he does not steal the silver.
I have told my niece to be in her room at the cottage at ten o’clock,
and she never disregards my wish. She is always punctual. I
desire that she shall retire early for her health’s sake, but otherwise
I lay no restrictions on her, for I fully trust the girl I have brought
up from babyhood.”
A few weeks afterwards the Baron joined me in the garden
and said:
“ Madame I have a confession to make. I have taken it upon
myself to watch your niece whenever she was out of the cottage.
In the salon, in the summer-houses, everywhere I have followed
her, to see whether, in truth, you were right, and she could be
, trusted.”
“ Well, Baron F.,” I said smiling, “ what did you dis­
cover?”
“ I discovered that the girls who are constantly watched were
rather unmaidenly in their conduct if they were left unwatched,
even for a few moments; whereas Mademoiselle Marguerite
AM ERICAN W AYS 2 11
has done nothing which the angels themselves could not have
looked upon. Her conduct has been blameless.”
“ Precisely, Monsieur,” I said. “ We Americans trust to the
honour of our girls rather than to espionage; and, in the great
majority of cases, they prove themselves to be worthy of that
trust. In America, as elsewhere, there are some girls who are
not refined, and would remain coarse under any circumstances,
but the system tends to induce a higher, rather than a lower,
morality; for we are taught that it is our duty to be even more
dignified in our reserve, when we are alone with young men, than
when we have the support of our elders. It works well, believe
me, Baron, and I only wish other nations would follow our
custom. My fear is that, instead, we may be tempted to imitate
your ways.
“ The constant, unwatched, and yet innocent companionship
between men and maids in America, especially in the Western
villages of America, where we were born and bred, is, I am sure,
conducive to good in every way; for the natural desire for the
society of the opposite sex is satisfied, and hence an unnatural
outbreak, following an artificially restrained intercourse, is not
so apt to occur.
“ We have such a very jolly time in our Western villages, I
continued, “ without any harm following, and it seems a great
pity that the young people of other countries should be robbed,
uselessly, of so much innocent pleasure, does it not?
“ I have lived a number of years in a very religious Colony
where the young people were never allowed to be together. In
the earlier days of the little village the young men walked about
alone, and the young girls did the same. In the congregations all
the women sat on one side of the church and the men on the other,
and when they were dismissed the women went out and were
well on their way before the men were permitted to follow. What
was the consequence? There was more sin in that Colony, and
sin of a strange nature, than in our happy little village, although
the Colonists were, perhaps, better men and women by nature
than the New Harmonites. It was the system which was at fault,
and not the remarkably good, even heroically brave, people of
the Colony. You cannot watch any human being without inter­
mission day and night, hence there are always opportunities for
sin. The only unfailing safeguard, then, is a God-given purity.
Is it not true, therefore, that this is the protection we should seek
212 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
to find, seeing that it is the only sure, the only ever-present,
protection?”
“ It is a new idea,” said the Baron, “ which I must consider.
But in any event Mademoiselle Marguerite is a good and charming
girl, and may I offer you my felicitations because you possess so
well trained a niece.”

A STAM PEDE
We went from Switzerland to London, where we intended to
establish ourselves for some time, in order to do what lay in our
power to minimize the harm which had been done by Jennie’s
onslaught, as we feared it might interfere with any future work
we might be called on to do, through my books or in any other
way. Murray and Margaret went house-hunting, and came back
one afternoon in high glee, saying they had found exactly the
right house. I went to see it the next day, and found that it was
rather an imposing four-story building, with a fine studio for
Murray on the upper floor. We could take it on a sub-lease for
nine months, and the terms were very reasonable.
“ But how are we to furnish it?” I said. “ The few things we had
in our flat will be lost in this house.”
“ I have a feeling that we shall manage it, somehow; at any rate
we can furnish it in part. We are allowed a good sum for repairs,
and I shall see to it that the wall-papers, etc., are artistic, so there
will be a good background.”
Murray seemed so anxious to take the house that I yielded.
He wrote to the overseer of his father’s business to send him a
few things which he had stored in the factory, sent for our
Paris furniture, and roved about picking up cheap and pretty
hangings. Presently a large furniture van arrived at our front
door, and to our astonishment it contained enough household
belongings to make us decently comfortable for the moment.
It seems Murray’s father grew tired of his furnishings every few
years, and storing them in the factory, where they lay forgotten,
he bought new things.
Some of this discarded furniture, which looked almost new,
had been shipped by the overseer. S o w e w e r e fairly well provided
for temporarily, and Murray, spending only a few pounds, made
the house look charming, so everyone said who visited us.
“ You see, Rosamond, that my inspiration about the house
was right. The Lord has provided the furnishings. We shall have
room to receive visitors and a fitting place in which to influence
them for good, and to bring about, in so far as we can, peace
and unity.”
214 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
Murray suggested that we should go to Scotland for a short
visit, while the house was being papered and repaired. He wished
to take me to a resort where he used to go, and where some of
his friends generally went in September, for he hoped, if only
we could meet, the feud would vanish. I was not so hopeful as
he, still, it was my duty to do all that lay in my power to overcome
their enmity,
The Sunday after our arrival we went to the place of worship
frequented by his friends, and Murray whispered to me that
several of his intimates were in the church and that evidently
they had seen us. But none of them waited to speak to us at the
end of the service, instead they hurried out of the church as fast
as they could go.
We went rather wearily homeward, for I seemed to be growing
ever more delicate, and the exertion of dressing, going to the
church, and supporting the hard stares of Murray’s acquaint­
ances, had tired me out. On reaching home I threw myself on
the bed, and Murray sat beside me soothing me with his gentle
touch.
Suddenly a furious anger seemed to possess me. I sat up, with
flashing eyes, and a torrent of words seemed to force themselves
from my lips.
“ What right have these people to condemn me for sins I have
never dreamt of committing; what is their church-going worth,
when it does not teach them the truth; of what use is it to repeat
long prayers, year after year, if at the end they wickedly judge a
person who is seeking to serve Christ with every breath she
draws? I have now borne this injustice patiently for years, and
yet they are no nearer to the truth than they were in the beginning.
How can these people dare to call themselves the followers of
Christ, one of whose chief commands is not to judge.”
Murray’s look of deep concern arrested me.
“ Why, Rosamond,” he said, gently taking my hands in his
and kissing them, “ I have never seen you look or speak like
this in all our long acquaintance.”
I dropped back on my pillow in tears. “ Murray,” I said,
“ forgive me, I am the culprit, for am I not breaking Christ’s
command in judging these people? How can I tell what Satan
whispers in their ears; how he tempts them? Certainly, it is not
for me to judge them, when the evil one has just turned me, for
the moment, into a Fury. Dearest, forgive me.”

A STAM PEDE
Murray lifted me in his arms tenderly, and carried me to the
window from whence one could see a beautiful and extended view.
“ Yes ” I said, “ God’s world is large and beautiful, and I have
been small and mean.” Then, as I caught sight of the church in
the distance where we had met Murray’s friends, I remembered
how these worthy people had raced down the lane leading from
the church in hot haste, as though they were fleeing from a pest,
with coat-tails, veils, and ribbons flying behind, one member
nearly losing his tall hat in his efforts to get away; and a fit of
laughter seized me, which swept away the last remnant of my
^M urray smoothed my hair, put on my hat and cloak, and took
me downstairs to the pretty grounds surrounding the Water Cure,
where we were staying. This tender care, exquisite in its gentle
sympathy, comforted me greatly, and as I sat on a bench, my
aching back supported by his strong arm, his love poured through
me, soul and body, as a healing balm. _
I turned to him, and lifting my face to kiss him, 1 said:
“ Ah, Murray, so long as your loving-kindness shelters me,
what does it matter whether others are civil to me or not. It
they were to give me all their devotion, would it equal your
devotion? God has given me much more than most women
possess, then it is wicked for me to complain. If you will forgive
me this once, I promise never, never, to get into such a bad
temper again. What do you think possessed me?
“ The devil,” said Murray sententiously.
“ You are right,” I exclaimed.
We returned to London without being recognized by any of
Murray’s people, but during our nine months’ stay several of
his near friends and cousins visited us, and returned to Scotland
to give an enthusiastic account of our home.
Some of his relatives, however, steadily refused to see me,
saying that I was a witch, for all who visited us were drawn to
me, and they did not intend to run the risk of being e oo e .
Again I had a short struggle with Satan, for I am a practical
person, and where religion—for all these people were regu ar
church-goers— seems to have not one particle of rea in uence,
a Christian behaving as though he were a h e a t h e n , my common
sense is in revolt. I am ever tempted to ask myself, at is
all worth?”
216 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
But it was growing ever clearer to me that I had a right to
condemn the sin but not the sinner, for it was utterly impossible
for me to fathom the smallest human soul, and to know how it
had been born and through what environments it had been
shaped. Hence, I had no means of judging how far these seemingly
hard and cruel people, who, after all, had heard only evil of me,
were responsible for their apparent hardness and cruelty. A human
soul is so profound a mystery that only God, who made it, and
has followed it through all its progressions, can tell to what
extent it is responsible for its misdeeds.
And there was much excuse for them: From the world’s
standpoint Murray’s marriage was a mistake. I was not young
nor strong in health, nor pretty, nor rich, and they had been told
that I was not even a good woman. Yet had they been willing to
look into my husband’s beautiful eyes for a moment, they would
have seen that none of these things mattered to him, for a
spirit-pure love illumined his tender gaze. His soul sought my
soul and he was satisfied.
GRACE
We had been chatting one day, in our home m London, before
we separated to begin our daily tasks. We were laughing hearti y
at a sally of a cousin of ours, a witty, entertaining girl, who was
visiting us, when a cablegram was handed to me; it read:

I looked at the others, unable to speak, and Margare“ ° ° k

telegram out of my hands. With a singular calm she read it aloud
to them, and then left the room. Murray, gathering me in his
arms carried me upstairs to the studio, where he placed me on
a couch opposite his picture of Christ, which Grace had watched
with such eager interest while it was being pamted.
The room swam around me, as an almost intolerablesene of
loss took possession of me. Grace dead, it was not possib e

intense gratitude to our Lord who, being omnipotent, has the
power to bridge the chasm of death.
No spoken words were ever more clearly heard, for Grace
was very near to me. I repeated what she had said to Murray,
and with the thankful tears streaming over our faces we knelt
together to thank Him for permitting Grace to come to us, for
her loss seemed to us almost more than we could bear. She had
twined herself into our very fibre; her potent charm was not
ephemeral, but so lasting that it seemed impossible for us to
be robbed of it. And we were not despoiled, for again and again
she came, brighter, sweeter, more gay of wit even than in life,
so that often I laughed aloud at some characteristic sally of hers,
and the family would ask, “ Is it Grace?”
There are many who fear the evil effects of Spiritualism, and
their fear is warranted if by Spiritualism we mean a morbid
curiosity which seeks, at séances, to probe into the hidden secrets
of the Inner World. Murray and I never permitted such meetings
to be held in our home ; for we perceived, so far as our experience
went, that their tendency was to unbalance the sitters taking part
in the séance. But if by Spiritualism one means the Christ-given
vision, the normal vision of the spiritual body, which perceives
the beloved ones who have been taken, so that instead of an awful
wrench there is a tender renewal of familiar intercourse— this
spirit communion is most sanely sweet, and is His consoling gift
to men. He knows how dreadful is our heartache, and as He is
infinitely pitiful, He permits that, joined by Himself, our dearest
ones may clasp our hands across the chasm.
I am not much given to expressing my love, and for that reason,
perhaps, it is all the deeper, so that I am almost intolerably hurt
when my dear ones are wrested from me. My mother, Laurence,
Grace—these losses seemed almost to kill me, and God, knowing
my nature, has not permitted more to be inflicted upon me than
I could bear. He has led my beloved ones back to me, and has
permitted them to speak to me, as He will bless all who live
close to Him. He does not desire that we shall be cruelly hurt,
but deeply blessed.
How great a boon was Murray’s companionship during these
first trying hours, how it helped me to know that our souls were
knit together in our love for Grace. But suddenly it struck us
that we had been nearly half an hour in the studio, and that we
had seen nothing of Margaret. A pang of remorse went through

hurried to her room, and there I saw a sight which touched me

have toudicd me as did this homely attempt to please her dead

I knew what her love for her sister had been She had said
to me “ I cannot imagine that anyone would trouble even to look

girl. “ But Grace,” she would say— “ oh, Grace is every ng

her to her own room, I found her stretched on her bedsobb g

She said God had been good in giving her so strong a premo

“ I knew it was coming,” she said. etcrino-

COLOGNE CATH EDRAL AND “ PARSIFAL”
W h e n our London lease had expired Margaret returned to
America, emptied of the presence which most had drawn her
home, and we went back to Haifa, bereft of the hope that Grace
would not be separated from us for long; for we had intended,
after a time, to establish our permanent home in America among
my people.
It was now early spring, so we decided to make our way
leisurely across Europe, living in quiet, cheap little places
until the autumn, when the heat would be over in the Orient.
Murray and I had had one, and only one, bone of contention.
He thought Wagner the greatest musician in the world, whereas
I clung to my love for Beethoven.
“ Let us go to Cologne and see the Cathedral,” he suggested,
“ and let us go to Bayreuth and hear ‘Parsifal,’ then our eyes
and ears will be satisfied, when we return to the intellectual
dearth of the Orient.”
We made our visit to the Cathedral in the late afternoon.
A draped coffin with tall candles on either side stood in the
aisle, and somewhere in the distance a choir was chanting.
We sat side by side with clasped hands, and then a strange
thing befell m e:
An exquisite influx flowed from Murray’s being into mine,
as he gazed up at the pure aspirational lines of the Cathedral,
which gave him such intense delight. I seemed to be wrapt in
his love; impersonal, for he was filled with a sense of the Cathe­
dral’s chaste beauty, rather than with a sense of my presence,
and yet intimately personal, for it swept through me, body and
soul.
In that moment a new fife was born in me; I conceived what
beauty meant; I knew, as I had never known before, how infinite
were the mysteries of Him who created every lovely curve and
tint throughout the Universe. My husband’s beauty-seeing
artist soul impregnated my soul with a wholly new conception.
I had been arid, austere, dressing in grey or black, as a rule,
and inclined to fear all richness; now I knew that I had been a
blind woman, from whom endless delights had been quite hidden.
COLOGNE CATH ED RAL AND “ PARSIFAL’ 221
I looked up at my husband, and his eyes gazed down into mine,
shining like stars. . , . „
God did not mean to give us a child, so we believed, but He
had now given us an intimate one-ness of vision, which had
created in me a new life. From that moment Murray and I were
linked as we had never been before.
“ I have always known it,” said Murray, “ always known that
sex has endlessly varied, loftily noble uses, and is not confined
to one privilege.”
We sat on, oblivious of time, wrapped in a pure delight, which,
radiating from us, seemed to be reflected again from every perfect
line of this wonderful creation of man, this prayer in stone.
The new life conceived in me during that blessed hour in
Cologne Cathedral has endured until now, through many lonely
years, so that every flower on Mount Carmel fills all my senses
with a thrilling pleasure I never used to know, a delight dimly
akin to the joy of the Creator when He made every beautiful
thing.
All the pleasure grasped by sensualism cannot equal this
exquisite influx from God, which might fill all lovers, soul and
sense, if only they were pure enough to see His face, for Christ
has promised that such searchers shall be blessed.
God gave my soul, through Murray, this divine art-sense,
and He has never taken it away, although I am now an elderly
woman. I know that I perceive only the faintest glimpse of the
Glory He means to give us, but even that dim ray illumines the
long and solitary way.
Then we went to Bayreuth and heard “ Parsifal. Here again
our souls were knit, and in some strange, unfathomable way they
were knit through Grace, who so loved music. She was between
us, we felt, as we sat in the darkened auditorium, and she taught
each of us the better to know the other.
“ Well?” asked Murray, turning to me at the end, as we sat
wrapped in harmony, loth to leave the building, although silence
now claimed it.
“ Yes, yes, yes,” I whispered; “ youare right, and I am wrong.
I yield completely. ‘Parsifal’ is an inspiration from Heaven.
Don’t let us go back into the world, but stay here always.
But we were obliged to go back into the world and to drain
■one of its bitterest cups.
HAIFA, PA LESTIN E
We took ship at Venice and journeyed to the Orient, only we
two left out of all the company, and yet we two were more
than a host, for we were united, harmonious, desiring to move as
God wished us to move; and so we did not feel lonely, for, so
the Voice says, a human being has two societies. The point //\^
represents the person, the two lines his earthly sphere of useful­
ness, and in exact proportion to this earthly area is the heavenly
area, thus:
HEAVEN
EARTH
namely, the heavenly Helpers of a human being are in precise
proportion to his earthly ministrations; he who labours and
prays for a hundred men having a hundred unseen friends to aid
him. For this reason a true humanitarian never feels solitary,
while selfish ones, though they grasp all things, end by being
bored, for the air about them is empty of living souls, pulseless,
spiritually stagnant. No wonderful depths of delight are revealed
to them.
Murray and I gratefully realized this truth as we settled into
our daily routine. There was no music, no art, no intellectual
stir of any kind around us. Our kind and good neighbours
paid us occasional visits, but their lives and ours were differently
attuned. They did not care for the mental food which was our
daily bread. So he worked at his painting and I at my book in
a long succession of happy days, which made no history, for each
was like the other, calmly, richly happy. He was good to me, ah,
how good, letting no slightest burden fall on me if he could
help it. If he saw my slender wrists could not turn a lock easily,
it was oiled the next time I tried it. If I shivered in a draught,
I found a curtained wire built around my easy chair. If I expressed
a liVing for some edible, he scoured the town to find it. He
worked daily at his music to give me pleasure each evening.
So I walked in a sphere of love, protected, comforted always.
HAIFA, PALESTINE 223
The days slipped by like beads on a rosary, each holding its
blessing, until our lives seemed to be one great prayer, for all
men.
One morning I was awakened by the sound of the organ. A
fine march, spirited and sonorous, rolled its rich harmonies
upward to my room. I slipped on my wrapper, and opened the
door of my bedroom to hear it better. Presently the music ceased,
and Murray came bounding up the stairs.
“ Do you remember, Rosamond, that this is the second anni­
versary of our wedding-day?”
He picked me up and waltzed around the room with me. As
he set me down again, I looked up at him, and saw, to my joy,
that his eyes were shining, his step buoyant, and that his laugh
rang through the room as though he were a care-free boy.
This handsome, young husband of mine was happy, in spite of
the fact that he was saddled with an old wife, who was ever
growing more of a burden to him.
“ I am afraid I had forgotten it, Murray, I am sorry; but you
know how stupid I am about dates and places, I never can
remember anniversaries.”
“ Never mind. I have remembered it. Do you like the Wedding
March I have composed for you, in secret, while you were in
the garden?”
“ I do, very much indeed. I must hear it many times before I
shall truly appreciate it, for you know I am slow in my compre­
hension of music. But it seemed to me to have a splendid swing.
I immediately felt I must march on somewhere, to do something
worth while, and I suppose that is the mission of a march, and
proves it to be a fine one. Will you play it for me again after
breakfast?”
“ Yes,” said Murray, “ we are not going to work to-day, we are
going to have a holiday. Dress yourself in your prettiest clothes
and come downstairs as soon as you can.”
He looked back at me from the open door, and I knew he was
planning some surprise as I heard him run downstairs and call
Lisa and Herbert, a young married couple we had brought with
us, as servants, from England. I had dismissed the nine servants
I had found when I came to Haifa, and kept only two, Dali the
cook and Saleh, her husband, the coachman; to these had been
added Lisa as housemaid and general overseer, and Herbert
m
224 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PALESTIN E
as gardener and man-of-all-work. The two sets of servants did
not work well together, however, so finally, to avoid discord,
I kept only the two English servants, offering the others a place
at Dalieh, and my house and garden were better kept than when
I had nine.
I heard a great bustle going on downstairs, and when I
descended I walked into a bower of flowers. The breakfast-
table was also decorated with bouquets, and a number of little
presents for myself and the servants were piled on it. I thought,
with a pang, that I had bought nothing for Murray.
But he did not seem to notice the neglect, he was so pleased
with my appreciation of his efforts.
“ You are happy, Rosamond,” he said, a little wistfully, “ these
two years would have seemed a little emptier had I not been with
you?”
“ Oh, Murray, you have been like an angel, and I could not do
without you. My only fear is that I am too much petted and
spoiled.”

TH E O RIEN TAL POINT OF VIEW
As we finished breakfast, Yusuf, a servant from our mountain
home, Dalieh, asked to see us. He was waiting in the garden.
When we joined him, we found he was watching several
chickens bound by the legs, and he held them out to me with a
broad grin. “ Here they are,” he said, “ thinner than before.
He spoke a little English, which Alice had taught him.
I did not quite understand, then I remembered a little inciden
which had happened before I had sent Saleh and Dab to Dalieh:
I was leaning out of the window, my attention having been
drawn by some high-pitched, voluble talking. Dali the cook,
and Hajali, a Druse girl from Dalieh, were bargaining over some
chickens for the servants’ table, which lay on the horse-block
with legs bound. The two women were gesticulating and talking
with great animation. Finally a bargain seemed to be struc
the girl went towards the gate of the stable-yard, while Dali
disappeared in the direction of the servants’ quarters. The next
instant Hajali darted back, seized the chickens, and ran through
the gate like a deer. Presently Dali reappeared and went to the
horse-block for the chickens. She peered in every direction.
“ Are you looking for the chickens, Dali?” I said.
“ Yes, Madam.”
“ Hajali has taken them away. Had you bought them.
“ Yes, the miserable thief; they were thin as chicken could be,
I paid her too much, and now she has stolen them,” said Dali
wrathfully. v e
At that moment Saleh appeared from the stable, and Yusut
from Dalieh, and there was great excitement in the stable-yard,
Saleh threatening to go to Dalieh at once, and to accuse Hajali
before the Sheikhs.
Yusuf begged for a few days of grace, and promised to arrange
the matter. So I told Saleh to leave it to Yusuf. _ _
“ I went to Hajali,” explained Yusuf when we joined him,
“ and I said, ‘Hajali, the Sitt (Madam) is a very great lady, and a
great lady must not eat thin chickens, it is a shame ; you knew
this Hajali, and so you brought them back to Dalieh to make
them fatter, so they would be good enough for Madam to eat.
p
226 M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PALESTIN E
Now they are very fat, so I will take them back to her.’ There
they are,” concluded Yusuf, presenting his chickens to me with
a chuckle, “ the thinnest birds I ever saw.”
“ But, Yusuf,” I said, “ this was a he. Hajali stole the chickens,
and did not take them back to fatten them.”
“ Lie, yes, but that is nothing, a lie is very good, better than
truth. For had I spoke true, Hajali would have been whipped
very bad by the Sheikhs. Now Hajali is not whipped, she is not
angry with me, and you, Sitt, have your chickens. All this good,
not bad; so lie is very good. I like lies very much.”
In vain I tried to explain to Yusuf the value of truthfulness.
He only grinned and repeated, “ Lie is very good, I like to tell
lies better; here are the chickens,” and he held them out as proof
positive that lies were much to be preferred.
The only thing I could do was not to give him the backsheesh
he expected, a reproof he understood well; and to send him on
an honest errand, afterwards, for which I paid him.
We were so amused by his Oriental point of view that we had
some ado to control our countenances, and to administer the
rebuke seriously enough.
In the afternoon Murray went to the Turkish Post Office to
look for some missing magazines; here he had another glimpse
of the Oriental way of looking at things.
We had subscribed for several of the best English and American
magazines, in order that we might keep in touch with the world’s
doings. These had not reached us for several months, and Murray
had been to inquire about them on more than one occasion.
He knew it would be a pleasure for me to have some fresh
literature to enliven our holiday, so he went to town to make a
last attempt. Looking about, he spied a pile of our magazines in
an old box behind the grille.
“ Why, here they are,” he said to the postmaster, who spoke
a little French.
“ Yes, there they are,” he said, with an imperturbable mien.
“ I have not given them to you, because it is obscene literature.”
“ Obscene literature!” exclaimed Murray, “ why, these are the
best English and American magazines. I should like their
editors to hear you accuse them of publishing unreadable
vulgarity 1”
“ All the same, it is obscene literature,” repeated the Turk
stolidly.
TH E O RIEN TAL POINT OF VIEW 227
Murray reasoned with him for some time, but in vam, the
Turk persisted in saying he could not deliver the magazines.
“ Show me what you consider objectionable, suggested
Murray at last. . . ,
The Turk opened one of the magazines and pointed out a
picture by Michael Angelo, in which were two boy angels, almost
naked. “ Here,” he said, “ look at these children without any
Cl°“ But your children run about the streets no better clad!”
Murray exclaimed. . , ,
“ Ah, yes, but they are children, not pictures; we do not take
their pictures when they are naked. That is a shame.
Murray could not restrain his amusement, and laughed
heartily; but the Turk only stared in solemn surprise.
“ Come, now,” said Murray, “ you would not have kept all my
magazines because of this picture. Is there not something
else?” . . ,
The Turk slowly hunted through the Review of Reviews and
found an illustrated article in which some pictures of Turks
aP“ Very good,” said Murray. “ I will strike a bargain with you.
I agree to cut out everything you don’t like, if you will peaceab y
give me the magazines.”
So the offending Michael Angelo was cut out and one or two
other illustrated articles. These the Turk put in an enve ope
in order to send them to Constantinople, so he said, and Murray
returned in triumph with the mutilated magazines.
“ They are a queer lot,” said Murray. “ Do you remember our
experience on the way to Haifa?”
I did, and laughed at the recollection of the scene whe
my husband appeared, for the first and last time, in the
role of a violent assaulter, attacking three men at the same
The Custom House had passed the greater part of our baggage,
but suddenlv spied a quantity of Murray’s tubes containing paint.
Evidently the officials thought them some sort of internal
machines and refused to deliver them. Murray opened one ot
them and made signs on his face for the purpose of explaining
that they were to be used for painting pictures of people. But they
took it to mean that they were cosmetics to improve his complex­
ion, and as they understood the use of these, for many Oriental
2 2 8 M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
women were made up, they decided to pass them as toilet articles.
While this long parley was going on I had returned to the
boat, to order a deck-chair brought, which we had forgotten,
and when I came back I was amazed to see my husband violently
shaking two men, whom he had by the collars, and kicking a
third in front of him, while a fourth was rapidly gathering our
luggage from three carriages and piling it in a fourth. Murray
was smiling blandly, although he was jerking and kicking most
vigorously, and I said to him:
“ Murray, what on earth are you doing?”
“ These three scamps,” he explained, “ were piling our baggage
in three different carriages, dragging it away from the man I had
engaged. As I couldn’t explain in Arabic, and they speak neither
English, French, German, nor Italian, there was nothing for it
but to hold the three, while the fourth gathered the baggage;
lucky there were not more of them, as I had only one leg left to
stand on.
“ I keep myself in good training for these occasions,” said
Murray, with an unruffled calm. “ Once or twice I had to knock
men down in the Paris studios who were insulting the models.
In one of the students’ studios there was a foul-mouthed young
Frenchman. I stood him as long as I could, and finally, after
giving him several warnings, I picked him up bodily, and fastened
him in the lavatory. There was a pitched battle between the
English and French students, but we won, and I did not release
him until night. Some of the French students were fine fellows,
and better artists, as a rule, than the English, but this young man
contaminated the air. After this incident our wise French master
was good enough to dismiss him from the studio, and we were
never troubled with him again.
“ So, you see, it is a useful thing sometimes to have a muscular
length of limb, even though the makers of beds, theatre seats,
etc., take no account of the fact that some men are taller than
others and need more room.”
I realized the truth of his assertion that muscle is of use, for
the Arabs he had now released made him the most elaborate
salaams, looking up at his six feet four inches with evident
respect.
So our amusing little adventures and memory of adventures,
with a welcome pile of fresh magazines and Murray’s music,
gave us a most pleasant day’s rest. Filled with the Peace of God,

we took, in the evening, a short walk by the sea, under the Oriental
stars, which ended our happy little festival.
Many times has the memory of this blessed day returned to
me, for it was the last anniversary of our wedding which we were
to spend together on earth.

who was a polygamist.
The three brothers were in dispute, and finally, when alone
in Haifa, I was called by the three as arbitrator, hence I am well
acquainted with their history, our acquaintance having extended
over twenty-five years.
During my stay in Haifa I have been led to interest myself
especially in three persons. Frau F., the elderly daughter of the
founder of the German Colony, a refined and religious woman,

her, through His help, with a more joyous hope and courage.
The second was Carlos, of whom I will speak later.
The third was Bedi-Allah, the youngest surviving son of
Baha’o’llah.
He was a political prisoner in St. Jean d’Acre for a number
of years, and I found that he and his family of seven persons
were about to starve. So I helped them to the best of my
ability.
When he was released later, at the time the Young Turks
came into power, my task grew more trying, for I found that
both he and an able-bodied brother-in-law, living in his home,
still failed to exert themselves seriously in order to make a
living. As they had very little property, they were always in diffi­
culty, and often the Voice bade me help them, until I had spent
on them a very considerable sum of money. It had been difficult
under these circumstances to keep my vow, to give, to forgive,
to believe, especially when the following circumstances arose:
I had been going through a long period of money stress, made
the more difficult by the drain on my purse through Bedi-Allah.
Finally, I received an unexpected sum of money, and began to
breathe freely after a prolonged anxiety about ways and means.

or two after, and asked me to let him have four hundred pounds.

the money, but in vain. .
It had been very difficult under these circumstances to keep my

overcome, and it seemed to me that I had done what Christ
meant me to do; although I could not see what good purpose it
had served, and hence it was an act of blind obedience.
It was about this time the three brothers, Abbas, Mohammed
Ali, and Bedi-Allah, desired me to act as arbitrator in order to
settle the disputes between them, Abbas Effendi adding:
want you to look well into the affair of Halim Effendi. Bedi-
Allah had already confessed how foolish he had been in yielding
to the entreaties of Halim Effendi, and with a good deal of
effort I had forgiven him; hence it was not necessary for me to
investigate this detail. I had obtained from Halim Effendi a legal
acknowledgment of the loan, but it was useless, as he had no
money and no property upon which I could levy.
In looking into the affairs of the three brothers, at their own
request I found that Baha’o’llah, the father, had given a Testa­
ment to each son, and that Abbas Effendi had declined to show
his Testament; and, thus declining, had claimed, on the strength
of the concealed document, an arbitrary power over the younger
brothers, both temporal and spiritual. This they justly resented.
I therefore asked the three brothers to meet, preferably at the
tomb of their father (their sacred place), in order to read the three
Testaments before witnesses, chosen from the followers of each

In the town of St. Jean d’Acre, across the bay of Haifa, live
three brothers, Abbas Effendi, Mohammed Ali Effendi, and Bedi-
Allah Effendi, who are the sons of the three wives of Baha’o’llah,
who was a polygamist.
The three brothers were in dispute, and finally, when alone

But my relief did not last long, for Bedi-Allah came a week

When I attained this balance the Voice said, “ Give.
Later Bedi-Allah confessed to me that he had asked for this
money,’four hundred pounds, in order to save from exposure
a Turk whom we will call Halim Effendi, and who had been
robbing a Government strong-box put temporarily under his
charge. , ,
When Bedi-Allah saw that through his foolish act 1 was
reduced again to poverty, he was very sorry and tried to get bac
the money, but in vain.
It had been very difficult under these circumstances to keep my

Abbas made no reply.
I then sent him another letter, which Emin Abdoul Nour
Effendi, the honorary dragoman of the English Consulate, was
good enough to deliver to him, and the English Consul was so
courteous as to pay him a visit, both acting in an unofficial
capacity. Abbas Effendi said to these gentlemen, in the presence
of Colonel Bedray Bey, Commander of the garrison of St. Jean
d’Acre, that he refused my request to read the Testament. The
excuse he offered to me was that his father had asked him to keep
the Testament a secret, but as Abbas had previously stated to me
that he had read the Testament to Colonel Bedray Bey, a state­
ment which Bedray Bey confirmed, and as he, Abbas, said to
Emin Abdoul Nour Effendi, that he had sent copies of the Testa­
ment to the Shah and the Sultan, the Testament was no longer
a secret, if Abbas spoke the truth. Hence I said to him that
according to his own admission there was no excuse on the score
of secrecy for withholding the Testament from his brothers,
whom it most concerned, and then to claim an almost unlimited
control of family affairs and money on the strength of this
unproved Testament.
Abbas, however, persisted in his refusal to read the Testament;
and therefore it was impossible to come to an amicable arrange­
ment between the brothers. Hence they and their followers are
still divided, to this day, into antagonistic groups.
As a rule a man who wishes justly to administer a last Will and
Testament does not insist on concealing it. But be that as it may,
the following facts are certain:
Abbas Effendi and his family live comfortably, whereas Bedi-
Allah and his family would almost have starved had I not come
to the rescue.
It is true that Bedi-Allah might have made a living, had he
been a man of resource, even though he was robbed of his
patrimony; but as Abbas Effendi also is not a wage-earner, he,
as well as Bedi-Allah, would have been poverty-stricken had he
no means of support.
There are three sources from which Abbas Effendi could reap
his income. From his father’s property; from the Persian followers
of the family, each faithful Behai binding himself, so I am told,
to give nineteen per cent, of his income; and from his European
and American admirers. Whatever benefits he receives from these

them all as a Behai. It is scarcely likely, then, that Baha’o’llah,
the father, the Persian followers of that father, and the foreign
admirers of that father, intend the one Behai, Abbas, to live at
ease out of the moneys thus received in trust for the family and
the Society; and the other Behai, Bedi-Allah, to be deprived of
these three sources of income to such an extent that he and his
children have been in want.
I understand that Mohammed Ali, the second son, is as great
a sufferer, having been saved from extreme poverty only by the
exertions of some relatives in America.
For a short time Abbas gave to Bedi-Allah a small allowance,
which he withdrew when Bedi-Allah emancipated himself from
his tyrannical control; and afterwards he paid, irregularly, a very
small sum to Bedi-Allah’s mother-in-law, thereby ignoring all
just claims, and substituting, instead, a very meagre charity to
one of his relatives, a sum which cannot be depended upon.
Abbas claims that Bedi-Allah himself refused to accept a
monthly sum from him; when I repeated this assertion to Bedi-
Allah, he dryly said: “ Let him try me, and see whether I will
refuse money which is rightfully mine.”
I repeat these details, as the admirers of Abbas claim that he,
although he conceals the Will, is justly generous to his brothers.
If the numerous Christian followers of Abbas Effendi, in
England and America, consider this a noble course of action, their
ideas of brotherly love must be, so it seems to me, somewhat
peculiar.
I have known Bedi-Allah for twenty-five years. He has visited
me in my home for weeks at a time; hence I have had ample
opportunity to study his character.
He is a well-bred gentleman, amiable and generous. He will
never be a virile personality, but under European influence he
has now become what he calls “ quick and sharp” ; namely, he is
far more effectively energetic. He is a truly religious man, and
has the fortitude religion confers.
But for years he seemed to be almost paralysed by the influence
which Abbas Effendi exerted on his yielding, gentle nature. The
members of the family have told me that after an interview with
Abbas, he could neither eat nor sleep, and fell into fits of violent
trembling. But whatever he suffered, he bore it with a forgiving
patience, silently and manfully.

Finally the yoke became unbearable, as was plain to those who
knew him as well as I did, and he sent a cry to his Maker from the
depths of his being to deliver him from this mysterious tyranny.
The answer was instantaneous, for all dread of his brother left
him.
From that time he has been a changed person, growing rapidly
into an ever more energetic manhood. He wishes his brother
well, but the power he exerted over him is broken, and he feels
himself to be a free man, although a very poor one.
When I had given all that it was possible, having even reduced
myself to the point where I scarcely had enough to eat, I appealed
to Abbas Effendi, but in vain. He refused to repay me any of
the money I had given.
After Bedi-Allah was delivered from the strange influence of
Abbas, I came to like and respect him more and more. He had
not a complex European mind, and it was sometimes very hard
to find matters of mutual interest to talk about, but he was a
trustworthy friend and a pure-minded man, the most faithful
Oriental I have found among the Orientals, so I realized that
the Voice, in urging me to do what I could to influence and
energize him, had guided me well; hence I do not regret that I
was led to interest myself in this good man.
Also it is through him that I have come in close touch with
the Behais, so that my long and intimate knowledge of them may
serve as a guide to the European and American followers of
Babism, a numerous company, so I am told.
It may be that Baha’o’llah ordained, in the Testament hidden
by Abbas, this cruel difference in the condition of the three
brothers; but if so, the love which he, Baha’o’llah, is said by his
enthusiastic Christian followers to bear to the whole human race,
must have blinded him to the duties he owed his nearest of kin.
Bedi-Allah had no vices; he did not drink nor even smoke,
his household was simply ordered and his clothing plain; hence
his want did not come from riotous and extravagant living. He
was in want because his very small income could not be made
to cover the expenses of even the simplest life. Aware of his
suffering, I was led to help him to such an extent that I was
myself in want.
I understand that there are at least three million Christians who
are followers and admirers of Abbas Effendi. This scarcely seems
possible, but if it be true, then it is for these people to determine
2
} 5
TH E BEHAIS (OR BABISTS)
whether a man of the character of Abbas Effendi, letting his
brother almost starve while he lived most comfortably, is fitted
to teach Christians a more Christ-like mode of life.
I have gone into some detail with regard to the knowledge I
possess concerning Abbas Effendi for the sake of these followers.
But the man is of comparatively little consequence compared
with the larger question to be considered:
Is there any evidence to show that Christians are well advised
in following any sect, .no matter where it may be found, which
does not accept Jesus Christ as the supreme King of men?
May we discover, either in the material or the spiritual life of
the Orient, any sign that we, the followers of Christ, should
look for fresh light to those who place Him—if they honour
our Lord and Saviour at all—not as the Master of mankind, to
be supremely worshipped, but respect Him only as one in a
group of inspired prophets ?
Has the Orient given any practical proof that it may give to
us a higher knowledge, lead us to a fuller light?
The Christians who believe that the Behais are fitted to bring
a new knowledge to the Christian world, claim that they, being
the most enlightened of the Oriental sects, are also fitted to teach
the Orient.
This last claim may be quite true, and to this extent I readily
accept the valuation put upon the Behais by their Christian
admirers, for this sect holds a number of high ideals.
Let us concede, then, that the religion of the Behais is the
purest Oriental religion.
The admirers of the Behais claim, in addition, that they are
distinguished by a practical efficiency which we, the followers of
Christ, may profitably imitate.
A book, written by an Englishman, which lies before me,
claims that: “ Christianity as a civilization is completely, con­
spicuously a failure,” and the writer suggests that the weaknesses
existing in Christ’s Mission and Message are to be corrected by
Baha’o’llah; through him “ could the world learn its unity.”
The suggestion is that Christ’s work is “ parochial,” whereas
Baha’o’llah’s mission is world-wide, all-embracing.
Accepting, then, the estimate of the Christian admirers of
Behaism, I have had, according to these admirers, the opportunity
during twenty-five years, of observing closely the leaders of the
most enlightened Oriental religion, and what do I find?
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
236
I discover, on the practical plane, that in all the years the
family of Baha’o’llah have lived in their home, they have not had,
the last I knew of them, the energy to build a well or cistern such
as is possessed by every smallest German cottage, nor the enter­
prise to make a decent road to their house.
None of the sons of Baha’o’llah have done any practical,
wage-earning work; Bedi-Allah is beginning to be “ quick and
sharp,” but he has become so, not under Oriental but under
European influence, exercised over many years before a result
could be seen.
In short, the Behais are Orientals, and the difference between
a Christian civilization and the backwardness of the Oriental
races, so far as my experience goes, is constantly emphasized
to me in my daily walks on Mount Carmel. I have only to look
out of my windows to perceive the contrast writ large before
my eyes:
Looking out of one window I see a Christian Colony. In
twenty short years they have erected sanatoria, built good
houses, and made solid roads; have planted trees and vineyards;
have dug cisterns and reclaimed the soil so that it may be culti­
vated ; in short, they have turned that portion of Mount Carmel
which they own into a garden spot. Looking from the opposite
window at the rest of Carmel, the Oriental portion back of the
Christian Colony, I see, as far as the eye can reach, two poor huts
with unglazed holes for windows, no trees, no cultivation, no
attempt of any kind to redeem and utilize the land. The fellaheen
cut down for charcoal the few trees that grow, and rarely plant
new ones. This is the progress that a non-Christian race has made
in several hundred years, as compared to the progress which a
Christian race has made in twenty years.
And this difference may be traced everywhere. The laws and
customs of that part of the Orient with which I am familiar are
bad, whereas the laws and customs of Christian civilization, if
not perfect, are centuries ahead of the products of non-Christian
nations.
So far as my observation goes, I have never known a person
who was not a Christian, or directly and constantly under the
influence of Christians, to do his best. Everywhere among the
non-Christian nations there is slackness, physical, mental, moral,
and spiritual, wherever I have had an opportunity of studying
them, and the sons of Baha’o’llah, although far more civilized
TH E BEH AIS (OR BABISTS) 237
than the average, are not miracles, who may escape from, and
rise above, the general law. Behais of the younger generation
are developing fine characters, among whom I find good and
respected friends, but that development has taken place under
Christian teaching.
Thus, I have no fault to find with the Babists, but quite the
contrary, for I like and honour them, proved by the fact that I
have made serious sacrifices for them, but my message concerns
the so-called Christians who prefer to be led by a Babist and to
dethrone our glorious King, Jesus Christ, as the supreme Guide
of this earth, a Guide who stands, even from the historical
standpoint, above every other inhabitant of this earth.
I do not blame any Oriental Sect for this backwardness, for it
is impossible for me to trace their ancestral influences; but I
can affirm, because of my long experience in this land, that when
a Christian asserts that he may look to an Oriental to find a fresh
impetus Christ-ward, it is like saying that the sun must seek fresh
light from the lamp of an automobile. The lamp may serve a
use which the sun does not serve, and the Orient may teach us
some lessons, but those lessons are few and limited. It is we,
supplying the Orient with almost all that it needs, who are the
teachers; and not they, receiving the fruits of our multiform
energies, who must instruct us.
We, the Christian nations, build the schools, the hospitals,
the missions, the railways, the bridges, the roads, so far as my
observation goes. We discover new inventions, and put them
into use; we teach the arts and sciences; we heal and help and
energize the non-Christians everywhere; then why, doing the
brunt of the work, should we come to nations for instruction
who do little of it, but who, depending helplessly upon us, ask
for everything and give almost nothing.
The white man is not required both to carry his burden and
then humbly to ask those whose loads he bears how best he
may adjust his back to make the weight less heavy.
We, the Christian nations, manifest, then, not only the highest
spirituality and the keenest mentality, but He also teaches us how
to ensure the greatest practical success. Our King is not only
the Master Teacher of the inner man, but is also the most
successful business Administrator, His followers doing the greater
part of the practical work that is being accomplished in the
world.
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
238
In short, were we told that a tribe of Red Indians were pro­
ducing a Tennyson, a Wagner, a Benjamin Constant, or a Darwin,
we should know the affirmation to be a mistake, for the master
minds of a race are only a little above the common herd.
In the same wise when I am assured that an Oriental Behai, or
any other Oriental, can teach, as a leader, faithful, high-minded
Christians, I know this to be an error.
In short, I have liked and admired nearly all the Persian Behais
I have met; they are lovable and hold worthy ideals, and I
willingly acknowledge that in certain things we may be taught
by them. Their manners, for instance, are perfect; but the fact
remains that the greatest workers spring only from the nations
who are themselves good workers, and it is certain that it is the
peoples who acknowledge Christ as the supreme King of men,
and not the nations who fail to recognize His pre-eminence, which
do the important work of the world. Hence it is to a strenuous
and firmly established Christendom we must look for the masters
wherever great physical, mental, or moral efforts are to be made,
because the law of proportion between a base, the people, and
its apex, the master mind, ordains it.
Thus it may be quite true that the Behais rise above the
common herd in the Orient, even that they are considerably
above the general level; they are lovable and clean-minded, but
it is not true that they, or any other members of undeveloped
races, can profitably teach, and strenuously quicken to a higher
life, faithful Christians.
Yet the Christian followers of the Behais claim that this is
the mission of this Oriental sect. I have been told by Christian
followers of Abbas Effendi that I ought to keep silence concerning
the facts I have set forth, not because this sect may do good in
the Orient, which doubtless is quite true, but because it is doing
good, so it is affirmed, among several million Christians.
I consider this sacrilege, and whatever influence I possess will
be used to the utmost of my ability against such a claim as this,
and for the following reason:
This sect holds that Baha’o’llah is greater than Christ. I have
asked the question point-blank of his son, and he has told me
that this is their belief.
I put the question to him in this plain form:
“ Do you consider Jesus Christ to be greater than your father,
or do you consider your father to be greater than Jesus Christ?”
TH E BEHAIS (OR BABISTS) 239
He answered without a moment’s hesitation, “ I consider my
father to be greater than Jesus Christ.”
If this is the irreverent attitude we take, if we are prepared to
say, as the Behais believe, that Baha’o’llah is greater than Christ,
and hence can exert a wider influence, can wake a more potent
life, than can our Saviour—if this is our attitude, then we are not
Christians, and if the Lord says, “ I know you not,” when we come
face to face with Him, we shall have no right to complain.
Those of us who feel the Presence of Christ; those of us who
know that He is closer to us than is our own being; those of us
who realize that this Lover, intimate as He is, gathers in His own
world-wide soul every throb of terrestrial life, in order to raise it
heavenward; we, His adorers, who worship Him as a supreme
Master, as an all-potent King, we repudiate with all our strength
the claim that any human being can fill His place or extend the
scope of His work, no matter how lofty an instrument he may
be; and when any ordinary mortal is set up as a Master, while
ignoring Jesus Christ, I am filled with a righteous wrath.
It is not a fitting thing to benefit by all the immense advantages
which a Christian civilization confers, and while inheriting the
prestige of the nationalities acknowledging Him as King,
disloyally to exalt to a pre-eminence wholly undeserved, any
Oriental sect which refuses to revere Him as the Supreme Master
of men.
This truth applies especially to the women of Christendom,
who, were they indeed Orientals, would soon find themselves
shorn of their most precious privileges.
To accept all the benefits Christ, our Master, has conferred,
and then ungratefully to ignore Him, or in the slightest degree
to bemean Him, is not this a despicable course of action?
We Christians may teach these Oriental sects humbly, gently,
perseveringly; and we can also be taught by them, but to claim
that we can learn a new Christianity from men who place Christ
below the level of these sects, this view-point is a distorted one.
Is it possible that we have lost our passion for Jesus Christ?
If so, a blight has fallen upon the earth.
The reader may ask: “ Have we not free will, and may not a
Christian elect to exalt Baha’o’llah, or Buddha, or any other
Oriental prophet, to the level of Christ, or even above our Re­
deemer, if he chooses to do so?”
240 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
A man or a woman has a right to select any master he or she
desires, but no one has the right to deny Christ and to claim
Christian privileges. If a man or woman chooses an Oriental
master or an Oriental religion, let him or her live in the midst
of the civilization evolved by that master and that religion,
and not claim the music, the art, the literature, the inventions,
and the organized administration of Christendom, while denying
the supreme position of the King under whom these results are
obtained. This truth applies especially to women. If a woman
prefers an Oriental religion, she should accept the status of an
Oriental woman, and not shelter herself under Christ’s mantle
in order the better to stab Him.
It is earnestly to be hoped that, in the end, there will be not
only Protestant Christians and Catholic Christians, but also
Jewish Christians, Buddhist Christians, Mohammedan Chris­
tians, Behai Christians, etc. It would be a great calamity were
all the rich differences which have been developed through
centuries of toil to be obliterated: God forbid that the Church
Universal shall be a monotonous Church, seeking to make Pro­
testant and Catholic and Jew and Buddhist and Behai, etc., all
alike. Nowhere in the vast Cosmos do we see individuality thus
foolishly sacrificed; and hence we may believe that the God of
the Cosmos will carefully preserve to the last fibre all wealth­
adding differences.
But nowhere must Jesus Christ be dishonoured by being
placed below, or even on a level with, other prophets and
teachers. He is supreme, but the fact that He is pre-eminent need
not lessen, in the slightest degree, the dignity of the lesser
prophets. Because a Buddhist loves Christ more, he need not
love his own great and good Buddha less, for so divine is love,
and so unlike material wealth, that it grows, instead of being
robbed, in the degree that it is widely lavished, and chooses for
the lavishing the worthiest objects.
It is doubtless true, then, that other nations, less developed
than Christendom, and destined to be taught rather than to
teach, may for a time profitably follow lesser leaders, both for
the benefit of the leaders and the led. And these lesser prophets
need never be given a lower place in the estimation of those who,
until now, have been wisely guided by these great ones whom
they have chosen. It is not necessary to honour any good child
241
TH E BEHAIS (OR BABISTS)
of God less, because Christ is honoured supremely. There is
praise and to spare for all those whom He has sent forth. For
instance, were a converted Jew to lose the magnificent heritage
he is able to bring to the Commonwealth, were he to be made
after the same pattern as are those of us who do not belong to
this foundation-family, how immense would be the loss, both
to him and to ourselves, who can learn much from him.
But retaining all the priceless results of his stern training, all
the splendid lore of his own prophets, he and every other child
of God must, in the end, acknowledge that Christ stands above
all others, if we are to secure a perfect Unity because we move
under the one Being who has proved Himself to be a supreme
Master.
Those of us who follow Him must see to it, then, that our
voices proclaiming Him as the King of the earth reach, with
no uncertain sound, to the ends of the world.
Alas, we Christians are still very faulty; but however backward
we may be, let us not be guilty of the fatal sin of bemeamng our
Saviour to whom we owe everything.
Q
ARM AGEDDO N U N DER TURKISH RU LE
T h e r e was one discordant element in our harmonious lives—
Mustafa, the dissipated Arab I had seen on the boat, who had
stared at me throughout the night, was our trial, our mysterious
trial, made the more difficult because it became, as time went
on, a more and more incomprehensible test of faith.
Soon after our arrival in Haifa, Mustafa presented himself,
and told us he had been employed by Mr. Oliphant in legal
affairs. On consulting my neighbours, I found that this statement
was true.
Evidently this man, whom Laurence had entrusted with his
business, was a king among his Arab fellow-lawyers, and in
addition he was a generous, helpful benefactor. But at intervals
he drank heavily; seeing, however, that these lapses did not
seem to be frequent, so far as we could discover, there was hope
for improvement, so we trusted.
A scheme then matured in our minds in answer to our constant
prayer that we might be of service in this land where the poor,
especially widows and their children, were cruelly dealt with,
being robbed, often, by the Turkish Government.
We were led, presently, to make an arrangement with Mustafa,
whereby he would become the defender of the poor, when legally
cheated, and serve them at our expense.
In addition, when the Turkish Government some time later
put Armageddon, in the Plain of Esdraélon, up for sale at auction,
I was guided to seek to hold in my own name this celebrated
spot, accepted by experts as the real Armageddon which, so
Biblical prophecy foretold, is to be typical of the work I had
been given to do, for the triumph of Armageddon insures the
final fall of Babylon, the harlot (see Rev. xvi). Hence it seemed
a fitting thing, as I had been commanded to devote my fife to
this work, that Armageddon should stand, if possible, in my name.
As the fellaheen themselves had instructed the Government to
sell it at auction, and we were asked to buy it, I was not robbing
anyone, should I be able to acquire the title to this thousand acres
of very fine land.
It seemed a remarkable turn of fate that I should not only come
ARMAGEDDON UNDER TURKISH RULE 243
to this land, as my vision had prophetically foretold, when a
strange new environment was flashed before me as I swung in a
hammock among the clustering roses of an Indiana garden—
not only this vision was now fulfilled, but through circumstances
yet stranger I was having conferred upon me the honour of
being the proprietor of the one spot on earth historically typi­
fying, in the Holy Bible, the struggle to establish Purity, to which
I had been asked to devote my life. For the triumphant end of
the battle of Armageddon was ensured when Babylon, the type
of harlotry, met its doom.
This offer asking me to buy Armageddon, this coincidence,
strengthened my faith, and it is well that the mission I had been
asked to undertake was thus emphasized, for all the trust in God
I could muster was needed ere the end came.
For no final settlement of Armageddon was ever reached by
the Turkish Government, excuse on excuse being offered, until
a catastrophe left my life empty, unprotected, and I had to fight
the seemingly hopeless battle alone.
So long have been the various trials to which I have been
subjected that they have lasted from the last decade of eighteen
hundred up to 1927, and during this time I have not advanced,
by the fraction of an inch, in finally settling my heavily burdening
undertakings—undertakings which, so I had been led to believe,
were dictated from Above. Yet, in actuality, my affairs were simple
enough, for Armageddon had been bought, paid for, and finally
the deeds were in perfect order, being made out correctly in
my name and registered in the Government books as my
property.
Had I not believed, and continued to believe, without a shadow
of doubt, in Christ our Lord, I should have fainted and failed
long ago, growing ever more pessimistic and embittered as incom­
prehensible injustice after injustice helplessly victimized me.
But instead of being tempted to despair, a splendid law has
comforted me: Christ revealed to me that, by forgiving those
who ill use us, we may raise structure on structure, fitly building
His Kingdom; and if He is well served nothing else matters.
Next to Love, His most insistent command is to forgive those
who injure us, and so instead of destroying we may ever construct.
On this foundation, written on every particle in Creation, so my
Philosophies contend, namely the law of mediation ordaining
that loss may ensure fresh gain—through this law no Christian
244 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
who loves his fellow-men need ever despair, for though he lose
all things, yet shall he ever gain all treasures, not only for himself
but for those who have despoiled him, if, in the end, his enemies
become his humbled friends.
Thus vis-viva (living force), i.e. the utilization of disintegration
in a renewed integration, to use a scientific expression, may
conquer wherever union triumphs over disunion, order over
disorder.
Because of this Law, the Scheme of God is a magnificent one,
ever building anew out of destruction.
How, then, can those of us who believe in Him ever fail, when
out of failure Heaven and Earth may be splendidly exalted, a
fact most simply set forth by telling us that he who loses his
life gains it. This Law may be more elaborately explained through
science, as has been hinted.
Who has the right to despair in a Scheme where loss may always
ensure gain, so my Philosophies seek to prove.
Thus I discovered that I, hailing from Posey County, Indiana,
U.S.A., had come to own, by a turn of the wheel of fate, a large
tract in the plain of Armageddon.
But the strange fact remains that up to the present my property

access, and hence possessed every physical attribute a property
can have. As we rode along, the beauty and the historical
interest of the scene possessed me. Nazareth, Samaria, the hills
of Galilee, Mount Tabor, the Mount of Transfiguration, and
Mount Carmel are all visible from Armageddon.
A brooding peace rested on the Plain of Esdraelon, which has
known in the past such fierce conflicts. Exquisitely shaded tints
veiled the surrounding mountains, the strange glamour of the
Oriental atmosphere gathering the varied scene into a magnificent
unity. The delight of it was so great I was almost forced to cry
aloud, “ How mighty is God when even His poor earth seems so
heavenly,” and yet this loveliness was then cursed by a hand of
death, for everywhere the Turkish Government paralysed
industry by its tyrannous laws, founded neither on common
sense nor on justice.
This splendid expanse has been made as useless as it could be
made, not by the wars which formerly raged here, but by an
unseen thing called “ The Law.” All the long carnage which has
soaked this soil with blood has not been so destructive as are
the grim and silent spectres of Turkish tyranny and of Turkish
inefficiency.

But the strange fact remains that up to the present my property
might as well have been situated in the moon, so far as any prac­
tical benefit to myself, the legal owner thereof, is concerned,
although it is the best land in Palestine. This estate stretches
away from the foot of protecting mountains, a rich, smooth
soil, where scarcely a stone is to be found and the lands of the
village are watered by many ever-running springs, a great boon
in a land where not a drop of rain falls for five or six months.
Later, when a carriage road was made to Jenin, I passed the land
one perfect February day, and a more beautiful, interesting,
practically useful property I have never seen. Yet during the
many years I have owned this large and fertile tract, bought from
the Turks, it has profited me nothing and cost me a great deal.
The unseen hand of an utterly bad Government has robbed this
extensive estate of all value. “ There is no better land in the whole
of the United States,” so a relative of mine, an American land-
owner touring in Palestine, declared when he saw it; “ it is a
splendid property.” When I first owned it, it was in an out-of-
the-way place, but later, when the Hedjaz Railway was built,
it was near Afoulfc, the second station out of Haifa, and so soon as
ARM AGEDDON UNDER TURKISH RU LE 245
the projected railway to Nablous should be constructed, it would
lie in the angle of the two roads.1 The land was then easy of

Did true Christians own this splendid Plain, a miracle would be
wrought; a spirit of fruitfulness, of industry, of resourcefulness,
would move the stagnant air with energetic wings, an in ten
years it would pulse with life, where now there is only silence
and solitude. But true Christians are rare.
Had not experience taught me, through long and poverty-
stricken years, that an unseen hand can pluck the bread Irom
one’s lips, that invisible chains can bind and torment helpless
sufferers, I should not have believed it—I should have said,
“ A splendid property remains a splendid property, and it does
not matter whether it is cultivated under Christ or under Moham­
med.” I have found out my mistake through the ownership ot
Armageddon.
I have discovered that endless exasperations, futile ettorts,
hopeless confusion, unchecked trickery, unreproved treachery,
useless legal expense, may torment and rob a victim to the point
of reducing him or her to want, simply because Mohammed and

not Christ was still the Master of the Turkish Dominions; and
what is true of Turkey is doubtless true of other lands, where
He is not acknowledged as King. Let, then, those who seek
to destroy His Law and Order take heed, for they know not
what they do.
Christians are not what they ought to be; it is sadly true that
we fall far below His ideals, more shame to us; but with all our
shortcomings it is only we, the Christian Governments, who
are fitted to be masters of the world, and where we do not reign
there is chaos.
Heathendom stupidly ignores all the resources Christendom
has learnt to utilize. It behoves us, then, to take our true place
and to govern the earth, for, if we fail to do so, the heathen
peoples of this globe will be to us a continual torment. Mercifully
mastered, they will follow in a submissive usefulness; unmastered,
their destructiveness will move as a giant, although their con­
structiveness is only as a pigmy. They can kill, but they cannot
create; let us see to it, then, that we, who are learning to build
rather than to destroy, shall not shirk our responsibilities as the
monarchs of this world. I may speak as one having authority
through a long and bitter experience, so far as the Turkish
Dominions are concerned, and to my amazement, when Great
Britain succeeded Turkey, I was not one whit better off, because
so few Government officials ask Christ for His advice and strictly
obey His commands.
My faith has been strained sometimes to the breaking point
during these long years. For in the teeth of every discouragement,
and in spite of an almost incessant opposition, often inclining
to ridicule, I have had to persevere, because a small Voice,
heard by no one but myself, told me to do so.
Yet every Christian knows that His followers are asked at times
to obey blindly, no matter what it costs, and that deep down there
is a conviction, “ I must follow this road where He bids me walk,
though all men oppose me and it leads me, incomprehensibly,
at last only into an abyss.”
The perseverance which persists only where there is success
is not faith, but only the worldly instinct which works for gain.
For the faith which opens the gates of Heaven must arise, re­
freshed, to press forward anew, when a black darkness hides
every inch of the way, save the one immediate step to be taken.
ARM AGEDDON UNDER TURKISH RULE 247
No human creature, who is weakly discouraged, easily depressed,
erratically emotional, unsteady in aim, and constantly seeking
rewards, will reach God’s Paradise; for a resolution which cannot
be broken by any fate whatsoever is required to endow one
with the strength needed to walk from earth to Heaven.
This lesson I learnt through my ownership of Armageddon,
as I have not been taught it through any other experience, and, in
addition, Satan has discovered that where Christ is loved, he
cannot succeed, though every advantage is conceded to him, the
evil one, and on the other side stands only a faith unrepaid. The
full story of this testing experience will follow in due course.
But, for the moment, we are only at the beginning of the Story
of Armageddon. Murray and I were still together, helping each
other, and the one discordant element in our home was Mustafa.
We were led to continue to work for this man to the utmost,
for the purpose of making him, as I have said, a fit lawyer for
the oppressed poor of Syria, some of whom suffer every indignity
helplessly. He was at that time remarkably clever. He knew the
law of the land well, he had great power with the Government,
and he was what is known as good-hearted: namely, he had
generous instincts and was not a hard skinflint of a man. He
helped those in distress, and he was capable of affection. He was
the person we needed to do a pressing humanitarian work, as well
as our own legal business.
He was not a well-groomed man at any time, and when he was
drunk he was a disgusting object, spreading what is for me the
hardest physical discomfort, a most offensive smell. I love clean
air, and I could scarcely endure his presence.
Yet we were told to let him come in when he would, drunk or
sober, and Murray often rose at four in the morning and went to
Mustafa’s home in the Arab town in order to be with him when
he woke and keep him from drink. It was a strange sight to see
my tall, graceful, handsome husband walking about with this
Arab, disgusting when he was drunk.
But could we redeem him, he would be able to do a work for
the oppressed of the land which we could not do. So it remained
our intention to pay him a salary, squeezed as best we could out
of our income, and to employ him as a lawyer wherever the down­
trodden, unable to defend themselves, needed help. But we
laboured on, month after month, without making, so far as we
248 M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
could see, much progress, and yet God said, “ Persevere,” al­
though Mustafa had now become addicted to that fatal tiring
absinthe.
Once only during the long years of this trial did I fail to do
something which I knew I ought to do; and, through His help,
my lapse from duty lasted only three minutes.
We had had Mustafa in the house in one of his worst lapses,
during three days and nights, raving like a dangerous madman.
He had to be incessantly watched by one or the other of us, and
he so befouled the house with his filth, vomiting everywhere,
that my English servants threatened to leave me, saying they
could not endure it.
At the end of the third day of this delirium, Murray had gone
out for a few moments on some errand, and I was alone with
Mustafa. Suddenly my strength gave way, and I felt I must lie
down. I knew I ought not to do so, that Mustafa would get
away with the craving for drink still devouring him, and that I
must be on the alert every moment. But I threw myself on a
couch, knowing I was doing wrong, and lay there for three
minutes. I rose just in time to catch him at the front door and to
force him, mainly by strength of will, to return. With the excep­
tion of this lapse, I have neglected nothing in all these years that
my conscience told me that I ought to do in connection with
this battle between good and evil. Yet at the end of this long
period there is no tangible result, nothing the world would
recognize as a work accomplished. Victories have been won in
the sight of God, so I believe, but so hidden are they that scarcely
a human being gives me the credit of them; on the contrary, I
have been ridiculed and sometimes bitterly attacked throughout
my work. Yet I am told to persevere in this seemingly useless
task, and it has taken so much resolution to obey, that I am per­
suaded by this experience alone that there is a God, for my frail
human strength unaided would have failed me in the first three
months of my trial. “ Why,” the self-preserving voice of reason
would have said to me, “ why should you destroy the peace of
your blessed home for the sake of a filthy Arab, especially when
you see so little result? Why?” This question I was not able to
answer, nor have I been able to answer it during many long years,
as the changing phases of this task, always difficult and seemingly
fruitless for the most part, have piled up their burdens. But
though I could not answer this Why ? which, at times, seemed to
ARM AGEDDON UNDER TURKISH RULE 249
grow colossal, I knew that God was answering for me, “ Because
I command it.”
At times a lurid chaos flashes before me which seems to be
physical, a vision which appears to indicate that there will be some
material, outward strife, some terrible Armageddon; this may well
be so, for an outward sign may profitably precede, as a warning,
an inward, a spiritual struggle.1
But the real Battle of Armageddon, so I was led to perceive
more and more clearly, is a moral battle, and the context plainly
indicates that it is a sex battle, for when victory is won, Babylon,
the Mother of Harlots, falls. I have been made the owner of
Armageddon, then, because of the task given me in the beginning
of my mission. I was told to undertake the most difficult work in
the world, to cleanse, so far as my feeble strength permitted it,
sex-filth; and the harassing ownership of Armageddon is the
outward sign of my inner, my hidden responsibility; a responsi­
bility borne quite alone, in the end.
I must believe that the mighty prayers I have sent out during
these years, over the world, often and often, from the heights of
the sacred mountain where I now write—Carmel—these prayers
are answered wherever souls are ready to receive them. If Marconi-
grams can be carried, wireless, across space, surely the vibrations
of an intense beseeching may travel until they also find answering
receivers, namely the men and women who desire a holy mate-
hood.
Have I sometimes been given an actual response, coming under
my own observation? Yes. There was no flare of trumpets, no
pageantry, no recognized triumph, but I have seen coarse faces
grow innocent, even among the Arabs, when I have prayed God
to teach these sinners, who were so well acquainted with sin, to
forget it all, and to become as little children, believing only in
pure goodness.
And this book that I am writing! Am I not sending it out with
all the passion of my soul behind it, beseeching that wherever
it is read, men and women will remember how exquisite is
cleanliness of life and how unprofitable is filth, and thus sent,
will it not do its work?
What do I ask? Only this, that sex-love shall ever be a prayerful
1 Since these lines were written General Allenby’s conquering army has swept
through Syria, and an actual battle has taken place in the air, in this vicinity.
250 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
love. That no lover’s kiss shall be given, anywhere, until God is
remembered. That no mated ones shall sink into a loosely inert
sloth, when, with keenest energy, they ought to rise to Spirit
heights in order to create under God’s surveillance. I only desire
that self-control, obedience, concentration of purpose, shall
replace a loosely governed lust.
Yet simple as is this wish, were it granted the world would be
saved, for a new race of children would be born, repudiating
filth, greed, treachery, and bloody war.
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL
When the summer heat began Murray and I went up to Dalieh
on Mount Carmel, and there we had two or three weeks of
delightful respite from the cares imposed on us by Mustafa.
But our ease was short-lived, for what was supposed to be
cholera broke out in St Jean d’Acre, people falling dead in the
streets. It turned out to be very bad drainage in the end, but the
scare sent about a dozen Arabs to us for refuge, among them
being the family of Mustafa.
He and his wife slept in a room below our bedrooms, and
more and more frequently we were called on, in the night as
well as by day, to protect the poor woman from his drunken
violence.
One afternoon, when Murray had been obliged to go down to
Haifa on business, I was resting in my room after a disturbed
night, when Mustafa had been unusually brutal.
Suddenly Lisa, our English servant, appeared in my room
with distended eyes, and said that Mustafa had piled a lot of
straw mattresses the Arabs had brought with them, in one of the
downstairs rooms, had drenched them with paraffin, and was
setting fire to them to burn down the house. I hurried downstairs
and found Mustafa alone in the room, he having chased everyone
out. The affrighted Arab men and women and a number of
Druse men were looking in at the windows, afraid to tackle
Mustafa, who was drunk and raving like a madman. He was a
powerful brute of a man, very muscularly built, and, except for
the bloating effects of his drink, would have had a fine physique.
As I arrived, he was just striking a match to set fire to the
paraffined beds, piled one on the other higher than his head.
There was not a moment to lose, so I rushed into the room and
confronted him.
“ Give me those matches, this instant,” I commanded, fixing
his roving red eyes with mine. For a moment he seemed on the
point of yielding, and then with an oath he turned his back,
shouting:
“ No woman shall master me. I’d better have been born dead
than to be the slave of a woman.” I felt that all his Oriental
252 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
prejudices entered into his words; in his eyes I belonged to an
inferior grade, womankind.
I quickly confronted him again and repeated my words,
i. “ Mustafa, give me those matches, this instant.”
His eyes began to waver before mine, his head sank on his
breast, and slowly, reluctantly, he handed me the box of matches.
Then he dropped into a corner with a shivering moan, looking
like a cowed animal.
“ If he attempts any more violence, come for me at once,” I
said to Herbert and Lisa, “ and keep someone constantly on
guard.”
As I passed out through the crowd of Druse men, they looked
at me in amazement; for it was the first time, probably, that they
had seen how much stronger is the Spirit than the body. They did
not understand how a man who could have felled me with a blow,
as Mustafa was immensely stronger than I was, could be coerced
through an unseen Power.
When Mustafa was sober, he said to me ruefully:
“ I wish I had been killed when I was born, rather than to
suffer this humiliation which has come on me. To be conquered
by a woman is disgraceful.”
“ You have not been conquered by a woman,” I said, “ but by
God Almighty. I asked Him to help me and He heard my prayer.
I could have done nothing in my own strength.”
As I saw more of Mustafa, I understood why our Lord has
told us to try and save him. For a number of weeks after the above
incident he was quite sober. The mountain air clarified his brain,
and the exercise I insisted on his taking reduced his flesh. I
realized that he had, in his way, a potent personality, and that he
possessed that rare gift, eloquence. When he talked, the Arabs
and Druses drew round him to listen, and he could keep them
spellbound for an hour or two. Such a personality, set straight,
could do a great deal of good in a sphere, the lawyer’s work,
where he was master among his weaker rivals. Without doubt
he could, if he would, defend many a helpless victim, saving
them from the tyrannous grip of the Turkish Government,
especially many defrauded widows and orphans shamefully robbed
in Turkey.
The strain of looking after this large family, and of keeping
the peace among these Arabs with their dirty, irregular ways, and
253
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL
between them and my clean English servants told on me; and
one morning I awoke overtaken at last by the paralysis I had
long dreaded. I could feel nothing from the waist down, and
could not move my limbs; they were like stone.
Murray had gone to Haifa to buy provisions for our large
family and it was not time for Lisa to bring my bath-water, so I
struggled alone with the death-in-life which had seized me,
there being no one within call. I sent a cry to my Lord, strong
enough, so it seemed to me, to circle the globe. I could not lie
here paralysed and burden my dear Murray with a helpless
invalid. I must rise and look after my chaotic household, which
ram p, to grief the moment my surveillance was withdrawn. God
did not create me in order to chain me thus—my whole soul knew
that He had the power to heal me, and so I clung to Him with
every fibre of my being and would not permit the thought to
enter my mind, even for an instant, that He would refuse to help
me. My Bible lay on the table beside me, and in that book Jesus
Christ had said He would heal those who asked Him. He does
not lie; He does not hold out false promises; He means what He
says, and He has the power to do the things He binds Himself
to do, if we fulfil our part. I felt assured that He understood,
scientifically understood, every element which goes to make up
fife, every subtlest vibration which animates it; and, therefore,
He could perfectly manipulate all creative forces.
I had perceived when I had seen Him on the Altar during the
Communion Service, how stupendous was His brain power, my
own poor little intelligence almost reeling when His mental
grasp was dimly revealed to me; and so I felt assured that He could
re-create anything that the Creator had created; because, like
the Creator, He our King understands how it is fashioned.
All the resources of this earth are known to Him, every usable
combination He has mastered, in order that He may do the Work
God has asked him to accomplish. The lack was in me not in
Him; He, the divine Scientist, would and could heal me if I asked
Him, with a faith permitting no shadow of doubt.
And He did answer me, almost at once. I felt a slight warmth
descending into my legs, and it increased, moment by moment,
until I could move, slightly, one foot. Again I prayed, storming
the gates of Heaven, and the influx of life increased until I could
put both feet out of bed. As I tried to stand, I staggered and fell
back. Again I cried to my Lord and raised myself. I took one
254 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
tottering step and then another, ever imploring, until I got
across the room. There I leant, utterly exhausted, against the wall;
but only for a moment, for my Lord was waiting to hear me, I
knew. So I pled with Him again, until, step by step, I got back
to my bed. I continued to pray, incessantly, until an hour later,
when Lisa came.
I was then able to rise and with many halts to dress, and as the
day wore on my limbs grew ever more serviceable. At the end
of three days I had recovered my normal condition. Two weeks
later I had another stroke, and again Jesus Christ healed me.
From that day to this, more than thirty-five years, I have not been
paralysed, although the Lord never quite takes away the weakness
in my back, affecting me at each hand’s turn, for whenever I use
my right hand and arm I feel pain, and when I use them too
much a warning numbness. He could heal me completely, were
it best, but I am thus reminded, in almost every moment of the
day, that without Him I can do nothing. So it is well that I am
not wholly cured, and I thank Him for the weakness which keeps
me closer to Him. At the same time I am ever praying to be so
united to Him that I shall not need this urgence, and hence
He may profitably heal me, leaving no trace of the accidents which
have crippled me so many long years.
I once asked Him whether it was my duty to pray to be healed
completely, and I was turned to Malachi i, where I read these
words: “ And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And
if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Offer it now unto thy
governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?
saith the Lord of Hosts.” . . . “ Ye brought that which was torn,
and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I
accept this of your hand, saith the Lord.”
I understood from this guidance that He desires to deliver us
completely from evil the moment that our self-sufficiency dies,
and we give Him the whole of the glory. May that hour
come soon. Therefore, I ever reject weakness and affirm His
Power.
A few nights after I had recovered from the second stroke of
paralysis Murray was by my bed with my hand in his. I had
retired early as I was very tired, and he was sitting beside me until
I felt that I could go to sleep. We had just said the Lord’s Prayer,
and he was kissing me good-night, when a strange thing happened.
There was no light in the room and no moon. Outside a com-
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL 255
plete darkness reigned, and the household was in bed and asleep,
no one stirring, for it was now late.
Suddenly my breast was illumined with a phosphorescent
light.
“ Do you see that, Rosamond?” said Murray in a startled voice.
“ Yes,” I said, “ and I see a gigantic hand holding out to me a
Lily of the Annunciation. What does it mean?”
As the light faded, Murray knelt by the bed and we prayed
together with clasped hands.
When he had gone to his room, I pondered long over this
strange experience which I could not understand.
The Arabs left, and we heard a few days after that it was
necessary to send Mustafa to Beyrouth on business connected
with Armageddon and other matters.
Murray decided to go down to Haifa and to remain in Mustafa s
house, watching over him during the week or two before his
departure, as he had documents to prepare to present to the Serail
(Government) at Beyrouth; and we could never trust him when
any business was to be done. Also Murray wished to ensure
that the improvement taking place in him at Dalieh—for he was
like a new man, gifted with a remarkable capacity, during the
latter part of his stay—this improvement should be maintained.
So, for both considerations, he decided to go down to Haifa.
Two or three weeks passed before Mustafa got the papers in
order, and Murray was detained in the dirty Arab quarter during
a prolonged sirocco, often following Mustafa around the ill­
smelling town, which was like an oven, to keep him away from
the drinking shops, imported, alas, by European settlers.
Murray had little sleep at night, I was told afterwards, as the
craving for drink had again possessed Mustafa, and he had to be
constantly watched. So the days wore on, and each afternoon a
messenger brought me a cheerful letter from Murray, although,
in truth, he was labouring under an attack of Syrian fever, so
I was told later; and, in spite of it, dragged himself about the
malodorous and intensely hot streets to watch over Mustafa,
who was ever restlessly wandering about.
Finally Mustafa managed to get hold of some arrack (native
whisky) and absinthe, through one of his sons, and one morning,
rousing himself from a short sleep, Murray found him dead drunk.
He wrote me, without telling me how much he was suffering
M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PALESTIN E
256
from fever, that he thought he ought, himself, to go to Beyrouth,
as it was useless to send Mustafa.
The next I heard, Murray had left for Beyrouth, taking with
him as interpreter an English-speaking Arab, formerly in
Laurence’s employ. The Arab servant told me on his return that
the heat was almost unbearable, and Murray, with the fever upon
him, was obliged to be out in it the greater part of the day. His
room at night was like an oven.
An ever-growing anxiety drove me from room to room during
these days of waiting. I could not settle anywhere, and again and
again our last evening together came before me. So beautiful
was it that it scarcely seemed to belong to this world of care,
and the consummation of happiness we had had in these last
hours which we had spent together seemed to tell me that the
end was near.
We had passed the evening on the veranda. The wonderful
Oriental moon rode in the starlit heavens, illumining the vivid
flowers and luxuriantly climbing vines, the pomegranates, and
orange and fig trees, with a magical fight almost as bright as
day and more mystically subtle in its traceries than sunlight.
My husband lay stretched in a hammock, looking up to the moon,
and my beauty-loving eyes dwelt with great pleasure on his face,
every fine of which meant to me goodness, sweetness, purity.
Seeing that I liked him to be well dressed, he now took pains
with his clothes, and as we lived in the Orient he gave his artistic
fancy a little rein. He was clad in a well-cut suit of white flannels,
a white silk shirt, with a pretty cravat knotted under the turned-
down collar, revealing his firm column of a throat. Around his
waist was an embroidered scarf, and on his feet some scarlet
native slippers; the white costume with its touches of colour
suited him admirably, and at the same time, as he said, it was most
comfortable.
“ Ah, how I enjoy this free and simple fife,” he was saying.
“ No dress-suits with stiff shirt fronts, no late dinners, no tobacco
and wine-laden air, no tiresome form and ceremony; and, above
all, none of the remorse I suffered when at home, because I was
too luxuriously catered for, while our workmen had almost no
pleasures, save the coarse ones they snatched. Now I am free from
it all,” and he stretched his arms above his head with the gesture
of a man relieved from bondage.
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL 257
So we went on talking of many things, and at last a long, full
silence fell between us.
As I leaned back in my easy chair I realized that I was achingly
tired, exhausted by the long summer of constant care. I glanced
at my husband, and the contrast between us struck me as it had
never done before. He lay with his head pillowed on his arms, his
thick black hair was swept back from his fine brow, his uplifted
luminous eyes were beautiful, the warm, white skin, the fine
features, the strong bared throat, illumined by the radiant light
of the southern moon, seemed of an almost unearthly beauty.
I thought of my own poor little frame, aching with fatigue,
and I cried to him:
“ Murray, why did you marry an old woman like me? There
must be days when you regret that you have bound yourself
to a poor creature, who can scarcely breathe sometimes from
sheer weakness.”
Murray sprang from his hammock and knelt beside me,
clasping his hands across my knees. The moonlight illumined
his uplifted face, and it looked like the face of an angel; I have
never seen any other human being look as did Murray at that
instant, the memory of it has remained with me from that day
to this, for the aspiration of his spotless life was written there,
not in feeble lines, but in all the virile strength of his young
manhood, virginal, because so passionately pure.
He kissed my brow, my eyes, my hands, again and again, and
every kiss seemed to sanctify me anew.
“ Rosamond,” he said at last, “ I never hoped, I never believed
in all my lonely young life that it was possible for me to be as
happy as I am now. Search my soul and you will see that I speak
the truth.” His eyes gazed into mine, and in them I read what he
wished me to see, a blessed contentment so deep that I could not
fathom it.
We sat side by side with clasped hands for a long time, with
God’s peace brooding over us, too deeply blessed to speak. Then
he rose, and sweeping me up in his strong arms he carried me
upstairs to my bed.
When he kissed me good-night and good-bye, he said, “ I
shall be gone in the morning before you are up. You may expect
a letter from me every day until I return.”
In the morning, when I heard the horses before the house, I
rose in time to see Murray and the servant making their way down
R
M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
258
the bridle-path. Turning, he saw me, and whirling his hat around
his head he shouted a joyous good-bye, adding, “ I shall soon be
back.”
The hot blast of a sirocco swept into the room as I leaned out
of the window, and a fear seized me, for I knew how ill it suited
Murray’s Scotch blood. I watched him as long as I could see
him; and, at the last turning, he again bared his head, and his
powerfully vibrating voice carried back the words, “ God bless
you.” As he turned to send me this last greeting, he was the
embodiment of splendid young manhood, his alert and graceful
poise in the saddle seeming to emphasize afresh the last words
he had spoken to me when he bade me good-night:
“ Through you, Rosamond, all the future lies fair before me.”
The brow of the hill then hid my husband from view, and I
never saw him again.
In the days which followed I wandered restlessly from one
hot room to another, filled with a vague foreboding. But Murray’s
daily letters were full of cheery courage, concealing from me that
he was ill with fever and tramping the filthy streets of the furnace­
like town, in order to do his full duty by Mustafa. I think, had I
known, I could have walked to Haifa in order to drag him back
to the mountain, scorched with sirocco heat it is true, but a heat
which was clean and pure.
He then sent me word he was going to Beyrouth, and my
prayers followed him day and night. Presently he wrote that he
was returning, fixing the date. I watched all the afternoon on the
day I expected him, running many times to a vantage point
where I could get the first glimpse of him as he made his way up
the mountain. The day before his expected arrival I had been
urged to pray almost without ceasing, as for one in danger, and
when the night came and there was no news of him I grew so
anxious that I could quiet myself only by holding fast to my Lord
with every breath. Had he arrived safely, I knew he would have
sent a messenger if he could not come himself.
The next day I waited until the middle of the afternoon without
news, and then Lisa came to my room with a scared, white face
and told me Alias, the servant who had accompanied Murray,
wished to see me downstairs.
When I reached the veranda he mutely handed me a letter
from Murray. It was written on the boat, and his usually good
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL 259
and characteristic writing was indistinctly blurred, showing traces
of excitement.
I read the letter, which said: “ God has asked me to give my
life, and I have sacrificed it for His humanity’s sake.”
I turned in bewilderment to Alias, and then he told me the
whole terrible story.
“ I saw that the master had fever, when we went on board the
steamer to return to Haifa. He stretched himself in a chair on
deck and asked me not to leave him. He could not, however,
sit still long but walked the deck, talking sometimes to himself,
sometimes to me. As the night grew cooler he seemed to grow
quieter, so I went downstairs for some supper, he refusing all
food.” ’
Alias hung his head and continued in a low voice:
“ I went to sleep after supper, and when I returned to the deck,
not long before we reached Haifa, I found the master s clothes
lying in a pile, but could not find him. I gave the alarm and the
boat was searched in every part, but it was no use. He had jumped
overboard and was drowned.”
I looked in stunned horror at Alias, and then turned and went
to my room. I must be alone to think. Precious hours had passed
and no search had been made for him. He was an expert swimmer,
and the distance to land on approaching Haifa was not great.
Was he wandering, naked and crazed with fever, on land? Where
was he; oh, where was he? I rushed downstairs, ordered Alias to
go to the village and bring four strong men to carry me down to
Haifa on a stretcher. I sent Herbert on horseback down the
mountain to begin the arrangements for a search party, and to
order a carriage to meet me at Ain-Haut, the village on the plain
which a carriage could reach. I had a donkey saddled for Lisa,
and, locking up the house, which I have not seen from that hour
to this, we began our journey down the mountain, the most
terrible journey I have ever experienced.
The air was like a furnace, the fierce sun beat down on
my unprotected head, the dust, after six rainless months, rose
under the feet of my carriers, stifling me, and these Druse
carriers, seeing that the master was gone and I unprotected,
behaved like demons. Again and again they tried to throw me
from the stretcher over the steep places we passed, and they
dragged the canvas bed near the ground, whenever there were
¿rough rocks on the way, which struck my back with stunning
260 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
force. They thrust their faces into mine, shrieking over and over
again the same phrase. Evidently they were possessed by some
devilish influence, for I had always known them, formerly, as
quiet, courteous men. Alias was lagging behind in terror,so I called
him and asked what they were saying, and he finally told me that
they were cursing Murray, and saying that they hoped every dog
of a Christian would be drowned, as he had been. As we came
in sight of the sea, they gave a fiendish yell of triumph.
As the afternoon wore away, I was terrified to see a new expres­
sion on their faces. Lust was added to hate. Lisa was a pretty
young woman with a pink and white English complexion, much
admired by the natives. The two carriers who were resting, in
alternation, were pressing close to her side, and she called out to
me in terror. I signed to the men to lower the stretcher, and bade
her ride in front of me so I could watch over her.
We resumed our journey; and prostrate on my stretcher,
using all my strength to cling to its sides so that I should not
be hurled out of it, racked by the sharp rocks striking my weak
spine, blinded and dazed by the heat of the blazing sun, stifled
by the dust, deafened by the harsh screams of my carriers, shouted
with their hateful, lustful faces pressed close to mine, I had a
foretaste of hell. These were the sights and the sounds of the
infernal regions. My heart was breaking and my body seemed
unable longer to bear the strain.
But I could not give way, I must reach Haifa and institute a
search for Murray, and I must protect poor, sobbing Lisa from
these devil-obsessed men growing each moment more fiercely
lawless. We were far away from any help on this lonely mountain
path, and I must keep my senses.
Who could have dreamt, when Murray and I sat on the veranda
in the moonlight on that last blessed night, in a heaven of peace,
that I should be thus tortured, almost beyond endurance, in a
few short days. The master was gone, his protecting care was
withdrawn, his tenderly strong arms no longer upheld me, and
so these rough men believed they could torture me with impunity.
I had lived in so sheltered a sphere of love during these last years
that the change seemed more than I could bear, my brain was
reefing, my will failing, my body broken as on a rack of torture.
Then an intuition came to me; I repeated, without ceasing, the
first words of the Creed: “ I believe in God the Father Almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ His only Son our
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL 261
Lord. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven
and earth; and in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord.”
Again and again I went over the words, and I felt that they
saved my reason and cowed my obsessed tormentors.
The faith of the souls who have repeated this sacred Creed
seemed to inspire me. All the majesty and dignity of the Church
of Christ over-arched me with a protecting Power. The saints
who have believed, have ever continued to believe, during long
centuries, seemed to form a cordon around me, through which
no persecutors could break. Thus shielded from harm, I looked at
my Druse carriers with a compelling gaze, not because I was a
strong-willed woman, but because I was a Christian, inheriting
all that Christianity confers. These heathens were in error, and
I knew the truth; hence I was the master and they were my
servitors.
I signed to them to set me down, and adjusted my disordered
clothing, gathered up my streaming hair, and wiped my begrimed
face, scorched with the heat; then I looked at them, one by one,
and bade them in a tone of command to hurry on to the sea in
the few words of Arabic I knew.
They obediently took up my stretcher and we journeyed on
in silence, until I saw Herbert coming to meet us. How glad I
was to see a sturdy Englishman!
The Druses, their native courtesy restored and now humbly
apologetic, returned to Dalieh, and I lay on the ground under a
tree waiting for the carriage which was long in coming. In that
one evening spent in a fever-ridden plain, I caught a low malarial
fever, which returns even to this day. I was susceptible, probably
because I was so utterly exhausted.
We reached Haifa about two o’clock at night. The closed house
was stifling, but throwing myself on a dusty bed I slept soundly
for an hour or two out of sheer fatigue, in spite of the burning
heat.
When I went downstairs at an early hour, I found that Herbert
had been to the market and Lisa had put the dining-room in
order, the table being neatly set and a nice breakfast prepared.
It gave me a sense of comfort, in my desolation, to feel that my
faithful servants were looking after my physical well-being, and
I was very grateful to them.
I immediately organized the search-party, sending one set of
men in boats, another along the beach, and another farther
262 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
inland, to scour the country almost as far as Beyrouth. As soon as
the news spread that I had come to Haifa a crowd of our Arab
acquaintances called, and began their lamentations, howling and
gesticulating in a way which nearly drove me mad.
I was trying to get a bed ready in a lower room, to put the
house in order, and to make all the preparations necessary to
revive Murray in case he was brought home in an exhausted
condition. Several times during the day people darted in crying
that his body had been found. Visitors came and went constantly,
and I struggled on between the visits to have everything in
readiness. Finally a Lutheran pastor visiting the German colony
(but happily not one of its members) came in, and detained me
an hour. In vain I begged him to excuse me as I had much to do.
He sat there stolidly, and went on in a loud, rasping voice,
repeating :
You are a spiritualist, you hold séances in your home, and
your husband is drowned as a punishment. You are the cause of
his death.”
I assure you,” I said, “ we have never held a séance in our
home. Not that I believe God would so punish me for such a
reason, but as a matter of fact the reason does not exist, we never
had spiritualistic circles.”
Everyone says you have held séances,” he asserted over and
over, “ and everybody must be right.”
When he had gone on in a high-pitched, nasal voice for nearly
an hour, going over and over the same ground, it seemed to me
I must go into a fit of mad screaming or lose my reason. Every
sense was on the alert to hear whether they were bringing my
husband, and there was still much to do, but, short of having the
pastor carried bodily from the house, I could not make him go.
This good man was torturing me more cruelly even than the
Druses had done, and again I was tempted to ask myself the old
question : Is this all their religion is worth? O f what use are their
long, formal prayers when, in the end, these people are capable
of unjustly accusing, and cruelly tormenting, a broken-hearted
woman?”
At last he rose to go, with the words, “ I hope I have taught
you a lesson, and that you will never again be guilty of your
wicked offence and hold another séance.”
It was useless to repeat that I had not held a séance for years,
so I let him go in silence. But when, at last, he had closed the
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL 263
door, I cried to my Lord that I must have help. The fever was
mounting to my head, my spine was racked with pain from the
blows of the previous day, and every nerve was strained beyond
endurance by this last experience. In my deep distress I turned,
almost involuntarily, to seek the protection of Murray’s loving
arms, and, with a cry of anguish, I remembered that he was no
longer with me.
But my Lord gave me strength to finish the last preparations,
and when the house was in order and all was in readiness, I went
to my room, telling Lisa I could see no more visitors unless they
came with news of Murray.
I had just locked my door when Lisa knocked.
“ A Sheikh is downstairs, and he is the last person who was
with the master on the deck. Will you see him?” she said.
I went downstairs and found a venerable old man. His inter­
preter repeated to me the following account:
“ I was on the deck very late,” said the Sheikh, “ for it was very
hot down below and I could not sleep.
“ I noticed your husband many times, for he was walking up
and down very quickly all the night, and I thought he must soon
be very tired. But he went on and on, sometimes clasping his
hands and lifting them up as though he were praying to Allah.
I could not speak to him, for I know no English, but I wished to
do so, for although he had the form of a man he had the face of
an angel. I have never seen any human face so beautiful as his.”
The tears came to the kind eyes of the old man, and he raised
his hands above my head in a benediction, calling me, so the
interpreter told me afterwards, by a sacred name, which is rarely
given to a woman, and he doubted whether ever before it had
been given by a Mohammedan to a Christian woman.
The Sheikh continued: “ Then I went downstairs and left him
looking up to heaven as though he saw a vision.”
“ On what part of the coast were you,” I asked in a choking
voice, “ when last you saw him?”
“ We were just rounding the point into the Bay of Haifa, we
were almost home. If only I had stayed on deck this dreadful
accident might not have happened, for he turned to me once or
twice as though he needed help.”
“ Yes,” I said, “ he told his servant to stay with him, but he
was left alone, with no soul near to protect him.”
A spasm of pain went through me as I remembered how I had
264 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
cared for him in his slight indispositions, letting no harm come
near him if I could prevent it; and in his terrible hour of need
I had not been permitted to help him, my tender love was of no
avail.
But I would not let the thought enter, for the Voice ever orders
me not to allow even a shade of self-pity to possess my soul or
a complaint to pass my lips.
_ “ If you believe in Jesus Christ,” said the Voice to me many
times during these days, “ you must know that He was there,
and His protection is infinitely more valuable than yours.”
I thanked the kind Sheikh for his visit, and when he had gone
I returned to my own room.
There I threw myself on my knees, offering the deepest prayer
I knew how to utter, for my life seemed to be falling in ruins,
and with my knowledge of Jesus Christ I knew that it would be
a dire sin for me to give way to despair. I had seen Him on the
Altar of the Church of the Transfiguration, and, therefore, I
must believe and hope always.
While I knelt I heard the startling words: “ Your mate still
lives.”
As I had Murray and only Murray in my mind, I thought but
of him. He lived, the Voice said: and if this was true I must search
for him everywhere.
In the next few days I sent telegrams to all the important
ports where sailing vessels traded, as some of my visitors sug­
gested that he might have been picked up by one of these boats.
As Murray was easily described, his height alone serving to
identify him, seeing that he was six feet four inches, it would
not be difficult to trace him, if he had been landed somewhere.
I continued to send fresh recruits to the search party, and left
my doors open at night so that he could find his way into the
house, if he should wander back, out of his mind
Every belated carriage passing along the silent Colony streets
at night seemed to ride over my bared nerves; every sound of
prowling dogs or jackals sounded like his voice calling for help;
even the twigs rapping against my window imitated his slender
fingers tapping softly to wake me. I did not permit myself to
sleep soundly for weeks, but was ever on the alert. Again and
again a false alarm was brought saying he was found, and I was
once roused in the night by an imaginative Arab, declaring they
were bringing him to the door.
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL 265
Laurence’s illness, when he was in the grip of cancer and spasm
of the heart, had been a very hard trial, but his sickness and death
now seemed almost a blessed experience when compared with
this racking uncertainty. Laurence was tenderly cared for to the
last; but where was Murray, naked, fever-stricken, moneyless
—for he had left his purse with his clothes—where was he
wandering?
As the days passed I was ever more deeply perplexed, for I
realized more and more clearly that I felt Murray near me, I
plainly heard his joyous laugh, I was comforted by his tender
love. He seemed to be speaking to me and saying: “ Rosamond,
I am safe and blessedly happy.” Grace also appeared nearer to
me than she had ever been, the two seemed to be with me, even
as they had been in the flesh, in the happy time we spent together
under this roof; but now there was no hindering separation, no
bar to keep them apart, as there had been on earth.
“ What does it all mean?” I thought, and for the first time in
my fife I came near to reproaching the Voice for having misled
me. I knew, at last, that Murray was in Heaven, for he was near
me as a heavenly presence, and yet the Voice had said that he
still lived.
Then the words returned to me exactly as they had first been
spoken:
“ Your mate still lives.”
“ Do you believe Murray to be your mate?” said the Voice,
“ deeply as you loved him, do you think that he is the other self
destined to be yours from everlasting to everlasting? Do you
not think it possible that he may belong to another, and that a
being closer even than Murray may have been made, by God,
for you?”
I begged the Voice to let me stop thinking for a little while.
The way was so long, the detours so incomprehensible, the
suggestions so strange, that I longed for the homely, straight­
forward experiences of my sober-living neighbours.
The telegrams had all been answered, “ No such person known.”
The unsuccessful search party had returned. A cruel letter had
been sent me from Scotland, saying that I was the cause of my
husband’s death. The hot, monotonous days now followed each
other, wherein I could make no further effort, for there was
nothing more to be done. I knew that Murray had been drowned.
266 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
Many had asked me for an explanation of the tragedy and I
could only say:
“ He had a strong fever, and while it was upon him he was
exposed to a burning heat, day after day, in the dirty Arab
quarters without much sleep, and with only heavy, greasy food
to eat, such as the Arabs provide. It was more than he could bear,
and affected his brain. His first thought always, on waking, was
How can I best serve God this day ?’ and so his delirium took this
familiar form, he believed he must sacrifice his life to save Christ’s
humanity.”
This was the explanation I had given to myself and others.
One evening, as I sat in solitude, ever pondering afresh over
his tragical death, a sudden vision was shown to me.
I saw Murray received, as a royal prince, in heaven; crowds
gathered to greet him, and he rode in triumph on a white horse.
His face was illumined, his bearing regal and yet most meek.
Then he dismounted and went into a beautiful celestial home,
set in a heavenly garden, where, so I felt, he found a perfect
peace.
^ “ Do not think of the dreadful drowning scene,” said the Voice,
but remember the reward of those who have given their lives
in order to be faithful servants.
Conceding that it was delirium, and not God’s command,
which urged him to fling himself overboard as a sacrifice to save
others, what had brought on the delirium? Was it not his faith­
fulness to Mustafa, a filthy, drunken Arab; and his strenuous
effort to do his utmost with regard to the business connected
with Armageddon, and with helpless victims of Turkish tyranny,
who could be successfully defended by a reformed Mustafa, a
task given you by God, so you believe.
Therefore, continued the Voice, “ whether he gave his life
during the long, hot, feverish days, because he would not neglect
what he believed to be his duty; or whether he gave it, in one
supreme moment, when he thought, sanely or insanely, that God
had ordered it whatever explanation of the mystery is accepted,
Murray died because he refused to remain in Dalieh, his beloved
home, at your side, and instead went to Haifa to watch over a
filthy drunkard, repellent to every fibre of his refined nature,
aQd remained at his post, no matter what difficulties he encoun­
tered.
DALIEH-EL-CARM EL 267
“ He believed that the Battle of Armageddon was to be won,
the battle which will dethrone the city of harlots, and he has done
all that he could to be a steadfast soldier in that spiritual battle.
His zeal caused his death, and even though it may seem to cautious
ones, a zeal misplaced, yet God easily forgives too great a gener­
osity in sacrifice, and crowns those who have thus erred as Princes
in His realm. It is the cautiously self-preserving egoists who enter
the next world unheralded. Doubtless a saved Mustafa, a king
among Arab lawyers, could protect many helpless victims; so
Murray persevered, both because he felt he was fighting a moral
battle, hidden, mysterious; but also because he was undertaking
a plainly necessary effort for the poor and oppressed.
With the words a balm was poured into my wounded soul. If
Murray, and I added, dear Grace, are happy, it does not matter
whether I am lonely or not. And again I knew that God had
guided me aright, for seeing that this twain were to find each
other, very soon in Heaven, it was best for Murray to pass his
few short months on earth in the shelter of my home. It would
have been too miserable for him, had he wandered about the
world in solitude, after his family had discarded him because he
was Laurence’s faithful friend and mine.
Ah, God does all things well, if only we obey Him, even when
we cannot understand the reason of His commands. How could
He have told me, from the beginning, that Laurence would die
of cancer and Murray be drowned, and hence that I must tenderly
care for them until He took them. It was kinder to lead me on,
day by day, as He had done, thus giving me all the joy that could
be found in the society of these, my dearest friends, Laurence
and Murray, who will remain, to all eternity, my nearest of kin.
Even though I was meant to live alone for the rest of my life
and it seemed to me that this might well be the case—still, I had
been more deeply blessed than most women, and I must not
complain. The trial which most disturbed my mind was the
strangeness of the thing. My stately mate, for whom I had so
long prayed, had remained throughout, as the consummation
God reserved for me in this world or the next, and yet I had been
led to take the names of two men, in order that I might be able
to serve them unhindered. It was an unheard of experience, and
I love, not mysterious deflections, but directness of purpose.
As time wore on, however, my mind fitted itself more and
more into God’s plan. I thought, with an ever-increasing joy,
268 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
of Lau rence and Alice, and Murray and Grace, relieved of all
earthly care, and as for me and my small predilections, they did
not matter, and I did not wish my heavenly Guides to pay any
attention to them. I was there to serve, so the only useful question
to be asked was, “ How can I serve best?” and even my unimagi­
native common sense saw that the days which remained to
Laurence and Murray, before they reaped their fruition in
Heaven, had been spent more happily, perhaps, in my company,
than they could have been spent elsewhere.
A TESTIN G TRIAL
A f e w weeks after Murray’s death Mustafa reeled into my house,
drunk. He had come a few days after Murray had been taken
from me, had flung himself on his knees before me and in a
passion of grief, which seemed to be genuine, he had begged my
forgwene ^ drunkj your husband would not have gone to
Beyrouth, and he would be alive now. I am the cause of his death
I have killed the best man on earth,” said Mustafa, with the tea
running down his cheeks. “ If you will forgive me, I solemnly
promise never to touch liquor again. , . u i

And now only four short weeks had passed, and he stood before
me leering and lurching idiotically. His clothes were filthy,
S s ’face like a coarse mask, his small, bleared eyes almost hidden
by bloated flesh. He was an utterly disgusting object, offending
every sense, and as he lurched leeringly towards me, I realized
that unless I could hold him in check, he might become a danger,
m in my body seemed to revolt, standing
still during a breath, and then racing madly on in a ternb e
reYet°n

My faith almost failed, for if there was a God, how could He P
mit Murray to be killed for such a creature as this. A.n angel h
been taken and a brute remained, unchanged, unhelped, by t
sacrifice. My life had been robbed of its treasure for nothing.
And stiff the drunkard leered and lurched, grinning senseless y
and repeating his expressions of remorse with an insincen y
which made them meaningless. It seemed intolerable.
But the stern Voice would not let me give way. Are you
being more offensively treated than was your crucified Lor .
it said “ And if He, the powerful Saviour of all men, could forgive,
may not you, seeking feebly to be the saviour of one man, also
forgive?”
270 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
The Scene of the Crucifixion rose before me, with all its horrors
clearly present to my inner vision, and I bent my head in shame.
What right had I to be sorry for myself, when my King had
taught me how infinitely patient a forgiving Spirit may be. He,
million-fold greater than I, had suffered million-fold more; and
here was I in angry revolt, ready to doubt the existence of my
God.
I hid my face in my hands, and with remorseful tears I said to
the Voice, “ Forgive me and intercede for me, so that I may have
the strength to take up my cross.”
Mustafa looked on, but he was too bestially stupid, for the
moment, to comprehend anything. So I could only pray for him.
For three long, monotonous years I persevered. The fever
sapped my strength, and sometimes I was scarcely able to work
on my book, The Mediators, which was the one interest my soli­
tary life now held. I could not look beyond the day, for if I did
my courage began to fail. So I laboured on, hour by hour, clinging
to my Saviour for the present strength which I needed. Mustafa
remained sober, at times, for several weeks; at one period he
did not drink for two or three months. He was at the house almost
every day, and I sacrificed many precious hours. But in the end
he always fell; his nature seemed too little genuine to make a
sincere effort. He talked, endlessly, and did very little, and this
is a character which tries me to the utmost. But I listened and
listened yet again to the protestations which had so small a value,
until the sound of his voice seemed to sicken me, and the sight of
his red tarboosh appearing above a walled street leading to our
house turned me cold with dread.
The acme was reached when a deputation was sent to me,
saying that his constant presence at the house was creating
gossip, exciting comment.
I turned on the man chosen to be speaker with a scathing
scorn.
“ I have been married to Laurence Oliphant, and to Murray,
do you think it likely, then, that Mustafa, a drunken Arab, would
appeal to me as a lover?”
“ You are right,” he said, “ it is ridiculous, and I apologize.”
“ I am trying to save a poor sinner from perdition,” I said,
“ and it is the hardest task I have ever undertaken. This is the
whole truth.”
A TESTIN G TRIAL 271
“ We believe you,” said the deputation, and retired.
Mustafa was constantly pretending that he was trymg to push
forward the business connected with Armageddon, in order to
get possession, and as constantly demanding mon% for ï^
fervices. When I refused, he said, “ Very well, if you wülnotpay
for me to go to Beyrouth, Jenin, etc., it is your own fault if matters
remain at a standstill. . . .
Again and again he went to Beyrouth and Jenin on one pretext
or another, to get the land out of the grip of the Government or
of the fellaheen, or to carry out some formality of the ^ k n o w
as making the mafrous, necessary to unite the scattered portions
of land in one piece. He constantly drained dm ° f moneyon these
pretexts, and invariably got drunk and did ^
being forthcoming, and the land ever remaining t“ pro^ ct^ ;
Between the Turks, the fellaheen, and Mustafa, it was a devil s
^ r e was only a bridle-path to the land in those days (now it
is in the angle of two railways) and no English was spoken at
Jenin, only Turkish and Arabic, hence I could no ^reach the
place, and had I been able to do so, I should have been hke a
person quite illiterate, unable to read or write and deaf ” ^ du'jr
into the bargain, as I could neither understand nor speak Turkish
or Arabic, and would have been at the mercy of a group ot liars,
headed by Mustafa himself, my own agent.
I watched over him constantly, and over and over agarn sta ed
him, sober, on his way, only to see him return, a
with nothing accomplished. When he had been sober for some
time I tried Sresh, but always with the same result. He was always
falling and never resisting temptation, and as time wore on
dangers became more and more evident, dangers to be desenb
presently.
TH E DIVID IN G LIN E
T h e long, hot summer, the third I had passed on the plain, was
nearing its end. My most frequent visitor, next to Mustafa, during
these monotonous months was Frau F., and I was grateful to
have an intelligent companion, interested in some of the subjects
which filled my mind.
We had many friendly discussions, and I was struck by the
fact that her education and mine had been diametrically opposite.
Her father thought it best not to laugh, but always to be solemnly
in earnest, whereas in my home anything savouring of heaviness
of spirit had been reproved. We were taught that we were sinning
when we were not gay, cheering those with whom we came in
contact, while in her home a jolly mirth had been sternly sup­
pressed. r
One day we were discussing whether the severe condemna­
tion of all beauty, taught in those days in the Colony, was right.
“ You have some lace on the cover of your divan,” I said,
“ which costs about two piastres the ell. Would you consider it
sinful if you put on lace which costs three piastres or four piastres?
If you allow any decoration at all, how are you to decide at what
point it becomes sinful? Is the line to be drawn between two
piastres and three piastres or between three piastres and four
piastres the ell? There is, of course, the common-sense limitation
which dictates that one must not go beyond one’s income; but
let us say that the income is ample, and permits decoration, at
what point are you going to say, ‘God permits this ugly lace or
fringe, but He does not approve of this pretty lace or fringe?’
Does God like ugly things best? Do His flowers, and His birds,
and His butterflies, and His glorious sunsets, suggest that He
does? My young and pretty cook has just taken three days to
decide between two hats, both about as ugly as they could be,
one having a coarse red rose stuck on it, in the wrong place, and
the other a yellow one. Is God pleased, because, after spending
much time, she has donned a very ugly hat, which becomes her
not at all?”
Frau F. looked puzzled.
“ Where, then, do you draw the line?” she asked.
TH E DIVID IN G LIN E 273
“ One must, of course, live within one’s means, but when this
precaution has been observed, there seems to be only one infallible
test by which one may decide when sumptuousness becomes a
SU
1«I am curious to know what you think this decisive test is,
said Frau F., “ for in this Temple Colony we have thought ah
SU“ IP
ttse0emseto me/’ ^suggested, “ that when the rich owner of
the lace gratefully thanking God, uses it solely to give work to
the L i e » end to give pleasure to the onlookers; ¿ » h e r e
God clearly commands it, shares it with these neighbours she,
unconscious of self, is behaving righteously, no matter how beauti­
ful and costly the lace may be, which someone has earned a w
paid living by making. When the owner of the lace, thanking
God not at all, uses it solely for vanity’s sake, she, conscious
only of self, is behaving unrighteously, no matter how ug y
cheap the lace may be.” „ ., P -n
“ That is an entirely new point of view to me said Frau F.
“ Do you think, then, that a woman may be magnificently dressed
in silks and jewels, and still be an unworldly, a rehgious woman.j
“ May I answer your question by asking anoth .
“ Do you think that God can make precious stones andfurmsh
silk-making materials, mid still be God? Doesthe fiict that 3od
snends the greater part of His creative Power in the manufacture
of beauty make Him less divine? This is the
the Creator and ourselves, is it not? He lavishes a 1 thing
bless us, whereas we hoard His gifts instead of yleldmS ^ ^ ’
unreservedly, at His bidding, to others. If we cannot be beaut
without being vain, then it is best for us to dress in unadorned
black, always; but we ought to be humbly aware tdat w^
be thus clad, not because we are saints, but because wearejnners.
“ It seems to me, then, that the effort to be mack y y
beautiful woman and handsome man is a simp y e e_ ’
not having created themselves, it is their duty to thank the Create
and not to praise self, for when self is foolishly praised the gre
part of the charm is lost.” , ,,,
“ I must think it over,” said Frau F., “ but I warn you, I shall be
hard to convert, for with my mother’s milk I drank m a fear o
everything that the world considers gay and calls beautii .
Whenever I am tempted to be jolly, which is not often, a ways
feel that I am not being religious.”
HOME-COMING
M y relatives in America had long been begging me to come home,
at any rate for a visit, and I felt when I had spent three long years
in Haifa, after Murray’s death, that God permitted me to go
for a time.
I took Lisa with me and left Herbert in charge, as she seemed
in need of a change, and he was quite willing to be left at Haifa
until our return.
I journeyed to New Harmony, U.S.A., reaching there one
evening when all the gay little town—such a contrast to the almost
sadly solemn Colony I had left—was on its way to the theatre,
where an exceptionally good company was playing. I did not
wish to keep Julian and his family at home, so I went with them,
and my heart was cheered by the greetings from every part of the
house.
“ Welcome, welcome, Miss Rose,” sounded from all sides, and
I realized that after all my wanderings, I had come back to find
the love of my old friends undiminished by my absence.
My dear brother Julian, seeing that I was very tired, sustained
me with his strong arm in the old familiar way; and my heart
overflowed with gratitude, to find that I was not quite alone in
the world, as I had sometimes seemed to be.
The baby was in bed when I reached the village, but the next
morning I saw Grace’s child, a little blonde beauty, who had been
named after her mother, and a most strenuous and clever little
person she turned out to be.
ABDUL HAMID’S NECKLACE
A w e e k or two before I left New Harmony, I was surprised to
receive a letter from Marseilles saying that a young Arab I had
known, whose father had rendered me some “ ^ “ ^ T h i
Haifa was on his way to visit me, uninvited, in America,
penniless Arab boy proved to be a considerable charge, especially
as I had very little money with which to keep him, and had he
not started until he had asked me if I could receive him I should
have told him not to come. But he followed his letter in a day or
t o , without a penny in his pocket, and I

I came in contact through this young man ,
Finally I was obliged to pawn a diamond neckla ^ ^ Y

condition of misery. M , good brother Julian «deemed the
necklace, watch, and ring, so I did not lose them. The Arab lad,
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
276
however, resisted temptation, improved much, and became
finally a useful individual in a small sphere.
While I was negotiating for the loan, a refined-looking lady
stepped up to the counter, and offered a handsome gold bracelet;
she received one pound on it (five dollars). As she left the room,
I caught the despairing look in her face, a look which remained
with me for many days.
When I had done what I could for the shiftless Arabs in New
York, I resumed my solitary way to Syria.
As I passed Gibraltar the Voice said to m e:
“ The Rock of Gibraltar symbolizes the work which awaits
you in Palestine.” No explanation was given, and I often pondered
over this mysterious prophecy, wondering what it meant. I found
afterwards that it was a merciful message, as it gave me the
courage to persevere in a very long and very difficult task. When
I questioned whether, in truth, I had been guided aright in
undertaking it, the above sentence ever recurred to me, in order
to persuade me that the work was ordained by God, for it had
been prophetically foreshadowed.
When I arrived in Haifa, my house was closed, and I had no
servant. But kind neighbours helped me, and my home was soon
in order. After some weeks of lonely hard work, I found an
intelligent girl, above the servant class, who served me in a very
capable manner for several years, until she took a place as teacher
in a school.
May I say here that the Temple Colony in which I lived,
became more and more helpful to me as time went on. I was very
grateful for this kindness in my lonely life. Throughout, there
was an affectionate good will between us, before, during, and
after the war, though they were Germans; and I was able to be
of some service to them, I am thankful to say.
A WORLD-COURT AND PALESTIN E
During the long and solitary days which followed, in the last
decade of eighteen hundred, an idea which had been floating
through my mind took a more definite shape, as I pondered
alZ th o M h h
I°lSd suffered so cruelly in the Holy Land, I grew to
love it with a fervent love, and I realized more and more deeply
how great a disgrace it is to Christendom that the Birthplace of
our Lord should be one of the most disorganized places on the
&He^ures'for us law and order, and we in return penult
chaos to continue in His Land. For may we not accept that He
not only the Savour of souls, but the Captain of Ind^ « y^ eem g
that the Christian countries are¡organized countries
Christian lands are, as a rule, disorganized lands.. We Christ
build the majority of the railways, the ports, the roads, the hos
pitals.the'schoolj; we thinkof the greater P » ^
Lid teach their uses; we are, in the m a m 7 S o f thi

experience goes, one can draw a hne between the orde
Christian part of an Oriental town and the disorder of the non-
ChIf,SttheiTthis is our Christian inheritance, is it not a shame
to us that Palestine is still chaotically misgoverned.
Urged by these thoughts, I sought a solution, my
find f better way being strengthened by some swift Fopheti
visions which were flashed before my spiritual eyes, visions of
a blood-red chaos, the very antithesis of law and order i ^ d w
these visions came a growing sense of apprehension S
some great calamity, some colossal Armageddon, J « e threa

prayed for light; and, losing no time, <

not by their limited human vision, but by God
Wisdom. Only if Christianity triumphed, so I saw, throug
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
278
Church and the State in all Christian lands, could the impending
horror be avoided.
This, concisely put, was the thought which developed ever
more clearly in my mind; and if the reader will permit me to
anticipate, finally took the following practical shape, in the years
ranging from 1895 to 1919. I sent abroad during these years,
commencing in November 1895, letters and pamphlets, and
received some answers from eminent men; but, alas, my small
influence could not move the earth to see the danger as I
saw it.
I wrote a pamphlet submitted to a number of learned men.
In this pamphlet the Constitution of the League of Nations which
was suggested resembled the one which later was adopted, but
with certain exceptions:
In answer to prayer, it came to me that the countries which had
been so ill-governed as to be a danger to the Commonwealth,
and the countries to which various irreconcilable claims were
advanced, should be turned into International Republics, thereby
saving much time and strife. For to inspire countries which had
not proved themselves to be capable of self-government with the
idea of self-determination seemed to be an unsettling course of
action. In short, any country which was a menace to the peace
of the world, should be internationally controlled.
In addition to this, I suggested in a pamphlet called The
Silence of the Peoples: A. Danger, that an Auxiliary Assembly
should be formed, meeting at the same time and place as the
League of Nations, whose duties would be as follows.
TH E A U X ILIA RY ASSEM BLY
In order to obtain the opinion of the masses in each country
belonging to the World-Court, the suggestion was that a question
which concerned these masses should be formulated and published
in a numbered series of possible courses of action, by the Delegates
in the Auxiliary Assembly, in the four leading newspapers, let
us say, of the countries involved; and the Delegates in the
Auxiliary Assembly from these countries would be empowered
to receive and to report to the League of Nations the majority
votes of any Society or Trade Union of a given size and import­
ance, votes confined, within a time-limit, to simple acceptance
or rejection without comment of one or more of the numbere
series of actions published. In this wise a consensus of opinion
could be quickly obtained, as a guide for the World-Court
without making the hearing of the World-Voice too complicated
or unwieldy, for each Society would cable its officially registered
number, the size of the Society, and the majority voting for a
given course, by quoting its number in the series of possible
actions published by the Delegates in the Auxiliary Assembly.
To give an example: .
The Delegates in the Auxiliary Assembly cable to their respec­
tive nations that war is threatened and tabulate, let us say, five
possible courses of action. A Society internationally enrolled
would cable back as follows:
S o c i e t y ...............................N °' 500
Membership 1 >°°°
Votes given . . . . 800
For Course No. 4.
Thus, by instituting simple and easily worked machinery,
any citizens energetic enough to form themselves into large and
responsible upper, middle-class, and working men’s Societies,
could telegraph or cable without delay to the Auxiliary Assembly
of the League concise reports from each Society, whether
composed of men or women, on any question published by t e
Auxiliary Assembly in the leading newspapers of the country
concerned, and so keep intimately in touch with an Internationa
2 8 o M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PALESTIN E
League, when it was sitting, or with the Council of the League
in the interim, in order to influence all decisions, closely con­
cerning the Peoples. All the Societies of importance belonging
to the League of Nations Union, or National Citizens’ Union, or
Rotary Clubs, or Women’s Clubs, or Brotherhoods, could thus
come in active touch with the League, through the simplest
possible organization.
The duties of the Delegates of this Auxiliary Assembly would
be, in the main, to formulate for publication, in a numbered
series, the details of the question or questions under consideration
in so clear a form that concise answers could be given, by the
League of Nation’s Societies to the Auxiliary Assembly, which
could present these answers in tabulated lists to the League of
Nations, the Delegates of the Auxiliary Assembly adding such
condensed reports and comments as these Delegates elected
to make.
In this wise no well-organized nation could be rushed into
war or forced to undertake any other responsibilities without
a hearing. No country would be obliged to send Delegates to
this Auxiliary Assembly, but if it neglected to do so—and no
great nation would be thus supine—it would suffer the conse­
quences, as the Voice of its people would not be clearly, concisely,
and promptly heard by the League of Nations.1
I have seen many men and women of all nations pass through
Palestine in the years I have lived there, loving it as they love no
other place on earth. Many hundreds of noble pilgrims prove
their devotion each year, coming here from distant countries,
tramping many miles on foot, and suffering, without complaint,
every hardship on the way. The sight ever renews my hope that
the world still ardently loves Him and that Palestine has a unique
place in the world. Hence my great desire had been, in these days
before the war, that the Prophecy which has sounded down the
ages might be fulfilled, not through war, but through the united
effort of Christendom, irresistible in its power.
“ At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the
Lord, and all the nations shall be gathered unto it”
(Jer. iii. 17).
1 I have recently published a pamphlet suggesting in greater detail the machinery
to be used, a pamphlet called The Silence of the Peoples: A. Danger, and have sent a
number of copies to the League of Nations.
TH E A U X ILIA RY ASSEM BLY 281
It seems a fitting thing that Palestine, beloved of all Nations,
should lead the way as an International Republic, a plan warmly
desired by the Arabs, so I found, a Republic stretching from the
southern boundary of Palestine to Mount Taurus; but alas, we
are as yet far from reaching the Unity which would make feasible
such a Scheme, so I realize more and more plainly.
Yet shall it always remain impossible? I trust not, for the
eventual possibility of establishing a harmonious Holy Land
was faintly foreshadowed during one short hour, in a meeting
to be described presently.
The objection is sometimes raised that Palestine is a poor
country, and that its Government is cramped, necessarily, as a
benefactor of the people.
Nevertheless, its crops are varied, the land, when well-tilled,
is fertile, and it is affirmed that in the Dead Sea alone is a mine of
unexplored wealth, which, were its chemical and mineral deposits
used for the Commonwealth, as Nature’s deposits^ should be,
instead of being exploited enormously to enrich individuals, these
resources alone would furnish a large income for public wor s,
so I understand.
M USTAFA
I w as soon reminded of the fact that I had been led to leave
my beloved home and to return to Palestine in order to continue
the Battle of Armageddon, the mysterious spiritual battle which
I scarcely understood. For Mustafa appeared a day or two after
my arrival, and the long effort to save him recommenced,
although he seemed to have become now a hopeless drunkard.
I resumed the task, one of the most difficult with which a
Christian is burdened, namely the task of continuing a long and
arduous labour, without being able to fathom the reason why one
is led to persevere in what seems to be an almost meaningless
effort. This blind obedience appeared to be more and more
senseless as time went on and absolutely no result was forth­
coming. Nevertheless I knew, because of a still small Voice,
scarcely to be heard at times, I knew that I must not yield to the
weary disgust which sometimes threatened to overwhelm me.
There was in the little Colony of Haifa at that time no relaxation,
no superior music, no lectures, no relief of any kind in my
environment, but only the horribly monotonous work of caring
for this drunkard, growing worse and more imbecile, in sharp
contrast to the interesting society of Laurence and Murray,
banishing, in the past, all sense of solitude.
Mustafa, constantly going and coming to and from Jenin, had
all the Turkish papers relative to the property in his possession,
and it still remained true that he knew the Turkish law, which
I certainly did not; knew the necessary languages, Turkish and
Arabic, which I did not; could get to Jenin on horseback, which
I could not, and come in touch with the officials when he was there,
which, as I was speechless, so far as Arabic and Turkish are
concerned, I would have been unable to do.
Above all, he was an irresponsible drunkard, having no sort of
sequence in his business affairs. There was endless procrastination
concerning certain formalities and the land was never delivered
to me administratively. In short, everything was left at loose
ends, and he was quite capable, had I crossed or resisted him in
any way, of secretly destroying all my papers, for at the least hint
of bringing him to reason he became a dangerous madman.
MUSTAFA 285
The mere suggestion of putting someone in his place sent
him into dangerously mad rages, and had I done so my h e
might have been the price I would have had to pay. Absin
combined with arrack (native whisky), which he now drank
constantly and copiously, are most dangerous incentives to crime
There was only one way of gaining relief: I could have put him 1
prison, a prison not fit for a dog. I had once ooked down into
this dungeon for five minutes, and the horrible stench sickened
me, for there was no sanitation of any kind; it was like a beast
I could not have slept quietly in my own clean bed, had I
condemned anyone to five in this horrible place, as it was m those
days, now reformed, happily. So I continued to suffer a constan
and prolonged danger which was exceedingly nerve-racking.
Why did I not leave, why not go back to the home where
was beloved and protected? I continued to ask myself this
question, but again and again an almost inaudible and yet thun­
dering Voice said, “ Persevere.” A soldier has his companions
in danger and this companionship must be a solace, but 1 ha
no one—I was alone, unprotected, helpless, enduring daily the
presence of this man, both dangerous and disgusting, who had
possessed a master mind, in his own sphere, but who was becom
ing more and more of a beast as time went on.
h I only knew that I must obey my Spirit guidance; all the rest
was obscure, incomprehensible, and, at times, almost ma e g
in the daily tension to which I was being subjected. If this was
the task inherent in the Battle of Armageddon, this constant
contact with revolting filth, it was not an easy one.
But I had given my promise in that long-ago time, in ew
York, when I sat watching, at four o’clock in the morning, t e
few passers-by to be seen at such an hour. I then gave my wor
that I would work for Purity, work for the sake of women-victims
enslaved by incontinent desire, work so that children, thoug
they are called legitimate, may not be born through an uncon­
trolled appetite calling itself love. , , r
How was I to judge in what way God required the keeping
such promises? How was I to measure the radiations ot the
unseen, uncounted vibrations of ceaseless effort, silently sent
out during these difficult hours, straining all my moral and ment
resources to the utmost? That such vibrations are effective I have
had proof more than once. To give an example: I was in a
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
284
merchant ship lying in harbour on Christmas Eve. I was the only
passenger on board. At dinner champagne was freely served,
which I refused. All the officers at the table had arranged to go
on shore after dinner, and I felt that a loose lack of control
weakened them. I prayed for them earnestly during the evening.
At eleven o’clock they all returned to the ship, and the captain
and chief engineer said to m e: “ We meant to make a night of it,
but in some mysterious way your influence drew us back to the
boat.” “ It was a higher Influence than any it is possible for me
to exert, that won you to return,” I said. Two years later I sailed
on the same boat, and these officers reminded me, with gratitude,
of this incident.
I said to the engineer, who was a student, “ If even material
sounds may be radiated through the air accurately and univer­
sally to millions of attentive listeners, who can tell what our
souls, God-moved, can accomplish by reaching out to those who
are ready to receive the message?”
Armageddon, the fight for Purity, ensuring the fall of Babylon
the harlot, must be won before the world can be made a clean and
wholesome place to live in, for prostitution, even in thought,
apart from sinful deed, is a pest polluting that accurate carrier,
the receptive air; hence, there is an immense work to be done,
and it is not for us to pick and choose, how and when and where,
and through what training it is to be accomplished; nor to faint,
and fail when our own small task therein seems to be a puzzling,
because an impotently mysterious one. For we must ever realize
that no matter how secluded we may seem to be, we live in a
wide world where, unchecked, vastly circling vibrations may be
carried from soul to receptive soul, though these be separated
by great stretches of force-filled spaces, the accurately swift
ether and air spaces, which are sufficiently extended to embrace
all our widest needs.
Magnificent as may become this wide influence at last, yet we
must ever remember that the Central Impetus is secured not only
through a life filled with mystical visions, beautiful as they
may be, but through the steady and persevering performance of
one’s daily duties, often commonplace and tedious duties.
When these are shirked, no accurate and lasting vibrations are
sent out, for idly inert ideals are inoperative. We live in a strictly
law-governed world of cause and effect, and a self-centred and
lazy egoism has no causal value, it moves nowhere and accom-
M USTAFA 285
pUshes nothing which is soUdly, because eternally, useful. Force
cannot be fooled into being forcefhl by vagaries. The most
materiaUstic natures are now ceasing to be materially sense-
bound, for aU know that Ups need not speak close to one ear
in order to be heard, but that messages may sweep in a great
circle of radio-activity touching receptive senses, everywhere;
hence the great need is not physical proximity in order to do
widespread moral work, but an utterance coming from a great
soul, great because having lost all confidence in its own small
human powers, it humbly cUngs close to the all-comprehending
Maker of heaven and earth; and hence is able, through His
Spirit-ether, to reach kindred souls, no matter where they are
found, at the other end of the world, it may be. , .
So I laboured on with poor, drunken Mustafa bearing
almost unbearable filth as best I could, day after day, until the
days stretched into years, trusting that my effort was of use
somewhere, somehow, for I knew, at any rate, that Uwas an effort
so difficult that it strained me almost to the breaking p ,
times; and hence if the vibrations of influence r a y be measured
by the vibrations of the effort made, I trusted that I might be of
some wider service than the one to which I was chamed m caring
for this mad drunkard. It seemed that I must touch this depth
in order to measure a corresponding height.
For, confronted daily by this bestial man’ '^ T w h t l e
year-long monotony of disgusting toil, against which y
nature revolted, I was led to pray and ev e r to co n t m u e to py
that the Sir Galahads and their answering brides sh° ^ kn° ’
more and more, the virile and the exquisitely recjtive tw n
purities which, when attuned by Heaven, ma7, meciion
Only by parents answering one another with the precision
distinguishing a perfect dual harmony, may God s fair childre
be born; and thus only may it be lastingly ensured that no unhappy
sot shall be bred to live a tormented and tormenting existe .
Only by cleansing the source of fife may the stream of life run
^C aii one picture the contrast between perfectly poised angels
blessing all space, and this uncertainly staggering d™ h ar /
S d yet we, God’s humanity, are asked to rise from this depth
to reach that height, in order to meet Him, safely balanced,
It behoves us, then, having so long a journey before us, not
286 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
to fail and faint by the way. This fact I impressed on my weary
brain again and again, but again and again did the task have to
be freshly begun, wresting an infinite variety from a long, long
continuance of sickening monotony, and this is one of the
greatest tasks imposed upon us while on this slow earth. We are
asked never to forget the glad, pure, ever-changing joys of
Heaven, while working continually amidst bestiality, and this
is not easily accomplished, as many a struggler knows.
For three long years after my return to Haifa I continued to
labour in vain, spending time and money and accomplishing
nothing whatsoever. Again and again Mustafa went to Jenin to
redeem my property by having it delivered to me administratively,
according to the Contract between myselfand the Turkish Govern­
ment, and again and again he returned home drunk. Yet I felt
obliged to persevere, for this was the object for which I had been
sent to Palestine. One task only remained to me, the task of
getting practical, usable possession of Armageddon ; the reason
was obscure, but the injunction not to become inert clearly
persisted, and to obey a quite obscure injunction, which
heavily, monotonously, burdens one in each day of one s
life for years, is not an easy task. A very strong faith is
required. ,
As time went on, it became more and more clear to me that
this fallen Mustafa was in league with the corrupt Turkish
Government, and instead of seeking to put me in possession of
the land, rightfully mine, he was joining the treacherous Turks
in cheating me. Yet there was no help I could invoke, as all
means had been tried and had failed, in order to secure this
outward sign of an inward, a hidden triumph. Neither the Em­
bassy, the Consul-General, the Consul, at Haifa, nor anyone
else, seemed able to manage the Turks.
The moment Mustafa began to drink absinthe his one absorbing
desire seemed to be to kill me, hoping, I suppose, that if I could
be put out of the way, he would permanently get the land. He
threatened my life several times before witnesses, and prowled
about the house both day and night. On more than one occasion
the Colony Guard was obliged to take him in charge.
The Vice-Consul, under whose care I was, expostulated with
me, and said the Consul-General had written from Beyrouth,
MUSTAFA 287
saying that he would himself come to put Mustafa in prison, for
it was believed everywhere that he might kill me, seeing that
it had become a mad, a fixed desire with this absinthe drunkard.
To imprison him was the only solution offered, no other way
seeming to be open, so I was advised by the various officials
I had consulted.
One Sunday afternoon Mustafa had made a terrible scene in
my home, yelling like a maniac, so that the passers-by ran in to
offer assistance. The Vice-Consul came in the evening, and
begged me to give him permission to put Mustafa under lock
and key.
“ It is hot weather,” he said, “ and your doors and windows
are all open; you cannot shut yourself in during this stifling
heat. You are, therefore, in a dangerously exposed position.
At any moment he could shoot you when you are sitting on the
veranda or at an open window, and he is constantly threatening
to kill you.”
I was well aware that the Consul spoke the truth, for my nerves
had been on the rack for months, fearing a sudden attack from
Mustafa. He was growing more and more brutal and losing any
good qualities he may have possessed. He was now too far gone
to listen to reason, or to remember the reverent affection which,
I think, he had for me in the beginning. Drink, once it wholly
possesses a man, destroys all traces of his true self, and the true
self of Mustafa had been a fine one. I felt that I was no longer
dealing with my old friend, but with a stranger, with an obsessing
demon, who had taken possession of that friend. Mustafa was no
longer Mustafa, but had become a murderous devil. All his
former desire to serve his kind, in the way he could best serve,
namely by legally protecting the many victims of Turkish
tyranny, this altruism was quite paralysed. It was in order to do
this very necessary work that we had perseveringly served him;
but now that task had become impossible, for the devil drink, a
devil which, for the sake of weakly tempted ones, the world
would do well to chain, had killed in him all his former
generous desire to serve his fellow-creatures. Why, then, should
I persevere?
I asked the Consul to give me the night for reflection. I was
shaken by the mad and dangerous scene through which I had
passed, and felt that I was not in a condition to come to a decision.
288 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
I went to sleep from exhaustion, and in the middle of the night
I was wakened by the words:
“ Vengeance is Mine.”
I knew, then, that I was not to have Mustafa put in prison.
The Consul thought me an exceedingly foolish woman, and
said that I was putting him in a difficult position, as he would be
blamed were a fatal accident to befall me.
But I could not disobey the prophetic Voice, so I said to him
that I would state in writing, if he chose, that he, the Consul,
had done his utmost, and that if I was killed it was my own fault.
A Turkish official also came to beg me to imprison Mustafa.
But I said to him:
“ The God of my religion promises that He will protect me,
and says that I must not imprison him, no matter how dangerous
he becomes.”
Two weeks later I woke in the night and heard the words,
“ It is done” ; and immediately I felt a great sense of relief, a
huge load seemed to have dropped from my burdened soul.
The next morning the Turkish official rushed into the drawing­
room without waiting to be announced, and said excitedly:
“ The God of your religion has kept His promise, for sixteen
members of Mustafa’s family are in prison; not only has Mustafa
himself been shut up, but all his sons, nephews, and cousins.
He, aided by the others, killed last night in a drinking-shop
brawl, wherein he was mixed, a very old man belonging to a
well-known family here, and this influential family has demanded
that they shall all be put in prison, as all of them were implicated
in the murder.”
A friend came to me a few weeks later and said he thought
Mustafa, who had heard of my refusal to have him put in prison,
would now be ready to hand to me, willingly, all the papers in
his possession, and joyfully I realized that, at last I was freed from
the constant terror of assassination, which was imminent the
moment I crossed him in any way. My release had come, so I
most gratefully realized, through no self-defence, which would
have filled me with a constant concern for Mustafa in that horrible
prison, but I was delivered from evil through a saving inter­
position, leaving me filled with compassion for Mustafa and his
family and the aged man who had been murdered, it is true, but
permitting me to rejoice in the fact that I was blameless. I had
MUSTAFA 289
deprived no man of his liberty, even when that liberty had turned
into a murderous licence. I further realized that I had been
delivered not of an imaginary, but of a very real danger, for
Mustafa had murdered a helpless victim mixed in this drunken
brawl, and that victim might have been myself, in my unguarded
home.
I was sorry for the helpless women of the family and had helped
them in their distress, an aid which further touched Mustafa’s
heart, so I learned.
Had I put Mustafa in prison, he, being a revengeful man, would
never have given me the papers, short of violently wrenching
them from him, nor would he have given to his successor the
necessary information and instructions; also, when he was freed
from prison his mad desire to kill me would have been intensified.
As it was, when he was released some years later, the first
act of this broken man was to beseech me for a pardoning mercy.
He died, a repentant sinner, shortly afterwards.
My new lawyer went without delay, as soon as he obtained the
necessary coaching and the papers, to Jenin to put Armageddon
in order.
I had laboured and waited many long years to reach this point,
and every Consul and every business man I had consulted said
that the delivery never would be practically accomplished, because
it was impossible to take the property from the grip of murderous
Mustafa. He had everything on his side, the papers in his posses­
sion, and an unscrupulous influence with the corrupt Turkish
Government ever refusing to fulfil its duties. They all declared
I was helpless, under so tyrannical a master as the Turkish
Government in connivance with treacherous Mustafa, who had
so much power in his hands, while I had so little.
“ I would not give you twenty Napoleons for this valuable
land,” said my Consul.
Even at this stage of progress when Mustafa was no longer a
danger, it was still thought that I was not freed; for besides
Mustafa, I had two other enemies. A bigoted Mohammedan
Pasha, who was Dictator in that part of the world; and the head
Sheikh of the village. These two influential persons were against
me. The Pasha, especially, had an almost unlimited power, and
he hated Christians, so it was said.
When my new lawyer arrived at Jenin, he found that the Pasha
had been temporarily exiled, for some political offence, and the
T
M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
Sheikh was in prison for a theft; so my three powerful enemies
were swept out of the way not by my hand, but by the hand of
Providence.
When, at last, all the imposing-looking deeds of Armageddon
came safely into my hands made out in perfect order, I believed
that my troubles were at an end, and my hopes rose high. But
I soon found that the grip of Governments was, if not as physically
dangerous, yet was so enslaving as to shackle me during the many
long and difficult years which followed.
I should have been amazed, had anyone told me that in the
year 1926-7, eight years after the British Government of Palestine
had been in power, that I would not have made one inch of
progress, so far as my practically usable ownership of Armaged­
don is concerned, the final hindrance raised being prescription.
So long as the Turks were in power endless trouble was my
portion. The land was mousha, namely was in a quantity of
small pieces, numbered and put in a bag once in two years. When
one drew one’s numbers one discovered that the land was
peripatetic, not pinned to the earth as it were, for the piece which
had been in the south-east corner was now located, it may be,
in the north-west corner of the village properties, and this con­
stant shifting of one’s pieces of land, a system which only a Turk
could invent, prevented all consecutive cultivation of one’s
fields. This system, called mousha, has now been changed, but
it was in full force, at that time, and I could not gather my
scattered pieces of land into one, or even into four large tracts,
without the consent of the other landowners, a consent which
these fellaheen were never willing to give.
In addition, when I sought to engage an engineer to give me
an exact measurement of these scattered bits of land, the fellaheen
were so fierce that he refused to proceed, and even had he been
allowed to go on with the measurement, the land was divided into
faddans, and a faddatt is determined by guessing how much a
man and a pair of oxen can plough in a year, so I was informed,
whether truthfully or not I cannot say, for it was exceedingly
difficult to get any correct information about anything; in any
event, I could not get my peripatetic land measured. My head
swam with the hopeless effort of bringing some sort of order
out of this confusion, balking me at every step.
Throughout, the Turkish Government only increased the
M USTAFA 291
difficulties which enmeshed me, and did nothing whatever to
free me from them, unless promises and contracts never fulfilled
may be called a help.
For I next discovered that I had no control of the land whatever,
as the renters I tried to put on it, among them the British Vice-
Consul, were incontinently chased off, and no European would
buy this mousba land. For one year I managed to rent it, at last,
to the fellaheen themselves, and spent the greater part of the
rent in keeping them in order.
Then at last came the joyful news that we were freed from
the Turks. General Allenby had conquered Palestine, and a just
British Government was being installed. All hearts beat high
with hope, and from all sides congratulations poured in on me,
rejoicing that at last my patience would be rewarded. No one
doubted that the land would now be delivered into my hands.
But my hope almost died when, up to the year 1926-7, not one
inch of progress had been made, as I have said.
PA LEST IN E U N DER TH E TURKS
It has been a very long, varied, and dangerous experience, this
strain, lasting from the year 1889, for I have been extraordinarily
balked at every step.
I had sold another small piece of property on Mount Carmel,
contracting to put a wall around it. Each time I sent workmen to
build it, thirty or forty men at a time, the villagers of Tyrie,
where the property lies, stoned and beat my workmen; and again
the Turkish Government, after endless promises, gave no help
whatsoever, although the Tyriotes threatened to kill my agent
and myself, and attacked me as I walked along the road. These
were not idle threats, as this same village had recently killed, in a
dispute, a prominent young German colonist. My European
neighbours begged me not to yield, as there would be no safety
for them if I allowed the Tyriotes to master me.
I was domiciled, at this time, in an isolated Hostel Convent
on Mount Carmel, my room being far from the nuns in a lonely
wing of the building, and there were no other guests. I lived in
this one room doing my own work, and my own cooking on a
little lamp, so reduced had my means become through the
constant drains and losses I suffered. The house was only one
story high, and anyone could have shot me through the iron-
barred windows of my sleeping-room. One night, when the
storm-wind howled around the exposed wing I occupied and
the jackals added their dismal note, in this defenceless solitude,
tired out by a long strain of literary work, I became increasingly
nervous, expecting at each moment to see a dark face pressed to
my window, easily accessible from the ground, and a gun levelled
at me, for only that morning the Tyriotes had threatened mur­
derous violence. As the night advanced and the fierce storm
raged with increasing violence around my room, exposed on three
sides, my fear became almost uncontrollable. Again and again
I thought I saw wicked eyes glaring at me from the windows, such
eyes as I had seen daily when I encountered some of the Tyriotes
in my walks, and a nervous paroxysm seized me, which threatened
wholly to unbalance me.
I knelt in fervent prayer and instantly my fear vanished.
PA LESTIN E UNDER TH E TURKS 293
I went to bed and slept like a child, in spite of the fact that
there was no corner where I could safely place my bed, out of
the range of the Tyriote guns. From that time onward I was
entirely delivered from terror, although I remained at the Convent
some months longer, and the Tyriotes invaded the place more than
once and peered at me savagely through the low windows, with,
as the nuns said, “ murder in their eyes.”
Throughout these trials the Turkish Government helped me
not one particle in bringing these lawless fellaheen to reason,
and I was left to cope, unaided, with my difficulties pressing on
me from all sides.
Nevertheless, mine was at last the moral victory. Slowly,
but surely, through His constant help I have won my way.
Through prayer I was able to overcome the obstacles which
Turkish tyranny has been piling up during hundreds of years.
Through the help not only of our Lord, but the ever-present
influence of His Mother, the sweetest, meekest woman who ever
walked the earth, in sight of the place where I was struggling—
thus helped, did savagery yield, and my foes become at last my
friends. Through year-long sacrifices on my part two of the three
villages were won over. The Druses responsible for the most
hellish day of my life, have repeatedly begged me to return among
them, and promised that if I came I should live a protected life at
Dalieh; and even the Tyriotes and myself achieved peace. Only
Armageddon, among the native villages, remains unredeeme ,
unfriendly. f
The head Sheikh of Tyrie, a fine young savage, and myselt
have had a meeting, when my would-be murderer and I sat side
by side on a divan and came to an amicable arrangement. The
interview ended with a hearty laugh at some jokes of mine which
seemed vastly to amuse him, and murderous promptings do
not thrive in an atmosphere of hearty laughter. When we shook
hands at parting, I felt that the evil spirit had been exorcised.
On another occasion a grinding mill, in which I had a part
interest in payment of a debt, was the cause of much trouble.
My agent was thrown into the street, and the Government, as
usual, gave no protection. My antagonists, who were Russian
Jews of the low type, had been so fierce that no one would
accompany me to visit the mill. So I went alone to bring order
out of disorder.
When I first walked into the engine-room two savage-looking
M Y PERILO US L IF E IN PA LESTIN E
294
men glared at me viciously and seemed on the point of treating
me as they had my agent. I sent up a prayer and asked our Lord
and the Virgin Mary to form a gentler sphere, such a sphere as
She would have commanded had She been there in the flesh.
I was led to begin by admiring the engine, as I am fond of
machinery; presently we were examining together all its shining
parts. Then the men dusted a chair for me and brought me a
cooling drink; a sirocco was blowing and the smell of the oil
sickened me. My prayer was answered, for I could scarcely
recognize in these men, courteously caring for my comfort, the
fierce dark faces which had at first menaced me. When I joined
the Arabs who had been afraid to come with me, they were amazed
at the result of my visit. The engine was wrecked during the war.
TWO PROPHECIES
B u t s h o u ld a ll th in g s fa il, as th e y se e m e d to b e d o in g u p to th e
y e a r 1926, y e t w a s I le d to b e lie v e th a t I sh all su c ce e d th r o u g h
so m e u n fo re se e n h e lp , w h ic h c o u ld b e p e rc e iv e d o n ly b y faith .
This faith was strengthened by two prophetic visions which
were vouchsafed sometime before the war, the first a home y
little hint, the second of wider import.
In the first I saw a rose, the stem covered with silver paper.
This paper was rolled, presently, into two balls, the smaller ot
the two balls fell from the stem, while the second, the larger one,
adhered to it. I gathered from this that, although I was to lose
money temporarily, a substantial success was ensured to me in
the end, enabling me to do my work.
The second vision, which was of prophetic importance, made
a profound impression upon me, and this vision is now in
process of being fulfilled: ,
I saw a deep valley where the sunshine scarcely penetrated,
and in this valley a number of mechanical little figures moved
to and fro, actively advancing and receding as such figures do,
but this activity produced no result. This valley represented,
so I understood, an unenlightened country, modern Palestine,
and the mechanical figures were its inhabitants with their ineffec­
tive though bustling show of energy, which rarely brought my
affairs to a satisfactory, a practical conclusion.
Presently I saw a White Horse standing in the midst ot these
little figures which made no real progress by their movements,
and on this fine creature sat a Jew. In his arms he held his son
and heir. A horse signifies power, in the symbols used, as a sort
of shorthand, by the Voice, and the colour, white, typifies a
righteous power. .,
I understood this to mean that God’s promise to Israel would
be fulfilled, and that the Jews would return to the Holy Land,
not as they then were, under the harsh tyranny of the Turk,
but as a free people. . . , , ,
When I had saluted the Jew, an ever-burning light was placed
in my hand, and I floated, on happy wings, along the dark valley,
the spirit-light illumining its sombre recesses, as I was carried
296 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
from one end to the other by a Power not my own. I finally left
the valley through a very narrow egress.
God grant that my vision may be wholly fulfilled. May He
not only bring Israel back to Palestine, an Israel retaining their
love for their own great Prophets and all the dignity, all the
powerful Individuality of this foundation family. But an Israel
which shall be redeemed, sanctified, by the King of the earth, our
Lord Jesus Christ, adored as the supreme Head of all the Prophets,
while displacing none of them. Thus illumined, and not until
they are thus illumined, may Israel become, even as my vision
prophesied, a splendid Jew-Christian race wielding a righteous
power, for none but true Christians may fitly govern the Holy
Land.
TH E HELP FROM HEAVEN
In the teeth of the discouraging lack of success in my more
important undertakings, still burdening my life up to the year
1926, and crippling me in many ways so that I can never make
any settled plans and am always held in suspense, not being able
to render the services which I so long to do, yet the courage He
gives me does not fail. For in the midst of this trying uncertainty,
seemingly endless, my hope still lives and grows that eventually,
in the far-distant future, it may be, shall be established a mag­
nificent International Republic in Palestine, nobly planned and
nobly governed, as an example to other nations, a Republic in
which all things, because they are Spirit-guided, will be practically
well done. We are entering a wonderful age in which this dream
is not impossible in the Birthplace of the greatest Being who has
ever trod the earth. Considered even from the ordinary historical
standpoint, is He supreme, seeing that millions of men and
women still buy and read His Book, the Bible, and keep His
Birthday, Christmas.
Humanly speaking, mistrust should hold me in its paralysing
grip, but having seen Him I know, I ever continue to know,
no matter what may befall me, that, in the end He will conquer,
not only in Palestine, but throughout the earth, triumphantly,
gloriously. No believer, no matter of what creed, need be asked
to sacrifice his allegiance to his own revered Prophet, provided
he unites with all other believers in adoring Christ as the supreme
King of all Prophets, fully endowed by our Creator with the
capacity to meet every human need, not in a weak scheme
which removes all strength-testing obstacles, but by ever
lending us wings, if we choose to borrow them, when weary
feet fail.
I know this to be true, for my own tired feet have often quite
failed. I have had no strength left, and yet, when I have been
able to overcome by clinging to Christ, my whole being continues
to rise to God’s blue heaven, there to fling myself joyously
through splendid spaces of which no man and no fate can
rob me.

THE HELP FROM H EAVEN
In the teeth of the discouraging lack of success in my more

1926, and crippling me in many ways so that I can never make
any settled plans and am always held in suspense, not being able

This, then, is where I find myself in the years 1925-1926, my
80th year, after long and weary sufferings; and the miracle is
that through Him I am not weary, for my heart still sings and
my old feet still dance with a lightness my youth never knew.
If there is no God, no Christ, no spiritual world, from whence
does this gladness come? Certainly not from “ A Religion of
Humanity,” when the majority of my fellow-creatures have quite
failed me.
M Y VISION OF TH E JEW ON TH E W HITE HO RSE
Now that a rightful dominion has come to the Jew, what will
he do with it?
Now that he has a land of his own in Palestine where he is
becoming the dominant influence, a dominance his energy and
his remarkable gifts are bound to accentuate more and more, as
time goes on, what will be the result? Will he become the Jew
on the White Horse, the Jew of my prophetic vision, wielding a
righteous and not an aggressive power? Crushed as he has been,
it will not be surprising should there be a reaction into an undue
masterfulness, a masterfulness which may not only rouse antagon­
ism in his non-Jewish environment, but create fatal concussions
among the massed Jews themselves. God grant that the wise
leaders among the Jewish people may see the danger, and ever
counsel moderation; for Israel, splendidly endowed with true
humility, may become a leading nation, second to none; whereas
Israel, domineering, with arrogance, over the weaker peoples
among whom the Jews now dwell— this fatal reaction from
long oppression, although quite comprehensible, may bring them,
afresh, the dread hatreds from which they may now escape in
Palestine. Only the Wisdom of Love may win for them, in the
Holy Land, a righteous Power, the Power symbolized by the
White Horse, with the splendid rider proudly carrying his heir.
God grant that Jewry may choose this difficult, this hardly earned
wisdom.
Perceiving, as does a dweller in Palestine, the energy of the
freed Jew in his own land, astonishing in its virility, it may well
be asked, a little anxiously, Shall this remarkably efficient energy
be used to build or to destroy? Shall an eye for an eye be exacted,
thereby increasing blindness, or shall a love-lit vision be chosen,
thereby doubling sight?
May I not hope that the prophecy of the Jew on the White
Horse, the prophecy of a lofty Israel coming, at last, into its
true place, may be fulfilled in the great end, seeing that the
portion of the vision is spiritually, if not materially, fulfilled
which concerns my own small life?
ridiculous had they not been tragically hard, have 1 known, and
yet my cry has been, “ Lord, deliver me from my too great joy.”
He has put the ever-burning lamp into my hand; He has carried
me through that dark valley with its ceaseless and yet useless
show of energy, accomplishing very little. He has led me through
the narrow exit of my mean little trials; and He has carried me into
spaces so vast that I have no longer any doubt that an eternity
of joyful life is a reality, because the foretaste of eternity has
already been given me.
May it not be true, then, that Israel also may arise, remaining
for ever Israel, and yet blessing backward Palestine as it never
yet has been blessed, because it is a Christian Israel, proudly
great and yet most meekly humble, losing none of its great
ancient Prophets, while furnishing present Prophets yet greater;
nevertheless, yielding itself unreservedly into the holy keeping
of the Nazarene who forgave utterly when crucified most cruelly?
They, the Jews, are coming into His Land; may God grant
that they may enter also into His Kingdom, so that welcomed and
beloved they may bring at last Peace to Palestine.
If my hard, narrow, stiff-necked little self has been so blessed,
may I not hope that this great Race may rise from its depths of
suffering to glorious heights, now that their year-long petition
is being answered?
May Jewry come into its heritage at last, through a splendid
patience, even as my vision foretold, the prophetic vision of the
White Horse, and may that victory be achieved by finding the
supreme Jew, who built on Jewry, Christianity.
What must Israel accept in order to become a Christian
Israel? Must Jews sacrifice one fine of their splendid lore; lose
any part of their dignified antiquity; forget any chapter of their
age-old history; and discard any symbol of their long-observed
rituals? In short, must they cease to be Jews because they have
become Christians? N o; individuality is a precious thing to be
most preciously preserved, but preserved not through antago­
nistic rivalries, but through an accordant and yet diversified Unity.

A P ro ph ecy F u lfilled
O n e afternoon, when I was sitting on my veranda, shortly after
I had returned to Palestine after visiting my home, several young
men I knew called to see me, bringing with them a new arrival,
the son of a Consul established at Haifa, pro tem., until the
resident French Vice-Consul arrived.
This young man, whom I will call Carlos, did not make much
impression on me, for he seemed to be a highly excitable person,
talking almost incessantly.
I found that although his father was acting as French Consul,
this lad was, in truth, part Spanish and part Italian, his strongly
marked face being more Spanish than Italian.
A day or two later he called again, and after a few moments’
conversation seemed to be irresistibly drawn to the fine Steinway
piano, which our Scotch friend had given us as a wedding-gift.
After a few chords he began to sing, and my delighted ears
drank in the sound, for he had a beautiful voice, and the one
I love best, a robust tenor, almost a baritone, little trained, it
is true, but it was evident that he was a born musician, for his
style was perfect, simple and yet subtly artistic.
He rambled on, when he had finished singing, improvising
with fine skill.
He asked me if he might come to practise, sometimes, as they
had sold their own piano on leaving their home to come to Haifa,
and had not yet bought another. I told him he was quite welcome,
and could come as often as he liked.
He visited me almost daily after this, and began to compose
an Ave Maria, which seemed to me to show a marked talent, a
verdict afterwards confirmed by well-known musicians.
But I found that he was in so highly nervous a condition that
he could remain on the piano-stool only about fifteen minutes
at a time. He told me that he slept, as a rule, only two or three
hours in the night, and sometimes scarcely closed his eyes. He

“ The Rock of Gibraltar symbolizes the work which awaits

A P ro ph ecy F u lfilled
O ne afternoon, when I was sitting on my veranda, shortly after
I had returned to Palestine after visiting my home, several young
men I knew called to see me, bringing with them a new arrival,
the son of a Consul established at Haifa, pro tem.y until the
resident French Vice-Consul arrived.
This young man, whom I will call Carlos, did not make much
impression on me, for he seemed to be a highly excitable person,
talking almost incessantly.
I found that although his father was acting as French Consul,
this lad was, in truth, part Spanish and part Italian, his strongly

But I found that he was in so highly nervous a condition that
he could remain on the piano-stool only about fifteen minutes
at a time. He told me that he slept, as a rule, only two or three
hours in the night, and sometimes scarcely closed his eyes. He
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
302
had graduated at sixteen, and taken an Honour’s B.A. degree
with men of twenty-four or five, and since then had learnt
several languages, as he was constantly studying. When he could
not sleep he spent the night poring over his books.
I soon began to perceive that this was no ordinary lad, for he
was still only a boy, but I feared that his talents would become
useless through ill health.
We were much drawn to each other, having many interests
in common, and it was a great pleasure to find an intellectual
companion, for my life was very barren.
After we had become friends, he told me his history: when he
had graduated and left College he began going into society in
one of the large Oriental towns. He found, however, that the
worldly atmosphere did not suit him, and although he was a
good deal sought after, for he was a gay and entertaining talker,
an accomplished dancer, besides being gifted in music, he felt
out of his element, and he did not wish to waste his time in this
frivolous manner.
He then decided to enter a Jesuit Convent, where he remained
for two years. Here his health broke down, failing completely
after a Retreat of thirty days, during which he was not allowed
to speak to anyone. His nerves seemed to give way and he was a
wreck.
After a good deal of heart-burning, he had left the Convent
two or three months before he came to Haifa. Again the pleasures
of the world both allured and repelled him, and he was in a
miserable state of mind and body. A few days before he had
seen me, he had gone to Communion to beseech the Lord for
help, for he felt that he was reaching a crisis in his life. The
monastic life did not suit him, and the world did not suit him;
where, then, was he to find rest?
Two or three days after he had offered up this earnest prayer
for help to resist the world, the flesh, and the devil, even while
he remained a denizen of the world, he met me, and it had seemed
to him on closer acquaintance that I was the person God had sent
to give him the help which he so much needed.
A few days after this conversation, we were sitting on the
veranda, when a company of young people, the fashionable set
of Haifa, passed the house on the way to the sea.
Carlos turned very pale as he looked after them.
“ What is the matter, my boy,” I said.
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR 303
“ I am invited to a dance at the house of the H------’s on
Thursday night, and I always go to Communion early Friday
morning. The dance will last until very late, and I cannot go to
this ball, go to Communion, and study my appointed task the
next day. I will not give up the Communion, so I must give up
the dance, and I am obliged to go down to the beach now and
tell them my decision. I dread it, for I know they will ridicule
me and try to force me to give up going to Communion.”
He rose and followed them to the sea. Presently he returned
and said that when the company found they could not persuade
him to put off going to Communion, they decided to put off the
ball until the following Monday, as they were very anxious he
should be present.
A few days afterwards there was to be a fashionable luncheon
on a French warship lying in the harbour. His father, being the
Consul, was, of course, invited as an honoured guest, and he
wished Carlos to accompany him.
“ My boy,” I said, “ I want to ask a favour of you, and one you
will find it difficult to grant, I fear.”
“ I shall certainly not refuse to do anything you ask me,” he
said, “ if I can possibly agree to your request.”
“ I should be glad if you would refuse wine and tobacco at the
luncheon to be given on the French ship, and not join in any of
the vulgar stories which may be told, or even to laugh at them.
I understand there will be only men, no ladies, hence there will be
no restraint.”
Carlos again turned white to the Ups, with the quick pallor
of the high-strung temperament.
He leaned back in his chair without answering, and I noticed
how strong a face he had. The virile black curly hair; the shapely,
but large aquihne nose; the big, dark eyes, with their flashing
fights; the firmly closed lips; the well-cut chin—all denoted
strength, and there were also fines which indicated a high temper.
One could see that it was possible for him to get very angry,
and that when he was roused he would be a formidable enemy.
He was not at all of the gentle type to which Bedi-Allah belonged.
Even his voice, though a tenor, bordered on a baritone, possessing
both in singing and in speaking, strongly masculine vibrations.
He was an embodiment, so it seemed to me, of the best Spanish
character, and this is a noble strain of blood.
Presently he turned to me and said:
3°4 M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
“ You realize that my own father will ridicule me and say I
am behaving foolishly?”
“ No, I did not realize it, and this will make a test, which is
already sufficiently difficult, still harder. No doubt you admire
these officers, and may even stand somewhat in awe of them,
especially when they are on their own ship, and hence assume the
authority of naval commanders.”
Carlos bent his head in silent assent, and then wandered off
into the garden, where he walked up and down for some time;
then he came back and said:
“ It is no use to talk in the air. I have affirmed that I wish to live
in the world, and yet not to be of it. Here is an opportunity to
show whether I am in earnest or not. I intend to do as you wish.”
“ I thank you, Carlos. I am proud of you.”
“ Don’t thank me yet, for the luncheon is not over and perhaps
I shah fail.”
“ I don’t think so,” I said. “ Once you have given your word,
I believe you will keep it.”
On returning from the warship he came immediately to my
home.
“ I think I have pulled through fairly well,” he said, “ but I
came so near to failing, that I feel no great sense of elation.”
I drew him down and kissed him on the top of his curly black
head. There was no trace of wine or tobacco about him, and his
clear, honest eyes looked straight into mine. Afterwards several
of his companions told me that although he was something of a
laughing-stock, he adhered to his resolution.
It was a hard trial, for it was not easy for a boy like Carlos
to resist these worldly officers, backed by the prestige of their
naval authority. Their ridicule might well have influenced a
man much older than this young lad and turned him from his
purpose.
But, so I was told, he stuck manfully to his resolve to the end,
although the conversation was more coarsely witty than usual,
possibly for the purpose of forcing Carlos to join in the laughter
which followed each sally.
“ But,” as Carlos said afterwards, “ one cannot go to Commu­
nion, and then fill one’s mouth with foul talk.”
Had he been less gay, less musically gifted, his influence would
not have been so pronounced among the young people of the
town. But seeing that he was always the centre of fun, and that
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR 3oj
no party was considered a complete success without him, they
knew that the serious vein running through his character was
genuine. He had far more power for good, because he was not
a solemn bore.
After two or three months Carlos’ family left Haifa for Cairo.
A week or two before their departure Carlos came to me and
said :
“ I do not wish to leave you, for I feel that I need your in­
fluence. Will you take me into your home, for a time at any
rate, if my father and mother consent?”
Let me pray about it. Personally it would be a great pleasure
to me, but I do not know, as yet, what the Will of God may be.”
Owing to his knowledge of languages, the French Foreign
Office had at this time made him the offer of a promising position
in the Constantinople Embassy.
The next day he came again, and I said to him:
“ This is the answer which has been given, after asking God to
guide me.
“ I will be very glad to take you into my home on the following
condition:
“ I will do what lies in my power to give you an education in
music, if you will devote your talent to the service of God.”
“ It has been my dream to be an apostle through music,” said
Carlos. “ It has never been quite clear to me how, when, or where
I could follow my ideal, but for several years this desire has moved
me potently. Hence I can agree to your condition with all my
heart. For I prefer this service to any success I may be able to
win in a diplomatic career.”
I had an interview with his parents, who consented to leave
Carlos with me, and shortly afterwards he came to my home.
Then a strange thing befell us, an experience lasting fifteen
long and trying years, before we achieved a victory.
Carlos was Spanish and Italian; I was Scotch, Welsh, and
Puritan.
Carlos was a Roman Catholic; I was a Protestant.
Carlos had been bred by the Jesuits, and I had grown up in
the free-thinking American village of my grandfather, Robert
Owen.
Carlos was an artist belonging to the emotional Latin race;
I was seeking to be a philosopher, and was of the Scotch type,
U
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
306
accepting, with difficulty, anything that could not be logically
proved, mathematically demonstrated.
His family lived luxuriously in the French style. Elaborate
meals, tobacco, wines, liveried servants, gay company, etc.
Whereas my habits were of the simplest, most strict, and most
retired kind, and nearly the whole of my time was devoted to
hard work.
In a word, I found, as our acquaintance progressed, that when
he liked a thing hot, I liked it cold; when he liked it short, I liked
it long; when he liked it round, I liked it square. Our tastes, our
habits, our education, and our temperaments were totally
different. We had only one thing in common, a deep love for
Jesus Christ, and for the Holy Mary, for whom, although I am
a Protestant, I feel a passionate devotion.
I foresaw, then, that it would not be easy to establish complete
harmony between us, especially as he was in so highly nervous
a state that, sometimes, he could not sit still for five minutes.
At meals, for instance, he ate most rapidly, and then raced
around the table, talking with nervous excitability, until I had
finished my repast. I am a quiet-nerved person, but his restlessness
was sometimes hard to bear when I was very tired.
I perceived, however, that it was a nervous disease, and not
a flippant character which made him seem so unhinged.
His brothers and friends had all said to me, “ Carlos has brilliant
talents, but he will never accomplish anything, for he has no
perseverance, no steadiness of purpose.”
I thought they were mistaken, and that the trouble was, to a
great extent, physical.
So I asked him, from the beginning, to reform his habits.
He agreed, and by degrees cut off tobacco, wine, coffee, tea, and
late, heavy meat dinners.
He grew so weak under this change, at first, that he almost
fainted in the street; but I found that he was sleeping more and
more soundly until, at last, it was difficult to get him out of bed
in the morning, and his nerves grew much quieter in every
respect, so it seemed well to persevere.
Both he and I, then, grew hopeful for his future.
In spite of the great differences between us, he had shown, so
far, a reasonable spirit, and a firm perseverance in reforming the
habits, which evidently did not suit him. As he was very high
strung by nature, he certainly did not need to be whipped up
3°7
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
afresh by a highly stimulating diet, and he had the good sense to
perceive this and the self-control enabling him to adhere to his
resolution.
We were beginning to settle down into a regular and studious
life, he learning English with marvellous quickness, besides
continuing his studies in his other languages.
He began to like the simple and regular life of my home—
indeed I think, as a rule, true students, no matter of what race,
prefer regularity and simplicity— and all seemed to be going well.
He was now growing not only much less nervous, but also much
stronger.
And now came the strange experience to which I have alluded,
which made my life seem lonelier than when I lived quite alone.
At this juncture the Catholic element began to realize that
Carlos was not a mere visitor in my house, but was settling down,
permanently, as a member of my family. A storm then arose,
growing so violent, at last, that not only the priests and nuns
were affected, but the new French Consul, replacing Carlos’
father, asked the boy to leave me, because I was an heretical
Protestant.
The cloistered nuns, living just out of Haifa, sent word to
Carlos that they were all joining in a nine days’ prayer in order
to separate him from me, a Protestant. The priests visited him
in order to expostulate with him, for the same reason, and finally
two of his brothers, who were Jesuit priests, threatened to detain
him by force when he went on business to Beyrouth. But Carlos
took a small coasting steamer, a tramp not under the surveillance
of the priests, and got back to me.
Curiously enough, these conscientious Roman Catholic priests,
sure that they were right, repeated the same phrase concerning
their brother that Murray’s conscientious Scotch Presbyterian
friends, also sure that they were right, had used concerning
Laurence and myself.
“ We would rather see you dead than have you remain with
Madame Oliphant.” Thus, I was condemned, in similar words,
by the good men of two widely separated Churches.
As a matter of fact, during the many years that Carlos has now
lived in my house, we have discussed Catholicism versus Protest­
antism during about ten minutes.
We began one night to talk about the infallibility of the Pope,
but after a short discussion I said:
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
308
“ It is not likely, Carlos, that the Pope will enter practically
into our lives. He certainly won’t come to live with us. So we
can each hold our own opinion, and when we get to Heaven
we shall discover who is right. Until then it will not affect our
daily movements, is it not true?”
We talked about the Bible and its teachings during many
hours; we sought to live up to these teachings during many long
and difficult years; but, with the exception of this ten minutes,
we spent no time in discussing our respective Churches. Hence
the fear of his brothers that I should seek to draw him away from
his Church was quite ill-founded. The form was immaterial to
me, it was the Essence I sought. I asked that God should take the
place of self.
Carlos was led to take, at the Communion Service, the following
threefold vow : he promised to be, with the help of our Lord and
the Holy Mary, Sweet, Meek, and Pure, and, as he often said, the
effort to keep his vow was so great that he had no time left to
trouble about disputed differences of creed.
In so far, then, as he has been driven away from his own Church,
the estrangement has been caused by the year-long and ever-
renewed attack of the Jesuit priests, who gave him no peace.
I was always spoken of as a wicked and dangerous woman,
and as he knew this to be false, the Catholic Church gradually
lost its hold upon him, so far as some of its priests and their
ceremonies were concerned, but he has ever held firmly by its
Creed, in essential doctrines.
For a year or two, however, he was an almost daily communi­
cant, and I in nowise discouraged him, and arranged our meals
to suit his convenience, for it seemed to me that he needed, during
this period, the help of the services of his Church.
When the attack of the priests began, I noted in Carlos the
change of which I have spoken:
Whereas there had been a remarkable harmony between us,
considering the differences which divided us, he was now seized
with an antipathy which he seemed unable to overcome. It
lasted during fifteen years, and finally broke down his health,
the health which is so essential to a singer, and which had been
improving so rapidly. I thought a little change might help
matters. So we went to Jerusalem, which I had not visited. But
although our stay was most interesting, Carlos seemed like a
man possessed of an evil spirit. He could scarcely speak to me.
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR 309
On our return, the strange obsession continued, making
both of us miserably uncomfortable, and I began to wonder
whether it would not be best for him to return to his family.
One evening Carlos had gone to pay a visit and I sat alone,
pondering over the question, when the mysterious prophecy
of the Voice was recalled to m e:
“ The Rock of Gibraltar symbolizes the work which awaits
you in Palestine.”
The Voice then explained to me this riddle:
“ The Rock is an English fortress on Spanish ground. The
mission of a fortress is to resist the enemy. You and Carlos have
been brought together to resist the world, the flesh, and the devil,
i.e. the enemy. He belongs to the Spanish race, you belong to
the English race. Is it not true, then, that the Rock of Gibraltar
is typical of your present work, for are you not as an English
fortress, set on his Spanish ground, to resist Satan, the enemy
of all mankind? You have promised, with the help of God, to
give, toforgive, to believe, no matter how difficult it may be to keep
your vows.
“ He has promised, with the help of God, to be sweet, to be meek,
and to bepure, no matter how difficult it is to keep his vows.
“ If you are true to your words, you will succeed in the end; if
not you will fail, and if you fail you are not true Christians, for
the central Power holding you together, is neither race, a com­
mon Church, nor compatibility of temperament, but only Christ.
If you love Him better than self you will not fail in your task
and separate. If you love self better than your Saviour, then you
will fail in your task and become as strangers, for you are warned
that this is the sole link that can possibly hold you together.
“ In addition we give you one simple rule: Judge Carlos not
by his conduct to you, but by his conduct to others.”
I realized after the Voice had given me this explanation, that
the advent of Carlos in my house had been clearly prophesied,
and that we were meant to persevere, no matter what difficulties
we had to encounter, and I may say here that these difficulties
proved to be enormous.
If there is such a thing as telepathy, and if there are adepts in
throwing thought to a distance, then certainly Carlos was a
victim of this art; for on thousands of occasions I have seen him
come into my presence his natural, gay self, and in ten minutes
he seemed to age ten years. There were times when he looked
M Y PERILOUS LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
310
as though he would like to kill me; and that the hate was not
self-born, not voluntarily felt, was proved by the fact that he
ever entreated me, when this curse was upon him, to kneel with
him and to beseech our Lord to deliver him from evil. On days
of especial importance the attack grew stronger, so strong that
Carlos sometimes seemed to be beside himself, growing either
furiously, almost dangerously, angry at some slight word of
mine, or else falling into a moody silence. Sometimes I scarcely
knew which way to turn to keep the peace.
But the Voice ever reminded me that I must judge him by his
conduct to others, which came to be a difficult task; for as time
went on 1 grew ever poorer, so poor, at last, that I had to deny
myself even the necessities of life to be faithful to my promise to
help Carlos. And he also suffered severely, because, although I
gave him the lion’s share of the little we had, he was by no means
luxuriously situated, and had to work his way as a musician and
a linguist with very little help from me for scholastic expenses.
I could only manage to give him a poor home while he studied.
When I was almost hungry, and had not enough clothes to
keep me warm, because I was sharing my small income with him,
it was very difficult not to judge him when, after some marked
rudeness or neglect of me, he would turn to serve others with
ready kindness.
Yet I perceived that the simple rule given me was indeed
sufficient, when I refused to be sorry for myself, and so was not
blinded; for Carlos devoted himself, with an increasing earnest­
ness, not only to the powerful and rich, but to the poor and needy,
being ever ready to sacrifice himself for others, when that sacri­
fice brought him no personal advantage whatsoever.
So I often had a strange experience. He would fly into a
passion when I asked for some slight service, which, with my
slender strength, I could not perform for myself; and the next
hour he would devote himself, with an almost pathetic patience,
to some tediously exacting claimant. Yet the claimant greatly
bored and tried him; whereas, in his normal moments, he always
said that I was the best, the truest friend God had ever sent him.
I dislike mysteries, and am ever seeking for some common-
sense explanation, but I was unable to explain this experience
through any ordinary reasoning. I knew that Carlos had a strong
affection for me, for he proved it more than once; yet, in spite
of all his resistance, and against his will, he sometimes treated
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR 3*1
me abominably, whereas to those for whom he had no affection
whatever, and from whom he gained nothing but trouble, he
ever showed the kindest and most self-sacrificing courtesy.
“ I cannot help it,” he would cry, “ my conduct to you shames
me, until I am humbled to the dust; every gentlemanly instinct
in me revolts against it, and yet I fall into the same sin again and
again. In one sense I cannot blame myself, for I am utterly help­
less; yet in another I despise myself, and am ashamed to call
myself a Christian, for I return evil for a goodness which has not
failed me during all these unhappy years.”
Can the reader explain so mysterious a dispensation save in
one way?
God permitted the influence, sent across space by our powerful
and mentally trained enemies, found either in this world or the
next, to dominate Carlos, because we both needed to learn,
perhaps more than the average man and woman, that without
Him we can do nothing.
Again and again and yet again, we knelt side by side with
clasped hands, the tears streaming over our faces, beseeching
Christ to deliver us, but during fifteen long years we had no
answer to our prayers.
That we had enemies, and that they continued to hate me and
to try and separate us, was proved by the letters which were
constantly being received by Carlos, until the very sight of the
familiar handwritings turned him cold with dread.
Again I was tempted to ask, “ What is their religion worth?
and in answer the Voice showed me, at last, in one magnificent
instant, the true Church of Christ, while I was helplessly beseech­
ing to be kept from breaking the vow I had made to forgive
always:
In vast circles, as far as the eye could reach, stood the saints
and martyrs of every Creed, wing joined to splendid wing;
and as this feathered phalanx ranged tier above tier, an amphi­
theatre built of human souls was symmetrically formed, such as
no T
inman architect ever imagined. Every diversity was joined
as a unity, because, rising above this massed human power,
floated our Saviour, made in the image of our dual God; and His
double-streaming effulgence fused each man and woman into an
all-absorbing Heavenly Harmony.
“ So great and so splendid is the Church of Christ, said the
Voice,“ then forget the present fanatical blindness ofyour enemies,
M Y PERILOUS LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
312
because, in the end, the Roman Catholic Church will add a magni­
ficent chord to the Harmony o f Heaven, a fact foreshadowed in
its present music, more dignified than that of any other Church.”
I accepted the rebuke and struggled on as best I could in my
own little place, which seemed to be growing ever smaller and
meaner; for, as the years rolled by, we finally became so poor
that I had to act as a servant, in a little house in an English
village, and opened the door to Carlos’ pupils, who, until they
came to know me, treated me as though I were his elderly house­
keeper and maid-of-all-work combined.
Seeing that I had been the great lady and he my protégé in
the beginning, this seemed to be rather a reversal of positions.
But our Lord is great; for, sometimes, when I stood at the
foot of the stairs, in our little home, so tired I seemed unable to
get to the top step after a heavy day of manual toil, He lifted me
in His arms and carried me to my bed, and so refreshed was I
often that I could have begun the hard day all over again.
There is only one thing in this world that is of supreme
importance: to hold fast to our Lord Jesus Christ, always and
under all circumstances, for when we are filled with His Life,
every difficult fate is changed to a glorious triumph.
I was willing that all the hard Presbyterians and the censorious
Lutherans and the fanatical Jesuits, through whom I had suffered,
should rain blows upon me, if, in the end, I was taught to draw
closer and closer to my Lord, excluding none who would come
with me.
So I prayed from the depths of my soul to be allowed to bring
all my enemies at last, hand clasped in hand, to His Mercy
Seat. Seeing that the mission of building the glorious Church of
Christ awaits us, it did not seem worth while to lose my time in
anger or self-pity, when one moment of Christian Unity will
atone, in the end, for the centuries of discord Satan has sought
to foster, in order to hide from us our heavenly privileges.
Jesus Christ is going to conquer in the end. This fact I set
before me, and I sought not to forget this truth no matter how
long and seemingly devious the path might be.
So I cooked and swept and dusted, and was shabby and
snubbed, but I grew increasingly happy, until the problem was
how to keep my dancing feet still, and to behave as befitted a
person of my years.
Would that I could share this experience with the whole
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR 3x3
burdened world of aged labourers, groaning under their loads—
loads which He can lift in a moment, if only one asks Him
fervently enough.
At the time that the meaning of the Rock of Gibraltar was
explained to me, we were still at the beginning of the long
difficulties I have been outlining, difficulties lasting over fifteen
years; but had I foreseen them all, I should still have taken this
exceptionally strong and exceptionally gifted youth into my
home.
After Carlos had been with me some time I found that the
business of Armageddon would detain me in Haifa, so I decided
to send him to Italy and to join him there later.
He succeeded brilliantly, passing at the end of six months
an examination which the other pupils in the Conservatoire
required three years to compass. He took, in addition, private
lessons from one of the best teachers in Italy, who set him as
an example before his other pupils, and presented him at a public
performance.
When I reached Italy he looked well and happy, although he
had been working very hard. But before one week had passed
the former obsession seized him and he was a changed man.
There were times when he seemed unable to bear the sight of
me.
One day he returned from a lesson in stage deportment
required by the Conservatoire, and said to me:
“ Signor F. has insisted to-day, that in order to be a good singer
I must have a mistress.”
Signor F. was a celebrated man, training opera-singers for the
stage, and many successful, and some widely noted, artists had
passed through his hands.
The blood flew fiercely to my head, and I felt that I was in
no condition to answer, so I said to Carlos, “ I cannot speak on
this subject now, because I am too angry to be reasonable, but
if you will wait until to-morrow I will pray for guidance.”
The next evening we had a quiet moment, and I said to
him:
“ You have told me that there are a number of pictures and
sculptured images of the Holy Mary and of the saints in Signor
F.’s rooms, did you not?”
314 M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PA LESTIN E
“ Yes,” said Carlos, “ there are several pictures of the Blessed
Virgin, and other sacred paintings, on the walls of his handsome
studio. You understand that Signor F. is as good as most men,
agreeable, well bred, and acknowledged to be one of the finest
masters in stage deportment. He is much better known and much
more successful than you are, and he expresses what many men,
perhaps most men, think. How, then, am I to know that you,
with your strict notions of morality, ridiculously strict it seems
to me, are right; and that Signor F. and other men are wrong?
Are you not placing an impossible ideal before me, when you ask
me, a Southerner and an artist, with the hot blood coursing
through my veins, to lead a perfectly pure life? I am not an old
woman like you, but a young man with strong passions, which
I am ever tempted to gratify. Aye, furiously tempted sometimes,
for I do not belong to your cold-blooded race.”
Carlos stood before me with flashing eyes, his black, curly
head thrown back in mutinous revolt, his strong and rather
sensuous features working angrily, his whole muscular body
tense with resistance.
“ I tell you I cannot and I will not bear your chains any longer.
So far I have kept my word to you and have lived a pure fife, but
I am a man, and I warn you that I intend to be free and do as I
like. Signor F. understands the needs of an artist, and you, what
do you know about it?”
He turned from me with a gesture of contempt and was about
to leave the room.
I sent up a cry to the Lord to help me, for I felt we were
reaching a crisis, a crisis so dangerous that even the Rock of
Gibraltar might totter under Satan’s assaults; for I saw, with a
sudden clear sight, that it is he, the evil one, who blinds men,
even good men, making them believe that a short and poor
physical pleasure, having a reaction into disgust and possibly
into loathsome disease, pays.
Were there no power of evil, all sensible men would see that
prostitution, which is all evil and owns no virtue whatsoever, is
not worth while, even as most well-bred men are beginning to
see that drunkenness is not worth while, the price to be paid being
far greater than the advantage to be reaped; namely, the dis­
gusting delirium of the sot. But so fierce and so subtle is Satan’s
onslaught, where sex-temptation is concerned, that I perceived
that I must indeed be as the Rock to resist his evil influence.
TH E RO CK OF G IBRA LTA R 3*5
“ Carlos,” I said, “ do not go, for I have something to say to
you. I wish you to ask Signor F. a question.”
Carlos flung himself into a chair and impatiently waited for me
to speak.
“ Ask Signor F. whether he thinks it would be possible to place
the Holy Mary and a prostitute side by side, mingling their
images in your soul.
“ He will say, I think, that to put the Blessed Mary and a fallen
woman together as equal claimants, as familiar boon companions,
is impossible. That being so, you must make a choice between
the Holy One and the cocotte. Either you must exclude the
Blessed Mary from your daily consciousness, or you must exclude
the cocotte. In making this choice, ask Signor F. which he thinks
will give you the truer inspiration as an artist, the Heaven-taught
Mary or the hell-tempted prostitute?”
Carlos dropped his face in his hands and said with a sob in
his voice, “ You are right and the men of the world are wrong,
for Christ has commanded us not even to look at a woman
lustfully. He, having given the command, will certainly show us
how we may obey Him, without losing our health or our inspira­
tion. I will put the question to Signor F. to-morrow, as you have
wished me to do so.”
When Carlos returned from his lesson, I asked him what
Signor F. had replied.
“ He had not a word to say. He dropped his head, and seemed
unable to look me in the face. What could he say, for it would be
blasphemy to affirm that a prostitute is more powerfully inspiring
than the Immaculate One, and hence that we should choose the
prostitute and reject the Bride in order to become good artists
and healthy, virile men.”
I may here add that Carlos gradually discovered, after many
years of perseverance, a way of living which enabled him to do
an immense amount of work without breaking down, and at the
same time to lead a perfectly innocent life, which he has consis­
tently done, from that day to this. To utilize a splendid virility
through a purity including all noblest creative uses is the central
need, so he discovered. But such an ideal requires a long and
difficult endeavour. His vow was not easy to keep.
He avoided all stimulants and narcotics, for he found that when
he drank wine, for pleasure’s sake, smoked, ate heavy and
316 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PALESTIN E
frequent meals, with a quantity of meat; namely, when he loosely
indulged his senses, it was impossible to be both pure and virile
in his works and life.
When he kept all his appetites and senses well under control,
using a stimulant only when necessary, and above all, when
through prayer he turned the strong sex-life he possessed into
channels of usefulness, especially into his mission as a singer of
religious music, he felt well and he worked splendidly. He
was tired sometimes, for he laboured hard, but he revived
quickly.
It took a number of years for him to learn his lesson thoroughly,
so that he substituted concentration for looseness of purpose;
but now that he has been taught how to live, he rejoices in the
freedom it has conferred upon him.
Like Murray, he has dropped his sex-chains, not by growing
sterile, but by growing prayerfully virile, the Scotchman and the
Spaniard having had the same experience.
It may not be necessary for all men to be as strict in diet as
Carlos had the courage to be, so long as his fiercely tempted
years lasted, for he was a hot-blooded Southerner. But should
not every good man take the trouble to study his own nature,
and to avoid habits which lead him into temptation, or give a
harmful example to others? If he is not capable of this much
self-control, may he claim the right to see his God face to
face?
The task is to set purity, a virile, creative purity, as the chief
aim; and each man must discover for himself how he may best
attain this end, and must have the strength to persevere in his
chosen way. As Christ has told each striver that he must be
spotless not only in act but in thought, it is certain that He will
show to every prayerful man, married or single, how His com­
mand may be implicitly obeyed, without loss, and only with gain.
The dual Creator does not wish to rob men of a divine creative­
ness.
When the whole world joins the great purity-clad army, the
Battle of Armageddon will be won, and may one not hope when
two such different types as Murray the Scotchman, and Carlos
the Spaniard, have marched under Christ’s dual-streaming white
banner, that many other good men will soon follow?
Shall these soldiers lose any precious pleasure or privilege?
No, a thousand times no, for one exquisite kiss, given in the
TH E RO CK OF G IBRA LTA R 317
presence of God, thrilling every fibre of soul and body with
delight, has more value than all the debauches which have taken
place since the world began.
The holy joy of true lovers is limitless, whereas the unholy
joy of prostituted men and woman is snatched from them, ere
it is well tasted. Should a sensualist read these words, he knows
in his secret soul that they are true.
We beseech the reader to reform his life, persistently, thor­
oughly, strenuously, not to make him poorer, but in order to
make him infinitely richer, so that the slightest touch of true
love, aye, even the sights and sounds of God s beautiful world,
will thrill him with a sensuous delight so pure that His angels
may drink with him from the same Communion cup.
The Creator has promised this joy, and He keeps His promises.
The great change to be made is to utilize, and never to abuse,
sex-virility. It should be neither paralysed nor prostituted, but
should be made to serve purely, potently, wherever there is
lofty work to be done. This noble use may be discovered by
ever praying to the Creator to direct, unerringly, love’s radia­
tions, whenever a sex-emotion is felt.
It took a long time for Carlos to learn this lesson, but through
an endless perseverance he has now begun to perceive, dimly,
the secret of Christ’s new Commandment. Sex-love has existed
since the world began, but a creative love which wastes nothing,
but which utilizes all pure power, this divine secret has not yet
been discovered. When it has been learnt, the human family
will be saved, for to create, through the Power borrowed from
the Creator, usefully, increasingly, unerringly, and most purely,
with no wasteful reactions, ensures an immortal fife.
When Carlos had successfully finished his arduous studies
in Naples, we went to London, and in the great city where one
can be so easily lost, we began a protracted struggle.
On the ship, when he began to sing, everyone was attracted,
and the warmest praise lavished on him; but when we reached
London we encountered difficulties which seemed insur­
mountable. . . .
The onslaught on Carlos, both through letters from without
and Satan from within, continued with virulent force. In addition,
he took, being in an exhausted condition, a heavy chill on reaching
j i 8 M Y PERILO US L IF E IN PA LESTIN E
London, and for years suffered from ulceration of the bowels and
loss of blood.
We had very little money, and I had been so long out of the
world that I had lost track of my friends, and those I could trace
were alienated through the attack which had been made upon
us. All doors seemed to be closed. Finally, through the strictest
economy, we managed to give a concert, and he made some friends
who gave him opportunities of singing; but, with unfailing pre­
cision, whenever he had the chance of being heard in an important
engagement, a letter of abuse came from his blinded friend-
enemies. The worry and strain of the whole situation brought on
haemorrhage, and although he had the courage to appear on the
platform and sing through a heavy programme when he was
barely able to stand, his voice was weak and impaired. He never
failed, but he did not achieve the triumph which places a man in
the front rank.
Again and again we had this experience, the letter or letters
often coming on the very day of the concert, until we had to
battle with despair, for it almost seemed as though God had
forsaken us.
Those who heard him on less important occasions, when he
was not so severely attacked, marvelled that he had not at once
reached a high place.
This struggle continued for fifteen long years, but Carlos
persevered. He had taken a Maestro’s degree at the Conservatoire,
and he studied constantly to perfect himself as a musician, until
he had a thorough grasp of his art.
Finally, he was asked to sing in Stainer’s Crucifixion in a small
church. He was so weak when he started to the church that he
could scarcely walk; we knelt in prayer beseeching His help;
and I did not cease my petition throughout the evening. He sang
like an inspired man, people speaking of it for months afterwards.
A few pupils began to come after this effort, finding their way to
our humble lodgings, and our situation grew less difficult.
Presently a leading role was written for him in an opera
suiting the range of his voice. But he was pursued by intrigues,
fomented by one of the leading singers, the part was given to
another, and he was allowed a hearing only on a night (Friday)
when there were no critics. He had been excluded from all the
full rehearsals by this influential singer in the company, who
evidently wished him to fail, so that he appeared before a crowded
TH E RO CK OF G IBRA LTA R 319
London audience in an exacting role, never having set foot on
a stage, never having sung with an orchestra, and never having
worn a stage costume. He had a severe haemorrhage during the
week, brought on by the strain through which he was passing,
and spent the day in bed almost too weak to breathe. We feared a
complete failure, but we struggled to renew our faith and spent
the day in prayer.
When the curtain rang up, I sent a cry to the Lord not to let
him fail ignominiously; his voice was weak, but beautiful in
tone, and his acting astonished me. He was perfectly at ease on
the stage, and looked quite handsome.
I said to some friends near me, “ Would anyone believe that
Carlos has never set foot on a stage, nor sung with an orchestra
until this night?”
A stranger near me turned and said:
“ Nonsense, madam, that young man is a thoroughly trained
actor, and of no mean talent. No novice could dominate the stage
as he is doing. He is admirable, and were his voice stronger he
would have a fine future before him.
But the success proved to be of no use, as the critics had given
a full account of the opera on the Monday night, and there was
no notice taken of this Friday’s performance.
The strain had been so great that Carlos did not recover from
it for months.
When we had been struggling in London for a number of
years, a beautiful Hungarian girl came to Carlos as a pupil, for
he was beginning to establish himself as a fine teacher, although,
at times, he was almost too weak to go through the lessons,
looking as though he would faint.
As time went on there was a strong attraction between the
two, and, finally, a tentative betrothal.
The girl was beautiful, she had marked musical talent, her
relatives were well known in the musical world, and could have
greatly aided Carlos. They lived in a handsome house near our
humble lodgings, and the parents were willing to make their
daughter a liberal allowance on her marriage with Carlos.
As the intimacy increased he began to perceive that the family
of the young girl were taking up an antagonistic attitude towards
me. They thought me much too strict, and they almost scoffed
at religion.
320 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PALESTIN E
Carlos had been especially attacked during the months wherein
this attachment had been forming, his antipathy for me ever
increasing. On the other hand, the easy-going, well-to-do
atmosphere of the young girl’s luxurious home was a temptation
to him, contrasted to our strenuous existence.
He told me afterwards that at this period he felt that the attack
upon him, ever inciting him to hatred of me, had grown almost
unbearable; and when a means of escape was opened to him,
through which he could reap every advantage, a beautiful and
passionately loving bride, talented, well-off, and well-connected
musically, who did not require of him my strict morality—when
this tempting solution of his trouble was offered to him, it seemed
most difficult to resist.
He left London for ten days, in order to come to a decision
while alone; and he wrote from his place of retreat to the Hun­
garian girl, sending me a copy of the letter.
He said to her that he could not marry any woman who was
not faithful to me. He did not insist upon her joining the Catholic
Church, or any other Church, but he wished his children to be
brought up religiously, setting obedience to our Lord above
every other claim. It was I (Rosamond) who had waked in him,
as had no other person, the love of God; and hence his wife
must desire to be my devoted daughter, as he desired to be my
devoted son, and she must show her allegiance by adopting the
strict and strenuous life which I advised.
If she did not wish to fulfil these conditions, he did not wish
to marry her. If she was willing to accept them, he promised
to labour perseveringly until, by degrees, she left her ill-regulated
ways (such, for instance, as drinking a quantity of strong tea
at midnight, and then taking a drug in order to sleep), and he
promised to pray for patience in case she could not alter her life
at once.
It was a noble, manly letter which, I thought, ought to have
won the highest admiration from any aspiring girl, and I hoped
the Hungarian would answer in the same spirit, as she had the
making of a fine woman in her, so it seemed to me.
Instead, she went into a fit of passionate despair, until the
parents, so they said, feared suicide. Carlos received one or two
grossly insulting letters from her friends, and there was a complete
break between the two families.
He, however, was firm in his attitude. He said to me:
321
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
“ My wife must be a religious woman, and my home a religious
home ; and you, more than any human being I have known, have
founded in me this love of God. If they intend to throw you over,
and to ignore religion—an intention which has been made toler­
ably plain to me—then I have decided to stand by you, now and
always.”
The girl persisted in refusing to accept the ideals Carlos
imposed, and the conditional engagement was broken.
From this time the attack began to grow far less violent until
now, thank God, Carlos and I have lived in peace and harmony
for a number of years.
It is a victory which has been won quietly, hiddenly. Few
people knew that Carlos had this antipathy for me, paralysing
him, soul and body, and interfering with his business success
through ill health, for fifteen years ; and, hence, not many persons
realize how great is God’s triumph.
Yet is not the conquest a remarkable one, which may bring a
renewed courage to many who read this testimony?
Carlos and I are wide apart as the poles in race, creed, and
temperament. We have been tried by poverty, by long-continued
and undeserved failure, by year-long illness, by the monotony
of a tête-à-tête, unrelieved, during many months, through any
change or amusement, in the days of our solitude and poverty.
I had, in addition, the test of giving all and receiving nothing,
for when I was depriving myself of necessary food and clothing
in order to be true to my promise to Carlos, I was receiving only
blows in return. He also, luxuriously bred, and waited on at
every turn by the servants of the Consulate in his father s home,
was suddenly plunged into what seemed beggary by comparison.
And over and above these tangible trials, we were ever pursued
by a mysterious curse, harder to endure than any infliction which
could be weighed and measured.
Had not this constant hate, forced upon him from without,
gripped his vitals, Carlos, with his sane and sober life and his
naturally fine constitution, would have come to be a strong and
healthy man, for he was rapidly growing better before the attack
began. And had he been in robust health, his success as a singer
would have been assured after his first appearances, and our
trials much less.
Under these conditions we have been held together by one
x
322 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
bond, our mutual love for Jesus Christ. He, our Saviour, with the
saintly aid of the Blessed Mary, has brought us peace. Have I
not, then, the right to say that He, thus helped, can unite any two
souls if they love Him fervently enough?
For our difficulties have been enormous; and if our trial has
ended in triumph, may not all strivers win a splendid victory?
Why has God permitted us to be thus pursued? For one sole
reason, so we believe: Only thus could He teach us meekness,
only thus could He make us understand that the love and praise
lavished upon Carlos belong, not to him, but to G od; for left un­
protected, he has behaved, sometimes, like a demented creature.
And only thus could He make us understand that the love and
praise lavished upon me belong also to my Maker, for when He
permitted it, I have tasted the humiliation of being the helpless
object of a year-long hate.
It has done us both a good which cannot be measured, and we
thank Him from the depths of our hearts for the trial which has
helped to kill conceit and to teach us how to be humble. Self-
sufficiency is a folly, and any experience which stamps this fact
upon us, is a great blessing. The fifteen years of tribulation
through which we have passed have so imprinted this verity that
no after success, so we earnestly hope, will efface the blessed
lesson.
This great truth also I have learnt. Had not the Blessed Mary
filled my angular character with, at least, a faint reflection of Her
tender grace, I could never have won Carlos. Inevitably his posi­
tiveness and my positiveness would have clashed, for we are both
very hard-set people. But our mutual love for our Lady, whom afl
generations are told to call blessed, has fused our resisting angu­
larities until they have become yielding unities, our differences of
character being no longer a weakness, but a wealth.
If I have taught him to adore more fervently Jesus Christ, he
has helped me to love, more deeply and constantly, the Mother
of Christ, and my whole character has been softened and purified
by this tender passion; hence I owe to my boy a great debt of
gratitude.
Finally Carlos broke down altogether in London, after passing
successfully a difficult examination at the London University.
He had grown so emaciated and so pale that several people
TH E ROCK OF GIBRALTAR 323
said to me he looked like a dying man, and he could do almost no
work. I had gone to sleep one night offering up a deep prayer
for guidance with regard to him. I begged Christ to tell me what
I should do to save his life. I was awakened in the night, and
heard the words, “ Go to the South Coast between Worthing
and Hove ” We neither of us knew the South Coast, and had no
idea what towns were to be found between Worthing and Hove.
Also we had very little money left, hence I did not see how we
were to establish ourselves in a home in some unknown village.
However, we had been told to go and so I knew the way would
open. We engaged some cheap lodgings in Worthing through a
Teachers’ Guild List. As soon as we arrived, we visited the small
towns between Worthing and Hove, found a little unfurnished
house in Lancing, at a low rent, and in less than two weeks after
the injunction had been given, we were settled in our new home,
for I felt there was no time to spare. .
We had gathered a few furnishings in our various lodgings.
I ransacked the second-hand shops for the absolute necessaries,
and bought a tea-kettle, pot, and frying-pan, by way of a kitchen
outfit. Presently an unexpected sum came which made us more
comfortable, and we felt very sumptuous when we could afford
to buy sheets, pillows, and pillow-cases, instead of being rolled
up in our travelling-rugs. ,
I prayed to be made a good cook, seeing that our food must be
of the simplest; and, very soon, I learnt to prepare delectable
potatoes, beans, onions, and cabbage. A few villagers who came
to see us asked me where I had learnt to cook so well, and I told
them that God who had made the vegetables had taught me how
to prepare them, so that I should not spoil His gifts to us.
IP
t was in this little home that I learnt how great is His Power
when one is tired to the point of exhaustion. The work would
have been beyond my strength, in any event but it was made
the harder because there was no gas, the water had to be pumpe >
and there were none of the work-saving appliances found in
larftere°(Srlos rallied, and as his health returned he regained his
voice. Presently he began to sing in churches, religious meetings
Ind concerts in the surrounding towns. He is now honoured
and beloved by many who have heard him, numerous messages
reaching us which reiterate that never has the writer listened to
religious singing so deeply touching.
M Y PERILO US L IF E IN PALESTIN E

At this time he was led to devote himself more and more to
the study of languages, feeling that in some unforeseen way
they would enhance his future usefulness. We did not return to
London, therefore, as this was a better place for study, but in
this narrow sphere, although the greater part of his time is given
to languages, he may still be an apostle through music, for our
friends tell us that often on joining a group of men the topic
discussed is the “ Signor’s” singing, as he is called, and wherever
his black curly head appears on a platform a warm welcome greets
him. His subtle artistry and simple sincerity appeal to the most
cultivated as to the humblest listeners. Often, as I sit in the
audiences, I hear some distinguished-looking man or woman
say, “ That is masterly.”
A few days ago I called on a leading official in a responsible
position in Worthing, to which town we have now moved, in
order to obtain a signature to a paper. He said, “ I have a deep
affection, I had almost said a passion, for this young man, and I
think the whole town prays with me that his most useful life
may be preserved. We all love him and his pure art.”
I was astonished to hear so warm an expression of affection
from so reticent and dignified a man, and I was fully repaid for
our long years of misery. Our Lord has conquered and Satan is
vanquished.
Although the relief from poverty came many years after the
time of which I have been writing, may I say, ere finishing this
period of my life, that we were set at ease, finally, in a most
unexpected way.
Murray’s father was kind and generous enough to give me a
modest competency, although he still believed me to be in error.
Many times have I sent to him messages of warm gratitude for
the relief he afforded me.
We did not change our simple mode of life, continuing the
two-meal system and adding very little to our bill of fare. But
our existence was made easier, and above all I could give aid and
pleasure to those around me.
As the years rolled by Carlos proved, more and more clearly,
that a man can live a perfectly pure life and yet do highly success­
ful work; for in addition to the B.A. Honours of the French-
Oriental University, which stands to his credit, he has become the
Laureate of the Royal Conservatoire of Naples and an M.A. of
TH E RO CK OF GIBRA LTA R 325
the University of London. He has now mastered, besides Latm,
Greek, and Provençal, fifteen modern languages ; the grammar
of each of these he knows well, and speaks a number of them
with fluent ease. He now awaits God’s leading as to how he can
best devote this knowledge of languages to His Service.
In addition, he has thoroughly learnt not only the practice,
but also the theory of music, and gives promise, through such
work as he has found time to do in the midst of his studying and
teaching, of being a composer above the average his music
having a distinctly individual charm, being both melodious and
Clain spite of the great amount of work he has done begun each
morning at six o’clock, he is now in far better health than whe

through vicissitudes lasting during long and monotonous years,

overcome, through our Lord and Lady, there is not a man or
woman, reading this book, who is not able to win the same
victory, no matter how difficult their fate may seem to be.
All of us are still very far from the goal, nevertheless a certain
advance may be made.
And how simple is the change from irreligion to religion, a
simplicity unrecognized because of our senseless controversies
over slightly differing creeds and ceremonies.
The irreligious man or woman is self-centred, each depending
on his or her own masculine or feminine powers.
The religious man or woman is God-centred, each depend­

to maintain themselves ? Or those who throw themselves without
reserve on the Mercy of the Father-Mother, who have created a
Cosmos safely poised in mid-space, and hence may certainly

soul?
We learnt, then, in our humble little home, not only spiritual
but also practical lessons, which would go far, in this age of
unrest, to bring the world back to sanity:
We met our difficulties as manual labourers, who were underfed
and overworked, not by a strike either against man or God,
but by cooking our simple food so well that it satisfied us,
and by praying to our Creator for fresh power when our
own limited strength, unaccustomed to rough work, had quite
failed.
Where our poverty was caused by the injustice and the robbery
of our fellow-creatures, we commended our affairs into His
Hands, and patiently waited until, in due time, He would solve
our difficulties in unforeseen ways, ever showing us how to use
the wisest means to ensure the best end.
We have discovered, therefore, in our homely little cottage,
that no human being can win a real independence save through
Him, for it is certain that no human being is free from pains
and penalties; these overtake us all, prince and peasant alike.
Hence there is no means of escape, save to glorify pains and
penalties by rising the more exultingly the deeper one is thrust
down.

Again and again and yet again, we failed to seize hold ofThis-
truth; slowly did we grope our dim way, but when our faith
did not fail, we came to realize in rare and precious moments
that He could refreshingly uplift His children even when they
were fainting from fatigue. I wonder if the angels themselves
are not tempted, sometimes, to grow impatient at our continued
blindness, which refuses to see that all Heaven is waiting to help
us, that an infinite Power surrounds and infills us, now and always.
Later Carlos went to Washington, U.S.A., having been engaged
as linguist by the League of Nations to serve in the International
Labour Conference composed of Government delegates, em­
ployers, and working men: and convened to examine the needs
of Labour, all over the world, from the humanitarian, the moral,
and the scientific standpoints. It is said of this Conference, where
forty-one Nations are represented, that it is “ the first of its kind
in history.” He writes to me: “ It is impossible to tell you how
grateful I am to you for having taught me the principles whic
are now successfully guiding my life.” And again: I send you
the most intense expression of gratitude for what you have done
for me in forming my character, your example helping me to
fulfil my mission happily, successfully, and in harmony with my
fellow-workers.” He adds: “ The more I see of the world, the
more closely do I desire to cling to my principles of prayer and
faithfulness to God, ever remembering, as an encouragement, our
gay, straightforward, simple home.”
These words are as balm to my soul, for it seemed impo ,
during the long years of his mysterious antipathy for me, tha
they could ever be uttered. I rejoice exceedingly, because they
denote that the triumph of Christ over evil, manifested m ataos
every form of temptation, is now complete; Carlos prayer is
answered, for, leaving his sheltered home-fife, he has entered
the world, and is not possessed by it. He has encountered t e
usual jealousies and contrarieties without being angered or

33° M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PALESTIN E
In analysing the lesson of our war-martyred century, the
plain answer known to us all may be simply put, and as there is
still threat of war in the air, should be deeply engraved on our
memories:
Awful butchery; heart-breaking bereavement; nerve-racking
dread of news yet more terrible; the cruel strain of overwork;
pinched poverty, fainting with hunger; the destruction of thou­
sands of hardly earned homes, of precious art-treasures, of price­
less libraries, of beloved sanctuaries, built through inspired years
of effort; disorganized industries, entailing burdening loads of
daily care on business men; the strain of living, with soaring
prices, on limited incomes; the ceaseless anxieties of heavily
burdened statesmen and warriors; the distress of districts which
have suffered under army occupation and the aircraft menace;
dangerous seafaring; the strife-engendering friction lurking
in international trade difficulties; huge national debts; the spread
of loathsome diseases; and, heaviest of all, the long years wherein
the after-burdens must be carried by the lame and the halt and
the blind, until death brings relief—the whole of the penalties
brought on by this world-war, through which we have passed,
from which we still suffer, and from which, alas, we may again
suffer, penalties which no words may describe—all this dread
misery crowded into haunted years, and followed by a so-called
peace, straining men’s endurance, could have been avoided if
one short word had been engraved on the hearts of men through­
out the world, one word of four letters: L o ve.
Is it not fitting, then, in the face of this fact, to put in the fore­
front, from this hour forward, not learning, not science, not
mechanical ingenuity, not trade supremacy, not military prowess,
not statecraft—none of the ordinary aims and ambitions of men,
for have not all these been satanically used, often, in these dread
years of war?
Unless, then, we supremely exalt Love, letting all other usefully
honourable aims take a secondary place, where shall we turn,
where find safety, when praiseworthy human ingenuity, most
cleverly inventive, has been and may again be used satanically?
What is the mightiest form of Love? Shall we set on the highest
altar faithful parental love; the reverent love of children for
their elders; loyal brother and sister love; gentle sympathy
between true friends? Do these calmly sweet affections sweep the
ARM AGEDDO N 33*

in all creativeness. For how else can Life be lastingly cleansed
save by cleansing its Source ?
If, through the colossal sacrifice of the young lives which have
been offered up through cruel war, this conviction is stamped
upon us, then we may hope for an unbroken peace. But if an
unholy generation, turning a Sacrament into an appetite, still
continues to breed savagery, what certain hope have we that

SUCCESS
T h e V o i c e a n d i t s P r o p h e t i c P r o m i s e .
The reader knows how I have toiled and suffered in Palestine;
he or she knows that I have bought the right to be the owner
of Armageddon with my heart’s blood, for my
died in the earlier and useless effort to get possessio
prophetic spot, delayed through the=trickeries o f^^Ju rh sh
Government in conjunction with Mustafa s laxi y ,
remembers that I myself was under fear of assassmation or many
months, when Mustafa, mad with absinthe,
to kill me, and did end, at last, as a murderer. The ^ is awa
that withthe exceptionof the three minutes whenI threwmyselt
dead with fatigue, on the sofa, after Murray and myself had been
watching a dfngerously delirious Mustafa for three days and
nights—with the exception of these three minutes, when I knew
I ought to be up and doing, I have neglected n° dut\ elfhe
moral or legal, in connection with Armageddon. N'vertheles5
in the vears 1925-6 my prospects stiff remained hopeless, ror
he outlook was’ so d a ^ J t not an « * * * » * “ ^ « *
»rauaintance thought I had the remotest chance o f success.
The fellaheen had sworn on oath that I had never
foot of land in the Plain of Armageddon, and swore this oat
with the deeds to the land made out in my “ * e
tablebefore them, deeds registered m ,perfect^
Governm ent books, and in spite o f the fact that they rtiemswv
had rented the land from me for one year (the rent being p
„ turmlph the British Vice-Consul) at a sufficiently late date
to forbid any claimthroughprescription, andthat they tb^ se ^
had requested the sale, being in need of money at that time
rather than of the land, of which they had extensive areas.
Under these circumstances the Palestine Government reiterated
their S i s a l to protect me, Z
that as the Turkish Government had failed in the Contract 1
G ^ r n m e n t had made with me, after selling me the land a
S r o n a Contract to deliver it to me adm inistratively-under
S Srcumstances it was generally thought that the duty of
336 M Y PERILO US L IF E IN PALESTIN E
the present Government, as the successors of the former
Government, was to carry out this Contract by putting me in
possession.
Instead, I was told to go to law with these perjured fellaheen
in a prejudiced inland Mohammedan town, with an Arab judge
as associate, and all experienced men told me that, unprotected
by the Government, there would be endless procrastination and
constant intrigues in bringing this suit against some ninety
lying fellaheen, and hence that the attempt to get possession of
my land was, under these circumstances, a hopeless task. Nothing
was left to us, therefore, save to return to England completely
beaten.
Thus balked at all points, I struggled to bear cheerfully not
only the business disappointment and the anxiety about money
it entailed, but also to overcome an even greater trial, for it was
very difficult to reason away a tormenting doubt: why had the
Voice led me to persevere, again and again, if this was to be the
result? As my hopes had risen so high after General Allenby’s
victory, the disappointment was doubly hard to bear.
All who knew the case were as puzzled as I was myself at the
refusal of the present Government to carry through the obliga­
tion incumbent on the late Turkish Government, a failure which
had caused all my trouble.
As I had reached eighty years of age, my people begged me
to let Carlos accompany me, hence we were obliged, in order
to save money, to live most economically, having few comforts;
and in addition I had suffered compulsory vaccination on landing
in Palestine, and the consequences had been serious; my usually
sound lungs were attacked, and I had no rest day or night, as
I coughed incessantly and violently for weeks. Hence I was worn
out, and under these accumulated trials it was difficult to obey
the Voice ever bidding me to believe that His was the Kingdom
and the Power and the Glory and to remember that in this know­
ledge must I constantly rejoice, no matter what trials I had to
bear.
We struggled to obey with a certain measure of success, and
made ready to start on our homeward journey upheld by an
unquestioning faith. Christ had permitted these trials, hence they
must be gladly borne, so we knew. Always the Voice repeated,
“ Do not complain, do not be sorry for yourself.” So I sought
SUCCESS 337
to spread my wings, refusing to be heavy-footed, and it was
not always an easy task, for the suffering had now lasted so long.
At this juncture both Carlos and myself were strongly led to
return via Constantinople instead of through Alexandria as was
my custom.
This proved to be something of a task, for everything had been
left to the last moment, in spite of our efforts to expedite matters.
All the passport formalities, etc., were delayed, and we found,
at the last moment, that we must get a special permit to go to
Beyrouth, from whence our boat started for Constantinople.
We went to the Consul to get the necessary permission, but
a formidable kavass barred the way.
“ Madam, His Excellency sleeps,” he said.
“ But,” I explained, “ our boat leaves early to-morrow morning
from Beyrouth; our passages are taken and paid for; we must
start at once.”
‘Madam, His Excellency sleeps,” was the sole and stolidly
repeated answer we could extort from the kavass.
When His Excellency finally finished his nap, he proved to be
a most courteous gentleman, who would have forgone, in all
probability, his long sleep had he known of our plight; but as
it was, we could not begin our long journey by automobile
overland to Beyrouth until after five o’clock in the evening,
having been delayed all day by these formalities, of a rather
exasperating character, as many travellers know.
When we reached Sidon it was quite dark. Our chauffeur, half
Arab, half Turk, had followed us into the Bank at Haifa and
had seen me receive the money for the journey, which I could
obtain only at the last moment, after much difficulty, owing to
legal hindrances, and hence was obliged to carry on my person.
As I turned and saw him looking over my shoulder, the gleam
in his covetous eyes rather disturbed me, as we had a long and
lonely ride before us, where we would be at the mercy of this
powerful young giant.
At Sidon the chauffeur disappeared for some time, and ten
minutes out of Sidon we were suddenly stopped and the auto,
was surrounded by a number of men.
I could not at once distinguish who they were in the dark,
and feared they were confederates of the chauffeur, but we soon
perceived that it was a squad of French soldiers who barred the
Y
338 M Y PERILO US LIF E IN PALESTIN E
way. To our dismay they ordered us back to Haifa, as four
chauffeurs had been killed on this road during the week by the
Druses lying in ambush.
Without warning to the soldiers or to ourselves, our chauffeur
put on full speed, scattered the soldiers right and left, and we
started to Beyrouth on our perilous way at a pace we had never
before experienced. With lights turned off we raced along the
tortuous road, where we might have been pitched over an
embankment at any moment, in the dense darkness.
There must be an elemental savage lurking somewhere in
our civilized souls, for finding ourselves in this predicament we
gave ourselves up to the joy of this mad race. We scarcely
seemed to touch the ground, as the chauffeur whirled us through
the darkness, urged by the knowledge that his life and ours were
at stake. But the Turk in him evidently enjoyed the danger, and
there appeared to be something of the Turk remaining in our­
selves, for we also were thrilled, as we seemed to be sweeping
like a bird through the air, instead of travelling soberly on
terra firma.
But I must say, although it was an exhilarating ride, that we
were relieved when the friendly lights of Beyrouth came in sight
and we drove to our hotel in safety.
The staff of the hotel was amazed when they heard we had
traversed this deserted road without being murdered, as no one
else had dared to do so at night, ours being a unique experience.
His Excellency’s nap and the other tedious formalities and
Oriental delays might have cost us our lives, but happily no harm
befell us.
We embarked early the next morning, reached Constantinople
without further accident, and there a complete volte-face in our
affairs filled us with deep gratitude.
In one short day, God’s time having come, we accomplished
more than I had been able to do in the barren years ranging from
1889 to 1926-7.
We had been led to telegraph to the British Consulate-General
that we should lie in port during thirty-six hours. A messenger
came on board as soon as we reached Constantinople, making
an appointment at the Consulate for the next morning. We called
at the appointed time, and there we met the British Secretary
of a Supreme Arbitral Tribunal which was to be convened
SUCCESS 339
for the purpose of settling outstanding questions between
British nationals (which I was by marriage) and the Turkish
Government. The Secretary insisted on my seeing the leading
English lawyer in Constantinople, and to my surprise and delight
I found that he, Mr. Henry E. Pears, and his father before him,
Sir Edwin Pears, had known Mr. Oliphant well, and I found
him to be a most courteous gentleman, willing to help me to
the best of his distinguished ability, out of friendship for my
husband.
It transpired that through the Treaty of Lausanne, I was
given a good chance of success, under various Articles bearing
on transactions before the war.
Article 73 states that “ contracts, whatever may be their
purpose concluded between individuals or Companies and the
State (Turkish) provinces, municipalities, or other similar
juridical persons charged with administrative functions, remain
in force.”
Article 79 states, “ All periods whatever of prescription, or
limitation of right of action, whether they began to run before
or after the outbreak of war, shall be treated, in the territory of
the High Contracting Parties, so far as regards relations between
enemies, as having been suspended from the 29th October, 1914,
until the expiration of three months after the coming into force
of the present Treaty” (signed at Lausanne on the 24th July, 1923).
Mr. Pears advised me to prepare a Memorial to be presented
to the Supreme Arbitral Tribunal, which he, with the aid of an
expert Turkish scholar and lawyer, undertook to present to that
Tribunal, a Memorial founded on the above and other favourable
Articles, which these two experts thought defended my claim
very satisfactorily.
So I suddenly found that, instead of having to wrestle in an
inland Mohammedan town with a crowd of perjured fellaheen
in a hopeless struggle, I was to be represented by a noted expert
in Anglo-Turkish affairs and his very capable assistant lawyer
before a dignified Tribunal in Constantinople, pledged to
administer, as a supreme and decisive Authority, the questions
brought before it. In addition, not only did the Treaty of Lau­
sanne, and other first-hand information known to Mr. Pears
concerning Oriental affairs, greatly assist me with regard to
Armageddon, but this information, including details about what
J
/
340 M Y PERILO US LIFE IN PA LESTIN E
is known as a wakf, removed serious stumbling-blocks with
regard to claims connected with my Haifa affairs.
There could scarcely have been a greater change in my fate,
and I now await my turn in the long list of claims brought before
the Tribunal with a hopeful patience.
The question is not yet settled, but even a pessimist—and I
am an optimist— even a pessimist would be persuaded, I think,
that success is clearly in sight, and hence my wonderful Voice
was correct when it bade me “ Persevere,” in spite of the universal
opinion that it was impossible for me to succeed at Armageddon,
an opinion which, humanly speaking, was quite warranted, for
no one could foresee that the Treaty of Lausanne would come
to my rescue, through men of whom I had never heard, until
the Voice urged us to go, at some peril, to Constantinople, in
order to find these good and able unknown friends.
The strong probability is, therefore, that I shall come into
possession of Armageddon through the supreme authority of
an Anglo-Turkish Arbitral Tribunal, so my learned advisers
confidently believe.
I am thankful that when there seemed to be not a glimmer of
hope, our faith, through the help of our Lord, remained steadfast,
and also most thankful that we were not murdered in our perilous
journey from Haifa to Beyrouth, just as the dawn of a new day
of hope illumined the dark impasse, where there seemed to be no
exit.
We returned to Palestine, Carlos and I, in the same year,
1926-7, and here the same good fortune blessed us, a good
fortune he well merited, for he had helped me with an unfail­
ing courtesy and capacity, the eighteen languages he had now
studied serving us well. As we journeyed through various lands
he was taken to be an Arab, a Turk, a Greek, an Italian, a French­
man, and even a Scotchman, by a Scotchman, each country think­
ing him to be a native, which much facilitated our business,
but no one mistakes him for an Englishman, although he has
thoroughly mastered our difficult tongue.
With this new outlook in my affairs, two of the ablest lawyers
in Palestine, after I had answered a long and searching question­
naire, undertook to defend me in my Haifa claim to some valuable
land in the Haifa Station, the Station of the Palestinian Railway,
which the labour and the money of my husband had initiated.
SUCCESS 34i
And again reverence for Mr. Oliphant aided me, for these two
very able lawyers held him in high esteem and desired to help his
widow. It was a Crown Case, and even the Attorney for the
Government opened the suit by courteously expressing regret
that his position obliged him to go against the widow of a man
so highly revered as was Laurence Oliphant in Palestine.
I was deeply grateful for all this kindness, but a very serious
stumbling-block remained, namely the lack of money. How was
I to pay the expenses connected with the law?
God, who had opened the way so far, not by chance but by
direct leading, again removed this hindrance which quite barred
further progress, so it seemed.
AN U N EXPECTED R E L IE F
I h a d been struggling with an Arab agent in charge of my
property on Mount Carmel, inherited from Laurence, which I had
tried for years to sell when in need of money, but with no buyers,
as this agent balked any sale, and also because it was rather
far away on the mountain. This agent managed finally to seques­
trate this property, thus barring the way to raising on it the
money I required, and I seemed again to be baffled, for it is cer­
tain that without money one cannot carry on lawsuits. One day,
as I sat pondering over the matter, a vision was vouchsafed to
me: I saw myself struggling in a confused chaos of darkly
shifting masses, surrounded by black clouds gathering over this
property, namely Dalieh-el-Carmel.
These masses typified, so I realized, the endless intrigues which
had balked me for years, and were still being repeated by my
tricky agent, a clever lawyer, seeking to possess Dalieh which,
so I had been warned, he was intending to do, having laid all
his plans.
I then saw, prophetically, a solution. I perceived a most
powerful arm and hand holding a sword which cut straight
through the writhing dark mass of intrigues I had seen in my
vision with one powerful blow, and then a small crown was
held out to me.
This prophetic vision of a new dispensation at Haifa was
fulfilled almost immediately, for a day or two later we won the
lawsuit the violent Arab had brought against me in order to take
from me my property; and as I left the Court I was deeply touched
by the greetings from all sides; Germans, Arabs, Dalieh Druses,
joining in the warm congratulations, the Orientals salaaming
and kissing my hand with genuine good feeling.
Throughout this trial a faithful friend of mine, Miss Frances
E. Newton, had stood by me loyally. She offered to buy the
property and engaged a well-known English lawyer to defend
m e; he succeeded both in the first suit and the appeal, in com­
pletely freeing me from any claim on the part of the Arab, who
had vowed to persecute me to the extent of his ability. But his
threats were brought to naught, although the questions raised

were somewhat involved, turning, to a considerable extent, on
prescription (occupancy), and here again the Treaty of Lausanne
came to my rescue.
Few friends would have shown the persevering patience
under difficulties shown by Miss Newton. She is now the owner
of the property, and, after much trouble, is in possession of the
home which she intends to dedicate, through some good work,
to the memory of my dear Laurence.
It was here he lived during some of the happiest hours of his
life with his beloved Alice, and here she died, leaving him
desolate. It was in this home also that I suffered the dread blow
of Murray’s loss, so it is a fitting thing that Dalieh should be
sacred to Laurence’s memory, for everywhere I find that his name
is beloved and revered in Palestine.
It is the sale of this home, bought for this gracious purpose,
that has opened the way for me to obtain justice, for the purchase
money paid me by Miss Newton has now furnished the sum
of which I was in need.
So the strong sword has cleft through serious hindrances,
enabling me to persevere to the end, through God’s Grace.
The Prophecy is being fulfilled therefore, both spiritually and
materially, unless incredible difficulties pursue me, ordaining
that I shall leave Palestine through a narrow exit, but with an
ever-burning lamp in my hand.
Yet so strong is He in the heart which adores Him, that even
were all things to fail, still may one rise as a giant refreshed.
It is unspeakably splendid, this courage which may uplift a
Christian, and I pray that all living creatures may own it, in the
end, for it is the greatest Gift which life holds.
Shall the other portion of this Prophecy be fulfilled? Shall the
Israel, which I saw mounted on a masterfully powerful white
horse with his heir in his arms, long before the Jews came to
their Home in Palestine—shall this People, whose year-long prayer
God has answered, ride through the dark and narrow valley as
a blessed Peace-Maker?
TH E MOUNT OF O LIVES AN D ARTHUR JAM ES
BALFO UR
“ A t that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all
the nations shall be gathered unto it ” (Jer. iii. 17).
Happily, in ending this book, I may give my testimony that the
possibility of securing a consensus among His children, which
loses nothing through strife, was manifested on Mount Scopus,
a hill belonging to the revered range of hills which includes the
Mount of Olives. Dimly and only for one short hour, it is true,
was it blessedly in evidence; nevertheless the multitude which
was drawn to Jerusalem, and climbed this sacred eminence to
listen to Arthur James Balfour, will not easily forget that prophetic
hour.
On this hallowed spot was gathered a vast audience of many
creeds and nationalities, an audience filling not only the amphi­
theatre fashioned out of the rock around the platform, but
extending in picturesque groups over the hill-side.
This difficult audience, some members of which were, at first,
distinctly hostile, Lord Balfour, at his advanced age, had the
courage to address. He stood a tall, red-robed figure outlined
against a historic background, for in the distance the Jordan,
issuing from a ribbon of green, loses itself in the blue waters of
the Dead Sea. There was no sign of age in his upright form,
and none in the voice ringing over that great assembly, stronger
than the voice of any younger speaker, and reaching, evidently,
the last eagerly intent person on the hill-side, the restless com­
pany being stilled in a rapt attention.
When the failing flesh of old age is thus renewed, we need
look to no mortal cause, for mortality is in the grip of an enslaving
decrepitude, ever slowly tightening its relentless hold. From
whence, then, came this strength ? Assuredly not from the weaken­
ing human frame, but only from the God-lent Spirit, immortal
in its Power, and that Spirit was radiated through this age-weary
instrument to uplift the whole of that vast audience.
It was not the words which carried conviction to this mass of
humanity, as multiform as an audience could well be, for many

did not understand the words, but the potent factor was the
personality of Lord Balfour, unhindering in its humility, which
was used as a transmitting medium to give a fresh impetus to his
fellow-creatures, on this sacred spot.
My near neighbours were a German, a Czecho-Slovakian,
a Spaniard, and four Arab Sheikhs. I had watched the latter with
some anxiety, fearing that they might be intent on doing Lord
Balfour a harm, as he was a ready target in his exposed position.
But when I saw that even these stolid, and at first mutinous,
faces were kindled as they watched him with reverent, uplifted
eyes, my fears vanished, and in almost similar words the English-
speaking German, Czecho-Slovakian, and Spaniard near me
exclaimed, at the end of the address, This man is not a poli­
tician, but he is a prophet?”
No aged man can upraise a great company through his own
failing strength; hence, it was God’s enduring Power which was
prophetically radiated through a worthy human instrument to
remind us that a magnificent Unity is possible, splendidly able
to gather all mankind. No matter how antagonistic, how varied
in creed, how wide-sundered in nationality its members may be,
yet its millions may still remain fitted to achieve a Solidarity able
to merge all creatures in an allied aim, the aim of building the
supreme Kingdom of Christ. That Kingdom shall rob no lesser
Sovereignties of their precious, because hardly earned, indi­
vidualities, as each may be kept sacredly intact, even as the radii
of a circle may be conserved while converging, wheel-like, to
an all-including Centre, as an Axis.
Standing as the central and yet meek figure of that widely
varied throng, drawing all sympathies to himself, Arthur Balfour
made manifest this Truth. For this vast assembly, representing
many creeds and many nations, which had come to hear him,
recognized in him, not a politician on a rostrum, but a prophet
on the Mount of Olives, and thus touched, remained to pray
where some of them had come to scoff and to rebel.
It is true that the Nations were gathered harmoniously together
at Jerusalem for only one short hour on this sacred spot; it is
further true, alas, that at Damascus a satanic fury sought to end
Lord Balfour’s Mission on this earth. Nevertheless, faintly heard
as the promise still is, may not this foreshadowing moment
persuade us that in the end there shall be a universal Peace on
earth, sacrificing no precious individual heritage, and yet gather-

ing all men to adore God in unison, a verity prophetically revealed
to many of us in that memorable meeting, where complexity
spelt not dissonance but harmony, though each note therein
retained, unmerged, its own true vibration. This was the lesson
we learnt at Jerusalem.
The next day, forgetting the thunders of the ovations greeting
him, Lord Balfour received callers, among them myself, and
listened with the most careful and simply sympathetic patience
to the recital of our small individual difficulties, weary and
constantly occupied as he must have been through the ceaseless
public efforts he was called on to make.
One such experience suffices—the patient reader who has
followed me so far will agree, I am sure—one such experience
suffices to renew our faith in the latent Divinity of humanity.
What need we accept in order to believe that in the end
humanity may achieve this Divinity?
The symbolic colour, white, contains all radiant colour; and
a spirit-pure love, contains all richest life. When leaving our
vulgarities for ever behind us, we learn this Truth, then may we
see our all-comprehending God face to face and sterile monotonies
can never again be suffered.
In that hour pure women, Madonna-like, and virile men,
Christ-like, each sex strongly tempted, the one by vanity the
other by appetite, may ensure, at the last, the certain fall of Baby­
lon, and so secure a conquest as certain through the triumphantly
won Purity-Battle of Armageddon.

B y ED W YN BE VAN
La. Cr. 8VO
. Author of “ Hellenism and Christianity” 7s. 6d.
This volume embodies six lectures given in 1927 at Oxford on the
Speaker’s foundation. Taking it as a belief, persistent from primitive times
till to-day, that the spiritual causation which we know in living men is
part of a spirit-world extending far beyond the world we see, Mr. Bevan
surveys some of the ways by which it was believed in antiquity that
knowledge of the spirit-world, or communications from the spirit-world,
might be obtained. There was, first, the belief that denizens ol this world
might visit the spirit-world and return to report, then the belief that
denizens of that world might visit this (epiphanies of gods and appear­
ances of ghosts); yet again, the idea of the voice from heaven, the idea of the
letter from heaven ; and, finally, inspiration in its two forms of Sibylline
ecstasy and of dream-vision. It is shown how some of the ancient theories
of inspiration were carried on with modifications in the Christian Church.
Methods and Uses of Hypnosis and
Self-Hypnosis
B y BERN ARD H O LLAN D ER, M.D.
Cr. 8p0. 6s.
Dr. Hollander's new book is the result of thirty years’ experience of
experimental hypnosis and hypnotic treatment. He shows that it is not
sleep which is needed for hypnosis, but a peculiar state of self-abstraction
in which the senses become curiously exalted and acute, a state induced
by bringing into prominence the sub-conscious mind. In this state the
mind will perform amazing feats, and spontaneous and lasting cures may
be effected. Detailed and authenticated evidence is given of these and
other phenomena, a study of which does much to elucidate the mysteries
of Thought-transference, Clairvoyance, Premonitions, etc. The book
will interest medical and psychological experts, while in style and
language the general reader has been considered.

The Case for Christianity
By C LE M EN T F. ROGERS
Demy 8vo. \2s.6d.
This book is the outcome of twelve years of lecturing and personal
discussions on Christianity. The author begins with moral and social
questions which divide Christians from non-Christians. Then he examines
the claims of Christianity to have been on the right side in the past. The
third chapter deals with the historical foundations of the Church, and
the fourth with the central Figure of the Gospels. The second half of
the book goes on to consider Christian Theology and Philosophy in
questions connected with the Arguments for Theism based on Causation,
from Design, from Conscience, and with the practical consequences of
Christian Theism. An appendix gives some studies and criticisms of
popular Rationalistic and anti-Christian propaganda.
Moslem Mentality
A Discussion of the Presentation of Christianity to Moslems
Br L. LEVONIAN, B.A.
Cr. 8vo.
This book is an independent study. The author has not merely gone
to the works of European and American scholars. He has read the
original Islamic sources and is well acquainted with the literature and
history of Islam. An Armenian Christian, well read in Turkish, Arabic,
and Persian literature, he has had exceptional opportunities for studying
the problem on which he writes. He was born in the Near East; he
served as Professor of Turkish Literature for fourteen years m one of t e
Colleges in Asia Minor ; he has taught in a Moslem Government High
School where all the other tutors and pupils were Moslems, and he has
been in close contact throughout with the indigenous Christians, me
Moslems, and the missionary organizations. So the book is the outcome
of personal experience and observation. The chapters on the -
Moslem Mentality are packed with material drawn from present- ay
Turkish writers which is otherwise inaccessible to Western reaaer .
No one who is interested in the problems raised by the clash or
Christianity and Islam in the Near East can afford to overlook this boo .

This book of essays from the pen of one of the most distinguished Old

study of the literature of the Old Testament, and opens up avenues for
further study on lines in which Professor Gunkel has been a pioneer. Jt
demonstrates in detail the light that is shed on the meaning of the Old

A Liturgical Study of the Psalter
By R ev. C. C. K E E T , B.A., B.D., Ph.D.
Demy 8vo. About 10s. 6d.
At the present time the most important field of study in the Old Testa­
ment is the Psalter. The special studies of the Danish scholar Mowinckel
and the great commentary of Gunkel mark an important phase of critical
development. Dr. Keet in this volume has produced a study of the
Psalter which takes full account of recent work. He illustrates especially
from the liturgical point of view the milieu in which the psalms grew up.
Much interesting material dealing with the Temple-choirs and the place
of the psalms in the ancient synagogue is set forth in attractive form.
The whole treatment is clear, free from technicalities, fresh and inter­
esting. Readers who make acquaintance with this study will find that it
provides a new and illuminating background to familiar and much loved
literature.

The Warfare of Reconciliation
By JO H N S. H O YLA N D , M.A., F.R.H ist.S.
Author of “ Faith and History,” etc.
Cr. 8po. About 51.
This book deals first with the various elements of division and hatred
which endanger modern civilization, and urges the necessity for a new
impulse of reconciliation if mankind is to be saved from self-destruc­
tion. Attention is then paid to the fact that, in the past, movements for
reconciliation have succeeded on a very important scale, and therefore
there is hope that the same may take place again. In this connection
emphasis is laid upon the need for a fresh realization both of the circum­
stances of Christ's life and of the spirit of reconciliation for which He
stands. Next, the various aspects of the modern warfare'of reconciliation
are considered from the point of view of the believer in Christ who
recognizes the vastness of the problems involved and the necessity for a
new way of life in order that those problems may be solved. The book
concludes with certain general observations concerning the spirit and
manner of the modern warfare of reconciliation.

This book consists of a number of papers written by bishops and

comprehensive account of the missionary activities of the Anglican
Church. One fact clearly emerges from the book, and that is that the
Anglican Church is not, as is sometimes supposed, exclusively concerned
with the English-speaking white races, but that it is adaptable to men and
women of every race and colour.

These six Lectures of Dr. Gore’s set out four main propositions—that
the present state of society demands a reform so thorough as to amount
to a peaceful revolution ; that the revolution must consist of a change of
spirit rather than a change in legislative administration ; that the
change in spirit will not come from any conversion of men in masses,
but from the influence and inspiration of leaders ; and finally that Jesus
Christ is the Saviour and Redeemer of man in social as well as individual
life.
