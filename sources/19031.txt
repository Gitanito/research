so why don&#39;t we close our eyes
all of us together
and take some deep breaths in and out
with our nose and our mouth
breathing in with our nose and out with
our mouth
creating a circuit of energy
as you breathe in with your nose deeply
see your mind and your body filled with
light
and energy
and as you exhale see all of your
stress intentions and limitations
purified in the air of mother earth
and with each inward breath you become
more filled with light and energy
and peace and with each exhalation
you become more calm and centered
peaceful
and as you do this for a few moments
very gently become aware
that you are awake it&#39;s very
easy it&#39;s not complicated
become aware of the light of
consciousness
whereby you&#39;re hearing my voice
watching your breath
hearing the sounds around you
being aware of your body
and just gently become more aware
of the awake mind within
and sense that you were conscious
and now become aware that that conscious
mind
is illuminating your individual self
similar to a huge cathedral&#39;s windows
each unique being illuminated by the
same sun
the same light
and yet the light within your own self
is the light from the central sun
of the cosmic being of the unbounded
mind
and it is infinite
and as you look at your own conscious
mind
accept the window of your own self
completely just as you are you don&#39;t
need to change
all you have to do is be
and realize that each of us
are unique creations
and yet we have our being by virtue of
the same
light of conscious mind
and it is infinite
it is eternal
it is boundless
and lab become aware
as you take a deep breath in and out
that this conscious mind
is like a vast infinite ocean
of awareness
and the opening within your own self
is clear to that vast and infinite mind
and so you dive now more deeply
quietly into that pure ocean
of conscious being pure
consciousness
and you feel free
boundless floating
in peace
and now settle more deeply
into that quiet ocean of self
the great being standing
shining within each of us
all the time it is present
we are always one
and now become aware that each
individual
and all that exists in creation
are like ripples and waves that rise and
fall
on the surface of this infinite ocean
and yet those wave forms
of our own individuality are the ocean
we are that being
and thus we are all connected to each
other
and to all points in space and time
and all worlds and all dimensions
material and astral
and spiritual
and so as we go into this meditation
we become aware that everyone around us
have this spark of light this conscious
mind within
and in this singularity it&#39;s not
divisible
although we choose through ourselves to
divide ourselves
apart but now we choose
to become one
and we see we are all one being
shining within all things
and this is our true self the aspect of
our self
that is infinite beyond the limits of
space
and eternal because it is beyond
the limits of time
and being thus aware
we can effortlessly gaze with the eye of
oneness
this pure quiet mind
and we may look above us
in the sky
and as we rise upward with our
consciousness we can gaze
around the city or the countryside
wherever we are
effortlessly repeat the gaze
and see that the conscious mind
is omnipresent because it is everywhere
no place is barred from your vision
and wheresoever you choose to see
you can see
knowing this let us rise upward
and gaze upon the beauty of mother earth
and we become aware that the mother
earth herself
is awake and is female
but is also conscious
is not human but she is awake
she is sentient and so we feel the
oneness
as children of the earth all together
with her
and we become one with mother earth
and with one another as her children
and now we rise upward into father&#39;s sky
and the vastness of space
and in father sky we behold the same
clear consciousness an infinite
field of awareness the same awareness
whereby you are conscious at this
instant
and effortlessly on the wings of this
unbounded being
you rise upward into space
and gaze about the cosmos
and you behold that the entirety
of the cosmos is a conscious
being resonating
phasing as energy and matter
a space time
and yet in reality it is within us
it is infinite within infinity
and so within ourselves
we may see any place in the cosmos
now becoming aware of the cosmic mind
one with your own
ask that your vision be open
to any civilization
capable of reaching the earth
and just allow your mind to scan
the earth the oceans
your area
our solar system
interstellar or galaxy
intergalactic infinite
and allow your mind
and give permission to yourself to see
and be drawn to
any people from any star system
with whom you are resonating
and now you sense they see you
and they are joining us in this
meditation
and take a moment as you go within with
permission they&#39;re starships
and see that these people
that are awake just as we are although
they are different
deep within we are the same
we are one we are awake
and thus there is one great being
and the light of consciousness shining
through the eyes
of all beings on earth
and throughout the cosmos
being thus centered in this state of
oneness
introduce yourself by name to them
and show them where you reside
on planet earth
and so you may zoom in
to wherever you are on the planet
from their direction
and you can show them the continent
where you are the country
the region the town the city
the house exactly and precisely
where you are
and invite them to visit
in any way that is safe and appropriate
for this time in this place
on earth
and acknowledge to them they may contact
you
in thought in light
in consciousness through electronic
devices
with starships in the sky
with objects overhead
with et beings materialized or
dematerialized
near you and that you understand
they may choose to appear
in a way that is outside this dimension
but very close to you
and as we do this invite them
to join us in this meditation in prayer
and we gaze together upon the earth
and we see the earth from space a
biosphere of life
an emerging civilization
and we send a light
a piece of enlightenment
a pure conscious energy
that permeates the earth and all who
dwell
upon her and we see
that the earth becomes lighter
a golden light envelops the earth
and every heart and mind on the planet
is revivified and awakened by this
energy
coming from the great being
and we ask these civilizations to join
us
as we ask the great spirit to protect
the earth
and her people and to help us establish
a time
of universal peace on earth
and amongst the stars
they are waiting for us to reach that
state
of evolution and they are eager
to have ambassadors from earth
brothers and sisters with whom they can
work
and so we offer ourselves in service
to the good future to a new
civilization on earth and we ask that
these civilizations from other star
systems
assist us in seeing in unseen ways
and that we ask the great and unbounded
being
to guide us and to protect us
and we gaze upon the earth with kindness
and we see our leaders and all the
people of the earth
turning away from the path of
destruction
and division onto the path
of ineffable infinite peace
that comes from within from the pure
light within each of us
the one mind the one being
and in this we see the future
where the humanity that is today on
earth
is transformed into an enlightened
people
at peace with each other and at peace
in the cosmos and in the passage of time
we see the earth made into a rose garden
of enlightenment and all the wondrous
sciences
and technologies released for peaceful
uses
and the earth is healed
and the burden that we have placed upon
her is lifted
and humanity fulfills its destiny
to live on earth in peace and
enlightenment
and to travel amongst the stars
as a people living in peace
namaste
wow are you back
it takes me a minute yeah it takes me a
minute
thank you for that and
you know what uh what i enjoy
uh about what we just
did with you is that i&#39;m a guy
as you know i walk around amped up and a
little loud
and this allows me to to get centered
get my feet back on
on the ground and put myself into check
so
i thank you for that and we all do uh
really quick before uh we
we depart here is how can everybody
reach out to you how can everybody uh
help and of course see and and download
uh the ce5 program too as well what
what&#39;s the best source for everything
well you know we have a new app out
that&#39;s called ce5
contact and that enables everyone it has
a lot of these meditations and the
remote viewing techniques
in it but it also has um you know like
dating apps will let you see who&#39;s in
your area to
chat with it has a function so if you&#39;re
living in
las vegas or wherever you are you can
see who&#39;s in your area
and connect with them and so you can
create your own team
and if you can&#39;t meet personally you can
do it virtually like this
so that has just come out so you can get
that and it really does train that&#39;s
what
demi lovato was using which had this
amazing event happen
with her friends on her birthday in july
the other thing is our website
siriusdisclosure.com you can get a free
newsletter there
in fact you should sign up there if you
think you want to come to this premiere
with me and demi and some other people
who may be coming um
we were hoping that tony robbins and his
wife could come but they&#39;re
busy they&#39;re very big supporters of what
we&#39;re doing also
there&#39;s an uh inspirational motivational
speaker and great mind named tony
robbins he&#39;s very
very interested in this also
so but that&#39;s a way that we can stay in
touch
and then i have uh my youtube channel
which is youtube.com
doctorstevengreer55 dr dr not spelled
out
and that has about 205 videos on it
including all the military witnesses but
a lot of these meditations
um and other resources and i&#39;m at dr
stephen greer on twitter
and then of course instagram and i don&#39;t
remember all the handles i don&#39;t do that
social media stuff but
you can you can put it up there for
people but um
and a facebook also dr stephen greer
so i think people can stay in touch that
way more importantly stay in touch with
each other because what we&#39;re finding is
that people are forming these
ce5 groups all over the world by
connecting through the app
and finding who&#39;s in their area and
they&#39;re having these amazing experiences
so i&#39;m hoping in the next couple of
weeks we&#39;re going to do
one of these sort of events we&#39;ll
announce it but you&#39;re going to need to
follow our social media to know
where demi lovato and i and some of our
people
do a global ce5 out under the stars in a
really remote location
um never done it we&#39;ll try maybe some
technical difficulties but
adrian at disclosure fest is going to
help with that right adrian so um
so it&#39;ll be fun um and then we&#39;re going
to do a similar
event to what we just did at this
premiere so we&#39;re going to have right
before the movie starts
we&#39;re going to do maybe a 10 or 15
minute meditation
with everyone in her network and my work
network
watching and maybe you could plug into
your network too
sure sure this is what i always find
interesting um and not to make
light of it but i think it&#39;s funny
that when we do these mass meditations
certainly like the one we just did right
now
that there was some grumpy old dude
walking down the street in manhattan
talking to himself and then just went
uh what was that oh i feel
kinder and gentler
vibration through the force yeah yeah i
i know
that this is happening thank you so much
dr greer uh
absolutely wonderful conversation let&#39;s
get 2020 behind us let&#39;s get to 2021
lots of great things ahead and you&#39;re a
big part of it thank you so much
thank you look forward to seeing you
november 20th in scottsdale at the
premiere
absolutely and to everybody over at
disclosure fest
