REPORT OF GENERAL MEETING.
A General Meeting of the Society was held on the evening of
January 28th, at the rooms of the Society of British Artists. Professor
Barrett took the chair at 8.30.
Mr. F. W. H. Myers read a paper on "Automatic Writing:-
Some physiological and pathological analogies"; of which the follow-
ing is a brief abstract.
In pursuing our study of automatic writing it is still desirable to-
postpone the more comple~ problems,-those which relate to the content
of the messages, and their possible source external to the automatist,-
until we have learnt more as to their mechanism, and considered
what analogies exist to this apparent multiplication of personalities,.
with none of which the automatist consciously identifies himself.
[A case of Mr. Schiller's serves as a good example of these messages.)
If we consider any of the faxniliar forms of recurrent psychical
disturbance, we find in each case a tendency to the formation of a.
new personality expressive of that disturbed condition alone,.
and isolated from the main current of life. This tendency shows
itself first in the gradual concatenation of a specialized chain of
memory, acts done in the abnormal state being remembered during
the next recurrence of that state, but forgotten in t~e intervaL
This view is supported by·certain phenomena of dream, (example sent
by Mr. Keulemans) of somnambulism, of drunkenness, (example of
negro servant sent by Mr. Keulemans,) of epilepsy, (example sent;
by Professor Barrett,) and of those profounder severa.nces to
which Krishaber gave the name of "nevropathie cerebro-cardiaque,"
(example from Dr. Mesnet). Recent experiment on hypnotic subjects,
moreover, has shown that in some cases a stratum of consciousness,
profounder than any which can find expression otherwise, is reached
through writing of a quasi-automatic kind. (Examples from Professor
Janet, of Havre, one of them hitherto unpublished, and sent expressly
by Professor Janet to the S. P. R.)

Still further, the phenomenon of automatism cannot be said to be
per se any indication of morbid process. Automatic action (as in the
expression of the countenance) tends, as civilisation advances, to assume
a higher relative proportion to voluntary action. Most of our acts of
importance contain a large element either of primary or of secondary
automatism; and as life goes on we increase in delicacy alii automata,
though we lose voluntary muscular power. On the whole, therefore,
we see that parallels may be found to most of the perplexing character-
istics of our automatic messages. We need not treat as unique either
their origination during normal health, or the continuity of the quasi
personages whom they int.roduce, nor their co-existence with ordinary
consciousness, nor even the fact of their permanent exclusion from
the ordinary channels of memory. Considering all these partial, these
alternating, these intercurrent consciousnesses, these memories ravellAd
into a many-stranded rope,-we can no longer draw a marked
line between the conscious and the unconscious. With regard to
any manifestation, at the time apparently automatic, the question
will be whether it has subsequently been included, or seems capable
of being included, in any mnemonic chain, belonging to any·phase
of the agent's personality. It wiH be difficult to answer this ques-
tion in any case with a decided negative. The next phase of the
discussion must turn upon cognate forms of automatism,-table
tilting, trance speaking and the like; after which we shall be better
prepared for a scrutiny into the actual substance of the messages
given through any of these channels: In the mean time there is urgent
need of fresh experiment, fresh observation. The two years during
which such evidence has been earnestly invited have produced some
important cases, such as Mr. Newnham's and Professor Janet's, making
for explanations other than the spiritualistic. On the spiritualistic side
of the inquiry, those years have been almost wholly barren,-scarcely any
trustworthy cases pointing to the agency of disembodied spirits having
been either communicated to the present writer, or given to the world
elsewhere. It is greatly to be desired that a strong effort should be
made by those who hold the spiritualistic view to acquire and publish
any attainable evidence pointing towards so momentous a conclusion.
PHANTASMS OF THE DEAD.
By :MRS. SIDGWICK.
In the paper on " Phantasms of the Dead," in Proceedings, Vol. III.,
I commented (at p. 53) on the absence of any apparent object or
intelligent action on the part of the ghosts haunting houses of which
.accounts have reached our Society. The familiar ghost of fiction who

wanders restlessly about his former abode until he finds someone to
whom he can reveal missing documents or hidden treasure, and then
for ever disappears, has scarcely presented himself for our investi-
gation. There was, however, as I thought it right to mention in a.
foot-note, a single exception to this rule, in a story which I regarded
as insufficiently evidenced. This story, G. No. 173, relates how, when
a certain man died, his will could nowhere be found. The relations
with whom he had lived were in danger of being deprived of his
property, when a new servant entered the family heralded by prophetic
dreams, and from the day she came, began to see a figure which was
invisible to others; but which they ultimately identified from descrip-
tion as their deceased relative. Guided by signs made by this figure.
they found the will in an old book.
This story was sent by a young lady residing in the Channel Islands.
who professed that it was written by her mother, and narrated as a.
personal experience of the latter, and five signatures were appE\nded.
Certain improbabilities, however, both psychical and non-psychical, in
the d~tails, led us to regard it with great suspicion, and this was
strengthened by the form of some of the signatures, e.g., "Dr.
Fitzgerald, LL.D.," with no Christian name. The young lady had been
introduced to us by the editor of a magazine to which she had been a.
contributor, but beyond this we knew nothing of her. It was felt,
therefore, that the story was of no evidential value without further
inquiry.
Since my paper was published; information has reached us which
makes it practically certain that this story is a forgery. And we have
further learnt that an article appeared in SundOl!J Gems for June 26th.
1885,exposing other frauds committed bythesame person,who,it appears.
was in the habit of competing under various aliases for prizes offered by
magazines, and among other things sent under the alias of "Enid
May Fitzgerald," a story purporting to be an original composition and
a1:companied by a certificate, purporting to be signed by "Dr. Fitz-
gerald"-another alias-to the effect that his daughter Enid had received
no assistance in the writing of this tale. The editor of Sunday Ger/U!
discovered that the story sent had been copied from the magazine
Belgravia, and on making inquiries in Jersey he ascertained that no
person or family of the name of Fitzgerald was known on the Island,
and that all letters addressed to the above mentioned names and to
several others, were delivered to our correspondent, who was a young
girl of 18, living with her aunt. On careful examination, the hand-
writings of the young lady's letters to us, of the story stated to bo
written by her mother, and of the different signatures, appeared.
though superficially different, to be all the work of the same hand, with

the doubtful exception of one of the signatures. I have not mentioned
the young lady's name, because it is now over two years since she sent
the story, and a year-and.a-half since the article exposing her frauds
appeared in Sunday Gems. She was then young, and we may hope
that, having had her lesson, she has since amended 'her ways. From the
point of view of human nature, the above facts are depressing, but
from the point of view of Psychical Research, they are, I think, the
reverse. For it is satisfactory that the only case which we have
ascertained to have been fraudulently sent to us should have contained
intrinsically improbable elements which rendered it suspect from the
first. The exceptional character of this story adds another item to
strengthen a conclusion which is, I think, gradually forcing itself on all
members of the Literary Committee, namely, that waking experiences
of the kind they have been investigating are not likely, if genuine, to
diverge widely from certain well marked types, which by no means
coincide with the types which the literary imagination, as manifested
in magazine stories, tends to produce.
CORRESPONDENCE.
To the Ed'itor of the JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCSICAL RESEARCH.
SIR.-SO far &s 1 understand the general intention of Mr. Grignon's
letter in the February nwnber of the JO'Wr'lwJ, it is to point out that I have
not shown myself competent to deal impartially with the evidence for the
"physical phenomena" of Spiritualism, &nd th:1.t therefore it is natural
that SpirituaJists should feel hurt &t my tone, and should dread to expose
themselves to possible criticism by me. And, as far at least as the
Eglintonian evidence is concerned, he extends the objection to Mr. Hodgson,
who, while applying to this evidence a more searching and complete criticism
than mine, agrees in my conclusion with regard to it.
The question of the competence and impartiality of either Mr. Hodgson
or myself is of litUe importance to those who may be able to furnish evidence
to the committee which, under the auspices of our President, has recently
been formed to examine such evidence-since we are not members of that
committee. Still, for my own sake, 1 should like to discuss some of the
points raised by Mr. Grignon, and such discussion may help somewhat in
the elucidation of this difficult subject of "physical phenomena."
It is difficult perhaps to judge impartially of one's own impartiality, but
1 think that some evidence that 1 have not been eager to arrive at a conclu·
sion hostile to the physical phenomena of Spiritualism may be found in the
amount of time and thought which 1 have given to the investigation, and in
the fact that notwithstanding the continual disillusionment which has
attended my personal experience, and notwithstanding my growing
conviction of the inadequacy of most of the evidence presented, my
judgment is still in suspense :-1 still believe, as 1 said in my paper
Digitized by Google
72 Journal of Society fO'1' Psychical Research. [March,I887.
(Proceedings X., p. 72), .that there is Borne evidence which ought not
to be set aside, and I still hope that more and better evidence will be
forthcoming.
However, it will be more to the purpose to meet the specific chllol"ges
which Mr. Grignon brings against me.
He thinks that I should not have mentioned a "discovery which impugns
Mrs. Jencken's truthfulness "-viz., that she or her'" spirits" are willing to
claim as Spiritualistic phenomena, accidental occurrences quite unconnected
with her presence-withoutgiving my grounds for this conclusion. The omis-
sion, due to a desire to shorten the necessarily long account of my experiences,
mayberemedied nowbygivingthe following extractfrom the account of one of
my s6ances with her. The seance took place on April 22nd, 1885,at 14, Dean's-
yard, and there were seven persons present, besides Mrs. Jencken and
myself. I wrote the account on April 30th, 1885.
" Seance at first in the dark. .
" During the earlier part of the seance two single raps occurred on the drum
which lay on the table. Af~er a time, Mrs. J encken, with Miss B. and
Mr. W., withdrew to the door, and while they were there the same rap on
the drum was head again. The' spirits' claimed to have produced them,
but unfortuna.tely we afterwards ascertained that they were caused by water
dropping from the gas lamp." [The gas lamp over the table was one of those
which shorten and lengthen telescopically, with water in the outer tube to
prevent escape of gas. It had been rather overfilled, so that when it was
pushl:ld up out of the way before the seance, water over1l.owed, and some of it
remaining on the branches of the chandelier was dripping very slowly and
irregularly on to the drum.]
Mr. Grignon compla.ins that the next paragraph of my paper is also, as it
stands, not science, but I'hetoric, by which I understand him to mean that I
have given only an abstract of the investigation of Professors Flint, Lee
and Coventry, with rcga.rd to the raps occurring in the presence of Mrs.
Jencken's sisters, and not the full details, I have, however, referred the
reader for these, which it would occupy too much of your space to reproduce
here, to E. W. Capron's Modern Spiritualism; *and I think that anyone who
reads with care the details there given-whether he agrees with the conclusions
of the three Professors or not,-will agree that what they say cannot be sum-
marily dismissed as " worth nothing as evidence." It is not a sufficient reason
for discrediting what appear to have been experiments conducted in a
scientific manner by three medical professors, that certain other doctors
unnamed behaved improperly to Dr. Elliotson, and rejected his conclusions
on insufficient Ii priori grounds.
I observe that my description of the "raps" occurring in Mrs. Jencken's
presence, as "loud double knocks acquiring a special sound from the table,
* Mr. Capron does not profess to quote the whole of the Professors' state-
ments. The full account of their theory is, I believe, to be found in an
article by Professor Austin Flint in the Buffalo Medical Journal for March,
1851, and thesame with additions was published inpamphlet form by Mr. George
H. Derby, of Buffalo. These I have been unable to refer to, but as Mr. Capron
wrote as a Spiritualist and entirely disagreed with the Professors, it is to be
presumed that his quotations are not unfair to the mediums.

:floor, door, or other object on which they appear to be made," ,eems to Mr.
Grignon" extraordinary," not merely, I gather, on account of the style, but
on account of the meaning. Yet from the facts that the :floor, door, &c., give
a character to the sounds, and that simultaneously a vibration may be felt in
these objects, we should surely not be justified-on the Spiritualistic
hypothesis itself-in affirming that knocks are really made on these objects.
We could not say more than that they appear to be made. And that we
ccrtainly cannot say more on a non-Spiritualistic hypothesis will be clearly
seen if I explain a little further the theory of the American doctors, which
Mr. Grignon appears not to have understood. It will be remembered that they
based their theory partly on experiments with a lady who could make
similar sounds by rapid partial dislocation and restoration of the knee joint.
They make the following statement about this lady ;-
"The visible vibration of articles in the room, situated near the operator,
occur if the limb, or any portion of the body, is in contact with them at the
time the sounds are produced. The force of the semi-dislocation of the bone
is sufficient to occasion distinct jarring of the doors, tables, &c., if in contact.
The intensity of the sound may be varied, in proportion to the force of the
muscular contractions, and this will render the apparent source of the
rappings more or leBS distinct." [7 distant.]
By resting the end of a stick--sa.ya walking-stick-firmly aga.i.nst the
floor, the door, an earthen pot, a metal vase, &c., and then knocking on the
other end with a hammer, or with the knuckles, a rough imitation of
what occurred with this lady ma.y be produced, the vibration caused by the
knOCK: being carried along the stick, as the vibration caused by the sudden
displacement and restoration of the joint was presumably carried along the
leg-bone. Raps so made would appear to a person who had no means of
knowing what was being done, to be made on the objects. against which the
stick rests; and if Mr. Grignon will try the experiment he may satisfy
himself that raps may acquire a special sound from objects on which they
only appear to be made. It is not neceBSary that the hard end of the stick
should be in ~mediate contact with the object that is to give character to
the sound. A few thicknesses of paper-say a small pamphlet-may be
interposed without materially affecting the result. It may be well to add
that, in my experience, Mrs. J encken's peculiar raps have always seemed to
proceed from some point close to her, so far as I remember; if she wants to
make the sound on the door, for instance, she stands by the door. It is, of
course, however, probable that if she be an impostor, she can sometimes
succeed by suggestion &c., in making tIlem seem to come from more dis~t
parts of the room.
Mr. Grignon next observes that" the admirable method adopted by the
Society in dealing with alleged phantasms lo.ardly seems to have been applied
here," i.e., to the investigation of "physical phenomena." Now the only
evidence about" physical phenomena" collected in any sense by the Society,
which has, so far as I remember, been printed at all, is that aboutMl".
Eglinton's slate-writing. I preswne, therefore, that it is to this that Mr.
Grignon refers. The treatment of it has differed in two important respects
from that of phantasms of the living. (1) It has not been discussed by a

74 Journal of Society /01' Psychical Be,search. [March,1887.
committee. (2) The whole of it, so far as we were permittl'd to publish it,
haa heen printed, and the discuBBion and criticism applied to it have been
applied in the Journal before the whole Society; while in the case of
phantasms the discussion and criticism have been carried on in private by the
Literary Committee, and a large amount of the evidence in consequence
rejected without being laid before the Society as a body at all.
But I do not think that those are the differences of treatment to which
Mr. Grignon o.lludes. I think he means that the method of dealing with
the evidence has in itself been different-apart from the persons by whom
it haa been applied, and the publicity given to it. And this, so far &8
general principles of treatment are concerned, I cannot admit. In detail, of
course, differences must exist ;-thus the laborious inquiry into dates, so
IleCeBB&ry in the C&Be of phantasms of the living, has no place in the question
of the nature of Mr. Eglinton's slate-writing; and any investigation into
the poaaibilities of conjuring is in general irrelevant to a discussion of the
connection of a hallucination with a death. But the broad principles of
treatment have been the same, Ilnd have consisted in (1) obtaining first-hand
testimony from aa many witneBSes as pOBBible--{it is mainly by obtaining thia
that percipionts of phantasms have been able to strengthen their evidence);
and (2) in carefully examining whether known causes of the observed pheno-
menon are adequately excluded-without which, of course, no advance can
be made towards proving the existence of the alleged unknown cause.
As to (1) it woulJ hardly seem that any first-hand testimony is pOBBible
in the C&BeS of Mr. Eglinton's slate-writing recorded in the Journal for
June, except that of the persons present-and this haa in the great majority
of instances been obtained-either in the form of independent accounts, or of
signatures to one account. And except in the matter of corroboration, it does
not seem to me that such evidence as that in the J01.IINW for June can be
strengthened.Wherevep the value of one's testimony depends on the accuracy
of observation and recollection of what occurred during the experiment,
which is,I think, the case in all the June JOlllrtW evidence, it is dangerous to
attempt to go beyond or behind one's own notes. This is true of experimental
investigation in genero.l. If on examining ono's notes it is found that some im-
portant observation haa been omitted, it is generally better,even if one thinks
one recollects making it, to repeat the experiment, rather than to allow a gap
to be filled bylater memory. Afm·tiori is this the case where what haa chiefly
to be guarded against is the poaaibility of intentional deception-·of an inten-
tionally produced illusion. However, whether this view of mine be right or
"!1"Ong, the witneBBes have, I presume, had every opportunity since June
of saying in the Jourlw anything which they thought tended to strengthen
their evidence.
The second point-examining whether known causes of the phenomenon
have boen adequately excluded-involves the destructive criticism
of which Mr. Grignon complains. But similar destructive criticism
has been freely applied in the case of phantasms, and must always be
applied in all scientific in\"estigation. Rigid search for and exclusion of
known causes ia the only method by which unknown causes can be established.
The criticism applied to C&BeS of phantasms of the living has been most destruc-

tive. 1\lr. Gurney tells us incidentally in his book (Vol. I., p.137), that it h&&
swept away more than two-thirds of the spontaneous cases of alleged
telepathy, and in experimental telepathy it has led to the rejection of the
whole class of cases of the willing-game type-experiments, that is, where the.
agent and percipient being in contact, the agent ,. wills" the percipient to do
something involving movement. The treatment of this last cl8Bs of cases.
illustrates well the way in which the slate-writing evidence should, I think,
be regarded by those who consider that I have not sufficient grounds for my
own conclusion that Mr. Eglinton is a conjurer pure and simple. In rejecting-
the willing-game experiments it is not improbable that a number of genuine.
telepathic cases have been rejected. Bllt the experiments of Mr. Sugden.
and othera have shown that it is impoBSible to lay down the limits of
sensibility to slight musclllar and tactile hints, and consequently, as
Mr. Gurney says (Vol. I., p. 17), the best willing-game cases "could
never be wholly conclusive, and mere multiplication adds nothing to.
their weight. By some the theory of muscular guidance is undoubtedly'
strained ; but then it ought to be strained, and strained to the very
utmost before being declared inadequate. and it would always be a.
matter of opinion whether the point of utmost strain had been overp8BSed."
Similarly in slate-writing, Mr. Hodgson has shown by comparing the
accounts of different witnesses, and Mr. Davey has shown experimentally, how'
little human observation and memory can be trusted under conditions such.
as obtain at Mr. Eglinton's seances; and therefore we cannot infer from
the impOBBibility of explaining by conjuring the slate-writing as described,.
or as we seem to ourselves to have witneBSed it, that it was really produced.
by occult means. (Mr. Grignon need not be afraid that all reliance on human
testimony, or on the evidence of our senses must therefore be abandoned,
since the conditions ofa conjuring performance are rarely eyen approached in
ordinary human experience.) After reading Mr. Davey's experience it does not.
even seem necessary to Iluppose malobservation &c., going materially beyond
what can be shown to have occurred, in order to explain the "psychography"
of Messrs. Slade, Eglinton and others. But granting that the conjuring'
hypothesis had to be strained, I should hold, as Mr. Gurney does in the
case of muscle-reading, that we are bound to strain it-to strain it so as to,
allow a considerable margin beyond .whatcan be proved possible for a conjurer
-and that, therefore, to prove occult slate-writing itmust be obtained under'
entirely different conditions; just as to prove thought-transference it had.
to be obtained without any contact at all.
I am sorry that in the Journal, for June I 'stated my belief that Mr.
Eglinton's performances are merely clever conjuring; not because I llave.
at all changed my lllind, but because I think the statement has tended to
confuse the minds of Spiritualists as to the real point at wue. It is of very
little importance to the world whether Mr. Eglinton is a conjurer pure and.
simple or not-and of absolutely no importance what I happen to think about,
it-so long as he does not produce phenomena which can be clearly dis-
tinguished from conjuring. Of course I do not mean that the evidence that
Mr. Eglinton has tricked is unimportant. It is important because it makes.
the solution of a further problem unneceBSary. This further problem is the.

()ne which would arise in the case of " physical phenomena," due to a medium
whose honesty in the matter was above suspicion. It would then be
necessary, in order to obtain the full moral weight of the evidence for the
()ccult nature of the phenomena, to consider whether the pOBBibility was
sufficiently excluded of an abnormal state in the medium·-a state in which
the actions required to produce the observed result might be uncollsciously
performed. It seems not unlikely, for instance, that in the case of the
hysterical girl described by Mr. Myers at the last meeting of the Society,
"Adrienne" might have rapped on the table or written on the slate, while her
conscious alter ego" Louise" was quite unaware of it. Where trickery must
be assumed .probable such invest~tion into abnormal states is of course
unneceBBary. .
And this brings me to Mr. Grignon's complaint that I have not allowed
weight to the "fact" that Mr. Eglinton has never been" exposed" ;-1
presume he means in slate-writing. I cert3.i.nly think that, had this been a
fact, it would have been a reason for still hesitating to pronounce Mr.
Eglinton a mere conjurer, though it would not prove that his performances
wero beyond the limits of possible conjuring. It would, in fact, have
introduced some amount-it is difficult to say how much-of improbability
into the conjuring theory. Two years ago I belie"ed with Mr. Grignon that
there was no evidence that Mr. Eglinton had beenthus detected; but, when
I wrote my remarks about him, I had learnt that such evidence existed, and
was Ilufficient, in my opinion, to show that more than one person had
detected him in tricks connected with slate-writing. I could not, of course,
avoid being influencr.d by this evidence, though I thought it undesirable to
mention it, as I was unable to produce it. It must not be assumed that
-everyone who detects a medium at once rushes into print. It requires in
general some public spirit, or genuine interest in Spiritualism, to induce a
person to take the trouble and run the risk of annoyance involved. " Mr•
.Eglinton might make himself very disagreeable," as one detector said. Other
motives also operate to prevent people publishing such evidence, e.g., the
view which some Spiritualists seem to entertain that it is good for the cause
·to hush up scandals of the kind-a most disastrous vile'w, as it seems to me, if
the cause be a genuine one. However, I quite admit that, to meet the force
-of Mr. Grignon's argument, it is needful to put the public in possession of
.some evidence on this point, and I hope this will be done before long.-
I am, &c.,

was over. That the word Boorzu was written on the slate by some means or
other-this, I presume, we may accept as an undisputed fact. Now. on the
testimony of one of the witnesses when this word was discovered on .the
slate, Mr. Davey (Clifford) " was positive he had never heard it before." On
the same testimony he had also forgotten Mr. Padshah's request to get his
(Mr. Padshah's) name written on the slate. And this testimony is adduced
by Mr. Davey himself without contradiction or comment. He does not even
insert a mark of interrogation, 1\8 he does elsewhere when he considers that
some statement of a witness is not strictly accurate. We have no choice
therefore. We are forced to the conclusion that, as I stated in my lastletter,
"Mr. Davey can detect the word that lurks in another mind and write it in
a locked slate without himself being conscious of having done so," and that
too by his own unaided powers as a slate·writing conjurer. This is his own
unvarnished testimony, and to it you do not hesitate to attach your
imprimatur when you speak of tho records of Mr. Davey's witnesses as
"the bond fide records of tricks."
I do sincerely hope, Sir, that the S. P. R., whose muon d'8tre, it is
acknowledged, is the pursuit of science, will not find it necessary to make any
unreasonable demands on the faith of its members. At present it seems to
me that what is offered us is simply the choice whether we shall believe
Messrs. Davey and Hodgson, or, for instance, Messrs. Eglinton and Farmer.
Whether this be inevitable or not, it is. surely hardly in accordance with the
requirements of science. I may be wrong, and, if I am, no one can be morl)
ready to be set right, but if I am not wrong, we are here called upon to believe
a thing before which the wonders of Spiritualism sink into insignificance, and
that, too, on ~he testinlony of one man. Of course I do not forget that you
have told us that another, viz., Mr. Hodgson, "having been initiated into the
trick, has been able to observe the whole process." But has Mr. Hodgson
been able to observe how the word Boorz or Boorzu was written in the slate
without Mr. Davey's knowledge1 If so, then Mr. Hodgson must be 'regarded
as a greater adept as to the modus operandi of Mr. Davey's tricks than Mr.
Davey himself. But if Mr. Hodgson and yourself, sir, have got into the
heart of the mystery, surely the members of the S. P. R. may fairly expect
something more than "the pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, as, well,
well, we know, or, we could and we would," and so on. I acknowledge.
indeed, that you hold forth a promise in your note that you will " discuss
these subjects further in the Proceedinfls, and that you will point out where
the chief failures of some of the witnesses occurred." But for my own part,
I may say that the pointing out of the failures of the wit·nesses seeUlS to be
a matter of very secondary importance. I presume i~ will not be denied
that tlle name Boorzu was written by some means or other, and that Mr.
Davey said about it what Mrs. Russell reports him to have said. The ONE
point, therefore, which I, for one, am anxious to have cleared up is-how
that word Boorzu was written.-I remain, &c., GEORGE HARPUR.

follow, I suppose, that this factor is also of special efficacy in spontaneous
·telepathy. I therefore venture to put a few questions for solution, if not by
past, then by future experience. And I do not think that the undoubted
difficulties which an agent would find in self-observation are insurmountable.
1. Is it ever found to be the case that a thought, by an innate power in
itself simply, is transmitted to the percipient 1
2. Or must there accompany it the idea of its being transmitted and of
its arising in the mind of the percipient 1
3. Is it essential there should be a desire that it should be transmitted to
the percipient 1
4. Must there be an expectation, more or less confident, that the thought
will be transmitted to the percipient 1
5. Must there be will 1 H so, are any shades of difference noticeable
between willing that is successful and willing that is unsuccessful 1
I must explain. Question 5 to my mind is only questions 2, 3, 4 in
combination. In the active will my own introspection discovers only a desire
()f the act, a thought of the act, and a confident expectation or belief that
the act will take place.
In the so-called passive will there seems to be a positive and negative
desire of the act, a neutrality of desire; a thought of the act and a weak
belief or expectancy that it will take place.
And if a weak belief, in the case of the passive will, suffices to produce,
say, a feeble bodily movement, then one would suppose that a stronger
expectation would produce a more vigorous movement, and that a confident
expectation or a belief would produce a movement indistinguishable from
that produced by the active will. And I know at least one case in which an
-attempt having been made, the will being passiva, to move the arm by
expectancy, at first a feeble movement was produced, which grew stronger
-as the expectation grew stronger; till at present the movement by full
belief is hardly distinguishable from that by the active will. It would be
surprising if this were not the case with most people, if they could only get
themselves to expectand believe. H not, perhaps desire is necessary to render
the thought sufficiently vivid to enable them to realise, believe, and act.
It may be, nevertheless, that though desire in ordinary experience always
accompanies the will, what constitutes, or is at any rate the prime factor in,
the will is confident expectation or belief. It comes last in the psychical series
preceding the sense of effort. It is well known that a man who firmly
believes he cannot moye, really cannot, however much he may desire. And,
finally, that belief i& a great force is sufficiently exemplified by the phenomena
of "miraculous" cures.
H, then, the will were necessary in thought.transference, this might mean,
after all, only that confident expectation or belief in the success of each
experiment is the condition of mind which the agent should cultivate. For
"hard willing," so faras it is apt to be only strongly desiring, would seenl to
be of little use. This so far would oblige an answer in the affirmative to the
fourth, and, inclusively, to the second question.
But I prefer to leave the questions to your readers' consideration, with-
out ·expressing any opinion as to what solution might be arrived at. I may,
however, mention an experiment. I was operating behind a percipient's

back with cards. I turned up the ace of spades, and this was my state of
mind: "Now, if you guess anything, you will guess this" (unspoken), and
it was immediately guessed. I ascribed this success to the special state of
-expectancy; but, of course, without any certainty.
If expectancy should, possibly, be discovered to be of special efficacy in
thought-transference, ~en, to perceive it operating in spontaneous telepathy,
oOne would probably have to piercethrough an elementof still greater obscurity.
But as it is not proved, and I do not assume it to operate in the first, it
would be absurd to speculate upon its operation in the second.
But, I may ask, does it, or belief, exist in the mind of the agent in tele·

ANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING.
The Fifth Annual Business Meeting of the Members of the Society
'Was held at 14, Dean's-yard, London, S.W., on the 28th of January.
Frofessor Sidgwick occupied the chair. An audited balance-sheet of the
receipts and expenditure of the Society during the year 1886 was
placed before the meeting, and appears on the next page. A letter
from tae auditor was also read, expressing his sn.tisfaction with the way
in which the books were kept. From a statement of the assets and
liabilities at the end of 1886, it appeared that they nearly balanced,
independent of the value of the Library belonging to the Society, and
of the stock of Proceedings. The number of Members of all classes on
the 1st of January, 1887, was 661, showing an advance of 13 in the
year 1886. .
No additional nominations for Members of Council having been sent
in, those gentlemen whose names were included in the notice convening
-the meeting were declared duly elected.
