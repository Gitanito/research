So, they gave me extra anesthesia.  Soon, my vital signs were fading. Then I saw myself dressed in white, with a long robe, my hands fixed to my sides without movement, my feet pointed on tiptoe, and flying towards a strong and infinite light, which shone on my forehead. A grey metallic tunnel surrounded me.  There were grey balls, like molecules floating and striking one another.  But when these touched me, they rebounded and formed new ones. I continued to the light as if I wanted to leave the tunnel.

Suddenly I saw myself in an emergency room where everyone around me was working with an artificial respirator and I heard their voices as if distantly.  I moved my hands and my mom started crying because she saw I was back. It was and experience of peace, marvelous and unforgettable.
