  		              		Experience Description   

    My experience completely changed my life during during a surgery over half my life ago.  I am currently 32 years old. 

   I was 14 years old when I was treated for an arteriovenous malformation. The nurse gave me a dose of morphine but forgot to note it in my medical chart.  A few minutes later there was a shift change. At that time, I was given another dose of morphine by a different nurse. Immediately, I started having a reaction that was witnessed by my mother.  

  I was gone for less than a minute. In that time, my consciousness left my body. I experienced the most peaceful and comforting time that was unlike anything I had every experienced on earth.  I was lifted from my physical body and up through a tunnel. Then, I was greeted by figures appearing as shadows, yet I knew that they were my family and loved ones. At this time, I felt as though I was in a state of ecstasy. No words were spoken, but I knew that I had a choice that had no wrong decision. I could stay where I was or I could go back to my physical body. I chose to come back.   
  
       Like a flash of light, I woke up to see my mother crying by my bedside. It was not my time to leave.       

  To this day I still have sleep paralysis on a regular basis, in which the shadows that I saw come to visit me. I found it terrifying at first, but now I know they are just checking on me.
