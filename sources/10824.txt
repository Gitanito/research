I was able to see the car rushing me to the hospital from above (I was floating behind the car approximately ten feet above the street).  I was able to see myself in the back seat of the car.  I then remember seeing myself being operated on.


At the time, I didn't acknowledge my experience.  Being six years old, I didn't know how to describe what I felt and saw.  I noticed shortly afterward that I was able to see energy in random objects and to this day I get a sense of the molecular makeup of objects.

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?      Yes     I noticed shortly afterward that I was able to see energy in random objects and to this day I get a sense of the molecular makeup of objects usually home furnishings. (I have no idea why I seem to notice this mostly with chairs and couches.)

Have you ever shared this experience with others?    Yes    Mixed, some people want to know everything some people think I imagined the experience.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?    Yes   I tried LSD in college and had several out of body experiences during a two day period.
