I had gained fifty pounds and had been in labor for two days. I was finally given a caudal anesthesia, which numbed the lower half of my body. I was moved into the delivery room. They expected the baby to be large (I am a tall woman and my husband was a football player - University of Michigan, then Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders). There were a number of doctors/interns in the delivery room - betting on how much this baby would weigh. When he was finally born, I have very clear visual pictures of the nurse carrying him past me on my left side.  She was holding on to his feet with one hand and his head with the other hand - to go weigh him (11 lbs 4 oz.), I saw his testicles and it was at that point that I drifted up to the right hand corner of the delivery room and watched what went on.

As he was born, there was a huge splash of water (I thought) - the doctors/interns jumped back out of the way. Just recently I was describing this experience to a nurse who was delivering my daughter's baby and when I said 'water,' she corrected me: 'That was blood, not water - you hemorrhaged!!' I am now sure that was correct, because at the time, the nurses were frantically trying to hook me up to IVs of blood. They could not find a blood vessel to insert the adrenaline (I guess) and finally they put a tourniquet on each lower arm so they could insert needles for the blood transfusions.

I was up in the corner of the room, watching all this activity. What I can say is that I felt what I now describe as 'orgasmic' peace!!! I will never fear death because this feeling of peace was just bliss!!! I did not go anywhere or see anyone. I stayed floating in the corner of the ceiling.
