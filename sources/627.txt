THIRST, search throughout, well examine, and daily
“*
■ meditate on every single portion of the holy Scrip­
tures hereinafter mentioned for your benefit, until you
perfectly understand the whole of the same; then con­
sider whether you are thefriend of God,from whom all
blessings flow, or otherwise (John xv, i3—15. Cant.
v, 16. James iv, 4, 6-—10. Phil, iii, 18—20. Col. i,
21*—28.). And also whether you actually see a real
necessity of having your wants relieved ; and also
whether you are properly disposed and duly prepared to
approach the throne ofgrace ; whether you are clothed
with a wedding garment or otherwise (Matt, xxii, 11
— 14.). and have also tasted of the fruits of regeneration
(John iii, 3-—13.), for if you come without these neces­
sary qualifications God will not hear you (Psalm Ixvi, 18.
John ix, 31. Isaiah lxvi, 2.) ; and also remember at the
same time that there is only one kind of worship that is
acceptable unto God (John iv, 23, 24. Prov. xxiii, 96.)
all other kinds and forms of worship are nothing less
than solemn mockery, which above all things is most
abominable unto the Lord (Prov. xxviii, 9. iii. 32.

Luke xvi, 15. Rev. xxi, 27- Rom. viii, 4*—
8, 13, 14.) j
therefore we find that many who call themselves Chris-
tians, have in reality no more right or title to that name,
than the Heathen, Turk, Hottentot, or Infidel; and
even those who are Christians will only keep theii^ titles
good by.great diligence, hard daily labour, and industry;
having continually three strong and most powerful
enemies, who are daily and hourly seeking their ruin
and destruction 5 but in order that you may know them
and guard against them, I will now set them before, yoti:
—the first is the Devil, ((who goeth about like a roaring
lion, seeking whom he may devour” D^Peter v, 8, 9.
Zech. iii, l, 2. Rev. xii, 10. I Jofjf^^l 8. John viii,
44, 45. Matt, xiii, 39. Luke viii^tl. Eph. iv, 27. I
Tim. iii, 6, 7* Heh. ii, 14. James iv, 7. Acts xiii, 10.)
—our second enemy, that also daily cometh out against us
in order to complete our ruin and destruction, is the
World {John xv, 18, 19. I John i i ,15—17. Ecctes. v,
10, IK l John v, \9. James iv, 4, 17.' v, 1—5. Gal.
i, 4.) —and our third strong and potent enemy isan enemy
near home, who is also daily and hourly watching for
every opportunity to complete our ruin and destruction
both in this world and alio in that which is to come,
which is the Flesh {Rom. viii, 6—13. Gal. v, l6-*26.
Rom. vii, 18, 23, 24. James i, 14, i5. I Tim. vi, 9—19.
Col. iii, 5—10.)— and our fourth and last enemy is
Death (I Cor. xv, 26, 35, 36.); therefore perhaps you
will find it a more laborious work, and also much more
difficult to learn how to become a Christian, than you
wereheretofore awareof. The wordChristianimplies atrue
and most ikithful follower and disciple of Jesus Christ.
For these great, powerful, and mighty enemies will
always find you work enough every aa», and will also
teach you the great necessity of putting on the whole
armour of God {Eph. vi, 11—- ’
.8.) before you can
become a Christian, and also that the wotk is hard and
■ Digitized by v j O O ^ I C
difficult to the carnal mind, yet if you neglect or refuseto
learn this great?necessary, and most important lesson^be
assured you had much better never have, been bom
( Eph. iv, 20--32- Deut. iv, 10, v, 1. xvii, 19« xxxi, 1»,
13. Isaiah xxvi, 9- 10. Matt, ix, 13. xi, 29. Gal. iii,
#. John vi, 45. Phil. iv, 8, 9» 11—13.); for we are sent
into this world to daily work, fight, and pray, which
ought to be th^ principal business of our whole lives
(1 7 m . i, 18. Jantes iv, 1, 2. I Peter ii, 11. Acts xiii,
2. JoAnxvii,4. I Cor. iii, i3—17. ix, 1, II Tim. ii, 4.
J antes i, 25. ii, 24. II Cor. xi, i5. Rev.xiv, i3. xx, i2^
i3. I Tim. vi, 12. II Tim. iv, 7« Het. x, 29^-32. Luke
xviii, i; I Thes9v, 17). If you live contrary to this rule,
I suppose you know the consequences, as we all know
that there will be no more than two distinct glasses of
people ever found amongst us, viz. Righteous and
IVicked, and whoever is not united to the one, must of
course be joined unto the other (I Peter iv 17, 18. Matt
xvi, 27. II Tim. iv, i4) But if you are desirous to be
taught or further instructed in any essential point,
subject, matter^ Or thing, relating to divinity, if you
will only apply, send, or come unto me, your request
shall be immediately granted; for when Saint Paul saw
and well knew for himself, what he had to learn before
he could become a Christian, he almost despaired, but
God said unto him My grace is sufficient for thee (II
Cor. xii, 8—
uo). By this Celestial Touchstone you may
thus daily try and examine all the thoughts,, words9
deeds, and actions of your past Jives, and thereby know
for yourselves whether you enjoy the favour q f Gcd
and the hopes of heaven, or otherwise (Jer. xviii, 8—10.
xxvi, 13. Gen. iv, 7. Psalm cix, 5—7* Prov.x, 16, 19*

tate on those valuable and most precious texts which I
have also given unto you in my Temple of Wisdom,
hereunto annexed for your benefit, yonr judgment will
be thereby moat fully informed, and your mind divinely
illuminated by the same. If we now look before us,
we shall see au offended angry God, whose mercy hath
hitherto been disregarded a»d lightly esteemed (Hei.x, j
29~>3i); and if wc look behind us, we shall see an army
of most severe judgments from heaven at our heels (see
7&
y Celestial M onitor'; if ai\y man can pròve the
contrary, I shall be yery glad to see him. Indeed, the
arm of flesh is now getting too weak and feeble, either
to prevent our mortal diseases* or of onr being defeated
by our common enemies (Jar. xvii, 5, 6. See ike tenth
htrnm ite. in my Temple of Wisdom*} ; therefore
turn unto the Lord*s side before it be too late {Exodus
xxxii, 2Ô), or otherwise you will have a whole eternity to
repent of this your folly and madness. If I had been
so happily situated 'in the world as to have had my
dwelling among cfanstiens, I should then never have
had occasion to have written my w Disserfaim* on Fiê-
lany*
* ; but let you and me doily meditate on the pwre
word of God, seeing that we stand in jeopardy every
bow (I Cor. xv, 30. LwArxH, 20, fr. Matt, xxiv, 42-*
A4 XXV, i3. Mark xii, 33—3f . Lukexxi, 36. Aetsxrx,
3i.) If Death, Judgment, Heaven and HeU are subjects
that cannot command your most serious attention, or
do not concern you, in that case be assured our writings
will yield but very little profit unto you indeed. (Heb%

Thus should I daily rejoice to find yot> that truly
happy man who was bom in the city of Regeneration
in the parish of Repentance; who was educated ih the
school of obedience; who now lives in perseverance*
and works at the track of diligence, notwithstanding he
has a large estate in the county of Christian Content­
m ent; who often ditttbs the mountain of Spiritual
Mindedness and wears the plain garb of humility, but
has a better to put on when he goes to court* mailed the
robe of Christ's righteousness; who walks in the valley
o f Self Abasement, and does jobs ot self-denial ; who
breakfasts upon Spiritual prayers and Sups on the same/
who has also meat to eat which the world knows nothing
o f \ whose drink is the sincere milk of the word. Thus
happy he lives and happy he dges. Happy is he who
has gospel-submission m his will— due order in his
affections— sound peace in his conscience— grace in
his soul— teal divinity in his breast-—true humility in
his heart— the Redeemer'.* on his neck— a vain
world under his feet— and a crown of glory on his
head. To attain this, pray fervently— believe firmly
— wait patiently— work abundantly— live holy— die
daily— watch your heart— guide vouractions— redeem
tim e— love Christ— and long for glory !
Happv the man that finds the grace,
1 he blessings of God's cbosen race,
The wisdom coming from above,
The faith that sweetly works by love.
Happv beyond description he,

The aift unspeakable obtains, _

And heavenly understanding gaine.
