 Essene, The.
 A Magazine of Construction.
 Life, Light, Liberty / I have no creed, or if a creed but this: I love humanity
 1902-1917?  Monthly
 Denver, CO.  Publisher: Reed Publishing Co..  Editor: James Arthur Edgerton and Grace Mann Brown ("Ione").
 1/1, July 1902-1917(?)  $1.00 a year, 48-16 pp.  Noted as received by the Banner of Light 91/21 (July 19, 1902): 4, and noted in The Swastika, May 1908, which mentions that it had re-appeared after a hiatus.

 Edgerton was noted at the time as a "poet of the western plains" and is now forgotten except for his later role as president of the International New Thought Alliance.  Brown ("Ione," 1859-1925) wrote frequently on the Essenes for the Swastika and many other journals as well as this one, and advertised widely for "the modern organization"-- her own Essene Circle.  Its teachings, from her articles and published lessons, have little content besides her conviction that the Essenes were the forerunners of Masonry and all modern occult movements; they were the "ancient spiritualists" and "Cosmic Thinkers" of the earth.  The journal described itself as a  journal of the Sunrise, a product of the New Age, brought to birth by the burgeoning New Thought movement.  Brown says of the Essenes that they were "a people of real spiritual vision, who practice brotherhood in their lives."  The Essene Circle in Denver was still being noted in New Thought journals as late as 1916.  S.C. Gould, in the Rosicrucian Brotherhood, 1908, says of the order:

 	"The modern Society of the Essenes is distinctly practical. Its foundation word is 'Construction.' It builds upon the belief that the God manifestation in all expressions of life is the result of combined Action of Love and Wisdom which is in one word -- CONSTRUCTION. The members of this Order meet at twelve o'clock every day together in thought and send to each other and all the world a thought message of construction. All sin, sickness, poverty and health must be dissolved from the earth planet, through constructive thoughts, words, and deeds of the race.

 These Essenes teach and practice healing of the body, mind, and purse, and in the absolute overcoming of evil and the manifestation of perfection. There are Essene Circles established in different cities and towns in all parts of the world, and others are being formed. . . .  Grace M. Brown is President."

 Over the years Brown was also connected with Weltmer's Magazine, Fulfillment, and Ione's Life Studies.  The journal carried monthly installment of Brown's Esoteric Studies, Common Sense Talks with Ione, Life Lessons, Studies in Spiritual Harmony, and the like, on Vibration, Concentration, Breathing, etc.).
