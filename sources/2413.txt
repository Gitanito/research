Our ignorance of w
hat has been going on in France in
the last two years is a com
m
on-place, but one w
hich has not
yet lost its pow
er to startle. It is natural, therefore, that
w
eshould w
elcom
e, rather uncritically, anyscraps of new
s, or
evengossip, fromFranceandespeciallyfromthenowforbidden
cityof Paris.
It is necessary to choose am

es, but tw
o
recuragainandagain. Thefirstisthealm

selves in Paris. Of

of course they w

conquered city w
ithan unslakable thirst for culture.
The second basic them
e is the failure of the G

their failure. It w
