THE CAUSE AND CURE OF W A R
A prophet of God of proven ability tells the American people
why war is, how it can be stopped, and how the nation can get back
to its Creator. This is truly a prophetic book. It is the most powerful
book l)r. Robinson has ever written. When a true prophet writes,
it is always very plainly. The message this book brings c/''*'—- - . .
lionize the world and bring it back to God. “Holy-men'
“Holy-books” will not like this book. Yet it comes to ^
a true prophet of God. God has not many true prophe
today. Attention should be paid to everything viAngD

Book One
CHAPTER ONE
1. In the beginning, the spirit of god
created the heavens above and the earth in the
middle of the heavens. The heavens means infi­
nite space. It is “in the heavens” that the Spirit
of God has Its dwelling place. This means that
the Spirit of God is everywhere.
2. It is all around us. It is in us. It permeates
the whole universe. Until man becomes conscious
of the Spirit of God throughout all space, and in
him, man is ignorant of the beauties of the realm
of the Spirit of God. i
3. While there was a beginning to this uni­
verse, there was no beginning to God. For God
existed before the creation of the heavens and the
earth. Being Life, capable of existence without
physical form, the Spirit of God existed before
time was. In the Realm of the Spirit of God there
is no such thing as time. All is the Presence of
the Spirit of God.
4. One day, billions upon billions of years ago,
the Spirit of God went into operation. It began to
create the earth upon which we live. This may
10 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
have been the first creation of material things, or
it may not be. We do not know. We do know that
there are millions of planets in the celestial sphere
all around us, and we know that God created all
of those planets.
5. But whether this earth was the first one or
not, we do not know for certainty. It probably is
one of the later creations of the Spirit of God. For,
Almighty God had already created the heavens
in which He had placed millions of stars, each
twinkling brightly, and each revolving in its own
orbit.
6. The heavens therefore do declare the glory
of God and the firmament truly does reveal the
handiwork of God to us humans who live on the
earth. These celestial lights were put there, not to
give light so much as to demonstrate to us just
how great the creative Power of the Spirit of God
really is. They hang in the heavens, in space, with
only the hand of God holding them up and keep­
ing them from falling, so that you and I may
never lose faith in the permanent and present
existence of the Spirit of God on the earth.
7. They are placed there in the heavens as
permanent witnesses to the fact that the Spirit of
God is just as capable of present operations as It
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 11
ever was. If the Power of the Spirit of God was
to be withdrawn from those stars, comets, and
planets for even a fraction of a second, they would
fall and the entire human families, living on all
planets, would be destroyed.
8. God, being the Author and Creator of all
life, cannot perform an act which destroys life.
We may know then, that where the Spirit of God
is, there is life.
9. And God placed nine planets round our sun
which occupies the central position, and which is
more than seven hundred times as large as all of
the nine planets put together.
10. Seeing the marvelous handiwork of the
Spirit of God, man said “Let these nine Plan­
ets be called the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. And it was so. And
the Spirit of God, which had created the nine
planets and the rest of the celestial sphere, caused
the nine planets to revolve around the sun, in
much the same manner as automobiles speed
round a race-track. And it was so.
11. Then the Spirit of God created twenty-six
moons, or satellites, and sent them racing round
the planets. And the Spirit of God so ordained
the creation of the earth and its nine satellites
1 2 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
that our earth only has one moon, while Jupiter
has eight, and Saturn nine. And the Spirit of God
ordained that the planets revolve around the sun
while at the same time the moons are revolving
around the planets.
12. Truly the handiwork of the Spirit of God
is remarkable. Truly the man which the Spirit of
God was to create at a later date need not lack for
evidence of the existence of the Creator, the
Spirit of God.
13. And the Spirit of God also created one
thousand very small planets which man has called
Planetoids. They too revolve along the same track
in space. These are much smaller than the earth,
some of them only having a diameter of one hun­
dred miles, the largest having a diameter of only
about five hundred miles.
14. Then, to make the creation even more
beautiful, the Spirit of God created many shoot­
ing-stars, or meteors. It made too, comets having
long tails. The meteors move in different tracks
around the sun, often colliding with one another.
15. And man said “Let this great assemblage
of planets, moons, planetoids, comets and meteors
be known as the “Solar system.” And it was so.
16. Then the Spirit of God created many other
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 13
galaxies in the heavens millions and millions of
light-years away. This, to demonstrate to the man
which was to follow, how great is the glory of
God. The Spirit of God made the celestial sphere
so great and glorious that man, living on the earth
which is but a very tiny speck in the created
scheme of things, might know that his Creator
had far more ability to take care of him while on
the earth, than man would ever need.
CHAPTER TWO
1. T he spirit of god also created the moon,
and ordained that it should be the earth’s closest
neighbor. Wherever the earth travels round the
sun, the moon always follows along. And the
Spirit of God ordained that the moon be placed
two hundred and forty thousand miles from the
earth. And there the Spirit of God created it.
There it remains, though billions of ages have
elapsed since the Spirit of God created it thus.
2. And the Spirit of God ordained that the
moon have mountains and canals on it, and
ordained further that the surface should be alter­
nately freezing cold and boiling hot. And so the
Spirit of God created it, and so shall it ever be.
3. The Spirit of God said “Let the creation of
the earth be a slow process. Let it proceed accord­
ing to definite plan and Law. There is no time
nor space in “the heavens,” so let the work of
creation proceed in an orderly scientific manner.”
And it was so because the Spirit of God ordained
it to be.
4. And God decreed that millions of ages after
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 15
the creation, man should be able to read the story
of the creation in the rocks. So God decreed that
man should study the rocks, the streams, the for­
ests, and everything upon the earth and under the
earth. And man did so. He called the science of
the study of the earth—Geology.
5. And man, reading the story of the creation
in the rocks, has given to us who live on the earth,
an accurate picture of the differing and varied
periods in the creation. And as man discloses to
us the findings of geology, there is revealed in all
its awe and wonder, the Power which the Spirit
of God possesses. For everything created existed
first in invisible form, in the Realm of the Spirit
of God. This Spirit, the Creator of all we know
and see, spake the words which started the mate­
rial creation in motion. And what God spake into
existence still exists. Truly the handiwork of God
is marvellous. Truly the heavens do declare the
Glory of God. Truly the firmament does show the
handiwork of the Spirit of God.
6. When God created the heavens and the
earth, He ordained that man of every age see His
handiwork. So, in this age, we see the great vol­
canoes which are living witnesses to the cooling
process which the Spirit of God employed in
16 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
forming the earth. Some are live volcanoes, while
others are extinct.
7. And the Spirit of God caused faults to ap­
pear in the surface of the earth, in order that man
might read more clearly the process by which
the Spirit of God created the earth. Huge billows
of smoke and lava even now are flowing from some
of the live volcanoes of the earth. One may not
look upon these evidences of the Creator without
being impressed that a Spirit, great enough to
cause all of this, is great enough to reveal Itself
direct to the man which was to follow on the
earth, at a later date.
8. Now it came to pass that man called the
most primitive era of the earth’s construction, the
Archeozoic era. This was the era of primitive life.
Geologists however, have not been able to give us
too much information as to what happened in
those early eras. It is of little importance however,
for we know that the Spirit of God, which brought
all material creation into being, knows what the
processes were, and why they were. The Spirit of
God ordained that we should be able to read the
story more and more as time goes on. And so it
shall be.
9. In this Archeozoic era, the Spirit of God
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 17
began to create, over vast periods of time, our vast
mountain ranges. While God was not ready yet
to create man, He was, in creation, leaving signs
which man later could discover, that the hand
of God had been evident all through creation,
even millions of ages before man appeared. So
God made the mountains.
10. And the Spirit of Creation also made the
rivers. And it came to pass that the rivers wore
down the rocks, deposited their sediments in the
seas.
11. And the Spirit of God ordained that the
first great mountain range should be formed. This
range ran along the southern portion of Canada
from what is now known as Labrador, to the State
which is now known as Minnesota. And man, who
came later, reading the story of the Spirit of God
in the rocks and mountains, called this range the
Laurentian Mountains.
12. And it came to pass that the rains and the
rivers wore down the mountains, the processes
taking many millions years. But the Spirit of God,
knowing neither time nor space, had ample lei­
sure time to finish Its creation. For the creative
processes of God are always very slow. Millions
of years with God are but as a second of time to
18 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
us who, millions of years later, live on the earth
which the Spirit of God so bounteously created
so many millions of ages ago.
13. Now it came to pass that the Spirit of God,
supervising the wearing away of the mountains
by the rivers and the seas, caused to be formed a
low flat plain having at places, a few scattered
hills. This plain, in turn, was overrun by the
waters, and as the waters covered the plains, a
new era was introduced, known as the Proterozoic
era. This name was given to it by the man which
the Spirit of God later created.
14. And the Spirit of God ordained that this
age should be called the Proterozoic era, because
it refers to the first known life which the Spirit
of God caused to appear on the earth. There was
no life created by any other one than the Spirit
of God, for only the Spirit of God possessed life,
and only the Spirit of God can transmit life.
16. Now it came to pass that the Spirit of God
first brought life to the earth during the Prote­
rozoic era. This Spirit also ordained that evidences
of this life be preserved in their rocks, so that
man, coming millions of ages later, might know
what the first life on the earth was.
17. The first forms of life the Spirit of God
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 19
brought to the earth were forms of plant life—
the humble algae. This humble original form of
life floated upon the face of the stagnant waters.
It must be remembered that the creation up to
this point was purely a material creation. It con­
sisted of planets, rocks, rivers and things which
did not possess in them the Life which came from
the Spirit of God.
18. For the Spirit of God was the only one
from which life could have come. There was no
other Creator. None other possessed life. None
other could transmit life. Only the Spirit of God.
From the operations of the Spirit of God, or the
Spirit of Life, came every known form of Life.
19. While the forming of the planets, the
rocks, the mountains and the rivers took a Spirit
of enormous creative ability, the bringing of Life
to earth, no matter how humble that Life may
have been, was the greatest act the Spirit of God
had performed to that date.
20. Now it came to pass that the Spirit of God,
the Creator, knew far better than anyone else
what form It desired the creation to take. It also
knew what the best processes to be employed
were. None other possessed Life. None other
could transmit Life. None should ever question
2 0 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
the origin of Life. It all came from the Spirit of
God, many, many millions of ages ago.
21. It also came to pass that the Spirit of God
ordained that from this first original creation of
Life, or the passing on of the Life of the Creator
to this earth, should spring all known forms of
life. The Creative Power of the Spirit of God
being so powerful that a very small part of the
Life which was the Creator was all that was nec­
essary for millions of different forms of Life to
grow from that original manifestation of Life on
the earth.
22. Millions of years later, man was to set up
a theory of his own regarding the Creation which
came direct from the Spirit of God. As must be
the case when the original wisdom of the Creator
is threatened, or questioned, the ideas of man were
quickly brought to naught, and the creation
which the Creator brought into being so many
billions of years ago, still lives upon the earth.
It still derives its power of Life direct from the
Spirit of God.
23. The coming of Life to the earth which the
Spirit of God had created, was the most stagger­
ing act of creation ever performed by the Creator.
Now it came to pass that millions of ages later,
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 21
man, not knowing the origin of his own Life,
attempted to designate Life by varied terms. Some
called it the “Life-Principle.” Others called it
the “Life-Germ.” The truth as revealed here is
that these terms, while perhaps partially correct,
miss the point of creation entirely. For the Life
which came to the earth so many millions of ages
ago, and which still lives on the earth, was the
Life of the Spirit of God.
24. From no other source could Life come.
None possessed life but God. None could transmit
Life, but God. None could create Life, but God.
So then, the first created Life on the earth came
direct from the Spirit of God. Therefore, we
know positively that God did create the earth
many millions of years ago. We also know that
Life—the very first forms of Life, regardless of
how minute they may have been, came direct to
the earth from the Spirit of God, the only Power
capable of bringing them to earth.
25. Now it came to pass that the Creator, in
order to manifest these first forms of Life, did
this by placing Its own Life in these different
forms. The Creator desired to create this universe.
It desired to transmit Its overwhelming fullness
of Life in a million different forms, to the earth.
2 2 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
So the Creator, the Spirit of God, planted in all
forms of Life, Its own Power, which is the Spirit
of Life, or, more properly, the Spirit of God.
26. God, the great Creator of this universe and
of all Life, is invisible Spirit. That Spirit con­
tains all the Life there is in the world. Nothing
that has Life can have Life unless that Life come
from the Creator of all Life, the Spirit of God.
Now the Spirit of God possesses Life in such an
extraordinary measure, that It can cause that one
great essence of Life to manifest in a million dif­
ferent ways. The Creator can also ordain that the
Life which It gave, can transmit Itself through
Its varied forms to physical forms.
27. When the Spirit of God causes Life to
manifest itself on the earth, that Life must be the
Spirit of God Itself. Also, the material form, whe­
ther plant, animal, vegetable, or human, is also
caused and created by the same Creator which put
Its Life into the material form.
28. It becomes plainly evident then, that the
object of the Creator was to transmit Its Life,
inside of a material form, to the earth. It was
also the plan of the Creator to endow each form
of physical Life with the ability to reproduce
itself materially. This can only be done through
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 23
the small portion of the Spirit of God, or the
Spirit of Life which the Creator saw fit to place
in each created material creation.
29. We see then that the whole creation, no
matter what its form, came direct from the Spirit
of God, the Creator of all things. Up to the age
which we now know as the Proterozoic age, the
Creator was creating a place upon which Its Life
could operate in a million different forms. Up to
this time, the earth had been formed, but the
Spirit of God had not as yet come to the earth
in any of the many forms in which It is capable
of manifesting.
30. But now, in the Proterozoic age, we find
that the Creator had seen fit to put tiny, infine-
tesimal portions of Life on the earth. That Life,
which the Spirit of God brought to earth so many
ages ago, still lives on the earth. Nothing has been
able to exterminate It. Nothing ever will be able
to exterminate It. For the Spirit of God came to
the earth in humble form, yet It possessed all the
attributes of the Whole Creator.
31. This same Spirit of God, of Life, is still
manifesting in Its very highest form on the earth
today. It manifests in the highest product the
Creator has yet made—Man. It was very much
24 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
later that the Spirit of God created Man, but it
was the very same Spirit of God which was em­
ployed in the creation of Man. There has never
been more than one God, consequently there can
never be more than one Source of Life. So it must
follow that if the Creator is the same, just so long
as any form of Life exists on the earth, that Life
must have come from the Creator. It m ust be the
Life of the Creator, or, the Spirit of God.
32. Not only do the heavens declare the glory
of God, but every created form of Life is a silent
tribute to the creative ability of the Spirit of God.
For we must not forget that when Life, or the
Spirit of God came to earth, that was the most
stupendous, momentous, staggering thing which
has as yet happened on the earth upon which we
now live. We can then trace every bit of mani­
fested Life on the earth today to that little portion
of the Spirit of God which It saw fit to bring to
this earth, so many millions of ages ago.
33. All of the various forms of plant life, all
of the animal kingdom, all the beautiful birds
and flowers which now live on the earth to make
it beautiful for our use, all these came from the
Spirit of God, which, so many millions of years
ago, saw fit to make Itself manifest here on the
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 25
earth, and upon whatever other worlds there may
be. It is worth while remembering that the same
Creator is still keeping yon planets swinging in
their orbits, is still creating Life, and is still living
in that Life, because it all came from God in the
beginning, place that beginning where you may.
You cannot get back of the beginning. So then,
you cannot get back of God.
34. Being the Spirit of God, nothing could
kill the first forms of Life which the Spirit of
God caused to bring to the earth. The Spirit of
God was, and still is, constant on the earth. No
matter what physical form these many creations
may take, the Spirit of Life, or the Spirit of God
behind that material Life, and in it, is still con­
stant. It still abides there. The outward form may
change. It does change. But the Spirit of God
manifesting in that outward form can never
change. For the Spirit of God is constant.
35. For millions of ages the Spirit of God,
manifesting in a thousand different ways, was
threatened with extinction from floods, from
earthquakes, from droughts, from boiling heat to
tropical cold, from volcanic eruptions to cloud­
bursts, still It survived. Being the Spirit of God,
it was the most stupendous Power ever to be
2 6 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
known on the earth. It was Life. It was the Spirit
of God, therefore, no manifestation of nature,
which was also created by God, could ever hurt
the Life which the Spirit of God has seen fit to
bring to earth.
36. To meet one set of needs it formed the
Pterodactyl, the Flying Dragon. To meet another
set of needs, it caused the crocus to grow. As we
progress, we shall find that the Life of the Spirit
of God which had come to earth, took many
different forms to meet the changing conditions
which It found Itself surrounded with. As my
friend Robert Collier so aptly said “To escape
danger on land, It took to the air. To breathe in
the sea, it developed gills. Stranded on land, it
perfected lungs. To meet one kind of a danger it
grew a shell. For another, a sting. To protect
Itself from glacial cold It grew hair. Subject to
alternate heat and cold, It produced feathers. But
ever, from the beginning, It showed Its power
to meet every changing condition, to answer
every need.”
37. Robert Collier, a true prophet of God, was
very near to the truth when he wrote this. He
had not quite conceived that what he called the
“Life-Principle” was actually the Spirit of God
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 27
in operation, which is more understandable than
the word “Life-Principle.” However, the Spirit
of God works in marvellous ways to unfold Its
truth to man. Robert Collier has been, and still
is being used by the Spirit of God to unfold some
of the truths of God to this earth today.
38. Mr. Collier further said, in his famous
“Secret of the Ages,” “had it been possible to kill
this ‘Life-Germ’ it would have perished ages ago,
when fire and flood, drought and famine followed
each other in quick succession. But obstacles, mis­
fortunes, cataclysms, were to it merely new oppor­
tunities to assert its power. In fact, it required
obstacles to awaken it, to show its energy and
resources. The great reptiles, the monster beasts
of antiquity, passed on. But the ‘Life-Principle’
stayed, changing as each age changed, always
developing, improving. Whatever power it was
that brought this ‘Life-Idea’ to the earth, it came
endowed with unlimited power, unlimited energy,
unlimited resource, unlimited LIFE. No other
force can defeat it. No obstacle can hold it back.
All through the history of life and mankind you
can see its directing intelligence—call it nature,
call it providence, call it what you will—rising
to meet every need.”
2 8 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
39. Mr. Collier, with whom I have lunch
quite often, caught the picture. He it was who
helped me in my earlier years as a prophet of God.
I thank Mr. Collier so very much. Great shall be
his reward in the future. Great is his reward now.
CHAPTER THREE
1. T he very first form of life then,
appeared in the Proterozoic age as tiny particles
of plant life. But Life. The Spirit of the Creator
is now operating on the earth in tiny particles of
plant life, so small that they were only visible
under a powerful microscope. But this Life was
from God. It was God. It could not have come
to earth from any other Source than God. It must
be God, then, in the form of tiny plant cells which
contained the Spirit of Life—the Spirit of God.
2. Fifty thousand of them laid together would
not make one inch, so small were these first mani­
festations of the Spirit of God on the earth. They
multiplied by simply breaking in two. These tiny
forms of Life in which exists the Spirit of God
still exist everywhere. In the rain-drop. In the
fallen snow. In the ocean, the lakes, and the
rivers—there they are, the very first form in
which the Spirit of God saw fit to manifest Life
on this earth. Marvellous are the works of the
Spirit of God. Marvellous that we are still able
to see, under the microscope, the very first form
30 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
in which the Spirit of God manifested on the
earth.
3. Truly the glory of the Spirit of God is man­
ifest all about us. Truly we are very close to the
Spirit of God if we but realized that. But we shall
realize it before we close this book. For this book
will reveal the truths of the Spirit of God to
humanity, as the Spirit of God Itself has revealed
those truths to the writer, upon whom the Spirit
of God has seen fit to bring the pleasant task of
bringing its liberating truths, just at the period
in Time when hope seems to have fled.
4. But ’twas ever thus. For the Spirit of God
has lost none of Its intelligence. It has lost
none of the energy, the power, the initiative, the
resourcefulness, the creative ability of old. The
Spirit of God is still the Creator of all Life. It is
still the Master-Mind of the universe. Man may
refuse to understand the truths of the Spirit of
God. He may decide to try strange gods. He may
close his eyes to truths which are written upon
every page of the nature the Spirit of God pro­
vided. But inevitably when man does that he falls
into a pit so deep that it takes the Spirit of God
to get him out of it.
5. That has happened now. That is the reason
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 31
the Spirit of God has spoken through the author
of this book. Man, without God, has made a
hopeless mess of himself and the civilization in
which he lives. He has followed false prophets.
He has sought ways of his own, which ways are
not the ways of God. He has followed those who
would advocate philosophies of God which are
of their own manufacture.
6. He has listened to those who, in the name
of God, have closed every avenue whereby the
present Life and Power of the Spirit of God may
be made known to man. He has followed after
“gods” who, we have been told, violated the very
nature of the Spirit of God in their births. They
have sought to set at nought the plans which the
Spirit of God ordained should be the plans
through which this Spirit of Life could manifest
in the human race.
7. They would have humanity believe that, in
order to manifest Himself to man, God had to
break His own laws, thereby leaving the universe
hanging on chance and not on the Spirit of God.
For if the Spirit of God ever could break one of
Its own laws, It might do it again. But the Spirit
of God does not so operate. It does not operate
through priest or minister. It cannot operate
32 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
through theories of God which place the birth­
place of God in some human habitation, and the
birth of God within the last few thousand years.
8. It so happens that the Spirit of God is to
be found in every page of nature’s scroll. We can,
even now, see the very first form in which the
Spirit of God brought Life to the earth. How
foolish then to say that Almighty God, the Cre­
ator of the universe, was born by supernatural
means in the womb of a virgin who was a married
woman, some two thousand, or ten thousand
years ago.
9. These things it is which have brought man
to the depths of despair. These are the things
which have caused a great rift between God and
man. A rift so big that no one on the earth can
help humanity get out of the depths of despair,
and back close to God again.
10. But the Spirit of God is still mindful of
the man It created so many millions of ages ago.
It still remains the Only P ow er which can restore
man to God. And the Spirit of God has ordained
that the author of this book bring to humanity
the message it needs.
11. The Spirit of Life has seen fit to equip
the author with sufficient vision to be able to point
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 33
out the path which humanity must tread, if it is
to know the Spirit of God, and escape from the
terrible doom which its own foolish wars have
led it into.
12. No man can lead others to the Spirit of
God unless he himself knows the way. The way
to God does not lie in present-day theories of God
which cannot disclose the Power of God. We can­
not look to human religions for the truths of God.
But humanity has done just that. See where
humanity finds itself by doing so.
13. But this book will open the way back to
God. Through what is written herein, man may
come back to God. Man will find God whenever
he looks where God is. He cannot find God
through man-made systems of religion. And every
system of religion which teaches that God must
be found through it, is teaching falsity, and
falsity alone.
14. No system of theology discovered and de­
veloped by man can disclose the Spirit of God to
the human race. No Power other than the Power
of the Spirit of God can save humanity from itself
today. This is the reason the Spirit of God has
raised up the writer of this book—to bring man
back to God, and to bring peace and escape to a
34 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
humanity whose heart will bleed and suffer until
it finds God.
15. So far, we have found authentic informa­
tion about God in the rocks. The first forms of
life in which the Spirit of God appeared, are very
authentic. We know they existed, for the very
same forms of Life exist today. That is the story
the Spirit of God wrote, Man had nothing to do
with writing this story. So then, this book will
stay close by the known revelations of God to
humanity. It will find more and more truths
through what the Spirit of God wrote, than
through what man, in his religious fervor, imag­
ined were the truths of God.
16. Whenever the Spirit of God sends a true
prophet to earth to disclose Its truths, a period of
disruption must inevitably follow. For man, left
to himself without authentic knowledge of the
Spirit of God, will soon make a “god” of his own.
If the Power of the Spirit of God is unknown,
man will follow any leader who presumes to be
bringing and teaching what he considers to be,
religion. For man cannot get along very long
without God.
17. The revelation from God to you which
will be disclosed in this book, will be the first
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 35
direct revelation from the Spirit of God to man
since man, as such, has appeared on the earth.
It is the first time a prophet of God has been
ordained by God to bring the revealing truths of
God to a world which is slowly but surely getting
farther away from God. This revelation will be
the means of making the Spirit of God the most
realistic Power in millions of lives.
18. When the Proterozoic age ended, man
entered into the Paleozoic era. In this era, so-
called because of its relationship to “ancient life,”
we find that the Spirit of God has placed now,
on the earth, many different forms of life. In the
Paleozoic era, our geologists find a much better
state of preservation among the rocks, and there­
fore they have been able to read what the Spirit of
God wrote, far more clearly than in the earlier
eras.
19. Let us remember that we still are about
one billion years away from the present time. One
billion years back. Yet the Spirit of God, even
then, was writing a story which we today may
intelligently read. For the Spirit of God cannot
write anything that is not true. What, therefore,
is written upon the pages of nature by the Spirit
of God, the Creator of all nature, is true. We may
therefore, depend upon it. It must be the truths
of God. When these truths go opposite to human-
made systems of religion, the truths of God must
prevail.
20. There can be no religion higher than
truth. There can be no Power greater than the
Power of the Spirit of God, which made the
earth, and which wrote the story of creation in
the rocks. Shall we proceed to read the story.
21. Now it came to pass that the Spirit of God
desired to give to man, who, two billion years
later was to inhabit the earth, definite evidence
of the age of the earth. So the Spirit of God
placed in the rocks, certain minerals from which
the approximate age of the earth could be com­
puted. This the Spirit of God did by making it
known to man that it takes about five billion
years to break down uranium so that helium and
lead become half of the original uranium.
22. The age of the rocks then could be com­
puted from uranium. The handwriting of the
Spirit of God discloses to our geologists that the
oldest known rocks on the earth today are about
two billion years old.
23. The Spirit of God now leads us into the
next geologic era which is the Cambrian era. In
36 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 37
this era we find a great abundance of animal life
which the Spirit of God has preserved for us in
the rocks. Truly the manner in which the Spirit
of God reveals Itself to us is marvellous. The
ways of the Spirit of God are wondrous. For,
billions of years ago, long before man had been
more than a thought in the mind of the Spirit of
God, that great Spirit of all creation was writing
a story which all may read, and read truly. This
Spirit of God was telling us all about the days
when trilobites ruled the earth.
24. These trilobites were small sea animals.
Geologists call them trilobites because their bodies
are in three parts. These animals which the Spirit
of God had created, and which ruled the earth
a few billion years ago, were about one inch in
length. The Spirit of God so ordained it that
although it was billions of years since these little
animals ruled the earth, they may still be seen
today, where the Spirit of God put them for us
to see—in the rocks.
25. These trilobites became the lords of crea­
tion. There were more than a thousand different
kinds of them. They had eyes—they could see.
They had ears—they could hear. And the Life
which inhabited the inch-long bodies of these sea
38 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
animals was the only Life it could have been—
the Life which was then, and still is, the Spirit
of God.
26. From these trilobites, the Spirit of God
directed their growth into lobsters, spiders, centi­
pedes, and other forms of similar Life. It is many
millions of years since the last trilobite passed
away. But the Spirit of God wrote their true story
in the rocks. We can see those rocks today.
27. During the Cambrian period the moun­
tains and highlands which had been formed dur­
ing the previous eras were worn down, and the
seas crept further and further inland. It was dur­
ing this time that the trilobites inhabited the
earth. The seas then had been over the land where
we now live, known as America, for at least fifty
million years. They began to recede and the lands
appeared. We now live on the continent known
as North America. The Spirit of God, then,
millions and billions of years before our continent
was known, was, even then, writing the story I
am telling to you now, under the inspiration of
the Spirit of God.
28. It came then to pass that the Spirit of God
began to create other forms of life, and the geolo­
gists called the next era the Ordovician era. It
was in this period that the Spirit of God created
the cephalopods, or shell fish.
29. During the Ordovician period, much lime­
stone was formed by the Spirit of God, and in
that limestone the Creator wrote more for us to
read. The States of Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New
Jersey, and other southern states contain much
of the limestone which was formed during this
period in time, when the Spirit of God was
creating the limestone from which our Portland
cement is made today.
30. Now it came to pass that the Spirit of God
began the creation of the fishes in a period known
as Devonian. Age after age, progress after prog­
ress, still the Spirit of God was putting Its Life
into many and varied forms of Life. This con­
tinued for millions and billions of years, the Life
always being the same. Without the Spirit of
God, nothing was made that was made.
31. Then, one day, a geologist discovered a huge
footprint in a sand formation which had hardened
into a rock. The Spirit of God was writing again,
and man was given authentic information from
God about the first known footprint. The Spirit
of God was now manifesting in large animals
which had left their unmistakable traces for us
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 39
40 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
who want to know God to believe. When God
writes, even though it may not be what man
wanted God to write, it is better to believe it. For
what God writes is true. What man writes about
God is probably untrue. So the wise man and
woman will follow the handwriting God has left
for us to read. That cannot lead us astray.
32. At this time, the Spirit of God saw fit to
cause plants in the form of different kinds of
mossy life, to grow on the earth. As all Life must
come from the Author of all Life, the Spirit of
God, once more we understand how God placed
a little part of the Great Life which is in God,
in the plants too. Only a very small part. But God
nevertheless.
33. It is advisable here to remember that the
Spirit of God is an invisible Creative Spirit, never
seen by anyone. No man has ever seen God. None
ever will. For God is Life, capable of existence
without physical form, but at the same time being
able to manifest in a million different physical
forms at the same time, without in the least
detracting from the totality of God, the Creator
of everything that was made.
34. After the mosses, the Spirit of God created
the lichens and smaller plants, and imbedded
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 41
them in the coal beds of Pennsylvania and other
parts so that man, not yet upon the scene, might
read the story of how the Spirit of God created
the earth, and the order in which It created it.
The grasses too, the Spirit of God made them to
appear, and they have been growing upon the
earth from that day of first creation, millions and
perhaps billions of years ago until the present day.
35. Then the forests. The Spirit of God caused
them to appear, and it is in the rocks of the
Devonian period in New York that we have defi­
nite knowledge of the first trees. It will be well,
in studying the operations of the Spirit of God as
that great Spirit manifested throughout creation,
that knowledge of the first trees was obtained in
the rocks upon which God had written the mes­
sage, right here in the United States, in New
York State. This brings the creative ability of the
Spirit of God close home, does it not?
36. There is to be seen, in the State Museum
in Albany, N. Y., a reconstructed Devonian for­
est. Can you imagine man re-creating millions of
years later, the trees which grew upon the earth
when the Spirit of God first called trees into
being? And try and imagine the indefinite intelli­
gence the Spirit of God possessed when It left an
42 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
indelible signpost for man, who appeared mil­
lions of years later, to read. Truly God is a Spirit
of wonderful intelligence, power, ingenuity, per­
severance, and creative ability.
37. When these Devonian forests were grow­
ing, there were no green leaves upon the trees. No
birds sang and built their nests in their branches.
For the Spirit of God had not yet caused the birds
to be. The fishes in the sea, the great animals, the
ferns, lichens, and forests, but no bird life at this
point. Yet the creation so far had taken millions
of ages to perfect to its incomplete state. And the
Spirit of God gave Life to every created form of
Life on the earth.
38. There was no other cause of Life. None
other possessed Life. None other could give Life.
So the Spirit of God, the Infinite Creator of the
universe, gave freely of Itself in order that the
world might come into being.
39. Sometimes a fish, thrust upon the land,
would develop wings with which to fly. It would
also develop lungs. So great was the indwelling
Spirit of God in that fish that the Life of it, or
the Life of God in the fish, had sufficient ability
to create whatever organs were necessary to the
life of the fish. Truly unlimited power and ability
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 43
is possessed by the Spirit of God, the Creator of
everything. The man to follow must be a truly
remarkable man. For if the Spirit of God could
do so much for the lower forms of Life, how much
more can that Spirit do for man, Its very highest
creation.
40. It was in this Devonian period that the
Spirit of God placed large quantities of tin, and
iron, and other metals in the belly of the earth.
For this Spirit knew that man, coming millions
of years later, would have need of these metals
and minerals. So the Spirit of God, ever mindful
of man, even before he had been created, made
provision for the supreme comfort of man. Wise
God—wise indeed. So far-sighted, too.
41. Yet God, even through this marvelous
creative period, was always and ever an invisible
Spirit of Life. The works of God may be seen, but
God—never. At no time did the totality of the
Spirit of God ever appear on the earth or any­
where else in human form. Man, appearing later,
originated that theory of God. It is not true, as
we shall see as the Spirit of God continues to
unfold Its operations through this book, and its
author, who is drawing his inspiration direct from
the invisible Spirit of God.
44 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
42. Glass, too. The Spirit of God showed man,
much later on, how to make glass. It was used in
Italy thousands of years ago. And the Spirit of
God looked upon Its creation so far, and pro­
nounced it good.
CHAPTER FOUR
1. It is about 350,000,000 years ago, and
the Spirit of God has nowhere near finished Its
creation of the earth. Yet It has abundantly dem­
onstrated what a marvelous creative ability It
possesses. The creation is even more wonderful as
it happened than if it had been instantly done. For
the Spirit of God the Creator is a very slow-mov­
ing Spirit. When an emergency exists, It can
speed up Its created processes. But with millions
of eons of time, the Spirit of God worked very
slowly in the creation of the universe.
2. Geologists have given the name “Carboni­
ferous” to the next era of time. This, because
during this period the great coal deposits of Penn­
sylvania and other places were formed.
3. Now in Its infinite wisdom, the Spirit of
God knew that It was to create man, so It care­
fully paved the way for man, by placing in the
earth vast beds of coal. This coal the human race,
when it came, could burn to keep it warm.
4. We of the twentieth century are quite fa­
miliar with the “appalachian” coal-fields of the
46 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
Atlantic coast. But we seldom remember that the
Spirit of God, some 350,000,000 or more years
ago, was at work creating these coal-beds that
man may be made warm during the cold weather
which the Spirit of God had ordained should
alternate with the warm weather on the earth.
5. The Spirit of God, at about this time, be­
gan to create the larger fishes. It had already
created the smaller fresh water fishes. Now it
turned Its creative energy and ability to further
populating the seas. So God, in infinite creative
ability, created the sharks, a boneless species of
large fish. These sharks survived the ages, and we
still have them with us today.
6. Once more Almighty God left a record for
man to read, for we are even now, 350,000,000
years later, discovering the fossilized remains of
these early sharks. They speak with the voice of
authority. Man knows scientifically approxi­
mately how old the earth is. He reads the story
the Spirit of God wrote in the rocks. And he
knows too, approximately how long ago it was
when the Spirit of God changed Its creations, or
added new creations to them.
7. Let it be remembered once again that the
only Author and Creator of all Life was the
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 47
Spirit of God. This Spirit lives, in part, in the
form of every living thing. Life, without the
Creator of Life, would be an impossibility. Wher­
ever one sees Life, one may safely and accurately
say that this Life, in totality, came in the begin­
ning from the Creator of all forms of Life—the
Spirit of the invisible God.
8. Scientists are also able to determine the dif­
ferent sizes of the differing creations of the Spirit
of God. For God wrote this evidence plainly in
the rocks. The intelligence of God must indeed be
marvelous. There is no other Creator like the
God of the universe. Unlimited in power, wis­
dom, judgment, ingenuity, and resourcefulness,
it can, without consulting man or any of Its other
creations, bring into existence the most wonderful
and amazing things. And they all have their
origin in the Spirit of God. It is good then, that
when we human beings see the handiwork of the
Spirit of God, we might stand and give thanks to
such a creative Spirit.
9. So limitless its Power. So abundantly able
to create out of Itself, anything and everything
It desires to create. What a wonderful Spirit we
are dealing with. The author is very happy that
the Spirit of God has seen fit to reveal Its won­
48 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
derful works to humanity in the twentieth cen­
tury through him.
10. The Spirit of God, desiring that the race
of people to be known as Americans would like
to be able to see something of the wonders of the
Spirit of God, created large caves in which man
may stand, and there see how many millions of
ages it took the Creator to bring Its creation to
perfection. So the Spirit of God created the
Mammoth caves of Kentucky.
11. Here, in these caves, man may truly see
the handiwork of God. The Grand Canyon of the
Colorado. There too is the handiwork of God.
Crater Lake in Oregon, is just outside of Klamath
Falls, the Spirit of God gave to us Americans
another wonderful example of Its creative ability.
12. There one may wander through the Gar­
den of the Gods, so very properly named. There
too, man may stand in awe as he gazes upon the
creative beauty of Crater Lake, as it came direct
to man from the hand of the Spirit of God. For
there is no other Creator. The earth was created
by the Spirit of God. None helped. None needed
to. For the Spirit of God is an all-sufficient Spirit.
It can create without limit.
13. Deep down among the Kentucky caves,
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 49
man can walk and wonder as he sees the fantastic
shapes which Almighty God was creating mil­
lions of years ago. The immense stalactites, and
stalagmites—there they stand, all mute but elo­
quent testimony of the creative ability of the
Spirit of God.
14. Fishes swim in the small lakes in those
caves. They have no eyes. They need none. If
those fishes were transferred to a lake where the
daylight can shine upon it, the Spirit of God
would provide them with eyes. But down deep
in the bowels of the earth, it is dark. Therefore
the Spirit of God did not waste any of Its creation
by placing eyes in fishes that had no need for
them. Wise Creator. Man may depend very
surely upon such wisdom.
15. Now it came to pass that the waters which
had covered most of the earth, except in the high
places, began to recede. This was approximately
300,000,000 years ago. At that date, what we
now call America was covered with water, ex­
cept in a few places. It is wrong to state that
Columbus discovered America. It was created by
the Spirit of God. Therefore, the Spirit of God
is both Creator and Discoverer of America.
16. Now the Spirit of God began to lay the
50 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
foundation for the vast coal-beds mentioned in
the last chapter of this Word of God. There were
large swampy areas from which the waters re­
ceded slowly. The ground remained marshy. Let
it be remembered here that forests and plants
grew all over the land.
17. Before the Spirit of God caused forests
and plants to grow on the earth It was creating,
there was no coal. There was need for none. Man
had not yet been created and would not be for
many millions of years. Yet the Spirit of God,
ever mindful of the needs of man, was preparing
these huge coal-beds, the largest in the world,
that man might find comfort from the chilling
winds which the Spirit of God also created.
18. Scientists and geologists tell us that it took
about fifty million years for the Spirit of God to
create these coal beds. One cannot help but stand
amazed at the wisdom of God, Who, fifty million
years ago, began to prepare for the man It was
shortly to bring to earth. Man burns up in one
hour what it took the Spirit of God fifty million
years to produce, and man thinks nothing of it.
Short-sighted man fights and squabbles among
himself as to the wages to be paid for mining the
coal which took the Spirit of God so very long
to create.
19. Yet God is ever mindful of man. But man
is not mindful of God. Some foolish men, in the
light of the evidence which abounds everywhere,
are foolish enough to think that Almighty God,
the supreme Creator of everything, was Itself
born here on the earth a few thousand years ago.
20. It is little wonder that man is so very
far away from the Spirit of God, his Creator. Not
until man learns something different about God
will man be able to enjoy the blessings the Spirit
of God has placed here for his pleasure and his
needs. The Creator of the universe was not born
of a woman two thousand or ten thousand years
ago.
21. The Great Spirit of God, millions and
millions of ages ago, long before It had ever de­
cided to make man, was already preparing the
earth for the coming of man. Yet there are good-
intentioned souls on the earth who tell the human
race if it does not believe that Almighty God was
born of a virgin two, or ten thousand years ago,
Almighty God will cast man out, either into hell
or into outer darkness.
22. It is false theories of God which are hid­
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 51
52 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
ing the truths of God from the human race.
These false theories are the direct cause of the
bloodshed and wholesale murder which man is
committing on the wonderful earth God spent
millions of ages preparing for man.
23. It is very evident then that man has wan­
dered a long way from God. It is to bring man
back to God that he has inspired this prophet of
God to tell man what the actual relationship be­
tween man and God really is. It shall come to
pass that when man-made theories of God are
all cast aside, man shall live in perfect peace and
harmony with the Spirit of God which created
the earth for man, and then created man to live
upon the earth.
24. The lichens, mosses, and ferns from which
Almighty God created the coal for man to burn,
grew in dense profusion here in America hun­
dreds of millions of years ago. The Spirit of God
caused them so to grow, that they might decom­
pose, and be changed into coal for man to bum.
25. So the hand of God, through a very long
but very orderly process, created the Pennsylvania
and Atlantic coal-beds, for man’s use. The bac­
teria which the Spirit of God created, caused
the decomposition, so the hand of God was in
every act of the creation of this coal.
26. It came to pass in those days, that the
Spirit of God also created insects, and other ani­
mals which fly. Three hundred and fifty million
years ago, immense dragon-flies, having wing-
spread of over thirty inches flew over the earth.
The Spirit of God created those dragon flies. The
process of their creation covered a long period,
but these immense dragon-flies had Life, so they
came from the Giver of all Life, the Spirit of
God.
27. Cockroaches also were there. The Spirit
of God created them too, and left man a com­
plete record of their size in the rocks. Some of the
modern systems of theology which man, far away
from God, originated, claim that Almighty God
had nothing to do with man-made systems of
theology. What the Spirit of God did do was to
write the story of Its creative ability in the rocks.
28. That record may be read by any who will.
It was written by God. It pales into significance
the puny theories of man, who actually believes
that Almighty God was so impotent that it took
the death of Almighty God, the creator of the
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 53
54 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
universe, on a cross, to appease the wrath of an
angry God.
29. God never gets angry at man. God, the in­
visible Spirit of all Creation, has no anger in Its
make-up. It cannot have. The work of the Spirit
of God is to create and keep creating. Thus will
it ever be. If man chooses to ignore the handiwork
of God—if man chooses to make unto himself
other “gods,” the Spirit of God is not interested.
That is only abundant evidence that man is still
a long way from God.
30. The return of man to God is a matter for
man alone. God will not go out of the way, nor
will this Great Spirit reverse or hasten the
method of creation, just because man has seen fit
to ignore the true God, and make unto himself
idols. The time will have to come when man, of
his own free will, returns to God. When man
does, he will find that as always, there is an
abundance of every good thing to be found in the
Spirit of God.
31. For the Spirit of God cannot withhold
any good thing from those who have learned the
secret of the invisible existence of the Spirit of
God, and, knowing that existence in their lives,
freely and willingly draw upon the fathomless
ocean of power, wisdom, resourcefulness, peace,
ingenuity which is the Spirit of God.
32. Man has gotten a very long way from
God. Man went away of his own free will. If
man ever returns, it will be of his own free will.
It is quite possible for man to completely exter­
minate himself from the earth. Some of God’s
other creations have done that. But that is nothing
to God, whom, in spite of anything man can do,
will continue to create and create, if necessary
creating another man who will recognize the
marvels of the existence of the Spirit of Life, or
God, in him.
33. When the waters receded from some parts
of the earth, some of the fishes were left on land.
Did they die? No— for the Spirit of God taught
them how to breathe air. It created lungs in them.
It taught them to walk. Some of the species can
still live in water or on land, either one. Man
calls this species amphibians, because they can
live either on land or in the water.
34. Frogs, toads, etc. We see these animals
today. But man forgets that the Spirit of God
caused them to change from fishes over 350,000,-
000 years ago. Truly great are the works of the
Spirit of God.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 55
56 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
35. As the trilobites of a few million years
past became the rulers of the earth, the Spirit of
God ordained that these grown fishes and am­
phibians also, for a period of time, rule the earth.
36. Had it not been for the Spirit of God
showing Its infinite wisdom so very long ago, our
present civilization could not be. Without coal,
without rocks, without minerals and metals man
would be severely handicapped. But the Spirit of
God knew all this millions of ages ago, and made
provision for the needs of man. Now, we see man
murdering himself and bathing the earth with
blood. And all this because man is living in com­
plete and total ignorance of the existence of the
Spirit of God in him.
37. For the same Life which was given to all
other forms of creation, was also given to man.
There is but one Creator. There can be only one
Spirit of God. So then, that Spirit gave Its own
life to man as It gave that Life to the animals,
the birds, the bees, the flowers, and every other
living form of life.
38. We shall discover later the difference,
which was not in quality but in quantity. The
Life however is the same. It all came from the
One Creator of the universe—the Spirit of God.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 57
39. Now it was about this period when the
Spirit of God formed the mountains, which, later
on were to bring to man such a pleasure. They
were all formed for man’s benefit. For God knew
that the man he would create would be in need of
the comforts which the earth can bring. So God
created the mountains over a period of time
which our geologists estimate to be over a hun­
dred million years.
40. Mount Whitney, Mount Tamalpais,
Mount Rainier near Seattle, these and scores of
other mountains and mountain ranges were all
brought into being by the Spirit of God, who
caused them to appear as volcanoes first.
41. Now it came to pass that the Spirit of God
had created this earth after its surface had become
cool, the center of the earth still being hot and
molten. In order to produce the mountains, the
Spirit of God caused volcanoes to erupt, and the
mountains to appear.
42. It was in this period that the Spirit of God
caused these great revolutions which were to
make the earth so much more beautiful for man
to live on. Some of these volcanoes are still active.
This prophet stood on Mt. Vesuvius in Italy a
58 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
few years ago. There, he saw the handiwork of
the Spirit of God.
43. So awed was he by this handiwork, and so
close to him did the Spirit of God come, that he
stood there, hat in hand, and praised the Spirit of
God for Its amazing creative ability and beauty.
He always does that. He is very joyful because
the Spirit of God has revealed to him what the
truths of God are, and has made him the medium
through which these truths are to become known
to this dying, struggling human race.
44. What a pity that something happened to
take man’s eyes away from the Spirit of God.
What a pity that the man who the Spirit of God
created, began to look for other “gods,” just be­
cause the Creator of the Universe is an invisible
Spirit. What a pity theological perverts told man
that any “god” it could not see could not be the
true God. What a pity man ever forgot that God
always must be the invisible Spirit of Life.
45. There was never need for God to be seen.
The operations of the Spirit of God are silent
and unseen. The Spirit of God is also silent and
unseen. It is an impossibility for anyone to see
God in physical form. They who are pure in
mind and thought—they who know something
of the spiritual nature of the Spirit of God—they
can see God, but never as a physical being.
46. If the Spirit of God ever became, in total­
ity, a material being, this universe would dissolve
overnight. For it is the invisible Life and Power
of the invisible Spirit of God which keeps it for
ever revolving in limitless space. Here is the rea­
son why religions made by man, without the Spirit
of God in them, must always bring the world to
the disaster which faces it in the twentieth cen­
tury. It cannot be otherwise. The Spirit of God
hath spoken it.
47. And the Spirit of God created the winds
and the waves. And it created them to make the
earth beautiful for man. Many of earth’s most
beautiful spots were created by the Spirit of God
through the wind and the waves.

CHAPTER FIVE
1. Now IT CAME TO PASS THAT ABOUT THE END
of the Paleozoic era, the Spirit of God saw fit to
place on the earth a creation of strange contrast
to any It had seen fit to make before. Up to this
time there had been no land animals, only the
amphibians which the Spirit of God gave lungs
to in order that they might be able to live both
on land and in the sea.
2. But now, the Spirit of God brought to
earth immense reptiles. They were interesting
and spectacular creatures, crawling over the sur­
face of the earth. Here again, as usual, the Spirit
of God wrote Its message to man in the rocks and
under the ground.
3. Many of these land reptiles were fierce to
look upon, and never were looked upon by man.
For the Spirit of God had not yet created man.
We have, however, remnants of these monsters
with us today. We know them as lizards, croco­
diles, snakes. These are the last remaining de­
scendants of what was once a very powerful
reptile kingdom. They outlived their usefulness
and passed away.
4. Those left are decreasing in size, and the
next million years will eliminate them all. There
is no good purpose left for them to fulfill. So the
Spirit of God will see that they are eliminated.
5. The Spirit of God desired man to know
of the existence of these huge animals, so It
caused to be preserved in the Grand Canyon,
footprints in the rocks, which prints have been
there for over 250,000,000 years. Truly the
Spirit of God is great. Truly man can rest with
complete assurance in such an invisible Spirit.
6. Then the Spirit of God, about this same
time, caused the reptiles to appear on the earth.
Here again, in Texas, the story was written by
the Spirit of God, and there it has been read, and
there it can still be read by those who wish to
read it.
7. The first known reptiles were about three
feet long and had a tail about half that length.
They were fierce looking animals, and undoubt­
edly were from a prior creation which was am­
phibian. The Spirit of God, however, in Its in­
finite wisdom, saw fit to create those reptiles, if
for no other purpose than to show man what the
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 61
62 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
processes of creation as followed by the Spirit of
God really were.
8. After man had appeared on the earth, and
when religionists came, stories were circulated
that 6000 years ago, Almighty God formed man
from the dust of the earth. One instantaneous
creation. Then, so these religionists tell us, God
took a rib from out of the man and made a
woman. And all this happened only 6000 years
ago. This is presumed to be authentic, for the
actual date is to be found in the marginal note
of the first verse of a Bible which is called by
man “Christian.” Naturally, the story must be
false, so the Spirit of God can have had nothing
to do with the story nor with the book in which
the story appears.
9. The story, however, forms the basis for one
of the earth’s present eleven systems of religion,
all of which are man-made systems of religion,
and they do not contain the truths of God as the
Spirit of God has given the story to man.
10. Now this false story of the time of the
creation of the earth came into the Christian
Bible in a very strange manner. It so happened
that there lived in Ireland, a man who was con­
sidered to be a “holy-man.” He was the Bishop
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 63
of Armagh. He read the man-made book called
the Christian Bible, the writing of which the
Spirit of God had nothing to do with.
11. The story of creation as it happened was
written by the Spirit of God millions of ages ago,
on the rocks. It can be read on every page of the
creation today.
12. Well, it came to pass that this “holy-man”
studied a book which the Christian religion had
originated over a period of many years, and by
studying this book, the “holy-man” in Ireland
decided that at 9 a. m. October 26th, 4004 B.C.,
God created the entire universe. That would
make it about 5900 years from the beginning of
creation to the present time.
13. The statement is considered authentic or
it would not appear in a book which the Christian
religion thinks to be the “Holy Word” of God.
Of course, the book is nothing of the sort as we
shall see later.
14. It is man-made theories of the smallness
of God which have led the human race to the
very door of destruction. Had the Spirit of God
in man been known, and had man been content
to listen to God instead of listening to “holy-
men,” the present war could not have been. We
64 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
shall return to man at a later date, so shall pass
on to the creation of the reptiles at this point.
15. Now it came to pass that the Spirit of God
created reptiles having what we may call “sails”
which were elongations of the backbones of these
reptiles. These creatures were from ten to fifteen
feet long, and looked very fierce. The Life which
inhabited their bodies however came from the
Source of all Life, the Spirit of God. For none
other could create Life in any form. So the crea­
tion of these reptiles was good, for the Spirit of
God always operates for the good of man.
16. The glory and Power of the Spirit of God
is manifest in a million different ways, and these
reptiles were living evidences of the creative abil­
ity of the Spirit of God. For God is the only
Spirit that can create. God is the only Spirit that
can give life to anyone or anything.
17. So then, every created thing, whether
man knows its primary object or not, was created
by the invisible Spirit of all creation, Almighty
God, your Creator and mine.
18. Many were the fights which occurred, as
fossilized remains of these reptiles show to this
day the marks of conflict. Truly the Spirit of God
was very anxious for you and me to know just
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 65
how long it did take It to bring creation to its
present state. These reptiles have been re-created
from fossilized bones and we know with certainty
just about what they looked like. Now there was
no other Creator but God. These reptiles were
not haphazard. Nor were they useless. The Spirit
of God created them and there was an object
sufficiently important to the Spirit of God.
19. Never could these animals and reptiles
engage in such a bloody slaughter as man is wag­
ing with his fellow-men on the earth today. Most
assuredly the existence of the Spirit of God in
man is a fact that no religion can teach to man.
It is the absence of true knowledge of the Spirit
of God which is causing man to become lower
than these prehistoric animals of so long ago.
20. “Holy-men” whose religions teach that
God created the earth and man 6000 years ago,
cannot have the answer for they do not know
God. If they knew God, they would not make
such foolish statements as they have made and
inserted in their “holy-books.” The Spirit of God
writes Its own story. What It writes is true. Even
though every religion on the face of the earth has
to go into the discard, what God writes on the
rocks is true.
■ 66 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
21. Never, during the infinite creation, did
the Spirit of God falter in Its creative activities.
Never did it go to sleep. Being God, this Great
Spirit cannot become tired with Its labors. It can­
not sleep. There are legends concerning the crea­
tion which say that Almighty God created the
heavens and the earth in six days, and then rested
on the seventh.
22. Obviously such are but legends, man-con­
ceived and made. The God who created this uni­
verse neither slumbers nor sleeps. The slow work
of creation ever progresses. Silently, effectively,
the Spirit of God even now is creating for man, a
far better place for him to live. That place will
not be available however until man returns to
God. Idols, and myths and legends which origi­
nated in dark-age times, must be shown for what
they are.
23. When this is done, man will, for the first
time since his creation, be glad to return to the
Spirit of God which created him, and which can
bring him the abundance of material and spiritual
supply man craves for.
24. For the Spirit of God exists for that pur­
pose. Man, left alone with God, and without false
ideas of God, will speedily return to the Spirit of
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 67
God, where he will find his life was really meant
to be. It was ever the purpose of God to urge
man to stay close by God. False theologies caused
man to wander away.
25. But humanity has sunk so low now, and
the human race is murdering itself at such a rate
that unless the brutal slaughter stops before too
long, there will be little left for man.
26. In this case, the Spirit of God will prob­
ably create another man.
27. This later man will not allow legends and
myths to come between him and the Spirit of God.
28. Now the Spirit of God created Flying-
Dragons, and wrote the history of them in the
rocks, where investigating intelligent man, re­
turning to the Creator by using his God-given
intelligence, might find them. And the investi­
gating man, not satisfied with the current legends
about God, took note of what the Spirit of God
had written in the rocks.
29. Because of what the Spirit of God wrote,
man may now find his way back to the Spirit of
God.
30. The Spirit of God recorded the existence
of the Flying-Dragons in the rocks of the Meso­
zoic period. These creatures were called Ptero­
dactyls, and were much larger than any flying
animal of today. The Spirit of God placed Its
Life in those Flying-Dragons, and caused them
to fly. The same Spirit gives Life, and the power
to fly to the blue-birds, the sparrows, the robins,
and every other form of flying-life today. Great
is the power of the Spirit of God.
31. Scientists have told us that the wing-
spread of these Flying-Dragons was over thirty
feet. They were greater than other beings able to
fly, except man, who, because the Spirit of God
is in him is able to make machines which can out-
fly any animal or bird. These flying-machines
man is now using to ruthlessly murder his fellow-
men. He drops bombs of explosives on his fellow-
men and blasts them into eternity. The Ptero­
dactyls of millions of years ago did not do that.
But man, through the creative ability of the Spirit
of God in him, turns this ability into destruction.
32. These Flying-Dragons were a species of
what we know as the hat today. The Spirit of God
gives Life to the Bat. It also gives Life to you and
me. Vast possibilities are in the Life which is
God in us.
33. It behooved the Spirit of God at this
time, to create sea-serpents. The Spirit of God
68 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
was manifesting Its creative ability in divers
ways. No human being has ever seen a sea-ser­
pent. But the Spirit of God gave man the record
to read. And man has read the record. Man knows
something about the processes through which the
creation went through the power of the Spirit of
God, the Creator of the universe.
34. Many and varied were the creations of the
Spirit of God during the Mesozoic and Cretace­
ous periods. Many were the evidences of the su­
perability of the Spirit of God to create anything
and everything this Great Spirit chose to create.
We cannot scan the works of God without being
silenced into amazement. The wise man of today
will realize that the Spirit of God, the Creator
of the universe, gave him life also.
35. Now the Spirit of God ordained that
whole forests should become petrified, that man
may have authentic knowledge of their existence,
millions of years ago. God did not turn all the
forests into coal. He left tangible concrete evi­
dence for man to read. This evidence shows the
overwhelming Power of the Spirit of the Crea­
tive God. And man has read the record.
36. Faith is not needed to believe in God. Evi­
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 69
70 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
dence is better than faith. God Almighty pro­
vided the evidence. So faith may be forgotten.
37. Quite often this prophet of God drives to
Ginkgo Park, and wanders through these evi­
dences of petrified forests which the Spirit of God
ordained should be left right there, by the side of
the road, for all to see the handiwork of the Cre­
ator. It is good. We see and read the message. We
know what God created for God showed us. We
believe in that God.
CHAPTER SIX
1. W e come now to the age when the
Spirit of God created the Dinosaurs. In the year
1802 A.D. a farmer in Connecticut was plough­
ing his field. The plough turned up the tracks of
a Dinosaur. Later, men of science, their minds
illumined by the Spirit of God, read the story
God had written in those tracks. Almost two hun­
dred different kinds of these tracks were discov­
ered by the scientists and geologists who knew the
handwriting of God when they saw it.
2. For the handwriting of God is always the
story of creation.
3. These tracks, and the bones later discov­
ered, probably have lain in their resting place for
two hundred millions of years, and perhaps
longer. But the Spirit of God saw to it that they
were left somewhere, for God knew what strange
idols man would make of God. And the Spirit of
God wanted the truth to become known, before
man completely annihilated himself from the
face of the earth. And so, millions, and perhaps
billions of years ago after the Dinosaurs trod the
72 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
earth, man discovers the handiwork of God in
them.
4. In the State of Utah there is a park called
Dinosaur Park. There may be seen the actual
bones discovered in the rocks, and placed there
millions of years ago by the Spirit of God.
5. Some of these Dinosaurs weighed forty to fifty
tons, yet they were brainless. Nevertheless, that is
the way the Spirit of Life created them, and left
the record for man, millions of years later, to see.
6. Then followed the Tyrannosaurus and other
ferocious beasts, all created by the Spirit of God,
and all deriving their Life from God. There was
none other capable of giving Life.
7. Then came the Brontosaurus which at­
tained a length of seventy-five feet. And God left
a record of this monster too. And man, beginning
to think about the greatness of God, painstakingly
uncovered the record the Spirit of God had left
for him to read. Always in the rocks or the sand.
Never in any other manner.
8. After God made the Dinosaurs and the
other large monsters, It turned Its creative ability
to birds. And today we see these birds, originally
created millions of years ago, still flying round us
and filling the air with their song.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 73
9. Millions upon millions of years after the
Spirit of God created the first of the bird family,
a farmer in Bavaria was excavating in a quarry
of limestone, when he discovered there a fossil­
ized bird. That fossilized bird had been created
by the Spirit of God, and had been placed there
to be discovered by man millions upon millions of
years later. Great is the wisdom of the Spirit of
God. Great indeed.
10. From those early birds came all bird life.
Neither man, nor time, nor anything else has
been able to eradicate it. Birds have not yet out­
lived their usefulness, so the Spirit of God con­
tinues their existence.
11. How long—oh Spirit of God, will you
continue the existence of man if he persists in
ignoring you, and turning instead to man-made
idols?
12. Then the Spirit of God began the creation
of huge masses of shells from which chalk is
made. This was called the Cretaceous period. And
the same Spirit of Life, the Spirit of God, once
more left indelibly marked along the trail of time,
fresh evidences of the handiwork of God. The
chalk cliffs of England are composed of millions
and billions of these tiny creatures, which the
74 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
Spirit of God created millions of years ago. Yet
in England people walk daily over those chalk
cliffs, never giving a thought to the creative
ingenuity of the Spirit of God which created the
cliffs upon which they walk. Many of these good
folks are looking for some manifestation from
God to come from the sky. It cannot come that
way. If they will look under their feet, they will
see absolute evidence of the creative power of the
Spirit of God. If they would look inside them­
selves they would see there too, much evidence
of the existence of the Spirit of God. But man
has been too much concerned with legends and
myths concerning God to look for God where
God is.
13. Not until man looks for God where God
is can man find God. But the Spirit of God may
be found very easily if man will only look where
that Spirit exists. For It does exist. It is the most
dynamic, creative Power in this universe today.
No need for anyone to look to “heaven” for God.
No need for any to die in order to find God.
14. If the Spirit of God did not live in our
Life, we could not live. Yet men and women pre­
fer their theological idols to the existence of the
Spirit of God. Those idols will lead mankind to
destruction. The Spirit of God will lead man to
eternal Life.
15. It is interesting to note that through all
the marvellous creations which the Spirit of God
has wrought, they have all been achieved in
silence, complete and absolute. Not a sound did
the Spirit of God make all through those billions of
ages. Not a word was spoken. The manifestations
of the Spirit of God, and the creations of the Spirit
of God always are shrouded in complete silence.
16. When a baby is born, it begins to cry. But
the creation of the baby and its building opera­
tions are in complete silence. It is only in com­
plete silence the Spirit of God can create. For
God only operates in silence. The manifestations
and the creations of the Spirit of God may be
among the noisiest in the world. But they were
created in silence.
17. So, in complete silence, the Spirit of God
gave birth to the flower kingdom. Here again the
Spirit of God ordained that fossils remain as a
witness to the creative ability of the Spirit of God
in the flower kingdom.
18. This evidence is to be found in the States
of Dakota, both North and South. Strange, with
flowers blooming all round us, the Spirit of God
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 75
7 6 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
wanted us to know how many millions of years
have passed since the first flowers were created.
The ways of God always seem strange to those
who know not God. Those who do know God,
discover that the ways of the Spirit of God are
ways of deep silence and infinite peace.
19. There is no peace on the earth today. The
way of God is not known. Many theologies have
hoped to point out the way, but they have failed.
They have not read the lessons the Spirit of God
left for man to read.
20. The Spirit of God has left evidence with
us that it took this Creative Spirit millions and
billions of years to create this universe. But theol­
ogy insists on claiming that about 6000 years ago,
God formed man from the dust of the ground,
then took one of his ribs away and formed a
woman. This, it puts in its “holy-book.” It is not
true, therefore the “holy-books” are not true.
They do not reveal the Spirit of God to man.
21. After the flowers, the Spirit of God cre­
ated the snakes, which are lizards which have lost
their legs. Those who look to what is known as
“religion” for God, are told that the Creator of
this universe grew angry because a talking-snake
had upset the divine apple-cart, and, in a moment
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 77
of rage, the Almighty cursed the snake and caused
it to lose its legs. This, is what we have been asked
to believe in as being of God. This is the reason
men are at war with each other today. Only when
the actual truths of God are revealed to humanity,
will wars cease and man find God. It was the
Spirit of God that gave life to the snake. How
then could God rise in anger against Its own
creation?
22. About seventy-five million years ago, the
Spirit of God brought the mammal kingdom into
existence. In them, too, It placed Its own Life.
It gave a small portion of Its overflowing Life,
and thereby It gave Life to all mammals.
23. Yet the Great Life which is God did not
detract from Itself. For the nature of God is
always creative. The Life which is God is abun­
dantly able to transmit Itself to other forms, and
grow in them. The Spirit of God will grow and
manifest to the very full in whatever form of
Life It may choose to reside in.
24. The elephants, and other mammals were,
up to this period of the creation, the most intelli­
gent of all God’s creation. They too grew in form
and stature. The Spirit of God in them developed
them, and will continue to develop them until
78 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
they have served no further useful purpose. Then,
the Spirit of God, or the Life of God, will be
withdrawn from them. They will become extinct.
25. The thing for mail to watch out for is
that the Creator will not withdraw suddenly Its
Life from the human race. The prophet of God
wonders oft-times why the Spirit of God is so
patient with man. He wonders what is the reason
for such patience.
26. For the Spirit of God knows what the
human race is doing to itself today. It knows that
the most marvellous of all God’s creation is ruth­
lessly destroying itself. Yet the Spirit of God still
continues to give Life to man. For how long?
God alone knows.
27. Man today is not proving his worthiness
to have the Spirit of Life living in his body.
Perhaps the Spirit of God w ill withdraw It.
28. Some of the mammals God created lay
eggs, like the duck-bill. Others, like the kangaroo,
have pockets in which they carry their young.
For in all forms of animal life, the Spirit of God
created them male and female. It gave unto them
the ability to reproduce their kind.
29. It is into this class that our common horse
belongs. That friendly animal many have grown
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 79
to love. Yet the Spirit of God created the first
horse probably one hundred million years ago.
Ages coming after this will also be able to read
in the rocks the evidence that God created animals
known as horses.
30. Millions of years may elapse, but the rec­
ord of what the Spirit of God created will be left
for others to read.
Book Two
CHAPTER ONE
1. NOW, THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAD FINISHED
the creation of the earth upon which we live. It
had looked upon Its handiwork. It had pro­
nounced it good. True, it had taken the Spirit of
God hundreds of billions of years, but that means
little when compared to eternity. There is no
time in eternity. Neither is there time in the
Spirit of God.
2. For God is time. God is eternity. And even
though the creation had taken millions and bil­
lions of what we call “years,” it was but as a split
second of time to the Spirit of God which Spirit
knows no time. For no one created the Spirit of
God. It has existed from all eternity and will
exist to, and through all eternity. Neither time
nor space exist in the Realm of the Spirit of God.
They cannot, for God is everything.
3. Throughout the billions of ages which had
elapsed, the Spirit of God had been noiselessly,
silently creating. With infinite ability, infinite
ingenuity, infinite creativeness, infinite skill, the
invisible Spirit of God, the Creator of all man­
84 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
kind, had been slowly fashioning out of what
must have originally been nothing, through the
Power of the Invisible Spirit of God, the earth
as it then was.
4. Before this time, throughout all eternity,
covering a period of more years than the human
mind can conceive, this same Spirit of Life had
done the same creative things, perhaps billions
of times before. For there, above, hung the stars.
They still hang there, and they still radiate the
infinite wisdom and power of the Spirit which
created them. Mute, but eloquently they swing in
their orbits with ceaseless precision.
5. No help from man was needed or desired
by the Spirit of God. Man was not then formed.
Nor was he formed for billions of ages later. The
vast firmament on high, with its multitudes of
sparkling stars which in reality are suns giving
light to billions of other worlds, all these were
created by the Spirit of God over a period of
time too vast for man to grasp, if man insists
on thinking in terms of time when dealing with
the things of God.
6. Now the earth was completed. Life of every
kind and sort dwelt on the earth. Every conceiv­
able kind of animal, too. The Spirit of God had
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 85
over countless ages, and yet in a split second, cre­
ated them all. For countless ages are but as a split
second with God.
7. So God decided to make man. He decided
to crown the marvellous work It had finished
with a crowning glory—Man. For the idea of
Man had always been in the mind of the Spirit
of God. All the various earths God had created
were created with but one object. That was—
the coming of man to the earth.
8. So the spirit of God had already provided
for man, an abundance of everything man could
need for his sojourn on the marvellous earth God
had created for him.
9. And God said to Himself: “I will make
man in my own image. I will put My life into
him as I put it into the animals and flowers. But,
unlike the animals, the fishes, the birds, and the
flowers, I will give to man My Spirit—the Spirit
of Infinite Life, and all that entails, without meas­
ure. I will give the earth to man and he shall
have complete dominion over it. He shall have
dominion over every created thing which I have
created upon the earth.”
10. And the Spirit of God did make man. It
made man in the image of God, after the likeness
8 6 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
of God. The Spirit of God, in order to carry out
Its expressed wishes, gave, therefore, unto man,
the same creative ability God possessed. It gave
to man the same wisdom, the same intelligence,
the same resourcefulness, the same Life which the
Spirit of God Itself possessed. And the Spirit of
God gave of Itself to man without measure.
. •
11. And God said: “If I give to man my very
own Life without limit, man can then become as a
God. He can duplicate the things I have done.
He can know the joys and the glories which a
Life of creation such as mine enjoys. And I will
put man to work creating new worlds, and when
they are complete I will live together with man
wherever we choose, and all the glory I have
shall be man’s glory, too.”
12. And the Spirit of God said: “I will make
man of many colors. For the tropical climates
which I have created I will make a dark-skinned
man, and for the semi-tropical countries I will
make a semi-dark man. For the milder climes, I
will make a white man. And I will give to
these men wives, that they may be able to pro­
create their kind even as the animals reproduce
their kind. Male and female created I them, and
male and female will I create man.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 87
13. “And I will place man all over the earth.
He shall be endowed with My Life, and My
Spirit, and he shall have dominion over every­
thing I have created. He shall have My Powers
in him, and shall use them.”
14. So Almighty God began the creation of
man. He used the very same processes He had
used in the creation of the flowers, the mammals,
and the rest of the animals which were made by
the Spirit of God. It was the intention of Al­
mighty God that man should be thus created. For
the Spirit of God decided that the man he was
about to create should use the Life of God in him
to overcome every obstacle.
15. God said: “Man’s path shall not be an
easy one. He shall progress through the ages,
learning how to use the Spirit of Life in him to
overcome the obstacles which man will find. But
man will find, too, that the Spirit I have placed
in him will be more than sufficient to cause him
to be a conqueror. Then shall man know, as I
know, how to overcome things of the earth.”
16. And the Spirit of God said: “I will give
man speech. I will endow him with a large brain,
through which he can use the Life which is mine
in him. He shall have complete dominion over
the earth. He shall be like Me in creative abil­
ity.”
17. And the Spirit of God placed man upon
the earth. And it gave to him speech. And it
gave to him the ability to take care of himself.
And It gave to man what the animals had never
had, the ability to be conscious of the Spirit of
God in him. For man is the only creation of God
which is capable of speech, and which is capable
of knowing that the Spirit of God lives in him.
18. As in the case of the other creations, the
Spirit of God saw that evidence of man was left
where scientists and paleontologists might find
it. For the Spirit of God wanted man of today to
know the story of man of yesterday. And man
discovered that evidence. More than 500,000
years ago, in Java and Pekin in China, man was
living and raising children on the earth. He
lived in a cave. But man was on the earth, placed
here by the Spirit of God, more than half a mil­
lion years ago.
19. And the very same Life which the Spirit
of God placed in all Its other creations, was placed
in man, only in far greater measure. In fact, the
Spirit of God did not limit the Life he placed in
man. For, even in the dawn of the early creation
88 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 89
of man, the Spirit of God had ordained that man
should some day rule the earth, equally with God.
The Spirit of God ordained that man and God
should live together, united, throughout the
countless ages of eternity. For this reason the
Spirit of God created man, once more leaving
guide-posts to us who follow.
20. Following these signs, given to man by
the Spirit of God, we cannot go wrong. Follow­
ing “holy-men,” who stated that the earth was
created 6000 years ago, we shall wander for from
God. Man has wandered very far from God.
This prophet will show man the way back to God,
and man can then pick up the thread of his
journey to God, where he dropped it when le­
gends and myths about God were brought to
earth.
21. Evidence of the first man was discovered
by Dr. Chapman Andrews and a group of other
internationally known scientists, and the expedi­
tion to China where the skulls and bones of the
men were found, was financed by the Rocke­
feller Foundation. The signs which the Spirit
of God had left over half a million years ago were
found in 1927 A. D. by scientists.
22. About the time the first man was discov­
90 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
ered in Pekin, other and similar men were dis­
covered in Europe. Their bones are identical.
Now it came to pass that the man which the Spir­
it of God had placed upon the earth multiplied
rapidly as God intended he should. He became
a hunter. He lived through the glacial periods
of extreme cold, yet he survived, for the Life
of the Spirit of God which was in man could
not be extinguished by either heat nor cold. Noth­
ing can exterminate the Spirit of God.
23. In France and Germany evidences of the
first man were also found. This original man
probably lived out in the open much as the gyp­
sies do today. He fashioned spears and made bows
and arrows. He hunted game, and lived the only
life possible on the earth at that time. Had man
not been created by the Spirit of God, what we
know as civilization would not exist.
24. The earth then, without man, would be
teeming with all kinds of animal life, and it would
hardly be a fit place for the habitation of man.
As knowledge of the Life which is God in man
increased, so did man’s ability to expand and cre­
ate better things. This—as a result of the creative
Spirit of God in man.
25. Recent scientific discoveries prove that
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 91
about 200,000 years ago man lived both in Eng­
land and Germany. These men lived in caves.
The remains of whole families have been found,
together with the bones of the animals they killed
for food, and the fires on which they roasted the
food. The hand of God may be seen in all this.
For God wanted us to know just what the trail
which has been trodden by man over half a mil­
lion years was.
26. Had not the Spirit of God given us this
authentic information, the entire human race
might have believed some “holy-man” who, in
his religious zeal, might claim that God created
the universe in a short moment of time, probably
six days of twenty-four hours each, and man in an
instant of time, taking a rib from man to make a
woman.
27. But the evidence here discloses that the
Spirit of God created man, both male and female,
and sent him out on the face of the earth to make
his way as best he could. God did not put man
naked in a garden and expect him not to pay at­
tention to the naked woman God placed there
with him. That is not the way the Spirit of the
Creator has ever operated.
28. The creation of man probably took mil­
v
92 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
lions of years to complete. Every step in that cre­
ation was taken by the Power of the Spirit of God,
and this Spirit of God, even now, still lives in
man and gives him life, just as It did in the be­
ginning of man, at least half a million years ago.
29. Yet through all this time, the ever-pres­
ent Spirit of God in man, in all his different stages
of evolution, rose to the occasion and taught man
everything that it was necessary to know in or­
der that his life be amply provided for.
30. When man found that cave-bears already
lived in the caves man wanted to occupy, and
these bears ready to give fight, the Spirit of God
in man taught him how to make fire. This had
never been done on the face of the earth before.
Yet the Spirit of God in man rose to the occasion
and discovered the fact that fire could be made
by friction. This fire he used to keep the cave-
bears away from his habitation. He used fire to
cook his meals, although none had told man that
his meat should be cooked.
31. Having created man with the Life of God
in him, it did not take man long to discover that
an indwelling intelligence soon enabled him to
overcome all obstacles. Truly, he was master of
all he surveyed, even though his progress had not
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 93
been very far. Man, in his very earliest stage,
knew how to speak. He knew how to make fire.
He knew how to make spears and bows and ar­
rows, and he knew what sort of meat was good
for him to eat, and what was not.
32. The Spirit of God did not fail man, even
in his primary stages. Whenever the need for the
intelligence, which is God, manifested, there, too,
was the Spirit of God, ready and eager to show
man the way. Man, simple though he was, rough
though he was, was completely satisfied to allow
the Spirit of God in him to reveal whatever pow­
er and intelligence was necessary. Just as long as
man did that, the Spirit of God led him on up
through the ages. When man refused to do that
he began to fall and disaster overtook him.
33. This prehistoric man made traps. He built
huts. He fished. He hunted. He raised a family
and knew how to deliver the children when they
were born, although the science of medicine was
unknown in those crude days. But the Spirit of
God in man gave him all necessary information.
Great is the power of the Spirit of God. It is
well for all men to be humble before God, and
sing everlasting praises to the eternal goodness
of the Spirit of God.
94 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
34. The birds, the bees, the mammals, in fact
every phase of Life which the Spirit of God man­
ifested on the earth at the creation, was amply
cared for. There was enough of the Spirit of God
in each of these creations to abundantly care for
them. None starved to death. None went hun­
gry. The Spirit of God which created them took
care of them.
35. The Spirit of God would do that today
had not man interfered with the orderly creative
processes of the Spirit of God. We shall see later
how educated man attempted to tell God how
to run the universe, and met disaster face to face.
A disaster so great that had not this prophet been
raised up, man might annihilate himself com­
pletely from the face of the earth. Had man been
willing to allow the Spirit of God to finish Its
Great Creation without interference, there would
never have been one war on the earth.
36. Perhaps man will learn before the present
war is over. Perhaps he will not. If he does not,
doom faces the entire human race. For the Spirit
of God knows how to help. It does not need man
to tell It what It should do to help. If man wants
that help man will take the Power of God in the
only manner in which man can get the help of the
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 95
Spirit of God, and that is direct from God. Not
through any man or any organization, or system
of religion. God does not need man-made theol­
ogy to tell Him how to take care of man. If man
refuses to use the Spirit of God, man will pay for
his foolishness.
37. The invisible Spirit of God, so great in
Power that It could create by Its own Life, the
universe, the celestial sphere, the material and
physical creation, may be safely trusted with the
destiny of man. Only when man attempted to
take his destiny out of the hands of God and put
it into the hands of another did man lose his
high estate. He will never regain that estate un­
til he puts his destiny back where it belongs.
38. Man will have to go back quite a ways.
He will have to undo the mistakes of the past.
If he is not willing to do that he will go deeper
and deeper into the mire. And man cannot save
himself. He must get back to God, the Great
Spirit which created him. He will have to dis­
card much of what was taught him about God. He
will have to do what man has always had to do,
down through the ages—he will have to allow
God to run his life.
39. Man will have to allow God to shape his
96 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
destiny like primitive, prehistoric man did. He
will have to completely discard recently achieved
legends and myths concerning God. He will have
to allow God to continue to manifest whatever
Power is necessary to bring him to his final state
of perfection. Man will have to go back along the
trail where he lost the guidance of God. There he
will find it again, but man himself must make the
trek back.
40. God will not change Its method of crea­
tion and guidance for anything man can produce.
For the Spirit of God needs not the help of man,
no matter how good or enlightened that man may
presume himself to be. The Spirit of God alone
can bring order out of chaos. The Spirit of God
alone can prevent world-marauders from mani­
festing. The Spirit of God alone is all man needs.
Not churches or priests or other types of “holy-
men.” The Spirit of God is the only Guide. De­
struction lies in any other path. Man is discover­
ing that fact now.
41. Not one form of creation was imperfect
from the original humble amoeba to the highest
form of man. When they came from the hand of
God they were as perfect as God could make
them. Every creation of God with the exception
of man has remained perfect according to the
manner in which the Almighty created them.
42. Man, and man alone, attempted to inter­
fere with the normal process of God’s creation.
Man alone attempted to teach the truths of God
to other men. Systems of religion which orig­
inated with man, based on unsound theologies,
separated man from God. That was a mistake.
God was creating man and leading man in the
way which best suited the Spirit of God. Now
man must discover his mistake. He must ex­
change man-made theologies for the Spirit of
God. He must let God take up the operations of
making man perfect at the very place where he
lost them.
43. The Spirit of God is more to be trusted
than are man-made systems of religion, no mat­
ter how honest they may be.
44. There are those who would have us be­
lieve that man “fell” from God somewhere in
the skies, even before man was manifested as a
physical being. This is not true. It is on this
earth where man was estranged from God, and
this estrangement is comparatively recent. It
was brought about by religious organizations
whose ideas about God’s plan of creation and
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 97
98 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
growth were different from those being pursued
by Almighty God.
45. These well-meaning folk, pretending to
be teaching the truths of God, are the very ones
who lead the human race away from God. Man
will not findGod until he discards human philoso­
phies about God, and agrees to allow the Spirit
of God to finish the work it began, ages before
systems of religion were ever heard of.
CHAPTER TWO
1. Now IT CAME TO PASS THAT AS THE SCIEN-
tists and geologists explored in different parts of
the world, the story of the creation of man and
his differing stages of growth and advancement
was clearly revealed as the Spirit of God intended
it should be.
2. Sufficient of the bones of early man were
found to enable these good men to reconstruct
with a remarkable degree of accuracy the first
species of the human race. The fact that these
bones and skulls were discovered all over the
world proves that man had been fruitful and mul­
tiplied, as the Creator intended he should.
3. All over the world man had gone. In al­
most every country there have been found the
remains of man, and other information showing
to what degree of intelligence man has progressed.
4. Now the Spirit of God had so ordained
that man should not become completely perfect
during so short a space of time as 500,000 years.
The creation of the universe and the animals had
1 0 0 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
taken billions of years. But man was placed on
the earth only about half a million years ago.
5. But because the Spirit of God was placed
in man to a far greater degree than in the ani­
mals, man’s progress was very much faster. The
Spirit of God ordained it so.
6. The Neanderthal Man, probably the old­
est of all men, has been reconstructed and may
be seen by whoever cares to see him. There was
another species of man known as the Piltdown
Man. The names given to these different species
of men usually came from the locality where the
skeletons had been found. But the Spirit of God
had done Its work well. We have these records
to guide us.
7. Soon skeletons were discovered which were
surrounded with flint instruments, shells, and the
bones of reindeer, buffalo, horses, foxes and dif­
ferent kinds of birds. So the Spirit of God dis­
closes to us that man, two or three hundred thou­
sand years ago, had progressed to the stage where
he was capable of hunting, fishing, shooting, and
enjoying the Life which the Spirit of God had
placed in him, in many different ways.
8. Let it be remembered that the Spirit of
God made man of different colored skins, each
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 101
suited to the localities where man lived. Great
was the wisdom of God. But although the colors
of their skins was different, their bodily functions
were the same.
9. They all were made in the image of God.
They could all think. They could all rapidly ad­
vance in knowledge. They were all capable of
recognizing the fact that a Power, much greater
than they were, gave them life in the beginning,
place that beginning where one may.
10. And man was happy. Although not de­
veloped to the state of consciousness present-day
man is developed to in this stage of evolution,
man was supremely happy. Ghastly wars such
as are being waged today were impossible with
primitive man.
11. Had God been allowed to finish Its great
creation of man without interference, man would
not be waging wars today. Perhaps it had been
better had we not what we call “civilization” to­
day. But the work of the Spirit of God must be
completed. The present dark days are only tem­
porary. When man sees the mistake he made in
following those who foolishly thought they could
help God with Its creation, and decides to allow
the Spirit of God to complete the work It started,
S P E A K S
102 A P R O P H E T
man will once more live ift peace and be happy
again.
12. One thing very evident to scientists who
investigate the origin of man is the fact that his
cultural development and his general progress
was very slow. Truly the hand of God moves
very slowly but very surely.
13. Now it came to pass that a bit later in the
evolution of man there appeared witch doctors,
medicine men, and “holy-men.” Superstition was
still in the mind of the man God was creating,
and this superstition was very fertile ground for
these witch-doctors, medicine men, and “holy-
men »
14. They saw an opportunity to amass great
possessions by claiming to have superior knowl­
edge about God, their Creator. Not content to
allow the Spirit of God to finish the work It had
begun, these “holy-men” sowed the first seeds
of distrust of God, in men.
15. So to further their own interests they
sowed among man the seeds of distrust in his Cre­
ator. The holy-men went among men, claiming
to be men of God. They told man that he was a
very bad man. A sinner. Why man should be a
sinner when the hand of God created him they
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 103
did not explain. They did, however, tell man
that God was very angry with man because he
was not following these holy-men. They pointed
to the lightning, the storm, and man, believing
that God was angry with him, ran for protection
into the caves in which he lived.
16. These witch-doctors and holy-men predict­
ed all sorts of dire things would happen to man
if he did not follow them. So rapidly did these
superstitions grow that there appeared on the
earth, in all parts, different types of holy men.
When man learned to write, these holy-men pro­
duced parchments, all of their own making, and
told man that God had written on the parch­
ments and slabs.
17. And man, not being fully developed, be­
lieved them.
18. It is at this point that primitive man sowed
the seeds of all the misery, suffering,wars, plagues
and pestilences which began to follow in the wake
of man, and which we are witnessing today as
never before.
19. Had man been able to think a bit more
clearly he would have seen that a God great
enough to create the universe and man was cer­
tainly great enough to finish Its creation.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
104
20. But the element of fear and superstition
was still great in the minds of primitive man, so
these holy-men found the going good. They
spread all over the world, leaving different teach­
ings, now known as systems of religion, behind
them.
21. The stories they told, and which man be­
lieved, were fantastic in the extreme. The basis
of them all was that man was a sinner. He had
fallen away from God, and unless he returned
to God via the way each holy-man prescribed,
man should never come to know God.
22. To the contrary, God Almighty had pre­
pared a place where all bad men and sinners, like
primitive man, were to go. Various devices of
torture were threatened if man did not believe
what the holy-men told them.
23. One favorite lie of the holy-men was that
God has created a place burning with fire and
brimstone. Into that, to burn and scream and be
tortured forever, would go every man, woman
and child who did not believe what these holy-
men told them to believe.
24. Many and varied were the stories told of
how men fell, and how God came to be angry
with man. There was a different story for every
holy-man and the system of religion he created.
25. If the sins man was committing were not
too bad, he might curry favor with God by build­
ing an altar of rocks and burning some sacrifice
which usually consisted of an animal. Then God,
smelling the smoke and the smell of burning
flesh, would be pleased, and he would hold off
His great punishments for the time being.
26. After a while, however, the man God had
created began to be a bit skeptical of these burnt
offerings. So the holy men, to satisfy a growing
distrust of the holy men and their stories, invented
a far greater sacrifice. They dragged Almighty
God off His Throne, and sacrificed Him for the
sins of the world.
27. Man had not developed yet to the state
where he could believe in his Creator without
visible evidence. He had not developed to the
place where he could conceive of the Creator
being invisible Spirit.
28. The holy-men, knowing this, introduced
the sacrifice of gods, telling their followers that
only through the sacrifice of a god, usually on a
cross, could man be saved from his sinful self.
And primitive man believed these holy-men.
29. We have much evidence of the remnants
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 105
106 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
of this type of religious superstition on the earth
today. Latest statistics show that out of a popula­
tion of about 130,000,000 people in the United
States there still are about 15,000,000 who still
attend the churches which olden times holy-men
laid the foundation for 50,000 years ago.
30. This type of superstition is rapidly dying
out, as well it might. For it is the cause of the
separation of God and man. Of course, man and
God never have really been separated. But man
has been willing to believe what the holy-men
teach. When man decides that what these holy-
men teach is not true, and when he returns to
the place where he is willing to allow the Spirit
of God to lead him, as God has from His creation
until the appearance of the holy-men, then will
man once more take up his march forward to ul­
timate joy and happiness, with the Spirit of God
leading the way.
31. It is very evident to those who have given
the time to investigate fully that the means used
to discredit God’s ability to deal with man as It
sees fit, were very fraudulent. Those who advo­
cated these man-made beliefs knew they were
fraudulent.
32. Had primitive man only had the sense to
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 107
ask the holy-men for proof of their doctrines they
would not have believed the foolish theories these
holy-men advocated.
33. Every type of fraud and forgery was prac­
ticed by the holy-men and is still practiced today
in ever greater measure than it was in olden times.
Fortunately for man, he has arrived at the plane
of intelligence where the preachments of theholy-
men have no longer any effect on man. He re­
fuses to believe them.
34. So the systems of religion which these holy-
men have built are empty places. Man is at the
halting place. He will not accept the preach­
ments of modern holy-men. This is a good sign.
35. One look at humanity today, with all the
gruesome horrors, sufferings, and misery, speaks
plainly the terrible effects of primitive man as a
result of his listening to these holy men or, as
they called themselves, “men of God.”
36. Our high school boys are being murdered
on foreign battle fields by the thousands, and the
whole earth is soaked in human blood, and this is
all because holy men attempted to convince man
that the Spirit of God was not capable of con­
tinuing the creation of man, bringing man to his
108 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
logical end, which must be complete union with
God.
37. Had primitive man chosen to eject every
holy man and every holy book produced by these
holy men, war would be completely unknown on
the earth today.
38. The Spirit of God had done marvelous
things in bringing the whole celestial sphere and
all created things on the earth into existence.
That Spirit is abundantly able to bring man to
God. But the holy men, preying upon the super­
stitions and fears of primitive man, planted seeds
of distrust of God which will take many years to
eradicate.
39. Those who sought to interfere with the
methods God used and is still using to bring man
to God, are the very ones who are directly re­
sponsible for the sins and the crimes of the world
today.
40. The Spirit of God had an idea when It
created man. It knew what It was doing. Left
alone, man would probably know the beauties of
the glorious fullness of the knowledge of God
today. Instead, man is farther away from God
than even in his incomplete history, and it is
holy-men who have brought this estrangement
about.
41. The answer, then, is clear—pay no atten­
tion to holy-men. Believe in the ability of the
Spirit of God to complete the works that Spirit
so wonderfully accomplished, until the appear­
ance of the holy-men, preying upon the super­
stitions and fears of primitive man.
42. So it came to pass that as man grew and
multiplied and covered the earth, systems of re­
ligion, originated by these holy-men grew apace.
Not all men and women believed the holy-men.
Very few indeed. But their followers grew apace
with the population. At the present writing there
are eleven major systems of religion on the earth,
and each one dates back to holy-men who lived
on the earth thousands of years ago, and went
about inculcating their damnable doctrines in the
minds of the human race God had so wonderfully
created.
43. Every conceivable form of fraud and
treachery was practiced by these holy-men, and
is still practiced today by the organizations they
left behind them. The farther back the investi­
gator goes the greater do the frauds become.
44. Yet in substance they remain, and the
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S J09
110 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
world suffers the absence of the consciousness of
God because of these pious frauds which, instead
of revealing the Power of the Spirit of God to
men, effectively hide those truths. Man, not
knowing any better, has considered the only way
to God lies through these holy-men.
45. The vast majority bf human beings on
the earth today refuse to have anything to do
with any type of holy-man, but not knowing
where God is to be found, they have lost all in­
terest in God.
46. It is the duty of this prophet of God to
bring man back to the path he left when the holy
men took charge of man’s spiritual affairs. Their
frauds must be exposed. They must be shown up
for what they are. Then, and only then, can
civilization get back on the pathway where the
Spirit of God had it before the time of the holy
men.
47. In the year 1943, with the whole world
at war, we have a striking example of how holy
men work. The United States and Great Britain
together with China and Russia are fighting for
four freedoms. No man in his right mind dis­
agrees with those four freedoms.
48. The earth and humanity are being raped
and murdered by three, nations who believe they
can subdue the earth by brute force. These three
nations are Germany, Japan and Italy. The world
well knows their philosophies and their religion.
They are bathing the earth with human blood.
Had holy men not entered into the picture, and
had God been allowed to finish His creation as
He planned it, this could not have happened.
49. But it has happened. Not very long ago
Italy made a nefarious attempt to stab her friend­
ly neighbor, France, in the back. This at the so­
licitation of Germany. On the eve of this brutal
back-stabbing the holy-men of the Italian sys­
tem of religion, known as the Roman Catholic
church, with headquarters in Rome, Italy, went
among the Italian soldiers practicing their sorcery
among them.
50. They “blessed” these Italian murderers,
and, to quote, “prayer for the success of the Ital­
ian soldiers so that the flag of the House of Savoy
(Italy) may wave forever over the holy sepulchre
in Rome.”
51. These are the holy men who attempted to
interfere with God’s orderly plan of creation by
telling primitive man that God had given to the
head of this Italian holy order the keys to the
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S m
112 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
kingdom of heaven. They still tell men and
women, and many are foolish enough to believe
them, that unless one is a member of that church
he or she will lose his or her soul.
52. This shows up the Italian holy-men for
what they are. The four freedoms they are not
interested in. The United States is at war with
Italy. Yet, to further their pagan teachings, they
are in sympathy with the brutal murdering Ital­
ians who stabbed France in the back.
53. This is true “holy” religion in its highest
form. This is the type of religion holy-men prac­
tice all over the world. This it is which has come
between God and man. Until it is removed man
will not, cannot, know God.
54. In order to propagate this type of sorcery
these holy-men descend to every type of fraud,
deceit, and treachery. The human race has been
retarded several thousands of years through these
holy-men. But a thousand years are but as a day
in the sight of the Spirit of God, and these human
parasites, which call themselves holy-men, will
pass away, and, in spite of them, man will soon
return to the path from which holy-men caused
him to stray.
55. There is unmistakable evidence of this to­
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 113
day. For man is thinking. As he thinks he sees
the fallacy of the sorcery of religion. His mind
automatically begins to cast around for the way
back to God.
56. For mankind today knows there is a living
Creator. He knows this because the Spirit of God
is in man, and that Great Spirit is revealing Itself
to man. As the Spirit of God points the way back
to God, man will take that way.
57. For man is using his brain as never before.
When man uses his brain, the Spirit of God speaks
through that brain. When the Spirit of God
speaks, the sorcery of holy men is shown for what
it really is. Truly the holy sorcerers of primitive
man have a lot to answer for.
58. This prophet of God realizes his wonder­
ful task to the full. He is happy that the Spirit
of God has laid it upon his heart to lead man
back to God. This is the greatest religious work
of all time. Exposing the holy-men and bringing
man back to the pathway upon which the Spirit
of God started him, and will finish when the holy
men are all gone.
59. False prophecies and miracles and fraudu­
lent relics were the chief reliance among the
holy men in their attempt to take the spiritual
114 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
leadership out of the hands of God and put it into
their own hands.
60. Man, in his incomplete state, fell an easy
prey to the superstitions of the holy-men. They,
in turn, knowing the superstition and fear of in­
complete man, took full advantage, and various
means were used by the holy men to stimulate the
credulity of the ignorant and superstitious masses
of an earlier age. The going is much more dif­
ficult today.
61. These holy-men made “gods” which, they
told man, were endowed with supernatural power.
They did not tell the people that the only One
endowed with power above man is the Spirit of
God. That would have made the existence of
these holy-men unnecessary.
62. So it came to pass that the holy-men made
graven images of these “gods,” and, by trickery
and buffoonery, caused many to believe in them.
Some of these idols had wounds in them which
would bleed. In others, the eyes would wink,
while the heads of some of the other idols would
nod.
63. One idol these holy-men made would wink
its eyes, nod its head, and raise its limbs. This
was a very authentic idol, for it was taken from
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 115
Boxley, in Kent, England, to London, where it
was publicly broken up, and the springs which
made this “god” operate were exposed.
64. So, by trick and device, the holy men who
took man’s eyes off God and put them on their
own organization, slowed up God’s clock of time,
and brought to the human race untold misery.
They are still doing this.
65. But man is beginning to think. He knows
by this time that one cannot get back to God by
witchery, sorcery, and fraud practiced by holy
men who, in reality, are the greatest stumbling
block which stands in the pathway to God.
66. One of the greatest frauds perpetrated by
these holy-men, in our own times, was an idol
called Memnon. This statue would talk, sing,
and perform many other marvelous things. But
the secret was discovered by a Mr. Wilkinson one
day. He discovered a cavity in which a priest or a
holy-man was concealed. There was the answer
to the talking and the singing and the ringing of
the bells.
67. There was another very famous statue
which, according to the holy men, was thrown
down from heaven by a god by the name of Zeus.
It landed in the City of Troy which city was sup­
116 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
posed to be impregnable as long as the statue was
in the city.
68. Every once in a while these holy-men
would bring down a “god” in person, and a time
of great drinking and rejoicing would be had
by all.
69. With these holy-men originated the theo­
ries of heaven and hell. All who joined the or­
ganization would, after death, and after going
through purgatory, live forever in a place above
the sky called “heaven.” All others would be cast
into a place called hell where they would roast
and frizzle and fry through all eternity.
70. How very far removed all this is from the
slow, orderly manner in which the Spirit of God
created the universe. How utterly opposed to the
methods by which the Spirit of God had brought
the universe into being.
71. Only when man leaves behind the holy
men and their theories of God, together with their
sorceries and witchcrafts, only then can man come
back to the Spirit of God and allow that Great
Spirit to finish Its creation.
CHAPTER THREE
1. Now IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE HUMAN
race which the Spirit of God had created had pop­
ulated the earth. Each type of human being had
migrated to the land best suited for him. Those
of dark skins settled in the tropical lands while
those of lighter skins chose the more moderate
climes. As they scattered they found the holy-
men following them.
2. These holy-men at once continued to ply
their nefarious trade, and huge systems of religion
came into existence. Man temporarily forgot that
when the Spirit of God created him that Great
Spirit placed Its own Life in him, exactly as It
had done in all other forms of created Life.
3. But the human mind was not as yet fully
illumined, and the holy-men were able to cause
vast systems of religion to appear. These came to
be known as the representatives of God. They
claimed that.
4. Adorning themselves in black robes and
hoods they paraded through the streets looking
more like ghosts, or hobgoblins, than like agents
118 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
of God. And man, not knowing of the presence
of the Spirit of God in him, followed them
blindly.
5. These religious organizations became im­
mensely rich. They builded great temples in
which they performed their rites and rituals.
They burned their incense. They made confes­
sion boxes where their poor, deluded followers
went, with a priest, to “confess their sins.” There
was always a charge connected with this sin-for­
giving business, so both holy-man and church
rolled in wealth, while man was retrograding
mentally.
6. The idol idea seemed to be the most effec­
tive of all, for idols of their “gods” were made in
great profusion and sold to whoever would buy
them.
7. And so it came to pass that every large sys­
tem of religion founded by these holy-men had a
different “god.” Each copied from the other,
though, and here again we see the wisdom of the
Spirit of God. For the Creator here again caused
records of the holy-men to be made so that we,
coming later, might read the records and know
for a fact what these systems of religion and their
holy-men really are.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 119
8. Man can go back as far as 100,000 years
and obtain evidence of the workings of the witch
doctors, the medicine men and the holy-men.
Usually these holy-men absorbed the witch doc­
tors and the sorcerers, and became all three.
9. It is interesting to note that the same funda­
mental superstitions ran through all of these sys­
tems of religion. The stories of their “gods” are
alike.
10. The favorite superstition was that Al­
mighty God, seeing the very sinful condition of
the man the Spirit of God had created, caused a
great flood to come upon the earth and drown, like
rats in a trap, God’s whole human creation. We
know that God does not employ such methods as
that.
11. The holy-men, however, used this super­
stition with telling effect to bolster their own in­
secure position.
12. Now it came to pass at this point that
the fabrication of Satan or the Devil came into
vogue. This is the first time that any of the crea­
tions of the Spirit of God had originated a mythi­
cal power which was supposed to have been so
powerful that it could enter the home in heaven,
120 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
in which God lived, and dispute with God for the
mastery of the earth.
13. This myth is purely a fabrication of holy
men and the systems of religion they originated.
But they played this myth for all it was worth.
It finally became the basis of over three-score sys­
tems of religion, as these holy-men called their
organizations.
14. They may have been systems of religion,
but they were, and still are, the very antithesis of
God. The Spirit of God is not in them. There
never was a Satan or a Devil, but had there been,
that is where these holy-men and their systems of
religion originated. Most certainly not in God.
15. The argument was used that unless the
human race joined hands with these systems of
religion, every last man and woman and child
would lose its immortal soul and land up in hell
with the Devil and his angels. This idolatry is
very far removed from the truths of God, as we
have seen those truths manifesting in God’s crea­
tion over a few billions of years.
16. Now it must be noticed that these holy
men fallacies constitute the basis of every system
of religion in the United States today. They are
all the results of these primitive holy-men and
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 121
their fabrications. They are, therefore, the very
agencies which are keeping man from the path­
way to God, not showing the way. Every one
of them, based on the fabrications, lies, and de­
ception and fraud of priests, is leading its fol­
lowers not back to God, but farther away from
God.
17. However, not having the Spirit of God
in them, these systems of religion not only can­
not teach the truths of God, they cannot even get
a fair sized audience. The American people flock
by the hundreds of thousands to a Sunday base­
ball game or a football game, while the churches,
which these holy-men have built, contain but a
scattered handful of “the faithful.” If “the faith­
ful” knew what they were being faithful to there
would be no congregation at all. For the truths
of God cannot be taught by any organization
which has its origin in the teachings of primitive
holy-men and their sorcery and fabrication. For
this reason they fail.
18. Had these organizations the truths of God
in them they would be able to use the Power of
the Spirit of God to manifest the truth of God
on the earth. This they cannot do. They are,
then, pagan organizations following pagan myths
122 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
and superstitions originated by the witch doctors,
medicine men, and holy men of past unenlight­
ened ages. Their doom is sure.
19. In this day, when all humanity is stagger­
ing under a terrible load of human slaughter and
misery, and is crying out for some knowledge of
God, these pagan-originated churches have noth­
ing to offer better than a superstition about God,
taught to them by holy-men of a dark and pagan
past. This fact alone disproves any claim they
may make that there is any of God in them.
20. If we go to these organizations for knowl­
edge of God, we are at once led back to an im­
possible story that Almighty God came to the
earth 2000 years ago and was murdered by a
handful of Roman soldiers on a cross that you and
I might have a home in heaven at some future
time.
21. No less than thirty-five different “gods”
have been so slaughtered to bring salvation to the
world, according to thirty-five different systems
of religion which have sprung into existence as a
result of the holy-men of by-gone ages. Their
stigma still remains. Man is still farther from
God than he ever was. There could be no other
result.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 123
22. The same sorcery, witchcraft and. priest­
craft, which took the eyes of man from God,
operates in the same manner today. Priests burn
incense and candles, and chant jargon in Latin.
They still forgive sins, dress in elaborate robes.
All of which is so very foreign to the way the
Spirit of God operates. When religion, as brought
to the earth by holy-men goes out, man will be
able to return to God.
23. All the crime, all the suffering, all the
dying groans of our young boys on the bloody bat­
tle fields of Guadalcanal and Bataan—all these
and the war which accompanies them, are the
direct result of holy-men who, not satisfied with
the manner in which the Spirit of God was run­
ning the universe, and for priestly gain, attempted
to take over God’s part in the creation of a perfect
man. As a result they threw the human race back
thousands of years.
24. They substituted idolatry for God. Their
end will be sad, indeed, and that end is in sight.
25. In order to give a semblance of the mirac­
ulous to their “gods” these holy men credited
them with being bom in the womb of a virgin.
That is not the method employed by the Spirit of
124 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
God. It is a fabrication of the holy-men of primi­
tive man.
26. If, they figured, they could claim virgin-
birth for their idol “god,” and then present this
“god” in image form, they could sell these images
and the exchequer would then be bolstered. To­
day they go so far as to “worship” the “sacred
heart” of their idolatrous “god.” Every conceiv­
able sort of sorcery of the soul is resorted to by
these holy-men. As a result, those who follow
after them go deeper and deeper into the mire,
and farther and farther away from God they get.
27. In India, where millions of men went to
in ages past, they have three systems of religion,
and there is a virgin-born crucified god at the
head of them all. It was from one of these sys­
tems that our present religion, which operates
here in America, was copied. Every fundamental
of the religion which came to America was known
to millions thousands of years before the birth of
Christianity. Millions of Egyptians and Hindoos
knew the story. They themselves had it 1500
years before the holy-men of Christianity had it.
It was stolen from them by the holy-men who
gave birth to the latest of all systems of religion
but one.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 125
28. The crime lies in the fact that so many
human beings who have not taken the time to find
out what this thing called religion really is, ac­
tually believe in what it teaches as the truths of
the Spirit of God. For religion is passed down
from father to son. What the father is, the chil­
dren will be.
29. It will take time to eradicate it and return
the human race to God. When this is done, man
will discover that he does not have to depend upon
any holy-men for knowledge of God. The human
race has progressed far enough that the plain sim­
ple truths of God can be readily seen, and quickly
grasped when the sorcery of the holy-men is out
of the way.
30. No matter what the cost may be, man will
have to pay that price for his wanderings from
the Realm where the Spirit of God has complete
control over man and his destinies.
31. We are witnessing today a brilliant ex­
ample of what man can do to civilization and the
earth, when away from God. And man was never
farther away from God than he is now. The
Great Spirit of God is continuing Its work of per­
fecting man, but so very few know this. Those
who do not follow after the holy-men have for­
126 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
gotten God. This ghastly war, with all its hor­
rors and sufferings, may cause men to think. It
may bring man back to God. If it does not, the
human race will finally work out its own destruc­
tion.
32. So it has come to pass that the Spirit of
God has raised up this prophet who, in himself,
has little to merit his being made a true prophet
of God. But strange are the ways of the Creator.
Strange, indeed.
33. Not until every vestige of theories ad­
vanced ages ago by holy-men has been done away
with can man return to God, for Him to finish
the work He began when he first created man.
34. Theories of virgin-born gods, resurrected
after having been slain on a cross for the sins of
the world, are not of God. They must go. If re­
ligion does not voluntarily throw such foolish
hangovers of the holy-men to one side and find the
existing truths of God, man’s future is darker than
the present.
35. For the Spirit of God is willing that man
should throw away these pagan idols and return.
When man does, the Spirit of God can then com­
plete Its picture. It will be a beautiful picture.
But with man deliberately running after strange
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 1 2 7
gods, originated by holy-men with their holy
books, man is beyond the pale of the Almighty.
There is nothing God can do for him so long as
man stays away from the Spirit of God.
36. Now the Spirit of God knows this. It
watches the present mad struggle of the nations
for supremacy. And the Spirit of God knows
that no matter which nation wins, if either, man
will still be just as far away from God as he was
when he followed the holy-men.
37. But the creative operations of the Spirit of
God continue, in spite of the fact that man follows
after strange gods. The whole scheme of creation
cannot be halted just because man goes away from
God. Nor does it make any difference to the
Spirit of God how far man goes away from God.
That is man’s business. If he continues to stay
away from God—if he continues to follow holy
men, he will go to his doom. All his church theol­
ogies, all his holy-men, won’t be able to save him
from complete destruction. For, while earnestly
believing their preachments are of God, they re­
fuse to see the signs of the times.
38. The sky is red. But the holy-men refuse to
give up their holy idols. Humanity is crucifying
itself on the battlefields of the world. But the
1 2 8 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
holy-men and their followers are not concerned.
They think more of their idols than they do of the
Spirit of God.
39. For they know that the Spirit of God in
men’s lives could never lead men into such brutal
wholesale murder. But they like their idols. They
like their holy-men. Then let them have them.
Let others who do not follow holy-men lead the
way back to God. They can. They are the only
ones who can. For they have not allowed the holy-
men and holy books to blind their eyes to the pres­
ent existence of the Creator, the Spirit of God in
every human life.
40. There is but one path lying ahead of hu­
manity today. Men may plan. Men may scheme.
They may map out a future of international peace
and justice. But these plans, even if feasible,
would lead them farther than ever astray. If the
holy-men and the holy books are allowed to lead
men and women away from God, then all the
plans and schemes of men will go awry.
41. There must be, and there will be, a whole­
sale return to the Spirit of God if humanity is to
permanently recover from the abyss the holy-men
have led it into. No plans for the future will
amount to a thing if those plans are not predicated
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 129
and based upon the existenc of the Spirit of God
in human lives. If holy-men and holy orders are
allowed to wield political influence, the future is
dark. It will be dark until mankind discovers
that God cannot be found through the dark-age
theories and pagan rites of holy-men.
42. The Almighty did a perfect job of creat­
ing over billions of ages. It did a marvelous job in
the creation of man. Just as long as man is willing
to allow the Almighty to continue Its plan, man
and God will find each other. Man can, and will,
find and recognize the staggering import of the
Life of the Spirit of God in him.
43. But until man returns to the protection and
care of the Spirit of God, without holy-men and
their idol gods, man cannot ever find God. The
Spirit of God, as Life, is in every created human
being. That Spirit, recognized and allowed to
take complete charge of the life, can liberate man
instantly.
44. This is the only God necessary. But let
man clutter up his life with gods who were born
a few thousand years ago, and then killed on a
cross, and man will continue to wander into the
black night of pagan myth and superstition.
130 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
Eventually he will get so far away from God that
his return will be almost an impossibility.
45. The return of man to God must be volun­
tary. God will not break one single Law of God
to bring about the return of man to the path God
placed his feet on. He will not send a son to be
killed. He will not go out looking for man like a
shepherd looking for a lost sheep. God exists. The
Spirit of God exists in every Life. It is the origin
of that Life. When man looks where God is, man
will find God. Not until.
CHAPTER FOUR
1. NOW THIS REVELATION WILL SHOCK MANY
good church members. Religion is due for a
shock. Those who have followed holy men and
their holy books are due for a shock which the
author hopes will jar them out of their compla­
cency and away from their idolatrous teachings
about Almighty God. Nothing less than a shock
can do that.
2. Unless someone shocks the churches into
the truth they will die as humanity will die, if it
continues to wander away from its Creator—the
Spirit of God.
3. Now it happens that all religions seek to
promulgate their own doctrines, creeds, rites, and
rituals. To tell religion that its premises and dog­
mas are untrue takes a true prophet of God. None
other may successfully attempt to do this. If
they do, disaster will follow them.
4. The true prophet of God has been with
God. He knows God. He has penetrated the veil
of mystery which has been placed about God by
132 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
holy men. He knows whereof he speaks, and the
world usually listens when a true prophet speaks.
5. Now a true prophet of God, speaking in
this present age, must say things which holy men
and holy orders do not like. But these holy men
and holy orders have not been able to reveal the
Power of the Spirit of God to the human race.
Nor have they been able to tell the human race
where or how it can discover the Spirit of God.
6. Each claims to have the truths of God,
but while they are claiming this, the whole
world runs riot. Humanity is spilling its own
blood at a fearful rate. Yet no holy man alive,
or no holy organization alive can do one thing to
stop this brutal slaughter but the Power of the
Spirit of God. This brands their theology false.
7. This is but proof of the statement of this
prophet that God is not in their stories. Nor can
God be in their lives, consciously. Every created
human man and woman has in him and in her
the Life of God which is the Spirit of God.
8. But holy men have taught that their god
is in heaven, sitting at the right hand of another
god, who, some day, so they tell us, will descend
from the heavens with a shout and the voice of an
angel. Then this god will smash all his enemies,
saving all told about 144,000 people.
9. Now the reasoning mind of man today
knows this is not true. If he thinks he will know
that God is not to be found in such a story as that.
For these are the type of concepts of God which
were brought to humanity by the witch doctors,
medicine men and holy-men of ages long since
past. Yet our churches have nothing better than
those old untrue myths to offer the twentieth cen­
tury.
10. They do not satisfy. They cannot satisfy.
They cannot bring God to this dying world. The
only ones they can hold are they who have been
raised in that type of tradition. They cannot, do
not, add materially to their numbers. Certainly
they will never win the world to their concepts
of Almighty God. They still are agents of dark­
ness—not agents of Light.
11. So, then, the human race, with its scores
of systems of religions and crucified gods, are both
in danger of annihilation because of lack of au­
thentic information about God. The myths of
the dark ages are proving themselves to be just
that, in the present emergency, when civilization
trembles in the balance.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 133
134 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
12. No power is known by any system of re­
ligion or its god, or its hundreds of thousands of
churches which can have one iota of weight
against the Axis powers. Therefore, they have
not the true God.
13. It all goes back to thousands of years ago
when holy-men (? ) seeing an opportunity to cap­
italize upon the credulity of a man which the
Creator had not completed, trumped up a series
of “gods” which these holy-men sold to whoever
would buy them.
14. Millions of good, honest men and women
of all religions today are mystified. They are los­
ing faith in their “gods.” They might well lose
faith in them. It is a pity they ever had faith in
them. For with this world slaughtering itself as
never before in history, none of these “gods,” nor
all of them put together, can make the slightest
impression on a humanity which, for lack of au­
thentic knowledge of God, is going mad.
15. Now that the Spirit of God has sent a true
prophet to bring them back to God will they lis­
ten? They will. Not a first. But, because this
prophet speaks truly, someone will listen. As the
logic of the Spirit of God appeals to the Spirit of
Life, or God, in man, there will slowly be started
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 135
a return to God. Not a return to religion because
there never has been much back-sliding from re­
ligion. But a return to God.
16. More correctly stated, a discovery of the
Power of the Spirit of God. When man makes
that discovery as the author has made it, little
time will be lost fooling round with any so-
called “god” who was so impotent that he had to
take human form, only to be killed on a cross.
17. Without the “sin” and “lost-soul” theory,
both of which are false, the holy-men would have
no selling argument at all. Just as soon as think­
ing man discards these false theories, and looks
within to the Spirit of God right where the Al­
mighty placed that Spirit, man will be on the
right track at long last.
18. For when the Creator placed Its own Life
in man, It placed there all the Powers of the
Realm of the Spirit of God. Those Powers are
quite able to reveal themselves to man. When the
stories of the scores of cricified “gods,” advocat­
ed by the “holy-men” are out of the way, the
Spirit of God can speak. Not w ill speak, but can
speak. The Creator cannot speak now. The hu­
man heart is filled with idolatrous conceptions of
God.
136 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
19. To have the Power of the Spirit of God
actually living in the human body, is, if one is
looking for miracles, a miracle of all miracles. It
is the supreme miracle of all. It is the mystery of
the ages. Why God did this is known but to God
alone. But there it is. The very Life of God in us.
That means that all the Powers the Spirit of God
has is available to us, any time we clear away the
tapestries of pagan ideas of God and let the Light
shine in.
20. God wants that to happen. That is the
only reason God put His own life in man. The
Spirit of God wants to show man how great and
glorious man can be, if the Spirit of God is al­
lowed to finish Its amazing work.
21. But if any sign of failure, of weakness,
enters in, the Spirit of God is blocked. It cannot
proceed because man will not allow the Spirit of
God to manifest Itself. Man’s mind is full of
other, and false, ideas of God. As long as they
are there, how can the Spirit of God reveal Itself
to man?
22. To realize that the Life of God is in every
man is to realize that all the Power God has is in
every man. You may see now how very different
the actual truths of God are from the falsehoods
of holy-men.
23. To know fully, to know consciously, to
know mentally, that the Spirit of God actually
abides in you is to come into possession of a Power
so vital, so absolute, that your whole life can be
changed by It. It means that with God in you
you have, whether you know it or not, the in­
visible Power of God, before which every nega­
tive force or power must vanish.
24. It means that all the wisdom, all the in­
telligence, all the ingenuity, all the resourceful­
ness of the Spirit of God is instantly available to
you. This Power cannot be limited of Itself. It
can be, and is, limited Only by your willingness
to recognize and use It.
25. There is nothing—absolutely nothing—
your Life can need which the Spirit of God in
you cannot manifest, not after you die, but here
and now. That is the reason God put His Spirit
in you. For no other reason. This is the truth
about God.
26. All other theories are false. This truth
was revealed to me, and abundantly proved by me,
through the Power of the Spirit of God. This
prophet knows whereof he speaks.
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 137
138 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
27. Would you like to know how conscious
recognition of the Power of the Spirit of God
may be made known to you? The answer is very-
simple. So simple that you will wonder why you
did not see it before. You will wonder why holy
men ever devised hard, impossible steps up to
God when the way is so plain that even an un­
educated man, like the author, cannot make a
mistake in finding it.
28. You really do nothing. Just give a certain
amount of your time every day. You let the Spirit
of God reveal Itself to you. So, if you would
really know the true way to God, set aside fifteen
minutes to half an hour every day. Do not be
disturbed. Sit in a chair, and completely relax.
Do not think of anything. All human thoughts
should be put completely out of your mind.
29. Quietly sit there. Breathe easily and slow­
ly, and then—LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD
REVEAL ITS PRESENCE TO YOU. All you
do is show your willingness by giving a small por­
tion of your time every day to being alone with
God.
30. It is not possible for you to wait for the
Spirit of God to reveal itself to you every day for
thirty days, and fail. You could do it instantly

had not foreign untrue ideas of God been brought
to the world by holy-men. But forget all about
holy-men. Deal with God direct. Recognize the
Spirit of Life, or God, in you, and give fifteen
minutes of your time every day, waiting for the
Spirit of God to reveal Its presence to you.
31. This is the only way to God. God is in
you. The Spirit of God gives you life. Then keep
quiet enough for the Spirit of God to speak Its
presence to you.
A CLOSING WORD
In silence the Spirit of G od began the
creation of man and this universe billions of years
ago. In silence that creation has proceeded. In
silence it will be completed. Then when the Mas­
ter-Painter has completed the picture and laid His
brushes aside, ’twill be done in the silence which
is the Spirit of God. For God was ever silent.
The vastness of the creations of the Spirit of God
speak loudly, but the Power—it is spiritual Si­
lence. It is the Spirit of God.
When you desire consciousness of the Presence
of the Spirit of God in you, as I have suggested,
get alone. Be alone with God. Be at rest. For at
the center of God is silence and rest. Close your
eyes, breathe slowly, normally, and quietly. Use
the same place for your meditations every day.
Do not attempt to talk with God until there
comes stealing into your life a little tiny bit of
the Great Over-Life which is the Spirit of God
in you.
At the beginning of these little periods alone
with God, put out of your mind every thought.
142 A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
You may have to train yourself to do this, but it
becomes comparatively easy. Then, with no
thoughts running through your head, quietly lis­
ten for the Spirit of God. This Spirit speaks in a
language all Its own, and being a part of God,
and having the Spirit of God living in your body,
you will catch the response as you listen. Make
this a habit. It is pregnant with the Power of
God.
As the weeks and the months go by, the pres­
ence of the Spirit of God will be more and more
pronounced, until it becomes the most real thing
in your life. You will enter into a new life. It
will be a quiet life. God might call you, as he
has me, to busy, active service on the firing line.
But the life under that will remain silent and
quiet. It will be hidden in the overwhelming
peace which God only can give. The world does
not understand this peace. When it comes, treas­
ure it. Lengthen your quiet moments with God.
After a while you can quietly talk with the
Spirit of God in you. When you do, whatever
you desire will come to pass. DO NOT AT­
TEMPT TO PRAY. Rather, listen to what God
has to say to you, and then, strong in the strength
which the Spirit of God will give you, take your
A P R O P H E T S P E A K S 143
place quietly in this scheme of things. Follow
the leadings of the Spirit of God. It will lead.
Where? I do not know. Neither do you. But
you may be sure of one thing—wherever the Spir­
it of God leads you—go, and go quickly.
Now, in conclusion, I send to you the peace of
God. It will shelter you and protect you if you
will but let it. Hide your life in the Great Life
of God, and eternal peace will be yours.

A P R O P H E T S P E A K S
The world is looking for an authentic message from God. The
American people want to know why all this bloodshed should be nec­
essary. Is there no Higher Power? If there is, why cannot this Higher
Power step into this cruel world situation and bring sanity into the
hearts of men?
The answer comes with staggering clarity in this book. The
answer lies in a direction which will surprise its readers, who have
looked for God in the last place God is to be found.
This ghastly war, and every other war men have waged, has
been the result of man’s not knowing where to look for God. So-called
“holy-men” have advocated systems of religion as the method whereby
God may be found. But Dr. Robinson, in this book, discovers God
in an entirely different place.
There will be much confusion and consternation over the release
of this book. Yet every statement in it is not only logical, but true.
They cannot be refuted by any theologian. They are eternal truths
which every reader will recognize as truths the minute he reads them.
The only pathway back to God is disclosed in this book. There
is only one God, and only one pathway to God. That pathway does
not lie where most people expect it to lie. God is not where our
churches say tie is. In fact, God is to be discovered and His Power
too, in the very last place the churches advocate looking for Him.
THIS IS DR. ROBINSON’S 17th BOOK. FOR A
