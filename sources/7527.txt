This other girl and I fell off. I remember being underwater, my head hurting, and was afraid I had hit my head on the other girl's hip. My head hurt so bad I knew I didn't want to pass out cause I was under water but all I could think about was the pain in my head. The next thing I remembered was seeing a crane and thinking someone had drowned and they were pulling them out of the water. When I was closer, I saw a beautiful bright light. I looked into the water and could see the body and recognized it was me. I thought I couldn't have drowned because here I was, I looked toward the light and saw an angel and she said it was time to go back. I didn't want too, I felt like I dropped down into my body. I thought the image was close to the top but I had to swim up a long ways.
