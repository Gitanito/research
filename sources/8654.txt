  	Hello, my name is Mary....the address above   	is my soulmate's who recently passed on last month....Here is our story.....

&nbsp;    	I   	was in Iowa last year living with a Sioux Indian whom I met online, our   	relationship was not working out but before I left, I had a dream of a hawk   	flying into my arms from the direction north.&nbsp; When he hopped off I noticed   	he had blood on the back of his neck feathers and then his back opened up   	and I saw bones but it was also dark in the inside of his body.
  &nbsp;    	I   	returned home to North Carolina in September and one night while I was in my   	favorite chatroom someone entered with the id hawk_in_the_tree.&nbsp; I   	immediately remembered the dream I had previously.&nbsp; I didn't instant message   	him but instead he messaged me and wanted to chat.&nbsp; We discussed our   	spiritual beliefs and found that we shared so much in common, we connected   	very quickly and deeply that night.&nbsp; Our chats continued many times a day   	and phone calls began and by the end of October, I received money from   	Richard for a plane ticket to visit him.&nbsp; I didn't hesitate at all, I   	already knew I loved this man with all my heart and soul and I felt the very   	same love from him.
  &nbsp;    	  	When we finally met face to face the love was even deeper as though we had   	known each other all our lives and beyond.&nbsp; We spent every day in each   	other's arms, talking, loving, and sharing dreams for our future.&nbsp; He had to   	leave for four days to attend his son's wedding in CA and when he returned,   	he was sick, we thought with the flu.&nbsp; By January, he became much worse and   	very large lumps appeared on his body.&nbsp; January the 20th he was diagnosed   	with cancer, our lives were shattered.&nbsp; I cared for him around the clock,   	never leaving his side and March the 25th he passed on.&nbsp; What is so strange   	are the dreams we both had before he passed away.&nbsp; Mine have continued since   	his passing.&nbsp; Many strange things have occurred in the physical as though   	they are messages from him.
  &nbsp;    	I   	will not go into detail of what I feel or believe because this is my   	personal journey.&nbsp; I will say that we our co-creators and can very well   	create our own realities.&nbsp; I do not speak of him as dead nor do I speak of   	him as in the past.&nbsp; He lives in me and my love for him is as strong as it   	was when he was with me in the physical.&nbsp; I will be with him again, that is   	my journey now.&nbsp; I am not angry at my creator, but I am angry at death.&nbsp; I   	once had a dream where my guide told me, &quot;you don't have to die, you have   	the keys, the secret's in the wounds.
  &nbsp;    	  	Our love we have, Richard and I, is so strong, that not even death can   	sever.    	&nbsp;    	  	Mary and my beloved Richard.....    </body>
