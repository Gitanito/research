  		              		Experience Description   

    I lost consciousness and passed out from lack of oxygen. I woke up in white void. There were no ground or physical objects. I felt like I had been having philosophical conversations with an unseen man. He had a reassuring voice that made me feel no doubt or fear. It felt like I was there a very long time. I was interrupted by him and the only words I remember were him telling me “You need to wake up right now, it will be beautiful.” I asked him to repeat what he said and he did. At that point, I realized I was in an out of Body experience and needed to return so I did so with urgency. I instantly woke up and sat up straight to throw up. I asked my friends how long I was out and they said about a minute, but in my head I felt like it was a very long time.
