 	Ostara.
 Bucherei der Blonden und Mannesrechtler.
 Other titles: Ostara Rundschau
 1905-1931
 Vienna, Austria.  Language:  German.  Editor: JÃ¶rg Lanz von Liebenfels (Adolf-Josef Lanz).
 Corporate author:  19311/1, 1905-1931.

 Approximately 95 issues, of which about half were reprinted in Vienna 1926-1931. It was an Ariosophical journal (i.e., a journal devoted to the science of the Aryans) based on the Bible-based ideas  (Lanz von Liebenfehls,1874-1954, was a former Cistercian monk) that dark-haired people were the progeny of Eve and a demon and that the purpose of life was to segregate, sterilize and kill these half-demons.  Blonds, on the other hand, were "divine men," creative and natural leaders.  The journal described itself as "the only illustrated Aryan-Aristocratic and Aryan-Christian journal," and also strongly promoted the idea (as the subtitle indicates)  that the correct state of affairs was the rule of men rather of women.  Sexual fantasy played a principal place in von Liebenfels ideas (e.g., no. 43: "Sexual Physics, or Love as Odic Energie") but there is no indication that sexual energy had any practical application in his work.  The swastika was a recurring symbol in the journal and it had a strong undercurrent of eroticism in both the text and the illustrations.  It also carried a substantial amount of general occult material, especially regular reviews of the works of P. Braun, Franz Hartmann, E.C.H. Peithmann, Karl Brandler-Pracht, "Peryt Shou" (Albert Christian Georg Schultz, 1873-1953), and Dion Fortune, and of a wide spectrum of  contemporary works on astrology, auras, Mazdaznan, the Grail, the Templars, etc.  Utrecht University; Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Den Haag; University of Groninbgen.
