I was very depressed over many issues and felt very alone. The doctor gave me sleeping pills.  Unbeknownst to the doctor, I planned throughout that day that I would take them all. There were twenty nine in the packet. I went to bed that night at 10.00pm. I lived with my parents at that time. It was the following morning my mother came to wake me around 7.30am. She couldn’t and called my father. I was totally unconscious. My mum told me my body had gone into a fitting state before I stopped breathing. However, I remember watching myself above my body looking down. I saw my father come into the room and he was trying to resuscitate me. The next thing I remember is waking up in the ambulance hooked up to heart monitors and oxygen.  I had never believed in out of body experiences until that moment but now I do feel that, yes, there is something out there. I'm not sure what or why. Thankfully, I didn't make it to the other side. I hurt the people I love the most. My family doesn’t talk about that day. I'm not sure if they believe what I saw, but I know my father brought me back.

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?     No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?      Yes     I have had many dreams that have come true and many coincidences have happened. I have said things that will happen to people but it usually happens not to the person intended. For instance I was talking to my employer, and I said I hoped my ex-husband’s bridge would fall off as we’d just split up. I was angry with him. The next day it happened to my employer. I seem to say many things in jest. But in one way or other, it happens. A few of my friends think I'm a witch!

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?    No
