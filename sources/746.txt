 The journal was still being advertised in May 1889 but ceased to appear with the February-March 1889 issue.  Katie L. Swarts, who had taken over the journal in November 1888 after her husband decided, he said, to concentrate on his mail-order "Non-Resident Course," announced in a letter published in Ida A. Nichols’ and Fanny M. Harley’s Christian Science (Chicago) that "circumstances over which I have no control" had forced her to discontinue publication and that unfulfilled subscriptions would be completed by Christian Science.  The Christian Metaphysician in 1889 noted that Swarts had transferred the journal to Katie, who then sold it to Nichols.  For a time, as the journal announced in August 1888, it was the organ of the Cosmopolitan Society of Christian Science ("briefly known as the Society of Science (S.O.S.)") and its Division of the Secret Doctrine of S.O.S. or the Confraternity of Christo-Crucians.   On Swarts, see the note under Mind-Cure and Science of Life.  National Library of Medicine.  Boston Athenaeum; Harvard University; National Library of Medicine.
