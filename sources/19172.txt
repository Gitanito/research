what we&#39;re going to go through today
there&#39;s gonna be two sections to this
the first part is going to be focused on
the add a comma cover-up I&#39;m calling it
now used to be that a common mystery and
the second part is going to be about the
cosmology close encounters of the fifth
kind and an understanding of how the
cosmos actually operates the first half
dealing with the atacama skeleton is an
interesting phenomenon because it turns
out there&#39;s not just one of these but
there are at least two and I just got a
report from Chile last night that
multiple of these small creatures have
been seen by it live and living in these
foothills of the Andes in the Atacama
region the Atacama skeleton was found in
this area of Chile it is about six
inches I found it and at first saw it I
should say
in 2009 I didn&#39;t discover it and nor did
I take it out of Chile regardless of
what the New York Times has been
alleging in reality a treasure hunter
found it in an old ruins of an Indian
village in the foothills of Atacama
region in this area of Chile now this is
an area that the native peoples had
reported seeing small people which they
called the Gentiles it&#39;s an interesting
term they use for them for centuries and
perhaps millennia and it had also been
associated with seen UFOs this it was
actually taken in the area right over
where this atacama skeleton was found
and there are very unusual objects that
are seen going in and out of the Andes
that are luminous partially materialized
objects sometimes fully materialized and
the report I received last night from a
researcher who
I have credit this photograph and a lot
of this information to Alex Qian Ettie
thank you is that there are reports of
these being seen recently by people in
that area as living organisms and the
one that I want to show you next this is
the one that is in the possession of a
man in Barcelona and he was a man who
went to Chile met the treasure hunter
who had been sifting through these old
ruins from the late 1800s Early 1900s in
mining towns looking for treasures
basically old artifacts and in a in a
pouch in one of them someone had
preserved and saved this now I first
learned of this in 2009 it was found in
2003 and the public knew some of the
information on it beginning in 2004 and
five in the studies some studies were
done in Europe showing that it was in
fact a not human the anthropologists had
found that there was wear on the some of
the connective tissues still remaining
on the feet that it had walked around
etc and so on however no thorough
genetic testing had been done cause to
do the genetic testing requires damaging
this very unusual skeleton I was invited
first just to view it and when I first
saw it I put it in my hand and I have
big hands size 9 surgical gloves anyway
so and it was it was six inches it did
not take up my whole hand and I looked
at this and I knew immediately that this
was not a model or a fake or
what-have-you I knew that this was an
actual had been had been a living
organism and so we examined it looked at
it photographed it made a connection
with Ramon in Barcelona who owned
and we kept the dialogue going in 2012 I
was able to convince him to allow us to
come over with a technical and sort of
surgical team and take samples of the
bone and be able to get bone marrow that
could then be extracted and run through
some genetic tests to see if it matches
or didn&#39;t match to any known species on
earth now during that time we got a
bunch of x-rays and cat scans and you&#39;ll
see that it has very different
appearance to a fetus or newborn baby
and if you look carefully at this you
will also see that on a newborn and a
fetus the bones are very very thin
they&#39;re rubbery this is the neon the
Atacama humanoid will get into this and
what you&#39;ll also find is that the skull
has four bones and we have six the
Atacama has ten we have 12 etc it&#39;s
grossly obviously different from a human
now the question was then what is it for
the record I have never stated it is of
extraterrestrial origin we do not know
what this is but the hatchet job done at
Stanford and UCSF and genome research
magazine which is atrocious on the reefs
on this study is going to get exposed
very quickly and this is me holding up
the skeleton and when you see it look at
the extent of the calcification and how
opaque it is the amount of calcium in
those bones is consistent with a small
child because when you&#39;re in utero there
is not much calcium in those
they&#39;re very cartilaginous meaning like
cartilage there&#39;s wide newborn babies
I&#39;m a trauma doctor when there&#39;s a
terrible accident they&#39;re amazing
they&#39;re like Gumby bears they can move
and do this and if they don&#39;t have a
broken bone why because they don&#39;t have
a high degree of calcification which you
have as you get older and there are a
lot of technical reasons for this having
to do with osteoblasts and things that
will put in general audience to sleep I
will not go into but it&#39;s important to
note that and the very first thing the
radiologist in Barcelona when we pulled
this off the x-ray machine out of the
cat scanner they all went my god this is
not a fetus they had assumed this little
thing had to be an ejected of our
aborted fetus 22 weeks 28 weeks they
said this was a child and it was up
running around it had a pith seal plates
what our app if Asiya plates app if a
seal plates are in where the long bones
and you will see that there&#39;s a place
what&#39;s called a growth plate and you
know when you&#39;re growing the bones have
to grow because there&#39;s a growth plate
in the long bones that allows them to
continue to grow and lay down new bone
and get longer and longer as we get
taller and taller as we reach our full
mature height those Epistle plates are
consistent with the six to eight year
old human child in terms of
developmental stage there is a another
one look at the skull and look at the
overlapping helmet like a feature if you
look at the skull sutures and the way a
large skull bone comes over to like a
point and overlaps it&#39;s identical to the
atacama skeleton this is from Russia
from 1996 a separate small person being
that was found running around that a
woman captured unfortunately
kept it in captivity tried to feed it
yogurt it died and was subsequently
autopsy I understand that it was later
confiscated by some authorities after
initial
tests had been done it&#39;s bigger this is
an adult skull is the same essentially
as the Atacama now what&#39;s important
about that is that if there are two of
these it rules out a singular genetic
mutation of a human embryo there&#39;s no
way it isn&#39;t going to happen be one in a
quadrillion chances interestingly it was
the assistant of dr. Gary Nolan at
Stanford who had offered to do an honest
examination of this genetically who
found this Russians bean and then I had
another researcher send it to me and I
recalled that in 1996 when I was over in
England I was told about this but by the
time I wanted to go over to Russia to
get it it had been seized and it had
vanished we do not know where it is now
I hear different stories of where it is
one account is that it was buried on the
shore of the Black Sea and other is that
it&#39;s in the KGB&#39;s or FS B&#39;s hands we do
not know it&#39;s not available for
examination which means all we have are
these images now this means that with
two of them we really have a phenomenon
of something that is a creature that
it&#39;s a humanoid or human-like creature
unjust not described in the medical
literature or not described in the
scientific literature anywhere and so
this became even more of a mystery I
will let you just peruse this this is
from dr. Ralph
Lockman now he is sort of the world&#39;s
expert on skeletal abnormalities and in
children and actually literally wrote
the textbook and he reviewed all the
x-rays and all the cat scans and he came
to the conclusion it was a six to eight
year old child that the chances that it
was progeria which is a type of genetic
condition where you age your bones
rapidly and could be
you know younger than that is extremely
small and he had never seen anything
like this and this from the man at both
UCLA and Stanford who is the professor
who is the world&#39;s expert on skeletal
dysplasias abnormalities in this in the
skeleton in children and it matched new
genetic syndrome so by this point and
this was in the fall of 2012 we knew we
had something significant I went and got
the bone marrow in September
late September 2012 the DNA was handed
off along with these images to Stanford
and to dr. Noland in October of 2012 and
then it seems everything fell apart now
you can read these for yourself where
he&#39;s basically saying that the chances
this is a you know a chance of
spontaneous chance to mutation or
infinitesimally small and we had
discussions where he said essentially we
don&#39;t know what this is but the chances
it could be a mutation from just a
singular event in a human embryo are
infinitesimal and we began to look
forward to these genetic workups and
this is an extensive area of esoteric
science we&#39;re not going to go into the
arcane nature of it this was worrisome
one month later 3.2 million dollar grant
award the teal award was granted to
Nolan in his lab from the Department of
Defense I have an assistant who
supporter who found this I did not know
that until a few weeks ago I thought
well you know it&#39;s not proof of anything
it&#39;s worrisome because by the time he
began to start running the genetic tests
and workups
it seems that he had been told by
someone to say it was a deformed human
and that&#39;s what you will read in the New
York Times and on CNN and the BBC that
came out in March what was most
worrisome and I haven&#39;t talked about
this until now when serious premiered
five years ago April 24th it made quite
a stir for almost an entire week if this
was the number one story on The
Huffington Post the major news media the
view were all contacting me to have
interviews dr. Nolan went out to the
public and stated don&#39;t worry it&#39;s a
deformed human the day of the premiere
and the release of the movie serious
which many of you helped fund of course
I was shocked by this betrayal
since the work had not been done
properly yet all the evidence has
suggested it was not but it&#39;s submarined
the film its submarined
and torpedoed the entire launch of
Sirius which was part of our disclosure
effort and none of the mainstream media
would cover this after that because case
closed
it&#39;s a deformed human a year later he&#39;s
at the Society for scientific
explanation
and we&#39;ll just take a listen I reached
out to Steven he actually within about
10 or 15 minutes I got a email reply
back and then we basically went to a
little bit of a negotiation as to what
terms would be under which I would
analyze this and one of the things that
I promised him that I would not come at
this with a hyper skeptical way of
analyzing or looking at it and not throw
it out and not throw out the baby with
the bathwater at the moment I found
something that made it look like it was
only human or was not anomalous in any
way and to this day I&#39;m not going to so
I&#39;m not going to make a pronouncement of
what this thing is I&#39;m going to give you
enough data to make your own decisions
this is a year later meanwhile at some
point during this period he hooks up
with this group now this is a man who
stayed at my home he was the lead one of
the lead men in the group blink 182 he I
sort of mentored him when he was a young
man teenager and older he flew me and
three of my four daughters to a concert
in Pittsburgh with him and we hung out
went over Joshua Tree with him with his
band and you know there are a lot of
people in the music and film world who
follow what we&#39;re doing obviously and
what was worrisome is that somewhere
between the early 2000s and now he got
contacted by a number of people in the
intelligence community such as general
McCaskill if you look at the WikiLeaks
Podesta hack during the Trump Clinton
campaign where he was getting
information from this wright-patterson
Air Force Base general about the subject
all of it tailor-made to make him make
the assessment have the assessment that
there isn&#39;t any alien threat that we
need to worry about
what happened is that like so many
people who look into this subject they
get sucked into what I call the black
hole of disinformation that has been
pre-positioned out there that if you
look into the UFO subject and then the
extra-terrestrial subject you will be
pulled into what is 90 plus percent
pre-positioned intelligence community
created disinformation designed to have
people hate anything not human and
unfortunately he got brainwashed in that
direction subsequently he founded a
group which will go through just quickly
some of these gentlemen and what you
find is CIA jimsim even you can put off
now I&#39;ve known about dr. put off for
decades he does zero-point energy
research he&#39;s worked for every
three-letter agency his closest friend
told me personally that he knew we
already had these technologies but that
if he were to bring them forward he
would be killed along with his family
and children and but he is an operative
for the intelligence community and also
a physicist another one aerospace
division Lockheed Martin skunk works
this gentleman who you&#39;ve seen on the
news with the December New York Times
CNN release of gun camera footage is a
man described to me by my sources in the
Pentagon in CIA as a master of
counterintelligence and as you all know
now he headed up this threat assessment
division at the Pentagon dealing with
UFOs now this gentleman is in the
circles that I&#39;m connected to very much
someone who they pick
to go forward to provide
counterintelligence and false
information or partial information to
the public
Chris Mellon distant relative of Paul
Mellon who helped found the CIA with
Allen Dulles I&#39;m good friends with his
it one of his distant cousins who is the
son of Senator John Warner a member of
the magic committee along with Bush
Senior and
Dick Cheney and others this gentleman
recently wrote an op-ed in the
Washington Post stating that the
Pentagon ought to look into this subject
but he didn&#39;t understand why they
weren&#39;t well meanwhile I know people who
work in the Pentagon in the Defense
Intelligence Agency and in every agency
in the sub-basement and other off-site
locations that are reverse engineering
extraterrestrial spacecraft that we have
downed using electromagnetic weapons and
yet this man who had been a senior
official of the Pentagon as well as on
the staff of Senator John Warner is
writing op-ed pieces saying well we
don&#39;t really know what this is we&#39;ll
call them you a piece unexplained aerial
phenomenon well this is the new term
instead of UFO both of which are fake
terms because they&#39;re not unidentified
at all and they&#39;re not unexplained they
want you to believe it&#39;s unexplained and
unidentified it&#39;s not true mind-control
using words to control how you think and
then of course my friend who assured me
that he would do an impartial study on
this atacama skeleton who is a senior a
tenured professor at Stanford University
and holds the Harris chair it&#39;s a 10
million dollar endowment and I have met
tristin Harris who is very well known in
the tech world and Tristan Harris is
someone who is very much
aware of this subject and we&#39;ll get into
that in a moment let&#39;s go through the
rest of these quickly you can just see
who was CIA next CIA next in the
interest of time we don&#39;t go through all
these Department of Defense next and on
and on and on now what&#39;s worrisome about
this well I heard as soon as this
information came out in December and it
started being covered globally about
this case off the California coast of
jets with footage of a UFO zipping along
and moving in a non aerodynamic way I
was contacted by a source who&#39;s been
with the CIA for 30 40 years and he sent
me an email and he said to me we good we
he said this is the rat pack that has
been running scams I&#39;m quoting from the
email on the public and the US
government for decades but we hope their
force will soon dissipate there&#39;s very
cryptic I knew by the way before that
film footage in December that was on the
New York Times and CNN and other world
media that that was coming out and that
this group was facilitating that release
but behind the release isn&#39;t just the
information because the follow-on
interviews that these people have done
have all been about a threat it&#39;s all
within the context of a threat why
because if there&#39;s a threat it supports
a military-industrial international
cabal who
wants a bigger enemy than the Taliban
and Isis the fight and that&#39;s what&#39;s
coming and this is what you have to be
aware of this has been fast-tracked now
this is on a fast track and I have that
confirmed by the highest levels of the
intelligence community so come March
22nd 26 somewhere in that period on the
online version of this journal genome
research is the article that submarines
the atacama humanoid and with it they
wished my credibility now what&#39;s
important about this is that genome
research magazine it&#39;s associated with
Cold Spring Harbor which is where Watson
and Crick you know discovered who DNA
unfortunately this journal which is
supposedly peer-reviewed did not do any
proper peer review of the article and we
improve this now what happened is that
it turns out that this genome research
is sort of a lower tier scientific
journal compared to cell or nature or
some of the others but the authors were
prestigious enough that they ran it
through and published it and rush to
publish it
five years after Noland had already told
the media it was a deformed human and in
this article he says well it&#39;s alien
baby syndrome there are seven
spontaneous all at once mutations that
happened in utero and that it&#39;s a
deformed female fetus that was aborted
at around 22 weeks absolutely not true
he also states that it was from 40 years
ago that this skeleton had been sitting
in the desert the people who actually
excavated it found it in strata of
remains of an archaeological site dating
from the late 1800s to about 1930 he
also claims that we told him
that it was thousands of years old which
no one ever did we knew it was it so
there was one misrepresentation after
another after another and I knew
something was very wrong when I&#39;m with I
was at my daughter&#39;s one of my
daughter&#39;s homes and this had broken we
had a phone call from my wife&#39;s brother
who is an academic in Boston and says
well see this thing your husband was
pursuing it&#39;s just all nonsense its
assist a deformed fetus and I&#39;m look I&#39;m
reading the article in The New York
Times I didn&#39;t know I was shocked I said
what so somehow this cabal the Gary&#39;s
gotten connected to the to the Stars
Academy arranged for any bit of
information that comes out will be on
the front pages of the New York Times
Washington Post CNN meanwhile
unacknowledged which is the top
documentary in the world that actually
exposes the truth about this issue
blacklisted and isn&#39;t covered very
strange this is when we had proof that
the intelligence community completely
owns the media and they owned them lock
stock and barrel when it comes to
anything this sensitive and so we&#39;re on
our own now friends it&#39;s up to us
because this monstrous cabal has
absolutely seen to it that the
falsehoods are gonna Trump the truth now
look at the coverage all over the world
and on the wick my WikiLeaks page it
says this is a deformed human I can&#39;t
get it changed we tried to change it but
WikiLeaks is mobbed up to I mean not
what he leaks Wikipedia so what you find
is that there is an orchestration of a
release of information mixed with this
information coming from what the CIA
official calls the Rat Pack that&#39;s been
running scams on the public for decades
it&#39;s very worrisome and it also means
that we are going to have to do this
through the alternative
of media all right and that&#39;s what we
have to set upon doing now this is
something if you wish to read any of
this you can unless you have a PhD in
molecular biology or genetics or an MD I
think it would be inscrutable
but let me tell you the shock of my life
had happened a few weeks ago not one but
multiple people contacted me from the
academic world and said that article
that&#39;s in genome research magazine
that&#39;s gotten worldwide coverage junk
science start-finish one gentleman who
is a man who literally has a Caltech PhD
in genetics who had worked with Watson
Sanger had done the pioneering work on
x-ray crystallography of DNA etc
contacted me urgently and said dr. Greer
this is something very wrong here and
one of the first emails he says as a
non-expert might not have noticed it but
I&#39;m fairly sure that Noland and
colleagues plant a fake analysis from
the beginning they included lots of
random mutations in their sequences by
intent by omitting a standard treatment
to remove them what is he talking about
well he sent me an article that come out
over ten years ago that was about old
DNA so there&#39;s DNA you take out of your
body when it&#39;s living there&#39;s DNA that
you get from a skeleton that&#39;s been
laying in the desert like that a comma
for decades totally different treatment
of that because once it&#39;s out in the
environment not in a preserved
environment not in a cryogenic lab there
is rapid oxidation and degradation of
that DNA and everyone in genetics knows
this so you have to do controls at the
very beginning that are very inexpensive
and very fast to find out how many of
these have been oxidized and how many
base pairs have switched with each other
to see what the damage to the
because otherwise you&#39;re going to call
that damage of mutation which is exactly
what they did
deliberately they took damage that any
body in a ph.d program nevermind someone
with that a professor level at UCSF and
Stanford would have caught and they
called it mutations of a fetus now this
is not my opinion this is the opinion of
the scientists so we have two separate
peer reviews now and the peer review
system usually works where they put the
information out but they leave their
names off of it and frankly both of
these men want to stay out of this
scandal but their their pedigree is
impeccable and when I talk to the one
the first one who contacted me he said
dr. Greer you would have to have been
someone who walked off the street into
that lab at Stanford not to have known
this and to have done this he says is a
academic corruption scandal like he has
never seen in his career is an elderly
man and I said yeah I know that but I&#39;m
not a geneticist
I don&#39;t have a PhD from UCSF I have a
daughter who does in genetics
neuroscience but I am a doctor medical
doctor and so I understand the principle
what he was explaining I said well this
is a huge problem then because we have
now the worldwide media covering this
atacama skeleton calling it a human when
it isn&#39;t now in and of itself the
atacama being isn&#39;t that important
there&#39;s plenty of evidence if you look
at all the material we&#39;ve collected for
UFOs extraterrestrial right then why am
I even delt dwelling with this because
this is a case study and how the
intelligence community will try to
sideline actual disclosure and have a
clear field for the fake disclosure
that&#39;s coming that will be based on a
false flag operation that will be false
false from start to finish we&#39;ll have a
whole
of actual evidence but surrounded by the
atmospherics of a threat that&#39;s alien
we&#39;re going to get into this later so
without going into all the details he
also explained the second person who
contacted me number two is a PhD
geneticist who has worked in academic
and government centers and then started
genome sequencing companies now he was
right down the road from Stanford in
Mountain View this is perhaps one of the
great world experts in genome sequencing
and he said he had contacted Nolan and
his team to do a reference free sequence
of the entire genome of the atacama
skeleton what does that mean it means
that without prejudice you take the
genetic material and you run the entire
genome now this takes massive
computational we&#39;re talking about
billions of base pairs in the DNA but
you do the entire mapping and you do a
read that ends up with you know like 90
billion reads very in-depth he offered
to do this for them was turned down
when Sirius came out said no we won&#39;t do
it
another geneticist contacted me and said
he had offered before that to help them
do a proper genetic analysis and had
also been turned away and these were
people who just wanted to know the truth
of what is this thing is it human is it
some other primate is it
extraterrestrial is it a hybrid is it
what the heck is it because no one knew
what this was and you know what we still
don&#39;t know and that&#39;s the tragedy here
so ultimately once this happened and I
think this is where
we get into the deeper part of the
intelligence community and the media
cooperation and academia that we have to
begin to understand and not be naive
about that what you are told in the
public and what actually happens is
almost never related to the truth on any
subject I&#39;ve been intimate with and
known the details of none of it so what
we have to begin to understand we&#39;re
living in the Truman Show we&#39;re sort of
like going around you know so Jim Carrey
in The Truman Show you nut movie and we
think we know how the world works how
the government works how the media works
or even what science is
we don&#39;t we&#39;ve been told absolutely a
myth and this is time for us to it&#39;s
time for us to change that once and for
all if we understand what these men are
saying and I understand it they&#39;re
actually more blunt in person where they
say this is corruption this is
scientific corruption this was fraud at
the beginning now I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m
saying is that we and I have a letter in
my possession here that I have just
completed this week that is going to the
Provost of Stanford and to UCSF and to
Cold Spring Harbor genome research and
in it it&#39;s a three-page letter that lays
this out and it is basically demanding
that they return any genetic material to
us because we&#39;re not going to get more
of it that there be a retraction of this
journal that they reimburse us for do
you crowdfunded tens of thousands of
dollars to go over and do this study on
this the public did and we have all been
deceived and this needs to be corrected
so this is also going to go to various
federal agencies because I have a mole
inside UCSF University California in San
Francisco who I will not name
who is discovering that there apparently
have been misuse of federal dollars in
this endeavor so this could end up being
a massive scandal so I&#39;m asking for the
academic corruption of this to be
investigated to see where the science
went wrong and to find out how the
cherry-picking
of the DNA happened what do I mean by
that well one of these gentlemen the
genome sequencing expert just one
example this is one out of pages and
pages of material these experts have
sent me weird diploid right you know we
have two sets of chromosomes our alleles
are diploid where there are ones that
are triploid there&#39;s f3
the Atacama turns out had 360,000
triploid reads they were all thrown out
and and dismissed as I&#39;m not important
now this is in the data if you drill
down into the attachments to this paper
now normally if you were to take a
reading at ninety billion you know
reads out on a fresh human DNA sample
there might be 200 that just happened
due to programming error or something
yeah the 90 bill you&#39;re gonna have that
this is 360,000 triploid on only a small
amount of DNA they studied the other
thing they did was to extrapolate on a
very small amount of the DNA sequence
the entire genome of this creature
instead of running the entire genome so
instead of a 90 billion read-through
there were 509 million so that&#39;s a
fraction like quite 0.2% and then
there&#39;s this mystery when the first
initial run was done I was contacted by
Nolan II he said this is only matching
89 to 91 percent with humans and maybe
less than that by time we do deeper
reads the head of this genome sequencing
company about the time the film series
came out
he called Nolan at Stanford was towed it
was down to 70 to 80% now it&#39;s believed
it may be a fraction of 1% matching it
is not at all what we&#39;ve been told now
I&#39;m not gonna drill down in a public
setting with all the esoteric genetic
sequencing technology but one thing that
has been said by all the scientists
who&#39;ve looked at this is that deliberate
cherry-picking of the data was done
antiquated techniques and technology was
used even though state-of-the-art was
offered and then you have Nolan hooking
up with this group filled with CIA and
Department of Defense people publishes
this in a little-known journal that gets
worldwide media coverage on something
this obscure why because as the father
of the disclosure movement globally they
need to neutralize me and if they won&#39;t
do it through an assassin they&#39;ll do it
this way so that&#39;s what this is actually
about to that end we won&#39;t go there too
far but we have to understand there&#39;s
nothing new Under the Sun with this and
I just want to show you the kind of
covers that happen from this
counterintelligence master at the
Pentagon
Elizondo don&#39;t you have some of you may
have seen this on CNN purpose of the
program advanced aerospace threat
identification program was really
designed to do just that
from a national security perspective
identify those things that we see
whether we see them electro-optical ii
we see them with radar we see them as as
eyewitness reports through a myriad of
different ways and avenues that we
receive the information and try to
ascertain and determine if that
information is a potential threat to
national security
in a nutshell so what did you find
well we found a lot I think I think it&#39;s
probably been a little bit
mischaracterized in some
the social media you see and and and
what people put out because a lot of
times when we don&#39;t have a lot of
information we tend to fill in those
gaps with what we think is logical and
they&#39;re still by the way a lot we really
don&#39;t know I think what&#39;s important is
that we have identified some very very
interesting anomalous type of aircraft
let&#39;s call them aircraft things that
don&#39;t have any obvious flight surfaces
any obvious forms of propulsion and
maneuvering in ways that include extreme
maneuverability beyond I would submit
the healthy g-forces of a human or
anything biological hypersonic
velocities low observability positive
lift again seemingly in defying the laws
of aerodynamics I will tell you
unequivocally
that that through the observation
scientific methodologies that were
applied to to look at this phenomena
that these aircraft will call am
aircraft are displaying characteristics
that are not currently within the u.s.
inventory nor in any foreign inventory
that that we are aware of so I know
you&#39;re using your being clear but I mean
the answer is yes my personal I can&#39;t
speak on behalf of the government
obviously I&#39;m not in the US government
anymore my personal belief is that there
is very compelling evidence that we we
may not be alone whatever that means
basically in this interview you know
he&#39;s talking about this case he&#39;s sort
of but there&#39;s also this imply but we
don&#39;t really know what these are but
it&#39;s a UFO was of craft and now this is
someone who has worked in compartment
operations dealing directly with
extraterrestrial information and yet he
will say partial truth to the public the
key here is you don&#39;t lie about
everything you just lie about the most
important things because if you can coat
the poison pill with enough truth people
will swallow the rest of the message
which is there&#39;s a threat from outer
space
and that is what is happening next so
along comes this movie came out a year
ago many of you have seen it most of you
it took we went viral
thanks to you because of that you had
this billionaire in Las Vegas Robert
Billy Bigelow put on 60 minutes within
weeks he was the one who would receive
twenty two million dollars from this
secret office in the Pentagon headed up
by Elizondo to look into UFOs and
there&#39;s a lot of very questionable
activity there then you find the
formation of the tts a to the stars
Academy with Tom DeLonge and the Rat
Pack as it has been called then you have
what happens in December worldwide
release puts them on the radar and then
in March the submarining of the original
disclosure effort with the atacama
cover-up that&#39;s the time sequence this
is something of historical note to those
of you who study this issue and it&#39;s
from the 50s and it&#39;s the Robertson
panel and some of you may have heard of
this and like the Condon committee in
the 60s that ended Project Blue Book
this was a committee put together of
alleged scientists who actually were
tasked by the CIA to debunk the issue
and also to enlist astronomers to its
rope hype hands in the sky and take
photographs of them that would look like
pictures of actual UFOs so that they
could say see that&#39;s all that was
someone just threw a pie pan in the sky
that is literally stated in this
document I have the entire whatever it
is 30 pages of the Robertson panel CIA
report the cover-up that has been done
in the scientific community in collusion
with the intelligence community is
stunning and breathtaking and it goes
back
60 more than 60 years since before I was
born so this is not a new phenomenon
unfortunately it is the oldest trick in
the book and you take people who have
significant scientific credentials you
then put them on your payroll or give
them other inducements I don&#39;t know what
happened at Stanford and UCSF exactly
that&#39;s why we need an investigation we
do know there was a 3.2 million dollar
department defense award within a month
of us handing the DNA off which is
highly suspicious but this has happened
before now we can look at this this next
slide if you read the disclosure project
material dr. Robert Woods was a
McDonnell Douglas aerospace engineer PhD
I knew mr. McDonald the Chairman
personally he had been asked to be on
the Condon committee which in 1969 had
been put together by the Air Force to
study UFOs and became a foil or a front
to shut down the public relations office
on UFOs in the Air Force which is all
Project Blue Book was primarily at least
the part the public knew about and dr.
Woods was actually bringing hard
evidence like we have brought forward
that the UFOs are real some are
interplanetary here&#39;s the evidence here
the radar tracings here are the landings
here&#39;s all this evidence so professor
Condon at the University of Colorado
arranged to have him fired from
McDonnell Douglas he personally went to
the chairman of McDonnell Douglas
aerospace and said I want this man fired
and tried to terminate his career for
bringing the truth to this alleged
scientific study at the University of
Colorado this is a fact I have a CIA
document that states that dr. Condon was
on the payroll of the CIA and that this
could not be known by the public all the
while the media the academic community
the ivory tower people are going I see
this committee of esteemed
astrophysicists and astronomers and
scientists of study this there&#39;s nothing
to it so they shut down Project Blue
Book and the cover for them doing so was
the Condon committee and dr. Woods is on
tape and we have this in our book in
unacknowledged the book and in the movie
being attempting to be fired by the
professor Condon who went over his head
directly to the Chairman a McDonnell
Douglas which has now became part of
Boeing luckily mr. McDonald liked dr.
Woods did not fire him and kept him on
but he was thrown dr. Woods was thrown
off the Condon committee and so I became
friendly with several of them Roy Craig
and a couple of others and I concluded
that this was not an objective study so
I wrote a letter to Condon suggesting
that it might be helpful if he would
establish his group in two parts and
have one the believers in one of
disbeliever ISM that was up good work
with their angles and said I&#39;m taking
the liberty of sending this a copy of
this letter to every member of your
group whose addresses hydrous received
from them privately and he was so
furious at that that he called up james
s mcdonnell who was at that time the the
chairman of the newly merged Douglas and
McDonald aircraft companies and tried to
get me fired really I found this out
three years later from my boss who
apparently number one reported that
McDonald said I don&#39;t like other people
meddling in my business so that was nice
to hear from the CEO Eddie and he asked
the original question well what did he
do and the answer is he wrote a letter
and he wrote a letter that had been
approved through my management because
that them that&#39;s why
so there to anyone who didn&#39;t stay with
the party line of what the intelligence
community wanted them to say who were
acted Domitian&#39;s scientists were thrown
off the committee well that&#39;s not an
impartial committee that&#39;s a dog and
pony show worthy of the show trials of
the Soviet Union and their lowest nadir
but we do the same thing and now it&#39;s
been done to us that&#39;s why this case is
important we are watching the robertson
committee the Condon committee being
played out in real time within the last
two months from Stanford UCSF genome
research magazine the Rat Pack the
intelligence community submarining what
could be one of the most important cases
of physical proof of a nonhuman humanoid
like human-like being
this should concern everyone so that&#39;s
what has happened now you know people
say well how can they pull this off I
mean is it really possible this is more
from these reports and these are all in
my collection I have thousands of pages
of this you know after i briefed a CI
director I did a request not through
normal FOIA and got a box this big
thousands of pages of documents need an
intern to sort them through and scan
them but you&#39;ve to scan them you can&#39;t
read them because they&#39;re such bad
quality anyway they have to be
transcribed so but we have a huge catch
of it and and this is this that these
are official documents these are not at
the provenance isn&#39;t and this is you
know from the CIT we have two more
interesting clips and this man who is
himself a counterintelligence agent many
people don&#39;t like that we used his
testimony in the unacknowledged film but
he is trying to come clean on a lot of
things and in it he talks about in this
particular segment they are forcing
Office of Special Investigations at a
Kirkland Air Force Base over here in New
Mexico that they would you know bring
cash
to pay off national and local news
editors particularly ones dealing with
national security to get the story they
wanted from the media he did this
personally bags of cash satchels of cash
and he stopped short of saying how much
we said large sums very large sum so
every news agency every television radio
station and the Albuquerque Santa Fe
area had our snitches in there so we
knew and we paid him we paid a good
money one of the one of the reasons you
get the people is you pay him and and
that was controversial that was somewhat
controversial you know of national media
had awesome yes yes yeah I&#39;m not going
to name him yeah the high level
producers and directors yeah and were
they
- yeah pay what you do is you make him
sign a form and you tell him you got to
report this IRS but whether they do it
or not you&#39;re not gonna give your form
to IRS I paid I paid no I better not say
there were some of them are large so the
media has people within it who are
really on the payroll of the
intelligence community who are posing to
be impartial journalists and they are
not and in this next slide you&#39;ll see
that in unacknowledged we have a
gentleman who was is a constitutional
attorney Daniel Sheehan who says when he
back in many years ago he was involved
in the Pentagon Papers and representing
the New York Times in the civil case
with that and he states point-blank that
there were he saw a document of 40 -
there were 42 people on the payroll of
the CIA who were senior editors in
national security writers and editors
for the major media around the world on
the payroll of the CIA there&#39;s a finding
that the pike committee made that they
they had verified 42 full-time Central
Intelligence Agency paid employees that
were inserted inside the major national
news media centers and most of them
ended up being the so-called national
security reporters you know reporters
for Time magazine who told me
specifically the they&#39;ve provided the
stories and their editors have spiked
them so how hard is it for them to pull
a stunt like this induce or threaten
someone and then they kind of big sticks
and big carrots to say whatever they
want them to say and then hit a button
and it&#39;s global news on CNN New York
Times that&#39;s what&#39;s happened and I think
any one American British because this is
a worldwide story happening should be
deeply concerned at this level
corruption in academia in the media and
in government because it means that we
do not have a chance until we call them
out on this and this is what we need
help
I am calling for investigators and
people who are top legal litigators
lawyers to join with me in taking this
issue on because this has the
opportunity of exposing the modus
operandi the means of corruption that
has been going on for 60 or 70 years by
these folks and it&#39;s time that we get to
the bottom of it so here we have this
little atacama person and I think that I
want to go through what I think really
we have lost as a civilization this what
I did in the last hours just give you
the big picture now I want to drill down
what if this is some other type of being
not human or extraterrestrial
maybe it&#39;s of one of the wee people they
talk about in Ireland who knows I mean
I&#39;m only half joking because in the
interests of science if you&#39;re going to
be a scientist
you&#39;re supposed to pursue the truth you
don&#39;t say what something is before you
begun your investigation which is what
happened here so I wanted us to take a
step back and realize how profound the
damage to science and also to the media
and to our freedoms of this sort of
thing happening because when you have
geneticists of the caliber who come
forward saying this had to be faked from
the beginning this is academic
corruption this is the worst junk
science they&#39;d ever seen by the way
there are ten other PhD molecular
biologists and geneticists who have
looked at this research who said it&#39;s
just complete they didn&#39;t want to waste
the time on it it was so obviously false
they&#39;d want to waste their time because
it takes days and days and days to drill
down on the data and on the own all
these files now who&#39;s paying attention
the writers at the New York Times know
they&#39;re told go cover this story they
cover it they don&#39;t know they&#39;re just
sort of cogs in the machine well you
know there used to be a band called Rage
Against the Machine we need to kind of
stand up to this machining pushback now
because the machine is about to roll
over the entire planet in a way that you
can&#39;t believe and the thing that I&#39;m
most concerned about right now is that
there is there are no checks and
balances except the disclosure project
which I founded back in the 1990&#39;s but
the National Press Club was 17 years ago
this month on May 9th and what I have
found is it&#39;s been hijacked by a number
of elements in the intelligence
community and people who are just
frankly posers and clowns the problem
with that is that because we know that
we have we have proven in the last 12
months that a film like unacknowledged
which is very hard-hitting evidence
driven military witness testimony
photographs documents it&#39;s all going to
be blacklisted by the mainstream media
right but it doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t
succeed because thank god there&#39;s the
alternative media and there&#39;s you and me
and we can do it and just bypass CNN and
bypass the New York Times but it means
that we&#39;re going to have to do some
strategizing to do that well and to do
it effectively
because we need at least 1 percent of
the global population to begin to awaken
to this 1% 7.5 to have 75 million people
and why is that because they have found
that in scientific quantum physics phase
transition studies you need about 1% of
a substrate the best I like is the super
fluidity and helium we&#39;re at a certain
getting down the near absolute zero you
have this effect where you have
coherence of molecules that line up in a
container of helium and when about 1% is
reached the entire now just before this
it becomes very violent very unstable
very chaotic and then bang at that 1%
point there is coherence massive field
coherence we need that 1% coherence 75
million people globally in this country
it would be you know 1% of 330 million
is 3.3 million so the only way we&#39;re
going to get there is to get the truth
to that number of people and get them
moving in the same direction coherently
does this make sense to you because we
are sort of a macrocosm of the quantum
state each of us as we collectively act
speak think meditate whatever we do and
that&#39;s really how we can make a big
transition on this planet to a new
civilization otherwise we&#39;re slated for
an extinction level event and I think
that this I&#39;ll get into in a moment it
has already been approved this event
I&#39;ve just gotten a briefing on it in the
last month but we you know we have
little time III think that
we the people of the planet are gonna
have to take control of this from the
fascists I was sharing in the the green
room before started with some friends
that there&#39;s a man who I&#39;ve been working
with for year and a half or so who&#39;s the
son of a member of this committee this
magic majority intelligence committee
and his family included him he&#39;s the
grandson of Paul melon and at the end of
World War two
Paul melon went with your General Patton
went over to Germany and got the secret
weapon that they were working on which
was a there&#39;s the Nazi bell you&#39;ve heard
of there&#39;s also a disc they were not
fully operational but they were making
progress but we got the atomic bomb
first point set matched
war ends but does it did it it did not
what this gentleman has told me is that
his entire family are fascists they
supported Adolf Hitler up to the day we
declared war and then they got back the
fascist and put them into our system in
the United States and so it has come to
pass if you think otherwise you are
deluded here is the fact of that George
Patton himself wanted that technology
disclosed to the public because he saw
the benefits it would bring to humanity
because of that this group had him
assassinated George Patton was
assassinated it also means that the
foundations of much of what we call the
CIA they do the conventional work most
of the men and women in the Pentagon and
CIA are fine people but there is a
rotten core that needs to be checked and
checked quickly or we are all in very
big trouble I mean major trouble in
October I got an urgent call from these
folks that at a meeting put the director
of the CIA
Pompeyo and with two people known to us
at the meeting this issue of disclosure
and unacknowledged came up and there was
a woman at the meeting who was not named
to me I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s the person who
is going through hearings right now to
beat the director of the CIA who stopped
the conversation and said oh yes the
American people like to have things to
complain about pretty soon we&#39;re gonna
really give them something to whine
about ominously very ominous Lee now
this was an October that I learned of
this and this is may in the intervening
period the December New York Times CNN
Rat Pack story the submarining of
serious and of the disclosure project
globally and I have found that there are
two factions within the intelligence
community who have green-lighted
disclosure and what I&#39;m going to share
with you about that is something that
I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re going to want to
hear but I think you need to know you
want to know I don&#39;t know I mean often
what I find with people they say they
want to hear the truth and I said try to
like that movie a few good men with Jack
Nicholson you can handle the truth you
only get SOGs
I think we have to handle the truth I
think it&#39;s time for us to go into the
detail of exactly what is happening in
the intelligence community that is
outside the control of the President and
of many of the senior officers these are
operations that are not they are
unacknowledged and they are not under
legal supervision and control
and they are a government as Senator
anyway said of their own making they
have their own airforce they have their
own space force they have their own
maybe they have their own funding
mechanism I&#39;m paraphrasing from Senator
anyway talking about this deep covert
program how are we going to address this
I think we have to address it by
bringing out as much information as we
can and being sure that the public is
aware of what the truth is about the
fact that we&#39;re not alone in the
universe but also what is the fakery and
what is being done to manipulate it now
because I&#39;ve done two things to beta
test my theory about the national
security state and the media one was the
2001 national press club event not all
of you know this story that was done as
sorry about that that was done as a
launch of something we had started in
1993 when I was asked to brief President
Clinton CIA director by some folks and
contrary to what sort of the the the the
buffoonery in the UFO subculture the
so-called Rockefeller initiative had
nothing to do with Rockefeller it was
called project starlight which I founded
with some people to end the secrecy
which Laurance Rockefeller the
philosopher of the family wanted to see
happen the David Rockefeller did not
Chase Manhattan Bank in the JPMorgan
Chase I have shared very little that of
the that the inner workings of what
happened in all the betrayals had
happened to Lawrence and to me during
that period but let&#39;s just say that the
letter that was sent to me inviting me
to brief the CIA director where it said
the most powerful people in the world
we&#39;ll have a compelling interest to do
everything to intercept this effort was
very prescient and very accurate and
that is what happened in 1999 before we
did the 2001 National Press Club I wrote
a paper called when disclosure serves
secrecy it&#39;s on our website serious
disclosure com read it and memorize it
because I wrote it because I knew it was
happening already
the wisnicki wasn&#39;t a theoretical
discussion that the effort at disclosure
would be hijacked by elements who had
then spin it in the direction of a
threat or an eschatological crisis an
end of the world sort of thing
apocalyptic which is what we&#39;ll talk
about after the break and that&#39;s what
has been green-lighted and approved as
of about 30 days ago so true now when we
did the 2001 press conference it was
covered globally briefly and then all
the media in the world ordered take it
down the grandson of James Jesus
angleton the third the man whose
signatures on the document about Marilyn
Monroe just before she died that&#39;s in
the book unacknowledged called me up and
said you know you&#39;ve moved up our
timeline 12 years of what we were
planning to do this was 17 years ago and
I said yes I&#39;m aware of that we&#39;re
disrupting some very big plans that were
hatched in the 40s and 50s and if we
don&#39;t direct the outcome it will be an
extinction-level situation for Humanity
so in this is a very serious discussion
now
now everything I&#39;m going to share with
you I&#39;ve known since 1993-94 it&#39;s hard
you you have to understand the forces
that want that are insane and I&#39;ve had
people you know I&#39;m an emergency doctor
and I have people say how could these
people want to do these things why would
they keep it secret don&#39;t they know the
earth needs these technologies I go sure
but this is like asking Eichmann and
Adolf Hitler why did they shove six
million Jews and all the gay people in
the ovens this is not a rational thing
this is not it is not something you can
relate to out of your living room or you
know Adam you know but you know we&#39;re
looking at late-night TV and then kind
of relate to the psychology of
sociopaths and Psychopaths it&#39;s it&#39;s
just not there and I&#39;ve dealt with
Psychopaths and sociopaths as a trauma
guy on the front lines of emergency and
I have dealt with ones who are in the
intelligence community and in the
military
unfortunately the ruthless sociopaths
and Psychopaths have taken over the
operational control of these
unacknowledged special access projects
that this movie unacknowledged was based
on and there are many good men who&#39;ve
been in those projects they have no idea
what the agenda of those above their pay
grade might be
I had one such man contact me a couple
months ago when I was recovering from
this shoulder surgery I fell mountain
climbing and have five big 1 inch screws
in my shoulder so I&#39;m it&#39;s a little
uncomfortable but I never stopped my
wife says you&#39;re a machine anyway but
Jacques injury number 60 I&#39;ve hit but
the point is this guy sends an email in
and we contact him and he says oh yeah
you&#39;re quite right about what happened
to Bill Colby back in 90 mid-90s when he
was going to get one of these zero point
technologies to us and some seed money
about fifty million dollars to get it
out to the public but what you don&#39;t
realize is that I know the man who
authorized that assassination and of
course he told me
and it&#39;s somebody a name you would all
know I&#39;m not gonna mention it here but I
said yes I know that those were folks
who did not want one of their own at
that level defecting and so they were
taken out which is why I do things and
this sort of strange a mysterious way I
do them now it was not wisely set up and
it was set up against my best advice to
this CIA director Colby he wanted to do
it
clandestinely like a spy would I said no
no you do it in front of the entire
world the whole world watching in real
time you wouldn&#39;t do it I have a former
president that I&#39;m hoping to get a
admission about all this from fairly
soon there&#39;s a lot happening but what I
am afraid of is that the more we step
forward the more this group is going to
try to accelerate the false flag and I
think it&#39;s time for you guys to
understand
leave the buffoonery of us ology behind
you almost everything you know and have
studied has been pre-positioned weapon
of mass dissing formation destruction of
your consciousness there is a need to do
a very deep drill down on what is the
agenda that&#39;s actually operating at this
point right now because the factions
that want to do a quasi or official
disclosure are competing with each other
and racing to do it one involves
elements in the public with the rat-pack
to the Stars Academy the other you
wouldn&#39;t know about one is a National
Security Agency official and the other
CIA and it involves some extraordinary
technology and I&#39;m going to go through
this in the second half of this
workshop because you need to understand
what our human capabilities are and it
might explain this is why these are my
closing remarks
it doesn&#39;t seem related to the Atacama
perhaps what this atacama being is
you&#39;ve all been taught that matter and
energy is primary in reality the field
of consciousness and thought and these
other dimensions are primary and
manifest this dimension doesn&#39;t make
sense to people you have to turn
everything around that you&#39;ve been
taught completely invert it and in order
to understand that your physical body
even is actually supported by what the
Mystics used to call the astral body in
the body of light and the conscious
field and all of this but so is this
podium and so is this planet and so is
space and time now this is beautiful
knowledge and it&#39;s ancient knowledge the
Vedas knew it the Native Americans knew
it every ancient tradition knows this
and at the core of almost every
spiritual tradition there is some of
this information that&#39;s it may be a
residual amount but it&#39;s there now the
science behind this has developed
rapidly over the last sixty years and it
can be used like any technology for good
but it can also be used as a weapon and
the weaponization
for example of interdimensional portals
it&#39;s not theoretical it has already
happened and this is a serious problem
so we&#39;re now looking at something like
this Atacama humanoid which again no
idea what it is
it would point certainly to not be
inhuman but could it be something of a
civilization that came here a hundred
thousand years ago and has been coming
to and fro for a long time and has been
on this planet for quite some time or
even before Homo sapiens yes could be
could be that could it be that it&#39;s
emerging from another dimension into
this dimension traversing the vastness
of space and time and then manifests the
body you saw out of elements of the
earth using a template in the resonant
field of consciousness thought so called
astral field into this dimension yes
because we can do that in laboratories
at the Lockheed Martin skunk works and
have done so could it be an
unprecedented the earth but that had
evolved ahead of us and gone
interstellar and still has a home here
it could be we don&#39;t know it&#39;s okay to
say we don&#39;t know it&#39;s not not not okay
to defraud the public fake the data get
the world media behind it and submarine
the truth the scientific truth that is
not okay and that&#39;s what we need your
help because the reason this whole
atacama scandal and the reason it&#39;s also
very radioactive the scientists who&#39;ve
looked into it is that if they have done
what I&#39;ve been told by these senior
scientists they&#39;ve done this would rise
to one of the biggest cases of academic
and intelligence community and media
collusion and fraud in US history period
which as I mentioned at the beginning in
and of itself to add a comma being is
not that important there&#39;s so much other
evidence
but as a case study that we could then
use to peel back how these guys are
operating it could be dispositive it
could be proof and that&#39;s why I&#39;m making
a call now today at 3:30 Pacific time
through this webinar for an
investigative team and a team of
scientists and also attorneys to come
forward to pursue this aggressively and
very quickly now the letter that I have
that will be going to Stanford and UCSF
and Cold Spring Harbor genome research
they&#39;ll go out next week we will then be
on our website along with the
attachments which are the full comments
from these peer-reviewed your scientists
you&#39;re welcome to read them if you&#39;re
son how many people are MDS or PhDs here
I&#39;m just curious so there are a few of
you but it is very jargon Laden and
esoteric but you know if you can get
through it
or know someone who can get through it
with you I recommend it I am NOT going
to take the time as I said at the
beginning to do that because I&#39;m trying
to give you more knowledge and
information about what actually happened
and what the big picture is and the big
picture is that in 2001 disclosure
project was launched with ten times a
hundred times the evidence and material
of what was on CNN in December from this
group that wants to position everything
as a threat the to the Stars Academy
group and had all this information and
it it rose into the media and was
immediately shut down I don&#39;t know if
you are aware that the first hour of the
transmission out of the National Press
Club in Washington was electronically
jammed so that no signals could leave
that facility the night before I had
security people who saw special
operations people on the roof of that
building and doing some things so we
anticipated that would happen but it
eventually did go online but it became
so out of control that the contractor
for the National Press Club that hosted
it
the internet said it was the most wash
event in the history of the internet at
that time and it actually got the
attention of Bill Gates and Larry
Ellison all kinds of people because to
bandwidth they had to use up every back
then old-fashioned t1 line they could
access because there was too many people
wanting to see it that&#39;s when we knew
and that&#39;s when everything got jammed
and shut down
same thing with unacknowledged netflix
has featured it as one of the top picks
of the year 120 million subscribers
iTunes has featured it the orchard thank
you is a division of Sony and they have
done a great job getting it out when we
did this without a Hollywood advertising
budget and it was crowd funded by all of
you thank you
the next thing we do has to be 10 times
bigger and faster and that&#39;s what we&#39;re
making a call a second call for
production teams and personnel to create
two feature films in the next 12 months
one on the real story behind disclosure
and beyond what I&#39;m calling beyond the
alien mask
there&#39;s the mask of what you think is
alien take the mask off there&#39;s the
fricking Wizard of Oz pulling the levers
fooling everybody we got to do that it
will be highly controversial and as much
as I&#39;m hated in the UFO circles I&#39;ll be
ten times hated more I don&#39;t care I&#39;m
not running for mayor of crazytown
I only I&#39;m only interested in the truth
thank you but really honestly but at the
same time we have to do close encounters
of the fifth kind why because if 1% of
the world population sees that movie
like they have unacknowledged tens of
millions of people and begin to become
coherent in the field of consciousness
we can shift the entire trajectory of
this civilization onto a path of
enlightenment onto the path of
sustainability on to the path of world
peace
and universal peace that&#39;s our destiny
that&#39;s where humanity should be already
should have been there 50 to 100 years
ago
if Nikola Tesla had his way right here
we are in 2018 a hundred years after
World War one ended almost 75 years
after World War two ended and we still
have the warmongers in the sociopaths
and the crazies running amuck in the
planet so we the people we the people
have to stand up and do this
will the president help us I don&#39;t know
I provided a extensive brief that was
handed to him put in his hands when he
was nominated like I have for every
president will Vladimir Putin step up to
the plate I have people in the Kremlin
who are very close to him who are asking
me for information we&#39;re providing it
will the Chinese president will Teresa
may in England I don&#39;t know we can hope
we can pray but we can&#39;t wait we the
people have to do this we the people
have to do disclosure create
interplanetary contact and create a mass
movement that shifts the entire global
trajectory onto the right path I know we
can do that because it doesn&#39;t take that
many people to affect massive change and
seen in unseen ways we just have to
organize ourselves to do it and that&#39;s
why I left my medical career to do it no
one is going to do it for you you&#39;re
gonna do it for yourselves and your
children and your grandchildren and I
hope for the twenty thousands or so
generations yet unborn because the era
that we have entered into is an era that
is about a five hundred thousand year
big cycle of development in human
Ellucian and there&#39;s an old cycle by
half a million years four hundred fifty
thousand years closing so this cycle
that so we&#39;re in the throes of that
transition between an old cycle and a
new and some people say was the end of
the world I says the end of the world as
we know it not the end of the world
literally people have misinterpreted all
the Scriptures and it&#39;s the beginning of
a new civilization and that&#39;s where we
are but people who have interests in the
old order whether it be petroleum war
controlling the masses certain belief
systems in religious orders they don&#39;t
want to see this change and there are
many people who have much to lose
worth a change this large you know some
years ago when I was dealing with Neil
Armstrong a good friend of Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin about what
happened when we landed on the moon we
weren&#39;t alone when we landed as you know
but Along Came this guy and I was
looking into with Mark Carl Otto at
Goddard Space Flight Center these
strange structures on Mars and also Buzz
Aldrin pointed out on the moon Phobos
and this man came up to me and in
identified himself as a science senior
scientist at Jet Propulsion labs and I
said he said you know we can&#39;t let that
information out I said what do you mean
why not it&#39;s old these are old
structures there&#39;s some operational
facilities underneath the surface of
Mars I was told by the head of army
intelligence but these old structures
would just show evidence of
civilizations that maybe millions or
tens of millions of years ago or longer
he says no you don&#39;t understand if those
were confirmed as real it would collapse
the Orthodox and fundamentalist belief
systems of every underlined writ large
religion on earth and I said well so I
said science and religion can
agree it just can&#39;t agree with
superstitious claptrap and he said no
you don&#39;t understand the power of those
groups I thought the man lost his mind
that I have since found out that that is
a very significant part of the secrecy
here and one of the people who&#39;s
recently contacted me is part of that
cell that our eschatology which is the
study of how the world will end and as
Prince hans-adam von Lichtenstein told
me in a private meeting in July of 1994
at the Four Seasons in New York City he
said you know the reason I&#39;m funding all
the abduction groups in the United
States is that we really want people to
hate the aliens so that they will
support an interplanetary war that would
lead to Armageddon so that Jesus Christ
will return I say excuse me this is the
crown prince of liechtenstein the
banking family funded Adolf Hitler blah
blah blah I go it excuse me what are you
talking about and he began to explain to
me how that was essential that there be
enough people willing to sacrifice blood
and treasure and in their belief to
engage in an interplanetary conflict so
that the Messiah would return for the
Jews Christ would return for the
Christians the 12th Imam would return to
the Muslims the maître Buddha would
return to the Buddhist etc and so on I
said well this is the craziest damn
thing I&#39;ve ever heard but they want to
set that up and that&#39;s what they&#39;re
doing now if I had heard this from
someone who was low on their lithium
level or Haldol in the ER but this is a
man of immense power and wealth
hobnobbing with the elite of the world
and who was on this committee that was
in 1994 okay this is 24 years on
what I&#39;m trying to explain to you is
that this is a huge story much bigger
than what we can portray and
unacknowledged or have that&#39;s what
training wheels on the next movie let&#39;s
take the training wheels off okay you
want to who wants to do it let&#39;s do it
it&#39;s going to go from et 101 and 102 and
maybe 201 since we&#39;re at a university to
the postdoc level because we don&#39;t have
time to sort of go through all the
iterations now what it also means is
that because I have proven through very
well-organized strategies from the mid
90s to now that the mainstream media is
going to block what we&#39;re doing they are
only going to feature people and
messages that comport with what the
intelligence community wants that I have
proven that over and over again and if
nothing proves it is the success of
unacknowledged and it being blacklisted
from you wouldn&#39;t believe the things
that have happened for it to be taken
data out of media reports and out of
algorithms on Google search and
everything and it&#39;s still the number one
in the world for the last year why
because people are ready for the damn
truth and we got to give it to them so
that&#39;s what we are going to do but I
need your help in addition to this and
this is gets into the Bazaar now my life
if you spent two weeks at my house in
any two week segment yeah you&#39;d be
hurling yourself off of the highest will
have worse injury than this but I have
been asked in the last couple of months
by a person with very close ties to the
Kremlin and someone was very close ties
to the national security system and the
president to write an announcement
speech for them I will read it to you
today
it&#39;s a draft I did it at 5:00 a.m. this
morning
er Doc&#39;s just pushed through you know we
just go go go go it&#39;s like military ops
go go go go but it&#39;s interesting because
I was asked to do it these people don&#39;t
know each other and they both separately
have come forward I&#39;m going why are you
asking about this now they said because
they understand that this has been
authorized and there&#39;s going to be the
disclosure that could be a horrific
event for the planet or there could be a
disclosure that would bring in a new
enlightened era for the planet this is
the biggest choice that not just our
lifetimes but it&#39;s a millennial event
and we have to get it right we have to
get it right so tonight at about about
an hour and a half I will share with you
this draft and all of you will pretend
you are a head of state from different
countries so here we have Theresa May do
we have anyone from China or the so we
have the president of China we have
someone from Africa with somebody from
you know Russia alehrer is here she&#39;s
originally Russian she&#39;ll be Belle
addameer Putin who if you want to be
Trump I don&#39;t know
I need the orange the whole orange thing
going but I&#39;m just kidding
inappropriate you can see why be all the
worst politician on earth anyway so but
that&#39;s what I want all of you to
visualize what would you do if you were
asked to make this announcement and how
would you couch it how do you frame it
and what do you do to get ahead of
what&#39;s being planned by those who would
see a sink into the worst catastrophe
and recorded human history so that&#39;s our
choice it&#39;s the choice we have to make
now don&#39;t get me wrong you know I
remember when Tom Bearden said this to
me the fools may blow it yet is from
Louisiana I Presiden there&#39;s Plan B the
Phoenix
we&#39;re in Phoenix and the Phoenix plan is
that they still blow the system but
there&#39;s a critical mass of people to
carry us forward afterwards with the
correct consciousness knowledge and
frankly technologies to do so the
outcome will be wonderful either way in
the long run in the short run we won&#39;t
I&#39;m an emergency doctor it&#39;s all about
ameliorating suffering and saving lives
there are a lot of lives at stake here
there&#39;s about 5 billion of the seven and
a half billion lives hanging in the
balance so
as someone yeah they&#39;re only oh um and
that&#39;s true
that&#39;s a accurate number so what we have
to do is figure out do we want to divert
and you know pull our civilization to
something that really will be amazing
because imagine this you know we
overcome this Heine nonsense and we end
up with a civilization that has free
energy no surface roads electromagnetic
gravity devices you use peacefully not
for missile delivery systems we have the
ability to go to the Stars and back in
peace there is no poverty on the planet
and no injustice within one generation
all people have their birthright of
living and dignity and abundance that
technology exists today how do we get
applied and how do we get it in place
without it being weaponized and without
it creating something worse than what we
have already this is why the crisis is
in consciousness is a deep spiritual
crisis and by the way that is going to
be the solution but it&#39;s going to have
to have the practical means to do it so
we need wise people on the planet to
join in this effort and that&#39;s all of
you in this room and all of you
listening and when this goes on the
internet all of you around the world
because it is there&#39;s simply no way one
person&#39;s going to do this or one
president or and in fact I will tell you
how many times I have had meetings with
Senators heads of states heads of royal
families who go this is too big of an
issue for me to deal with I don&#39;t want
to deal with it you deal with it and
kick the can down the road that&#39;s what&#39;s
been going on for seventy years we
cannot do that any longer and I
mentioned that when I first started this
project I was a young doctor and you
know I had four little kids the ages of
my grandkids now so I have seen a
generation
of this go on and I&#39;ve learned a lot and
I&#39;ve made mistakes but we gotta excuse
me we&#39;ve got to get it right this time
we we have to because at this point in
history there is no way we can pass this
on to our grandchildren we don&#39;t have
until 2050 or 2100 to fix the big
biosphere problems and geopolitical
problems and proliferation of weapons
and conflict all of that has come has to
come to a head and we have to find a
good outcome for this now we can do it I
have full faith that people working in
concert incoherence from the heart and
the mind and with a great purpose can
achieve great things let us not forget I
mean we&#39;re in the United States for
people listening from around the world
the ragtag people who were called
revolutionaries in 1776 were unfunded
had very little weapons didn&#39;t even have
uniforms and we&#39;re going up against the
mightiest superpower in the world at the
time the British Empire and that Navy
and they prevailed with the help from
France and some other people we have to
realize that this is a similar situation
except it doesn&#39;t have to be a violent
revolution it has to be a revolution in
thought action disclosure
organization and putting forward the
best of humanity to not only each other
but to these extraterrestrial
civilizations that&#39;s what they&#39;re
waiting for in the next two hours after
a break that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to focus
on is what have can we do you and me all
of us together to make contact with
these civilizations as ambassadors to
them and to create a liaison between
human civilization and these other
civilizations not waiting for the UN or
the president to do it now we hope they
do
but and you know hey a broken watch is
correct twice a day might happen but it
I wouldn&#39;t bet the future of humanity on
it I would bet the future of humanity on
those of you in this room and list those
listening because most of the people of
Earth are good people
most of the people on earth want a good
future if they have the tools the
knowledge the information and the tools
to do it and that&#39;s what we have to give
them so that&#39;s what we will cover in the
next segment thank you very much we&#39;ll
take about a 15 minute break
