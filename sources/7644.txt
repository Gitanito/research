I had taken sleeping pills in my home. I became unconscious. Someone found me and took me to the emergency room. I don't know at what point in time this experience occurred while I was in the hospital seeing that I was unconscious for a week and wasn't exactly looking at a calendar. At some point during this time I remember (this is the only thing I remember clearly) floating in my hospital room looking down from above at my body in the hospital bed. It's as if I was lying on top of my unconscious body - head to head, toe to toe, just not touching it and floating in the air. I didn't know if my body was dead or unconscious. There was nobody else in the room and I clearly remember saying, 'Wow. I'm really dead,' but no real words would come out, it was just thoughts. I seriously thought it was all over. You can imagine how surprised I was to wake up still in the hospital bed with people all around me. I'd like to talk to someone else who has had a similar experience. This is remarkable to me. No one here believes me though.
