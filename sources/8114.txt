  		              		Experience Description   

    I had a near-death experience when I was around the age of 11. I was in back of the school skating on roller blades. I hit a rock that caused me to lose my balance and fall.  I went unconscious.    

  Suddenly, I was in the dark.  I was floating and feeling very calm with such an unearthly feeling. I felt a sense of calmness and comfort. Then I had a very quick life review from birth up to the time of that moment. It seemed like my whole life was reviewed in a second. Then I felt the calmness again while I was in that dark and still floating. I was not afraid although I couldn't see anything. Then I heard voice calling out my name from a long distance away. I remember that I wasn't happy at the person who was calling my name because I didn't want to leave that dark place or disturb my calmness there. 

But the voice kept getting louder and louder. I became more agitated and disturbed. I woke up with a sharp pain in my left hand. I realized that the voice was my friend who was playing with me at that time. I always wondered that If she didn't call my name if I would have enjoyed being in that darkness and if I would have gone forever into it. 

I always remember this experience in detail as if it was yesterday. I felt it was a heavenly experience and now I think of this as an 'in-the-waiting-room' experience between earth and the unearthly.

  This story seemed finished at that time. But I started writing poems about love until I had more strange experiences. On June 11, 2016, I attended a funeral of someone I was not very closely related to. I attended to express my condolence and respect to the family. I left their home after some hours and was walking back to my car. I kept hearing a voice in my head saying something like a poem. I felt like I had to write the words down as soon as possible, otherwise I wouldn't be able to think about or do anything else. I wrote them down quickly after I reached the car.  Then I forgot about it for some time. A year later, I was sitting next to the daughter of a deceased person and asked her if she wanted to hear what I wrote on that day. When she said she wanted to hear the poem, I read it to her. She was sobbing and saying, 'This is my dad! It's him! It's him!' I didn't know what to say, but I felt sense of relief because I finally conveyed the message of her father to his daughter. 

  On February 28, 2020, I woke up very tired and was sobbing, yet I had no idea why. Normally, I fix breakfast and drink my coffee. But that morning, I rushed to my computer and start typing.  I heard a voice telling me many things.  Then, I started to recall what I had seen in my dream.  Yet, I didn't realize what I was writing at that moment as I was sobbing and feeling very sad. After getting my coffee and finishing writing, I shut down my computer and forgot about it. Later that day, I read the poem-like message. I again remembered that dream and saw my grandfather who was sitting and smoking.  I also saw my grandmother who was sobbing.  My grandmother passed away in the year I was born. Then I saw one of my uncles sitting in front of them with sad look on his face. By the way, I saw my grandmother first time in person even it was in dream. I remember them sitting inside the Mongolian yurt and I was seeing them between a blue curtain. In the poem-like-message it said, 'There is no time left, summer is approaching...will take our son to where he belongs...' Then exactly, 5 months later (which is today) my uncle passed away in the hospital. Today is 28th of July according to Mongolian time and it is  summer.

What is your religion now?         Moderate     

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     My belief system changed and I believe our ancestors are always watching us and with us all the time.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Yes     My belief system of presence of my ancestors with us all the time has become more confirmed.

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     I used to hear old man voice from my early young age, like 5 years old.  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Being able to feel it before things happen. But worst thing is when I predict something bad is going to happen like death of somebody, is really happen.  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I don't know how they felt about it. we lost our uncle just few hours ago. I don't know how they are going to react.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I think you can expand multiple choice answers with more explanation empty box.
