THE LOVE OF RABIACCA
PREFACE
Having read of the wonderful
psychic power of concentrated
thought, a small company of friends
decided to experiment with it. Mrs.
C., being the most sensitive mem-
ber of the party, was selected as
the subject of the experiment.
With the light turned low Mrs. C;
lay down upon a couch, while the
others formed a circle around her
and crooned a soft melody. Soon
a slight spasmodic twitching of Mrs.
C. showed that she had contacted
super-physical forces. Her hand
was gradually raised and remained
fixed. The authors, in trying to re-
place the arm, discovered to their
111
iv Preface
amazement that her whole body had
become rigid and that she was
pointing in horror to a sight pre-.
sented to her inner vision. Soon
she began to talk, and calling each
of the party by strange names, she
described and seemed actually to ex-
perience and to live the events re-
lated. From notes taken at the time,
the authors have arranged the fol-
lowing short narrative of the events
as they were described, and those
present at the time have since
vouched for their accuracy. Mrs.
C. is not a subjective medium nor
a spiritualist, and at no time did
she pass into a state of trance, but
retained her consciousness through-
out the experience.

THE BATTLEMENTS
AT last thou art come, my
lord, Zauzibaris 1 When yon-
der moon had stretched its shadows
across the court below, and thou
wert not here, I feared that my lord
had forgotten his promise to give
me this last hour's speech with him
alone."
"And how should a soldier not
keep his word with Princess Mal-
dingo?" replied the warrior.
Princess Maldingo was of the
royal house of Quetzacoatl, and the
King's brother, Prince Zanzibaris,
had but just returned from his tn-.

umphal campaigns against the tribes
of the farther provinces to attend
the burial ceremonies of his brother,
the dead King. They stood on a
small battlement of the palace over-
looking the city. To their left and
behind them rose the near-by moun-
tains, whose snow-capped peaks lay
enveloped in rolling masses of
blackened clouds. To their right lay
Lake Tulare with its famous Chi-
nampas or floating islands on which
were grown the luscious fruits
and vegetables for the King's table,
and the flowers for the ceremonial
decoration of the temples. Beyond
the lake stretched out the fertile
valley of Tolotlan with its irrigating
ditches marking off the silvery lines
of the cultivated' fields into little
patches of green and gold. At their
The Love of .Rabiacca
feet lay the city of Iztamal shun
bering and silent, save for the pac-.
ing of the soli sentinels on its
'flassi've walls, and the occasional
late arrival of delegatio from the
subjeet cities coming to be present
at the ICing's obsequi
The slowly Creeping Clouds had
already half veiled the light which
the full moon shed in tropical splen...
dor o'er the many stately palaces
and the majestic Temple of the Sun
which made the city famoi
througho the then known world.
"I have but just come from as-
signing our barbarian chiefta5 to
their camping places without the
city wall" said Zanzibarjs
"I had thought perhaps a more
tender duty had made thee tardy to
this tryst," replied the Princess
4 The Love of Rabiacca
"Thou speakest, I know, of Rabi-
acca, and indeed I am but a short
time come from her."
"'Twas not to speak of our
Queen's waiting woman but of the
Queen herself that I asked thee
here this hour."
"What more hast thou learned of
her ?"
"The priests and wise men and
the Council of the Twenty Lords
have met in final conclave this day,
and on the morrow will decree that,
despite the laws of our founder-
ldng, Iztaxnna, and despite the an-
dent custom of our race, the White
Queen shall not ascend the Flaming
Pyre, and in that holy flame meet
the glorious fate of going with her
lord and serving.him in the strange
lands of the gods."
"Most wisely have they spoken,
The Love of Rabiacca 5
for as thou knowest well, our
Queen, Tishana, is far more than
mortal, and were she to leave us
now, how then could our priests
speak with the gods and how could
the gods impart their instructions
to our men of learning ?"
"Twas ever thus with warriors
to believe the guidance of the gods
achieved the victories their own
prowess won. Thou hast been ab-
sent, yes these fifteen years, save to
attend the seven-year festivals, and
thou knowest her but little, and
doth believe all the strange tales
that are told concerning her. I
who, as a foster sister, have lived
with her here within these palace
walls, do know her life full well.
Ever since the day, when but a girl,
she was found wandering on our
mountain side and was brought
6 The Love of Rabiacca
thence to our 'loved King, I have
studied her, and I do know she is
but mortal as are ourselves."
"But did she not come from the
Land-Beyond-the-Mountains where
no mortal has ever trod; where wise
men say dwell all the gods? And
was ever one, among the dark-
skinned races of our world, like
unto her ?"
"Too well I know how the sight
of her white skin and yellow hair,
with her great blue eyes and
strange-sounding voice, did charm
and cause to turn me from our de-
parted King. But I tell thee that
'twas by magic she did do these
things !"
"How may that be when she com-
munes with the very highest gods
upon the sacred mountain and
The Love of Rabiacca 7
brings their inspiration to our
priests and men of learning?"
"Can it be that thou, a warrior
and a leader of our race, can yet
be blinded by such things? And
because at sight of her thy elder
brother, for full five days, could eat
no meat nor be amused by dancing
girls nor music of the reeds, for
love of her, wilt thou too, then, give
up the kingdom that, by right,
should fall to thee, and permit her
to live and reign here still as Queen?
Wilt thou leave thy brother corn-
panionless and alone in the lands
of the gods? And all in violation
of the sacred Ceremony of the
Flaming Pyre ?"
"Yet, if she should join the King,
my brother, according to the cus-
tom, how then could the gods teach
8 The Love of Rabiacca
us the wisdom that, since her com-
ing, hath raised our people to be
rulers of the world, and brought
success to every venture of our
arms and to every art and knowl-
edge our men of learning have yet
put forth ?"
"Thinkest thou that the gods will
still send their blessing on a thing
usurped or on the usurper? And
am not I, Princess Maldingo, famed
as a mighty sorceress ?"
"But well 'tis known that the
powers evoked by thee art called
unholy, and were only turned to
useful ends by the divine gift of
our White Priestess-Queen."
"Even so 'tis said by them that
envy my power. But thinkest thou
not that with thee on thy rightful
throne and with me at thy side as
Priestess-Queen, the gods would
The Love of Rabiacca 9
withhold from me aught that they
have given her? 'Tis our race they
love, not this fair-skinned foreigner
who comes whence no one knows !"
"But, though thou shouldst per-
suade me that the throne is mine
by right, and that it is our race the
gods descend to help, how could
thou then be made my Queen, when
Rabiacca is my other self, destined
by all the stars to be with me one
soul?"
"So was she thy other self, and
might have been thy soul, had not
she herself dissolved the bond by
loving in thy stead her foster
brother, Mungo, who even now
commands the palace guards."
"Thy words recall what I have
noticed oft since my return, that
she seemed not happy in my pres
ence as of yore, as though oppressed
10 The Love of Rabiacca
some dread foreboding that even
put its spell on me. This very night
she seemed distraught and f ever-
ish, as if some tragic ill impended."
"I am glad to see that thou art
not so blind as still to cling to the
love of a waiting woman, when at
thy feet a Princess of the royal
blood, aflame with love of thee,
pours out her heart and humiliates
herself to show it thus. And all
that thou mayest be our King as by
all the laws and sacred rites thou
shouldst be."
"Still, tell me how may it be
when long ago Rabiacca was be-
frothed to me in the temple when
we were yet but children. And ere
I went to war I bore upon my
breast the raw imprint of those
dear wounds from which did flow
my blood to mingle in the golden
The Love of Rabiacca 11
bowl with hers, and make us one
in blood and soul ?"
"Have I not told thee that her
unfaithfulness bath snapped the
bond and let the twin flame of thy
spirit shine in me? Thinkest thou
that Princess Maldingo could not
love thee then as much as the
waiting woman? Are not my arms
thus clasped about thy neck as soft
as ever hers? Cannot the hot-
pressed kisses of these royal lips
blot out the memory of her timid
touch? But see the size and wealth
of this dark hair of mine that
reaches o'er thy knees so straight
and long, and by it judge the
warmth my love will bring."
"The saying is that woman's
hair, when coarse and long, is but
the sign of passion's strength, and
not the pure cold flame of that true
12 The Love of Rabiacca
love which Venus gives to those
whom she selects as mates."
"Ah, my dear lord! Cannot the
soft warmth of my woman's breast,
close pressed against thy heart, melt
that cold and priestly prejudice with
which thou withholdest me thy
love? Nor cause response of one
returning throb? Shall not the
veçy excess of the passion that thou
speakest of, made pure and quick-
ened by that ray which comes to me
down from my planet, the mighty
Mars, great ruler of my destiny,
cause me to pour out on thee such
flood of ecstasy as shall bring to
me the answering thrill of love re-
turned?"
"Release thine arms I The per-
fume of thy breath doth make me
faint."
"Turn not from me, love, my
The Love of Rabiacca 13
lord. I feel the warmth of thy
awakened blood flood all thy face
and in thy hands burn hot. Ah,
thou cold of heart! But let these
aching lips seek thine again, so shalt
thou know what wealth of love my
royal blood can give."
"I cold of heart? Callest thou
me cold of heart? More like I
am an all-consuming fire. My
blood doth course through all my
flesh like molten brass white hot
and fervent unto death. I cold of
heart? When first thy hand
reached out to lie in mine upon the
parapet, my very bones began to
thrill with that wondrous spell thy
witchery bath wove. And I forgot
all else save the soft roundness of
thy woman's form and the piercing
blackness of thy fathomless eyes.
Quench once more my inward fire
14 The Love of Robiacca
in the delirium of thy lips, that I
may forget all else but that I love
thee, and that to love thee is all
bliss."
"An thou lovest me, then wilt
thou sware to be my king, and take
thy rightful place upon the throne
and see the sacred customs of our
race fulfilled?"
"So do I sware I Only let me
have again thy lips I Ahi
But how may I accomplish thy de-
sire? One may not slay the Queen
and brave the populace who hold
her sacred?"
"That can the power of my magic
spells accomplish well, my lord.
Nor shalt thou, my love, have
aught to do but hold thy sword
straight pointed toward her breast,
and by the spells that I do chant,
The Love of Rabiacca 15
thy blade shalt gain a magic power
to strike her through the heart."
"It shall be done. 'Tis all for
thee! I am thy slave !"
"Come quickly then. Let our
love wait. 'Twill but the stronger
grow. For even now she kneels be-.
fore the Flame deep in the secret
crypt beneath the Sun God's shrine,
praying for a maiden who bath
sought her aid. Be quick, my lord.
Already it is nearing dawn, and
the gathering storm seems about to
break upon our heads."
Act II
THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
P11HE last lingering note of the
sunset bell was dying on the
evening breeze. Near a shrine
upon the sacred Mountain-of-the-
Gods stood the Priestess-Quee;
Tishana. Her face was turned
toward the setting sun, her arms
outstretched, and there was a look
of far-off glory in the depths of
her great blue eyes. Over her
white robe, her yellow hair, illu-
mined by the tints of red and gold,
flashed from the sinking sun, en-
veloped her like a fleecy cloud of
shimmering light. Seen at such a
moment, well might the people
16
The Love of Rabiacca 17
think she had descended from the
sun to teach her chosen people how
to rule the world, as indeed the
priests had said.
As the last lingering beams of
light disappeared behind the moun-
tain peaks, the Priestess' lips mur-
mured a farewell prayer to the
departing god of day. Dropping
her arms, a faint sigh caught her
ear, and turning, she beheld her
favorite waiting woman and com-
panion, Rabiacca, kneeling at her
feet.
"What is it, Rabiacca, my 'loved
sister," she said with a smile of
welcome, "that makes thee venture
on the sacred mountain past the
Stone-of-the-Sun that marks the
usual boundaries of approach?
Hast thou climbed all this steep
18 The Love of Rabiacca
path to say farewell with me to
glorious Tonathiu ?" *
"Nay, nay, my Queen; I come
to speak to thee as to a mother
whose love divineth all her child's
heart hath need to say."
"Speak, sweet sister mine. For
thou dost know my love for thee
wilt grant thee all the comfort it
can give."
"I am so oppressed and sad I
could not live within myself another
hour, and so I come to thee to bare
my heart."
"Sit down upon this mound and
pillow here thy head upon my knee
so. Now tell me what it is that
troubleth thee."
"Tis fear for my dear lord,
Prince Zanzibaris, that weighs upon
God of the Sun.
The Love of Rabiacca 19
my heart. Thou dost know that,
when but still a child, I was pledged
to him at some mysterious altar
whose form I yet recall deep be-
neath the temple floor. And when
he had reached the age for war,
and had buckled on his maiden
sword to go abroad and win his
right to be called a man, he, of
his own free will, did renew in his
heart's warm blood his troth to me.
And on my body do I bear a pre-
dons scar where the stream of our
two bleeding hearts did mingle
and yet methinks he loves me not.
The scar upon my breast hath fes-
tered since his return as if the drops
instilled had slowly nurtured poison.
So sore it is that at those rare times
when still he clasps my heart to
his, I tremble and shrink from his
embrace. Nor dare I tell him what
20 The Love of Rabiacca
I feel. And daily in the Assembly
his glance doth ever seek the eyes
of our royal Princess, Maldingo,
and I see them burn and flash and
linger there."
At the mention of Zanzibaris'
name, the Priestess, Tishana, gazed
far out over the mountains toward
the blaze of glory left by the sunken
sun, unseeing. She seemed about
to speak, but each time her lips
parted, a spasm of emotion choked
back the words; meanwhile her
hands with caressing touch still
smoothed aside the raven strands
from Rabiacca's brow. At last,
with an effort of control, she turned
her gaze upon the young girl's face,
and one could almost swear that
in her eyes were glistening, unshed
tears.
"Sweet sister," the Priestess re-
The Love of Rabiacca 21
plied, "thou shalt have all my help.
Full well I know that Zanzibaris
doth wish his throne. I, in his eyes,
am but a base usurper, and Mal-
dingo has impressed deep this
thought upon his ambitious soul
and pictured to his mind the great-
ness of his reign. Ye gods! How
gladly could I give it him! But at
this time he could not understand
my thought in it. Perhaps I should
ascend the Flaming Pyre of my de-
parted lordwho never was my
rightful lord, the gods declare. He
wed me when I was but a child,
and at that time the wise men did
favorably cast the circle of the stars
at his command but to save their
heads.
"But hush! Thou didst not hear
me speak those words! Turn thou
thine innocent eyes away from
22 The Love of Rabiacca
mine! I cannot bear their gaze.
They seem to search my inmost
thoughts. Since now 'tis said, I'll
tell thee that, though I was made
his Queen, I never loved my lord.
And so how can I follow then and
serve him in those other lands
where every heart is read as dearly
as the carven symbols on the pal-
ace gate?
"But I will help thee, Rabiacca.
'Tis but thy right to wed with Zan..
zibaris. And I, the Sun God's
bride, will aid thee by my power
from on high. No! no I" she half
whispers, "no thought of mortal
love shall make less clear the depths
of my aspiring soul. All the mighty
force that I do gain from yonder
sinking sun, my Lord, my God, will
I exert to foil that sorceress' plot,
and bring to thee thy happiness.
The Love of Rabiacca 23
"Stay thou up on the mountain,
child, and I will tell thee what herbs
of mystic potency to gather. And
when, at midnight, thou hast culled
all seven kinds kneel thou upon
this rock and pray until morning's
dawn doth give thee first its golden
raysthen seek me out. And while
thou prayest, deep within the
temple altar's heart will I perform
the sacred Fire Sacrifice; and all
the night will feed the holy Flame
with magic herbs, and gather from
its fiery breath the god's intent.
Promise me, 'loved sister, that thou
wilt not return 'fit morning dawns,
nor ever turn thine eyes toward the
city gates. Let no inner sense, no
augury, distract thy pure soul from
its lone midnight vigil. Pray ear-
nestly and come to me at sunrise.
And now good night; I leave thee,
24 The Love of Rabiacca
but fear thou not. Good night,
good night."
"But stay, my Queen! Thou art
so sad! Indeed I am but cruel,
selfish, thus to pour my troubles in
thine ears, and on this sad night of
all the nights! I had forgot that
thou wouldst be all distraught be..
use thy lord goeth hence upon the
Flame tomorrow and thou goest not
with him. But thou art so strong
and noble! This night, methinks,
if 'twere my lord that went alone, I
would spend in sorrow's thrall, and
tears enough I'd shed to bear his
soul unto the shores of bliss. To
leave him thus alone! Ah me!
What is my sorrow unto thine ?"
"My child, thou .dost not under-
stand. As Queen, well did I serve
my lord, the King. But now I owe
a duty to my over-lord, cven the
The Love of Rabiacca 25
great god Tonathiu, and he bids me
cherish all true love and haste it
to its fulfilling. So will I begin
with thine this night and bring to
fruit thy happiness. Farewell,
farewell I"
Sadly, taking the young girl's
face between her hands, and look-
ing tenderly into her eyes, the
Priestess pressed a lingering kiss
upon her lips, then turning, went
slowly down the mountain, leaving
Rabiacca to gather the herbs with
which to make her love philter.
Acrill
THE TEMPLE CRYPT
URN here, my lord. This is
the secret passage from the
Priestess' chamber of preparation
by which she comes to pray before
going to the public service of the
temple, and at each midnight houL
Its opening is at the side, behind
the pillar of Venus. It is close to
the altar, and is not seen from the
palace passage nor from that by'
which the priests descend. There
shalt thou, in one full stride, stand
close behind her as she kneels be-
fore the Flame. And with thy
sword straight pointed toward her
heart, shall her end come peace-
fully, and without harm to thee.
26
The Love of Rabiacca 27
But be thou careful that thou mak-
est no sound, nor cause her to turn
and break my spell"
Qosely following 7-'n7ibaris, the
Princess Maldingo stepped from
the passage into the little round
chamber that formed the crypt.
This chamber, hewn from the liv-
ing rock, was necessarily small,
not over seven paces in diameter,
with a bell-shaped dome some three
spans in height at the center. At
equal distances around the walls
stood twelve pillars of pure, white
marble, around each of which there
twined a large serpent of solid gold,
in whose eyes were set a rose-pink
gem. Around a smaller circle
within these pillars $ood seven
others, six of which were each of
different colored onyx, and one of
pure gold, studded with immense
28 The Love of Rabiacca
jewels. At the side, opposite the
golden pillar, upon a small pyramid
reached by seven steps, stood a
block of clear, translucent stone re-
sembling crystal, an arm's length in
each dimension. A thin, pale flame
rose from a bowl-shaped depression
cut in its top, and was reflected
from a symbol of the sun em-
blazoned in solid gold upon the cen-
ter of a great balanced cross of
white marble which stood close be-
hind the altar. Just above the cross,
apparently floating in the air, was
a white swan with outstretched
wings, also having jewels for its
eyes.
Not a sound broke the solemn
stillness of that subterranean cham-
ber save the murmur of the Priest-
ess' voice as she knelt on the
topmost step of the altar. From
The Love of Rabiacca 29
time to time she cast into the flame
certain mystic herbs, whose pun-
gent, aromatic odors seemed to exalt
the higher faculties of her soul to
ecstasy. With each herb she re-
peated mantraxn, and with the last,
shaking free the folds of her flow-
ing robe, she raised her arms to the
now glowing symbol of the sun, and
half prayed, half chanted the solemn
invocation of the Fire Sacrifice.
"Ascending Flame, within whose
all-encircling arms all substance
must be dissolved, all lower forces
transmuted into the all-creating
force of Love, let Thy hot breath
burn 'round my trembling soul, and
consume all earthly dross. Let Thy
purifying heat transmute into god-
like love all my mortal thoughts,
that I, Thy Priestess, may stand on
earth Thy virgin bride, unsullied
30 The Love of Rabiacca
e'en by a thought of mortal love,
as stand those souls who, after
many lives and many funeral burn-
ings, at last attain perfection.
"0 Thou great and glorious One!
to whom all men turn in time of
need! Thou wondrous embodiment
of the all-creative power that
dwelleth in our sun! Accept, we
pray, the incense of these our burnt
offerings. And as the potent force
of life, imprisoned by Thee within
these herbs, ascends to its divine
Creator, so Inayest ascend to Thine
embrace the adoration of this
humble heart and the service of
this my life.
"As the tongues of flame shrivel
up the form and transmute the sub-
stance of these herbs that their
soul-force may be set free, so may
the Divine Creative Fire of these
The Love of Rabiacca 31
two hearts, Thy children Zanzi-
bans and Rabiacca, joined by the
force of pure mortal love and
watered with the rain of perfect
sympathy and due respect, purge
from their minds the dross of
earthly passion and flow forth cre-
ative and ennobling unto a future
life.
"Accept, we beseech Thee, the
sacrifice of all earthly joy in the
person of this, Thy Priestess, and
give to them the happiness of per-
fect love on earth that through its
mystic power they may evolve to
mastery. Accept, 0 great God of
Fire, the body, the life, the soul of
this Thy Priestess, and let her life
be even as the withered herbs, that
the divine spark of their united
lives may ever fly straight up to be
at one with Thee. Send down Thy
32 The Love of Rabiacca
swift, pure ray into their souls, that
they may see Thee face to face and
worship Thee aright.
"Thus as the warmth and the
light and the force of Thy outer
breath hath made these herbs to
grow and bloom, so may Thy inner
breath perfect and bring to birth
their inner selves. Seven times, 0
Glorious One, did I cast into the
Flame the seven herbs of power.
Three times doth Thy Priestess
prostrate herself before Thine altar
that '1hou mayest accept the living
sacrifice so freely made that Love
may reign supreme."
Scarce had she finished the three
prostrations when Maldingo, f ear-
ing that this solemn scene would
unnerve the Prince for the crime
she had planned for him, coughed
harshly. And as the Priestess,
The Love of Rabiacca 33
startled, turned half toward the out-
stretched blade, Maldingo clutched
the Prince's arm and fiercely whis-
pered, "Strike !" With his senses
still enmeshed in the spell of pas-
sion, uncomprehending the Priest-
ess' words, and with Maldingo's hot
whisper in his car, scarce knowing
what he did, he thrust the sword
straight through the Priestess'
breast. With a smothered cry of
"Oh! Thou? My Lord ?" she fell
upon the upper steps, clutching at
the sculptured figures on the altar's
side. Even as the thrust was made,
a frenzied cry of "Hold! In the
name of great Teotl !" rang out
from the farther side of the cham-
ber. And in a few quick bounds
the pale and frantic priest, Balixus,
stood before them.
"Thou! Zanzibaris? Thou, my
34 The Love of Rabiacca
brother? Thou the murderer of
our Priestess-Queen? What bale-
ful mystery is this, that such a
crime can dye thy hands with
sacred blood and stain thy soul
throughout the ages hence? Who
is that with thee there, that shrink-
ing seeks to hide behind thy cloak?
Ah, thou, then, that with thy unholy
spells hast brought my brother to
this foul deed! Well know I now
the meaning of the portent that our
Queen these many days bath had,
of evil deeds impending!"
The1 priest, kneeling beside the
fallen Queen, raises her stricken
form gently in his arms and finds
the flow of blood already stopped.
Zanzibaris, pale and shaken, stands
transfixed with horror. Cold beads
of perspiration gather on his brow,
and his eyes stare wide and fas-
The Love of Rabiacca 35
cinated at the fallen Priestess' face.
What cord of mystery did that
dying look awake? What memories
of a dim and misty past swept o'er
his soul? Suddenly, with a half
stifled moan, he realizes what the
last words of the Priestess had re-
'vealed. At last he sees that he has
been but the tool of the designing
and heartless Princess Maldingo.
Mistaking his silence, Maldingo
says, "Tis well deserved, this
death, to one who would set at
naught our sacred rites, and seize
our kingdom, and usurp thy lawful
throne, my Prince."
"Silence, woman! or witch, or
whatever kind of female thing thou
art, that evil spirits use to work
their damning deeds! Freed now
thy passion's spell, too well I see
what desire of thine own advance
36 The Love of Rabiacca
hath worked in thee to plan this
awful deed of mine. And I, weak
fool, to listen to thy siren words,
and thus, in one fell act, foresware
all love and bring to death the
Priestess of our people, through
whom alone the gods gave great-
ness to our race."
The priest Balixus, rising then,
speaks. "Should any leave this
scene alive, how might we then ex-
plain our Priestess' death without
delivering thee, my brother, to slow
torture's rack? There is but one
thing left to do when in the noble
line injustice irreparable has been
wrought, and that, the 'Rite of the
Naked Sword."
"And gladly do I welcome it," the
Prince replied, "that I may follow
her, and by my sacrifice and faith-
ful service in those other lands in
The Love of Rabiacca 37
which she wanders strive, through
ages hence, to undo the wrong I
did this day, and return to her the
goddess love She bore for me.
Make us thy priestly oath, my
brother, and we will swear it fast."
The priest then took the bloody
sword that Zanzibaris had dropped
and holding it out toward his
brother, said, "Take then this sword
dipped in thy Priestess' martyred
blood, and make the sacred cross
upon the woman too. Now, swear
by the ancient 'Rite of Naked
Sword' that was ordained since first
our race lgan; and by the sacred
threefold ry of our most high god
Toique-Nahuaque, that in all thy
future lives, through all the lands
that thou shalt wander, and
whate'er thy many changing state,
thou wilt seek out our Priestess-
38 The Love of Rabiacca
Queen and serve her with thy life's
best blood, until such ages hence
have passed as shall atone to her
the wrong that thou hast this day
done."
"By the ancient 'Rite of Naked
Sword,' and by the threefold ray of
our most high god Toique-Na-
huaque, I so do swear to serve her
with my life's best blood, until the
debt is wholly paid, and I restore
to her tlie love she sacrificed for me
this night."
Maldingo sinks down upon the
cold stone floor and, covering her
face with her hands, moans dis-
tractedly.
"Swear, woman I" thundered the
Prince. "Why clingest thy ready
tongue so dry to thy fear-shrunk
lips? Swear, I say! Swear !"
Maldingo, with a terrified look,
The Love of Rabiacca 39
murmurs through her blanched lips,
"I swear."
Then they cast lots to see who
first shall plunge upon the upright
sword. The first lot falls to the
priest, Balixus. Turning to the
Prince, his brother, he says, "Fare-
well, dear brother. As I have kept
faithful watch over our loved
Queen here, so shall I ever watch
o'er her in times to come, and re-
mind thee of thy oath. Be thou
faithful unto it. Farewell I"
As he falls upon the sword, Mal-
dingo groans and shudders, for
unto her the second lot-has fallen.
Turning imploringly to the Prince
she pleads: "Ah, force me not,
good Zanzibaris, to do this awful
thing! I do not want to die!
'Twas not I that did the deed, but
thou! And though I counseled it,
40 The Love of Rabiacca
'twas but for thine own good and
prompted by my love for thee."
"Fulfill thy oath! Nor speak to
me of thy unholy love in this dread
vault of death. Thy turn! Be
quick!"
"AhI but do let me live a day
and I will pray for thee a thousand
prayers before the Sun God's
shrine."
"Clasp so the swordso. What!
Must I then hold thy coward hand
upon the hilt? Now! Whilst I
grip fast thy trembling hand, one
plunge and then I'll follow thee."
The Prince forces her to fall
upon the sword while he holds her
hand upon the hilt and steadies it.
He then places the sword against
his own breast and falls upon it,
across the bodies of the other two,
at- the foot of the altar.
AcTIV
THE LOVE PHILTER
RABIACCA, left alone up on
the mountain side, began at
once to gather the herbs indicated
by the Priestess. It was no easy
task to pick them in the exact man-
ner prescribed and to remember the
proper mantram that must be said
as each flower was plucked. And
thus for a while, she was so intent
upon her task that she took no heed
of the muttering storm that was
creeping down the mountain side.
On and on she wandejed until she
had gathered all but one herb, the
last and most potent. The Priestess
had told her that this last flower
stood for the last letter of the
41
42 The Love of Rabiacca
Sacred Word without which the
charm would be of no avail. And
since, if it were gathered in the
shadow, its portent would be dark,
Rabiacca prayed most earnestly for
just one more ray of moonlight that
the philter might be perfect. But
the rapidly descending clouds had
now completely obscured the face of
the moon. Rabiacca, not daring to
turn homeward toward the city,
stumbled on, trembling with fear
both that she would fail in her im-
portant task and of the approachinj
storm. At last her groping hand
touched an immense rock, one of
the "Stones-of-the-Sun" standing
upright in her path. Despairing
further search, and kneeling with
her outstretched arms in the form
of a cross, she prayed, "0 Mother
The Love of Rabiacca 43
Meztli,* give me light! But one
faint ray from Thy dear face that
I may find the flower that shall win
my lord. In the holy name of Love
do I implore Thee grant my
prayer."
The words were scarce uttered
when a blinding flash, accompanied
by a terrific peal of thunder, struck
the rock before which she knelt and
split it from top to bottom. In the
instant of time before unconscious-
ness came she distinctly saw the
flower she desired growing in a
crevice of the rock. Was it only a
trick of her failing senses or did
she really see? The flower seemed
to be blooming upon the top of a
burning funeral pyre. How dearly
Goddess of the Moon.
44 Thi Love of Rabiacca
she could see the flames curl and
rise around it; and yet the little
flower lifted up its head unharmed.
And just above it, as if floating in
the flame itself, she seemed to see
the forms of Zanzibaris and the
Priestess clasped in each other's
arms. Each face bore a look of
glad triumph which changed to an
expression of tender love as they
turned their eyes toward her and
reached out their arms. Rabiacca
held out her hand and tried to reach
them and the little flower, but she
could not accomplish this without
ascending the burning pyre itself.
Oh, surely, surely had her prayer
been answered! Not only Meztli
but great Izcozauhqui himself had
lighted up the heavens that she
might win her love. With one glad
cry, almost instinctively, she grasped
The Love of Rabiacca 45
the blossom and fell senseless to
the ground. Nor did she stir. Life
seemed utterly gone from her frail
and slender form. There she lay,
a cold, stark figure, while the pelt-
ing rain whirled in solid sheets
about her, and almost continuous
flashes of lightning illumined her
pale, wet face with fantastic reds
and blues and greens. Yet still she
moved not.
AcrV
SCENE 1. THE RITE OF
NAKED SWORD
J1HE sun was slowly rising over
a new and beautiful world,
washed and refreshed by the night's
storm. The little birds woke one
by one, and after preening their
brilliant plumage, swelled forth a
hymn of praise that seemed to say,
"All storms will pass and God still
lives and loves always." These
were the words that again and again
repeated themselves in a numb sort
of way in Rabiacca's mind until the
dulled brain at last seemed to catch
and understand them. "All storms
will pass and God still lives and
loves always."
Painfully she arose from the
46
The Love of Rabiacca 47
ground and noted with joy that the
mystic herbs were still clasped in
her hand, even the last little flower
from off the rock. She dried her
robe as best ske could and sat down
to collect her thoughts and remem-
ber what had happened during the
night.
How calm and peaceful the city
looked in the early morning light!
The sleepy guards upon the walls
were giving place to their relief, and
the words of command and the
clank of the chain armor floated
with startling distinctness through
the dear morning air. A few early
peasants riding on their diminutive
burros were approaching the gates,
but still the city slept on in the
rising sun like a peacefully sleeping
child smiling at its mother's last
caress.
48 The Love of Rabiacca
Rabiacca hastened to descend the
path, for she was anxious to enter,
unnoticed, the inner temple gate,
where Balixus was to await her and
conduct her to the Queen. In his
stead, however, she found her
foster brother, Mungo, who said he
had come to relieve Balixus just
before the storm broke, soon after
midnight, but he had found the post
deserted.
It had been a fearful night, he
said. All through the castle had
walked the dead. Many of the
guards told how they had heard
strange voices that were not of
earth go whispering through the
halls. Some of the priests said they
had heard a piercing shriek rise
from out the sacred crypt and die
away in rolling thunder. But of
course that was but imagined by
The Love of Rabiacca 49
their fearsome minds; for it was
known that the Priestess-Queen
herself would pass the night there
praying beside the Sacred Fire.
Yet there were those who said the
Spirits of the Flame were angry,
and resented the breaking of the
ancient custom whereby the Queen
was to escape the Flaming Pyre.
Others declared that all was I6st
and the nation's glory was at an
end, for they had distinctly seen
their white Priestess-Queen, who
had come from the Land-of-the-.
Gods, return thither through the
air, riding on a thunderbolt, ruling
and guiding it with a wand of fire.
Rabiacca pushed aside the gar-
rulous Mungo and quickly de-
scended to the crypt through the
priests' passageway. One look, and
with a cry of terror, she swooned
50 The Love of Rabiacca
upon the bottom step. The alarm
was quicldy sounded, and the pas-
sage leading to that chamber of
horror was soon crowded with
priests and guards. The floor was
blotched with pools of blood whose
sickly odor, mingled with the half
dissipated fumes of the incense,
filled the crypt with an almost suf-
focating smell. The feeble flame
still burning on the altar shed a
wan half-light upon the drawn and
pallid faces of the dead, and only
served to increase the ghastly
weirdness of that silent scene.
The position of the bodies, and
the fact that the Prince's own
sword was still protruding from his
back, indicated plainly to the as-
sembled officers that the "Rite of
Naked Sword" had been performed.
But for what reason? ILwas well
The Love of Rabiacca 51
known among the priests that since
the death of the King, Balixus had
been acting as the bodyguard of the
Priestess on account of the plotting
of those with whom Maldingo was
suspected of conspiring to place
Zanzibaris on the throne. It was
therefore dear that the Queen had
met her death through either Ma!-
dingo or Zanzibaris, and that in
some way Balixus must have forced
them to undergo the ancient Rite.
All the bodies were cold and
stark save alone that of the Priest-
ess. Her flesh was still warm, and
she showed some signs of life. Her
eyes were open, and, though un-
seeing, were lit with expression of
glad expectancy, and her face ap-
peared radiant with happiness in-
stead of being frozen with horror
as might have been expected. The
52 7'he Love of Rabiacca
rent in her robe where the sword
had pierced was tinged with blood,
evidently only by its withdrawal,
for no stream of blood had flowed.
More marvelous still, the wound
seemed already partly healed!
The bodies were removed and a
council of the priests and the
Twenty Lords was quickly called
to consider the awful tragedy.
This council had scarce begun its
grave deliberations when a commo.-
tion was heard at the entrance, and
the heavy leathern curtains were
suddenly thrust aside and Rabiacca,
pale and haggard, her damp hair
still streaming in wild disarray over
her shoulders, and her bedraggled
robe clinging to her girlish form,
thrust herself into their august
presence despite the detaining hands
Tue Love of Rabiacca 53
of the guards. Dropping upon one
knee, she raised her arms toward
the high priest Votan, who was pre-
siding, and said: "Great Father,
I beg thee hear my plea."
"What unseemly haste is this that
makest thou, a woman, burst thus
upon our solemn council unan-
nounced? Yet seeing thou art so
o'erwrought that scarce thy wits
can answer for thy act, we give thee
clemency and bid thee speak."
"I have sought admission to thy
council chamber that I might plead
with thee for right to ascend the
Flaming Pyre with my dead Lord,
Prince Zanzibaris."
"My daughter, thou forgettest
that thy lover bath done murder
and by the law must be denied the
holy purifying flame, and in the pit
54 The Love of Rabiacca
be slow consumed with gnawing
heat from the disintegrating Rock
of Thor * thrown out."
As though stung by a viper,
Rabiacca leaped to her feet, and dis-
regarding all the rules of reverence,
cried: "No! No! Great Father!
Not the fate of a common felon!
He whose veins the royal blood did
run! Yes, who since his brother's
death, by law, hath been our King!
Ah, thou canst not suffer such an
end for one whose valor and whose
mighty deeds, by the gods them-
selves inspired, both saved our race
and made great our name among all
the earth! And besides, 0 father,
he is my dear 'loved lord, and I
cannot bear this added shame.
* Quick lime.
The Love of RabacCa 55
Deny inc if thou wilt, but let my
lord"
"Peace, my child. Thou asketh
much and raiseth grave questiOflS
pertaining to the welfare of the
state. Perchance our council will
consider thine appeal. Thou may-
est await without."
At a motion from Votan, Rabi-
acca was led to an antechamber, a
prey to every fear, yet hoping that
her prayer would be granted.
SCENE 2. THE FLA)ÆING
PYRE AND THE PROPHECY
After much grave discussion, the
council decided it would best serve
the ends of state, and pacify the
followers of the Prince, to allow
Zanzibaris to be burned, but with-
out the resinous woods, oils, spices,
56 The Love of Rabiacca
and fragrant herbs customary for
one of his royal rank. Rabiacca
was given permission to mount the
pyre with him, for although they
had not been wed, yet the blood
ceremony of betrothal was held al-
most as sacred as the marriage rite
itself, and Rabiacca's great desire
to sacrifice herself with her lord,
criminal though he was, won for
her the unusual privilege. All the
ceremonial dances and stately pag-.
eantry, however, that would have
accompanied the burning of a
Prince or King, were to be denied,
and only the rites belonging to a
warrior of noble birth permitted.
The funeral pyres were arranged
for the following evening at sunset.
Around that of Zanzibaris, situated
apart at some distance from the
others, were gathered a great con-
The Love of RabiacccÌ 57
course of fighting men and chief-
tains whom he bad led to victory in
the many campaigns which he had
commanded.
Only a small procession of priests
approached the pyre upon which the
body of Zanzibaris already lay in
state, and in their midst walked
Rabiacca. She was clad in a simple
flowing robe of white, with her
blue-black hair smoothly parted in
the middle, falling over her bosom
in two large braids decorated with
bright grasses and gay, colored
feathers. Upon her brow was
painted the mark worn by,yirgins
when prepared for the marriage
ceremony. She circled with the
priests three times around the bier
and then ascended to her place upon
the pile. As the priests applied the
torch below, she placed a farewell
58 The Love of Rabiacca
kiss upon the lips of the dead
Prince and stood erect. As the
flames rose higher and higher and
began to lick about her naked feet,
and scorch her robe, she raised her
bracelet-covered arms amid the
smoke and shooting tongues of
flame and chanted her last farewell.
"Ascend, ye sacred flames, and
wrap me dose! Clasped in thy
bright and purifying arms, waft me
to heaven with my dear Lord, that
I may serve him there and win
again, perchance, the love he once
did bear for me. Thus without aid
of cactus' smoke or burning herb,
nor yet of agave's juice, I welcome
to my tender flesh Thy piercing
darts, and bid them burn away the
dross of earthly form that keeps my
spirit back from joining my 'loved
lord."
The Love of Rabiacca 59
Raised by the strength of her
emotions to a divine frenzy, she
cried out as if inspired:
"Hear ye my prophecy, 0 ye
priests and men of Tulapan! Our
Queen shall come again! She is
not dead! Even now she bids me
tell thee that the third stone from
the altar's top ye will find unloosed,
and behind it is a scroll on which
is written what ye shall do to keep
her earthly form yet living until the
time of her return. Seek ye it out
and follow well its commands! But
the others must with me still fol-
low her into the shades and serve
her there through many lives until
our task is done. Then will she re-
turn to you and bring again her
own. So reap we all what we have
sown. Zanzibaris !My queen!
My lord !.Gladly do I come! I
come !"
