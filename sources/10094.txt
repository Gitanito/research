  		              		Experience Description   

    Here's a little background information which led to my NDE. I chose to run away from home at 15 and a half. Little did I know my parents had decided if I wanted to run away, to let me go my way. At the time I had been using marijuana to escape from my bad life experiences. I stayed with my Grandfather(on Moms side). By the time I was 16 and a half, I left my Grandfather's. In the previous year I also discovered alcohol. My addiction was just starting. I had heard Ft. Lauderdale, Fl. was a happening town so I went. Keep in mind I had often had trouble sleeping. I bounced around alot, would stay at one place the would have to find another place, etc. etc. 

  Then it happened.

  I was 17 when I had my NDE. I lived with a nurse. Because I suffered from insomnia, my nurse friend suggested a placidil(a heavy duty sleeping pill). I took it and at the time was drinking beer. About 45 minutes later, I was talking to my Mom on the phone and collapsed on the floor. Had a cigarette burning my leg but couldn't move.

  The best way I can describe what happened, what I felt and what happened is like this. Imagine the euphoria you feel from drinking or drugging about 10 times intenser than the original feeling. That's  how it felt at first. I saw my entire life flash before me. The good and bad. Then I saw a tunnel with brightness, brighter than the sun pulling me towards it, the bright light was at the end of the tunnel and I could see my body on the floor. It was like I floated above it. The one thing I immediately picked up on was an inner peace like no other. Then I reached then end of the tunnel. What I saw was amazing, it was Jesus. I asked him why. He replied if want to enter here you have to change. I said but I don't want to go, it's so peaceful here. Jesus said you have to go back it's not your time yet. I again said I don't want to go. Jesus said, tell them about me. I said I'll give them hell. Jesus grimaced as if he didn't care for that comment. My last words to him was, you know what I mean. This was said as I was going back to earth.
  
  Well it wasn't long after that I relocated to Houston, Tx. I had heard it was booming with jobs. Went through several places to live. Eventually I attempted suicide in 1981. My Father had said once I turned 18, I would have to fend for myself. At the time I did this, I had lost my job and my roommate announced he was moving to California to his parents and I couldn't go there with him. With all that going on, it's why I did what I did. Long story short, my Dad said I could come home. The time frame of this was like late September of 1981. In February of 1982 I moved Washington, DC. because of my job. By the end of February I quit my job and relocated back to Houston, Tx. 

Meanwhile, my alcoholism and addiction had taken off. Also too, at this time period I was very agnostic. Then I had a couple geographical cures(left where I lived and went to a place nobody knew me). Went to California a couple times and Florida a couple times. But would always return to Houston, Tx. By 1983 I settled in Houston until 1986. The recession had caught up to Houston and I had two choices stay and eventually get evicted from where I was stay or leave and relocate to New Hampshire. I relocated to NH. I stayed in NH. until 1990 and relocated to Fl. Stayed in Fl. Until 2001, relocated to Cleveland, Oh. for 5 months, the moved to where I am now Dundalk, Md.

  In 1988 in NH. I got a DUI. this is when I finally realized I had to change or eventually die. Even had a Dr. tell me I would be dead in 6 months to  a year if I didn't. That was my wake up call. So, I started with A.A. When I went to Fl. I continued my A.A. recovery. In a nutshell A.A. led me to a relationship with a higher power and in turn led me to accept God and Jesus. Then ultimately led me back to going to church.

  What I got from this was Jesus telling me to turn back to him.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Yes     It was like my spirit (that's the best way I can describe it) was being pulled through the tunnel by, at the moment, an energy source I didn't know of or unknown to me at the time.

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         At first, I felt shocked briefly because of the fact it was like I could see my body on earth and at the same time I was out of it.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Unaffiliated- Agnostic   From birth until was about 13 I attended church. My parents removed me from the church I attended, citing the church was a bad influence on me. Some life experiences I had made me question if there was really a God or Jesus.

What is your religion now?         Other or several faiths   Spiritual not religious, Southern Baptist, Baptist and a touch of Buddhist.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     At the time I was somewhat agnostic. I knew of Jesus, God and Heaven but my belief had been watered down a lot. When I met Jesus face to face in the afterlife, that was confirmation of Jesus/God being real.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     The meeting and talking to Jesus reaffirmed my belief he does exist.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   I saw Jesus  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     Jesus told me before I was told I had to go back, to tell them(people on earth)that Jesus/God is real.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     The fact that I met Jesus and spoke to him, yeah there is mystical universal connection does exist.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I met and spoke to Jesus  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes    I believe Jesus let me experience this to communicate to me that he is real and to tell others of his existence.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     The fact that I met and spoke to Jesus. The fact I existed as a spirit but to see my earthly body.

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life     I have noticed that I'm quite sensitive to visions (very immediate future, never long-term future) and they are very vivid, sometime very graphic. Also, too, I noticed I've become more sensitive to spirit presence/visitation.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I noticed that when I'm with a loved one, it's like there's a real intense bond at first, then it seems to fade, sometimes to the point of them leaving the relationship.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The best way I can describe it is, I remember everything that happened with the NDE but life remembrance seems less clear at times.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     The sensitivity to spirit visitation/presence.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes, just meeting, seeing and talking to Jesus that itself was, to me, a very intense(in a good positive way)experience.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Two days, that's what I was told by my nurse roommate at the time, that I had be asleep for. When I told my roommate about the NDE, she was like, you must have had one hell of a hallucination. I shared it a couple times between 1977 and current day and had a mixed reaction. Some said it was a drug induced hallucination and others believed it. I chose to share it now publicly (I shared in a NDE Facebook Group) because, I feel the world needs to know and two, I'm tired of being looked at as a psycho because I experienced this. Lastly, I shared it publicly to meet people who could identify with it and perhaps learn/grow more.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I generally don't take things for granted. At first (before NDE) I was between I'll believe it when I see it or I have my doubts. After NDE I take things at face value, at times with some skepticism (you know how some people like to tell tall tales, in that vain of skepticism).  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Hey I saw what I saw, I did what I did. To me it is a very real experience.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Nope, your 7 pages is very thorough.
