  		              		Experience Description   

  I was brought into the operating room for gallbladder surgery.  The IV was unsuccessful in pre-op, so no drugs or sedation had been given ahead of surgery. When the mask was placed on me, things got fuzzy.  I heard the anesthesiologist say, 'plan b'. I could see him, even though he was behind me.  He then said, 'She is going in too deep'.  

  All of a sudden, I was in a black tunnel, like going down a drain.  This was scary and I felt like something was wrong. I remember saying 'no, no, no!' Emerging from the tunnel, it was like a nuclear explosion went off on the horizon line and I was consumed by a bright light that was 360 degrees all around me.  As the light engulfed me, all the sounds and voices from the operating room faded away. The last thing I remember hearing was the beeping of the heart monitor.  

  Then there was only silence like I’ve never felt. So bright and so still. I began to move forward in the light and call 'Jesus' over and over. I went from being 'afraid to leave' to 'feeling peace'.  Then I saw my three children’s faces flash before my eyes. After seeing this rapid slideshow of images, it was as if I crashed back onto the operating table. 

The voices and machinery were deafening.  It was so loud it hurt my body.  The physician's assistant, who I could see, said, 'She still has a good grip on my hand'. Then everything faded to black and I woke up in recovery.
