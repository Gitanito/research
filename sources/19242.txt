the best way to understand nonlocality
is to understand that in both physics
and in consciousness there is a
connection that exists amongst all
things from photons to people to
awareness that isn&#39;t limited by space
and time per se that are woven within
each other dr. Emoto the Japanese
scientists began to experiment with
water and people putting their intent on
the water and he did photography that
would show these different crystalline
structures if it was a very negative
emotion the crystals would be all
dissonant but when it was highly ordered
conscious or loved the structures were
these beautiful ordered structures that
he would photograph and this was
repeated by other scientists water has a
crystalline component but it&#39;s also tied
into like all matter in space and time
in the universe to this consciousness
force field if you enter into just a
quiet state of consciousness and intend
something very positive
it literally altered the structure of
the water itself nonlocality is ocorant
with modern physics Schrodinger talked
about nonlocality and entanglement in
the 1920s but really wasn&#39;t until 1970
that Friedman and clauser at Berkeley
discovered that photons born together
like identical twins can move off into
the distance from one another and you
grab one twin and you change the
polarization of the other even though
they&#39;re very very far apart and the
lingo describing this in modern physics
as we would say they&#39;re entangled with
one another
