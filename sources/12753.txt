  		              		Experience Description   

    The memory starts with my staring at the pink and blue animals on my undershirt. I liked it and  was touching them on the shirt. I looked up and  was staring at these big steel bars in front of me.  The next thing was that I was feeling so cold; so very, very cold. I was shivering and not liking it.  Then I was looking through a short hall with a closed door at the end.  I heard footsteps getting closer and closer to the door on the other side.  I was frightened of it because I didn't know who was on the other side. When the footsteps stopped, I was in front of the door and not down the little hall. But I had never moved. I was not standing or sitting, I just was staring at the door. I wasn't afraid. Then a man's voice said, 'If you want to leave, all you have do is open the door and step through. If you want to, you can.' I said without baby talk, maybe it was thinking my answers but I responded, 'No, I want to stay.' I did not take long in knowing this and that it was the right thing to do. I had something to do, though I did not know what it was and I did not wonder about it. 
  
  I should tell you how I know this was not a dream. It was real since no one would talk with me about it. For all my first 20 years I thought it was just a dream. My mother and I were shopping for baby clothes for my first born, who was due soon. I saw an undershirt with pink and blue animals on it and I touched them saying 'I wore one just like this when I was a baby.' My mother said looking at it, 'Yes exactly like it. How did you know that?' I told her I dreamt it and proceeded to tell her this dream. When finished, she had the look of shock and bewilderment. I asked, 'What?' She said, 'It was not a dream, but how could you possibly remember that? You were only a baby.' I didn't know what she was talking about, so I asked. She said that while in the hospital at about 18 months old, I did wear a undershirt with pink and blue animals on it. Back then the cribs the babies stayed in were big with steel bars. Of course, hospitals kept it very cold. I think because I had a fever. I began dehydrating to the point they admitted me and had no idea why it was happening. She said at one point they were worried that I would die because over a two week stay, I became progressively worse. Then one day, I recovered as fast as I had become ill. She said the difference was like  night and day. The doctors were never able to explain it and she never did have a diagnosis. The doctors were amazed but everyone was just happy I was well again. That's  how I know I crossed over and I could have left earth if I wanted. I know this much, I did not make a choice to remain because of any person. It was something else. I wasn't thinking about my parents or anyone just that I should stay.

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I had no memory of life's experience at that time I remember the NDE  
  
Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     I sense things and I'm usually correct. I knew many things I should not have as a child. Most about my own children to come into my future. Proven correct.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          One stands out now. Baby's on the other side think like adults, they can make important decisions. I don't think heaven has any babies. We are all adults until we come here.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     I was a baby, do not recall  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Uncertain   Not sure what you mean  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         It was real. I don't know the whole truth on why and never will. I truly have a gift of detachment and do not feel anyone really loves me when they say and I always feel things can end without warning. These things I believe are a direct result of my mother's actions and life situations prior to becoming ill and entering death at its door. I am not sure this was the life intended for me. I think something changed that allowed for me to have the option of withdrawing from the earthly experience. I have always felt I did not belong...anywhere.  

  Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Maybe one thing. What if someone had more than one NDE? Maybe have them compare experiences.
