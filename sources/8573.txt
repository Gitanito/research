  ABSTRACT:&nbsp;    This is a retrospective study of near-death   experiencers who died from drowning.&nbsp; The main question was whether the cause of   death affected the experience in any way.&nbsp; Comparisons were done between   drowning and cardiac arrest victims and then cross-compared with a population of   general NDEs. Since almost 70% of the drowning victims were children, age was   also explored as a factor.&nbsp; The data suggests that there is a statistically   significant difference in the NDE according to the type of death one   experiences.&nbsp;

INTRODUCTION
  
  Recently, it seemed   like a lot of child drowning near death experiences (NDEs) were submitted to the   Near Death Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) via the web survey form.&nbsp; I   was curious to find out if there were any difference between child and adult   drowning experiences and between drowning experiences versus other types of   near-death experiences.&nbsp;

An article written by   Russell Noyes and Donald Slymen, from the early days when NDE research was   primarily considered a brain-chemistry phenomena, studied the impact of   different ways of dying on certain categories of experiences (Noyes, 1984).&nbsp;   Noyes and Slymen studied falls, drownings, automobile accidents, miscellaneous   accidents, and serious illnesses.&nbsp; There was no delineation between people who   actually died and those people who were seriously ill and close to death.&nbsp; The   subjective responses were categorized according to qualities containing the   elements of depersonalization, hyper-alertness, and mystical consciousness.&nbsp;

The mystical factors   contained elements such as &quot;great understanding, sense of harmony or unity,   feelings of joy, and revelations.&quot; (Noyes, pp. 20-21)&nbsp; Also included were those   items labeled as &quot;hallucinatory intensity&quot; such as sharp or vivid images, colors   and visions.&nbsp; The doctors noted that &quot;hallucinations&quot; were responsible for   panoramic memories (p. 21).&nbsp; Although the study had some clear biases, there weren't a lot of studies or accepted scientific language at the time to describe   NDEs in the 1980's.&nbsp;

Depersonalization   factors consisted of items from psychological &quot;syndromes&quot; such as unreal   observations, detachment from the body and the world, a wall between self and   emotions, and altered impressions of time (p. 22).&nbsp; Hyper-alertness factors were   described as vivid thoughts, sharper vision, more acute hearing, and other   heighten sensory perception (p.22).&nbsp; There was overlap in hyper-alertness and   mystical experiences.&nbsp; The mystical experiences seemed to focus on whether the   colors or visions were reported, while the hyper-alertness factors concentrated   on the lucidity of the experience. &nbsp;Accident and fall victims reported more   depersonalization factors than drowning or miscellaneous accident victims.&nbsp;   Younger people were more likely to report mystical factors (p.26).&nbsp;

Although this early   work was skewed, this was valuable work in that it stands for the proposition   that the type of death might rule the depth, perception, recall, and integration   of the experience; or perhaps even control to some extent what lessons are   brought back when returning to earth.&nbsp;

METHODOLOGY

This study is a   retrospective review of data received from an Internet survey on the Near Death   Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) website     www.nderf.org    (Long, 2003). Out of a total of 682 experiences submitted to the   website, 329 of these experiences met the research definition of NDE as defined   as, &quot;A lucid experience associated with perceived consciousness apart from the   body occurring at the time of actual or threatened imminent death&quot;&nbsp;(Long).&nbsp;   There were 307 NDErs who answered how their NDE was caused.&nbsp; This   answer was either in a narrative description when selecting the check box answer   &quot;Other&quot; in either the question asking about condition around the time of   experience or other circumstances around the time of the experience, or in   describing the experience in the narrative box asking the person to describe   their experience in detail.&nbsp;

A review of all   narratives describing the drowning experience was tabulated according to the   WCEI (Components and Weights for the Core Experience Index) scale (Ring, K.,   1984, p. 38).&nbsp;&nbsp; Results were then cross-compared with Ken Ring's results from   102 NDErs.&nbsp; In December 2001, Dr. Pim van Lommel published a ground-breaking   Dutch study on 344 cardiac patients where were successfully resuscitated after   cardiac arrest (van Lommel, 2001).&nbsp; The WCEI score from this study was also used   and cross compared with the drowning NDEs and general NDEs from Ken Ring's   study.

Dr. Jeffrey Long   developed an Excel based chi-square calculation engine based on over 2,000 data   points.&nbsp; Calculations are automatically updated when new data is added.&nbsp;   Comparison data from this chi-square engine was used in analysis.

RESULTS

The chart below shows   the relative percentages of deep, moderate, or non-experiencers in the   categories of drowning, cardiac arrests, and a general NDE population.&nbsp; Analyzed   were 405 narratives with a total of 23 drowning experiences, of which 16 (69.6%)   were children and 7 (30.4%) were adults.&nbsp; Of note is that drowning NDEs appear   to have higher percentages (65.2%) of deep experiences compared to a general NDE   population or with cardiac arrests.&nbsp; The highest group of non-experiencers   appears to be in the general NDE population with a total of 52%.&nbsp;

When comparing the   expected and observed outcomes, the chi square test shows whether the observed   difference is due to chance or if it is statistically significant.&nbsp; The lower   the p-value, the less the difference is due to chance alone.&nbsp; A p-value under   0.01 is usually considered statistically significant.&nbsp; Here, there were 307   analyzable experiences using this method with 19 (6.19%) who reported dying by   drowning.&nbsp; Analyzable experiences consist of those people who answered the web   survey form and excludes those NDErs who only wrote narratives.&nbsp; Various   elements of the NDE were cross-compared with certain groups to determine if any   NDE elements were statistically significant.&nbsp;

There was no   significant difference between the database total of 79 children and the 13   children whose NDE was caused by drowning.&nbsp; The numbers were too small for   cross-comparison of drowning experiences between adults and children.&nbsp; There   were several statistically significant elements between all children and all   adults.&nbsp; However, these differences could be explained by virtue of a longer   life expectancy.&nbsp; For example, more of the child NDErs reported a higher   incidence in the categories of &quot;paranormal gifts&quot; and &quot;if anything reproduced   the NDE&quot; than adults.&nbsp; It would be expected that the longer that one lives, the   more of a chance that they would have of exploring paranormal gifts and to   encounter other experiences that might reproduce the NDE.

DISCUSSION

Although a bit of   dark humor comes up from time to time, such as in contemplating questions like   &quot;how dead is dead?,&quot; this is a valid concern when comparing the experiences of   death by drowning, death by cardiac arrest, or general dying experiences.&nbsp; It is   possible that drowning and cardiac arrest may be more accurately perceived as   &quot;death&quot; than the general NDE group.&nbsp; This would mean that a study group could be   skewed by whether or not they actually died or were only close to death.&nbsp; From   the data, it suggests that near death-like experiences generally do not have the   depth or intensity as a person who actually dies and comes back.&nbsp; Please note   that this is not to say that the effects of a NDE versus a NDE-like event are   any less significant to the experiencer.&nbsp; That is an entirely different issue   and beyond the scope of this paper.

A chi square analysis   between the expected and observed values between all three categories is   statistically significant with the following p-values:

  Drowning and cardiac victims &nbsp;&nbsp; 0.047
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General and   cardiac victims&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.078
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General and   drowning victims&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00046&nbsp;

In the van Lommel   study, it was noted that one could not predict who would have a NDE or how deep   the experience would be (van Lommel, p. 2039).&nbsp; However, he did observe that age   may play a part in the process, with younger patients more likely to have a NDE   and subsequently report a core NDE.&nbsp; It appears that those who die by drowning   have more core experiences that those who die by cardiac arrest.&nbsp; As noted   earlier, the drowning victims consisted of almost 70% children, as defined as   under the age of 18.&nbsp; There were no frightening experiences reported by drowning   victims.&nbsp; The chi square analysis between adults and children yield no   statistically significant differences.&nbsp; Consequently, while it is possible that   the drowning victims experienced more core and moderate experiences due to age,   it is doubtful that age alone is responsible for the differences seen between   drowning, cardiac arrest, and a general NDE population.

Is there a certain   type of death that is less traumatic for the soul? Or perhaps one that is less   stressful or less damaging to the interface between brain and mind?&nbsp; Emotions   organize memories and enhance memory retrieval (Long Jody, Soulmates,   2002).&nbsp; Emotions are also the universal constant in that they exist both, while   in the body and on the other side (Long, Jody, Emotions, 2003).&nbsp; Just as   water birthing is considered less traumatic for a baby, perhaps a water death is   an easier transition between the worlds than other types of death.

From studying the   effect of emotions on brain and consciousness, memory organization and   integration of the NDE, drowning may be a less stressful dying process. Perhaps   children are less rigid in their belief system and therefore less emotionally   bruised by drowning - ergo, they are more able to experience, remember and   integrate a NDE than an adult.&nbsp; At any rate, the data suggests that there could   be a type of death where the experience is more easily remembered and integrated   into earthly life.&nbsp; Certainly, the way a person dies could be a major   contributory factor in the dying process.

The preceding   hypotheses present some intriguing possibilities, but needs further study.&nbsp; A   multivariate statistical analysis may help determine for sure if the differences   are due to age, some other variable or if the statistical significance noted   above is due solely to the physical cause of the NDE and the amount of emotional   shock received from the trauma.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
