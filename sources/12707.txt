  		              		Experience Description   

    In the Army, I was doing flood duty.  It was very hot out all day, so I decided to get a saline IV to rehydrate.  After I was hooked up to the IV, I became dizzy, my eyes blurred and I was sweating profusely. My eyes rolled up to the back of my head and my heart stopped. An army medic was nearby.  

  Then, I became part of something I can’t fully describe.  I had no more pain. I was euphoric and had no anxiety.  I knew I had died and I was very happy! 

  I was resuscitated. When I came back, the pain returned. I was totally pissed at the medic. It seemed like I had been gone for a long time but the medic said I was dead less than 30 seconds. The saline bags had been left out in the sun all day and were roughly 120 degrees, causing my body to go into shock.
