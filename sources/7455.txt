            Experience Description :   

  When I was one and a half I became very ill. On the way to the doctors, I went into a seizure which trigged cardiac arrest, both occurred five times in total. I was flat-lined for a short time in transportation from one hospital to another. I had no religious background I was baptized and that was it. I came back talking about heaven and telling my grandfather he would be warm there, but I didn't even know what heaven was. I was drawing pictures saying it was Jesus or relatives I never met.
