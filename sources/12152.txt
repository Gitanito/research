  		              		Experience Description   

    On 12/20/2012 I had a serious heart attack.  This was  my second heart attack with the first incident happening when I was age 49. At the hospital emergency room my heart suddenly stopped and was restarted with a defibrillator. Then my heart stopped again and I had an NDE. 

  I found myself walking or standing in a beautiful rolling meadow with plush green grass. The sky was very blue.  It was warm and peaceful; and I felt safe. I vividly remember looking up onto a knoll and seeing a row of four extremely bright white buildings.  The buildings had strange symbols on the side facing me. The symbols looked like nothing I've ever seen before and unfortunately cannot recall them exactly so I cannot draw them. However, the symbols were made up of lines similar to Asian writing. I somehow knew that I was supposed to go to the white buildings. So,  I began walking that way. I do not recall if I had a body; I just remember heading towards the buildings. 

  The experience ended when my body was shocked again.  I was back in my body aware that a nurse was yelling at me to open my eyes.

  It's now been 7 years since this happened and I have recovered quite well from the heart attack. The memory of this experience is still strong.  This experience seemed very real and I cannot recall any memory in my life that resembles this experience.  

  After my experience, I did not find god, nor did I wake up with strange powers such as ESP as many other experiencers describe. My life just went on as normal.
