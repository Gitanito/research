       Certain people among us have   	the gift of automatic writing, sometimes known as channeling.&nbsp; They hold a   	pen over a tablet and allow a discarnate spirit to do the writing through   	them.&nbsp; Sometimes it is done with a typewriter or orally when the spirit   	speaks trough the channel.&nbsp; British author, Elsa Barker had the gift.&nbsp;   	One evening she was inspired to channel a message from her friend, Judge   	David Patterson Hatch.&nbsp; Unbeknown to Ms Barker, Judge Hatch had died six   	thousand miles away in California.&nbsp;  Thus   	began a series of letters from the other side describing Judge Hatch's   	adventures in the afterlife.&nbsp; The letters were compiled and published in a   	book, LETTERS FROM A LIVING DEAD MAN in 1914.

  	&nbsp;

  	Other books have been   	channeled from discarnates on the other side of the veil since LETTERS FROM   	A LIVING DEAD MAN was published in 1914, but none has equaled this classic.&nbsp;   	Thus it is republished in 2006.&nbsp; Readers are always&nbsp;inspired and intrigued   	by its timeless message.
