  		              		Experience Description   

    At the time of my NDE, I was around four months pregnant with my first child.  My husband and I were on a short break with another couple.  The men had put our boat into the lake and were bringing the trailer back out of the water.  One of our friends cut his hand whilst winding up the boat winch.  The injury appeared quite severe and there was a lot of blood.  We all headed back toward our car so that we could take our friend to have his hand attended to at the local hospital.  I began to feel unwell, so I reached out to my husband who was close by.  The next earthly memory I have is of sitting in our car with my husband leaning over me.
  
  According to my husband, I collapsed.  He picked me up and placed me in the passenger seat of our car.  He later told me that I had stopped breathing, my pallor was grey and my eyes were open and rolled back.  As far as he could tell, I was dead.  He says he actually slapped me after attempting every other way he could think of to bring me back.  It was at that moment I returned.
  
  What I experienced was vastly different. I found myself walking through a tunnel of light. The tunnel opened out to a garden where I could hear children laughing and playing.  I never actually got to the garden. All I could see was a bright white expanse, but I knew the children were there and that is where I wanted to go.  I don't recall if I actually saw the man or just knew of his presence. A man, who I have always believed to be Jesus Christ, came to me in the tunnel and told me that I couldn't go where the children were. He told me  that I had to go back where I had come from.  I remember feeling quite disappointed that I wasn't allowed to be with the children.  It sounded like such a wonderful place.
