WHY PYRAMIDS APPEARED ON THE EARTH
Why Pyramids Appear on the Earth
THE TWENTY-SECOND LECTURE
E ARE now considering in these lectures one
of the most vital and far-reaching sequences
in the social history of our planet: that period
when Atlantis in her decadence approached
the end of her existence and the great Adite
Civilization in and around the Mediterranean
basin began to germinate and come to flower,
preserving the culture of which we are in­
heritors at the present moment.
Most occult researchers as well as historians
ancient and modern, place this period in the
neighborhood of 11,500 years ago. The record preserved by the Is­
raelite high priest Ezra, making his compendium of sacred information
at Jerusalem in the year 757 B. C., which we have had presented to
us as the Biblical Old Testament, asks us to accept that Adam himself
as the first literal individual, was created in the year 4000 B. C., and
that the Flood of Noah took place 1,656 years later in the year 2,344
B. C. t?
Millions of people today place a childish and literal faith in these fig­
ures, because Ezra contrived to make it appear that they had the
stamp of divine authority. They think it some sort of unforgivable
sin to question them.
Irrefutable scientific evidence attests that in the first place Adam was
not a literal man, and in the second place the Hebraic account hope­
lessly confuses social and terrain conditions prevailing on the early
continents of Atlantis and Lemuria with pristine planetary conditions
3
PER 16 '4?
prevailing under the many water canopies, as I have previously d
cribed to you. ^
In the third place, the arrogant bigotry and ignorance of Ezra are di*.
closed by a study of the contemporaneous records of contiguous peo­
ples: the Lemurian Chinese, for instance. Their particular area of
the planet, known as eastern Asia, was not inundated by the Flood
of Noah, or precipitation of the last vapor canopy; neither does it
seem to have been visited by the Fiery Monster from on High, al­
though the Chinese knew about it and were so impressed by it that
the episode worked its way into their religious observances and ob­
viously resulted in the symbolism of the sacred Chinese Dragon. In
tracing back over these vague and uncertain origins of religious ob­
servances in Asia, it may also be true that the Asiatic Lemurians, as
well as the Mongolian Atlanteans, in some way associated this Drag­
on-Monster from the heavens with the Sacred Serpent symbology
deriving from the much earlier period when the carbonaceous equa­
tor-ring was plainly visible some 22,000 miles overhead. We can
easily see that the Chinese Lemurians might deify the Dragon as be­
ing particularly beneficent to them, and thus commanding adulation,
because in afflicting earth as a planet it had spared their specific lo­
cality and thus shown itself as favoring them above all other peoples.
What we are truly interested in today is the fact that without these
cataclysms affecting their civilization, or social evolution, they were
able to preserve more or less authentic records going back over the
flights of time on this planet, and accurately date great royal epochs
as maintaining long before the times of the vital statistics recorded
by Ezra.
NE OF the reasons why the educated Chinese look with
adult tolerance on some of the childish claims of what
might be called Old Testament Christianity, is the ob­
vious inaccuracy of our earthly human records. When
a missionary, relying on his Bible chronology, tries to
tell a Chinaman that the first man was created only
5,941 years bygone, and that the Great Flood of Noah, or the Uni­
versal Deluge, obliterated every vestige of human life from the plan­
et—except those few persons voyaging in the Ark—a mere 4,285
years ago, he is met with a sort of polite cynicism. “But how can
4
such a thing be possible?” the educated son of Cathay wants to know.
“Our records show that at the time you say the first man was being
made of dust of the ground, our people were in existence by the
millions and were enjoying a much higher state of civilization than
anything offered anywhere in the world at present.” The poor, ad­
dled missionary, trying to build his case on the abysmal ignorance of
Ezra, often has the audacity to retort: “Your records are wrong,” or
“You have been instructed of the Evil One.” The Chinaman feels
as outraged as an American would feel if someone told him Colum­
bus did not discover this continent in 1492, or if a citizen of the Unit­
ed States were told that the date of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence in 1776 was a mythical happening set by Satan. The
citizen would declare: “People who say this last must be plain luna­
tics, or of Satan themselves and striving to breed historical confu-
ions among us.” The Asiatic reasons to himself: “If these foreign­
ers affecting to speak of God cannot be accurate in their early chro­
nologies, what assurance have we that they are accurate in their
claims and contentions about the importance of their Jesus-God in
the drama of salvation?” And to all reasonable human beings, such
Asiatics are absolutely right.
The whole scheme of modern Christianity, at least in its theological
aspects, has gotten off on the wrong foot because of a canard foisted
on the peoples of so-called Christendom by one particular tribe among
the Israelites called the Judans and known today as Jews.
Ezra wanted to give a broken hodge-podge of Israelitish peoples a
background and a literature. He wanted to preserve his own priest­
ly class and retain an inviolate stranglehold on humankind that came
within the influence of that priestly caste. So he got together all the
data of his time and place and put them in more or less orderly form.
Of course he wrote from the biased and prejudiced standpoint and
psychology of the Hebrews themselves—a trait noticeable among
all races whereby they imagine that they are the people, and the only
human breed admired and favored of the Almighty. But his su­
preme mischief was to couch it in a terminology that made it appear
that God himself dictated it and put the stamp of accuracy upon it. £

HE WHOLE performance is quite as absurd as if a m
o
A
ern department store of Cohen & Katz wanted to
their emporium prestige in the eyes of all creeds and
races in a certain city. So they call in the local rabbi
and say to him: “Please write a history of our store.
Write it in such a way that it will appear to our custom-
ers that we are the only store in this city that enjoys the favor of
God Almighty. Tell the people to whom your record comes, that
at certain times and seasons, God Almighty sneaks down from H
is
celestial abode, and buys His own pants in our men’s outfitting de­
partment. Also do not forget to include that He is likewise a silent
partner in our firm and periodically comes into the office and goes
over our books with us, to make certain He gets His share of the
profits. Of course, Rabbi, we understand that other firms in this
city will say your document and its claims are a lot of impious non­
sense. They may even use force against us to destroy our emporium
making such claims. They may even say God doesn t wear pants at
all, much less acquire His own clothing from our sales departments.
But we do not want this document for the present generation. In
time we, and all our competitors, and the customers of all, will die.
If our store continues on, however, the children of the third or fourth
generation may find your document and exclaim: ‘See hereI W
e
have turned up authentic parchments disclosing that God himself is
in partnership with Cohen & Katz. What a frightful error we are
making to buy our pants of Kelly & Obrien. Let us correct it as
soon as we humanly can. Kelly & Obrien are without the pale of
God Almighty’s favor. This precious document says so. Cohen &
Katz are divinely appointed to dispense pants to us over this cycle of
civilization—they are the Chosen People, and to challenge this docu­
ment that says so, is to court not only death from His wrath, but eter­
nity in the fires of a perpetual roasting place called Hell.* This is what
we want you to say in your document, Rabbi, and we will see that
our sons Izzy and Jacob, and our grandchildren Sammy and Seth and
Moses, give your document the widest advertising possible so that in
years to come the firm of Cohen & Katz become purveyors of pants
to the whole human universe with none to challenge their omnipotent
franchise.** ip ip
This is exactly what happened in a larger sense in Jerusalem in 757
6
B. C. And we today, the progeny of the “third and fourth genera­
tions," are accepting the rabbi’s advertising document about “Cohen
& Katz" as divine truth, merely because the descendants of “Cohen
& Katz" have found it ever to their commercial and racial advantage
to keep the canard alive. Because they have been so industrious,
based on motives that were purely selfish and introvert from the very
beginning, and at times used strategy or violence to destroy the
counterclaims or the challenges of the world races of Kellys &
Obriens, whole races now point to the “Cohen & Katz" document as
authentic and divine, exclaiming, “If it were not authentic and di­
vine, would it have met with such miraculous preservation through­
out the centuries?*' The world firms of the Kelleys & O’Briens leap
forward declaring, “But we too have documents and records quite as
authentic and well-preserved. See for yourselves!" The races of
Christendom reply, “Yes, but your records have not been audacious
enough to say that God himself bought his pants from your firms
from the very beginning. Because you have been neglectful to in­
clude this fact, we must throw your documents and records out of
court and call them profane." The retort is made: “But we said
nothing about God clothing himself in our emporiums because we
considered it blasphemous to think of God as wearing earthly trou­
sers. The whole Cohen & Katz claim is not only absurd but wicked­
ly impious. Besides, we have records showing that the firm of Cohen
& Katz has from time to time lied in their advertising, cheated their
creditors, received stolen goods from criminal fences, and sought gov­
ernment subsidies of an unfair nature. How can the great Potentate
of Love and Justice trade with such a firm of rascals and blasphem­
ers, much less be a silent partner in the concern?" “We know noth­
ingsabout that, or rather, we ignore it," declare the races of Christen­
dom. “The rabbi who wrote this grand piece of advertising for
Cohen & Katz was a holy man. As such he must have had the ear
of God. He said that God actually assurefd him that He bought His
earthly clothes from Cohen & Katz and who are we to challenge or
refute so awesome a statement? No, no! This is a divine document
and we must always revere Cohen & Katz and all their commercial
progeny as elect and chosen people." Which they blindly and stub­
bornly do.
Do you think the analogy far-fetched or ridiculous, my friends? It
7
is exactly what we are doing at the present time, and letting our
whole Christian structure rest on impious, inaccurate and rapaciom
documents. Is it any wonder that the Chinaman says gravely: “1
know not this firm of Cohen & Katz and I think they are liars and
subverters from beginning to end. I have all the ledgers and papers
of the great firm of Hop Sam Wei to show that they were doing
business quite satisfactorily before the firm of Cohen & Katz ever
came into existence. Please go back where you came from and do
not annoy me with your absurd, blasphemous and improper claims.”
And the missionary comes back to America and raises a bigger fund
of dollars than ever, to simply flood China with emissaries for “Cohen
& Katz** and try to take the kingdom of heaven by a kind of rhetor­
ical missionary violence.
O THE BIBLICAL chronology of events really taking
place about 11,500 years ago can be set aside for sane
and adult consideration of the facts. And what are
the facts?
Well, we know to begin with, that three or four vast
cycles of civilization flourished on at least two conti­
nents that have now vanished utterly, antedating two major plane­
tary catastrophes. One of these was a stupendous deluge, which
Ezra, the advertisement-writing rabbi for the “Cohen & Katz firm
of the period, had a hazy inkling of, and inscribed in his records . The
other was a great visitation of fire out of planetary space that seared
half the earth, and so knocked the planet off its true axis that all
astronomical calculations and records had to be corrected. Now
which of these came first, and is it important to know?
We look for our cues to the form or expedient used for preserving
such astronomical records, and we find them in peculiar stone struc­
tures dotting the planet here and there which today we call Pyramids.
Now when most people have pyramids brought to their attention
today, they immediately envision a series of four or five queer-look­
ing piles of stone in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, erected by that
people as tombs for its royalty. That is as far as pyramid signifi­
cance goes for them. Through the zealous efforts of a group of Eng­
lish Jews, still engaged in promoting the earthly fortunes of the di­
vine partnership of “Cohen & Katz“ with deity, the Nordic Eng-
8
lish and Americans have heard much since the War of the British-
Israel Society, that actively encourages interpretations of one par­
ticular pyramid’s measurements and eccentricities, to wit, the Great
Pyramid of Gizeh. The literature of this society seeks to show more
convincingly than ever, that at one time back in the past ages the Al­
mighty did come down and do personal business with “Cohen &
Katz,” but that some sort of squabble developed out of a whack-up
of the profits, or the manner in which the “firm” was conducted, and
that a forecast was made and recorded in stone, of the reprisals which
the cheated Divine Partner was going to take over a period of time
against the early members of the “firm.”
Unfortunately the record of the squabble is pretty sordid, but any­
thing can be forgiven a Chosen People whose advertisement-writ­
ing rabbi got his personal facts from God, and anyhow, it is far bet­
ter that the details of the quarrel be permitted to be circulated than
that no further advertising of “Cohen & Katz” be realized at all. In
other words, it is better that competitors chuckle over the squabble
in the “Cohen & Katz firm” than that the “firm” be wholly ignored
as existing in any shape today. So because orthodox studies into the
foundations of Christianity only accentuate the identification and im­
portance of the one-time divine firm of “Cohen, Katz & Jehovah, In­
corporated,” it is fitting and proper to promote the Great Pyramid
significances as far and wide as possible.
I might say, however, that there is an English secret service report in
existence, made during the great war, when prodigious sums of
money were being expended in the United States to Anglicize Ameri­
ca and retain her moral support on the side of the Allies, which dis­
cusses in detail the excellent results which were being gotten by this
British-Israel propaganda. It says in effect: “The church people of
America are ‘eating it up.’ They are being fully persuaded that the
English nation is of the Lost Tribe of Benjamin, and that the Ameri­
can people are of the Lost Tribe of Manasseh. Of course the firmer
we can make their convictions in this regard, the more we accentuate
their celestial importance in the whole social scheme of the Tribe of
Judah—which is anything but lost, except in the mazes of its own
prophetical infamies. We recommend that the government give
this branch of our propaganda-labors the fullest financial endorse­
ment.” i* 2

OW ALL of this is not saying that the Great Pyramid
does not hold divine significances, or that they are iw
accurate—for it has been proven that they are accu-
rate—neither does it detract one iota from the splendid
scientific labors carried on by Professor D. Davidson
Piazzi Smith, and others. Neither is this saying that the
English people may not be the lost Tribe of Benjamin, or the Ameri­
can people the lost Tribe of Manasseh. It is merely calling attention
to the fact that the “firm of Cohen, Katz & Jehovah” has not reduced
its advertising appropriation by one groat over the centuries, and
that other peoples and races should not be fooled by what turns out
to be clever department-store advertising and nothing more.
The fact remains that people in general do think that all the pyramids
that exist are in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, that pyramids are
strictly an Egyptian architectural phenomenon, that they are noth­
ing but tombs or storehouses for records. However pyramids, taken
abstractly, are quite something else, as we shall see in great detail
before this series of lectures is ended.
Far, far back in Atlantean days, possibly in Lemurian days, the pyra­
mid type of construction was evolved as the construction having
longest life from an architectural standpoint.
Do you get what this means!
In the first place, the pyramid type of construction presents the least
resistance to the elements. In respect to rain, they offer the inclined
plane of the modern roof, permitting such falling waters to run off
with minimum destruction of the materials composing it. In the
matter of wind or sand erosion, they present a constantly dwindling
surface up to a peak, meaning a minimum presentation of surface to
take the destructive and abraiding blasts. In the matter of earth­
quakes, the maximum of foundation-stability is assured, with an ever
lessening tonnage as the structure takes on altitude.
This sort of building is the final word in longevity of structure as
against any natural jeopardies that might affect it. It is well-nigh di­
vine in its cleverness. It even presents certain defenses against hu­
man attack on that which may be buried in the heart of each pyramid.
For if the attackers or despoilers would burrow into such stonework,
they would encounter maximum resistance at ground level. In the
exact ratio that they climbed higher to decrease this resistance of
10
masonry, they would be imperiling their lives, and circumscribing
the free play of their destructive instruments by the fact of their pre­
carious altitude.
Yet that is not the only reason why pyramids were evolved in Lemuria
or Atlantis, to subsequently find erection throughout the whole earth.
The very nature of such construction was a projection into earthly
materials of celestial geometry; or rather, it gave celestial geometry
a materialistic exposition. It enabled the ancient astronomers and
mathematicians to chronicle in imperishable stone their wealth of
wisdom without having to employ human speech, which would alter
from age to age and make the wisdom of one cycle unintelligible to
the next.
At the same time that these features and factors could be incorpo­
rated in this type of building, it could be made to memorialize great
events entirely apart from the nature of the structure physically, just
as today we put up a replica of a lovely Grecian building to eulogize
Abraham Lincoln’s life and contribution to human ethics, at the na­
tion’s Capital. The fact that the building embodies all the architec­
tural esthetics of Greece in her prime, has nothing whatsoever to do
with Lincoln’s record as a statesman.
People who think that the only pyramids in existence are those in the
Valley of the Kings in Egypt, and that they were only erected as re­
ceptacles for mummies, are referred to what we have already con­
sidered concerning the greatest pyramid in the world, not in the Nile
valley at all, but right here in America, at Cholula, Mexico. There is
also a mammoth pyramid at Xcoch, Mexico, fully rivaling anything
put up by the Egyptians. But because the American pyramids were
constructed of earth instead of stone they have become badly disin­
tegrated.
We have already mentioned the dimensions and characteristics of the
pyramid of Cholula in a previous lecture, so let us take a glance about
the world and observe some of these celestial structures in countries
from South America to India. Of the Great Pyramid, and its Chris­
tian significance, I will have much to say in a subsequent lecture.
11
S IGNATIUS DONNELLY has shown us, this ^
architectural construction was originated far before th
birth of history. In the Puranas of the Hindu we read
of pyramids long antedating any which have survived to
the present. Cheops, the reputed builder of the Great
Pyramid in Egypt, was preceded by a countless host of
similar erecters whose products have long since toppled into ruins.
Fifty years ago Faber in his Origin of Pagan Idolatry placed artificial
tumuli, pyramids and pagodas in the same category, conceiving that
all were transcripts of the holy mountain which was generally sup­
posed to have stood in the center of Eden—or rather, as intimated
in more than one place by the Psalmist himself, the Garden was sit­
uated on an eminence—which we of the present are inclined to be­
lieve may be a theological hark-back to the holy mountain that stood
in the center of the Plain of Atlantis.
The Arabian traditions have linked the pyramid with the Flood. In
a manuscript preserved in the Bodleian Library and translated by Dr.
Sprenger, Abou Balkhi says: “The wise men, previous to the Flood,
foreseeing an impending judgment from heaven, either by submer­
sion or fire, which would destroy every created thing, built upon the
tops of the mountains in upper Egypt many pyramids of stone in
order to have some place of refuge against the impending calamity.
Two of these buildings exceeded the rest in height, being four hun­
dred cubits high and as many broad and as many long. They were
built with large blocks of marble, and they were so well put together
that the joints were scarcely perceptible. Upon the exterior of the
building every charm and wonder of physic was inscribed/
This tradition locates these monster structures upon the mountains
of upper Egypt. But there are no buildings of such dimensions to be
found anywhere in Egypt, nor are there mountains in the Nile Valley.
Is it not possible that we have here another reference to the great
record preserved in the Land of the Deluge? Were not the pyramids
in Egypt and America imitations of similar structures in Atlantis?
Might not the building of such gigantic edifices have given rise to
the legends current on both continents in regard to the Tower of
Babel? ±*r J
%
f
How did the human mind hit upon this singular edifice, the pyramid?
By what process of development did the human mind reach it? Why
12
should these extraordinary structures crop out on the banks of the
Nile, and amid the forests and plains of America?
And why, in all countries, should they stand with their sides square
to the four cardinal points of the compass?
Are they in this too, reminiscent of the Cross, and of the four rivers
of Atlantis that ran truly to the north, south, east and west?
Faber has many supporters of his conviction that the pyramid is a
transcript of the Sacred Mountain which “stood in the midst of
Eden,** or the Olympus of Atlantis.
Thomas Maurice, who was no mean authority, held the same view.
He conceived the uses to which pyramids in particular were ancient­
ly applied, to have been three—namely, as tombs, temples, and ob­
servatories. Now whatever may have been the actual dates of their
erection, or with whatsoever people they may have originated, wheth­
er in Africa or Asia, in the lower Valley of the Nile or on the Plains
of Chaldea, the pyramids of Egypt were destined to very opposite
purposes. According to Herodotus they were introduced by the
Hyksos, and Proclus the Platonic philosopher connects them with the
science of astronomy, a science which, he adds, the Egyptians derived
from the Chaldeans. Hence we may infer that they served as tem­
ples for planet worship as well as for observatories. Subsequently
to the descent of the shepherds, their hallowed precincts were invaded
by royalty, from motives of pride and superstition, and the principal
chamber in each used as a tomb.
HAT SABAISM once extensively prevailed in the West­
ern Hemisphere is a well authenticated fact. Sabaism,
or star worship, recognizes the unity of God, but re­
veres intelligences supposed to reside in the heavenly
bodies, or that are the heavenly bodies themselves.
Such worship is still practiced to some extent by wander­
ing tribes on the North American continent, and was the national
religion of the Peruvians at the time of the Conquest. That it was
also the religion of their more highly civilized predecessors on the
soil, south of the equator more especially, is evidenced by the remains
of fire altars, both round and square, scattered about the shores of
Lakes Umayu and Titicaca, and which are the counterparts of the
13
Gueber dokhmehs overhanging the Caspian Sea on the other side
the globe.
Accordingly we find, among these and other vestiges of antiquity that
indissolubly connected these long-since extinct populations in the
New World with the races of the Old World, the well-defined sym­
bol of the Maltese Cross. And what is the pyramid but the flat M
al­
tese Cross brought up into the third dimension?
No country in the world can compare with India for the exposition
of this pyramidal cross. There the stupendous labors of Egypt were
rivaled and sometimes surpassed. Indeed, but for the fact of such
monuments of patient industry and unexampled skill now being in
existence, the accounts of some others which have long since disap­
peared—having succumbed to the ravages of time and the fury of
the bigoted Musselman—would sound in our ears as incredible as
the story of Porenna’s Tomb which “o’ertopped old Pelion”.and made
“Ossa like a wart.”
Yet something not very dissimilar to it in character was formerly
the boast of the ancient city of Benares on the bank of the River
Ganges. I allude to the great temple of Bindh Maghu, which was de­
molished in the seventeenth century by the emperor Aurungzebe.
Tavernier, the French baron, who traveled thither about the year
1680, has preserved a brief description of it. The body of the tem­
ple was constructed in the figure of a colossal cross, with a lofty dome
at the center, above which rose a massive structure in the pyramidal
form. At the four extremities of the cross there were four other
pyramids of proportionate dimensions, and which were ascended
from the outside by steps, with balconies at stated intervals made as
places of rest, reminding us of the Temple of Belus, as described in
the pages of Herodotus.
The remains of a similar building are found at Mhuttra, on the banks
of the Jumna. This and many others, including the subterranean
temple at Elephanta, and the caverns of Ellora and Salsette, are de­
scribed in the well-known work by Maurice. Maurice adds that be­
sides these, there was yet another device in which the Hindu dis­
played the all-pervading sign. This was by pyramidal towers placed
crosswise. At the famous temple of Chillambrum on the Coroman­
del coast, there are seven lofty walls, one within another, around
the central quadrangle, and as many pyramidal gateways in the
14
midst of each side, which form the limbs of a vast cross.
In Mexico, pyramids are found everywhere Cortez, in a letter to
Charles V, states that he counted four hundred of them at Cholula.
The temples of the people were on those “high places.**
The most ancient pyramids in Mexico are at Teotihuacan, eight
leagues from the City of Mexico. The two largest were dedicated to
the sun and moon respectively, each built of cut stone with a level
area at the summit and four stages leading up to each. The larger
one is 680 feet square at the base, about 200 feet high, and covers
an area of eleven acres. This is almost identical in measurement
with the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, except that the Egyptian structure,
which has come into such prominence in recent years, has no inter­
mediate platforms up its walls.
The Pyramid of Cholula, measured by Humboldt, is 160 feet high,
1,400 feet square at the base, and covers forty-five acres. This means
that it is nearly four times the size of “the altar unto the Lord in the
midst of the land of Egypt.’*
Senor Garcia y Cubas thinks the pyramids of Teotihuacan were built
for the same purposes as those of Egypt. He considers the analogy
established in eleven particulars, as follows:
First, the site chosen is the same; second, the structures are oriented
with slight variations; third, the line through the center of the struc­
tures is the astronomical meridian; fourth, the construction in grades
and steps is the same; fifth, in both cases the larger pyramids are
devoted to the sun; sixth, the Nile has a “valley of the dead” as at
Teotihuacan there is a “street of the dead”; seventh, some monu­
ments in each class have the nature of fortifications; eighth, the small­
er mounds are of the same nature and for the same purpose; ninth,
in both countries each pyramid has a small mound joined to one of
its surfaces; tenth, the openings discovered in the Pyramid of the
Moon are also found in the Egyptian pyramids; eleventh, the inte­
rior arrangements of the pyramids are analogous.
It is objected that the American edifices are slightly different in form
from the Egyptian, in that they are truncated, or flattened at the top.
But this is by no means the universal rule. In many of the ruined
cities of Yucatan one or more pyramids have been found upon the
summit of which no traces of any building could be discovered, al­
though on surrounding structures such buildings could be found, i?
15
Waldeck found near Palenque two pyramids in a state of perfect pr*.
ervation, square at the base, pointed at the top, and thirty-one feet
high, their sides forming equilateral triangles.
There is in Egypt another form of pyramid called the mastaba,
which, like the Mexican, was flattened on the top, while in Assyria
structures flattened like the Mexican are found. The Phoenicians
also built pyramids. In the thirteenth century the Dominican B
ro-
card visited the ruins of the Phoenician city of Mrith, or Marathos,
and speaks in the strongest admiration of those pyramids of surpris­
ing grandeur, constructed of blocks of stone from twenty-six to
twenty-eight feet long, whose thickness exceeded the stature of a
tall man.
HE EGYPTIAN pyramids all stand with their sides to
the cardinal points, while many of the Mexican pyra­
mids do likewise. The Egyptian pyramids are pene­
trated by small passageways, and so too are the M
exi­
can. The Pyramid of Teotihuacan, according to Alma-
rez, has at a point sixty-nine feet from its base, a gallery
large enough to admit a man crawling on hands and knees, which
extends inward on an incline a distance of twenty-five feet and termi­
nates in two square wells or chambers, each five feet square and one
of them fifteen feet deep. Dr. Lowenstern states, according to Ban­
croft s “Native Races,“ that the gallery is 157 feet long, increasing
in height to over six feet and a half as it penetrates the pyramid, that
the well is over six feet square, extending apparently down to the
base and up to the summit, and that other cross-galleries are blocked
up by debris.
In the Pyramid of Cheops there is a similar opening or passageway
forty-nine feet above the base; it is three feet eleven inches high and
three feet five and one half inches wide; it leads down a slope to a
sepulchral chamber or well, and connects with other passageways
leading up into the body of the pyramid.
In both the Egyptian and American pyramids the outside of the
structure was covered with a thick coating of smooth polished stone
and shining cement. Humboldt considered the Pyramid of Cholula
of the same type as the Temple of Jupiter at Belus, the pyramids of
Meidoun Dachhour, and the group of Sakkarah in Egypt.
16
In both America and Egypt the pyramids were used as sepulchers,
and it is a remarkable fact that systems of earthworks and mounds,
kindred to the pyramids, are found even in England. Silsbury Hill,
at Avebury, is an artificial mound 170 feet high. It is connected with
ramparts, avenues 1,480 yards long, circular ditches and stone cir­
cles almost identical with those found in the valley of the Mississippi.
In Ireland the dead were buried in vaults of stone and the earth raised
up over them in pyramids flattened at the top. Such earthen struc­
tures were called “moats.** Stone vaults have been found at the
bases of similar truncated pyramids in Ohio.
There can be no doubt that the pyramid was a developed and per­
fected mound, and that the parent form of these perfected struc­
tures is to be found at Silsbury Hill, and in the earthern mounds of
Central America and the Mississippi Valley. Is it possible to sup­
pose all these extraordinary coincidences to be the result of acci­
dent?
We might just as well say that the similarities between the American
and English forms of government were not the result of relationship
or descent, but that men placed in similar circumstances had spon­
taneously and of necessity reached the same results.
But in the cases of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh in Egypt and Teoti-
huacan in Mexico, what could have been the sense of piling up stu­
pendous masses of stone just to reach an elevation—if elevation were
the purpose of them—when there were hundreds of natural hills or
small mountains that could have given people perspectives of dis­
tance? What purposes could have been served by erecting such mas­
sive structures, some of the stone blocks twenty-four feet square,
when they only housed dinky little passageways into stuffy little
vaults without windows and in some cases without ventilation? If
it be argued that it must have been to keep corpses of the dead from
vandals, how can this circumstance be explained: that many of the
long passageways were deliberately plugged and sealed up in course
of building the pyramids? If this was done, then the interior burial
chamber must have had to be constructed after the person to be
buried in it had died, and while his corpse was lying around some­
where awaiting the completion of such mausoleum. As the pyra­
mid building approached the top where these crypts were roofed over,
then the bodies must have been deposited almost in the pyramids’
17
finished state. But right here we are confounded by a fact in human
logic: If the bodies of dead royalty were so interred as the pyramids
grew to completion, why the trouble of creating the passageways and
sealing them, at all? Why not merely pile up the material in the
Maltese cross form, drop the body in at the top, set the upper stones
and then slide down the polished sides?
The answer is so obvious that it is tremendous.
Pyramids are not buildings as a house or a cathedral is a building;
neither were they platforms for revelation, although some of them
might have been used for observatories on account of the altitudes
they offered. An entirely different principle was being materialized
in imperishable stone. Pyramids were not, and are not, buildings, but
Things—Things created purely and simply to preserve compendiums
of information!
The circumstances that they furnish elevation, or have smaller build­
ings on their summits, or passageways burrowed into them, or cham­
bers like grave-vaults in their hearts, have led scholars all astray.
IE SAGES, savants and avatars of antiquity had certain
great wisdom which had come to them from what we
call celestial realms, or which represented the pinnacle
of the lore or culture of their periods. Now it is a fact
too little recognized, that the only language which is
universal among all sentient human beings, from the
vast star-planet Sirius to the corner grocery store in Paris, Vt., is the
language of mathematics. Two and two make four in any tongue,
among any races, of any era or cycle. If, therefore, some way
could be found by which to translate and transcribe the wisdom of a
given ,dispensation in terms of geometry, a hundred million genera­
tions could come and go but that wisdom could never perish so long
as the stone endured.
Thus men did not make pyramids to lift themselves into the air, or
cover their heads or bodies, whether alive or dead. They actualized
in stone certain great mathematical and geometrical forms and work­
ed out in them imperishable textbooks of their wisdom. It is because
the Great Pyramid in Egypt is in such an excellent state of preserva­
tion, comparatively speaking, and also because it contains formulae
that particularly apply to our present Christian era, that we are sud-
18
denly giving it such international attention. When this present era
closes, it may continue to stand for a good many hundred genera­
tions yet to be bom. But it will take its place in a category with the
old business ledger, a thing of curiosity only, as today we revere the
ledger at Mount Vernon where George Washington kept his ac­
counts. ±?r ±

Undoubtedly earlier great pyramids scattered about the earth from
Peru to India similarly served generations that were born and that
perished centuries in antiquity. Now they are falling apart and no­
body especially cares. As “things’*they are as antiquated and unim­
portant as last century’s encyclopedia. Still they continue in exis­
tence, lose their facings, accumulate gravel and soil on their stone
steps from which plants grow, and rear their turrets into starlit night
to bedevil the unlettered.
Let us turn to the Great Pyramid for a moment and see specifically
some illustrations of how the Atlanteans incorporated in stone for our
edification, some of the wisdom of their magi or wise men :
Take the number of days in the true solar year. How to record that
in stone for future generations? Well, measured down to a thou­
sandth part of an inch, the Great Pyramid from the tip of one corner
to another around its base is 9,131.05 Pyramid inches. This reduced
to cubits is 365.242. Now the orbit of the earth around the sun
is traveled in 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 49.7 seconds—
which is expressed in decimals of days by 365.242.
Now each of the four base sides of the Pyramid, measuring careful­
ly from the end of one socket in the base of the solid rock to that of
another, is exactly 9131.05 Pyramid inches. And as there are 25
Pyramid inches in one Pyramid cubit, by dividing the above inches
by 25 the result is 365.24 Pyramid cubits, which, it will be observed,
signifies the orbit of the earth expressed in terms of a cubit to a day.
But we are not yet done with the solar orbit; for we find that the
height of the north and south walls of the Queen’s Chamber added
together is equal to 365.24. Lastly, if we measure horizontally from
th$ center of the Pyramid at the top of the 35th course of masonry to
the surface of the Pyramid, we get 3652.42 Pyramid inches, which is
equal to the solar year expressed by ten inches’ being made equal to
one day.
Or take the distance of the earth from the sun: It was estimated by
19
the ancient astronomers of modern times at ten miles, then lOftnn
miles, then 2,500,000 miles, then 36,000,000 miles, and more recent­
ly 95.233,055 up to about fifty years ago. Lastly it was pronounced
91,840,000, according to the calculations of M. Poiseaux, the French
astronomer. j

Though several important expeditions have been sent out to the
various parts of the world by the cooperation of many nations to set­
tle this question, in 1874 and in 1882, by observations made during
the transit of Venus over the sun’s disc, yet the result has been only
to divide the astronomers of the leading countries into two camps,
the one declaring the distance to be between 92 1/2 and 93 million
miles and the other between 91 and 91 1/2 million miles.
The computation arrived at by M. Petrie from the Great Pyramid,
resulted in a figure which lay between those of the contending par­
ties, and disclosed with what celestial accuracy and authenticity the
avatar-Atlanteans had secured information and preserved it in stone.
M. Petrie, finding that half the diagonal of the base was to the height
of the Pyramid as 10 is to 9, multiplied the height, 5813.01, by 10
raised to the 9th power. Converting the result, 5,813,010,000,000
Pyramid inches, into British inches and then dividing by twelve inches
to the foot, he got the figure 484,901,917,500. Dividing this figure
by the 5,280 feet in a mile he got the measurement: 91,837,484, the
mean distance from the sun to the earth.
Not to bedevil you with big figures, take again the polar diameter of
the earth: One Pyramid inch is exactly the 500,000,000th part of
the earth’s polar axis of rotation. Divide the distance of the sun,
91,837,484 miles, by twice the height of the Pyramid, and the quo­
tient will be 7907.9 miles, which is the polar diameter of the earth—
equal to 20,000,000 Pyramid cubits.
And so on ad infinitum. When we come to consider the Great Pyra­
mid in its latest literal interpretations, we splurge in these interesting
compendiums of astronomical and mathematical wisdom.
What we are intent on determining in this lecture is, why pyramids
began making their appearance all over the earth, and in this sensible
grasp of the potentialities in measurements of these monuments, we
have our answer. The symmetry of these measurements one beside
another, and the mathematical calculations carried out into thou­
sandth parts of inches, could not have “just happened.” Moreover
20
they prove that man’s evolution has not been in any straight line of
culture and civilization, as the biologists or Biblical apologists would
have us accept. There have been mighty empires peopled by savants
whose knowledge as compared with ours, makes ours appear like
children’s. There stand the irrefutable attestments of it in imperish­
able stone.
UT TO get back to the opening quandary of our lec­
ture, after all these interesting divergencies—whether
the Pyramids of Egypt were in existence at the time of
the Biblical Flood, there is one important feature of the
Great Pyramid too little recognized or known.
The majesty of this structure beggars description, and
great Biblical scholars and earnest Pyramid students agree that it was
erected prior to the Flood, because its ancient sides record the fact
that at one time, at the height of three hundred feet, the walls were
lashed by the waves of some unknown sea, as the salt is still encrusted
in places upon its stones!
This seldom emphasized fact means just one of two things: either
the land on which it stands was at one time 300 feet lower than the
present level of the Mediterranean, or the whole Mediterranean basin
has been under 300 feet of water at some time or another since the
Great Pyramid was built.
In the light of all of our learning, utterly uncensored as it is, and
aided by esoterics and metaphysics, we are disposed to accept the lat­
ter explanation.
There has been a deluge in the history of the planet every time a por­
tion of the original water canopy fell. The last one, which cleaned
the heavens utterly, has probably been apostrophized in scripture as
Brother Noah’s little wet spell. But that Brother Noah was a literal
individual, and made a literal ark, and went boating for 150 days with
all his family and specimens of all the male and female animals in
creation in a “sacred” scow 625 feet long, 104 feet wide, and 62 feet
high, together with the necessary provisions to last them six months,
is another of those pretty fables that must be taken with a grain of
salt, in fact a whole sackful. Rabbi Ezra slipped up badly there in
letting his purported talk with the Almighty become too literal.
That the whole thing is an absurdity is apparent from ordinary facts
21
of metabolism and ventilation. We are told first of all that the
was sealed water-tight, which would also mean air-tight. Such
menagerie would perish for want of oxygen in the first hours of such
a grandiose boat ride. We are told that there was a window 25 inche
square in the ark’s side somewhere. But even so, try to imagine
what the sanitation of the ark must have been after the first thirty
days. Both pestilence and scurvy would most certainly have result­
ed from the collection of so much unspeakable offal and excrescence.
And here is still more important information which Advertising-
Writer Ezra didn’t know:
Average living creatures consume amounts of food equal to their
weight every ten weeks! Noah and his floating circus, riding the
world’s great typhoon, were afloat on the briny deep fifteen times ten
weeks. That meant that the whole zoo, humans included, required
to have aboard fifteen times their own physical weight and volume
of food to keep from starvation. We boys raised on the nations
farms once had plenty of muscular demonstration of the amount of
offal that accumulates when we neglected to clean out father s horse-
barn or cowbarn in the winter season, with livestock standing in their
stalls around the clock. I personally recall acting as masculine
chambermaid for three horses in my young and tender years. Al­
though those horses were regularly exercised in the open, the ac­
cumulation of manure outside the stable every month made almost
as large a cubic volume as the structure in which they were kept,
We are told there are at least 1,700 animal specimens in existence
today whose genealogical origins according to geology, antedate the
Hood. Try stabling 3,400 such animals, from elephants to chip­
munks, on the 26,230 square feet of floor space, or the three stories,
stipulated in Genesis, together with fifteen times their own bulk in
foodstuffs, and then come back to me and agree with me or not when
I maintain that Rabbi Ezra was the world’s greatest master of fiction.
No, the true facts lay nearer the circumstance that the Flood of
Noah was not universal, but more or less confined to some 300 feet
of water from the last water canopy that deluged the section of the
planet’s surface that included the Mediterranean basin. I am willing
to concede that there was a psychic person named Noah and that he
made a boat for the big rainstorm at the direction of clairaudient
mentorship. I am willing to concede that he and his relatives, with
food for them, might have remained cooped up in the famous scow
for six months without murdering one another or heaving one an­
other’s family pets out the 25-inch window. But I am inclined to
take the animal business with reservations. Noah might have taken
a certain number of his pet animals along, that the children mightn’t
have wanted to leave to drown. But even so, when it was over, and
he and Mrs. Noah realized the procreational work that lay before
them, I don’t blame the old gentleman for going on a first-class
drunk. In fact, I’m rather partial to Noah because he showed him­
self so human and not the prig which Ezra has made him out, at
all.
Whether Noah existed or not, is only important to “Cohen & Katz,*’
since it supplies them with a genealogical alibi for being in existence
at present to the commercial discomfort of a whole lot of Gentiles.
People existed in other parts of the world who did not take that Im­
mortal Boat Ride; and they kept and maintained certain social and
religious customs which Ezra hadn’t been told about.
Suppose we see what these customs were, and the parts played in
them by the various pyramids, in our succeeding lecture. . . .
