HE. G R E A T E S T catastrophe of m ortal tim es
w ith in our solar system w as, beyond chal­
len g e, th e collision of the tw in planets Quain
and H abal. T h e m ajor catastrophe to our
particular globe, how ever, w as not this “fall
of L u cifer,“ notw ithstanding its far-reaching
effects upon the Earth, but the wholesale de­
struction of the vast M other Continent of
A tlantis. T h e D eluge of the Bible drops into
a place third in importance compared with
these tw o cataclysm s. W hether the three
were all phases of one cataclysm ic sequence, whether one was con­
tingent upon the other, or whether long periods of time elapsed be­
tween them, is the special research to which our attention is now called.
Certain it is, that the effects of all three have been more or less con­
tused and welded, in considering their influence on present-day
learning and our heritage of culture.
Looking in retrospect at the events of history is?4ike looking in retro­
spect at the trees o f a forest. W hile w e are in^the forest, or upon the
edge of it, w e see the individual trees com posing it; each has char­
acter, or m arks our journeyings over its area. But the m om ent the
forest has b een le ft behind, the individual trees begin to blend into the
forest landscape as a w hole. Soon no one tree is distinguishable. W e
see the b ow ered area as a totality. W e think of it as having person­
ality, like W indsor Forest, or the Black Forest of Bavaria.
Glancing backw ard at great events which came to pass upon this earth,
we lu n i them into sequences. A ll that w ent before the rise and fall
of mighty Egypt is badly jumbled into folklore. All the incide
which ensued after the departure of the Children of Israel into Canaa*
are fused together upon another page of history; only the erudite
remember that almost as much time elapsed between the Exodus and
the birth of the Savior, as has elapsed since the Star rose over Bethle-
hem. Undoubtedly a thousand years hence, in considering American
history, Washington, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt will be con-
sidered as having lived and functioned in the same period and practi­
cally as contemporaries.
Humanity cannot be censured for this. There is no reason why it
should be censured. There are few ways in which chronology canbe
read correctly over vast periods of time, as written history alters in
language and terminology, or the materials or surfaces which have
recorded it crumble under the corrosion of centuries.
IBLE history divides past world-life into three great
periods: First, that between Eden and the Flood; Second,
that between the Flood and the coming of the Messiah;
Third, events attendant on or following the Messiahs
spiritual ministry. Strictly speaking, the Biblical ac­
counts of all three are little more than folklore. They
have no more tangibility of evidence for their chronologies than Greek
mythology. The Hebrews of Israel declare that they have kept true
records showing the generations from Adam down to Joseph the father
of Jesus. Their contention is absurd and fallacious. They did noth­
ing of the sort. For a thousand years Israel was a wandering, nomad
people. Wandering, nomad people do not keep records. Before the
Egyptian bondage there is no authentic record of them as being a
caste-conscious people at all, and therefore no reason existed why they
should keep such records. Not until the Levites, or Priest Clan, had
attained to such a degree of legalism that they could call themselves a
priesthood over a specific racial strain, did they begin to bethink them­
selves of a literature or of historical records. Finally, in the year
757 B. C., at Jerusalem, one Ezra, a High Priest, began a compilation
of all the Israelitish myths and folklore. He affected “
to get this in all
its purity from Moses. He made a great encyclopedia of the “sacred”
history of the Israelites, and it has come down to us with various altera­
tions from time to time, as the first half of our Old Testament. That
Ezra deliberately wrote the first half of the Old Testament, and doubt-

^ retations and cultures were, in our studies ot the evolution ot
legalism after the Exodus. Ezra seems to have been a great
Fjjte scholar who simply reached out and helped himself to what-
^ m
aterial he saw conveniently at hand. He compiled it between
*

ep
airof covers, and his work was later augmented by the equally
!r
a
ftyliteraryartisan Jeremiah, and blandly handed down to posterity
a
Sth
eofficial account of earth s peoples with the concurrence and en­
dorsement of the Hebrew God, Yahva, or as we get the word today,
jehovah, thus affecting to make it irrefutable. There is no more
cred
ib
leauthenticity behind it than there is credible authenticity behind
th
echronoogy of Greek mythology, 1 say. And as we proceed with
th
eselectures after the Egyptian period, 1 hope you will become con­
vin
cedthat my contention is correct in logic.
S
owecan no more depend on the Old Testament to give us a correct
agen a o umanity s affairs before the Deluge, than we can depend
o
nEgyptianor Mayan hieroglyphics or the stories of Greek and Roman
cm
igo s. ertain things happened in that pre-delugian period and
,° u * memory them alive. But folklore made a curious
ju
m e o time-episodes, exactly as though a grandmother told a child
t e 8ory of Abraham Lincoln one night, of George Washington the
nextnight, and of Christopher Columbus the third night—and the child
grew to manhood or womanhood insisting therefrom that George
Washington came after the time of Abraham Lincoln, and Christopher
Columbus after both. It is to history in other forms, geologically and
ethnologically, which embraces archaeology, that we must turn for the
plausible sorting out of this curious jumble of fact and myth.
It seems logical to accept that once upon a time the ill-fated but glori-
our Empire of Atlantis existed, with the headquarters of its culture in
theheart of a continent now sunken beneath the waves of the Atlantic.
For some reason or other it was destroyed. It seems logical to accept
that once upon a time too there was a heavenly holocaust, m which
nearby planets fused together and showered fire upon the earth. We
nearoy p „ , » . nre unon a time much of the earth s
can
expos
accept logically also that once upon a time much ot the earn
ed Und surface was submerged by stupendous flood. But m
just what order to place these three catastrophes, is a problem th
might better be left to other agencies than sacred history. hal
HEN the famous Babylonian tablets were dug up in and
around the site of ancient Ninevah, and upon translation
were found to attest the interstellar collision apostro­
phized in Isaiah, a Biblical record got a fairly authentic
attestment. But not the time elements involved. Insofar
as the Deluge is concerned, when Solon, the Greek his­
torian and scholar, visited Egypt, the priests of Sais said to him: “You
have no antiquity of history, and no history of antiquity. 0 Solon,
Solon, you Hellenes are but children, and there is never an old m
an
who is a Hellene. In mind you are all young. There is no old opinion
handed down among you by ancient tradition, nor any science which
is hoary with age. And we will tell you the reason for this. There
have been, and there will be again, many destructions of mankind
arising out of many causes. There is a story which even you have
preserved, that once upon a time Phaeton, the son of Helios, having
yoked the steeds in his father’s chariot, because he was not able to
drive them in the way of his father, burnt up all that was upon the
earth and was himself consumed by a thunderbolt. Now this has the
form of a myth, but really signifies a declension of the bodies moving
around the earth and in the heavens, and a great conflagration of
things upon the earth occurring at long intervals of time. When this
happens, those who live upon the mountains, or in dry and lofty places,
are more liable to destruction than those who dwell by rivers or upon
the seashore, and from this calamity the Nile, which is our never-
failing savior, saves and delivers us. When, on the other hand, the
gods purge the earth with a deluge of water, among you herdsmen
and shepherds of the mountains are the survivors, whereas those of
you who live in cities are carried by the rivers into the sea. But in this
country neither at that time nor at any other does the water come from
above on the fields, having always a tendency to come up from below,
for which reason the things preserved here are said to be the oldest.
The fact is, that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of summer
sun does not prevent, the human race is increasing at times, and at
other times diminishing in numbers. And whatever happened, either
in your country or in ours, or in any other region of which we are
informed— if any action which is noble or great, or in any other way
w
taken place— all that has been written down of old
.m
arkable, has ^ ^ ternpieS. Whereas you and other nations are
J isP
re8e^ idea with letters and other things which States require;
jljS
tbeingPr^ ugua| peri0(i the stream from heaven descends like a
^ lenc/and leaves only those of you who are destitute of letters
^education; and thus you have to begin all over again as children,
adknownothing of what happened in ancient times, either among us
ram
ongyourselves. As for those geologies of yours, which you have
recounted to us, Solon, they are no better than the tales of children,
fo
rinthe first place, you remember one deluge only, whereas there
w
eremany of them; and in the next place, you do not know that there
dw
eltin your land the fairest and noblest race of men that ever lived,
ofwhomyou and your city are but a seed or remnant. And this was
unknown to you, because for many generations the survivors of that
destructiondied and made no sign. For there was a time, Solon, before
th
egreatest deluge of all, when the city which now is Athens was first
inwar, and was preeminent for the excellence of her laws, and is said
tohaveperformed the noblest deeds, and to have had the fairest consti­
tutionof any of which tradition tells, under the face of heaven."
Solon marveled at this and earnestly requested the priests to inform
himexactly and in order about these former citizens. "You are wel­
come to hear about them, Solon," the priests replied, "both for your
own sake and for that of the city, and above all for the sake of the
goddess who is the common patron and protector of both our cities.
She founded your city a thousand years before ours, receiving from
the Earth and Hephaestus the seed of your race, and then she founded
ours, the constitution of which is set down in our sacred registers as
8,000 years old. As touching the citizens of 9,000 years ago, we will
briefly inform you of their laws and of the noblest of their actions, and
the exact particulars of the whole we will hereafter go through at our
leisure in the sacred registers themselves. If you compare these very
laws with vour own, you will find that many of them are the counter­
part of yours, as they were in the olden time.
7
E SH A L L go m ore exhaustively into the details of P
gian and A tlantean culture, as reported to Solon k
w e have straightened out this matter of the Quain-H k
catastrophe, which started the pyramid-building all o
the earth, and the time of the deluge episode which pe^
plexes so m any people in H oly Writ. The point to be
em phasized now is, as the priests of Sais reported to Solon, that the
world has seen m any major catastrophes, but modern humanity, hav­
ing no key to the cryptography of their dates, fuses and welds them
together but fails to distinguish at the same time the significance of
each upon human thinking and human customs.
Let us linger for a few moments, in elucidation of this, upon the
Quain-Habal catastrophe. Before it happened, humanity had always
conceived of the Deity as beneficent. After it happened, humanity
had been left with the psychological complex of a deity that could also
be wrathy and inflict unspeakable chastisement upon hapless peoples
of Earth. And that complex has come down through ten thousand
years of human thinking, until today it is quite as much a part of
theology as it was among the barbarians of western Atlantis or the Sun
Worshipers of Maya. Hebrew sacred literature, on which Christianity
is based, reeks with the horror of it. It works introvertly, and we have
the solemn assurance of mystics that even Atlantis perished because of
her decadence and wickedness, from the vengeance of Deity. Hun­
dreds of thousands believe this, just as hundreds of millions believe in
a Christian God who once played partners with the Israelites and be­
stowed favors on them which worked much damage to other races that
He had created. Ten thousand church spires still attest the type of
God who delights in the smell of burning entrails, and who thoroughly
approves of the vicarious-atonement scapegoat ideology to set every­
thing right for the “sins” of “Adam.” The animal nature in man
abets this. His physical weakness lends a timidity to his spirit that
grovels before such a piece of venal blasphemy. And he builds his
entire culture on the assumption that if such a thing happened once, it
can easily happen again. Even the Beloved and Gentle Jesus of Galilee
is ultimately to return to this earth in a chariot of fire, accompanied by
earthquake and universal doom, heralded by panic-making angels.
Here is symbology raised to the nth degree of superstitious barbarism.
And it all goes back, back, to a racial fear complex caused by an inter­
stellar catastrophe, and capitalized by a voracious priestcraft for tighter
8
, 0V
er the destinies of men for their own advantage Persian
trianism, with its utilization of the Ahriman-Devil idea, is
upon the old Baal concept of the Avatar-Ruler deliverer, and
^ pernicious fright complex called Religion has made cravens and
i n s down a thousand generations.
S
jjgtrue scholar who knows his prehistoric history, sees in all this
a
ught but the effects of a solar catastrophe, or perhaps several solar
catastrophes, which, rightfully understood in an age of astronomical
en
lightenment, would completely alter the character and ministry of
Galilean. But the priests and theologians of today seem to be
quite as voracious for power in sacred matters, and quite as venal
opportunists in capitalizing on humanity’s planetary misfortunes, as
ever they were in the days of Atlantean Baalism or Sun Worship.
Having lost their true psychic powers and transcendental talents, the
capitalization of such racial fear complexes is all that is left to them
tomaintain their grasp upon the masses. Otherwise they would be
ignored. Humanity would discover that it is quite possible for each
m
an and woman to be his or her own priest, since communion with
The Almighty Father is strictly a personal matter with the human
soul, abundantly attested and preached by Jesus.
Jesus came striving to clean up these ugly old precepts and concepts,
andthe irony of His ministry has been that instead of metamorphosing
the fear complex or graduating the sons of men out of it, the thelogians
played the despicable trick of adding Him and His precepts and con­
cepts to it, and made one grand superstitious hodge-podge of the whole.
Small wonder that the agnostic is entirely confused and not a little
cynical. The wonder is, that all religious students, and indeed all re­
ligionists of any stamp, are not professional cynics.

O W little was known or suspected, that the Divine D

at all, until almost down into our own generation. Th"
one Denton, state geologist of New Hampshire, whow
a
also an amateur astronomer of some distinction, puk
lished a book called “The Soul of Things.”
Mr. Denton had dwelt long and studiously over the question of that
vast empty space between Mars and Jupiter, which by the dictates of
Bode*s Law should contain its major planet. When and as the
Planetoids came to be discovered, it occurred to Denton that these little
groups of eccentric vagabond planets might well be the remnants ofa
once mighty planet that Isaiah designated as Lucifer. He began to
experiment to prove the truth of his hypothesis, by utilizing a psy­
chometric boy. Let me digress a moment here to explain exactly what
is meant by a psychometric boy in this connection. It does not neces­
sarily mean a person sensitive at reading Vibrations that constitute the
essence of things. The subject with whom Mr. Denton worked might
better be termed a “cataleptic psychometrist.”
Now we are discovering in metaphysics some strange properties in the
human ensemble which materialistic scientists will not admit as yet
because those properties are by nature esoteric. We who are esoteric
students as well as scholars of materialistic things, not recognizing any
essential difference between the two, but eager only to get at Truth,
can easily follow Mr. Denton in his experiments not only with sym­
pathy but with understanding.
Let me illustrate what Mr. Denton did, and what I myself have done,
by describing an incident which occurred in Belgium back at the turn
of the century. Two metaphysicians were extremely puzzled by feats
which were being performed before their eyes by a young man who
succumbed easily to cataleptic hynopsis. Whenever they hypnotized
this young man and asked him what was happening at a distant place,
invariably on coming from his trance he was able to tell them. He
could find lost articles with ease. He could give them a knowledge of
gatherings and sayings of friends of the moment who might be
separated from them by thousands of miles of water. Was there really
no such thing as time or space, they wondered, to the higher faculties?
Finally they hit upon the expedient of attempting to photograph the
young man before, during, and after hypnosis, to learn whether the
, anything remarkable about his behavior which
would P>«upThi v performed this photography with a quartz

experim

uc t mgs are actualities, and can no more be laughed aside because
6 k°r|na eye cann°t behold them, than the fact of the human aura
can be laughed aside because the ordinary eye is too clumsy to pick it
up in daylight, or that radio waves exist notwithstanding the normal
ear cannot hear them. Not only can people be sent out of their bodies
at will, without physical death’s resulting, but there are persons who
can detach themselves and go out at will, travel with the speed of light
to a given spot, observe what is passing there, and come back and
reoccupy their bodies, without anyone s suspecting what has happened.
1say in no spirit of conceit, but as the submission of an interesting
academic fact that does not become a part of my thinking from hear­
say that under certain conditions I can perform this feat myself and
say, tnar uave ha<J my friends confirm that my physical body
have done so, t^em in one place while an identical manifests-

p° jn a Light Body was occurring at another, fully attested
by recognition in the second place as well as the first. Manv
can truthfully recount similar experiences, and attest that iP

speak necromantically. 0 not
It was with such a person that Denton made his now-famous experi
ments. But he did not merely send his subject’s Light Body, contain
ing a phase of his consciousness, to another spot upon the earth’s sur­
face. He proceeded to send it out into interstellar space to witness the
astral record of what may have occurred tens of thousands of years in
the past, on the principle that vibrations of such episodes, once set in
movement do not perish but may be observed if the recording ma­
chinery is sufficiently delicate.
Denton found this boy bringing back reports of a terrific collision in
the heavens, with a fragment of the colliding bodies plunging into the
earth’s sphere of influence and being drawn at a frightful speed to its
surface. He had full corroboration from this cataleptic boy, of what
he suspected as a sound astronomer. Bear in mind that this occurred
before the famous tablets were discovered near the site of ancient
Ninevah confirming both experiments and hypothesis.
These tablets, when translated, even gave names to the twin planets as
they were known and witnessed in the sky at the time of the Chaldean
astronomical observations. From the same ancient record came the
names of the fratricidal brothers in Genesis, as well as the myths of the
fratricidal brothers all down through history: Castor and Pollux,
Romulus and Remus, et al. The Babylonian tablets declared that
once between Mars and Jupiter were the twin planets Quain and
Habal, revolving around each other and forming the bright morning
star which is recognized in sacred terminology as Lucifer. When the
ancients observed the collision and suffered the approach and impact
of the vast molten fragment, which struck Earth as per the narrative
in our foregoing lecture, they at once seized upon the notion of a
“war in heaven” and the “casting forth” of rebellious spirits. Michael
was supposed to “fight the Dragon,” because in hurtling through space
in elongated form, the fragment had the aspect of a gigantic fiery
snake. A titanic piece of astronomical symbology comes to us as the
very cornerstone of modern theology, for challenging which, heretics
or agnostics are still pilloried or burned at the stake, figuratively if not
literally. The Denton book, “The Soul of Things,” has long been out
of print and is extremely difficult to procure. But all of the geologist’s
psychometric findings were confirmed and corroborated by archae-

URIOUS to find out for my own first-hand information
whether the Denton experiments were bona fide and
could be repeated, I engaged with a profound scholar
and metaphysician to perform some experiments with a
sensitized young man of our acquaintance who was
cheerfully willing to be sent, either out of his body into
interstellar space, or back into the recesses of his prenatal memory.
T
h
isthing took place before my eyes and ears in my office in Wash­
ington, U. L., on the 14th of April, 1932__
U
sing a simple form of mesmerism first made a scientific study by
Keichenbach, the young man was sent back some fifteen or twenty
previous earthly lives to witness an episode in which he participated
mancient Luzco, in Central America, some twelve thousand years
ago. hue he was deep, deep in the recesses of his Eternal Mind,
witnessing in actual visual memory the events of the particular episode
whichhad to do with a grisly sun sacrifice, the eminent doctor who was
performing the experiment turned to me and remarked: '‘Now I’m
going to bring him back, detach him from his body and propel him
dut into interstellar space. W e’ll see if he can witness what the
Denton boy saw.”
The proper suggestion performed this feat. The amazing part of the
experiment was, that while absent from his body, nevertheless a sym­
pathetic life-cord still connected his spirit with his physical ensemble
to such a degree that what he was witnessing in the discarnate state
registered in his facial expression as he sat before us. We saw all the
reactions of wonder, horror, fear, and awe, upon his features. Finally,
after twenty minutes, he was gently recalled and restored to mortal
consciousness. For several moments after his arousing, he sat weak
anil stunned, scarcely comprehending that he was back m the earth-
state in the year »932. Then he began this recital-

be a mild term by which to label it. From time to time I seem
dart consciously through various stratospheres, when worlds beca ^
visible to me as they are visible out under the starlit skies of the earth
at present. Then I arrived in an area where a grotesque and unspeak­
ably awesome thing was in progress. Stupendous Thought-Forms
best described as products of the Almighty's Brain, were rolling and
fashioning before my gaze. I saw Thought seeming to galvanize
primordial ether and spin it at an amazing acceleration. Faster and
faster it whirled, growing brilliant as a vast spiral nebula, till the eye
of my mind could no longer look into it. I seemed to recede where
the heat and noise were not so tormenting.
“Next, I saw that great nebula wobble in two great cores, each at­
tached to the other by fiery primordial stuffs that progressively
gathered into vortexes. Presently they were separate and distinct but
flying in a mammoth orbit around each other like the balls on the end
of a chain, in an ancient cross-bolt shot. Gradually this orbit widened
between them. Their fields of progress became fixed and rhythmical.
Two planets were there in space before my gaze, perfect in contour,
spinning with immense heat and brilliance, each equal distance from
the other, yet chasing each other around a circular orbit, and the two
as one unit flying in an orbit around a mightier centrosome, which
must have been our sun. Then came the collision. What caused it?
I’ll tell you what seemed to cause it!
“A third planet began to take form, by exactly the same process which
I have described, and gather speed, brilliance, and gravitational pu I,
between it and Mars. Presently its whirl was powerful enough to
exert an influence on the twin planets I had seen manufactured out o

say, at the present stage of our enlightenment? He had
never read anything of which we were aware, concerning
the Quain-Habal catastrophe. He was an entirely normal
young man who worked in my office. Sending him back

e s a -Acre coincides accurately with the condition which
as ronomers and scientists believe to exist in the asteroid belt outside
or our stratosphere. His periodic flashes of perception, of visible
wor ds and chaotic darkness, would bear out the hypothesis that in
Space the heavenly bodies are only visible as their light is refracted by
the stratosphere of neighboring planets.
But just where did the young man go ? He was in deep cataleptic
trance before our gaze for a matter of twenty minutes. Yet he de­
scribed happenings that must have required millenniums of our earthly
time to mature and take place. It is not enough to declare that outside
of our mortal world there is no such thing as Time or Space. That
young man by catalepsy had his perceptions sensitized to such a pitch
that he apparently negated time. That, or he read, through eye wit­
nessing the akashic vibratory records, on the astral plane, of the actual
occurrences as they performed ages upon ages in the past,

of m omentous occurrence in the past. When we get out of three-
dimensional sense inhibitions, we behold all the universe, not only as
it always has been but as it yet will be, in its various manifestations of
planetary phenomena. W e are told that we as mortals are coming
to inventions shortly which shall recapture such spectacles visibly and
render them intelligent to mortal eyes. We shall see the sun, the
moon, and the stars, as they were in abysmal cosmos and how they
propelled themselves out into three-dimensional reality. It is not to
solve an equation in fourth-dimensional physics that 1 have intro­
duced this episode into the present lecture, but to call your attention
to an item quite consistent with our theme.
Remember that our young man reported that “a third planet seemed
to form in interstellar space, which pulled Quain and Habal off their
orbits.*’ That is terribly significant. For it tends to bind in the esoteric
with the practically materialistic. Why did that third planet form?
W hat caused it to form, knowing in advance that such terrible denoue­
ment might be the celestial penalty?
Could it have become an actuality, even in its archaic state, from the
wrong thinking of persons in an earthly tenure, engaging in unhal­
lowed mental practices?
Let us consider this awesome aspect of things for a moment. The
theme of our lecture is “Why Atlantis Was Allowed to Perish,
submit to you that it is faintly possible that Atlantis was not “allowed
to perish at all. I submit to you that we may be confronted here with
the cataclysmic fact that perhaps degenerate human thinking, perni­
ciously conceiving, may even now set vast Thought Forms in motion
out in abysmal Cosmos, equally as devastating in their effects on other
planets as wrong thinking on the part of individuals may be disastrous
on other individuals; and that thus a force was unleashed in ether, in
the form of the Quain-Habal collision, that made the earth-world at­
tract its own perishment.
Do not make light of this thesis until we know more about the mighty
functions of the human mind. Let us see what Holy Writ tells us of
conditions preceding the Deluge of Noah. I beg to inflict on you what
may seem for the moment a commonplace reading. But viewed from
a slightly different perspective, in the light of these new doctrines, it
may not be so commonplace as we have hitherto consideded it.
In the sixth chapter of Genesis, we find these pronouncements:
16
“And it cam e to pass, w h en m en began to m ultiply on the face of the
*arth, and daughters w ere born unto them, that the Sons of God saw
the daughters o f m en that they w ere fair; and they took them wives
of all which they chose.
“And the Lord1said, m y Spirit shall not always strive with man, for
that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
“There w ere giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
when the sons of G od cam e in unto the daughters of men, and they
bare children to them , the sam e became mighty men which were of
old, men of renow n.
“And G od saw that the w ickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every im agination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil con­
tinually. A nd it repented the Lord that He had made man on the earth,
and it grieved H im at H is heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man
whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast,
and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air: for it repenteth me
that I have m ade them .
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
These are the generations of N oah: Noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations, and Noah walked with God. And Noah begat three
sons, Shem , Ham , and Japheth.
The earth also w as corrupt before G od; and the earth was filled with
violence. A nd God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was cor­
rupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God
said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth
is filled w ith violence through them ; and' behold, I will destroy them
w ith the earth.*’
R ight here, with this Biblical account before us, I want to be allowed to
depart from the strictly scientific and historical, and justify the esoteric
as having a more important bearing of explanation upon our minds
in logic, than that which man exhibits as the true cause for Divine
anger at man.
17
E A R E told in no uncertain terms that “the Mrtk
corrupt. but just what can be meant by “corruption”
in this instance? In the ordinary acceptance of the term
men have been morally corrupt in every age, especially
are they morally corrupt today; yet nothing of a cata­
clysmic nature happens to them, except the corrupt be
mingled with and suffer with the non-corrupt.
W e must turn to the marvelous revealments of our Liberation Scripts,
and learn of m an’s true progress on this earth through the aeons. To
understand the full import of Genesis, we must have reference to the
Atlantean knowledge, lost of old, as to why men came to this earth,
and what they did after getting here that has perpetually wrought
w oes of a natural order upon them.
W e have seen in earlier lectures in this series, that man originally came
here in spiritual form and found an earth that was soft and moist under
a great water veil or canopy, the actual Garden of Eden in tropical
form, where he went naked until precipitation of the various water
rings gradually introduced him to outer, planetary cold. Whereupon
he “w ent forth” from the Edenic condition, and “multiplied” over the
face of the globe, until most all of the water canopy was down and he
saw the clear heavens and the naked sun.
V ery good. But as he came to multiply throughout the earth, and
increase in spiritual stature, it seemed the divine plan that avatar in­
dividuals or entities should come to him from other dimensions of
Cosmos and teach and train him in the exigencies of his new condition.
A ll through H oly Writ and holy utterance, we find perpetual reference
to them as the Sons of God, as contradistinguished from the sons of
men who were in the earth state learning the great lessons of ex-
perience. X* 2!*
N ow it seems to have been the plan of things that these divine spirits
of a higher order of intelligence and spiritual essence and develop­
ment, should incarnate among men in the mortal form in order to work
and m ove among mankind without causing friction due to superhuman
attainments. That is to say, if these superior teachers had adopted
any other form than the mortal, they would quickly have bred an­
tagonism. Men would have feared them instead of loving and
mingling with them on a friendly person-to-person basis. They would
have been an order of creation outside mortal comprehension or
capacity to appreciate. They would have had to function as a race or

is being so, it follow ed that the earthly sons so born had the impetus
within them, veritably a part of their cellular lives, to approximate
their quasi-divine sires w hile resting physically in the sensuous endow­
ments of earth-born and inhibited mothers. W hat was not foreseen
was, that these divine-earthly spirits thus inhabiting earthly bodies
should come to the curious paradox of using their divine gifts intro-
vertly or to the sense extrem es of their mothers yet with all the terrific
potencies of their fathers* projections of spirit.

ing, that might have utterly reprehensible consequences for the worU
at large. ±jr a
W e know that the spirits of those same avatars and mortals are today
still both functioning side by side. But the mortals have begun to put
on immortality, as it were, and create a species or caste for themselves
that is far, far ahead of the man-beast mothers, in the direction of the
divine avatar-fathers. And the result is what we know as civilization.
Atlantis came to her prime under the mentoring and spiritual ruler-
ship of these avatar “Sons of God” from a higher dimension. The
country knew them and prospered for generations under the purity of
their kingship. But the offspring of such unions where the mothers
were, strictly speaking, mortal in the fullest sense of the word, ex­
hibited a strange inheritance. Secure in the possession of certain
psychical equipment derived biologically from avatar-fathers, and yet
hobbled and inhibited in the true utility of these attributes by the
dictates of mortal mothers, backward in spiritual development because
of their lower “spiritual species,” they gave an appalling display of
what the so-called Love Force can do when wrongly directed.
It is an astounding fact, all too frequently encountered in the study of
heredity, that when high-caste men and women marry beneath them
the offspring tend to “take after” the more stupid or retrograde of the
parents. Seldom indeed do scientists find that the more advanced
partner to the marriage lifts the backward partner into his or her own
quality of consciousness, because quality of consciousness is not a
matter of either inspiration or mentorship; it is a matter of enhanced
self-awareness through long periods of experiencing. It cannot be
bestowed by another person. Invariably the more laggardly partner
drags the other back down to his own mental or cultural level, or the
marriage goes “on the rocks” and the more advanced partner seeks his
own blood and kind. The children of such unions “take after” the
mothers in greater ratio than after the fathers. There are several
notable instances where offspring of high-caste fathers and moronistic
mothers have been studied, the John Wentworth case being the most
celebrated. The percentage of morons among such progeny is well-
nigh incredible. All of the good qualities and high breeding in the
more advanced parent seem to go negative and introvert, as though
Nature herself frowned on such retrograde misalliances.
From the esoteric standpoint, and because we understand something
of the processes constantly going on behind life which the scientist
20
ores or discredits, it is highly probable that the greater percentage
backward souls seek such parentage in order to get into life with
the chance of earthly culture through such sires, and yet “on the
mother’s vibration” on which they are operating cosmically them­
selves. Or retrograde souls may take such opportunity to ‘‘slash
back” at the spiritually developed father by forcing themselves into an
earthly situation where they can fret or discredit him. At any rate,
we know that marrying out of caste, which is marrying out of Quality
of Consciousness derived from cycles of experiencing, rarely results
in happiness or longevity of matrimony. And in the Atlantean culture
we apparently have an exhibit of this on a wholesale scale.
The interested student may well inject the question here: ‘‘How is
the human stock ever to be improved, if the better is not occasionally
‘crossed’ with the more delinquent in health or culture?” The answer is,
human improvement does not derive from cross-breeding of that char­
acter at all. To put it in exaggerated form, no breeder of any species is
so foolish as to cross a healthy animal with a sick animal, or a deformed
animal, thinking to get two or more healthy animals in result. He
knows that he does not cure the sick one by such infusion of blood, but
merely taints the one that is well and lusty. If the intelligent breeder
wants to improve any stock, he continues to breed the strong with the
strong, the best exhibits of each species together. And the offspring
continues to improve. In the human relationship we too often get
confused in these matters because we place a false or merely ethical
valuation on what constitutes ‘‘blue blood.” A blood may be
utterly decadent in the eyes of the human biologist and yet be classed
as “blue” and “aristocratic” by society. A lusty peasant girl may have
finer spiritual and physical qualities than the most revered *noble­
m an,” and in the case of such an alliance the “taint situation is re­
versed, and the offspring will probably evince all of the decadent traits
in the father’s character. Standing among men counts for very little;
Quality of Consciousness is everything.
To put the case of the Atlantean decadence before you in graphic and
accentuated form, consider what might have happened had Jesus mar­
ried some Galilean fishwife. Possessed of all the stupendous avatar
potencies derived from the super-father, yet exhibiting in the inhibited
physical and cultured mechanism bestowed by the gross mortal mother,
the progeny might have been frightful to contemplate in their powers
for good or evil— probably for evil. The world too little recognizes
this same principle often at work in it today. We lament that mar­
riages between great artists, great poets, great spiritual instructors,
great ethical leaders, and commonplace partners, seem consistently to
go astray. W e who are enlightened in such matters know that great
artists, great poets, great teachers, are uniformly of the avatar caste
of old, come into flesh to inspire the human race to achieve in its own
right. Where they cross themselves physically with entirely mortal
women, they soon find such unions intolerable and the break arrives
inexorably. What truly is happening is, that two separate species are
being crossed, and the result is disaster because a celestial law is being
violated. The two are operating on entirely different cosmic vibra­
tions. True, they both exhibit in the same type of outward physical
form. But the one class of partners might be termed spiritual mentors
or divine teachers come down into flesh, whereas the other class may
be little better than beasts come up into flesh.
S W E seem to have gone esoteric in this present lecture,
we might well declare that it was no “wrath of God/’in
the literal sense, that precipitated the destruction of At­
lantis, for God is above all such handicaps and inhibi­
tions, or disruptions of poise. True, the results of vio­
lating certain natural laws of celestial heredity might well
be termed “God’s Wrath,” but we should begin to recognize the blas­
phemy in such an assumption as the theologian presents it to us. W
e
should rather concern ourselves with the circumstance that the de­
cadence of Atlantis came about because the celestial potentiality inthe
mortal species manifested wrongly en masse, and in a manner of
speaking overtaxed the mortal mechanisms and went its own way
toward the precipitation of vast destruction.
In other words, Atlantis in the days of her decadence destroyed her­
self, by projecting Thought Forms of mighty malevolence into Cosmos
and making it impracticable for such a “civilization” to endure, either
as a culture or as a manifested race occupying a planetary allocation.
Species had been so corrupted by incorrect crossbreeding that monsters
were overrunning society in forms beyond our ability to contemplate.
I suggest in connection with this lecture that you read carefully again
the First to the Fifth of the esoteric Liberation Psychical Scripts.
Atlantis was more than a place, more than a mere continent spanning
the area now covered by the Atlantic. Atlantis was a Divine Idea
22
ected am ong ev o lv in g m ankind in the form of a social state where
9r°]
n should live as A lm ig h ty Providence originally intended m en to
.yg after they had passed through the fires of social experiencing and
jarned to recognize the true ethical culture from the false. But after
ontold generations, the tim e arrived w hen the Force that was divine
rquasi-divine incarnated in the fathers, crossed with the inhibited or
inadequate m ortal in the m others, and found itself at a point where
progress w as neither norm al nor desirable to either in terms of its ow n
satisfactions. T h e m ortal had planetary limitations. The divine was
limitless. So the tw o natures, or conditions, grew increasingly at odds.
And the m ortal “held down** the divine or perverted it into practices
which becam e divinity gone negative or introvert— a phenom enon
we witness all about us even in the present in the psychical accom ­
plishments w hich w e label Black Magic.
The result w as increasing chaos and malformation of creation. It was
the spiritually celestial running berserk into a morass of carnality. The
mighty precepts o f divinity were watered or lost in the fleshly accom­
plishments o f creating that which had no constructive, loving purpose
behind it. A nd not having such, the alternative was the negative
exhibit, D estruction.
We confront here a m ighty m ystery as to w hy this should be so, or
why the w hole program of prostitution should not have been foreseen
in the first place. In a manner of speaking it was known in advance.
Yet it had to be gone through with as a gesture in indolence on the
part of the evolving mortal, a phase of his evolution, in order to bring
him the true grasp of the potentialities of his divine inheritance, toward
possession of w hich in the correct manifestation he was battling his
way upward through the aeons. The alternative was annihilation of
the spiritual species, or a self-awareness that would ever have remained
static----som ething abhorred in celestial or spiritual physics as the
vacuum is abhorred in natural physics.
A s for A tlantis, there came a time when she had to be taken aw ay
from the earth schem e as a culture, even as she was obliterated as a
place. The man-species, considered spiritually, had to function w ithin
the bounds of its ow n orthodoxy, so to speak, and learn from a painful
climb to celestiality of thought processes and behavior, w hat m ight
be called, from the earthly viewpoint, Ethical Perfection.
The decadence of Atlantis, if w e wish to term it that, w as in reality the
prostitution of divine gifts, attributes, and endowm ents, received from
a line of avatar sires, to the strictly material concernments of flesh and
the enhancem ent of temporal prospects for the individual. To what
extent that prostitution progressed w e shall consider in our next lec­
ture, “W hy the Atlanteans Migrated to Egypt/* It was not unlike the
very trend that seem s so obvious in society today— the application of
divine powers of logic and invention to purposes of individual ag­
grandizement or species destruction— only on a far less dangerous
scale today due to the fact that there is at present a great preponderance
of persons alive from that Long A go A ge, who have learned the great
lesson of divine futility in the strictly earthly exhibit. They are here
in fleshly form, yes, but with a deeper sense of understanding. If it
were not so, if Am erica did not contain so many of them, America
would soon becom e a shambles.
There was more than an esoteric lesson in the destruction of Atlantis,
as is seen in the circumstance that the Powers Behind Cosmos deter­
mined that the earth species should be denied the centripetal form of
culture in the Hub, that it might apply its lessons in actuality on the
world-wheel's rim in those isolated colonies that after countless gener­
ations became the m ighty nations of the present.
Be that as it may, Atlantis underwent a great Upward Progress in
culture under the kingly tutelage of its Avatar-Fathers and its mighty
mothers— for make no mistake, the goddesses of the Greeks were the
mythical apostrophes of great wom en quite as much as the gods of
ancient m ythology again and again are the prototypes of great spiritual
avatars whose identities are never recognized and too seldom assumed.
f| I have digressed from the materialistically historical in this lecture
in order that w e might tie up in our thinking, certain earthly events of
great magnitude with the celestial principles of esoteric doctrine behind
them. ±gf
W e are proving in metaphysics that human thinking is an Originating
and Creating Force. Is it so preposterous to contend that massed
Atlantean thinking, perversively expended, could have started up great
influences in Cosmos that precipitated the giant catastrophes which
wrought literal destruction of the nationals responsible?
Let us, who are ploughing a furrow and planting seed, seize upon all
the evidence w e can, even as far back as primordial history, that may
enlighten the advanced thinkers of our own generation and galvanize
them into exploring and codifying that which now may seem merely
conjectural and abstruse.
