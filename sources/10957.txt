  		              		Experience Description   

    Four days before my 16th birthday, we had our walls painted in our family house. In the bathroom, the workers removed the pipe which drains out carbon monoxide  from water heater  to the chimney. They didn't warn us about it. I went into bathroom to wash my hair. After some time, I got very dizzy. I grabbed onto the corner of the bathtub and turned off the water. 

  After that, I lost consciousness. The next thing I remember is that I found myself in the long tunnel through which I was moving forward.  I wasn't walking because I didn't have the body. I began to realize that I was dying. I didn't want to die. Then I began fighting with all I had to get back to life. That's when the long battle between death and me began. I was struggling  so hard to pull onto one side, and death was pulling to another. I just didn't allow it to pull me away. I had so much strength and I was extraordinarily powerful, which totally surprised me at that point. I kept wondering where do I get all that strength from since I always had very weak hands. To me, that fight looked like pulling a rope with a flag in the middle. I pulled to one side, death pulled to the other.  The flag moved back and forth. It lasted for  some time but I had amazing strength and didn't want to let it go. In one moment everything stopped. Then the bright light appeared in front of me and asked 'Marina, are you ready to die?' I said, 'No, no. I'm only 16 years old and I still haven't done anything good." Then I felt that I was going back to life. Death gave up on me.   

  I don't know at which point I started to gain consciousness. I've saw three men trying to take my clothes off. I didn't know what happened so I thought they came into my house and want to rape me. That was actually the medical staff. I fought them as well and held my panties tight so they can't take them off. I felt a stab on my finger. I was shocked because the whole time I thought those were the men trying to rape me and now they're stabbing me too. Then the nurse slapped me to stop me from preventing them to help me. I cried out of horror of what they're doing to me. Then I heard nurse saying to doctor not to take my panties because she noticed I had a hygiene pad since I had a period. After she slapped me, I began to cry and the nurse was comforting me, stroking my head. I think that all of this and occasional wakening happened after my experience.
