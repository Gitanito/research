This is a 5 year prospective   Welsh study out of the UK to explore if anoxia, hypercarbia or drug   administration could explain the NDE.&nbsp; Key points in the study were:

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apparent that   NDEs are not wishful thinking as some experiences did not meet the expectations   of the patient and two NDEs were unpleasant.&nbsp; This is consistent with NDERF   research findings.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the NDE group   and those who did not die but who experienced an OBE, Dr. Sabam's study was   repeated where the two groups were asked to re-enact their resuscitation.&nbsp; The   OBErs were very inaccurate and demonstrated misconceptions and errors between   the actual procedures performed, as well as equipment used.&nbsp; The NDErs were   significantly more accurate.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is likely that the   NDE is an under-reported phenomenon.&nbsp; Only two NDEs were spontaneously reported   to members of staff.&nbsp; The remaining thirteen NDEs would not have been disclosed   had the patients not been interviewed.&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the population   were given painkilling and sedative dr ugs.&nbsp; The conclusion was that if drugs     were the cause of the  NDE  then a larger percentage of NDEs would be expected.&nbsp; There       were cases who reported &quot;similar to NDEs became they became very confused once       painkilling drugs had been administered.&quot; This statement assumes that because       the person did not remember the      NDE while impaired by drugs that it       the NDE wasn't real.&nbsp; While this finding may show that drugs interfere with the       immediate memory of the NDE, this study does not address whether the NDE was     remembered after the person was no longer under the influence of drugs.&nbsp;

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All but one patient     who reported hallucinations had been given a combination of large amounts of     sedative and painkilling drugs.&nbsp; The NDEs followed a pattern, yet the     &quot;hallucinations were very random, bizarre and related to actual occurrences and     the actions of members of staff.&nbsp; On follow-up, those who had reported     hallucinations could rationalize that they had been hallucinating, whereas NDErs   remained adamant that their experience was real.&quot;

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases in which blood   was extracted at the time of the NDE / OBE did not support the anoxia or   hypercarbia theories.

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Further unexplained   aspects of the NDE, such as meeting deceased relatives who were not known to be   dead at the time of the experience and gaining information in ways other than   through the senses, could not be explained by physiological or psychological   factors.&quot;   The   conclusion of the study is that the NDE phenomenon remains &quot;unexplained when   considered from the current scientific perspective of consciousness being a   by-product of neurological processes. The fact that clear, lucid experiences   were reported during a time when the brain was devoid of activity (Aminoff et   al., 1988, Clute and Levy 1990, de Vries et al., 1998), does not sit easily with   current scientific belief.&quot;
