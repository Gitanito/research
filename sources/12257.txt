Then I walked up the stairs to a huge Greek building that looks JUST like the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. I went inside and saw the beautiful, white marble flooring. I went down a long hallway and there was a room with thousands of scrolls. I pulled one out to read it. It was writing that I've never seen before. Then the writing disappeared in front of me. I then looked over my shoulder and there was a man standing in the doorway with a stern look on his face. I got scared and took off running. That's the last thing I remember. I woke up in the hospital in a lot of pain.  I was being zapped with a defibrillator.  It really hurts!
