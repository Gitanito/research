THE NEW WORLD
MECHANICAL SYSTEM
INTRODUCTION.
My "Paradise," &c. surveys the great materials of the world,
and shows the powers and means, in general, to make .1 paradise,
not of superstitious and childish fancy, but of intelligence, and all
the enjoyments that the present world affords to man, as far as the
knowledge of the present age teaches, and as the most informed and
enlightened men of the present day would wish.
The present book, as a sequel of my " Paradise," gives the details
of a mechanical system, actuated by powers demonstrated in that
book, to produce a terrestrial paradise of abundance without labour
of either man or beast. /
1 prove here minutely what 1 have proved in general in my
" Paradise," by experience known to every one.
To accommodate the dullest and laziest mind, 1 accompany this
with plates of the machinery, of which every part is tested by prac-
tice, and give all the explanations and calculations required ; and
tender, in addition, models for inspection of the same system.
I offer contracts for the execution of the whole or any part thereof,
on easy terms, say ten per cent, of the profit, or some equivalent.
The things I offer here to you, are, in short, these, viz.
Powers that are much stronger than all the men and beasts to-
gether you are able to muster, and as strong as you wish them, most
obedient to your will, imperishable, indefatigable, working for you
day and night, for ever, without food or wages, and which, with a
few simple tools, cultivate all your land, build your houses, make
all your desirable canals and roads, and carry you and your things
from place to place as quickly as you please, and ultimately change
your country—your unproductive woods and prairies, your dismai
swamps and ponds, your mountains and vallies, and your poorly
cultivated farms—into a general paradise.
1*
4 INTRODUCTION.
These powers and tools will perform all the labours much better
than either human hands or beasts could ever do.
They will make large reservoirs, in the most convenient places,
for the double purpose of tilling, by the power of water- falls, and of
irrigating the soil around each to the distance of miles. They will
clear your ground from trees, stumps, roots and rocks, and prepare
the land for the finest garden culture. They will cut out of the
ground rocks in rectangular shapes, and fit them for pavements and
buildings, without cement, and erect houses or lay pavemei
them. They will make any excavation, elevation or applanation of
the ground, such, for instance, as canals, roads, wells, mines, dams,
fill swamps and ponds and drain them to make a fertile garden of
them, confine waters into narrower appropriate channels, make them
navigable where wanted, and render thus the country free from pes-
tilential exhalations and salubrious for ever. They will form roads
to move carriages on them without machine—they will drive your
thrashing or pressing machines, your mills, your factories, in short,
all your stationary machines. They will do that most important
business of all, viz. after having prepared and laid out your land in
gardens and orchards, and surrounded them with dams and ditches
for fences—plough and pulverize the soil, sift it from small stones,
roots, fibres, &c, sow, mow, gather and remove the crops to the place
of their final preparation, by thrashing machines, presses, mills, &c.
driven by the same power gratuitously.
To all this effect suffices the easy attendance of three or four men
to one machine, not much bigger nor more complicated than a com-
mon wagon, with a capital less than an equal extent of land would
require for the most common implements (such as ploughs, spades,
hoes, axes, &c.) one dollar per acre, or 20,000 dollars at rw
cultivating a garden of 20,000 acres, producing as much as 40,000
acres of your present best agriculture, enough for the wants of
40,000 men in this climate, and for more than 100,000 men in
the tropical climates.
Ye, who are poor and of the labouring class, do not be alarmed
at this invention. It will not deprive you of your poor pittance tor
sustaining life, obtainable now by your petty drudgery. When
20,000 acres of garden can be cultivated by three or four men, with
but one dollar capital (once for ever) per acre, you may easily be-
come share-holders of joint stock companies, by paying from twenty
to thirty dollars, and even this small sum, partly orentirely, in work
of from one to three months, once for ever, and then enjoy the pro-
duce of from ten to twenty acres for each share, without further
trouble or expense—ami then live like gentlemen and ladies, to much
belter purposes than those of a dull animal in a tread mill.
Ye capitalists are under no restriction of applying your means to

never thought, nor did their school-masters teach them to survey
the resources (the powers and productions) of nature, and using them
for the best benefit of man. Their study ever has been how to take
from each other what little they possessed.
The savage and the civilized man act on the impulse of the narrow
circumstances of the moment, the customs and their confined horizon.
6 INTRODUCTION.
Murdering or enslaving many millions of human beings, supersti-
tious persecutions, search after a little yellow and white metal, and
glistening pebbles of no utility, cultivation and traffic in useless or
worse than useless articles, that form the staple of commerce (what
is the utility of tobacco, coffee, tea, dyestuff for mankind, if it was
not for silly habits ?) some drugs, &c. have been as yet but the fruits
of the discovery and conquest of the new worlds, that could be the
happy abodes of a hundred times the population of all the civilized
world.
With these facts before your eyes, are you yet willing to re-echo
the boast of our age being an enlightened one? A most unfortunate
notion, that keeps man a stationary being. Our age is richer in
knowledge of the globe than any former, the civilized nations are
more powerful, by their gunpowder and navigation, than any of the
past ages—but our age wants enlightening, i. e. a rational use of
this knowledge.
Rise, for once, above your present petty concerns, to a survey of
the materials of your present world, within your reach, for a better
existence. Cease, for once, the practice of blindly ridiculing
with boyish levity every attempt to progress in science and improve-
ments. Remember the disgrace to humanity, that neither Columbus,
nor Robert Fulton, nor any man who did something towards the
progress of the human race, could find men, but only boys to hoot at
their propositions, instead of examining them and reasoning, like
men ought to do, for their own benefit and that of mankind in general.
Read, and read again, the brief and rich contents of my " Paradise,"
and this present book, until you have comprehended them fully
—
they are yet the only books you have on the science to produce the
substances of life and real wealth in abundance, by nature's power
—
the only science necessary to mankind. There is nothing in them
above the meanest comprehension—no fancy or guess work, but
only plain material things, such as you can see and handle your-
selves.—See whether you can discover any falsehood, any insuffi-
ciency of proofs, any thing that is not proved by experience within
your own knowledge—examine and scrutinize the subject—exact
investigation is the sign of intelligence (good sense); prejudice, that
prevents examination, the sign of a brute, not of prudence or wit.
—
The examination, here requested of you, will cost you less exertion
than your ordinary drudgery of one week, and the result of this
little inquiry will save you and your friends and posterity for ever
from all drudgery and poverty.
If I was rich enough, knowing as I do the repugnance to a little
mental exertion. I would, for the benefit of the poor human aped.es,
cheat you into the task of learning and examining the matter laid
before you. 1 would do as kind school masters do with their little
GENERAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE SYSTEM. 7
pupils—they will give to the pupils a little sugar for learning their
lessons, and thus cheat them into learning. I would set a premium,
not of sugar, but of money, for learning this my new science, say
for instance, 810 to any poor, and $100 to any rich, lazy individual,
and a still higher premium for discovering any material error or in-
sufficiency of my proofs for the purposes expressed by me, sav $1000.
This would be more than sufficient to cheat you all into learning the
means for your own great fortune, for 1 know you will do much
more for such a sum of money than the small trouble here required.
But as the case is now, you will have to wait for such an irresistible
inducement to examination, until 1 shall possess the wealth for it, or
some other liberal body will do as much for you. In the meantime,
you may take my good will for the deed.
GENERAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE SYSTEM.
The principle and advantage of this, or any other mechanical
contrivance, consists, as I have stated already in my " Paradise," not
in the mere machinery, but in the efficiency and cheapness of power
to drive the machine.
People of sound sense are, therefore, not puzzled with inventing
a machine for accomplishing a certain purpose, but they look for the
power for it, and seek the advantage of machinery in the cheapness
of the fencer for the machines or tools.
If this doctrine appears new to you, it is merely owing to your
school masters, who did not instruct you of it, being a branch of
mathematics, though the chief one of real utility, which they would,
in all likelihood, think as foreign to a liberal education as the making
your shoes and coats yourselves. These school masters may, how-
ever, be excusable for this lack of reason on the same plea as you,
viz. : that their school masters afforded to them no better education.
Still you may easily supply this defect by a little reflection of your
own, for which no period of your life is too late.
To contrive a tool or machine effecting a certain purpose a little
better than another, is but a small matter, though it may be of great
advantage to some individuals.
I directed my study to the source of useful machinery, i. e. the
powers, and then to the most useful of all machines first.
I investigated and surveyed the great powers in nature, in order
to select the cheapest and most universal ones of them. Next to
GENERAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE SYSTEM.
this inquiry, I thought the machine to cultivate the land and multiplv
the substances of human life, the real wealth, to be the most useful
of all others. I found, at the same time, the operations of agricul-
ture to be the simplest and coarsest of all human works, requiring,
therefore, the least complexity of tools. I found the cheapest powers
to be those that cost nothing at all, and among them those the most
preferable that are the most universal, viz. : wind and water.
It is generally the case that those things which are constantly
before our eyes, attract the least notice of us. Some fellow, on
being shown a forest before him, asked : " Where is the forest ?
1 cannot see it, there are too many trees." " Why, my friend, these
trees are what is called a forest," was the reply. " Oh, I have seen
these trees long before this time," he rejoined, " is that all ?"
Those, who are like him, will say, on reading of the power of wind
and waterfall, in my " Paradise," &c.—" Oh, I knew all that long
ere this : show me but your wonderful machines to do the proposed
work—this is the mystery which you are unable to solve. When
you will have made the machines, and in operation, I will come and
see ; but until then, let me alone with any of your reasonings."
—
And thus they imagine to have fairly dismissed the subject.
If such were the observation but of certain individuals or classes
of people, we might dismiss them as mere idiots and not deem them
deserving any further notice. But what shall I do, if this is the
universal reception of my proofs? Why, if that is all I have to
expect from my cotemporaries, not even any attention, not any
examination, [ may as well cry in the wilderness, and reason with
monkeys ;
you confess then, it is quite as foolish in me to attempt
reasoning with you. Science, reason, all proceeding from facts,
have then no v/eightin the scale of your estimation. You want me
first to make the machines and with them the paradise itself, before you
will care for my arguments. You may wait then till doomsday, for
I declare I am as little able to do all this myself as to build a palace,
or a first rate ship, or make a railroad of a hundred miles with my
own hands and means, though I know how to make them and prove
their feasibility nearly as well as my machines and paradise.
I am forced to these remarks ; for my " Paradise" has been before
the American public and government these seven years, and before
the British public these five years ; it lias been read by thousands,
and come to the notice of hundreds of thousands—it proves by unde-
niable plain facts what I assert in it, and solicits but examination,
and all without effect—this speaks volumes.
I published it not for amusement, hut for study and reflection and
causing application to me for further communications. I defy the
world to disprove my facts and arguments derived therefrom.
When learning will descend from the heavens, and from the
GENERAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE SYSTEM. 9
rubbish of ignorant, barbarous antiquity, down to the plain material
substances of our present world—when the study of plain real things
will be valued more than obscure words of indefinite meaning
—
when governments will think it their business to provide for the well
being of the community and to investigate the means for it—then my
" Paradise" and this present book will become the paramount object of
inquiry and the first science of every man, woman and child, until
they can show a more important, a more useful one.
Must I then prove, that the productiveness of the earth, and the
powers to cultivate it, are the chief, nay, the sole resources of human
happiness ? —When you admit the truth of my proofs, that both the
productiveness of the globe and the powers of nature exist in super-
abundance, have your highly and profoundly learned schoolmasters
cultivated your understanding so little, that you cannot draw any
useful inference from these facts?—When you are taught how any
portion you desire of those gigantic powers, in any place, can be
made to cause any rotatory or vibratory motion of a wheel or shaft
—
can all this induce you to no conclusion, how then any machine may
be connected with that wheel or shaft and receive the impulse of that
power, which may thus be transferred from place to place and ren-
dered operative on any machine? Could all these demonstrations of
plain simple facts in my " Paradise" afford no ground to contrive then
the adapted tools or machines for any mechanical purpose, or induce-
any person, or aggregate of persons, high or low, rich or poor,
learned or unleared, to comply with my request, to make themselves
known to me and express their desire for a further communication
on the minor details offered by me for the specified purposes, in case
, they could not, or would not, supply them themselves ?
Perhaps the following simile will help to understand my reasoning.
Suppose somebody should come to a farmer and say ; " I have
invented a glorious machine, that will plough all your lands ; so you
need no longer leave your many hundred acres of woods and
prairies idle ; my invention will plough them all." The farmer
would probably be curious enough to see that useful invention ; and
lo ! what should he behold ?—a number of ploughs joined together,
to plough many furrows at once ! Upon this the farmer would justly
ask: " What is to pull all these ploughs?" " Why what else," would
the inventor say, " but your horses or oxen." " My friend," the
farmer would observe, " what is the utility of your invention of joining
ploughs together, if I have to apply to them my beasts and drivers
as well as before ?" " But are not my ploughs very useful ?" the
inventor might say—and the farmer : " Yes, but it is not from want
of ploughs, that I leave waste my land, but for want of horses or oxen,
of food for them, and of wages for men to attend to them, which
requires a good deal of money. If I had them, I could easily do
10 GENERAL ILLUSTEATIONS OF THE SYSTEM.
without ploughs ; a limb of a tree shaped by me into a sort of hook
would do the business then already, though good iron ploughs a little
better."
On the other hand, let us suppose, somebody should come to a
farmer and tell him :
" I have found a most useful animal, that is
a hundred times stronger than a horse, is most obedient, has no self-
will at all, will never die, never tire, but work day and night, for ever,
it neither eats nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor is in any way burthensome;
and with all these precious qualities it is very cheap, it costs nothing
at all, and you may have as many of such animals as you like—one
driver is enough to drive a number of these mammoth animals. Now
you may farm all your lands and much more of your neighbours', if
you choose, much cheaper with these animals than they can afford
to do." Suppose the farmer would reply: " What is the use of these
animals; show but the machine for the use of such strong animals,
or else I care not for them." The discoverer of these animals, if he
should happen to possess more sense than those, who cannot see the
use of my powers, would have to reply :
" Why, my friend, what
great machine can it require to break and crumble your soil, for
receiving the seed and admitting air and moisture, if you have
strength enough and to spare ? Take a log, or a big harrow, with any
sort of pricks or hooks, to hook and tear into the ground, and—put
the strong animal before it—till you find somebody willing to accom-
modate you with tools a little better."
So it is with all the works of agriculture, and any other in, or
upon, the ground ; they are the very simplest and coarsest of all
human operations, but the most useful and universal of all.
You have here the case of my " Paradise" and of the present work.
My "Paradise" supplies you with the knowledge of powers and their
management to render them operative on machines; my present
book with that of mere tools.
People of sound sense and inflection appreciate my " Paradise"
above all things—no matter that its materials were not unknown
before—idiots value my machine only as the principal thing, until
they will discover, that my machine also contains nothing new, like
my " Paradise," still does the business purposed.
The value of my mechanical system consists then
1. In having powers enough and gratuitously;
2. In making them drive any stationary machine, and
3. In making the stationary machine drive a locomotive.
The first and second part is amply proved in my " Paradise," and
the third pointed out in a general way, but will be minutely shown
in the present book.
A water wheel, or in defect of it, a windmill, drives a locomotive,
DESCRIPTION OF THE MACHINERY. 11
called by me the Satelitc, which performs the preparatory and agri-
cultural works.
To create a constant power from an interrupted and irregular one,
like wind, a windmill is to be erected, and by its power the Satclite
to be driven, to form the elevated reservoir, and, if wanted, also a
well.
When this is done, more windmills may be erected around the
reservoir, and each of them raise water from the well or other water
below up to the elevated reservoir, by an endless chain of buckets,
or otherwise, until the reservoir is full. Then a water wheel at an
outlet of the reservoir, to be turned by a waterfall from it, is to be
constructed, which, thereafter is to drive the Satelite,orany stationary
machine.
In cases where water can be collected into the reservoir from
running water, from a higher ground, or from periodical rains, &c.,
the windmills will not be necessary. Such cases will occur on de-
clivities of mountains, or in tropical regions during the rainy seasons
almost any where.
The water power may thus be obtained for ever, of any amount,
for any place, being transferable to places of many miles distance,
through canals or pipes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE MACHINERY.
(1) The Windmill.
To save all attendance of men, I suggest a horizontal one, which
requires no adjusting to the wind, and as the simplest 1 can think

position, while the wind presses them on one side against
them, and when their opposite sides are presented to the
wind, their lower parts being the broadest, are lifted up by
the wind, and kept in a horizontal position, presenting thus
only their edges to the wind.
The wings on one side of the windmill will thus be
always shut, and receive the full force of the wind, while
those on the opposite side are open, and let the wind pass
through their interstices.

be turned, by a push of the conductor, at its pivot, from
one side to the other while the axle-tree revolves. When
the bar forms right angles with the axle-tree and being
sunk with its fore end to the ground so as to stick
against it, the progress of the Satelite makes it rise in a
vertical position and stand on one end, and lift thus the hind
part of the Satelite above the ground, which is to balance
on the bar ; this is the moment, when the conductor has to
push it on that side he wants, to alter the Satelite's direc-
tion as required.

mer, which then falls down, on the object, or on a wedge placed into
the spot intended. The repetition of these blows on the same spot
must break any object. The handle may be perforated with a series
of holes to shift the hammer's place on it, and the handle also along

satelite, so that the extent of the hammer's operation may be from one
to two rods square at each side and more, without moving the
satelite from its place. When thus 6 to 10 square rods are operated
upon, the satelite may proceed to another stand.

" " 20, the object to be sawed, lying on the ground,
" « 21, 22, the line of the horizon.
In this operation the cog 6, 7, XVI. and XVII. remains in its posi-
tion fixed: the beam 1,11, XVII., is to vibrate from one side to the
other, to move on the ground back and forward the beam 14, 15
with the saw, which the conductor has to direct at 20 at the com-
mencement of the cut. The bolts at 1,2, XVI. XVII. in both beams
14, 15 and 1, 11 may be shifted in their holes respectively, and
thereby, the operation extended along each side of the satelite and
distanced from it to an area of two rods long and two to four rods
broad on both sides, or of about eight to sixteen square rods, without
moving the satelite from the spot. Thus this saw may cut lying or
standing trees and stumps, and also, with blunter teeth, rocks.
To cut wood (trees, stumps, roots, &c.) and rocks out of the
ground and in rectangular shapes, the same contrivance may be
changed into the following :

into any inclination. The vibratory motion of this saw
being an arch, sufficiently great, of a circle, so that alter-

the cut and above the ground, throws the saw dust out of it
at each move.
" " 26, 32, is a slit, through which the bolt 35 passes easily,

moving from the tree the rope 9, 7 is pulled, the pole 6, 8
raised with its hook, when high enough, the conductor
directs it sideways to clasp the tree, then kicks the end 8
on the ground off the ground, and the force of the Satelite
pulls the rope at the hook 6, 7, while the pricked cylinder
of it takes firm hold into the ground like anchors, until the
tree 1, 2, comes into the position 2, 10, when its own
weight finishes its fall.
The hook may be applied also for pulling roots, stones, &c., out
of the ground.

completed Satelite, fig. III., and indicated also in fig. XII., 11, 68,
together with the plough described of fig. III. and IV. and fig. XII..
68, 69, 70.
R. To make small Ditches.
The same plough is to be placed in the middle of the Satelite's
frame, as indicated by the dotted lines 67, 71, 72, 73, fig. XII. the
pricks or spades of the cylinder may be taken out, except in its
middle for the width of the ditch, to break the earth loose for it ; the
plough will then scoop the earth out and leave it along on one side
of the ditch ; then a return in the same track may increase the ditch
and leave the earth on the other side of the ditch.
S. To level the Earth.
A transversal log as described and indicated of the fig. XII.
and XIII. by 43, will effect it, by passing and repassing the Satelite
in the same track, which at each time breaks, by the pricked cylinder,
more soil loose, while the said logs shoves it before itself ahead, fill-
ing thereby hollow places underneath, and lowering eminences
gradually.
T. To form Terraces on Declivities.
The diagonal log 11, 3, fig. XII. is to be applied while the Satelite,
by putting a log or higher wheels on the lower side of the slope, is
kept level—the earth will then be'broken loose by the pricks of the
cylinder on the higher side, and shoved off" by the said log to the
lower, and the repetition continued of this operation until the terrace
has its desired level.
U. To operate in Water or Mud.
The same contrivance as described in the respective cases, are

used, only with the addition of a high place for the conductor to be
above water on the Satelite.
V. To excavate Mines.
-
Vertical pits are to be made by the Satelite in the same mode
as described for excavating wells, fig. IV.
Horizontal shafts may be excavated by the hammer, fig. XVII.,
13, driving a wedge by its fall into the earth or rock, ahead of the
satelite—and the objects thus broken loose to be dragged out by a
hooked scraper.

and by it incline the poles 10, 11 and 16, 17 forward, which will
guide in consequence, by their being dragged by the sweeping ropes
of the Satelite, the cart in concentrical course.
The slackness of these ropes may be at the rate of sinking, one-tenth
of their length between their points of support ; consequently, if the
supporting poles be 20 feet high, the height of the ropes at the
Satelite, 4 feet, the distance between the
Satelites and the cart may be then, 4X 10 + 20X 10ft.=240 feet,

nection between the Satelite through the centre of the new Orbit,
to the water power being effected, the Satelite begins to move in the
new Orbit. The wire lines need, as the figure XXV. shows, never
extend beyond the second Orbit, or the length of 4000 feet. The
wires around the reservoir may be stationary. All the Orbits together
within the reach of the wires, and depending for their power from
the same centre, I call a Circuit.
(9) THE EXTENT OF OPERATION OF ONE PRIMARY
•
STATIONARY POWER.
If the. primary power be the power of wind mills, the reacting or
secondary power is that of a waterfall.
If a waterfall is used already, without being created by wind
power, the primary power is this waterfall itself.
In both cases, any power derived from one and the same reservoir
at a distance, I call a secondary power.
DEMONSTRATIONS. 27
Each Circuit is to have at its centre, a stationary power, which
may be a secondary one, derived from a distant reservoir through a
canal or pipe.
It follows, that a number of Circuits may have one common
reservoir, supplying the centre of each Circuit with a water power,
driving a water wheel.
The extent of land for one primary power, whether it consist 01
one or more Circuits, I call a Dominion.
Fi". XXVI. represents a Dominion, each hexagon of it a Circuit, to
the number of 55, each may be about 1400 acres, in all
about 80,000 acres, with a radius of about eight or nine
miles, each Circuit having one mile for its radius.
The lines from centre to centre of each Circuit indicate the
feeding canals or pipes, to be conducted between the Orbits, in a
serpentine direction in consequence, to avoid needless obstruction to
the tracks of the Satelite. . .
As one Satelite may cultivate 20,000 acres, such a Dominion
would then require four Satelites. I call the extent of the operation
of one Satelite a Range.
A Range may be in more than one Dominion, and consist of
connected
3
or unconnected Circuits. Circuits or Orbits ought to be
as regularly, and nearly circularly, shaped as possible, for the sake
of economy of time and expense.
The forms of Ranges and Dominions are regulated but by local
circumstances.
DEMONSTRATIONS.
§ 1. If the Satelite's track is one rod wide, and it moves two miles
per hour, it ploughs in one hour 4 acres, in twenty-four hours, 96 or
nearly 100 acres, and in one hundred days 10,000 acres ;
if moving
four miles per hour, in one hundred days, 20,000 acres.
§ 2. If the Satelite moves with a sithe of two and a half rods in
radius, with a sweep of five rods, and moves six miles per hour, it
will mow in one hour 5 X 12 =60 acres, in twenty-four hours 1440
acres, and allowing one-sixth of the time for shifting the Orbits,
remain 1200 acres for one day, and for 20,000 acres
120()
=
17 days, say 20 days.
§ 3. Suppose the crop of one acre to weigh five tons ;
the crops
of 20,000 acres will weigh 100,000 tons.
28 DEMONSTRATIONS.
If the Satelite carry 20 tons for each load, the number of loads
will be for 100,000 tons 5000.
The radius of the Orbit to be 1000 feet, about equal to the
average distance to the places of deposit, in the corners between the
Orbits, makes 2000 feet for each transport. To remove the crops
of 20,000 acres will then require 5000 X 2000 feet, or nearly 2000
miles to travel with the Satelite. If this be done at the average rate
of four miles per hour, the removal of 20,000 acres will require
20,000 ,
.
,-
-^2i
days =20 daYs nearly.
§ 4. Suppose the agriculture should require a second ploughing
between the plants for extirpating weeds, &c.
The shovel ploughs (fig. XIV.) may be extended one-half rod
further at each side, in all to two rods across the Satelite's track, and
the Satelite move at the rate of six miles per hour, it will plough
then in one hour 24 acres, in 24 hours 576 acres, allowing one-sixth
of the time for shifting the Orbits, about 500 acres, per day, and for
20,000 acres it would require then -^7.— days=40 days.
§ 5. The cultivation of 20,000 acres, inclusive mowing, gathering
and removing the crops, will then be done,
for the first ploughing (§ 1.) in 100 days,
" mowing (§ 2.) 20 "
" gathering and removing crops (§ 3.) 20 "
in all 140 days
If a second ploughing of 20,000 acres be done (§ 4.) 40 «
then in all, 180 days.
This leaves then about one-half of the year for other operations,
not belonging to agriculture.
§ 6. If in soil, cleared from all impediments and softened by proper
irrigation, one plough will be drawn by one horse, and sixteen ploughs
be carried by the Satelite, the ploughing ofthe Satelite would be effected
by sixteen horses at the rate of about four miles per hour. The
power to be added for turning the pricked cylinder will be gained in
ploughing since that operation has then broken the ground. The
hind part of the Satelite may be made not to exceed two tons' weight,
and being on wheels, would require less than four horses' power in addi-
tion. Allowing further for the operation of the comb, levelling and
sowing eight horses' power, and for friction, though very trifling,
four horses' power, the whole requisite power would amount to
16 + 4 + 8 + 4 horses' power=32 horses' power. But say fifty
horses' power.
DEMONSTRATIONS. 29
§7. If one horse's power is equal to 2001b. raised, or removing a
resistance equal to it, two feet per second, it follows, that 50 horses'
1
power is equal to the raising of 200 X 501b= 10,0001b 2 feet per
second, and, if at the rate of 4 miles per hour or about feet
v
60X60
=6 feet per second, the same power of 100001b at 2 feet is equal to
lb= 34001b. nearly at 6 feet per second.

§ 8. If the motion of the ends of the balance beam (fig. XII. and
XIII., 15, 16) be made 10 times as great (by the proportion of the
balance's length) as that of the advancement of the Satelite, the
force required will be (§ 7.) —-— =340 lb., say 400 lb.
§ 9. The tendency of swinging the Satelite at its hind wheels, by
the pull of the ropes at the balance beam's ends, will be in the inverse
ratio of the wheel's distance from the fulcrum, at the pivot of said
balance, which being shorter, it may be rated at 400 X — =300 lb.
which is less than the weight of the hind part of the satelite requires
to move it sideways. But if it were not, it might be increased, and
besides the felloes of the hind wheels might be made sharp so as to
cut into the ground.
§ 10. The ropes pulling at the said balance beams' ends, having
to overcome but 400 lb. weight or resistance (§ 8.) will be sufficient
of one half to one inch diameter.
Their weight for the maximum of their length (of 1000 feet) will
then be about 150 to 600 lb.
§ 11. If these ropes are carried by three carts at intervals, each
will have to carry less than 50 to 200 lb. of the rope. If each cart
weighs 100 lbs. the total weight of all three carts and loads will be
then 450 to 900 lb. The rate of their run will be in proportion to
their distance from the orbit's centre (1 fig. XXIV.) and the average
rate of all three carts then about one half of that of the Satelite. Sup-
pose 900 lb, drawn on wheels at a common horse's walk (i. e. of the
Satelite's motion) be done by one horse ; the half of that rate of
motion will then require one half horse's power, and 450 lb. one quar-
ter of one horse's power.
The additional power requisite to move along the three carts and
their ropes is, therefore, less than one horse's power, or at most one
quarter to a half horse's power, i. e. —to — of the whole power.
§ 12. An iron wire of one line or one-twelfth of an inch in diameter
can bear about 3001b. before it tears, being suspended at one end. Ifthe
wire be one-quarter of an inch in diameter, it will bear then 3 X 3 X
30 DEMONSTRATIONS.
300 lb. =2700 lb; the weight it has to sustain in the pulls at the
Satelite is 400 lb. (§8) or nearly one-seventh of its strength.
§13'. If the utmost extent of the wire lines (fig. XXV.) be 4000
feet, the two wires then 8000 feet long, and a quarter of an inch in

,
^8' 144 1152
cubic feet, or about 2 and three-fourths cubic feet. Suppose one cubic
foot of iron to weigh about 500 lb., the wires will then weigh
2^X500 lb. =1375 lb.
Suppose the component pieces 20 feet long each, and at each joint
to be added two rings and two light wheels of 6—8 inches in diame-
ter, in all weighing 1 lb., the number of joints being then =
*u
400, their additional weight will be 400 lb.
The weight of the wires and appurtenances, in their utmost extent,
will then be 1375 + 400 =1775 lb., say 1800 lb.
§ 14. According to experiments of Mr. Bevan, British engineer,
a load on wheels on a sandy road is moved by one-fifth of its weight,
and on a beaten gravel road by one-thirt)r -third of its weight. Con-
sequently the weight ofthe wires, being 1800 lb. (§ 13.) would require
in the first case —— =360 lb., or nearly as much power again as
the satelites motion, and in the second case =551b., or about
oo
one-eighth of the same power in addition.
In the first case the aggregate power for the Satelite would be
50
50 + 50=100 horses' power; in the second case only 50 + — =56
8
horses' power. The roads for the wire lines are but a few inches
wide, and may easily, and by but one passage of the Satelite with a
narrow roller bearing the whole weight of the Satelite, be compressed
as hard and level as any beaten gravel road.
The aggregate power at the water wheel, with the addition of one
half horse's for the ropes (§ 11.) would then be fifty-six and a half
horses', say 60 horses' power.
§ 15. The sum of power required will not be altered, if the motion
of the pulls be made shorter and slower, which may be done by
making the diameter of the lower part of the roller 1, fig. XXIV. less,
than the upper one for the ropes, to produce the same effect, though
ihc wires arc then to sustain a proportionate greater strength and to
be thicker; for the increase of weight will be balanced by the decrease
of motion in proportion. Say for instance, instead of a quarter, half
inch the diameter of the wires, their weight then 4x 1375 (§ 13.) +
DEMONSTRATIONS. 31
400=5900 lb. their motion will be but one-quarter of that in the
former cases (§ 74.) stated.—To cause a slower vibration of
longer stokes or pulls, and accelerate the Satelite's motion too, at
will, the diameter of the pricked cylinder may be increased, or an
intermediate cogwheel between the propelling stokes and the cylinder
be applied so as to make the latter revolve a greater portion of its
circumference at each stroke.
§16. Suppose the water-fall 35 to 40 feet deep, its descent in the
water wheel six feet per second ; one cubic foot of water will then,
sinking six feet per second, balance the raising of three cubic feet, two
feet per second and be about equal to one horse's power, and the sixty
horses' power will require sixty cubic feet at that rate of descent in
a water wheel of about thirty feet in diameter.
§ 17. If one third of the wheel's circumference, or about 30 feet,
carries water to the amount of 60 cubic feet, it will make for each
foot's length 2 cubic feet, and if for each foot's length one bucket?
being in the form of a wedge, the buckets will have to be about two
feet deep, by nearly two and a half feet's breadth.
§ 18. The water required for 60 horses' power is„»hen, at the rate
of filling 6 buckets each of 2 cubic feet, or 12 cubic feet, per
second; consequently in 24 hours 12x60x60x24=1,036,800,
say 1,000,000 cubic feet, and in 30 days 30,000,000 cubic feet.
5 19. Suppose, for example, one reservoir for four Ranges or
about 80,000 acres, as fig. XVI. represents ; it will have to spend in
30 days 4X 30,000,000 cubic feet= 120,000,000 cubic feet of wuLur.
If the depth of the reservoir be 20 feet, its area will have to be for
that case
~ '
' — square feet = 6,600,000 square feet; if a
square, each side will be 2500 feet nearly, its area in acres 136.
The square for its enclosure will be about 100 feet broad, this will
make its outside 2,700 feet long, its area, inclusive
enclosure, 158 acres, say 160 acres, which is ^ n „„„ =irx-„ of the
J
80,000 500
whole Dominion. If the height of the reservoir be twice as great
or 60 feet, its area will have to be the half of it, or about ——— of
the Dominion.
§ 20. The evaporation is in the hottest and driest days one-third
of an inch, which would be in thirty days ten inches, which is of

daj's, require three such wind-mills, and for all four Ranges twelve
wind-mills, which are indicated at the figure of the reservoir. But
they may be increased to any number required.
§ 22. The beginning ofthe Satelite's operation is to be made on the
highest spot of the intended Dominion, by a windmill previously
erected, in case no water power exist already near it. The clearing
of the ground of the projected reservoir from trees, &c, is the first
operation, if not free of them already. This, as well as all other
operations of the Satelite,is to be effected in Orbits.
J
23. The Satelite begins at the outside of the Orbit in one of the
corners between the Orbits, and proceeds in a strait line to the
centre of the Orbit, tearing down trees, sawing them into convenient
pieces and removing them into that corner as close together as well
feasible, always taking a small patch at a time, till having cleared the
road to the centre. Then the Satelite may tear down a row of trees
on both sides of this avenue, and when come round to the same
spot of its commencement, saw one tree after another in as small
pieces as necessary for removal, and remove the pieces to the same
corner. Thus'ft continues tearing down, sawing and removing the
trees, &c, always taking a row of about forty feet's width, until
reaching the two next corners, to which then the pieces are removed,
in the further progress, and so on till the whole Orbit is cleared all
around the centre.
5,24. Suppose the Satelite moves during the operation -of pulling
down trees, at the rate of five hundred feet per hour, pulling down
every tree one after another within a track forty feet wide, this
will make for every hour, 40 X 500=20,000 square feet=73 square
rods ; if the area of the Orbit be seventy acres,and the half of the
three surrounding corners about ten acres, the whole area to be
cleared for one Orbit will be eighty acres, of which the uprooting of
.. , -n

all the trees will consequently require ———=175 hours or
about seven days.
§ 25. Suppose the Satelite extends its sawing operations at each
of its stands to one rod in length and two and a half rods in breadth,
and performs them in ten minutes ; eighty acres will then require for
80X160 n .
tfls sawing operations ——r X 10 minutes=36 days.
2-2
§ 26. For hauling the trees, &c, to the respective corners of the
Orbit, the mean distance may be estimated at four hundred feet,
which to and fro makes eight hundred feet, for each voyage, of
which ten may be then performed in one hour. If each stand
(5 25.) of the Satelite's operation of sawing should require one
voyage for the removal of the trees, &c, within its two and a
DEMONSTRATIONS. 33
half square rods, the time for eighty acres would then be for all
removals -r-,——-=512 hours=22 days nearly.
2^X10
$ 27. The Satelite may then travel over all the area of the Orbit
to hook out of the ground the remaining smaller roots and stones,
&c. If this be done at the rate of one half mile per hour, it will make
one acre per hour, and the seventy acres of land of the Orbit
will require seventy hours or nearly three days, and supposing the
removal of the objects out of the Orbit to require six days more ;
this will make in all nine days for one Orbit. Occasionally the
hammer may be used.
§ 28. The sharply edged rings at the ends of the pricked cylin-
der, fig. V. may be used in all these operations.
§ 29. The Satelite may then travel once more over all the Orbit,
ploughing and tearing out of the ground and sifting the small rem-
nants of roots, &c, and depose them in piles along its track. If
this be done at the rate of one and a half miles per hour, it will take
for seventy acres one day.
§ 30. The Satelite may then level the ground, in taking off the
prominences and filling the deeper places, by passing and repassing
with the pricked cylinder and the transversal board.
Suppose the mean difference between the higher and lower places;
be ten feet, the mean of it then five feet, the height taken off and
filled with it lower places six inches at each passage ;
it will require
then 10 passages ; if this be the case all over the Orbit of seventy
acres, and the Satelite move at the rate of four miles per hour, it
70
will make for each passage — =9 hours, and for ten passages ninety
8
hours or about four days.
§ 31. The ditches for irrigation, and the trenches with their banks
around the Orbit for fences are then to be made. Suppose the
ditches for irrigation to run in a spiral line four rods apart, they
will then be about nine miles long, and be run with a single caving
plough as indicated fig. XII. 71.72, 73 in two hours, and back, in
two hours, in all four hours. The trenches and dams for enclosure
around the Orbit are about six thousand feet long, and the bottom and
top respectively of both equal to the width of the Satelite's track, or
eighteen feet, and four feet at most below and above the level, forming
thus a dam eight feet high. If each passage of the Satelite takes
but two inches out of the trench, and another passage puts the same
48 48
upon the bank along (by the diagonal log), it will require— X —

48 passages, each six thousand feet. If two are performed in one
hour, it will take twenty-four hours for the whole. On the outward

slopes of the trench and dam, and also the top of the latter may be
planted useful and ornamental hedges, to consolidate the dam and
increase the impediment to the access of animals.
§ 32. All the preparatory works of one Orbit, to change wild
woods into a perfect garden, consist then,

according to § 29, for rough ploughing, 1 day,
" " 30, " levelling, '
" 4 "
" " 31, « ditching, 1 "
in all 6 days,
§ 34. The formation of the reservoir will generally consist in
forming a dam around its place, which at most needs to be twenty
feet high, with a ditch at its outside of thirty feet deep, as the figure
VII. shows. Suppose the Satelite takes at each passage but one
inch of soil away in the ditch, and that it requires, in an average,
two other passages, to shove and raise that loose earth over to the
place of the dam, as described, by the diagonal log 11, 68, fig. XII.
;
for each half inch, three passages, makes for twenty feet, 3x 20 X
12=720 passages. At each half foot's rise of the dam, the Satelite
may pass with a smooth cylinder, instead of a pricked one, over the
top of the dam, to compress the loose earth of it into compactness,
which requires then forty passages more, 720x40=760; say 800
passages, will be then required.
In the case supposed of a reservoir for four ranges, the inside
being 2,500, the outside 2,700 feet, it makes a mean length of 2,600
feet or about a half mile for each side of the square, and conse-
quently, for each of the four Sateliies to be applied, eight hundred
passages at a half mile, in all four hundred miles which the Satelite
has to travel. If this be done at the rate of two miles per hour, or
about fifty miles per day, it will require then in all — =8 days, for
the reservoir.
The well, if any is to be excavated, may also be formed by four
DEMONSTKATIONS. • 35
Satelites at once. The well's bottom being at a level with that of
the ditch around the reservoir, in the case supposed then thirty feet
deep, the slopes at an angle of forty-five degrees, will make it thirty
feet all around wider at the top than at the bottom, which may be
twenty feet in diameter. The upper diameter of the well will ther.
be 20 + 2 X 30=80 feet. The cubical contents of the earth to be
taken out will consequently be, its shape being a truncated cone,
3 :t
40—10.
—-—X 3. 141 . . . =63,000 cubic feet nearly. Suppose the
Satelite carries at each of its passages diametrically through the well,
as fig. VI. shows, 100 cubic feet of earth; it will require then
63,000 . 630
=630 passages, and with four Satelites —— =160 passages
nearly. Suppose each passage to be about 200 feet long, the Satelite
would have to pass 160 X 200 =32,000 feet, or about six miles, which
may be performed then in six hours. In all other cases, where
either the well has to be excavated deeper or the bottom of the
reservoir is higher in relation to the level of the water outside of
it, the extent of the reservoir, and consequently also of its dam
and ditch, are less.
If the work can be accomplished in less time by the scoop or
scraper, it is to be preferred. The time required for the formation
of the reservoir and well is then not more than eight days.
§ 35. If at the beginning windmills arc applied for the formation of
the reservoir and well, one-half of the time may be calculated for
the loss during calms ; and therefore the double amount, i. e. sixteen
days, be required.
§ 36. To transfer the water power to the centre of each Circuit
of the Dominion, dams with small canals or ditches on their tops
are to be constructed. The length of all the dams for one Range
of fourteen Circuits, in the Dominion represented by fig. XXVI. may
be estimated at about twenty-five miles, its height equal to that of
the reservoir, say twenty feet, and its breadth somewhat less than
that of the reservoir; be it equal. If (§ 34.) one half mile requires
eight days, twenty-five miles will require 25x2-x 8=400 days, for
all the dams. The canals or ditches on their tops will but require
two passages of the Satelite with the excavating plough, that is
2x 25=50 miles, which may be effected in one day. The whole
time for the dams and canals throughout the Dominion be then
estimated in a round number to four hundred days at most, which
400
amounts for each Circuit to about —- =30 days.

§ 37. Suppose the worst case that can be, where in a country of
several hundred thousand acres no elevated place above the level of

36 ESTIMATIONS OF EXPENSES AND PROFITS.
twenty or thirty feet of water could be found, but all to be a dead
level with water up to the surface of the land, a swamp for example.
In this case the bottom of the reservoir would have to be raised by
carrying earth from the ground around it to the place to be raised,
which for four Ranges, as in the fig. XXVI. represented, would be
2,700 feet square. Suppose this to be raised twenty-five feet high.
The solid contents of the earth required for that purpose would then
have to be 2,700~X 25=182,250,000 cubic feet. The distance to
carry the earth may be averaged to 1,000 feet, and a passage to and
fro of the Satelite will then be 2,000 feet. If theSatelite carries at
each passage 400 cubic feet, it being on a level ground and a
firm compressed road, the number of passages will have to be
182,250,000
—-^ =455,625 ; each of 2,000 feet makes 2,000 X 455,625
=911,250,000 feet or about ^—1 or 182,250 miles ; this will
5000
make for each of the four Satelites to be applied, 45,550 miles, which
45 550
at the rate of four miles per hour, will be performed in ———
45,550
,
• 4
hours=--——days= 474 days. Suppose the wind blows but half
the time, the time required will be 2x 474=948 days.
§ 38. As this operation requires but an incompleted Satelite, such
as described of fig. I. and II. the increase of a few of such would
be but a small matter, and there may be as many at once as wind-
mills are to be erected thereafter, which may then be constructed at
once in their full number, and for each one an incompleted Satelite.
The number of them may amount to twenty instead of the supposed
four. The operation for raising the ground of the reservoir twenty-
948
five feet high would then be reduced to —- =190 days or about six
o
months, which time is to be added to that of the preparatory works,
as calculated above.
ESTIMATIONS OF EXPENSES AND PROFITS.
The data are given in the preceding demonstrations, which
include all the cases that may possibly occur. The circumstances
of locality, and prices of labors and produces being very various,
no exact estimation for any case can be reasonably expected here ;
but it must be inferred from the data given, as far as they can be
found correct and applicable to the case. Still some general state-
ESTIMATIONS OF EXPENSES AND PROFITS. 37
ments as examples, for the maximum and minimum of expenses and
proceeds, may serve as guides for any estimation of a particular case.
I shall therefore state a case of the most difficult and most expensive
nature, with the smallest amount of means, also the same with
strong means ; also a case of the most favourable nature, with the
smallest and the largest amount of means well applicable ; and
finally, also a case for a small extent of means and land.
Most cases that will occur in practice will be of a mixed nature
of some of these cases, and may be modified accordingly to the ex-
amples given.
Some extraordinary circumstances that would increase much the
time and expenses, and which will, of course, not be chosen for a
beginning and only for after ages of a greater population and richer
means, when better places can no longer be found uncultivated, may
merely be mentioned here.
Such are
;
1. The ground being very broken, and requiring, therefore, level-
ling by the Satelite in taking off gradually the tops of eminences
and filling therewith the lower places, which is to be done by the
hammer, the pricked cylinder and scoops.
2. Swamps, ponds, periodical inundations, requiring to be drained,
are respectively guarded against by dams : the Satelite has to raise
ground and draw ditches, fill the low places up to a certain level and
form dams where necessary, to confine running waters into narrower
channels.
3. Sterile ground, rocky or sandy, desired to be changed into
fertile land, which is to be effected by the Satelite's taking, by its
scoops, fertile soil where it can be spared, and covering therewith
the sterile places.
4. The hills may not admit of regularly shaped Orbits and Cir-
cuits as described, which require to be changed into terraces by the
•Satelite with the scoop or diagonal shoving log ; also rocks to be
battered by the hammer and carried away by piecemeal.
In all these cases there is but an incompleted Satelite, as
described of fig. 1, II, III, required, and a great number of such may
be applied at once with a comparatively small addition of expenses.

To house and thrash the crops will require an additional capital,
which may be repaid amply by the profit accruing from their use.
Thus, the sheds for housing the crops, consisting only of a roof on
posts for each Orbit, may be built of boards and beams, sawed by a
stationary sawmill in each Circuit, for all the purposes of machine-
ries, buildings, &c. occurring, and their expenses would only consist
in the small amount of wages for their erection and transports of the
materials required, and the straw, &c. of the crops yielding fodder
for live stock would far over pay the same.
The sawmills would not form an object of capital or current
expenses in this agricultural view, they being for the most part of
the time employed for other purposes far overpaying again their
expenses.
The thrashing machine may be of the simplest kind, transportable,
and one sufficient for the whole Range. A row of horizontal beams,
resting on pivots, and one of their ends being lifted up by a shaft
with cogs for each beam, driven in the manner of the Satelite, would
answer ^already the purpose:—a kind of rake might be added to drag
from time to time the bundles required from the shed under the

place of deposit. The further requisites for the final preparations of
the produces are more than repaid by the increase of the price of the
produces.

C. For a Range of twenty thousand Acres of Woods with five
Satelites and one hundred Men.
There may be applied at once one complete, and four incomplete
Satelites, as stated (§ 38, Demons.) in the following mode :
1 Satelite with but the pricked cylinder and a hook, to pull down
trees (§ 32. Demons.) for 1 Orbit, with
1 Satelite with 5 saws, to saw, being 3 rods
longer, and having for each saw 2 men,
1 Satelite with but a thin smooth cylinder,
around which, while lifted above the
ground, wind 4 ropes or chains for haul-
ing, the Satelite being fixed on the
ground, for each rope 2 men, in all
1 Satelite with but a pricked cylinder and hooks,
for hooking, taking out of the ground
and removing smaller objects, with -

5 Satelites in all and 33 men in 7 days.
To be employed 8 hours in 24 requires 3 releases, as maximum,
each of 33 men, makes 99 men, and one for superintendence makes
100 men.
A Circuit of 19 Orbits requires then 19 X 7=133 days, and for

its dam and ditch (§ 36, Demons.) with the same means as above
stated, instead of 30 only 6 days, makes in all for 1 Circuit 139
days, which is less than in the case at B stated.
The progress of the preparatory works, and, in consequence also
the produces, in the first 10 years will then be the same nearly as
atB.
The expenses may be estimated thus

in the 2d year the expenses, and increase every subsequent year
with those of 2 Circuits or 1,400 acres, until they reach their maxi-
mum in the 8th year, of the whole Range, when the annual expenses
will be reduced for ever to the wages of 4 men and small contin-
gencies or about to $1,200 to 2,000.

From the 3d or at most from the 5th year all expenses will be
repaid, and thence a clear profit accrue every subsequent year, in-
creasing with the produces of 70 acres, till the maximum of 1400 to
2000 acres are under cultivation.
F. The same means and extent on Prairies or prepared land, of
1400 to 2000 acres.

Every subsequent year about the same pi'ofit.
From these 6 different cases of estimations, containing the maxi-
mum and the minimum of expenses and profits, it appears, that the
capital in any case may be refunded within 1 to 5 years from the
proceeds ; and thereafter an increase of profits be reaped, till the
maximum of produces is attained, that is, those of 20,000 acres for
1 Satelite and 4 men's attendance. No speculation can be shown
equal in profit to this present case, unless it be a particular and direct
fraud and robbery.
It is to be expected that the stated estimation of prices of produces
will hold good for at least 10 years, considering the natural animal
apathy of men to stick to their old dear customs, which will not allow
them to imitate promptly the presented new means, and retard their
becoming universal for probably a longer time yet. But, be it as it
may, the gradual sinking of the prices of the produces will cause no
loss to any speculator in this matter, since at all events, and even in
the ultimate case, the produces of becoming so cheap and abundant
as water, the owners of such Dominions will have gained a " Para-
dise" for ever, requiring no further addition, and only 4 men's easy
attendance to 1 simple contrivance for 20,000 acres.
When this time will arrive, then other objects, more worthy of
46 MODES OF APPLICATION.
rational creatures, will come into view, such as are presented in my
" Paradise." At present, 1 know, that nothing can engage the atten-
tion of my cotemporaries as the acquisition of wealth, or, its repre-
sentative, money. And, therefore, this present book will be quite
enough for them. To reason with them further, and on the most pro-
per application of these means, and of their first consequences, wealth,
would be like offering music and splendor to a hungry beggar.
The results of these estimations can surprise only those, who can-
not comprehend what it is to have powers that cost nothing at com-
mand to an unlimited extent, and that it is the power that does the
work and not the tool (or machine).
The maximum of time employed for cultivation of land in the
climates with a winter is, as stated, only six months of the year.
The other six months will be left for accomplishing any other work
of the Satelite.
MODES OF APPLICATION.
The best mode of applying this system will at once appear to
any mind not stupified by the prejudices of custom, from comparing
the different estimations stated. None, but a fool, will choose of two
things the worst and the most costly, when the difference of both is
shown to him. It is manifest from the foregoing six estimations,
that the largest scale affords the greatest advantages, and that
prairies afford much sooner the maximum of profits than any other
land, which is previously to be cleared of impediments to perfect
agriculture.
However, the clearing operations may, and ultimately will, when
society is prepared to act on a large scale, be effected much easier
and with much less expense of time than stated in my above estima-
tion, viz : The trees may be pulled down and uprooted in rows, on
a tract of many square miles, then left for some years to dry, and
then be burned up at once in one general conflagration. There is
no timber required except for some few buildings, for which particu-
lar spots of woods may be preserved.
Still for the present generation, and for several generations to
come, there would be prairies or savannahs enough in America, if
they be preferred, and the other parts requiring more preparatory
works might be left for after ages.
But there arc farms and uncultivated tracts in parts of denser popula-
tion, that arc held at high prices—moreover the same are parcelled in
pieces of tens and hundreds of acres. The owners of such parcels
MODES OF APPLICATION-
. 47
and in such parts will like to know, what use of my system may be
made for their little farms. I have spoken as yet only of thousands
and tens of thousands of acres cultivable by one machine. People,
who are not in the habit of reasoning much, may rashly infer from
these my statements, that my system be not applicable to their
lands, and only qualified to rich owners of large tracts of land.
It is true, to supply every little farm of fifty to one hundred acres
with a stationary power or Satelite and connecting means between
them, would be as ridiculous as furnishing every spinster with a
card and spinning machine to spin her wool, or supplying a small
skiff with a little steam engine to save to one or two men the trouble
of paddling with their hands.
People, who never reasoned yet on what the advantages of ma-
chines consist of, are to be informed that no machine affords any
advantage, except by saving labour of men, and, next to it, that of
beasts. But as it is rather difficult to find a machine which will
have the goodness to work of itself, we have to find the poioer to
compel the machine to work. Now, if labour of men is required to
procure that po\yer, and labour of men to make the machine, and then
men to attend that machine in its operations, we have first to balance
the account of the expenses, that these labours and materials will
cost, with those of common manual labour to the same effect, in order
to find out which affords the best advantages, the machine or the ma-
nual labour,to do the business proposed. Now if three or four men can
cultivate a small farm without machines, there would be no great
advantage, if the same three or four men had to attend a machine to
do their work—they may then as well do it with their own hands.
Still there are ways and means to extend fully the benefits of my
system to the smallest farm and kitchen garden.
In a tract of 20,000 acres, for but one Satelite, may be found a
hundred farms, more or less, and out of them some farmer who is
either willing and able to establish on his little farm a stationary
power as described with one Satelite, or, if not, to sell or lease his
farm, for a good price to some speculator that calculates. A sta-
tionary power with one Satelite may thus be established in one or
the other way, sufficient for the cultivation and respectively prepara-
tion of 100 or more farms around. The operations may then begin
on the few acres of this farm. When they are finished, the next
neighbours may then be invited to look at them, if they should not
come on their own accord to behold the strange phenomenon. One
after another of them may then be asked, whether he would not like
to be freed of the trouble and expense to farm his land, and reap the
same benefit or more than he could effect with all his labour, his men
and beasts. The machinist might, for instance, propose to a farmer :
" I will cultivate your land as a garden, fence it (by ditches and
48 MODES OF APPLICATION.
dams) level it, provide it with ditches, irrigate it whenever useful,
clear it from stumps, &c, clear and change into a garden your
wood lands, as far as you desire, and improve your farm as much
as you see mine, for a certain share of your crops—you may name
yourself this share—and I warrant you as good crops as those you
see on my farm."
I think it likely some of the neighbours would not be quite so stub-
born as to resist the temptation, seeing in this proposition no risk, no
inconvenience, but only profit, and themselves rid of all labour, hard-
ships and inconveniences.
Thus by degrees the machinist would become the farmer of all the
hundred farms around his own little farm, to the profit of his own
and all his neighbours'; and every neighbour within his Dominion
would soon think it as foolish to farm himself his land, as he now
would think to build and attend a mill on his own farm for his mere
private use. What a miller with his mill is now to the farms around
it, the machinist with his stationary power and Satelite will be to the
cultivation, &c. of the farms in the neighbourhood. Those farmers,
if any there should be, who would prefer their old laborious custom
to farm, maj enjoy their privileges of staid customs, as long as Rip
Van Winkle slept before he awoke of his 20 year's sleep, till nobody
wants to pay their dear labour, but every body prefers to buy his
wants from the machinists at about — of the price Mr. Rip Van
Winkle's relation would ask.
Having now done with the difficulty of farming little farms and
highly prized land of less real value, by my system, it is now proper
to consider what is to be done in less difficult circumstances. I al-
lude to the 1,000 millions of acres which are to be found within the
United States alone, having no owners yet, except the nation at large.
There is then a choice of any suitable tract of land, for little or no
price. I shall not here speak of what laws or arrangements might
be made in regard to public lands—I have done it already in the
second part of my " Paradise." But viewing the circumstances such
as they now are ; it is evident at once to every one, that my system
is independent of the petty calculations of present settlers in new
countries. Their wants are anterior to their produces; and in my
system the produces and preparations of dwellings, &c. are anterior
to the wants of the settlers. Only half a dozen of men arc necessary
for the beginning in the first year—and the land produces enough
for hundreds of families, without requiring their labours, their long
privations of the finer social pleasures as now is the case with new
settlers.—All the machinists have to care for, is to choose the most
suitable place for the stationary power, with the best tract of land

around it, and then for the neighbourhood of some navigable water,
and the practicability of a road to it from the inland, in order to ex-
port their produces in great masses cheaply.
They will naturally look first to prairies, the cheapest, most con-
venient and most valuable for the cultivation by my system.
The owners of large tracts of wild land bought only for selling it
again, may avail themselves of my means in two ways, either by
cultivating them by my means and selling the* produces, or the im-
provements themselves, or by inducing settlers to cultivate the land
by my system, affording them a credit of the purchase price of the
land, and if they choose also the materials in part or entirely for the
machines, &c. on suitable conditions—by which they will enhance
the value of their land and the annual revenues of it for ever.
The speculators of capital may procure to themselves tracts of
land, such as are the most suitable to my system, and carry it into
practice upon it. They may either export and sell the produces in
mass, or induce people to settle on their .improved lands, by holdim;;
to them out good houses, and gardens, &c. for their use and profits,
by paying a certain amount of money per acre and house either
once for ever, or for any definite period, or annually—either in rash,
or in labour wanted on the establishment for its further enlargement
and improvement. This would be what land speculators generally
practise in laying out a certain tract of lots for houses, which lots
they then sell or let to the highest bidder. But there would be this
great difference, that the settlers would not merely pay for the per-
mission to build and to live on the lot, but for the dwelling, food and
other things and enjoyments to be derived from the establishment.
If there should happen to be any wealthy speculator, who, besides
making money for his own purse, should also be interested in the
moral and intellectual improvements of his neighbours, I have to
refer him to my " Paradise," which furnishes him ample materials
for it.
To tell to the wealthy how to get wealthier, and to the usurer how
to extend his usury to his heart's utmost desire, may seem to those
who are not in the happy position to make use of the advice, an
odious business. Still it is after all the wealthy or usurers that go-
vern the world, the republics as well as the monarchies and aristo-
cracies, since nothing but money or money worth can buy the good
will and respect of the people. I think, therefore, I owe to the
gentlemen usurers, (often misnamed speculators) the same respect as
common people do pay them, and have placed therefore them in the
first rank of my consideration, in speaking of the mode of appli-
cation of my proposed means ; for 1 think they will continue to govern
the world, ill or well, a few years longer.
After thus following the usual rule of good breeding, to pay :o those

of the highest consideration of my cotemporaries, the wealthy
usurers, the first compliment, before descending to take notice of
inferior ranks, I may be allowed to speak of the great bulk of the
people, the poor and labouring class, who, faithful to the command-
ment and " curse," " ea^ their bread in the sweat of their brows."
Those, who are not pleased with this " curse," and wish to get
rid of it, are then hereby informed, that it is now placed into their
power to become all wealthy and happy and free from any compul-
sive labour, even more so than any of their wealthy neighbours they
now may behold, who buy their exemption from that " curse" by
their money, the fruit of usury or something worse—they may all
live like ladies and gentlemen, even with better enjoyments, habits
and acquirements, than any of the rich ladies and gentlemen that
now can be found to possess.—For the particulars as to these new
superior habits or acquirements, see my " Paradise."
If there are pious people, who think their conscience ought not to
allow them to deviate from that " curse," I beg leave to inform them,
that they always will remain at liberty to work or keep holy-days
just as they please. I hope there will be liberality of sentiments
enough among the people, to allow only, and not to compel them, to
keep every week seven holy-days instead of one. Nay, if they
should be at a loss to know how to fulfil this "curse," though
nobody nor themselves should want their labours and services,
I will serve them with my advice freely and from pure good
will. They may still volunteer their pious work ; they may, for
instance, dig a hole one day and fill it up the next, and so on through
life, if they phoose. Nor will they, in so doing, be without prece-
dents. Thousands of pious Christian souls have already even done
more, they have scourged and lacerated their own backs, to please
their Maker and expiate their sins. The fact is, I do think, as I have
already expressed in my " Paradise," people, who toil and drudge
all their lives, do it in consequence of their sin—the most grievous
sin that, man can commit—the sin of not reasoning—the only siu
which sinks man to the level of a stupid beast—and by which he
has effectually forfeited the Paradise. What is to beasts and to
men, who like beasts, do not reason, the beautiful half of the globe,
with a perpetual summer that might be a perpetual paradise of abun-
dance and delight, and is but a frightful wilderness of starvation
and conflicts—what are the mighty powers and productiveness of
nature to brutes and brutish men?—They cannot see the use neither
of one nor the other. The inferior half of the globe with a periodical
death of nature is chosen, which forces unreasoning men to perpetual
labour and conflicts, with the climate, and with their fellow creatures,
for the poor pittance of their wants, that nature supplies but scantily
there.
MODES OF APPLICATION. 51
What I have to propose here is again, like all the rest of my pro-
positions, nothing but an old practice (I take pains to avoid the un-
pardoned odium of novelty), only to more profitable purpose than
any yet, viz: "joint stock companies," accessible to the poorest
individual.
Look at my estimations B and D in regard to prairies.
As long as they be not bought away by land speculators or other-
wise disposed of by the government, they will be of the greatest
advantages.
A capital of less than $20,000 for 20,000 acres is required which
may be refunded within one or two years, f i" you divide this capital
in 1,000 shares, each share will be less than $20, and amount to
20 acres' property, and nearly the produces of 20 acres of the finest
garden culture annually, after less than 7 years, and within the first
2 years an insurance of the supply of the natural wants of life for
each shareholder and his family. These shares m; either
in cash into some good bank, or to some responsible person, or in
work on the land, such as will be required in the making of, and
attendance to, the machinery for the preparatory works and culti-
vation. One to three months may be the extent of the labour of a
shareholder, to insure to him, for himself, his assignees or heirs, for
ever, the produces of 20 acres, with a kw per cent's deduction for
administration.
Pay for land will not be necessary, either by obtaining, on appli-
cation, special grants of the government, or by buying it on credit,
as the capital for it will in a few years be but a small portion of the
annual revenues, as the estimations show.
If wood land is chosen, the full revenues will ultimately be the
same, but so many years later, as the estimations show.
All what is then to be done, is to take any of the joint stock com-
panies' regulation you think most convenient, for your pattern ; this
will save you even the trouble of thinking for yourselves—there are
plenty of them in the country.—You may have yours incorporated
by the government. A few meetings as preliminaries, an organisa-
tion of a company, perhaps then a further enlargement of it by
sending your subscription list to such persons you choose to accept
as partners—then selectien of land, by one or more persons, and at
last one director and three or four labouring hands, if you do not
choose the plan C or D, may be your executors—this is all the
business necessary.
As soon as sufficient land is cultivated, you may have your houses
built by the Satelite in the mode suggested, either of wood sawed by
stationary saw mills, or of stones sawed by the Satelite, or of bricks
formed and compressed by a great pressure, at the stationary
machines, into coherent bricks, without fire or water, as practised
4*
52 MODES OF APPLICATION.
already, or of vitrified sand and clay as indicated in my " Paradise."
Your houses may all be built in the corners between the circular
Orbits (as the figure shows of the Circuit) in beautiful groves of
orchards and shrubberies and pastures, through which places are to
pass all the lines of communications, the canals and roads. After
the preparatory works are finished, the Satelite is only 6 months (in
climates with a winter) engaged for the cultivation of the land, and
the other 6 months of the year it may be employed to construct dams
and roads from corner to corner around every Orbit. These roads
may at proper Stations, such as locality suggests, be divided, into
Sections. Each Section is to be at one end higher than at the
other, so as to form a gentle inclination calculated to cause any
carriage, placed on the higher end, to run by its own gravity down
to the lower end : there then the carriage may be pulled, by the
stationary power at the Circuit's centre, upon a steeper declivity to
the higher end of the next Section ; from whence it will roll again
down to the next Station, and so forth, from Station to Station, in
any direction desired within the Dominion. Wherever another
Dominion joins to it, the same conveyance may be through that
continued; and ultimately the whole country, in whatever direction
it possesses a line of Dominions, may have such roads, on which the
carriages move with any speed desirable by their gravity, which is
but the reaction of the stationary power applied for their raising at
the Stations.
These roads will thus bring any carriage to any place of the
Dominion or lines , of Dominions within, at most, 1000 feet.
There is then also superseded all use of animals.
Next to these roads, one navigable canal at least may pass through
the Dominion, fed by its reservoir, for the exportation to the next
navigable river or other water. Not only the produces, but also
small floats of logs may be floated to, and down, the next river.
These floats may be joined in any number and to any shape desired,
to form one great float at their entrance into the sea, and may be
disjoined into smaller ones again whenever required. These floats
may then be propelled by those powers, which I have shown for it
in my " Paradise," and be used for those other purposes stated there.
These floating islands may form then your secure and rapid
intercourse with the distant parts of the globe, to exchange with
them, for your surplus of produces, what you may want. You may
then collect all the materials for such botanical and experimental
gardens and museums, and all the objects, representative images and
books, of which my " Paradise" speaks, for your and your children's
information and use of every thing known in the world, and worth
knowing to every human creature. Then, and only then, when the
mind is stocked with the correct knowledge of the materials of the
MODES OF APPLICATION. 53
present world, will the time commence to reason on moral and
intellectual improvements.
The advantages of my system will be still far greater in tropical
climates. They will afford in their wet seasons water-power, without
the use of windmills, wherever there is some inclination of the
ground to admit of gathering water into elevated reservoirs. Since
it is known that fertility of soil is only constituted by heat and
moisture. In those climates a proper management by my system of
the rains during the wet seasons, any, even the most sterile places,
sandy deserts themselves, may be rendered as fertile as any soil, by
irrigation. There will then be a perpetual luxuriant vegetation of
the choicest produces of the globe, affording on one acre more
nutritious stuff than 50 in other climates. And in this region there
are yet many thousand millions acres uncultivated.
But this latter consideration is only addressed to cosmopolites, not
to mere local beings.
I might state many other things feasible by these means, but from
fear of crowding your mind with too many notions at once, that
might lead you to loose sight of the main objects I have shown, 1
omit those of less importance as yet.
For instance
:
You never thought of cooling the summer's heat down to a pleasant
healthy temperature, nor to heating your chilly winters, in your
rooms, by mechanical means. Yet, this may be done.—I take this
too, like all my system, from your own knowledge and experience,
of which you have yet made but poor, or no, applications. You
know, any hard body grows hot by rubbing its surface. Now, if
you take, for instance, two iron disks, put them together like two
millstones, and make them revolve upon each other, their friction
may make and keep them red hot, which you can do by my
abundance of powers that cost nothing. You are then at liberty to
heat your rooms and cook your victuals without consuming materials,
except an insignificant trifle of iron that may gasify by the process.
The same power may also cool your rooms. You know, com-
pression of air and then sudden expansion of it to its former state,
produces a momentary cold, enough to freeze water into ice. Thus
you may manufacture as much ice as you desire, stow it into your
ice-cellars, and cool from them not only your beverage, but your
rooms by air-draughts issuing from them through your rooms,
which, at the same time, will banish all troublesome insects from
your abodes.
It may occur to your mind that there are various small works to
be done in agriculture not mentioned by me yet. To describe them
all would be too tedious here, since the very inspection and practice
of my Satelite will suggest the ways to apply the Satelite for them.
54 REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM.
I might as well attempt to describe all the things that can be made
with a knife or axe to a person unacquainted with the use of iron.
For example, will you be at a loss to know how to dig out of the
ground and gather your potatoes, turnips and other roots and pulps,
without using your fingers?—Only look at the comb of my Satelite
—
make the tines of it a little longer if necessary, and place the comb
in a proper inclination to the ground, so as to hook into it and below
the potatoes, &c. which will then slide upon them to the upper edge
of the comb from whence they may drop into some large box behind
it in the frame of the Satelite, while the loose dirt may drop through
the interstices of the tines.
You may think of gathering green peas, beans, melons, pumpions,
cucumbers or any other fruit of vines from a large extent of ground.
Well, the Satelite suffices to do the business. While moving slowly
on high wheels above the plants, the conductor (or more persons)
may sit upon the Satelite (under a tent if they choose) and cut off
with an adapted pair of shears the objects as quickly as they see
them and drop them into a box on the Satelite.—When the fruits are
dry and hard, such as dry peas and beans, the vines may be mowed,
as described, with the Satelite, and then thrashed by usual thrashing
machines, like other grains.
You may think of cotton picking (in southern climates) and the
like operations.—This you may effect also with the Satelite as fast
as it can move—that is at the rate of 6 miles and upwards per hour,
while picking all the ripe cotton from 2 to 4 rods in front at once, and
leaving the other parts of the plants untouched. The cotton culti-
vation will be found useless when people will become rational enough
to make use of my proposed fabrication of pliant stuff for all usee
stated. In the meantime it may last for some years yet. Cotton
cultivators, who apply my Satelite, shall be supplied by me, at their
request, with a contrivance for cotton picking by the Satelite at the
rate of 300 to 500 acres per day with the use of but one man.
REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM.
Now, for the experiments.
But, pray, what experiments would you like to see?—Is it the
whole system, or only a part, and which part of it you would wish
to have ascertained by experiments?
—
I want to satisfy you with experiments. I am not like your school-
mas'' irs, who serve you with assertions to be received on trust and
authority. I acknowledge no other test or authority but that of
your own knowledge and experience, Let us come then to a fair
REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM. 55
understanding, and see what you want to have proved by experi-
ments of my system. There may be some things in it, that you
know and can see every day—such, of course, you would nol want
me to teach you by my experiments. Let us then sift these things
known by you as old practices, from those that you do not know
yet, in order to simplify the business of experiments, and extend it
merely to the latter (unexperimented) parts of my system.
As my system begins with windmills, we have to take them first
into consideration.
Well, do you doubt that wind will turn a windmill with some
power ?
—
If you do, apply to me and I will show you some in practice these
many years already. So this part is proved by experiment.
The next object may be the raising of water by windmills.
How to raise water with pumps or endless chains of buckets, &c.
by turning a wheel or shaft, is in practice these many years already.
If you think that something new, and to be tried yet by experiments,
I can gratify you with experiments of it in plenty, on your applica-
tion to me—other people have saved me the trouble making expe-
riments.
The next thing is a reservoir holding water.
I can easily satisfy you with experiments, with darns confining
water at canals, ponds, &c.
The reservoir of my system is to let its water run out and fall
upon a water wheel, to turn it.
Do you want to see an experiment of this? Go to your next water-
mill.
But probably these are( not the parts of my system—neither the
wind nor watermills, nor the raising, nor confining of water into
a pond—which you doubt, and want to see' the experiments of.
—
There are perhaps other parts of my system new and. strange to
you, which you cannot believe until you see the experiments of
them. Let us see and review every other part, that nothing may
escape to your scrutiny, in order to discover what requires yet to be
ascertained by experiments.
If there be no mistake in my stationary powers—nothing what is
to be ascertained first by experiments, but is ascertained—then we
have to look to the locomotive machine, the Satelite, that novel thing,
which has to perform so many wonderful things for you.
To move a carriage by turning its axletree with two wheels fixed
at it, is nothing new—you may see it every day done at a steam
wagon ; the turning of its wheels is produced by a vibratory (to and
fro) motion by means of a crank at a shaft turned by the steam
engine's alternate pushes—the same is done at my Satelite by alternate
pushes caused by alternate pulls of two ropes.
56 REVIEW OP MY SYSTEM,
If you think the contrivance of steam wagons for turning the
wheels better than mine, you are at liberty to choose them—you may
also see at my model how my contrivance works.—But if you want
to see experiments on that part, only look to steam wagons.
The moving ahead of my Satelite by alternate pushes is then
proved by experiments.
If you want to have an experiment to ascertain how by a lever
with a little strength a heavy wagon may be advanced—only take
a long stout pole (or hand spike) appty one end to some of the upper
spokes of one wheel, and near it against some point at the axletree,
and at the long arm 10 or 20 times longer than the other of it pull
with your hands ;
you will find, that it will turn the wheel, and
advance the wagon, without deviating from the course in which the
wagon is directed.
To learn by experiment the fact, that my Satelite can be steered,
you need only to think of the case, when a driver has to turn his
wagon out of a hole in the road—he will lift the hind part of the
wagon, with a hand spike or other lever power applied properly,
and shove it side ways—this is the same thing what at my Satelite
is to be done to turn it from its course, only that the lever is always
ready at its place and, by sticking against the gi-ound, will lift with-
out trouble the hind part of the Satelite, in its advance. You may
make the same experiment at the hind axletree of a wagon.
So the practicability of the advance and steering of my Satelite is
proved to you and me by other people's experiments, which we can
witness every day.
What is it then, that you can discover, to be proved yet by expe-
riments, at my Satelite?
Since its practicability as to its motion is proved by practice, it
must be in its operations that we have to look for experiments to
ascertain them.
First, you will notice its pricked cylinder. With all the strains
of my brains I can nothing else discover, but that its weight
will press the pricks into the ground and break its surface. I have
seen the same operation with pricked cylinders rolled over land by
horses, with some brushes fixed behind it, to clean the dirt from it,
without that I have reason to suspect that the ploughboy who directed
the machine, had learnt it from me. So you may have seen such
things also. If not, that experiment will cost you very little, if you
want it. Only take any log, hammer some pins into it, and a pin
at the centre of each of its ends, put your horse before it and do the
same thing as related. It may not be superfluous to notice to you
that the pricked cylinder is not very apt to glide on the ground
while its pricks are sticking in it and that it is revolving, and drag
along with it any thing attached to it—unlike the wheels at steam-
REVIEW OF 3IY SYSTEM. 57
wagons with smooth felloes on smooth roads. If you doubt this
effect, only hammer some pins into the felloes of a wagon-wheel,
turn it then, and see whether it will not make the wagon follow with
a heavy load.
The next object presented to your sight at my Satelite is the
ploughing. Do you require an experiment with your common
ploughs '?—Or you doubt, perhaps, the practicability of the row of
ploughs fixed at the Diagonal log, as shown in my Satelite?—If so,
you are at liberty to hang your ploughs in any mode you please at
the Satelite ; they will be dragged along with it and draw furrows as
well as when your horses drag them. So I hope you will consider
this matter as settled by experiments.
Then I suggest pulverizing the soil by a comb with knives.
Perhaps this is something new in practice. But you may compare
it to a common rake, with which you crumble and pulverize your
garden, after having digged it ; my comb or rake is only a little
longer, and cuts the clods a little better by its knives than the tines
of a rake. But if you had rather use your common harrow, you
may hang it at the Satelite, which will pull it as well as your horses
can do, so my pulverizing operation is the same as your plough-
boys know from their experiments.
We have to turn our attention then to the other operations of the
Satelite, to find what experiments there are required.
The sowing and mowing are practised already by machines in
various ways, consisting of a sort of carriages pulled by animals.
You may consult those practices then, and choose any of them, you
should find preferable to my contrivance. So you have also the
practicability of the sowing and mowing by machines proved by
old experiments.
But the gathering of crops by machines may not be found in
practice, since on a few acres of land it may not be deemed very
profitable to do that job by horses or other greater power, and to
perform it on thousands of acres, would require greater farms than
we can find.
My contrivance for it shows nothing but a common rake or broad
pitchfork with a receptacle behind it for receiving the straw or grass,
&c, while the Satelite is advancing. If you, while walking, shove
before you a pitchfork and with its handle a board on the ground
and under the swathes of a field of mowed grass or grain, you have
the same experiment on a smaller scale—a row in front of several
of such pitchforks and boards, is what the Satelite shows in one
piece. Though you may not have seen large
1
rakes drawn by horses
for raking grass, &c, this experiment of your own, if you think it
necessary, will prove to you the practicability of gathering crops by
the Satelite by experiments without expenses.
/
58 REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM.
The great business of the Satelite of making any excavation,
elevation or applanation of the ground—reservoirs, wells, canals,
ditches, &c.—is done either by a scoop or scraper, by an excavating
plough, or by a transversal or diagonal log at the Satelite.
The use of the scoop or scraper I expect you will not want me to
teach you by experiments of my own. You may see that every day
in full practice, if you go to places where canals, &c, are made.
First the ground is ploughed and then scraped or scooped by horses
or oxen. Since you know, now, that ploughing or breaking the
ground can be done by my Satelite, the scooping or scraping of the
loose soil is in this case, as easy as in any other case of old practice,
and a matter then of old experiments.
To shove loose crumpled soil off its place by a log is no great
novelty to you either, since that is often practised, accidentally or
designedly, with sledges drawn on soft ground, or snow in an oblique
or transversal way ; the ploughshare in turning the earth to the side
of the furrow does the same thing.
But if you wish to see an experiment in exactly the same way as
at the Satelite, just take a log, tie a rope at each of its ends, and pull
it transversely or diagonally to its course, through loose crumbled
soil, which will recede before- it, and, if struck in an oblique direc-
tion, as it is with the diagonal log, it will be shoved to the side of the
log.
The excavating plough to raise the loose crumbled soil two feet
high to a bank close by it, is a thing of old practice. A shovel-
plough, shoving the earth out of the furrow at both sides, will make
already a ditch and raise the earth one foot or more.
So all the Satelite's operations of scooping, scraping, ditching,
canaling, forming dams, roads, reservoirs, wells, are proved by old
experiments.
1 come now to the novelty of sawing on the spot of growth by the,.
Satelite. Here let us first consult the common practice of one or
two hands sawing with a cross cut saw. All they have to do is to
direct their saw to the spot of the intended incision and shove it to
and fro in a straight line.
I request the same thing in the sawing at the Satelite—only the
hand needs not push or pull the saw, which is done by the machine's
arm holding the saw—so while it saves the exertion of the human
arm it may at every time, give a long and strong pull of more effect
than that of 10 or 20 men. You are at liberty, in this operation, to
stick a two tined fork into the ground or the log at each end of the
cut so as to hold the saw blade between the tines and keep its direc-
tion without further assistance of the hand.
My arched saw, for sawing into the ground with a pendulous
REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM. 59
motion requires nothing else than what the other saw does ; only it
has this advantage, that its cut may indefinitely be prolonged.
At every sawing operation, in one or the other case, you can
make the Satelite, by its weight, and by pinning it (by hammering
one or two pins into the ground through some parts of the Satelite)
in any way to the ground, as firm as you please, as well as any
part of its sawing contrivance, instantly.
So, in this sawing operation, I have nothing else to show but
your own old practice of handling the saw, fi i ent.
To raise a hammer and let it fall by a machine, is so common a
thing as to be known to every person. Therefore, the hammer
of the Satelite has no claim to novelty either, and its raising and
falling is proved by experiment.
But "to pull down trees is perhaps novel to you. Well, let us see
:
To raise a pole with one end, at which is tied a hook, to hook a
tree, is nothing novel. But to pull powerfully enough at its chain to
make the tree come down, may be something startling to some of
you.—Did you never see how by a slow motion and a small power,
even that of a few men, a great resistance wae overcome, or a great
weight, even that of several hundred tons, was raised ? A house or a
large ship is sometimes raised up into the air suspended by a small
power. I lave you no idea of levers, and in what proportion its power
may be increased ? —Am 1 to instruct you, perhaps, that lever power
is increased in the inverse ratio of its motion ? —Suppose at the ends
of the Satelite's pricked cylinder instead of 3 cogs, 30, and the
balances for pushing against them so proportioned, that at each
ropes' pull but one cog is moved—the motion of the Satelite will
then be 10 times as slow, its power consequently increased (for its
advance) 10 times, and, if 50 horses' power are applied, that power
will then be equal to 500 horses' or 5000 men's. So you may
increase that power as much as you please.
Or are you, perhaps, afraid the Satelite will not move, but give
away on the ground 'I Do you not see the many shovels or anchors
at the pricked cylinder sticking in the ground as deep and broad as
any ship's anchors ?—And to what power does not one ship's anchor
resist ?
Or are you afraid the chain for pulling will tear ? —Well, you are
at liberty to make it strong enough, or double, triple, &c, it. And
if you are afraid of the price for that material, take any thin log, or
pole, (say from 2 to 6 inches thick,) prolong it as far as required by
tying others to it by rope-yarn or cords as sailors do, and substitute
it to the chain. They will not tear asunder. If you do not know the
strength of these materials, any informed individual can instruct you
of it, or you can test it yourself by an experiment which costs you
nothing but a little stick, for instance, i to ^ inch thick, which you
60 REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM.
I
may hang up at one end and tie at the other as much weight, in-
creasing it by little and little, as will tear the stick asunder. This
operation of pulling down trees is then proved by experiments amply.
As I have now named every part and every operation of the
Satelite and shown of it, that it has been in practice long ere this,
and thus proved by ample experiments, where is then the novelty
which I have yet to prove to you by experiments ? It cannot be in
that strange thing, which I call the Satelite—for, as you have now
seen, every particle of it is old and in practice. —Nor can the novelty
to be experimented be in those parts composing my stationary powers,
as I have proved before.
Perhaps it is in the connecting means, between the stationary
power and the Satelite. It is certainly most important to ascertain
this part of my system. Let us then be most exact in the examina-
tion of these connecting means.
They consist in two different parts, viz. 2 ropes sweeping above
the ground without touching it, while the Satelite is moving in the
Orbit around its centre—and 2 chains of wires or poles lying on the
ground in straight lines.—The one and the other are alternately
pulled to and fro some feet (20 or more).
The said ropes are in their minimum but a few (50 to 100) feet
and in their maximum 1000 feet long, and at proper intervals carried
by light carts.
The wire chains are in their minimum 1000, and in their maximum
4000 feet long, and may lie on rollers or wheels at proper intervals
to diminish friction.
Do you want to see now the proof by experiment, that, when the
ropes ai'e pulled at one end sufficiently, the other end will pull too ?
—
Or, when one end of the chain on the ground is pulled sufficiently,
the other end will pull too 1—Or, when one end of the ropes is pulled
above ground sufficiently and the other end be attached to some
thing, the ropes can be tended and raised enough so that they do
not touch the ground?
If you want to see the experiment, with ropes kept above ground
while pulled at a distance of from 100 up to 1000 feet, go and look
at canals and rivers where boats are towed by horses or men walk-
ing on the bank. At rivers the tow rope has often to be extended to
several hundred up to 1000 feet, without being supported between the
boat and the towing animals, on account of shallowness of the river
near its bank or other impediments, and still the rope's end at the
boat pulls as well as its other end on shore is pulled. My supporting
carts are, therefore, not necessary, but only a facility, in imitation
of the rope at flying bridges, where the one end of the rope is at-
t
tached at a fixed point, the other at a ferry boat, and the rope be-
tween is supported by intermediate skiffs, to prevent its touching the

Mjrface of the water, while sweeping over it ; its length is to be more
than half the width of the river, consequently in some cases of much
more than 1000 feet.
The one part of my connecting means, as to ropes, is then proved
by experiments.
As to the other part of them, the chain lying on the ground, I can
gratify you with experiments too, if you will take the trouble to go
and look at any rail or other road, where wagons are pulled up hill
by ropes or chains lying on the ground (on rollers too) to the
distance of even more than mine (4000 feet). If you will not take
this trouble, you may tie together a number of thin poles (£ to 1 inch
thick) at their ends, until they form thus a chain of such a length
as wanted by me, from 1000 to 4000 feet, and pull sufficiently at
one end, and see whether the other end will not pull too if some
thing is attached to it.
This second part of my connecting means is then proved by ex-
periments too.
And thus the whole contrivance of my connecting means, has, al-
ter all, no novelty in it, but consists only of two old practices, viz.
the pulling of ropes above ground 100 to 1000 feet long, and that of
chains on the ground 1000 to 4000 ieet long, all proved by experi-
ments.
I have thus proved to you by experiments the practicability of
windmills,
raising water,
confining water in reservoirs,
watermills,
advancing the Satelite by alternate pulls of ropes,
steering the same,
revolving and keeping clean the pricked cylinder,
breaking the surface of the ground by the same,
ploughing by the Satelite,
pulverizing the soil by the same,
sowing, mowing and gathering the crops by the same,
scooping and scraping loose soil by the same,
shoving loose soil out of its track or into deeper places in it,
excavating small ditches and raising earth 1 or 2 feet high by
a plough at the Satelite,
sawing wood and stones above and within the ground, by the
Satelite,
hammering to batter rocks, and break loose earth, roots, &c,
pulling down trees and small roots and stones out of the ground,
by a hook at the Satelite,
transferring power to the Satelite by ropes above ground from
a distance up to 1000 feet.
62 REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM
transferring power from stationary machines by chains of poles
or wires on the ground up to a distance of 4000 feet.
This is all I pretend to do by my system.
I have then proved my system, to its full extent, by experiments
of many years.
I have thus availed myself of your own knowledge and expe-
rience—so there can be no dispute about my proofs. I have shown
in my whole system nothing else but what has been in practice these
many years. So I have taken from the mind the freight of novelty,
this bug-bear of lazy, stupid souls, who do not inquire nor reason,
and mistake that for caution what is but apathy of mind. They are
like a flock of sheep when they have to pass over a bridge—none of
them will dare to advance, in spite of dogs and all the driver's
exertions, until one is taken by the neck and pulled over it—then
one after another will follow of themselves—they are all for seeiag
first the experiment—but will not reason.
After I have taken so much pains to avoid introducing to you any
thing else but what is an old practice of yours—you are now at
liberty to sav, that I have invented nothing new, and that any one
of you might have done the same thing. So any kitchen woman
might have said at the introduction of steam engines :
" See the
cunning men ; they have availed themselves of my old experience
—
I knew long before that my pot if tightly closed would burst, though
of iron, by the force of steam from boiling water in it. Now, they
have but made a somewhat larger pot, with some valves, pipes,
pistons, shafts, wheels, cranks, screws, &c.—all things which I have
seen and known before as well as they."
Yet though some people, with some attention to what I have stated
before, should discover at last, that all things I have expressed, arc
feasible by means that are in practice—they may now say: "Oh,
granted, that these things are feasible, your system may cost per-
haps much more, and effect much less, than you have calculated,
and then after all be of no profit."—My answer can only be then :
Examine my calculations, derived from facts of your own experience,
and see whether and where I be mistaken.—" Oh, I care not a fig
for your calculations"—may be then their reply.—Indeed, if you
care not for my calculations, then I am at a loss to know how to
communicate and to prove to you any thing at all. What would
you think of a fellow, who should buy of you 100 bushels of corn,
or 100 yards of stuff, each at the rate of one dollar, and, on making
out your bill to him of 100 dollars, the fellow would serve you with
the same answer :
" Oh I care not for your calculation—I am all
for practice—I shall pay you one dollar as often as you give me one
bushel of corn, or one yard of stuff." I have to notice to you, if you
did not perceive it yourself yet, my case is exactly parallel to that case.
REVIEW OF MY SYSTEM. 63
I have given to you for my calculations all the simple facts that are
in your power to ascertain as exactly as you please, without expense.
The measure of wind and water power for 1 horse's power in square
and cubic feet respectively—the measureof 1 horse's power for plough-
ing and other agricultural works—thence the power required for the
purposes stated and the quantity of power required for hours, days and
months—thence the number ofwindmills, the size of the reservoir, of
the water-wheel, ofthe machinery to be used—thence the strength and
weight and expenses of the materials to be applied—the tra"ck of the
Satelite's operations, its march for hours and days in rods and miles
—and the resulting amount in acres per hour, days and years
—
thence, at last, the expenses and profits according to usual expe-
rience.—All these simple facts of your own experience you may
find either correct, or below, or above my statements—you may
ascertain every one, on which 1 have based any of my calculations
—
every one of them requires but the steelyard, or the yard-stick, or
the mere looking at some of the every day's practices pointed out by
me. All these calculations require no more than simple addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division, which every school-boy
learns.—So it is in your power, if you can read and cypher at all,
and understand the meaning of the most common words of your
mother language, to ascertain any and every one of my calcula-
tions as well as in any of your common dealings. When you have
ascertained the time for one rod or one acre of a certain operation
of my Satelite, cannot you calculate thence as well as I, how much
time in hours, days, &c, it will take for so many more rods and
acres ?—Suppose you would like to know how much time it would
require with the Satelite to clear 100 acres, or any other number:
examine on the densest spot of your woods how many trees there
are on one square rod, or one acre—how many cuts every tree in
an average would require to be removed in convenient pieces—how
much time it will take for sawing each cut by hands, when laying
on the ground—how much less time a cut may require when having
as much power for it as desired—could you then not compare the
facts, thus ascertained by you, with mine?—If, then, your facts turn
out to be below or above those stated by me, and how much this
difference may amount to, could you not then rectify accordingly
my calculations ? They may, in some circumstances and localities
be more, and in others less, favourable, as I have mentioned in its
place.
When you will have made yourself acquainted with all the things
stated, you will not be astonished at the necessary consequences of
my calculations. Silly people are astounded to hear, that a steam
wagon can travel 1000 miles in 24 hours, while they would not
think it a very difficult matter to move it 1 mile in 1| minute, or 40
64 CONCLUSION.
miles in 1 hour. So they will likewise find it utterly strange that a
thing not much wider than one rod should plough 200 acres in a
day with one man only for its guide—they will find it still stranger
that the same thing should perform the ploughing of 100 times 200
acres, or 20,000 acres, in 100 days—but they would find it not very
wonderful to move a thing 4 miles in one hour under the guidance
of one man. The reason of this silly inconsistency is, they do not
calculate.
CONCLUSION.
I have now finished my proofs of my mechanical system—I have
shown the abundance of inanimate powers that may be had freely,
their change into constant ones for ever, for any place, to any amount
—I have shown the tools for these powers to multiply and prepare
the very substances of life—the many thousand millions acres of
uncultivated lands of the best soil and climates, enough for the wants
of 1000 times the human population on earth—I have proved all
this from the well ascertained knowledge of the age, from the most
common practices of every day—I have in the last Review taken
pains to show that I have invented no new things, but only combined
a few old ones—I have taunted, at every item of my proofs, the world
to show any error or deficiency of my proofs, of my simple facts
and mathematical deductions therefrom—I have applied to society at
large, and to the government of the United States since 7 years, to
examine my propositions.—1 have begged every association, that
professes any purpose for the good of mankind, or for any portion
thereof or for their ownselves, to examine what 1 proposed and offered
in my " Paradise."—I have called there upon every individual that
claims the rank of man, to examine what I proposed and offered.
—
I have shown the contrast between the condition of man such as it is,
and such as it can be made by my means,—I have pointed out the
true and undeniable sources of the evils of man, especially in civili-
zation, such as it is—the first causes, want and fear of want, of all
the evils in society, that generate all the conflicts between man and
man, the injustices and retaliations—the universal poverty of pos-
sessing less than desired, where none is rich enough to desire not
more or think his wants secured.—Thence the universal scramble to
appropriate to one's self the produces of other men's labours, and to
escape to the necessity of doing the disagreeable labours one's self.
My system proves how this miserable scramble and universal
poverty and sufferings may be made to cease for ever.
What a stuff to the bitterest men hater and satyrist for his utmost
CONCLUSION. 65
hearts' delight, and to the lover of men, for his deepest grief, when
they see after this the futile efforts and vain boasts of the councils
of nations, of the leaders and teachers of society, of the voluntary
associations, or of any individual, of high professions of any bene-
volent or scientific purpose for relief and improvements, in the midst
of the chaotic conflicts of individuals, resulting from poverty or the
fear of it,—when they see devising one petty scheme after another,
to benefit some individuals to the injury of others—how they com-
pliment each other of their profound wisdom, enlightened humanity,
and the rapid progress of the age—or reproach and recriminate each
other with folly and dishonesty ?—while they pay no attention to
the undeniable things here exposed to their face, which would make
an end for ever of all these evils of poverty in the simplest infallible
manner
!
I have sought, and am seeking men to examine exactly my pro-
positions, that they may be enabled to judge on them, and make such
use of them as they see fit.
To whom shall I then apply ?
—
Whoever will show to me, in the wide range of the civilized world,
any government, or any institution, willing to examine, and to take
interest in, my system, for the benefit of themselves and of society
at large, is requested to do so, and may stipulate for his own benefit
as large a share in the reward he hopes from it, as he pleases, I shall
be liberal enough to him, and if he desires, I shall enter with him
into any compact tending to good purposes.
Whoever means to avail himself of my system merely for his
individual profit, is welcome to do it. In applying to me for any agree-
ment on terms analogous to the rate of 10 per cent, of the nett profit
accruing hereafter from the application of my inventions, I shall be
as liberal as any person could wish, that has not the will to exclude
me entirely from all benefits of my inventions and sacrifices made
for this great purpose. Models, or the machines themselves of any
scale, for any purpose stated in this book may be had on application
to me or my agents. I shall do my best to satisfy applicants.
But in whatever way or in whatever part of the world this system
will come into practice, the consequences will ultimately be the same.
I shall use the means coming into my power to accelerate these
consequences in the best mode I can think of.
Can any man in his sound sense conceive the possibility, that the
practice of this system, to produce and prepare the stuffs of life for
many thousands by 3 or 4 men and a comparative trifle of capital
will stop at the mere pecuniary gain of some speculators ?—Can any
person, capable of connecting logically two ideas together, expect the
businesses of life, the state of society, of the invididual man and of
things will remain the same as now among the mass of people, who
5
66 CONCLUSION.
see the practice and consequences of this system, and how all, even
the poorest of them, can reap the benefit of it for ever, that will supply
him and his family and friends, at least, with all the natural wants
and free all from odious toil and sufferings of poverty ?—Is it possible,
that the confined views and ignorance, of the mass of all nations
will remain the same as now, when leisure and means and new
chances for information on all general subjects are afforded to all,
not the mere information of letters, but of things, they can see and
handle and hear themselves 1 When they have once tasted a better
happiness, seen a larger horizon of the world with its things for
human life. Whatever once is known cannot be made unknown to
the world.
If any body will look beyond his little individual concerns to the
concerns of the mass of the people and of the age, he will easily
foresee now the next consequences of my system.
Our age wears features different from those of past ages. It is
not the fanaticism of superstition that now absorbs the minds and
feelings of the leading classes of the leading nations, as it was in
former ages, though the mummery of it may have some influence
yet in remote parts and on the low ignorant rabble. The mass of
the civilized nations turn their minds now more to the earthly im-
provements of life 1 It is no longer the broils and wars of nations
that engage the attention and desires of the great mass, nor of the
heads of their governments. They have learned by long experience,
that wars destroy, but never create—that even the most successful
conqueror has to pay more for his conquests than they will benefit
him. The mass of the people are no more so stupid machines as
to be used like dogs of a hunter, to be slaughtered for sport and glory
of a few individuals—they do no longer expect fortune in war.
They know they never gain any thing by it, but have to risk and
lose every thing, life, limb and property. But there is a revolu-
tionary spirit fomenting from one extremity to the other throughout
all civilized nations. They all want a change for the better of the
state of things and men. Civil wars and revolutions are on the eve
and have been breaking out from time to time. They are dreaded
—
the man of property fears the plunder. This is the sole cause that
checks them yet. The mass of nations seek now their salvation in
the mere change of governments and of men for their leaders. The
machines in some branches of human labours, begin to deprive some
labouring classes of the miserable pittance of sustenance.
—
Revolution
is the watchword. The people are like the wild animal, that is caged
or tied to a stake by a string. It will run madly all around, again
and again, mistaking its liberty to move to the right and left for the
liberty to escape—ever and anon seeing before its eyes no escape,
and hoping to find it at one or other side, forgetting again and again,
CONCLUSION. 67
that it tried its escape already at every point all around its cage or
stake. Of what avail is any social reform, when the desires for the
requisites of happiness of the individual must remain unsatisfied ;
when the contentment ofpoverty is demanded as a virtue or a necessity,
while the rich neighbours tantalize the poor—when wealth is con-
sidered as the highest good, and denied to the mass—when the rich
deem labour a suffering and a disgrace, and claim it from others
—
when in all forms ofsociety devised, the labours and services of men
for others are deemed unavoidably necessary, while every member
of the society wants more of them from others than he is willing or
able to do himself. What is all the claimed or boasted liberty and
equality of political rights, when every one, with the exception of
perhaps a few very rich individuals, must buy (more or less) his
wants of life by his servility and labours, and be glad for the chance
of it, when he must remain for ever very limited in the possession of
means for his desired and desirable enjoyments ?
Let my system be known to those poor struggling masses, who
seek amelioration of their condition in some change of mere govern-
mental or social forms and leaders—and what will become of their
revolutionary ideas and desires ?
.
It is for you, you leaders, real or imaginary ones, of revolutions,
to think of that now—and you will see a much more glorious field
for your activity before you, than any sterile change of governments
and social forms.
It is peace, wealth, happiness, not at the expense of your fellow
creatures, but by creative means applied to the, as yet, unused rich
resources of nature, you have to look for, and which is here plainly
before you.
Study, for once, the creative means within your reach, they only
will, and can, be the glory of a more intelligent age. Your present
destructive means, that hitherto have absorbed the mind, will soon
cease to be effective, and the heroes of mere destruction will obtain
that rank of mankind which is due to them, the rank of mere
barbarous brutes—100 intelligent men will defeat all the glories and
heroisms of mere sanguinary military chieftains—and do more than
armies of millions, whose soft flesh and bones cannot resist to a few
small unfeeling machines driven by some of those gigantic powers
of nature, (pointed out in my " Paradise,") on land or on sea, and
renders all bloody heroism abortive, and wars impossible.
Do you not see these means yet, and will you ask them of me
too?—
Show me first a rational society, worthy of them, and I can
accommodate you with them too.
What do I mean by rational society 1 Why, simply this :
The first society that will be something like rational, will cer-

tainly not employ one thousand men for what can be done by one
man. Therefore, one Satelite with four men will keep the land in
the highest state of improvement, including transport and houses,
for a population of 100,000 individuals. One foundry will supply
all the hard parts of machineries and utensils, with three or four
men.
—
One small establishment will supply the same population
with all pliable stuffs wanted for all purposes of that kind. There
will be no spinning, weaving, sewing, or any other of the tedious
processes now in use, but all the articles of pliable stuff, for whatever
purpose, made like paper now is made, only with other ingredients
and some additional operations. For each article of hard or of
pliable stuff is but one type required for a whole country.
These three different simple means will then be the only ones for
supplying man with all his physical wants, requiring about 10 men's
attendance for the wants of 100,000 men. The business of life will
then consist in social, moral and intellectual pursuits, in the enjoy-
ments for which life is made, and as my " Paradise" indicates.
It is then that this rational society will make the most rational
use of all the fine and coarse things that now exist, and which
occupy and absorb the activity of man. They will then carefully
collect them, at least one piece of each kind, and place them con-
spicuously in their museum for instruction to their children. " Look
here, dear children," they will say then, " these are the produces
of our ancestors ; who thought themselves very enlightened."—See
what pains they took to acquire so much skill as to make them, and
then what use they made of these produces.—See here a coat of
many cornered patches, sewed together in a particular manner
;
you may count many days before you can finish the counting of all
the stitches, there are some hundred thousand stitches at this little
coat—it is made of many thousand fine threads, and protects neither
against wet, nor heat, and very poorly against cold ; it soaks, rather,
the water in—they wore it only for show—and most people were
eager to possess several of such coats, of different colours and make,
for different occasions, and thought themselves only then to be decent
people.—See here the other pieces of similar construction for one
suit of dress.—See there a little golden chain and watch, to show the
time of day, nearly, of which they made a very unprofitable use.
This trinket would cost as much as the work of a whole year of one
labourer, working every day 12 hours or more, to get enough to
eat and sustain life against the inclemencies of weather. —See here a
string of pearls ; they would cost as much, or more again, though
there is no use, nor art, nor work whatever at them ; but you have
to know, little children, your ancestors could not procure them,
except in a very small quantity, and with much risk of life of divers,
who fetched them from the bottom of the deep sea. Though glass
CONCLUSION. 69
pearls would do the same service, and could be had for a very small
trifle ;
yet your ancestors thought themselves too intelligent to give
the preference to what they called worthless things.—See here other
trinkets for show or ornament of gold, silver and jewels. As much
of them as you can hold in one of your little hands would have made
the fortune for life of any of the many millions of poor people, and
liberated him from compulsive labour and made him respected
—
they were of no use whatever, but your ancestors, who thought they
understood the value of things well, would give as much for them as
would feed and clothe, and shelter a family for 50 years and longer.
They would give their houses, lands, produces, and many years'
labour, any thing dear to them, even their children and wives, to
obtain a handful of these precious useless trinkets. You have to
know, that these precious trifles could only be found deep in the
earth and in small quantities; therefore, they required very much
labour and patience to find them. Glass, or any other yellow or
white glistening little thing, that could be had for almost nothing,
might have done quite as well for the purpose. But your ancestors
scorned them, for they thought themselves very wise. And because
they thought themselves wise, they killed those people, who inhabited
such countries, where these little glistening things could be found, in
order to rob them, and compelled many thousand other people to dig
deep holes into the earth, to find more of those valued things, not
minding much what grew on the surface of those lands, which could
make so many millions of human beings happy.—Look here, the long
knives and guns, with which they used to kill each other, because
they thought that very glorious.—Look there, some pieces to put
some of their little things on or into them. Here is a table of wood
with boxes, composed of rare and therefore highly valued stuffs, and
joined together with much art and labour—it would cost as much as
a house for a family. There is a box of many little boxes, similarly
made, and equally valuable, to put their little things in it.—See here
are many other things of similar make, use and value.—The owner
of such things would pride in the possession of them very much, and
feel himself very unhappy, if he had to do without them, because
they would cost the labour of many men for years, though tables,
chairs, boxes of cheap wood and make, that would hardly cost one
day's labour of one man, would answer quite as well the use. See
here a model of a big house, with 50 rooms, large enough to hold
100 people or more. It would cost the value of 1000 men's labour
for one year, or the labour of one man for 1000 years. It was owned
by but one man, who would now and then use it with a number of
his servants, men and women. Its value in labour would have been
enough to feed, clothe and shelter 500 men for life, though the house
would in our days not be good enough for storing our lumber.
70 CONCLUSION.
Although their houses cost them such immense labour, they were
built chiefly of wood and other combustible materials, and many
thousands of them close together, which they called cities, inhabited
promiscuously by all classes of people in tens of thousands—they
were in consequence subject to frequent conflagrations, caused by
the least inadvertency in the use of fire, or intentionally for stealing
or from revenge, destroying the houses by hundreds and thousands,
together with all the moveable wealth they used to store in them, and
which they appreciated so dearly, even more dearly than their own
lives.—See here a model of their best ships. Such a vast hollow
building, with such a thin wooden wall, was nearly as breakable as
a bottle of glass. Even a little hole would sink it. It carried, as you
see, long poles, with many patches of expanded sails, held by many
ropes. It took a long time for many men to climb upon these things,
and adjust so many patches, with much danger of life. So, some-
times, when high winds shifted or rose suddenly, they would capsize
the ship, or tear poles and sails to pieces, before the men could take
them in. These frail things would be sunk at any touch upon some
hard thing under water, and the men be drowned ; for they did not
think even of providing themselves with boats incapable to sink, for
saving their lives. From bad food and putrid water in the ship's •
hold they engendered pestilential diseases, and spread them over the
land at their arrivals.—See here some of their books, used every
seventh day in their meetings, held for the purpose of being told that
they were a very sinful and foolish people, and that they ought to
be good and wise—but when they were offered the means for
enabling them to become better, wiser and happier, they would scorn
and ridicule them as impossible things without investigation, believing
what their teachers used to tell them, that the world was made to be
wretched.—They laboured from morning to night, from day to day,
from year to year, through life, to make such trifles as you see here,
in order to buy with the money of their sales other trifles from other
people. They spent all their skill to produce their trinkets and things
of little or no utility, but have left to us no indication, whatever, of
any ingenuity or endeavour to produce the things that make human
life happy.—See here their poor tools, which they took into their
hands to use the strength of their feeble arms for cutting their trees
and stones, for digging and ploughing their lands, and reaping and
preparing their crops—the axe, the hand-saw, the spade, the plough,
the sickle, and others—it took, therefore, a man's lifetime to do the
work of necessity and utility for a family's meanest sustenance and
comfort. It required ten labourers and servants for one man to live,
what they called decently, and 100 to be respected by all classes of
the people. One man would have a number of cooks, waiters,
grooms, and other servants, besides the makers of their dress,
CONCLUSION. 71
harness, carriages, tables, seats, boxes, and an innumerable host of
other working people, occasionally employed for him. They would
with all this live a very uncomfortable, unhealthy life, shortened by
disease and mental excitements, in consequence of bad food and
drink, and lodging and dress, and sufferings and vexations, from
envy, fraud, and offences of their friends and servants. You
behold here, little children, all the variety of things, of which you see
no more use, nor we either, than that of pebbles and straw, for which
our ancestors toiled or fought through life, and which they valued
above all things.—It was for such poor objects that one nation
plundered another, that they destroyed reciprocally their lives, their
produces, their houses, their cities, which had cost them so much
labour. It was for these glistening little bits of yellow and white
metals and pebbles, that they underwent the most perilous sea
voyages in their miserable frail vessels, to plunder distant parts of
the globe of them, and when they found them, killed millions of the
native inhabitants, and made other millions slaves, to work in these
new discovered countries for such trinkets. These are the things
they called wealth and luxury, for the acquisition of which they
preyed upon each other in peace and in war—they had many laws
and prisons, and all manner of frightful punishments for poor robbers,
while they worshipped, as great men, those who robbed and killed
the people by thousands. Every one's business through life was
to buy as cheap as possible, and to sell as dear as possible—which
they called an honest way of living, while none cared for the suffer-
ings of his neighbours ; for every one, or every family, lived sepa-
rately, and watched what little they possessed with as much anxiety
and excitement as a dog will watch a piece of meat in his paws when
other clogs approach—for none had enough for himself.—Their
jealousy and distrust to each other would not allow them any union
of many individuals, except in the works of destruction and revenge
in wars, when they compelled each other to fight for their own
defence, or could make up money enough to pay hired robbers and
men killers. They could not conceive how any great thing for the
good of all members of society could be effected ; and lived sepa-
rately, each family or individual, like helpless savage animals, while
the beautiful half of the globe was but an uncultivated wilderness,
capable of producing the wants of 1000 times the population on
earth.
What would you say to all this ?—Is it, perhaps, an exaggeration
or fiction ?—Or is there not rather a plain reality in it, which, to
dispute, will baffle all sophistry 1

ADVICE TO CRITICS.
Ye, who have assumed the high function of enlightening the public
on all subjects, this matter ought to be a glorious chance for you to
exercise your learning and talents to some great good purpose, and
justify the confidence reposed generally by the public in your judg-
ment and candour.—Your honour is at present at stake ; therefore
I would friendly advise you, to examine first carefully before you
venture to give your judgment on the subject. For your name and
true character, good or bad, will* thereby become known to the intelli-
gent portion of the present generation and to posterity hereafter. If
your object is your own honour, and the good of mankind as far as
it be in your power, I need not tell you what course you have to
pursue in any of your critics on this subject—a most careful exami-
nation of this mathematical subject and a candid acknowledgment
of the result is all which is required—the same as any geometrical
demonstration would require, pointing out distinctly the points of it
that be not conclusive, or assenting to those which are demonstrated
—
it is but ignorance and very obtuse intellect that applies any vague
opinion to a mathematical demonstration, and confounds science
with mere indefinite opinion. But if your object is only the momen-
tary gratification of gaining the applause or mere laugh of an
unreasoning, uninquiring, and therefore easily to be duped multitude,
you have a very easy task. You may attain this object in various
ways, without deviating in the least from established custom, viz :
First, criticise only the style—take here and there some phrases
you think fit for the purpose, and measure them by your erudition,
dissecting them in the most cutting manner you can think of, and
fulfil thus your high vocation as a man of letters. I hope, for your
own pleasure and that of your readers, who may delight in it, that
those persons, who have the care of printing this book, will not
deprive you of that gratification by correcting my style. For I have
been very careless of it. My object was to be plain and intelligible
to every one, who desires to understand me—as to the others, I have
neither the good will nor the talent to make myself understood by
them.—I think, if somebody should receive, as a present, a bag full
of gold, he would care very little for the colour and texture of the
bag, and not be over scrupulous with examining the quality of the
bag, but turn his attention rather to the substance contained in it.
So I cared but for the substance of my book, to make its true value
plainly understood by the reader, and I defy any critic to prove that
to be false.
ADVICE TO CRITICS. 73
Besides the style you may easily venture any judgment you
please on the substance of the book, without putting yourself to the
trouble to examine, and consequently without understanding any-
thing of it. For instance, express your doubts on the practicability
of the system, by some general unmeaning phrase, a proverb, &c.
Say, for instance, that many a theory, more plausible than this,
proved to be false in practice—that perhaps something might be
found useful in it, but that you could hardly believe the possibility
of cultivating 20,000 acres by four men with one machine, and one
dollar capital per acre—that you are rather afraid the author has
made some miscalculation, and would find it rather difficult to apply
his or any other machine to clear woods and cultivate broken, rocky
ground—that the reservoirs, dams, &c, he speaks of, might cost
more than the supposed advantages of the machines, &c, &c.
Such insinuations look like modesty and prudence, and becoming
to a thoughtful gentleman, and are suitable to all events.—For if the
thing succeeds well, you will be found to have been in the right to
doubt a little—and if not, or any little difficulty, supposed or real,
should occur in the attempt for practice, your cautious judgment
will be deemed fully justified—and, in all cases whatever, your
sagacity and foresight will be admired, instead of suspecting you for
a dull, lazy, uninquiring blockhead.
To be more decisive in your judgment, you may indulge in the
pleasure to take out of the book, here and there, a phrase, that
expresses some great results of preceding demonstrations, as speci-
mens suitable to the most malicious sneers that your heart can be
capable of.—Say, for instance :
" Only look, myr
enlightened readers,
to novelties like this of a most presumptuous fool : he pretends to
know more than all the wise people that ever lived, and to teach to
old farmers how to clear their lands by wind—to plough 20,000
acres by wind or water-wheels, and three or four men only—and to
do such and such other marvellous things.—Such statements wear
on their face the stamp of the most ridiculous absurdity—and I will
not offend my intelligent readers with saying more on the subject,
and dismiss it as a product unworthy of further notice." Or, in
following the hint I have given, say : " The author himself allows
that he has invented nothing new, but he gives a few most exaggerated
calculations, not worth mentioning, to prove, that you and your
horses may now eat and drink and be merry or sleep, and work no
longer, since wind and water alone will do all your business, change
your woods into gardens, and make them produce the richest har-
vests, put them into your garners, and make the whole world a
paradise.—We declare that this vision beats all the visions we ever
heard of—but such trash will not do for our enlightened community
—
74 ADVICE TO CRITICS.
the people are too enlightened to be humbugged by buying such
books." You need not fear any bad consequences.
Suppose the truth should come to light at last, and your false
colour be discovered by seeing the machines in practice. Suppose,
even, some better-informed people should hereafter find in your
critic nothing but a common every day's silly blackguardism. What
could it matter to you ?—You stick to the majority—and if the
majority hereafter should change their notion on the subject and
find the invention after all a very useful thing—well, what then ?
—
you change then, too, with the majority, and extol the foolish thing
to the sky.—Do not be scrupulous about contradiction. You may
say, then, for instance, as others have used to say in similar cases
:
" We did not understand rightly the author ; he did not speak
plainly enough ; we understood he meant so and so—it was alto-
gether his fault—we meant no harm, and are not given to the study
of such things."—In siding with the majority you can never do any
thing amiss.—Nay, you may be chosen still hereafter for some
director of some Dominions of my system, as a person eminently
qualified for such business, and reap more benefit from my inven-
tions than ever I shall do.—To encourage you, if you should feel
too faint-hearted for committing such blunders or dishonesty in your
critics on this subject, I will cite a fair precedent for you of that
kind. It is stated, that Walter Scott, that great man, who wrote
such pretty stories, was at London when the gas light was spoken
of. Walter Scott, on his return to Edinburgh, being in company
of some very intelligent gentlemen lawyers, and of other learned
professions, told the novelty of pretending to lighten London by
coal smoke. He, and the intelligent company, broke out into a
hearty laughter at this piece of novelty. " Gentlemen," Walter
Scott observed, " I must confess such fools as this man with his
coal-smoke light, are worse than other fools—they are the most
stubborn fools, and cannot be dissuaded in any manner from their
monomania." Some twenty years thereafter Walter Scott was
chosen by the Edinburgh gas light company for their director.
The intelligent laughers at Robert Fulton's steamboats give you
another example of this kind.
Now, I assure you, that I give you these pieces of advice from
the purest sincerity of my heart, and shall not be displeased with
whatever course you will choose to follow.
For, in the first case, where you have to examine exactly the
subject before you judge and be candid—I shall conceive you
pursue what is right and honourable, and I am sure you will but be
respected for it, now, and hereafter, by every friend to humanity,
justice and science, and I shall be your friend too.
ADVICE TO CRITICS. 75
In the other cases, where you follow but the dictates of vulgarity
and ignorance, coupled with dishonesty, I shall be also pleased
with it—for in that case I shall not be your friend, nor conceive
any respect due to you ; and, then, the more disgrace you heap
upon yourself, the better I shall be pleased.
