  ABSTRACT:&nbsp;    This    study is a retrospective review of 318 NDErs responses to   questions about emotions during and after the NDE,&nbsp; and about relationships   after the NDE.&nbsp; Emotions are a common denominator between the physical reality   and what is experienced on the other side.&nbsp; The top emotions that are   experienced during the NDE are peace, love, and happiness.&nbsp; However, the top   emotion that is experienced upon return to the body is confusion.&nbsp; This paper   looks at the role of emotions during and after the NDE and the role that   emotions play in our earthly life.&nbsp;

  KEY WORDS:&nbsp;    emotions, emotional   healing, near-death experience

INTRODUCTION
  
  Emotions are those feelings that virtually   everyone has, but yet few understand.&nbsp; Understanding can come from a variety of   angles, but this paper will focus on memory, motivation, brain/mind processing,   and how emotions play a key role in the transformation process based on what   near death experiencers (NDErs) are telling us.&nbsp; People who are near-death   experiencers are people who have died or experienced an imminent   life-threatening event and subsequently come back to life.&nbsp; They come back with   a collection of memories that occurred during the time of death. (Long, Jody   2003).

Evolutionarily   speaking, emotions have served a very important role in survival of the human   species.&nbsp; The very make-up of our brain shows the evolutionary process.&nbsp;   Characteristics of the primitive brain, otherwise known as the reptilian brain   or the pons, are that it reacts out of instinct, reacts from the base, core   emotions (of which fear and anger are major components), and processes   information differently than the cortex (Ornstein, 1991).&nbsp; Information is   processed from habit, and is processed from the language of &quot;non-ordinary   reality,&quot; where images are dreamlike, interpretation is generally   individualistic (Wettech, 2000, p. 75).&nbsp; These are the emotional evolutionary   traits that kept us alive as a species.

Later, the mammalian   brain developed.&nbsp; The function of the cortex is to rationalize and to problem   solve.&nbsp; In a functional person, the cortex can control emotions if the emotions   pass the threshold of consciousness into the realm of the conscious.&nbsp; Many   times, though, emotions will operate on a subconscious level and we will only be   consciously aware of them by extreme situations that force us out of the   habitual operation of the pons; or if we are in a state of consciousness or   awareness that can override the cortex.&nbsp; &quot;During sleep, syncope, coma, psychotic   episodes, and hypnotic trances, portions of the cerebral cortex can be made   dormant, thus allowing the reptilian brain to become the predominant computer (Wettech,   p.75).&quot;

The way that we   process visual, auditory and tactile experiences is the sensory input is relayed   through the thalamus before it reaches the cortex (Jourdan, 1994, p. 186).

  This information is then sent to the cortical   area specific for each sensory organ, where it is analyzed and connected with   corresponding information from the other hemisphere of the cortex.&nbsp; Once   processed, that information is sent to the sensory areas, where it is integrated   and interpreted.&nbsp; Once there, these perceptions are modulated on the affective   and emotional level by projections to the limbic cortex (pp. 186-87).

A primary function of   emotions in the cortex helps us organize, store, and access information in the   brain.

  Recalled memory will be reconstructed using   the brain preference for order and stability.&nbsp; The memory will have a certain   order to it and will generally be re-told in a way that subjectively makes sense   to the individual.&nbsp; Analogous to a computer hard drive, we retrieve the memory   chunk of information, by accessing a particular emotional 'directory' in a   certain part of the brain.&nbsp; Then the memory chunk is connected to one or several   information chunks and the brain makes up the most logical story to connect the   separate information chunks.&nbsp; This means that the information is integrated into   an existing subjective framework of reality&nbsp;(Long, J.A., 2002).

A literature review   fails to show a consensus on how emotions interact between personality features   and behavior (Tiberi, E., 1993. p. 151).&nbsp; Some claim that emotion serves as a   primary motivational function in relation to both mental activities and   behavior.&nbsp; Some recognize the influence of emotions on memory, and therefore,   consider that emotions are the predominant factor over cognitive systems in   general.&nbsp; Still others will assign primacy to the cortex because it has the   ability to override the emotions through rational thinking.&nbsp; Tiberi concluded in   her study that the continuity of emotions, both in the waking, conscious state   and the out of body state implied that emotions were the key to showing   continuity and oneness between earth and what lies beyond. (p.169)&nbsp;

Tiberi's research on   the emotions while in the normal waking state, and while in the extrasomatic   (out of body) state is invaluable (Tiberi 1993).&nbsp; She categorized emotions by   the cause, the function served, the role of the body in controlling the effects   of the NDE, survival, and interpersonal relationships.&nbsp; Noteworthy, was that   positive emotions and affects seem to enhance memory and imagery.&nbsp; Serenity,   joy, peace and relaxation was key in remembering the experience.&nbsp; Feelings of   love were associated with the orderliness or ease of processing of the perceived   images. (p.160).&nbsp;

Those who experienced   fear during the experience were more likely to agree that emotions are helpful   in motivating, guiding or energizing behavior.&nbsp; They were more likely to feel   that emotions helped them adapt to the new situations, helped the mind reach   goals, and that these emotions cause unhappiness and therefore problematic in   integrating the experience in everyday life.&nbsp; Conversely, those who experienced   positive emotions were more likely to feel that these emotions make people happy   and were not problematic to integrate into every day life. (p. 161)

The information   discussed above gives one a background to look at emotions in the physical body   and the effect on memories.&nbsp; After considering what we know of emotions and then   looking at how this might interface with NDEs, the primary question in my mind   is twofold:&nbsp; 1) how does extra somatic emotion that occurs when the brain is   dead integrate physically when the body is brought back to life; and 2) what can   we learn about the role of emotions in the transformational process?

METHODOLOGY

This study is a   retrospective review of data received from an Internet survey on the Near Death   Experience Research Foundation (NDERF) website     www.nderf.org    (Long, 2003).1 Out of a total of 660 experiences submitted to the   website, 318 of these experiences met the research definition of NDE as defined   as, &quot;A lucid experience associated with perceived consciousness apart from the   body occurring at the time of actual or threatened imminent death&quot;&nbsp;(Long).&nbsp; It   was then determined which of the 307 NDErs answered the questions about emotions   and relationships.&nbsp; Four questions were analyzed for emotional and relationship   content.&nbsp; These were: 1) What emotions did you feel during the experience?; 2)   What emotions did you experience following your experience?; 3) What was the   best and worst part of your experience?; and 4) How has the experience affected   your relationships? Daily life? Religious practices etc.? Career choices?

A coding system for   the responses to each of the four open-ended questions listed above was devised   based on how NDErs responded to the question.&nbsp; The narrative results for each   question were tabulated according to words or concepts.&nbsp; Although one answer   might be scored in more than one category, there was only one experience answer   per each category.&nbsp; This is relevant because some people had many words to   describe their emotions, so may have counted in several categories. &nbsp;However,   only one NDE answer was counted in each category.&nbsp; For instance, one NDEr may   have answered, &quot;joy, peace, love, and safe.&quot;&nbsp; There would be one mark for this   particular answer in each of the four emotional categories of joy, peace, love,   and safe.

Consequently, it is   valid to compare percentages of participants who answer in each category with   the total population who gave narratives answers to the question.&nbsp; However,   percentages calculated using a cross-comparison between the categories would not   be valid.

RESULTS

Out of 318 NDErs, 172   (54%) checked the box that said their experience included &quot;strong emotional   tone.&quot;&nbsp; However, when asked to describe the emotions during the experience, just   about everyone 305 (96%) described what they felt.&nbsp; Moreover, NDErs generally   were very descriptive about their emotions during the NDE.&nbsp; There was a total of   937 emotionally descriptive words, or an average of three emotions for each   NDEr.&nbsp; Contrastingly, there were 287 (90%) NDErs who discussed emotions after   the NDE.&nbsp; Of the emotionally descriptive words used after the NDE (534), there   was an average us of two per NDEr.&nbsp;

The top positive   emotions during and after the NDE show some marked similarities and some   striking differences.&nbsp; The category of &quot;Peace/Calm/Tranquility&quot; was the number   one emotions both, during and after the NDE.&nbsp; All together, the categories of   &quot;Peace/Calm/Tranquility,&quot; &quot;Joy/Happiness/Wonderful, &quot; and &quot;Love&quot; were mentioned   far more than any other emotions.&nbsp; Although love was one of the most mentioned   emotions, the quality was very different when talked about during and after the   experience.&nbsp; Qualifiers used during the experience were those such as &quot;Love   times 1 million&quot; and &quot;Indescribably loved so much.&quot;&nbsp; However, when they talked   about love after coming back, they did not have the intensity or qualifiers that   were used when discussing emotions that occurred during the experience.&nbsp;


  &nbsp;

The top negative   emotions during and after the NDE show some marked similarities, but it appears   that the emotional differences seem to be integration-related.&nbsp; There is a wide   gap between why someone may have felt scared during the NDE as opposed to fear   on earth.&nbsp; Fear on earth could be related to sanity, a negative experience or   life review on the other side, or fear could be from being ridiculed or rejected   for telling their story.&nbsp; There is no number one emotion both, during and after   the NDE.&nbsp; All together, the categories of &quot;Fright/fear/scared/horror/terror,&quot;   &quot;Confused/uncertainty,&quot; and &quot;Sadness/sorrow&quot; were mentioned far more than any   other negative emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


  &nbsp;

There were 76 (26.4%)   of NDErs used the same word to describe emotions during and after the   experience.&nbsp; Contrarily, 124 (43.2%) NDErs whose description of during and after   emotions were totally opposite of each other.

There were 292   (91.2%) NDErs who answered the question, &quot;what was the best and worst part of   your experience?&quot; When looking at the best part of the experience, the largest   group consisted of positive emotions (30.14%) such as peace, calm, love,   happiness, joy wonderful, comfort, warmth, safety, compassion.&nbsp; The next   category was the beings (24.32%) that they met and the attached feelings upon   seeing the being of light, God, Jesus, spirit helpers, reunion with relatives or   others.&nbsp; The third category were those emotions attached to dealing with death,   most commonly lack of the fear of death and knowledge that there is an afterlife   (15.41%).&nbsp; A lot of comfort came from making sense out of what happened.&nbsp; NDErs   used words such as purpose in life, knowledge, understanding, wisdom,   acceptance, faith (13.7%).&nbsp;

A prime category had   to do with greater awareness and interaction with others, of which I have   labeled &quot;spiritual growth.&quot;&nbsp; The descriptive words are positive changes in my   life, awakening consciousness, relating the experience to others, support and   prayers of others, helping others, oneness, connection (10.62%).&nbsp; Some mentioned   that experience factors were the best part of the experience (8.56%).&nbsp; These   factors included that the experience happened at all, flying, floating, the   void, beautiful place, and utopia.&nbsp; Another set of factors I labeled as &quot;lack of   earthly constraints.&quot;&nbsp; Factors falling in the category had to do with freewill,   freedom, no fear, and no pain (6.51%).&nbsp; Those that were grateful for a second   chance or who were now curious enough to discover more comprised 5.82% of the   answers.&nbsp; There were 7.53% who thoroughly enjoyed their experience and said that   there were no bad parts to their experience.

On the other hand,   there were many who did indicate that there were worse parts of their NDE.&nbsp; The   number one most difficult part of the NDE were factors having to do with   integrating the experience with the earth reality (25.68%).&nbsp; These factors being   considered crazy, not being able to share experience, feelings of rejection   because &quot;people don't believe me,&quot; feeling disconnected, alone, confused,   depressed, homesickness (as the other side was considered home), and lack of   purpose.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, there was a high percentage of NDErs (23.97%) who   indicated that they were angry, upset, felt rejected, or depressed at having to   come back to earth because they really wanted to stay on the other side. There   were 19.18% of NDErs that said they had physical or emotional problems during or   after the experience.&nbsp; The answers consisted of physical/emotional pain, dealing   with physical recovery, the initial realization of dying or being dead, and the   loss of existing family ties.&nbsp; Many NDErs talked about the worse part of the   experience as being factors related to the experiences (9.93%).&nbsp; These factors   were leaving a being(s), the void, the tunnel, being in hell, discovering Satan   exists, floating, or the life review.&nbsp; Fear of death or the unknown accounted   for 4.45% of the answers.&nbsp; There were 1.71% of NDErs who indicated that there   were no good parts about their NDE.&nbsp;

Out of 296 NDErs, 190   (64%) checked the box that indicated that they experienced a change in their   personal relationships. NDErs were asked to describe, &quot;How has the experience   affected your relationships? Daily life? Religious practices etc.? Career   choices?&quot;&nbsp; Even though this question addresses more than specifically talking   about relationships, you can see that there is a hierarchy of relationships and   emotions that happens.&nbsp; NDErs talk about their spiritual journey or connection   to the supreme being, they talk of their connection with others by helping or   changing careers to help others.&nbsp; They talk of their personal connections with   friends and family.&nbsp; On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are those who   still talk about these connections but rather in the context of being estranged,   disconnected, fragmented, confused and depressed.

DISCUSSION

&quot;Yes, I   understood from the experience at that young age that you take with you when you   die the feelings which you have now and I also felt at the time that we, alone,   are the judge of ourselves, that life is what you make of it and I understood   the importance of ones emotional state whilst you're alive.&quot; - Sharon

In a recent Dutch NDE   study headed by van Lommel, he noted that during the 8 year prospective study   that the life-change inventory had statistically significant values in the areas   of social attitude, religious attitude, attitude towards death and a category of   'others' (van Lommel, p. 2042).&nbsp; The social attitude listed the factors of   showing own feelings, acceptance of others, more loving, empathic, understanding   others, and involvement in family.&nbsp; Religious attitudes that were significant   included understanding the purpose of life, sense inner meaning of life, and an   interest in spirituality.&nbsp; The attitude to death showed a marked decline in the   fear of death and a belief in life after death.&nbsp; The other category consisted of   an interest in the meaning of life, understanding oneself, and an appreciation   of ordinary things.&nbsp; This study corroborates the findings of the Dutch study and   expands on these concepts.

When NDErs were   questioned about religion and spirituality, an overwhelming majority of NDErs   used the words &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;love&quot; interchangeably (Long, Jody 2002a). &nbsp;The   more love they felt, the more spiritual the experience.&nbsp; From this particular   study, it appears that the top positive emotions are peace, joy, happiness, and   love.&nbsp; No emotions mentioned after returning even came close to the intensity of   peace, joy, happiness, and love that NDErs mentioned during their experience.&nbsp;   Interestingly, the emotions concerning comfort, contentment, freedom, safety,   and sense of oneness, did not show up as the top positive emotions after the   return to their body.&nbsp; Also interesting is that upon return to the body, some   top emotions that did not show up during the NDE were &quot;a sense of purpose,&quot;   &quot;glad for a second chance,&quot; gratitude, and understanding.&nbsp; The number one   mentioned emotion during the experience is the peace and calm that 40% of   experiencers felt.&nbsp; However, this emotion drops to number two at 12.89% after an   NDEr returns to the body.&nbsp; The number one emotion expressed upon returning from   a NDE is confusion and uncertainty as expressed by 12.89% of NDErs.&nbsp;

One of the main   categories of healing that NDErs mentioned was emotional healing (Long, Jody   2002b).&nbsp; Participants in a recent healing survey were asked, 'Have you ever   experienced any emotional healing that you attribute to your experience?'&nbsp; &nbsp;A   total of 112 NDErs (90.3%) and 70 (93.3%)&nbsp; non-NDErs responded.&nbsp; Of the   responders, 80 (71.4%) NDErs and 50 (66.7%) non-NDErs gave explanations or   examples.&nbsp;Many participants define healing in the context of emotional healing.&nbsp;   The most frequently mentioned category for emotional healing contains the   concept of continuity of life and the loss of fear of death.&nbsp; A high percentage   of both NDErs and non-NDErs also define emotional healing as peace and more   relaxed about life.&nbsp; Another large category is that participants use descriptive   words such as empathy, feelings, emotions, intuition, expanded awareness, and   love.&nbsp; The expanded awareness of being able to feel other peoples' feelings   helps the person to be able to say the right thing for healing to occur.&nbsp;It   appears that the same emotions occur during and after the NDE and also play a   key role in emotional healing.

Some other concepts   that kept recurring in the comments were emotions and patterns.&nbsp; The emotions   that occurred at the initial stage of the NDE were either a feeling of being   lost, shocked, fear or being disturbed at dying, but then they go to the light   and are not afraid.&nbsp; Contrarily, they express great peace, joy, and happiness at   this phase of the NDE.&nbsp; Then many NDErs get angry, depressed, or feel rejected   when they have to come back.&nbsp; These feelings, when coming back, cross over with   the individual and play an integral part in integration of the experience.&nbsp; 
  
  One observation is that one sees the typical &quot;grief&quot; emotions, both coming and   going.&nbsp; When a person dies, they may experience loss or grief upon leaving the   body and their earthly relationships.&nbsp; Then upon return to the body, the loss or   grief centers around leaving other beings or being separated from the great   peace, love, and happiness of the other side.&nbsp; The normal person appears to go   through the stages of denial, anger, depression, acceptance, and love in various   degrees.

A big catalyst for   negative emotions after coming back to life was the discrepancy between the   experience and what the person came back to.&nbsp; The confusion of not knowing what   happened, not being able to explain it, or even if they could explain it - not   being believed, were all important reasons for being confused, depressed, or   upset.&nbsp; Fear appears to play a base part in how people interpret an experience   or how it affects the integration process on earth.

Just as emotions are   key to accessing information in the brain, emotions define who we are and our   roles on earth.&nbsp; For many people, the love they felt on the other side was able   to permeate into every part of their earth life.&nbsp; Their relations on earth   intensified, they connected better with their children and significant other,   and related better spiritually to a supreme being or the universe.&nbsp; For others,   coming back meant some painful changes before they could be happy.&nbsp; One of the   highest categories for family relationships was &quot;Divorce&quot; at 5.46%.&nbsp; The   integration time on earth can be difficult and stressful, not only on the person   but on the entire family.&nbsp;

An interesting   finding was what words of emotion NDErs used to describe their experience.&nbsp; A   little over ' of the NDErs used the same word to describe feelings during and   after the experience. &nbsp;However, 43.2% of the NDErs used opposite words to   describe feelings during and after the experience.&nbsp; People have a tendency to   find emotional balance and make sense out of their world (Long, Jody 2000).&nbsp;   Perhaps the discrepancy in emotions during and after the NDE account for the   motivation to change.&nbsp; Moreover, using the same words as peace, love, and joy,   may move one's mindset into the spiritual realm as discussed above.&nbsp;   Consequently, where one is exposed to extreme love and subjected to a wide   discrepancy with earth reality, these factors could be one of the primary   reasons for such a high rate of spiritual transformation.

Emotions are a   constant on both sides of the veil.&nbsp; Moreover, it turns out that memories may   not be stored in the physical brain (Long, Jody 2000).&nbsp; Therefore, it is not   that large of a leap to rationalize that emotions may not be physically stored   in the brain either since we take both, our memories and emotions, with us.&nbsp;   Perhaps one of the purposes on earth is to learn how to transform ourselves by   using the emotional constant of love.&nbsp; The pons part of the brain may function   as an emotional receiver when interfacing with the strong subconscious emotions   produced from the NDE, and the cortex may be more of an emotional modulator that   helps us find balance in our emotions by consciously being able to reason or   modify how we feel.&nbsp; Part of this integration may be rationally using love to   overcome the instinctual fear and anger physically housed in the pons.
