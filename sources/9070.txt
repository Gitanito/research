After surgery, I was in such pain that I thought I was dying. I knew I was losing consciousness and told my roommate to call my wife and say goodbye for me. I passed out and my roommate hit the nurse's emergency button and got me some help. Here is what I experienced. I drifted to above and to the foot of my bed and looked down and saw a nurse enter our room and felt for my pulse and, not getting one, she tried slapping my wrist and retrying. Not getting a pulse, she rang for a code red or blue (whatever) and I watched as another nurse, a nun, a doctor and intern rushed into my room and started working on me. I watched as they brought in a gurney and transferred me to it. They brought in two machines and connected me up. 

I floated up above, watched, and listened to the whole procedures until they revived me. I had gone into shock. Anyway, later I repeated my experience to my roommate verbatim and he was amazed as to my accuracy. There was no fear during my experience. It was the most calming time of my life. I do not know how close to death I was, if at all. You are the second person I have told this to. Benny my roommate being the other.
