47 A PREFACE TO SPIRITUALISM
Some Things With Which Beginners Should Be
Familiar Before Attempting a More Extended
BF Study of the Subject
By Mark A. Barwise, LL.M.
'
t IS my purpose to set forth in this and the
following issues of this magazine, during 1936,
in the simplest language possible, a few truths
which our young people of high school age
and development, and beginners of any age,
ought to master thoroughly before undertaking
a more profound study of the great body of
knowledge known as the Science, Philosophy
and Religion of Spiritualism.
I.-The Spirit Body
First of all each of us must realize that he
has a spirit body right now. This spirit body
is an exact duplicate of the physical body, only
it is made up of a substance very much finer
than the matter of which the physical body is
made. The atoms of this spirit body permeate
and keep alive the atoms of the physical body.
Every particle of the physical body, every
wrinkle, every crease, every hair, is animated
by a corresponding particle, wrinkle, crease
and hair of the spirit ~body,»" The spirit body
is the real body, the one which lasts when the
physical body is worn out, the one which sur-
vives physical death. lt is the spirit body that
clairvoyant mediums see in seances. It looks
just like the physical body. It carries the
family traits and features. It determines the
growth and development of the physical body.
It is the framework on which the coarser ma-
terial of the physical body is draped. It has
a spirit brain, spirit eyes and ears and all the
senses, just as the physical body has, but these
spirit senses are attuned to the things of the
Spirit Vorld. 'lt is the unusual development
of these senses of the spirit body, and of cer-
tain areas of the spirit brain, that constitutes
what is called mental mediumship.
II.-The Spirit World
When the physical body dies the spirit body
emerges out of it and continues to exist in the§

Spirit World, a world made up of substances
in very much higher pitches of vibration than
thosewhich constitute matter, and which is
located immediately about the surface of the
earth( The new~born spirit is welcomed by
his spirit friends who have foreseen the time
of his leaving the physical body and have held
themselves in readiness for the event. He is
furnished with clothing and taken to a home
prepared by them for him/ The Spirit World
into which he has entered is a natural world
with trees and grass and flowers, with houses
and gardens. All his nearest relatives and
friends come to greet him and he is made to
feel at home. He soon realizes that he has
passed through the great change called death,
which is dreaded so much by most people, and
rejoices in his pleasant surroundings and his
renewed contacts with all those he used to
associate with in earth life. A feeling of joy-
ous relief pervades his being, as he realizes
more fully that he has survived in a beautiful
world with all his faculties, all his tastes, all
his knowledge, all his memories, all his affec-
tions, unimpaired and in full vigor. He is
told by his father and mother and old friends
of the wonderfullife on which he has entered,
of the never-ending unfoldment of all his pow-
ers of mind and qualities of character, as he
advances from grade to grade in this new life.
/He soon realizes how wonderful it is to be
permanently relieved of all material struggles,
of all anxiety over making a living, over the
worries of business and finance, over the care
of property, and over all the things that have
engrossed so much of his time and energy
while he was on
earth/
III.-The Different Zones
He will learn after a while of the different
zones that make up the Spirit World. We
know of four zones directly, and three more
indirectly. That is, we have talked with a very
advanced spirit who controls one of our most
highly unfolded mediums, and whose home is
in the Fourth Zone. He in turn has been in
contact with spirits who live in the Fifth and

Sixth Zones. They tell him that there is a
Seventh Zone about this earth, and that it
generally takes several thousand years for an
ordinary spirit to evolve to a condition of
spiritual refinement suitable to live in the
Seventh Zone, although superior spirits, the
great intellectual and spiritual leaders of the
earth, may attain to that condition in several
hundred years/
The Fjrst Zone of the Spirit World is im-
mediately about the face of the earth. In fact
it may be said to be the reverse side of the
tapestry of our earth world. It exists in a
rate of vibration much higher than that which
makes up our material world. The chief dis-
tinction between the substance of the Spirit
World and the material of the physical world
is that the former is so fine in nature that it
is imperceptible by the physical senses. In
reality all is one Universe, only on different
planes of being. All is governed by great uni-
versal natural laws, only those laws operate
somewhat differently on different
planes
of be-
ing-that is, in the different zones. The First
Zone is about sixty miles deep/ It 'is made
up of the coarsest substance of the Spirit
World. It differs from the Second Zone to
about the same degree that the earth world
differs from it.
qbout sixty miles out from the surface of
the earth begin the strata of substance that
make up the floor, so to speak, that is the con-
tinental foundation of the Second Zone/ This
roof of the First Zone, and floor of the Second
Zone, is unknowable to the senses of spirit peo-
ple in the First Zone. The sun and moon and
stars shine right through it, just as they shine
through our atmosphere/The Second Zone is
considerably deeper than the First,/but above
it several hundred miles begin the strata that
make up the continental foundation of the
Third Zone. /Above the Third Zone at a still
greater interval comes the foundation of the
Fourth Zone, and so on at greater intervals are
the foundations of the Fifth, Sixth and Sev-
enth Zones. All seven zones taken together

are less in depth than the diameter of the
earth/
The prevailing opinion in the three upper
zones, as reported to the zones below, is that
beyond the Seventh Zone there is a Universal
Spirit World that is in touch with the upper
zones of the various inhabitable planets in the
Universe at large, but this opinion is vague and
indefinite, and nothing much about it is actu-
ally known to the spirit people living in those
zones that are in touch with the mediums of
earth.
'We have definite reports that on the Second,
Third and Fourth Zones there are hills and
mountains, rivers, lakes and plains/ On all
four of the lower zones, at least, there are grass
and trees and flowers, with birds singing in
the trees, with beautiful sunsets and sunrises,
just as on earth. But all colors there are
much more vivid and gorgeous, and all tones
much clearer and more delicate, than the cor-
responding colors and tones of our world.
IV.-The Spirit Senses
The eyes and ears, the senses of touch and
smell and taste, of the individual spirit are at-
tuned to the pitches of vibration and the densi-
ties of the substances that make up the en-
vironment of the Zone in which he lives. To
the newly arrived spirit in the First Zone his
surroundings are as definite and tangible and
solid to his spirit senses, as were the things
of earth to his physical senses. The trees and
flowers and houses, the bodies of his spirit
friends, and his own body, are as solid and
tangible as the corresponding things of earth
are to us. There is nothing weird or spooky
or uncanny about life there, but all is as natural
and pleasant and comfortable as could be de-
sired.
The Spirit World abounds in fruit. 'New-
comers are under the obsessing habit of eating,
and they are provided with this fruit as long as
this habit lasts, but after a little they learn that
eating is unnecessary that the atmosphere they
breathe supplies all the sustenance they needf.
Raymond reported to his father, Sir Oliver
Lodge, that he enjoyed smoking in his spirit

home, and my father has been reported to me
as enjoying his pipe as he putters around his
garden. Presumably this habit of smoking
wears away after a few years/
Spirits who pass out of the body in a normal
condition, and with an ordinary degree of de-
velopment, can see all the spirits of the First
Zone with whom they come in contact, just as
they see the trees and houses. But they can not
see spirits from the Second Zone, or Zones
above, who happen to have descended to the
First Zone, unless those spirits voluntarily re-
duce their pitch of vibration and take on a
coarser condition of -bodily substance, unless
they "materialize," so to speak, to a condition
in harmony with the things of the First Zone.
They can not rise to the Second Zone, or sense
things from that Zone, until they have
progressed to a finer spiritualized condition
that is in tune with conditions of the Secon
Zone. The Zones are as distinct from each
other as the earth is from the First Zone. The
great majority of spirits arriving in the Spirit
World never have heard of the higher Zones,
and generally linger in the First Zone for a cen-
tury or more before they become aware that
there is anything beyond; although very ad-
vanced spirits may only linger here a year or
two, or even a few months. Each spirit has a
specific state of consciousness and vibration
that confines him to the Zone to which he is
attuned.
V.-Mental Mediumship
Mental mediumship, as was noted above, is a
sensitiveness of the spirit body, a sensitiveness
of the sense organs of the spirit body. The me-
dium sometimes sees with his spirit eyes peo-
ple and scenes in the Spirit World, and we call
this faculty clairvoyance; or he hears with his
spirit ears words spoken in the Spirit World, or
music from that world, and we call this faculty
clairaudience; or he may just sense clearly the
nearness or dispositional traits of spirits who
approach his aura, and we call this faculty clair-
sentience; or pictures and sounds may be
thrown by spirit operators directly on the ap-

propriate centers of the spirit brain of the me-
dium, without passing through the usual ave-
nues of the senses. But in all these cases, and
in many others besides, it is a question of the
spirit brain of the medium becoming attuned
to vibrations from the Spirit World. Spirits
may approach us every day, but we are un-
aware of it unless our own spirit brains, or the
spirit brain of some medium friend present,
be tuned up to a point in harmony with the
visiting spirit.
"
When a spirit is able to come into complete
harmony with the pitch of vibration of the
spirit brain of the medium, he may throw the
flood of his own thought and feeling over the
brain of the medium, may completely dominate
the brain of the medium and use it as his own
for the time being, sending his thoughts and
feelings through it, controlling the organs of
speech, and all the organs of the medium. When
so controlling he may speak and dance and
sing, may play the piano, may give full expres-
sion to his thought and feeling, and if a foreign-
er may speak or write in a language unknown
to the medium,/ The phenomenon of spirit
control is one of the most beautiful and con-
vincing phases of mediumship, and brings
home to us with a new sense of reality the
great truth of the nearness and naturalness
of the life in the Spirit World.
VI.-Physical Mediumship
'"/The phenomena of spirit raps, the movement
of ponderable bodies, the tipping of tables, slate
writing, and the various degrees and kinds of
materialization, are produced by the agency of
spirit people through what is called physical
mediumship/ Those phenomena which take
place apart from the body of the medium, not
dependent on his muscular agency, and whose
mind is not concerned in their production are
said to be produced by physical mediumship.
The first raps at Hydesville were the first phe-
nomena to successfully attract the attention of
the world to the great truths of the nearness
and naturalness of the Spirit World, and to the
fact that it was possible for the two worlds to

readily communicate. The fact that answers
to questions are given by rapping out responses
in accordance with an agreed code, or in sig-
naling at the proper letter when the alphabet is
called aloud, is conclusive evidence of the
existence of an unseen intelligent operator who
is not connected with the mind of the medium.
So the appearance of materialized hands and
faces and full forms, several feet from the
medium's chair to which he is securely tied,
absolutely precludes the possibility of the
medium's taking any directing part in their
production. Thousands of people were con-
vinced of communication by physical phe-
nomena who probably never would have been
convinced by any sort of mental phenomena.
It is not too much to say that, if the phe-
nomena at Hydesville had been that of en-
trancement instead of raps, our movement
never would have gotten a start, or at least
would have been postponed for many years.
The first spirit raps at Hydesville, and for
some time afterward, were not raps at all, that
is were not produced by striking one object
against another. They were percussive-like-
sounds, but were actually produced by tiny
electrical and magnetic explosions. Physical
mediums give oil from their 'bodies magnetic
and electrical substances, which when charged
with, or combined with, substances brought by
the controls from the Spirit World, make up a
substance that the spirits can explode so as to
produce sound waves in our
atmosphere. All
spirit raps for some years were little explosions,
varying in volume from a tiny tick, like that of
a watch, to that which sounded as loud as a
hammer blow. It is said that this method of
rapping was an invention of Benjamin Frank-
lin on the Spirit Side, and that the Hydesville
Rappings were the outcome of the decision of
a spirit congress to put Franklin's discovery to
a practical test.
The force used in moving ponderable bodies,
and in producing slate writing, is similar to
that used in producing raps, and is built up in
a similar way.

The substance used in materializing a hand,
a face, or full form, is made up from a combi-
nation of atoms taken from the medium and
sitters with atoms brought from the spirit
World.,~
We hear a good deal nowadays about
ectoplasm, but it is only a new name for the
same old substance that was used in the se-
ances conducted by Crookes and Wallace and
Zollner and Koons.
Years later, after guides and controls learn-
ed to materialize non-living substances in phy-
sical seances, raps were often made by striking-
a solid materialized substance against physical
matter, such as a table or mirror or picture
frame. Nowadays both methods are used, but
the older method is still the more common.
VII.-Guide and Controls
T
There may be a few people in the world who
are so psychically dense as to be incapable of
being influenced by spirits, but only a few.
Almost every one is able to be so influenced,
unconsciously and in some slight degree. Every
one who can be so influenced has a spirit
attendant or guide, whose chief duty it is to
keep in constant touch with his special protege
and to attempt to influence him whenever op-
portunity offers toward right-doing and away
from wrong-doing. These guides perform a
universal missionary work which must be a
heart-breaking and discouraging undertaking,
considering what a Weak and wilful and wick-
ed lot most of us earth people are.
The guide studies the spirit bodies of a num-
ber of boys and girls, often in early childhood,
studies their soul-qualities, their personalities,
their aural emanations, their innate capabili-
ties, and selects as his personal charge the
one with whose natural pitch of vibration,
whose soul-tone, he is more nearly in tune, al-
ways seeing to it that his own soul-tone is
slightly above, and so have an elevating in-
fluence upon that of his charge.
It is interesting to note that most of the
guides in this country are American Indians,
while in England most of them are Hindoos,
and in France Indo-Chinese. All three of these

races have a calmness of temperament, a poise
and patience, that render them especially
adapted for this sort of work. It is also an
interesting fact that spirits remain in that part
of the Spirit World above and near their native
land, unless on some special work or by force
of association they are attracted abroad, as
were the Hindoos and Indo-Chinese by the
governing classes of their respective countries
who returned to Europe from the East. We
Spiritualists owe a tremendous debt of grati-
tude to the Indian guides for their patience
and unsellish devotion to our mediums. With-
out them it is extremely doubtful if our move-
ment would have attained its present success.
They are constantly at work accelerating and
enhancing the slow and natural unfoldment
of the mediumistic faculties.
These guides may change from time to time,
but generally each remains constantly atten-
tive through the earth life of his charge, and
for some little time after the charge enters the
Spirit World. He selects the members of the
band of helpers, who are changed as the work
and interests of the charge change, selecting
those who are best 'fitted to help. He sees to
it that no spirit whose influence would be inim-
ical is allowed to contact with his charge. An
actor may have an Indian guide, but this guide
selects for the band former actors who may be
able to more effectively aid his charge in his
work on the stage. If the charge becomes
suliiciently mediumistic so that he is aware of
spirit help, or is able to be entranced, we speak,
of the entrancing spirit as a 'control'. Most
people have guides, but only mediums have
controls.
The spirit senses and the physical senses are
the doors and windows of the soul, through
which it looks out on the Universe, and through
which messages from the Universe outside are
brought. It has a double set of doors and
windows. Through the physical senses it is
intouch with the physical world, and through-
the spirit senses it is in touch with the Spirit
World.

VIII.-The Soul
The soul is the real self, the thinking and
feeling entity, the distinct individuality, the
personality, that goes on learning and becom-
ing more and more unfolded and refined, all
through earth life and all through life in the
advancing Zones beyond. The individual
human soul is the grandest product of the
Universe, beside which all else, whether motes
in the sunbeams or the mightiest stars and
nebulae, is as dross and chaff. The individual
soul is the crown and glory of cosmic life. It
is the seat of all thinking, all memory, all im-
pulses, all aspirations, all loves and hates, is
immortal in its nature when it attains human
grade, and as such is capable of unlimited de-
velopment. The mind is the thinking part of
the soul. While on earth the soul functions
through two bodies, the physical body and the
spirit body which animates the physical, and
after it lays aside the physical body at death,
it functions through the spirit body alone.
The best informed controls teach that the
soul has its origin at the moment of the con-
ception of the physical body, as does the spirit
body, being a combination of the soul-stuff of
the father and the soul-stuff of the mother, and
continues to unfold and develop as the physical
and spirit bodies unfold and develop. It has a
microscopic beginning, but it has almost god-
like possibilities.
Its individuality, its inner nature, is deter-
mined at the moment of conception, and the
pitch of its vibration, its soul-tone, is estab-
lished at that time. Its soul-tone is the re-
sultant of the soul-tones of the father and
mother at the time of conception. Its entire
development, before birth, during earth life,
and during its life in the Zones beyond, is de-
termined by the pitch of vibration of its soul-
tone. It will attract to itself from out the
Universe, physical and spiritual, those things
that are in harmony with it. It will drift on a

certain key of life. Efforts of spirit guides
may be able to slightly raise that pitch of
vibration, and if the nature of the individual is
aroused to aspiration then its soul-tone will be
more rapidly raised. Aspiration is the chief
motive power of spiritual growth, and after
reaching the Spirit World and becoming freed
from the entanglements of matter, aspiration
on the part of the spirit is more easily aroused
and his spiritual development becomes greatly
accelerated. But the great determining factor
of the nature of one's individual life is the
soul-tone established at the moment of his con-
ception.
Souls are unique in the Universe. If each
of us was not a conscious, thinking being, and
did not directly experience ideas, no one
could ever make us understand what con-
sciousness is on the part of other beings. There
is nothing like it in this world or the next.
It is a thing apart and separated by an un-
bridgable gulf from everything else. The soul
feels its independence from all else in the
Universe. It understands things without, but
it knows that it is not a part of them. It un-
derstands other souls, other conscious beings,
but it knows that it is not identified with them,
nor they with it.
IX.-Life in the First Zone
When we arrive in the First Zone our spirit
bodies are in harmony with the substances of
that Zone.- We each have a specific gravity
that confines us to that Zone, and this density
or gravity is reflective of the stage we have
attained in the mental and spiritual unfold-
ment of our souls./As our souls become more
refined and unfolded the density of our spirit
bodies grows less and less, and their substance
takes on a finer and finer nature, and after
many years of growth when our mental and
spiritual natures are ready for the Second Zone
our bodily natures will be ready too-thafis,

be in tune with the substance of the Second
Zone.
'
When a person goes to the First Zone in a
weakened and exhausted condition, from long
sickness or from great age, his spirit body will
show this weakness which has been reflected
upon it from the physical body, and he will be
placed in a sanitorium for a while and treated
by spirit healers and physicians. After a few
days generally, sometimes a few weeks, but
rarely as long as a few months, he will 'rind
himself restored to normal health and vitality;
for health and buoyancy of feeling is the nor-
mal condition of spirit life/
"'After a few months the aged, decrepit and
infirm find themselves growing younger, find
the wrinkles disappearing from their faces,
their steps growing more elastic, and their
minds growing more alert. Not that white
hair turns dark, but they gradually return to
the condition of their greatest mental and
spiritual development, to that of a hale and
hearty sixty/ a
'Children grow up in the Spirit World, and
they grow up to look just as they would have
looked if they had matured here. They grow
up to have the family features and mental
traits that they have inherited from their
parents and more remote ancestors;/'
Many go to the Spirit World feeling worn
out in mind and body, from long years of
working beyond their strength, from almost
constant clashing of dispositions in inhar-
monious families and between antagonistic
working associates. The greatest desire of all
these millions of people is for rest. They have
no inner urge for exertion.
They don't have
to worry about making a living. So for several
years they just putter about their gardens,
visit with their friends, and enjoy a wonderful
feeling of release from drudgery/
But sooner or later, generally after a few

years at the longest, their interest in some sub-
ject becomes aroused, they have a desire to
know more about it, or to experience the sen-
sations of influencing a medium; they have a
yearning for a larger, fuller life. Then they
begin to exert themselves, and start on their
long up-ward climb of never-ending unfoldment
of mind and character. They learn at once the
great lesson of life in all Zones of being, that
all we have or attain we must earn by our own
striving, and that we can retain nothing that
we have not grown up to. They learn that
there is a dignity and grandeur in unforced
labor along the lines of our natural interests.
#Each does the kind of work that his experience
best Hts him for, and does it cheerfully and
gladly. qf his ability is mechanical he helps to
manufacture materials for houses or clothing
or furniture. If his ability is intellectual he
starts cultivating the intellect, starts rounding
out and improving his knowledge in the lield
of his individual interest/
X.-Spiritual Growth
When a spirit becomes aroused out of his
lethargic condition he soon learns that his un-
foldment is to be along two general lines-
mental and spiritual. Not only must his mind
be cultivated, but his character also must be
relined and cultivated. He grows by exercising
his talents, and by cultivating a desire for the
higher and finer. His efforts are two-fold:
irst, by reaching out and up to those above
him and learning from them, and, second, by
reaching out and down to those below him and
assisting and teaching them.
Besides this general process there is the spe-
cial task of undoing the wrongs of his earth
life. If there are those he has especially
wronged while on earth, he must labor to undo
the effects of those wrongs, as far as possible,
and to compensate the persons wronged by la-
boring to make their conditions brighter and

happier. It may be that these efforts must
continue for years, and even after the persons
wronged have come over to the Spirit Side/
Every unselfish endeavor to help another adds
to our own soul growth, whether on earth or in
the Zones beyond.
/Not only must we struggle to acquire desir-
able qualities, but we must struggle to get rid
of our undesirable traits of mind and disposi-
tion. We must labor to overcome all our sel-
fish impulses, all our unworthy desires, and
all of our unreasonable antipathies. We must
cultivate a feeling of kindly interest toward all
persons, whether in the mortal or in the spirit.
We must extend genuine feelings of forgive-
ness toward all who have wronged us. We
must build up an attitude of mind for kindly
generosity to a point where we will really want
to help all with whom we come in contact that
are in a condition of mind and character be-
low us.
All our efforts in helping others in the Spirit
World not only are of assistance to them, but
contribute toward our own soul growth. With
continued effort we become stronger, wiser and
more refined in our natures./ Our constant as-
piration toward a higher de'velopment, and our
constant yearning to help those 'below us up
to our level will widen our receptive faculties
and will move our center of attraction a little
farther along into the finer ranges of vibration,
and we shall soon find ourselves able to re-
ceive higher vibration and finer currents of
power and loftier thoughts than we were able
to receive only a few months before. This re-
fining process is slow, but it is continuous, and
in time we shall grow into a liner type of spirit
men and women and shall be vibrating on a
key much above that on which we arrived.
There is a great principle of evolution that
governs all things in the Spirit World, and all
of our efforts for good are in line with this
great principle and are assisted by it. When

we struggle unselfishly we are floating with the
tide of things; we are carried along by its
great momentum; but we don't get into this
great stream except by our own individual
strrvmgs.
XL-Vocations
In earth life most of our efforts necessarily
are for the purpose of making a living. Ve
work for ourselves and for those dependent on
us. In the Spirit World the conditions have
entirely changed and our purposes have en-
tirely changed. Over There, spirits do not
work with a ,selfish purpose. They do not
work for themselves nor for a corporation with
a view of gain, but they work for the good of
all their associates. Everyone gives his time
and effort in a noble unselfish service for the
co fort and betterment of his fellow beings.
e houses and clothing and furniture of
the First Zone, and for the most part in the
Second Zone, have to be made mechanically in
those Zones,/This gives occupation to all who
have any ability in those lines, and who care to
join in that sort of work. But nobody works
in the Spirit World from a feeling of compul-
sion, but only from inclination. Nobody tries
to turn out as much work as possible, but to
turn out the 'best of which they are capable.
Work becomes an art, and the things produced
are really artistic productions.
'
But on the Third and Fourth Zones a new
method begins to appear, and governs more
a d more as We ascend to Zones farther on.
fenibegin to create simple articles by the
power of thought alone/They do not create
the substance from which articles are made,
but are able to assemble the atoms and form
the image or shape of the thing to be made,
and then to solidify this image until it is in har-
mony with the pitch of vibration of the other
solid things of the Zone in which the experi-
ment is made. A very advanced spirit once
described to a friend of mine his ludicrous
efforts in first attempting to create a garment
for himself by the power of his own thought,

unassisted by his teachers. The garment was
in the nature of a fiowing robe and was of
many brilliant colors; but the difficulty was
that the colors would not stay put, and the dif-
ferent parts of the garment would not hold
together. He didn't have power enough to
stabilize the results of his efforts. He jokingly
spoke of the fearful and wonderful nature
of his garment, that it rivaled _]oseph's famous
coat of many colors, but that in a few min-
utes it wasn't a garment at all, but just a
heap of brilliant rags whose colors were fast
fading. Later on he became an expert at such
creations, but that was after a lot more study
and practice.
One point to bear in mind is that there is no
unpleasant or repulsive aspects to labor in the
Spirit World. All are busy when they feel like
it on self-imposed tasks that are congenial. It
may be said that each works at a hobby of his
own choosing, and may change his occupation
as often as he feels the inclination.
XII.-Evil and Its Consequences
"There are no demons or devils, no spiritual
beings who were created or evolved to inspire
wrong, in the Spirit World/ All the evil beings
in the Spirit World are men who were born on
earth and have gone into the First Zone
weighte down by their evil deeds while on
earth. The worst types, those who have given
a good share of their lives to robbery and plun-
der, to murder and rape and lustful acts, and
to all sorts of crime, arrive in the Spirit World
in a
partial, stupor and in a condition of total
darkness.'That is, their spirit senses are almost
atrophied. They can't see, they can't hear,
and can scarcely feel/ Their spirit friends may
gather about them, but they are unaware of it.
They don't know where they are. They don't
know that they have left the physical bodf
They generally think that they are in a dream,
and wonder when they will wake up. One of
the most highly unfolded spirits with whom I
ever came in contact went through this terrible
experience. He was a Mediaeval brigand, and
robbing and slaying was his occupation. He

was in the Spirit World nearly a century be-
fore he saw a single ray of light or a spirit
form. All this time his mother and her friends
had been in touch with him, had visited him
daily, had been sending him their tenderest
thoughts, and had been bathing him in waves
of spirit magnetism. The first 'break in the
total darkness was a single ray of light which
he followed. This ray kept growing broader
and broader, as he had an impulse to pray to
be lifted out of the darkness, and soon he saw
his mother's face, felt her arms about him
and realized that he was in the next world.
The origin and existence of evil can only be
understood in the light of evolution. All evil
instincts and traits and impulses were evolved
during our animal and savage ancestry, and
have been handed down to us from a dim and
distant past. Civilization for thousands of
years has -been given over to the slow and
blundering process of outgrowing and getting
rid of our animal and savage inheritance. For
the most refined and cultured of earth people
this process is pretty well completed here.
While the above instance is an extreme case,
there are thousands upon thousands of cases
almost, if not quite, as bad. The great ma-
jority of us will go to the Spirit World with
some slight taint of evil deeds in our char-
acters, which for the most part will be quickly
outgrown; but between the best of us and the
worst there are all gradations of spiritual con-
ditions, reaching from bright elfulgence, in
which the noble and good find themselves,
down through less bright, semi-twilight, twi-
light, to semi-darkness. All these conditions
are not objective, but are the results of our
dulled spirit senses and of our own making.
They are the natural result of the sum total of
all our thoughts and Words and deeds while
on
earth.
,Envy, jealousy, feelings of hatred and re-
venge, harboring enmity toward another, and
like impulses and their results, are much more
difficult to outgrow than impulses to get drunk,
to steal and impulses to indulge in sexual ir-
regularities and excesses, and their results.

All these evil
tra_§_s and conditions will be
outgrown in time. Evil and its results are
temporary in their nature. Every soul is des-
tined to a
glorious future. It is a matter of
weeks or months or years or centuries, when
the great law of spiritual evolution, aided and
hastened by our own aspirations and strivings,
will clear away all the dross from our charac-
ters, and leave us clean and resplendent and
refined "beings, ready to graduate from the
First Zone to the Second, where we shall con-
tinue our higher unfoldment, with no intima-
tion of an end./
XIII.-Animals in the Spirit World
Clairvoyant mediums frequently describe
spirit dogs, cats and horses, as being brought
to some one in the circle by some member of
the family. 'I`hey are described and a peculiar
marking or habit is noted as to each that ren-
ders it certain that the animal is a special pet
that passed away several years before. So
the question arises, Do all animals survive?
And many have jumped to the conclusion that
they do. But the a-blest of the controls explain
the matter in this way. Everything that has
life has a spirit body, and when in the course
of evolution the spirit body becomes sufficient-
ly stable to withstand the shock of physical
death then it survives for a longer or a shorter
time. With insects and the lower animals it
only survives a few moments, and then disin-
tegrates and dissolves back into the great
ocean of spirit substance to be taken up again
into t-he growing spirit bodies of other growing
animals. I am not aware that any control has
ever described a spirit deer or moose or fox or
any wild animal. But it seems that pets, over
whom we shower our affections, are strength-
ened in their natures. Our love does some-
thing for them that builds up a resistance be-
yond that of wild animals. They become so
stabilized in their spirit bodies that they are
able to survive for many years. They are
taken in charge by our spirit relatives and are
kept in their spirit homes to add to our
pleasure awaiting our arrival.

A relative of mine manifests every week
at a family circle. Nearly every time he comes
he speaks of his spirit dog, which preceded him
by some fifteen years into the Spirit World, as
coming with him. 'The dog has taken a great
interest in, and fancy to, a baby grand-daugh-
ter of my relative now in the old home where
the circle is held. The dog is described as rush-
ing into the bedroom as soon as he arrives each
week, smelling of all the baby's playthings and
about the crib where she is
sleeping,{'This sort
of contact with the material baby seems to
have aroused all the old protective instincts that
he had in earth life. It would be interesting to
know, if there were any way in which We could
find out, whether the dog is making his contact
on the physical plane or on the spiritual plane,
Whether he sees the baby's physical body or
her spirit body, whether he smells odors from
her material body or her playthings and crib,
or Whether he senses her spirit aura on them.
The Indian control of one of my old friends,
who has controlled him for more than 'dfty
years, and who has been in the Spirit Vorld
for nearly a century, describes his favorite dog
who has been in spirit all these years and is
still with him. This dog had jumped into the
water and saved one of the old chief's children
from drowning, and always had a place of
honor and affection in his earthly home. The
love tie between them was especially strong,
hence the long survival. But the dog is now
getting weak and feeble and sleeps most of the
time, and takes little notice of things about
him. He is about ready to distintegrate and
disappear.
XIV.-Education in the Spirit World
While as a general proposition it may be
said that the growth of our knowledge and
spiritual refinement goes on hand in hand in
the Spirit World, it is the degree of spiritual
refinement and not our intellectual develop-
ment that determines our home in that world
and our advancement from zone to zone. Our
spiritual refinement determines the density of
our spirit bodies-their specific gravity-and
hence their pitch of vibration. There are many

people of large intellect, but with wicked and
vicious natures, who will linger in the first zone
for many, many years, before they will have
evolved to that condition necessary to enter
the second zone.
{~"All the zones are educational, as life in the
Spirit World is one continuous process of
education, no matter what the immediate task
or vocation may be, but the third zone is pri-
marily known as the school zone. Here are
located most of the ordinary schools, most of
the ordinary colleges, and most of the special
schools, as of music, painting, sculpture, etc.
Nearly all children who go into the Spirit
World under twelve years of age are taken
directly to this zone, and enter some school.
Some few children who have a vicious strain
in their natures, and who have inherited espe-
cially evil traits, are kept in zones below the
third and given special treatment, until they
have advanced out of their evil condition and
are able to be taken to the School Zone/
All the children in the third zone are taken
on frequent visits to the zones below to visit
their parents or near relatives. If the condi-
tions in their former homes on earth are not
such as to do them harm, they are often taken
to visit them also. All the children as they
reach their 'teens are taken for visits to the
zones below and to the earth, in order that they
may learn of denser spirit conditions and of
material things, for the purpose of widening
their experience and enlarging their knowledge
of life in the two worlds.
The children are taught all the ordinary
branches of learning that earthly children are
taught, and many other
thi$s
that earthly
teachers know nothing about. They are given
individual training to unfold any special latent
talents that they may possess/
Of course, children in their normal condi-
tion, attuned to the pitch of vibration of the
third zone, could not by themselves become at-
tuned to the things of the first or second zone,
or to the things of earth. They have to be
taught how, and helped, to lower their vibra-
tion when taking these excursions into lower

conditions, so as to come in touch with the
people and things they wish to study. This
change of vibration is always necessary when
traveling from zone to zone if one wishes to
get into full rapport with the new zone. just
as a medium has to become keyed up to see
spirits in the first zone, so spirits have to be-
come keyed down to get in touch with physical
persons or things. A spirit visiting earth con-
ditions sees the spirit bodies of earth people,
but does not see their physical bodies or their
houses and furniture unless he is keyed down
to harmonize with physical vibrations. Any
spirit who has lived for years on earth, and for
years in each of the first and second zones,
learns these things as he goes along, but spirit
children in the third zone have to learn them
as they return for study or for visiting. They
are always accompanied by older guides and
teachers on these trips.
_, XV.-Higher Learning
']ust as a dog cannot learn astronomy, be-
cause it is beyond his mental reach,/so there
are multitudes of things in the Spirit World
that we of earth cannot learn, as they are
wholly beyond our capacity to comprehend.
And while this capacity keeps enlarging as we
unfold on the lower zones, each zone has its
tremendous quota of truths that those on the
next zone below it cannot comprehend. Truths
come lioating into our minds as we rise in
condition and capacity to meet them and to
understand them.
All the subjects we have ever heard about,
and many that we have never even dreamed of,
are taught on all the zones, but on each suc-
ceeding zone, they are taught in a fuller and
larger way, with fuller and larger implications,
than on the next zone below. All the univer-
sal and cosmic connections of each subject are
set forth and made clear as we grow up to
grasp them. The circle of all knowledge keeps
enlarging, and keeps unifying into one grand
system of truth.
Ehere are imrxiense libraries filled with books
on all sorts of subjects on each zone, graded

to the intelligence of the people of that zone.
To each zone lecturers from a zone or two
above materialize, so to speak, and give courses
of lectures suited to enlarge the knowledge of
their classey/ The control spoken of above as
living on the fourth zone relates that he at-
tended classes conducted by a spirit from the
fifth zone, who was not only able to make clear
in words all the points he wished to convey,
but had a capacity for so impressing the minds
of his students that they actually felt the tru`th
of his teaching, that their minds were indelibly
stamped with these truths, in much the same
way that a clairvoyant vision, if from a suffi-
ciently high source, remains in the memory of
the medium a whole life-time on earth.
There is an endless amount of learning ahead
of us. Libraries of books devoted to the his-
tory of events, the history of ideas, the growth
of knowledge; libraries devoted to research;
libraries devoted to the study of the great
natural laws and how they work differently on
different planes of being and in different
octaves of vibration; libraries, too, devoted to
philosophical conclusions at different stages of
unfoldment-conclusions that are sound gen-
eralizations of all that is known, say, on the
second zone, and then on the next zone larger
conclusions as to all that is known after adding
the knowledge obtained on the third zone, and
so on.
With the growth of the intellectual grasp all
lesser truths merge into larger truths, not only
here on the face of the earth but through all
the zones beyond.
XVI.-Illumination
We frequently hear people say that there is
no night in the Spirit World, implying that all
is one constant glare of light. This is not
true. _/Spirit people enjoy the sunlight and the
shade of trees just as we do/ Our sun is their
sun, although it is the spiritual side of the
sun, a finer kind of light, that illuminates the
Spirit World. They are not affected by the
coarser and slower waves of light that affect
us. Each Zone is lighted by a finer set of

vibrations than that which lights the next Zone
below it. The heat from the sun in each Zone
i-s produced by that set of vibrations attuned
to the conditions of the substance that makes
up that Zone, just as the earth's heat from the
sun is produced by the action of the coarser
rays on the material that makes up the earth
world. A different octave _of vibrations
adapted to, and harmonizing with, each of the
grades of substance that make up the earth
world and each of the Zones above, but all
from the same sun, illuminates and warms the
carth and each of the Zones.
The body of the earth is not transparent to
these finer octaves of light-that is, the rays
do not shine right through it as they do
through glass-but the earth is partially trans-
lucent to them. They pass through it, as the
wireless waves do, and with about the same in-
tensity as electric light shines through a heavy
china globe. The result is that the nights in
the Spirit World are not as dark as ours, but
are somewhat lighter than our moonlight, a
very mellow and pleasant light. All the Zones
rotate with the earth, so that they have the
same sunset and sunrise effects as we have.
I have never heard any spirit refer to arti-
ficial light for their houses, but as we know
from the many spirit lights in seances that
spirits are familiar with the idea of making
artificial light, combining as they do substance
from the Spirit Side with matter from our
world in such a way as to produce a light
material enough to be seen by a roomful of
people with their physical eyes. So they prob-
ably do manufacture artificial light from the
finer grades of electricity, or from other forces
and substances unknown to us, for use in their
homes and public buildings.
XVII.-Time and Space
/We often hear it stated that time and space
are unknown in the Spirit World./This is a
mistake. What is meant is that spirits have
overcome the difficulties of time and space, as
we say the airplane has brought Chicago very
close to New York. The spirits have the same

sun that we have, high in summer and low in
winter, and equal days and nights on March
21st and September Zlst. They have the same
moon with all its phases. They have time just
as we have it and measured in the same way.
It takes a long period of years for a child to
grow from infancy to maturity in the Spirit
World, just as it does here.
It is unfortunate that Zollner should have
used the term "fourth dimension" in connec-
tion with his experiments in materialization
and dematerialization, as many Spiritualists
have been using it ever since as
though it did
away with the three dimensional nature of
objects in the Spirit World. What Slade's
controls were dealing with, and what all other
spirits are dealing with, is the different grades
of atoms and the different pitches of vibra-
tion, not with different dimensions. Because
a radio wave goes through a steel vault does
not mean that it exists in any other dimension,
any more than another dimension is concerned
with a quart of peas filtering down through a
cart-load of squash.
A spirit body of a control occupies the same
space that his earthly body did. One of the
controls of one of my friends is described as
being over six feet tall and broad shouldered.
He is a three dimensional being, in the Spirit
World, just as he was in the earth world. I
once asked an Indian control of one of my
friends what his sensation was as he came
through the walls of the cottage where we were
sitting, one dark rainy night, and he replied:
"Chief, you walk through the shadow of a
tree on a bright, sunny day. You know the
shadow is there, but it doesn't impede your
progress any. I knew these walls were here
when I walked through them tonight, but they
didn't impede my progress, any more than the
shadow impedes yours."
XVIII.-Travel
When spirits first arrive in the First Zone
their normal means of locomotion is to walk,
just as on earth. As they were leaving their
physical bodies, they were met by relatives and

friends and were taken to their new homes.
They frequently speak of gliding through the
air as they were being conducted to these
homes, but they can't do this for some time,
under their own power. They have to be
assisted in this sort of travel by some one who
knows how. At first and for some time they
walk about with their feet on the ground. After
a while they are taught how to make use of
their thought forces, or perhaps more accur-
ately, forces somewhat similar to thought forces
that are generated by spirit brains in spirit
bodies, as a motive power, for little journeys
for short distance As they become stronger,
and are more roficient in applying these
forces, they can travel anywhere in the First
Zone, at a tremendous rate of speed. They are
able to raise themselves a little way off the
ground and glide through space, slowly or
more rapidly as they wish,/ They can travel
from one country to another in a few seconds.
This is what they mean when they say that
time and space are done away with in the
Spirit World. It is in respect to travel that
they thus speak. If they are at a circle in
Maine and wi-sh to visit some one's home in
California, they are there almost immediately,
and after a few minutes return with the in-
formation they sought. They can only travel
in the First Zone if they normally live in that
zone, as the density of their spirit bodies pre-
vents their rising into a finer vibration. If a
spirit newcomer in the First Zone is especially
anxious to visit his child who lives in the
Third Zone, it is the child who is assisted to
slow down his vibration and visit his father in
the First Zone, rather than the father's being
assisted to ascend to the home of the child.
Travel in the Spirit World is perfectly nat-
ural. Every organism manufactures its own
power. .Every brain, both on its physical side
and on its spiritual side, is a dynamo for the
generation of electrical forces. In the physical
body we call these forces nerve forces. In the
spirit body we call them auras. In the Spirit
World we learn to make use of these forces as
a motive power. There are no artificial means

of traveling in the Spirit World, no railroads,
no automobiles, and no aeroplanes.
XIX.-Auras
The spirit bodies of all persons generate and
radiate a magnetic atmosphere which normally
extends out about a foot from the body, but
with those persons whom we designate as es-
pecially magnetic this atmosphere may extend
out four or five feet. This atmosphere is called
an aura. Auras differ in quality and color ac-
cording to the mental and spiritual conditions
of the person-s from whom they radiate. They
are frequently visible to the clairvoyant me-
dium. There is this grain of truth in the tradi-
tion of the halos ofthe saints. These auras are
all sorts of colors, but in general it may be
said the brighter and more effulgent the aura
the more spiritually developed the individual
from whom it emanates. With very wicked
people it is very dark, sometimes almost black.
The various colors are described as red, yel-
low, blue, green, etc., and indicate the general
temperament and disposition of the person
exhaling it. They may change suddenly as the
thought and feeling of the radiating person
change. They are affected by gusts of anger,
envy, jealousy, or by uprushes of pity, love
or exaltation. It is interesting to note that
the old expression, "green with jealousy," has
a basis in fact, for feelings of jealousy give a
greenish shade to the aura. I once had a friend
who was a very ine clairvoyant for auras.
He could sit in church and during the service
see all the auras of all the people about him,
and so could read their general natures and
even the dominant frames of mind they were
in at the time.
The different phases of mediumship, and the
degree of unfoldment in these phases, are no-
ticeable in the quality and color of the auras.
These auras are like electric signs to spirits
visiting the people of earth. Through them
they are able to select the type of medium they
can work with best, and are able to detect pos-
sibilities of unusual and superior unfoldment
in mediumship.

XX.-Psychometry
These auras leave their impress on all ob-
jects that they touch, much as sounds are im-
pressed on phonographic records, and these
impressions persist for centuries, and even for
many thousands of years. The persons we
call psychometrists or psychometric mediums,
are those able to read these impressions. This
is the basis of the reading of character by
many mediums in circles from holding in their
hands or pressed against their foreheads rings
and watches and jack-knives, etc., belonging
to the sitters. William Denton, the geologist,
and _loseph Rodes Buchanan, were the BISI
to make an exhaustive study of Psychometry,
Mrs. Denton being an unusually good psy-
chometrist. Psychometry is frequently blend-
ed with other phases of mediumship, as where
a medium holding a watch which belonged
to a sitter's father, after giving a description
of the father proceeds to give a message of
an evidential character from him as to an event
that happened since his leaving the physical
body.
Prof. Denton in his experiments with his
wife used to Wrap up a number of geological
specimens, properly numbered so that he
would not know which piece of rock she held
in her hand, thus shutting out the possibility
of telepathy, and then write down what she
described for No. 1, No. 2, etc., neither of
them looking at the specimens until the seance
was over. She used to describe the various
scenes, the kind of prehistoric animals that
were roaming about when the rock from which
the specimen came was being formed. So far
as he could judge she never made a mistake.
This would look as though these prehistoric
animals had auras which were able to be reg-
istered on surrounding objects. This seems
incredible, but how else are the facts to be ex-
plained? It may be, of course, that some geol-
ogist attracted to Prof. Denton from the Spirit
World, seeing the specimen in the medium's
hand, impressed the appropriate pictures on
her mind.

XXI.-No Mutilated Bodies
The spirit body is not affected by surgical
operations or loss of arms and legs in battle.
It is only a portion of the physical body that
is taken away. The spirit body remains intact.
So with the loss of teeth. There are no den-
tists or surgeons practicing their professions
in the Spirit World. I have a friend who lost
a thumb in the World War, and he never no-
tices it or has any sensation as to it when in
normal condition, but as soon as he is con-
trolled and his spirit body is keyed up to a
greater intensity, he feels
seems just as real as the
Clairvoyants often see old
or arm absent, but those
given to the medium for
poses. When the medium
his thumb and it
rest of his fingers.
soldiers with a leg
are spirit pictures
identification pur-
actually sees spirit
soldiers themselves they are always complete
as to body, with no mutilations whatsoever.
So violent deaths have no permanent effect
on the spirit bodies of the victims. When one
is killed by fire and the physical body is con-
sumed, it has no effect on the spirit body.
When one is frozen to death in the far North
no ill effects are left on the spirit body. The
intense heat or cold is in our pitch of vibra-
tion, a physical condition, and does not extend
to the finer pitches of vibration which obtain
in the Spirit Vorld. So with death from sud-
den explosions, the effect on the spirit body is
only temporary in its nature.
Andrew Jackson Davis describes in one of
his books his experience in watching clairvoy-
antly the results on the spirit body of a prema-
ture explosion of a blast in sinking a well. In
the course of a half hour, about two feet above
the ground where the cave-in had taken place,
there began to gather what looked like a fine
white mist. This cloudy substance gradually
formed into a human shape, growing clearer in
outline and more substantial in appearance.
Finally it took on the exact likeness of the man
killed, became animated with vitality, in fact
became the real spirit body of the victim, and
was taken away by his friends who had come
to welcome him to his new world.

xx11.-Msaiummp in me spirit warm
Mental mediumship' is based upon a sensi-
tiveness of the spirit body, so it is a natural
power or faculty that survives in the Spirit
World. If one is a medium here, he will be a
medium there, and he will get in touch with
those in the Second Zone, who can not con-
veniently descend to the First Zone, and will
give messages to their friends who are about
him, just as he used to get in touch with those
in the First Zone and give messages to their
earthly friends. Especially will he get help in
teaching the new arrivals truths beyond his
own experience.
Here on earth there is a wide difference in
the degree of unfoldment that certain faculties
of each of us have attained from what the rest
of our faculties have attained. So it is with
our faculties in the Spirit World. We shall
each find that certain centers of our spirit
brains are developed way beyond the other
centers, and that these differ with each indi-
vidual. Most of our powers will be adapted
to harmonize with conditions in the First Zone,
and with the majority of us all of our powers
will be so adapted, but a few powers of a few
of us will be very much more highly attuned
than this, and will be able to receive currents
of force and ranges of thought from the next
Zone above. These are the faculties that we
call mediumistic, and will be able to be im-
pressed by teachers in the Second Zone, and
occasionally by teachers in the Third and
Fourth Zones. Any impression from a Zone
above, which is received on a Zone below, is
received through mediumship.
Advanced spirits do not always _d_escend to
Zones below and materialize to hold classes,
but sometimes broadcast lessons at stated times
by thought wave, and sometimesa dozen and
sometimes a hundred with suflicient medium-
ship and of the right kind, on the Zone next
below, tune in on these thought waves and get
as much of the lesson as they can. While this
method is not used in teaching ordinary spirits,

it is one of the many ways of teaching the
mediumistic in the Spin World.
Thus mediumship her on earth survives in-
to the Spirit World, and continues to be a
means of receiving truth in all the lower Zones,
and the more highly it is unfolded the wider the
range of truth received, and the more exalted
the source.
XXIII.-Mortals Visit Lower Zones
Some of our highly developed mediums oc-
casionally are taken out of their bodies by
their controls, and conducted to distant spots
here on the face of the earth and sometimes to
the Spirit World. Some of the controls keep
in touch with the physical body and keep it
functioning while this excursion is in progress.
All the mediums and spirits connected with
these experiments describe a magnetic con-
nection resembling a white cord, between the
physical body and the 'spirit body of the medi-
um who is out of the physical body on these
trips. It is necessary that this connection be
not broken, else it is impossible to return to
the physical body. There is great danger at-
tending this experiment, and so it is only un-
dertaken by the most experienced controls,
and then only rarely. The purpose seems to
be to give the -mediums a more vivid knowl-
edge of the relationship between their physical
and spirit bodies, and a clearer grasp of the
realities of the Spirit World.
Once at Etna a friend of mine was giving a
trance lecture to the audience. One of his
controls was doing the speaking, and while the
lecture was going on another medium in the
audience saw the spirit 'body of my friend
walk away from his physical body, and sit
down in a chair some ten or fifteen feet dis-
tant on the platform. He sat there some
fifteen minutes before returning to his phy-
sical body.
The remarkable medium that I have men-
tioned above, whose control lives in the Fourth
Zone, was taken out of his body a few years
ago by this control and taken to the Third
Zone to visit the medium's mother. The con-

trol kept immediately behind the spirit body
of the medium, with the fore-finger of either
hand under each of his arms, and kept him
under that degree of subjection that he, the
control, could speed up or reduce the medi-
um's pitch of vibration to correspond to that
of the Zone they were entering or passing
through. The medium visited in his mother's
home, tal-ked with her and with some of the
children she was teaching. His mother's
home was situated on a hillside overlooking
a beautiful valley. On another hill across the
valley he could see several school buildings,
and noted their wonderful architecture. His
mother's house was -built of an opalescent sub-
stance which admitted the light, and through
which one could see out, but those without
could not see in. It was surrounded by a very
attractive garden. Altogether he was out of
his body about half an hour. Ordinarily me-
diums are not taken to Zones above the First.
XXIV.-Materialization
In this section, and for several sections to
follow, I purpose to touch 'briefly on some of
the leading phases of" phenomena.
While there are some closely allied phenom-
ena that come under the same general head-
ing, materilization, strictly speaking, is where
a spirit body takes on a material substance,
becomes solid, and seems to our physical senses
as tangible and real as do the bodies of any of
our earthly friends. This process may be just
for a portion of the body, as a hand or bust or
mask, or it may be the whole body. None
of the spirit people that we have known, and
who have been gone only a few years, are
able to do this by themselves, but this is done
for them by a group of spirits who have been
long in the Spirit World, and have made a
special study of the processes involved. First,
the spirit body of the one to be materialized
is reduced in pitch of vibration to that ap-
proaching the vibration of the material world,
and becomes etherialized to the solidity of
smoke or vapor, then ectoplasmic substance,
made up by combining matter drawn from

the medium and sitters with substance brought
from the Spirit World, is imposed upon and
blended with the coarsened body of the ma-
terialized spirit, and is thoroughly vitalized by
forces of that spirit and by forces added by
the materializing group. The result' is that for
the time being the spirit seems just like any
member of the circle.
'
f The spirit Katie King in Sir William
Crookes' seances walked and talked about the
seance room, sang, was weighed and measured
and photographed, and during her many ap-
pearances, once or twice a week for many
months, displayed such a friendly personality
that all the circle became very fond of her and
were saddened when she announced that her
work with them was
done,
"At one of Ada Bessinet's seances at Toledo
I was present in 1926 when Dr. Warne came,
materialized as to mask of face and bust, il-
luminated by a spirit light, and smiled and
spoke to Whitwell and Grimshaw a few sen-
tences in a manner and voice perfectly natural
to him, relating to matters coming before the
National Convention a day or two ahead. At
this same seance a spirit man and a spirit
woman materialized to such an extent that
they sang a beautiful duet in full and rich
tones and loud enough to fill the room with
music.
Sometimes a spirit body is materialized only
as to a hand, the rest of the body remaining
invisible to the physical eyes. Frequently such
a hand will write with a pencil, as in the Koons
circles in Ohio in the Fifties, and as in a seance
conducted by P. L. O. A. Keeler in Washing-
ton in the winter of 1886-87 on a pad of paper
held by Alfred Russel Vallace.
Often there is the phenomenon of partial
forms, sometimes of only one -side of a head,
often recognized as a likeness of some spirit
friend of one of the sitters, which seem stiff
and inanimate and do not seem to be vitalized
by a spirit body, and are probably more in the
nature of modeling or sculpture work of spirit

artists than true partial materializations of
spirit bodies.
One of the advantages of materialization is
that it appeals to the ordinary physical senses,
and can be observed by any one whether me-
diumistic or not. It is for the benefit of that
class of people that William James used to call
the tough-minded. _
XXV.-Passing Matter Through Matter
Some of the principles of materialization
overlap into other phases of phenomena, and
they do so in that known as passing physical
matter through other physical matter. Zollner
of Leipsic in his seances with Slade repeatedly
had knots tied in the loop of a string, both
ends of which were sealed to a card that lay
on the table all during the seance. On an-
other occasion he found a marked sheet of
paper on which a message was written to a
fellow Leipsic professor, by the professor's
father in the Spirit World, between a set of
slates sealed together by this professor and
sent into the seance.
Prof. Hare of the University of Pennsyl-
vania had had a number of instances of large
marbles -being found inside small-mouthed
bottles in dark seances, and with the control's
approval had a light-proof box, some three feet
square, constructed for use at seances con-
ducted in a brilliantly lighted room. He
placed three pieces of a steel rod, a quarter of
an inch through and three or four inches long,
inside the box, together with three glass tubes
slightly longer and thicker through and closed
at both ends, and then locked the box putting
the key in his pocket. The circle of eight or
ten people sat around the table on which the
box was placed. The medium placed his hand
on top of the box for a few minutes until the
control announced that the experiment was
over. Immediately the box was unlocked and
opened and each of the pieces of steel was
found inside of one of the glass tubes.
The controls say that all of this sort of
phenomena is produced by distintegrating the

atoms of one substance and re-integrating
them again in the desired new position. So
far as we know heat is required to distinteg-
rate atoms. There may be other ways. But
one point in one of Zollner's experiments has
not been e-mphasized as it 'should be. In con-
ducting some other experiments with a slate
held up against the under side of the table
top, a small shell inside of a larger shell had
been left standing on the top of the table rest-
ing on the openings of both shells. A little
noise was heard on the slate, and on its re-
moval the small shell was
found on the slate.
One of Zollner's friends started to pick it up
and it was so hot that it burned his fingers.
The shell had been taken down through the
solid top of the table.
XXVI.-Apports
Similar principles are employed in the phe-
nomena of apports. The phenomena of apports
consist in physical objects being brought by
spirit power from a distance to the seance
room, often for many hundreds of miles. Court-
ney of the National Board and his wife and a
half dozen friends were holding a dark seance
in the attic room of their camp in the moun-
tains back from Los Angeles. This room had
been screened in with fine meshed copper
screening to keep out insects. During the
seance a big bunch of magnificent flowers,
fresh and covered with dew, were dropped on
the table and in their laps. There were no
such flowers growing within several miles of
their Camp.
Col. Olcott relates an experience while he
was studying Spiritualism, and before he drift-
ed away into Theosophy. He went out to a
greenhouse in Forest Hills, outside Boston,
and marked a leaf on a plant with his initials.
During the seance that night in Boston among
the apports this leaf, with his initials still on
it, was placed in his hand.
Perhaps Bailey, the Australian medium, was
the greatest apportist in recent times. In his
seances Babylonian tablets, mandarin's but-
tons, living birds and tortoises, native only to

Asia, were
frequently brought. Sir Conan
Doyle says in his Wandering; of a Spiritualirt
that there appeared at two of Bailey's seances
that he attended, two live tortoises from
Benares, fifty-two Turkish copper coins, and
a bird's nest with a fresh egg in it from India.
In all these apport cases there is the element
of transportation from long distances, com-
bined with the passing of the apported objects
through the walls on
reaching the house
where the seance was held.
XXVII.-Levitation
Those phenomena where persons or objects
are lifted up into the air by spirit power are
called levitation. One of the best known cases
is that when D. D. Home at Ashley Place,
London, who, in the presence of the Master of
Lindsay, the Earl of Dunraven, Lord Adare,
Capt. Wynne, and several other distinguished
men, was lifted and his body passed out of
one open window and in at another, some
sixty feet from the ground. This phase of
phenomena has been rather common, a great
many cases being recorded in the books, and
a great many more related in private conver-
sation among well known Spiritualists. Grim-
shaw relates that in the early days of his
mediumship he was frequently lifted to the
ceiling of the seance room, where he was in
the habit of making a mark with a pencil that
could be identified by all who wished to ex-
amine it after the seance closed. Alfred Rus-
sel Wallace reports an instance in his auto-
biography where Miss Nichol, the celebrated
English medium, seated in a chair with eight
or ten others about a table at a seance, was
lifted up, chair and all, and placed in the mid-
dle of the table to the great astonishment of
all those present.
What seems the most remarkable case on
record is related in the New York Sun, as
taking place in London, June 3, 1871, where
Mrs. Guppy, who formerly was the Miss
Nichol mentioned above, was entranced and
carried through the air a distance of four miles,
from the Guppy residence at Highbury Hill

Park, where she was entranced while making
up her household accounts, to 61 Lambs Con-
duit Street, where she was brought through
the walls of a closed and locked room and
placed on a table, at which ten persons were
conducting a circle, with her account-book still
in one hand and her pen in the other, the ink
on which was still liquid. The last case in-
volves three kinds of phenomena, that of levi-
tation, that of apports, and that of passing
matter through matter.
Of a similar nature are the cases where a
heavy inaminate object is suspended in the air
for several seconds. Robert Dale Owens re-
cords in his Debatable Land an instance
where, in the presence of Leah Underhill and
Kate Fox, a solid mahogany dining table
weighing one hundred and twenty pounds was
suspended in the air without contact with any
of the persons present.
Sir William Crooks relates in his Rerearcher
that he and several others at a dinner table
in his own home saw a luminous cloud gather
near a heliotrope plant over by the window,
saw a hand extend from this cloud, pick off
a blossom from the plant, and the whole
cloud, hand and blossom, move slowly across
the room and lay the flower on the dining
table.
XXVIII.-Spirit Pictures
There are four distinct classes of phenomena
covering the production of pictures by spirit
power.
First, there is the case of a medium's being
controlled and painting or drawing pictures
while in an unconscious condition. Louis jones,
the New England medium, used to do a great
deal of trance painting in the Nineties. There
are now on exhibition at Metapsychical In-
stitute at Paris more than forty paintings, pro-
nounced by art critics to be of very superior
quality, executed by a coal miner while fully
entranced, who in normal capacity knows
nothing whatsoever of art and has never taken
a lesson in painting.

Second, there is spirit photography, where a
spirit body becomes etherealized sufficiently so
as to affect the photographic plate by the ordi-
nary laws of physical light. The spirit usually
stands by his earthly friend, and both are pho-
tographed together. Mumler in America and
Hope in England were two of the best known
mediums for this kind of work.
Third, there is what is known as a psycho-
graphic picture. That is where there is no ex-
posure of the plate to physical light at all,
and no camera used, but where the plate is
kept in the holder all the time, and the medium
places his hand on the outside of the holder,
just as he places his hand on the outside of the
folding slates in slate-writing phenomena. The
picture of the spirit face or full form is im-
pressed on the plate by spirit light. Dr.
Hooper of Birmingham, England, used to get
psychographs quite frequently.
Fourth, there is the phenomena known as
precipitation of pictures. The famous Bangs
Sisters of Chicago were among the best known
for this kind of work. They used to sit with
the sunlight pouring in at the windows, one of
them on either side of a small table, over which
the blank canvas, often brought by the sitter,
wa-s held upright by a hand of either medium
on the frame of the canvas, with the sitter in a
chair in front where he could watch the de-
velopment of the picture. Slowly the outline
of the face of the spirit friend of the sitter
appeared on the canvas, then the features
became perfected, then the colors were added,
and lastly the eyes would open. Hundreds of
perfect likenesses of spirit people, many of
whom had never had a photograph taken, were
thus produced by the pigments being precipi-
tated by the controls on the canvases, the
usual time being less than half an hour.
XXIX.-Independent Writing
Independent writing, often called direct writ-
ing, is that phase of phenomena where writing
is produced by spirit power, without the con-
tact of a physical hand. A fine case is de-
scribed in TH1: NATIQNAL SPIRITUALIST for

October 1935 by President Whitwell, with P.
L. O. A. Keeler of Washington and Lily Dale
as medium. This fine old medium has been
getting these remarkable phenomena for over
fifty years, and is the best known independent
writing medium in America.
At the Boston National Convention in 1914,
I was a member of the committee that cleaned
the slates for the public demonstration at the
close of one of the lectures. Thirteen pairs of
slates were washed and dried and tied together
in pairs, with a bit of slate-pencil between each
pair, and placed on a table in a pile, on which
Mr. Keeler placed his hand for the purpose of
magnetizing the -slates, while he gave clairvoy-
ant messages to the audience. After about ten
minutes, we on the platform, the National
Board and four or five State Association
presidents, stood about in a circle, with a
slate held by each of us, by opposite cor-
ners. Mr. Keeler stepped forward and took
hold of a slate with either hand, thus corn-
pleting the circle. Scarcely had the circle been
completed before we all heard the pencils writ-
ing between the slates all around the circle.
In less than two minutes Mr. Keeler announced
that the seance was over. All the slates were
brought forward and placed on the table. I
personally cut the strings and opened the
slates, and from one to four messages were
found in different handwritings on eleven out
of the thirteen pairs of slates.
Zollner reports several remarkable messages
found on slates that he himself had sealed to-
gether, obtained during his experiences with
Slade.
Dr. Austin, the old editor of Reafon told
me of a remarkable instance that occurred at
a seance which he attended. He had a class-
mate at college many years before, when they
were both young men, who took with him a
special course in Syriac. On opening the
slates he found five or six sheets of paper, let-
ter size, which he had placed between the
slates, all covered with a long letter to him in
the Syriac language, with the ink still wet, and
signed with the name of his old college chum.

This last case, and the numerous cases where
pictures used to come on papers between slates,
as with Fred Evans of California, look as
though sometimes the principles of precipita-
tion were used in connection with the princi-
ples employed in ordinary writing between
slates.
XXX.-Spirit Lights
When a medium sees lights clairvoyantly
and others in the circle do not see them, or
when he sees the brilliantly colored aura of
a spirit for-m or the dull colored aura of the
spirit body in a physical form, he is of course
seeing spirit lights; but what is meant by spirit
lights as a phenomenon of Spiritualism, is
where lights are produced by spirit power that
are visible to all the circle with their physical
eyes.
°
Spirit lights are rather common in circles
where physical phenomena are produced, and
the books are full of accounts of them. They
partake of the nature of physical phenomena;
that is they are produced by combining phy-
sical forces with forces brought from the Spirit
World, so as to make a light material enough
to impress our physical senses. They are of
all sizes, shapes and colors. The greatest dis-
play of spirit lights that I ever saw was in the
Bessinet circle referred to above. They ranged
in size from that of a pea to that of a turkey's
egg. There were hundreds of them. The
smaller ones flashed out like stars, brilliant
with piercing rays. The larger ones floated
about in the atmosphere with a soft, mellow
light, some lasting a half minute or more. Al-
ways when a face appeared a light would ap-
pear below it and plainly illuminate it so that
the features stood out clearly.
Robert Dale Owen in his Debatable Land
reports that he saw a materialized hand writ-
ing a message on a piece of paper that he had
supplied with identification marks upon it, by
means of a spirit light close to the hand.
One of the purposes of spirit lights seems to
be to supply the investigator with a means of
seeing certain phenomena that could not be

produced in the vibrations of an ordinary ma-
terial light. Certain kinds of material light are
not as destructive as others. An electric light
with a red bulb is less destructive than those
with colors of a finer vibration. Fair results
have been recently obtained at the Metap-
sychical Institute in Paris by means of a light
from a globe filled with lightning-bugs.
XXXI.-Transiguration
Transfiguration is that phase of phenomena
where the face or form of the medium is trans-
formed, that is changed in expression or shape
to resemble that of the controlling spirit. It
partakes of the principles of materialization.
What takes place is that the physical features
or body of the medium is dematerialized and
reformed temporarily on the model of the
spirit body of the control. It used to be
rather common in the early days of Spiritual-
ism. It was only attempted by the controls
of those mediums who possessed a great
amount of materializing power.
Frank A. Bishop, formerly secretary of Etna
Camp and a very competent student of Spirit-
ualism, told me of a very remarkable case that
he observed years ago in Maine at one of the
Old-time circles, where Amelia Gould Stevens,
a celebrated medium of the old days, was the
psychic. Her face and head were completely
transformed into those of an American Indian,
with long black hair, high cheek bones, black
eyes, and a deep copper-colored skin. Some
dozen people in the circle observed it and com-
mented on it. The transformation was rather
startling, as Mrs. Stevens had blue eyes and a
light, fair complexion.
Florence Becker of San Francisco told me a
few years ago that she was in a circle a little
while before where one of her friends, a smooth
faced man, was transiigured into an oldish man
with long, flowing beard.
I am inclined to believe that a knowledge
of transfiguration would have explained many
cases where investigators thought they had
caught the medium faking materialization. As
a matter of fact the phenomena were genuine,

but the sitters were too ignorant of the subject
to recognize it, and concluded as the mediurn's
body was used that it must have been faked
phenomena.
XXXII.-Records in Wax
Among the more impressive and, if they
stood alone, well-nigh convincing bodies of
evidence, are the permanent records of phy-
sical phenomena obtained in wax. These rec-
ords are mostly confined to three phases of
phenomena, the independent voice, finger-
prints and paraffin gloves.
Dr. Crandon succeeded in getting a phono-
graph record of the voice of Walter, Margery's
brother and principal control, which he used
in connection with his address at the National
Spiritualist Convention in Boston in 1929. One
of the most interesting facts in that informa-
tive book, Station Astral by Bessie Clarke
Drouet, is that her circle obtained a phono-
graphic record of the voices of several spirits
who had been talking to the circle for months
in a remarkable series of seances in the inde-
pendent voice. It is to be noted that these
voices were not just any human voices, but
were recognized by all their friends as the ex-
act and natural voices of the spirits doing the
talking, with all the peculiarities of quality
and tone that constitute the unique nature of
each human voice. They were not voices
something like those of their spirit friends, but
they were actually the voices of those friends,
unique and unmistakable.
Among the varied and remarkable phenom-
ena of the Margery seances were the finger-
prints in wax of Walter and one or two
other spirits. They obtained thumb-prints
of Walter a number of times which looked
like ordinary thumb-prints. Then they ob-
tained one which Was a mirror-reverse, that
is, when held up to a mirror the reflection
looked like the first ones, but looked at with-
out the mirror, the right side was where the
left ought to be and vice Versa. All the marks
and lines were identical but reversed in posi-
tion. This was rather staggering to the critics.

As if to confound hostile criticism still more,
and in line with Walter's chuckling comment
in independent voice he succeeded in produ-
cing the same thumb-print upside down, that
is the same thumb-print was there with all its
familiar lines, but not in concave, but in con-
vex, not a hollow in the wax, but a mound,
with the ball of the thumb upward. I see no
way that this can possibly be done except by
a die made in the Spirit World, and material-
ized here and pressed into the wax.
At Walter's suggestion a thumb-print was
obtained from his razor with which he shaved
the morning before he was killed in a railway
accident. This print has been compared with
one o'btained in the seances, by finger-print
experts in Washington, Paris and London, and
the authorities, without knowing the source of
the prints, declare there is no possible doubt
that the same thumb made both impressions.
Dr. Geley of the Metapsychic Institute of
Paris gathered some very remarkable evidence
in the way of parafiin gloves. Kluski, the
Polish medium, under the direction of Geley,
was perhaps the most successful in obtaining
these phenomena. The method was to have
buckets of warm paraffin in the materializing
seance room, and to ask the materialized spirit
to plunge his hand up to the wrist into the
warm paraffin, and then pull it out and plunge
it into cold water for the wax to cool, and re-
peat several times until the paraffin covering
became of sufficient thickness, when the hand
would be dematerialized leaving a perfect
glove. These gloves were then filled with plas-
ter of Paris, the wax melted away, and Geley
had perfect molds of the materialized spirit
hands. These gloves fitting tightly about the
materialized wrists, and some of them made
over hands partially closed, are the despair of
hostile critics. Nothing can explain a paraffin
glove but a materialized spirit hand.
Dr. Geley's death was the most dramatic
thing in all history. He was returning by aero-
plane to Paris from a trip on which he had
obtained a new collection of paraffin gloves.
He was examining one of the gloves when the

crash came. When the body was recovered
the glove was in his hand, and strangely enough
was unbroken. This is the first time in all the
ages that a man left his physical body and
entered the Spirit World while holding in his
very hands the absolute, scientific proof of im-
mortality.
XXXIII.-Foreseeing Future Events
Among the most baffling phenomena of Spir-
itualism is the foreknowledge of future events
disclosed by some mediums. Clairvoyant me-
diums sometimes see clear-cut and definite pic-
tures of events not due to happen for weeks or
months or years, with generally some few
words heard clairaudiently to indicate the time.
Sometimes this is not impressed on the medi-
um's consciousness, but is shown by some of
the more advanced 'spirits to one of the medi-
um's band who takes control and describes the
picture seen or repeats the words heard. The
control explains that he himself knows nothing
about it, but just describes what he sees as a
picture, and often the picture seems like a
moving picture in a mirror with a frame
around it. Generally the control has no idea
what spirit is sending the picture or the words
of explanation. Most prophecies seem to orig-
inate with advanced spirits who relay them
through guides who are fitted to take direct
control of the medium.
For many years I had in my family a very
fine clairvoyant medium with whom I had a
great deal of experience as to foretelling events.
The little Indian girl who generally did the
controlling would often describe the minutest
details as to events, weeks and often years
ahead: such events as there being a pillow of
white flowers with the word "Mother" in
purple letters on the floor at the head of the
casket at a funeral three weeks away; as to
horses on the coaches trotting into our yard at
grandfather's funeral weeks in advance, and as
it turned out it rained the day of the funeral
and the horses did come up to the front door
on the trot for the mourners; as to my being
quite stout and rather grey above the ears

when I arose to speak in the State Senate
twenty years ahead -
and this to a lad of
twenty with no connection with politics-and
accompanying the picture of the Senate Cham-
ber which she described, she heard a voice
say: "Senator Barwise."
Years ago a friend of mine had some doubt
as to whether he ought to start for our Na-
tional Convention, for according to the doctors
his wife would give 'birth to a
baby any day
soon. His principal control entranced him and
said: "Tell the boy to go along to the con-
vention. There is plenty of time. Everything
is all right. The 'baby is a little girl. I see
that she will be born on the ninth day of No-
vember at nine o'clock in the morning." He
went to the convention, was gone a full week,
came home and over a week later the baby was
born on November 9th, and after the ordeal
was over he looked at his watch and as nearly
as he can tell the 'baby was born within two
minutes of nine o'clock.
Every Spiritualist of any experience has
known of events similar to those above men-
tioned, being foreseen down to minute and
trivial details. The thing especially hard for
us to understand is how any spirit, no matter
how advanced in the Upper Zones, is able to
see the small details of events that have not
happened as yet, and do not exist anywhere in
the Universe. The fact that they do see these
events is beyond all question; but how they
do it is another matter.
If we know all the contributory causes of an
event we can predict the result. But in thou-
sands of results foreseen there are insignificant
details for which it would seem to be beyond
the range of possibility to trace out a chain of
unfolding causes. What spirit could know,
and how could he know, that it would shower,
weeks ahead, on the morning of grandfather's
funeral? Or that a pillow of white flowers,
with the word "Mother" in purple flowers,
would be on the floor at the head of the casket
at another funeral three weeks ahead in the
future? Or that I should be elected to the
Senate twenty years after the picture of me

.Q
in the act of speaking there was thrown on
the mind of the Indian control? Or to the
minute weeks ahead when my friend's child
would be born. It would seem that seeing
these details are beyond the powers of any
faculties of mind known to us.
Each of us in soul, spirit body and physical
body, constitutes a magnet unique in its nature,
its affinities, and its range and scope of powers,
that attracts to us those things from out the
surrounding Universe that are attuned to our
dominant pitches of vibration. This is one of
the aspects of the problem that has to be taken
into consideration by those spirits capable of
studying the scope and range of this attractive
power. This is why some of the most ad-
vanced controls of our best mediums refuse
to read for us until they have had an oppor-
tunity to make this special study. When less
developed controls attempt the reading they
generally fail as to foretelling future events,
unless they have the assistance of other ad-
vanced spirits who have more extended powers
and have made the necessary study.
As we advance to the Third and Fourth
Zones we unfold additional faculties of mind,
powers wholly new to us, as the power of cre-
ating flowers or garments by the force of
thought, referred to in an earlier section. It
would seem that this ability to foresee events
in all their details must be the product of these
new faculties of mind which the more advanced
spirits enjoy, and with which they are able
to study the nature and extent of our indi-
vidual powers of attraction, their range and
scope. Perhaps the reason that it is so hard
for us to understand it now is that we have
no faculties here with which we can compare
those new and wonderful faculties which have
blossomed forth in the minds of our more ex-
alted spirit teachers, and which I am suggest-
ing may be the means of their being able to
foresee and foretell events far in our future.
XXXIV.-Language in the Spirit World

of the Spirit World differs from earth language,
as though spirits forgot their native language
on
entering the Spirit World. This is not
true. Every spir-it on entering the First Zone
talks with his old friends in the same language
they always used while here. He reads books
in any language he read while here. He re-
tains all his peculiarities of expression, retains
his same accents and intonations and habits of
idiom, that he grew accustomed to while here.
Spirits of course may learn languages other
than their own, just as we do here. If they
have an interest in other languages, or an oc-
casion to use them, they study them. Controls
of other nations and races generally learn to
speak the language of their mediums, but some-
times one refuses to do so, and when he speaks
through his medium in his own language it has
to be interpreted by some of the other mem-
bers of the band. One of the interesting fea-
tures of the phenomena of controls is to watch
the progress from month to month that many
of them, especially the Indian controls, make
in mastering the language of the medium and
sitters. The English of the Indian controls
often remains somewhat broken for years, but
with many of them it becomes surprisingly
perfect in grammatical form and fluent in range
and precision.
It is to be noted that controls are often
hindered in their accuracy of statement when
using the language of the medium by the limi-
tations of the medium's capacity for use of
language. If the control needs to use a word
that is new to the consciousness of the medium,
his grip on that consciousness may not be
strong enough to force that word through, and
he has to use some word less suitable to ex-
press the exact shade of meaning desired. If
the medium's mind is habituated to bad gram-
matical expression, such as "they was," no
matter how accurately the phrase was reflected
on the mind of the medium that habit is apt
to obtrude itself and the expression come
through "they was." When the control is able
to get sufiicient grip on the medium to use his
own language, when that language is wholly

unknown to the medium, no bad habits can
interfere, and the control's flow of words will
be easy and natural.
After a spirit has been in the Spirit World
a long time, and has advanced to the Third or
Fourth Zone, his telepathic powers become
greatly unfolded, 'both of sending and receiving,
so that he is able to exchange thought without
words to a considerable extent with those on
his plane of unfoldment, but this is not a new
language, 'but merely a new method of com-
munication, as the telephone differs from the
telegraph. But even in advanced conditions
when spirits wish to be very accurate and pre-
cise they use vocal or written language just as
we do' here.
There are all degrees of control, from the
slightest to the very complete. Consequently
some controls are not able to impress the
precise verbal form of the idea to be conveyed
on the mind of the medium. They impress
the general idea and it comes forth in the
words that the medium is in the habit of
using, very fine ideas in very poor language.
Then, too, ideas that are fixed in the medium's
mind are apt to bother the control, and the
production is a mixture of the spirit's ideas
and the medium's ideas.
xxxv-Evil spirits
We hear a good deal of talk among a certain
class of Spiritualists about evil spirits, and
about how a good many people are obsessed
by such spirits to their great injury and to the
annoyance of their friends. Most of the teach-
ing about evil spirits is untrue, and with what
little of it is based on experiential facts, the
facts themselves have been misunderstood and
the real explanation has been misconstrued.
In the fir-st place there are no evil spirits as
understood in orthodox Christianity, as imps
or devils or beings separate and apart from
human beings and created and allowed to exist
for the purpose of causing evil in the world.
Ideas of such beings grew up in relation to the
myth of the orthodox Hell, and have persisted
among those who have not outgrown that

myth. Christians have always taught and in-
sisted on the truth of the Gadarene swine
story, and the universal belief in witchcraft
down to the time of Sir Isaac Newton kept the
idea of evil spirits fresh and potent in the
popular mind.
There are evil men and women in the Spirit
World, because we are constantly sending them
over-gangsters, racketeers, kidnapers and all
sorts of hardened criminals-but they are in
such a darkened condition, so spiritually blind,
so unacquainted with psychic laws, that they
are unable to contact or influence mediumistic
persons. They are all taken in charge by their
relatives and friends who have gone before,
and after long years of treatment by friends
and of endeavors on their own part, they are
able to work out of their darkened condition
and to unfold their spirit-faculties, but by that
time they have outgrown their evil desires and
have become respectable people in their new
world. Those that are evil enough so that they
have a desire to injure people, so they would
derive pleasure from doing harm, are rendered
-harmless by the weakness of their own spirit
senses, by their inability to do what they might
want to do. -
There are a few spirits who go over with an
uncontrollable thirst for liquor or hankering
for drugs, who havenit outgrown this thirst
or hankering and who keep close to the pres-
ence of their loved ones left behind. Some-
times if those left behind are psychically sensi-
tive they will absorb this thirst or hankering
and will start using liquor or drugs, without
any evil intent on the part of this spirit. I
have known one or two cases of this kind, but
these are generally taken in charge by the
guides and no great harm is done. As a rule
spirits needing treatment are taken to sani-
toriums, and this is more and more the rule
as the years go by. They are learning to han-
dle these cases better on the Other Side than
formerly. And as to those few not so handled
it must be borne in mind that for the most
part very few of the relatives left behind would
be sensitive enough to absorb evil appetites

from the auras of spirits hovering about.
The greatest danger is from autohypnosis,
from weak and nervous people hypnotizing
themselves. This is what largely took place
in the witchcraft days. They get to believing
that they are under the influence of evil spirits,
and they may actually feel some spirit power,
but their conduct is almost entirely the result
of self-imposed, semi-trance conditions. What
they need is to be taken in charge of some good
medium that has a control that understands
and is adapted to the development of real
mediumship. Thus a proper band will be
gathered about the patient, and if he is suffi-
ciently mediumistic -his mediumship will be un-
folded, the personality balanced and steadied,
and he will outgrow entirely the difficulty that
he thought was obsession.
But if there should be any possibility of an
undeveloped spirit trying to influence a medi-
um in the beginning of his development, all
that it is necessary to do is to follow the meth-
od that Grimshaw has used for years in his
developing classes-Have all the members of
the circle aflirm two or three times positively
before each sitting -begins, "I refuse to be in-
fluenced by any spirit below me in mind or
character!" Repeat this two or three times
and then forget it, and you each have built up
a wall about you that no inferior spirit can
get through or over. This method is infallible.
It has never been known to fail. It works
absolutely, and does away with what little
danger of obsession there may be, which is
very little at most.
XXXVI.-Afection in the Spirit World
In this, the closing section of this series of
lessonettes, I wish to emphasize the hominess
of the Spirit World. In earlier sections, I
have placed great emphasis on the growth of
the intellect, on the larger mental sweep, on
the expanding grasp of truth, but it must be
stressed that there is an equal growth of the
affectional side of our beings, of the tender side
of our personalities, of the lovable qualities in
our natures in the Spirit World, which we can

scarcely imagine while we remain here. With
the sloughing off of all the coarser sides of
our natures there is a corresponding develop-
ment of all the finer sides, hence a greater
capacity for ine feeling, for tenderness far
beyond what any of us have experienced in
earth life. All of our real friendships will be
renewed and enhanced and deepened. All
those we have ever loved here we shall love
still more Over There, for both we and they
will have a greater capacity for loving.
There used to be considerable emphasis in
lectures on our platform, and in articles in our
Spiritualist papers on the idea of Soul Mates,
that there were certain men and women so
perfectly attuned to each other that they would
be companions through all eternity. This is
an overstatement of the real truth. This is not
what the more advanced controls teach. They
say that couples closely attached here will con-
tinue closely attached so long as their natures
are in attunement, but as no two people are
unfolding at precisely the same rate, as the
centuries go by one member of each couple
will eventually be far in advance of the other,
and perfect attunement will not last indefinite-
ly. When that times comes each will be at-
tracted by new personalities and form new at-
tachments, which will last as long as the com-
panionship of each will be a stimulus and in-
spiration to the other. The very nature of love
is creative. Here t-his creative principle finds
expression in bringing forth children. Over
There love is creative of ideas. Here these
separatings and rematings are accompanied
by jealousy, heartaches and unhappiness. Over
There all parties have outgrown these lower
feelings, and these separations and new com-
panionships are as pleasant and natural as the
return of the flowers of spring, without clash
of feeling, and with a full understanding of the
great spiritual laws involved. Each attach-
ment lasts as long as either party feels the
need of it. Both parties understand that the
flower of love buds and blossoms and fades as
does the rose, but there is no feeling of sorrow

Q
or regret about separating, as each knows that
he or she will retain all the line qualities that
that particular attachment has stimulated into
fruition. Each will retain a real and lasting
friendly feeling for the other, but both realize
that it is no longer as full and complete an ex-
pression of the affectional side of the higher
life as that to which their state of unfoldment
naturally entitles them.
All of those who have had the experience of
family circles in the home, where the controls
have manifested once or twice a week for
many years will recall the devotion of such
controls, the fine grained nature of their per-
sonalities, the remarkable friendships develop-
ed between the sitters and the controls, and
the sweetness and tenderness that pervaded
the atmosphere. All such persons already have
had a foretaste of the delightful relation ex-
isting among friends in the Spirit World. There
is an element about it far surpassing the most
delightful of earthly friendships. General
friendship is on a much more affectionate basis
than here. We feel toward our casual acquain-
tances Over There as we do toward our close
friends here. A general tenderness that all
recognize fills the air as syringa scents an old
fashioned garden. We are all on our way to a
complete satisfaction of both yearnings of life
-our hunger for truth and our hunger for
affection. just as each of us on our intellectual
side will grasp as much truth as our minds can
hold at each stage of our unfoldment, so on the
affectional side of our natures each of us will
bask in the sunshine of that degree and. quality
of love best suited to each stage of our evol-
ing life through the several Zones.

DECLARATIDN 0F PRINCIPLES
Adopted by the
NATIONAL SI'lRI'I`UALIS'l`
ASSOCIATION
_
U. s. A.
1. We believe in Infinite Intelligence.
2. We believe that the phenomena of na-
ture, both physical and spiritual, are the ex-
pression of Infinite Intelligence.
3. We allirm that a correct understanding
of such expression and living in accordance
therewith, constitute true religion.
4. We aliirm that the existence and per-
sonal identity of the individual continue after
the change called death.
5. We alhrm that communication with the
so-called dead is a fact, scientifically proven
by the phenomena of Spiritualism.
6. We believe that the highest morality is
contained in the Golden Rule: "Whatsoever
ye would that others should do unto you, do
ye also unto them."
7. We aiirm the moral responsibility of
the individual, and that he makes his own
happiness or
unhappiness as he obeys or dis-
obeys Nature's physical and spiritual laws.
8. We a$rm that the doorway to reforma-
tion is never closed against any human soul
here or hereafter.

OBJ ECTS OF SPIRITUALISM
The objects of the organized movement of Spirit-
ualism may be stated in part as follows:
To teach the truths and principles expressed in
the Declaration of Principles and in the Definitions
of "SPIRITUALISM," "A SPIRITUALIST," "A
MEDIUM," and "A SPIRITUALIST HEALER,"
as adopted by the National Spiritualist Association
of the United States of America.
To teach and proclaim the science, philosophy
and religion of modern Spiritualism, to encourage
lectures on all subjects pertaining to the Spiritual
and Secular welfare of mankind. To protest against
every attempt to compel mankind to worship God
in any particular or prescribed manner. To advo-
cate and promote spiritual healing and to pro-
tect and encourage spiritual teachers and mediums
in all laudable efforts in giving evidence or proof
to mankind of a continued intercourse and rela-
tionship between the living and the so-called dead.
To encourage every person in holding present be-
liefs always open to re-statement as growing thought
and investigation reveal new truth, thereby leaving
every individual free to follow the dictates of rea-
son and conscience in spiritual as in secular aHaira

WHAT SPIRITUALISM IS AND DOES
lt teaches personal responsibility.
/ft removes all fear of death, which is really the
portal of the spirit world,
It teaches that death is not the cessation of life,
but mere
change of condition.
It teaches, not that a man has a soul, but that
man is a soul, and has a body.
That man is a spiritual being now, even while
encased in flesh.
That as man sows on earth he reaps in the life
to come.
That those who have passed on are conscious-
not asleep.
That communion between the living and the
"dead" is scientifically proved.
It thus brings comfort to the bereaved, and alle-
viates sorrow."
Spiritualism is the Science, Philosophy and Reli-
gion of continuous life, based upon the demon-
strated fact of communication, by means of me-
diumship, with those who live in the Spirit World.
It brings to the surface man's spiritual gifts,
such as inspiration, clairvoyance, clairaudience
and healing powers.
lt teaches that the spark of divinity dwells in all.
That as a flower gradually unfolds in beauty, so
the spirit of man unfolds and develops in the spirit
spheres.
Spiritualism is Cod's message to mortals, declar-
ing that There Is No Death. That all who have
passed on still live. That there is hope in the life
beyond for the most sinful.
That every soul will progress through the ages to
heights, sublime and glorious, where God ls Love
and Love Is Cod.
It is a manifestation, a demonstration, and a
proof of the continuity of life and of the truth of
the many Spirit manifestations recorded in the
Bible.
It demonstrates the many Spiritual gifts with
which mankind is endowed but which through want
of knowledge have been allowed to lay dormant, or
through prejudice have been violently and unjustlv
suppressed.

DEFINITIONS
Adopted by the
`
National Spiritualist Association
Adopted October, 1914, 1919, |930
l. Spiritualism is the Science, Philosophy and
Religion of continuous life, based upon the demon-
strated fact of communication, by means of medium-
ship, with those who live in the Spirit World.
2. A Spiritualist is one who believes, as the basis
oi his or her religion, in the communication be-
tween this and the spirit world by means of
mediumship, and who endeavors to mould his or
her character and conduct in accordance with the
highest teachings derived from such communion.
3. A Medium is one whose organism is sensi~
tive to vibrations from the spirit world, and
through whose instrumentality, intelligences in that
world are able to convey messages and produce
the phenomena of Spiritualism.
4. A Spiritualist healer is one, who either
through his own inherent powers or through his
mediumship, is able to impart vital, curative force
to pathologic conditions.
"Spiritualism ls a Science" because it investi-
gates, analyzes and classifies facts and manifesta-
tions, demonstrated from the spirit side of life.
"Spiritualism Is a Philosophy" because it studies
the laws of nature both on the seen and unseen
sides of life and bases its conclusions upon present
observed facts. It accepts statements of observed
facts of past ages and conclusions drawn therefrom,
when sustained by reason and by results of ob-
served facts of the present day.
"Spiritualism Is a Religion" because it strives to
understand and to comply with the Physical,
Mental and Spiritual Laws of Nature, "which are
the laws of God."

QUOTATIONS
The Man who has constantly contended against evil,
morally and physically, outwardly and inwardly, may fear-
lessly face death, well assured that radiant Spirits will lead
him across the luminous bridge into a paradise of eternal
happiness. Zend-Avesta
The Soul is myself. The body is only my dwelling place.
Death is not death; the Soul merely departs and the body
falls. þÿ ¬`Buddhist
_Scripture
Millions of Spiritual Beings walk the earth, both when
we wake and when we sleep. Hesiod
When thou shalt have laid aside thy body thou shalt rise
freed from mortality and become a God of the kindly skies.
Pythagoras
That which we call death is but a pause or a suspension,
and in truth a progress to life. Seneca
I shall go not only to meet great men, but also my son.
His Spirit, looking back upon me, departed to that place
whither he knew that I should come, and he has never
deserted me. Cato
Is it not strange that after all I have said to convince
you that I am going to the society of the happy you still
think this body to he Socrates. To die and be released is
better for me. Socrates
The Soul of each of us is an immortal Spirit and goes to
other immortals to give an account of its actions Plato
I consider this world as a place nature never intended for
a permanent abode, and I look on my departure from it
as simply leaving an inn. Cicero
In my Father's House are many Mansions. Jesus
Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you
free. Jesus

There are poems unwritten and songs unsung
Sweeter than any that ever were heard,-
Poems that wait for an angel tongue,
Songs that but long for a
paradise bird.
Poems that ripple through lowliest lives,
Poems un-noted, and hidden away
Down in the Souls where the beautiful thrives
Sweetly as flowers in the airs of May.
Poems that only the Angels above us,
Looking down deep in our hearts may behold,
Felt, though unseen by the beings who love us
Written on lives all in letters of Gold.
Selected.

Only a touch, a whisper,
I said would banish unrest;
Only a
glance from the eyes I love
Will make my life so blest.
And I heeded not there that the sun shone fair
And the wind came out of the west.
Only the old-time music
Of songs that my spirit caught,
Only a vanished presence,
Only a loving thought,
And I failed to hear the music near,
With _which the air was fraught.

Night
J* .9
The curtain is drawn on another day,
It has beckoned to shadows so tall,
The sun has gone down in its same old way,
Nigh over the garden wall.
A silence comes o'er me as I review
The way I have spent this time;
Have I tried to serve a limited few
Or humanity's needs as mine?
And if I have tried all I could to obey,
To love and to serve, one and all,
Then I'll be eager and happy to say,
"I'm ready for Night's clear call."
-Otto A. Morton.

So let my friends who look upon my clay
Before the purifying blaze has loosed
Its hold upon my real self,
Co on the even tenor of their way
With neither moan, nor tear, nor fear for me,
Rejoicing that the change has "Made Me Free"
And opened up the door to progress ever more.
If forward turn their thoughts,
I pray them think of me as journeying on
In search of Truth and Love and Beauty,
With less of earthly dross and limitations,
With more of Light and Life and Power,
As I climb the heights.
And so I would that my life, here and there,
Become a lasting benediction to the world.
B. F. AUSTIN, in When I Am Gone
