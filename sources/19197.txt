I was the officer in charge of optical
instrumentation at Vandenberg Air Force
Base in the 1360 ninth photo squadron
and as such it was my duty to supervise
the instrumentation photography of every
missile that went down the Western Test
range in those days we call the my CBMs
intercounty ballistic missiles because
most of the blew up on launch and our
job was to determine why they blew up to
provide the engineers good enough and
engineering sequential photography so
they could see what was wrong with with
the bird as it took off in flight what
we photographed up there affected me for
the rest of my life and made a huge
impact on my understanding of the
universe and of governmental
manipulation of of our minds the purpose
of them was they were ballistic missiles
they were to deliver nuclear weapons on
targets that&#39;s what they were what they
were therefore we weren&#39;t launching real
nuclear weapons we were watching dummy
warheads they were the exact size shape
and dimension and weight of a nuclear
warhead for my stunning achievement in
finding a place where I could look back
at Vandenberg Air Force Base from up
north and for figuring out how to
transmit the timing up there and for
getting the the thing set up I was
awarded the Air Force guided missile
insignia it was the first photographic
officer in the Air Force to get the they
called it the missile badge it was a
highly coveted thing at the time was
definitely in 1964 because florins
Mansmann confirmed that and he knew he
had written it down a knew the exact
date of it they counted down the missile
we heard engine ignition liftoff we knew
the missile was underway and we were
looking down south south west and the
missile popped up through the fog it was
just beautiful and I hollered there it
is then our guys on our m/45 tracking
mount with 180 inch lenses on it got it
and the big bu telescope swung over and
got it and we followed the thing and
sure enough we could see all three
stages of powered Flyers they burned out
and dropped away and then
first our naked I always thought was a
coke trail going off into subspace as it
headed off toward its target which was
an e we talked Island and we talked at
all so we what beating shouted and heard
the film rap off in the in the BU
telescope and figured well that was our
first big deal we got it
we sent the film back down to Vandenberg
and I don&#39;t know exactly how long it was
after the the event it might have been a
day or two I was called in to major
major Mansmann office at the first
strategic aerospace division
headquarters and I walked into his
office and they had a screen and a 16
millimeter projector set up there was a
couch and major management said sit down
and there were two guys as I recall two
guys in grey suits civilian clothes
which was fairly unusual um and a major
Mansmann said watch this and turned on
the film projector and I watched the
screen and there was the launch from the
day or two before it hit Big Sur it was
quite exciting because of the length of
the telescope as the Atlas missile
entered the frame we could see the whole
third stage which is which has two
rocket nozzles like this and one in the
center or gimballed one in the center
fill in our frame from 100 and about 160
miles I was pretty exciting optics we
watched that stage burnout we watched
the second stage burnout we watch the
third stage burnout and into the frame
came something else it flew into the
frame like this and it shot a beam of
light at the warhead which is
represented by my thumb here now
remember all this stuff is flying at
several thousand miles an hour so this
thing fires a beam of light at the
warhead hits it and then this thing
flies up like this meanwhile we&#39;re all
going like this fires another beam of
light goes around like this we&#39;re going
like this fires another beam of light
goes down like this far is another beam
of light and then flies out the way it
came in and the warhead tumbles out of
the outer space
I saw that I don&#39;t give a goddamn what
anybody else says about it I saw that on
film fill class can kiss my ass he
wasn&#39;t there I was when the lights came
on major Mansmann turned around I looked
at me and said were you guys screwing
around up there and I said no sir
and he said what was that and I said it
looks to me like we got a UFO now the
thing that we saw this object that flew
in was circular was shaped like a -
saucers cup like this with a ping-pong
ball on top the Bema light came out of
the ping-pong ball that&#39;s what I saw on
film now major Mansmann said to me after
some discussion about it and he said you
are never to speak of this again as far
as you&#39;re concerned this never happened
and I said well and he said I don&#39;t need
to emphasize the the dire consequences
of a security breach do I I said no sir
and he said fine this never happened so
I started for the door he said wait a
minute he said years from now if you&#39;re
ever forced by someone to talk about
this you ought to tell them it was laser
strikes laser tracking strikes well in
1964 we didn&#39;t have any laser tracking
strikes we didn&#39;t have any laser
tracking at all lasers were in their
infancy in 1964 their old playthings and
laboratories so I said yes sir and
walked out and that was the last I
talked about it for 18 years I didn&#39;t
talk about it to anybody at Vanderburgh
Air Force Base nobody in my squadron
knew about it nobody saw the film but me
my commanding officer major Lou SS
Clement jr. didn&#39;t see it my operations
officer Captain Kenneth R Callaghan
didn&#39;t see it his assistant lieutenant
Ronald Oh Baylor didn&#39;t see it their
assistant Chief Warrant Officer gyeom
Spooner didn&#39;t see it nobody in my
squadron saw it and I didn&#39;t talk about
it anybody under direct orders from
major
Lawrence J Mannesmann jr. consequently
no one at vandenberg that I know of
knows anything about this that sounds
real suspicious doesn&#39;t it somebody
should have seen it somebody should have
talked about it well they didn&#39;t because
in those days I didn&#39;t talk about top
secret things that I was told not to
talk about there are things that I know
about that I did in the service that I
won&#39;t talk about to you now because
they&#39;re top secret and I could get my
ass in trouble for talking about him
after 18 years it occurred to me that I
could talk about this one incident
because nobody ever told me it was
classified top secret if you parse what
major Mansmann said he said you&#39;re to
say this never happened well that&#39;s not
classifying it top secret is it
didn&#39;t happen anybody else it&#39;s not a
secondhand story this happened to me and
I was a part of the United States Air
Force cover-up for 18 years the object
the points of light that we saw the
warhead and so forth were traveling
through subspace about sixty miles
straight up and they were going
somewhere in the neighborhood of eleven
to fourteen thousand miles an hour when
this thing caught up to them flew in
flew around them went like this and flew
back out everything was going to about
to an eleven or fourteen thousand miles
an hour that way it was saucer shaped it
was circular and rounded on the top and
bottom and it had a little dome in the
right straight in the center of it from
which this beam emitted after that
article hit the [ __ ] hit the fan I
started being harassed at work I started
by odd telephone calls would come during
the day at night at my house you know I
would get telephone calls all night long
sometimes three o&#39;clock in the morning
four o&#39;clock in the morning midnight ten
o&#39;clock people would call and start
screaming at me
you&#39;re going down [ __ ] you&#39;re
going down [ __ ] and that&#39;s all
they&#39;d say and they keep screaming that
until I finally hung up the phone one
night somebody blew up my mailbox by
putting a big load of skyrockets in it
the mailbox went up in flames and that
night at one o&#39;clock in the morning the
phone rang I picked it up and somebody
said skyrockets in your box at night oh
what a beautiful sight [ __ ]
and things like that have happened on
and off for since 1982 so I told you
that since this History Channel thing
came up and since you&#39;ve started asking
questions and obviously this this thing
is in the wind again I&#39;m starting to get
telephone calls again my wife and I get
phone calls out here in nowhere Illinois
where we&#39;ve retreated out to our farm
and it&#39;s strange reason cause baby they
don&#39;t say anything they simply you pick
up the
wanna say hello hello and there&#39;s a
click it&#39;s disconcerting but I&#39;ve
learned to not give a flip I just don&#39;t
care anymore
poor thing India kill me are they gonna
do discredit me are they going to do any
more than Philip class has already done
to me are they going to make me look
foolish that&#39;s about all they can do I
believe it&#39;s a belief system line that
this nutty fringe around UFOs is part of
the the sort of concerted effort to keep
serious study of it down anytime anybody
tries to to study this subject seriously
or subject to ridicule I&#39;m a full
professor at a relatively major
university and I&#39;m certain that my
colleagues at the University laugh at me
and hoot and holler behind my back when
they hear that I have an interest in
studying uh uh unidentified flying
objects and that&#39;s just one of the
things that we have to live with was I
in the Air Force the Air Force United
who was I Everett Vanderburgh well of
course I couldn&#39;t because I was in the
Air Force how could I then at vandenberg
did I put a track inside of Big Sur
California no there was no track inside
of Big Sur California which is a crock
the track inside Big Sur California is
still there right where I put it and
they used it to show you every time the
the Space Shuttle lands in California
that&#39;s where you first see it from and
they&#39;re still photographing missiles
from Vandenberg from that tracking site
any rate to corroborate my story Lee
Graham tracked down Lorentz J Mannesmann
jr. the same major who had ordered me to
shut up about it
he was now a PhD from Stanford in
nuclear physics I think I&#39;m not sure
what is what is background was but it
was it was a PhD from from Stanford and
a rancher in Fresno California and he
wrote the lead back saying everything
Bob said in his story is absolutely true
he corroborated my story and he
continued to do that year after year
every time somebody brought her up every
time somebody would contact
he corroborated my story by saying yes
that&#39;s exactly what happened
takes a lot of guts to do that I became
a fan of sunny sees a
now-deceased he was my hero for a while
I wasn&#39;t in the room at the time but
what happened to the film is an
interesting story in itself as major
Mansmann told me and other people some
time after I had gone the guys in
civilian clothes and he said there were
three of them I remember too he said
there were three people from this agency
and I thought it was the CIA he said no
it wasn&#39;t the CIA was somebody else and
I never did find out who it was he said
what happened is this they took the film
and they pulled off the part that had
the UFO on it and they took a pair of
scissors and cut it off they put that on
a separate reel they put it in their
briefcase they handed major Mansmann
back the rest of the film and said here
I don&#39;t need to remind you major
Mansmann of the severity of a security
breach will consider this incident
closed and they walked off with the film
major Mansmann never saw it again
and as far as I&#39;m concerned or nobody
else ever saw it again
certainly not at vandenberg I&#39;m certain
that it let Vandenberg and went
somewhere else major Mansmann who&#39;s a
very good reader of film said that the
feeling at the time was that it must
have been extraterrestrial but they
assumed that the the beam of light that
struck the warhead the dummy warhead was
some sort of plasma beam because it
looked like a plasma beam and they were
assuming that was something like that
major for ins J Mannesmann was a man of
great honor and great scientific
standing in the kin the community for
him to corroborate it he&#39;s good enough
for me even if I didn&#39;t believe myself I
would believe major Mansmann now there
were there were two of us who were Air
Force officers at the time and we saw
something and we have both corroborated
with each other that we saw that but
that&#39;s what we recall from from the
incident what I have to ask skeptics
for people who disbelieve what I&#39;m
saying is why would I make this up
why would major Florence James when dr.
majored Florence Jay man why would he
make it up why what what have we to gain
I&#39;ve made no money from this I&#39;ve got
nothing but pain and suffering out of it
out of talking about it I&#39;ve been
harassed at my home this was used
against me partially and losing a job
once and teaching I&#39;ve had a hell of a
time after I&#39;ve told this story but I
continue to tell the story because I
think it&#39;s important for people to
understand that this sort of [ __ ] goes
on in the government that the government
covers up information that we are
entitled to know about is citizens in
this country that&#39;s why I tell my story
so I&#39;m telling it to you I&#39;ll continue
to tell it as long as I&#39;m alive and I&#39;ll
always tell it the same way because it
only happened one way
I never varied the story because I can&#39;t
it&#39;s the truth and I&#39;ve been the subject
of humiliating letters and phone calls
from from skeptics like James Oberg at
NASA and Philip J class is an idiot paid
Informer to the United States government
who persist in in belittling me and
that&#39;s fine if they want to belittle
belittle meat but dump a little Sonny
Mannesmann the things that were denied
specifically first of all was that I was
ever in the Air Force they had no record
of me I was at Vandenberg null he had no
record of that once we found only was it
matter very well he was never big circus
we don&#39;t have a tracking site a Big Sur
well we proved that that&#39;s the nature of
bureaucratic idiocy your forces position
right now is there was
such incident and there was no film of
it the thing that&#39;s important to me
about this whole operation is very
simply the biggest event in the history
of humankind is the discovery that we
are not alone that there are other
living entities intelligent entities in
this universe or other universes and
that we aren&#39;t here alone that&#39;s a huge
enormous discovery it&#39;s the discovery of
the of the lifetime of humankind isn&#39;t
it to find out that we&#39;re not here alone
that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s important to
talk about these things I think that&#39;s
exciting and I think that it&#39;s important
for us as humans to come to term to grow
up arthur c clarke childhoods end to
grow up and recognize that we may not be
the paragon of animals after all so
maybe something out there that&#39;s bigger
and more exciting than we are and that
just maybe just maybe they&#39;re telling us
something know what I saw that day was
something shooting down a dummy nuclear
warhead what message would I interpret
from that don&#39;t mess with nuclear
warheads that&#39;s probably the message I
would interpret from from that I&#39;d say
oh maybe somebody doesn&#39;t want us
annihilating Moscow maybe we should stop
doing that I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what
that&#39;s what went on but Ronald Reagan
one night went on television needed a
most astonishing thing most astonishing
he stood up in front of America and said
we&#39;re going to build a defensive shield
we&#39;re going to call it SDI the Strategic
Defense Initiative and its mission is
going to be to protect us to protect all
of us
he said Ronald Reagan said we&#39;re going
to share this with everybody we&#39;re going
to share it with the Russians who are
enemies the guys that only a few years
ago we were throwing we were pretending
it to annihilate Oh suddenly we&#39;re going
to
check them with a shield from whom are
we going to protect them I just find
some interesting patterns in life and
that&#39;s one of the patterns that I
thought might be important to perhaps
that was the first shot across the bow a
first warning shot from somebody saying
knock this off kids it&#39;s time to grow up
you don&#39;t want to annihilate this planet
do you could be my take on what happened
there is based on not only my own
speculation but having read other things
and talk to other people over the
intervening years that maybe the whole
thing had something to do with a preview
of the Strategic Defense Initiative for
starters another possibility I suppose
be a few if you agree that perhaps our
paranoia is unfounded and if we
encounter beings with superior
technologies maybe we should embrace
them and be nice to them because they
might be showing us how to survive
something turned those missiles off and
so they could not be put in a mode of
launching when I was a commander of a
radar squadron up in Maine a counseled
Air Force Station Maine we were right
next door to Lauren Air Force Base was
where that launched the b-52s and the KC
tankers and things like that yeah I had
a lot of security friends over there and
Lauren who told me about and I
