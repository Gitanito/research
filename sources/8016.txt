  		              		Experience Description   

    My parents divorced in 1996. For 10 years after that,  my life was a mess.  I divorced in 2002, left my wife and daughter, and was drunk most of the time until 2006. I was diagnosed with a bad gallbladder and acute pancreatitis attack. The doctors  treated me for 2 weeks before the surgery. Right before they took me to surgery room, all I thought was that I had enough of this life. I had nothing to regret, and I thanked my parents in my mind. I felt ready if I was to die that day. 

  I was wondering if  anyone else could see the  smoke or fog? It was like I was in a pitch dark, outer space-like environment.  Yet, I wondered if there was a light somewhere? I don't know. I was floating with peace of mind and nothing to worry about. My mind worked faster than anything, yet I couldn't feel my legs or hands. 

  The operation lasted for about 4 hours.  They woke me up by slapping my cheeks while I was in intensive care. I spent 6 months in the hospital with a cut-open belly and suffering from this sharp pain.  Somehow, I knew I had to fight for my life and get up and walk. 

Everything in my life changed after I got out of the hospital. I got married again, and have two beautiful children. We're living peacefully. I always feel thankful for everything to my ancestors, to somebody or something. I appreciate everything in this world; the flowers, wind, rain; the sun, people and gods.
