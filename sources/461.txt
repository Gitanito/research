 1880--1896  Monthly

 This was intended as a more popular version of the Fowlers' Phrenological Journal and was replete with advertisements for Fowler publications and their institute in London.  Story (1842-1934), in addition to editing this journal, made his living as a journalist and author of books on a variety of subjects, including a biography of John Varley, the friend of Blake, and A Chapter on Noses: Profusely Illustrated.  The journal was included as a premium with membership in the Fowler Institute for the Study and Development of Human Nature in London.  Each issue was graced (as was practically necessary with phrenological journals in general) with a plate of the leading figure analyzed that month, including portraits of W.T. Stead, Thomas Carlyle, Charlotte Fowler Wells, Chinese Gordon, and Cardinal Newman.  Besides the usual phrenological lucubrations on the nature and parameters of the science, the journal regularly carried fiction of a phrenological cast.  With the issue of January 1897, the journal was incorporated with Fowler's other, more "scientific" journal to form The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health, Established 1838, Incorporated with The English Phrenological Magazine, Established 1880, "Devoted to Ethnology, Physiology, Phrenology, Physiognomy, Sociology, Psychology, Education, Mechanical Industry, Hygiene, and to All Those progressive Measures which are Calculated to Reform, Elevate, and Improve Mankind, Spiritually, Intellectually, and Socially."  Noted in "List of Advance Thought Publications," The New Cycle, March 1900, 159-60.  Columbia University; Iona College; National Library of Sweden.
