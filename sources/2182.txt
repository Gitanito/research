SHEFFIELD:
PRINTED BY ROBERT LEADER, INDEPENDENT OFFICE,
1843.
REPORT, &c.
When the objects to be gained, and the methods pur¬
sued, by a Phrenological Society, are taken into consi¬
deration, the first general Report of one newly established
in a populous district, may well be designated a Report
of the Progress of Truth.
In presenting their first Report, your Committee feel
it necessary briefly to allude to the circumstances which
previously occurred, and ultimately gave rise to the for¬
mation of this Society.
In Sheffield, Phrenology had made no stand worthy
of its immense importance. The believers in its truth
were unknown to each other, and hence the impossibility
of ascertaining their united influence. The establishment
of a Society of this nature was latently felt to be a desi¬
deratum in this locality.
Phrenology was first introduced to the public of Shef¬
field by the late Dr. John Overend ; and in the year 1829,
a course of lectures was delivered by Dr. Spurzheim, the
distinguished coadjutor of the illustrious Gall. The in¬
terest taken in it at the time seems to have been neither
great nor lasting ; for, down to the period when the town
was visited by an itinerant quack, the subject remained
in nearly a quiescent state. It was in the defence of
truth, and to counteract the bad effects produced by this
individual’s visit, that a few persons, unconnected, except
B
4
by a common regard for the science of Phrenology, en¬
tered into arrangements for inviting the Rev. D. Gr. Gtoy-
der, A.M., of Glasgow, to deliver a course of lectures,
preparatory to the formation of a Society, if circum¬
stances should warrant it. The lectures succeeded be¬
yond their most sanguine expectations. So altered, in¬
deed, was the state of public feeling, that the very people
who, a few years ago, received the great master himself
with coldness and neglect, rushed in crowds to hear the
same truths from the lips of an humble disciple. The
result wished for, followed. A common centre, where the
lovers of the science could meet, state facts, weigh evi¬
dence, and canvass opinions, became a matter of enquiry.
In this way the Society had its origin.
Its leading objects are, to investigate and spread
abroad thqfacts and the system of Phrenology. To effect
this, various meetings have been regularly held, and public
and private lectures delivered. At the weekly meetings,
papers were read on the different organs of the mind,
calling forth a profitable and often an important discus¬
sion. The lectures being either on subjects of passing
interest, or of fundamental importance, were open to the
members and their friends, or to the public at large,
when the occasion required. These means, with the cir-
culation of charts, books, journals, &c., amongst the
members, and conversational discussions on knotty and
disputed points, have, in the opinion of your Committee,
greatly contributed to clearness of conception, and tended
not a little to awaken an abiding interest in the principles
of the New Philosophy.
The constitution of this Society avoids one of the
chief causes of failure in Phrenological Societies gene¬
rally, viz., exclusiveness. To the medical profession
have these Societies been mostly confined. Useful and
appropriate as the study of the science may be to that
5
branch of the community, still such a course must be dia¬
metrically opposed to an extended utility. The Sheffield
Phrenological Society is open to all who are anxious in
the pursuit of physiologico-mental truth, whether the
professional man, the merchant, or the artizan. Its prin¬
ciples are, however, antagonist to the conceits of those
who, in the face of facts, will, at all risks, tenaciously and
doggedly support antiquated notions or instilled preju-
dices, because believed in, to a certain extent, by the
profession of which they may happen to be members.
Opinions imbedded in prejudice, or crusted over with
conceits, are valueless, as well in the lights of science as
of common sense. Non-professional men at present com¬
pose the greater part of , the members ; but an increased
support from the medical, legal, and clerical professions,
is amongst the desiderata; and your Committee would
hail their membership as a tokenTor good.
Upon a review of the whole, the establishment of a
Phrenological Society in Sheffield must be regarded as a
great, and your Committee hesitate not to say, a success¬
ful experiment. Commencing, as it did, immediately
after the buffooneries of a quack,—in a town, too, where
Spurzheim had met with neglect,—aided by few in the
higher walks of life,—and in the midst of a deeply dis¬
tressed district,—its progress so far must afford ample
satisfaction to the most incredulous mind. The mem¬
bers, as a body, have, during the session, kept closely to
the Society’s leading principle—the evolution of facts by
induction. Eager after truth, they could not pass by
without notice topics not strictly within the domains of
a tentative philosophy: in every case, however, the atten¬
tion given had always a proportionate relation^ the im¬
portance of the subject.
With regard to the future prospects of the Society,
high hopes may be entertained. Success is said to be a
6
stimulus to exertion. Your Committee have succeeded
far beyond their incipient hopes, and an increased activity
will doubtless be the result. From the past, they gather
experience for the future, and that future will be just
what the industry, spirit, and talent of the members will
to make it.
Cheering as the public aspect of the Society may be,
your Committee feel convinced, that nothing will benefit
the members so much, as a rigid adherence to that course,
which originally laid the foundations of the science—
careful observation. From observation did the science
spring ; by observation hath it been carried on; and by
observation alone can it ever approximate perfection.
To a want of continuous observation, Mr. Geo. Combe,
in a lecture to the people of America, ascribes the downfal
of so many Societies.
Yopr Committee, therefore, in conclusion, say to every
member.
OBSERVE MUCH : RECORD OFTEN : GENERALISE LITTLE.
