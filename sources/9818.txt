The surgery consists of opening the gum line and exposing bone structure and grafting bone or a bone substitute. I had the same surgery on the left side ten years earlier under general anesthesia without complications. I have an abnormally low resting heart rate at 42-48 BPM and have been as low as 38 BPM.  Anesthesia lowers the heart rate even further. I informed the anesthesiologist about my condition. The anesthesia was fed into my arm via an IV catheter. Shortly after the start of the procedure, I felt my legs go numb and then I couldn't move them. The paralysis crept up my body and into my chest, which constricted. The paralysis then proceeded up in to my neck and throat; I stopped breathing and started to panic. I tried to yell out but could not utter a word. I felt that I was being nailed inside a coffin. My body stiffened, I relaxed, and left my body.  I could see myself outstretched and was floating above myself. 

Lucky, an alert dental technician saw my distress. The IV tubes were yanked out of my arm. I was resuscitated, came round and then passed out. The anesthesiologist met with my wife and verified that there was an incident that required resuscitation. 

After the incident, I became violently sick and remained that way for a couple of days. A feeling of detachment stayed with me for about 6 months. I felt as if I was in another dimension.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        Yes For a while after the experience I felt detached from relationships.  I view life now as being too short and unpredictable to be pressured by certain people or events. My relationship with my wife changed for the better.

Death is imminent and the experience I had was just a prelude.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     I still live the incident as a reality and as if it happened yesterday. Mine was not a pleasant experience and perhaps that is because I was not ready to go. There is hardly a week that goes by when I do not think about it.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No       

  	Experience Description 3682  					</p>  					I underwent twilight anesthesia procedure using Deprovera for oral surgery. I have a very low heart rate at 39-42 beats per minute. Too much or the wrong anesthesia will lower my heart rate even more and kill me. I warned the anesthesiologist about this condition. While he was busy giving instructions and watching the monitors rather than me, I had a reaction. Paralysis crept from my lower chest up through my esophagus, my throat, neck and my head. I started becoming distressed and suffered extreme shortness of breath. After a short period, I could no longer breathe. I tried to yell out, to scream but had no voice, no sound. It was like being in a coffin, buried and alive, with no one hearing me. I stopped breathing completely and could no longer move. I was at the point of straining trying to call out. Finally, an assistant heard a faint whisper come out of me ‘not breathing’. He still did not understand and the anesthesiologist was not paying attention. 

I then left my body and saw my physical body go limp. I was at the point of not returning. The technician who tried to catch my whisper saw what was happening. The anesthesia mask was ripped off my face, the IV was taken out and I was intubated. I came back in a panic, clawing and grabbing at everything. I was surprised how close I came and I immediately recalled being outside of my body watching myself go limp. The evening before the experience, I had a dream about two long dead friends who said ‘we are waiting for you’. I guess that they will have to wait a while longer. Up until two days ago, I had a strange feeling of being sad and melancholy.  

I am not a person who is greatly spiritual. I go to church, but I am a critical thinker. I am educated with two Masters Degrees. However, I know that something unusual happened and I definitely do not feel the same.

Did you have a feeling of joy?       incredible joy

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?     I felt united or one with the world

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control     I now feel that dying is mostly in stages, if not instant, like a heart attack or auto accident. I am just learning to cope with the experience as it has been less than 10 days since the incident. I have had feelings of remorse, sadness and melancholy since the incident. I keep thinking about it and cannot shake off the thought that it is going to repeat itself.

Did scenes from the future come to you?       Scenes from the world's future

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    No

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        Uncertain I feel different, which my wife commented on this evening. I told her that since the experience, I did not feel confident about my longevity and need to get things in order.  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       No

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Seeing my body going from paralysis to limp and being aware that it was happening. I felt myself giving up, surrendering. Upon revival, I was in a state of panic, gasping for air under an oxygen mask and grabbing everything around me.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    Within an hour of being revived I told my wife and her friend who drove me back home, a 2 hour trip.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     Yes   I had a dream the evening prior to the incident about two long dead friends, husband and wife, 'were waiting for me'. It probably heightened my anxiety going into the procedure.

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     I knew it happened and why and it was verifiable. I became exhausted. People told me days afterwards that I looked exhausted, tired and somewhere else. I remained in that state until two days ago (7-8 days).

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     See above comments. It was medically verifiable.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       This was real. I was at the stage of going limp and giving up. I constantly think about it.    

  	Experience Description 4850  					</p>  					I was given an anesthetic agent for a surgical procedure, to which I had a violent reaction. This was the same agent that killed Mich'l Jackson, Diprivan or Propofol. My heart rate when resting is very low and I could feel it drop lower, much lower. I became paralyzed up to my throat. I could not move nor speak. I felt that I was being nailed inside a coffin, alive. I stiffened up and stopped breathing. I was whispering, barely audibly, trying to alert someone to the fact that I could not breathe. 

Then I relaxed, felt like I was floating and left my body. I could see myself lying back in the surgical chair. A technician who saw my distress ripped off the anesthesia mask and I was resuscitated. I fought before relaxing and at the relaxation stage, I was giving up. At that point, I saw myself from above. I became violently ill that night and all of the next day. Then I started feeling a void and things have never felt the same since. At times, it feels like I am on a different plane of existence. 

The scary part is that I am due for another procedure on October 18th (in another week) and if this happens again, I feel it will be final. Right now I am getting things in order, just in case.

Were your senses more vivid than usual?       Incredibly more vivid

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.     My vision was slightly foggy but that could have been as a result of the anesthesia.

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.    There was no sound except from within me. I could hear myself screaming inside of myself. Sounds around me where more like whispers.

But up until that moment I just felt sheer panic.

Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?       Relief or calmness

Did you have a feeling of joy?       incredible joy

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?     I felt united or one with the world

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?       Everything about the universe

Did scenes from your past come back to you?       My past flashed before me, out of my control     It felt like I was on a different plane, like I experienced some void or detachment. I still feel this from time to time. Sometimes, I feel that the event was incomplete. For a while afterwards I did not care about surrounding things. I also feel that should this event occur again it will draw to an ultimate conclusion.

Did scenes from the future come to you?       Scenes from the world's future

Did you come to a border or point of no return?       I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will     

God, Spiritual and Religion:

What was your religion prior to your experience?    Liberal

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?       Uncertain     I am a liberal and have spiritual beliefs that I merge with scientific evidence. One would probably call that agnostic. As of late, I have been preparing myself, through adult confirmation classes, for confirmation into the church.

What is your religion now?       Liberal

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       Uncertain     I am a liberal and have spiritual beliefs that I merge with scientific evidence. One would probably call that agnostic. As of late, I have been preparing myself, through adult confirmation classes, for confirmation into the church.

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?       I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?       I actually saw them  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?    Yes   As described above, I felt on a different plane or in a different dimension after the event and still have some of that feeling.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?        Yes The feeling of detachment seems to distance me in my relationships.  

After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?       Yes     I felt I was on a different plane, in a different dimension and felt detached for a long time afterwards. I really did not care about my surroundings; I had a feeling of ambivalence. I still have those feelings. I work with animals and since the event, I have noticed and feel that the animals have a special affinity to me. I can walk through our medical center and the animals waiting there gravitate to me. I sometimes feel like a St. Francis with the animals, but of course not that saintly.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?        Leaving my body and the subsequent feeling of being on a different plane or in a void.

Have you ever shared this experience with others?     Yes    I have only shared the feeling of being on a different plane, a void and the feeling of detachment. People have noticed and remarked about the animals, but that may also be due to my nature in general.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?     No

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?       Experience was definitely real     I viewed the reality with a strange detachment. It was a unique experience.

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?       Experience was definitely real     It was real and the physiological response to the anesthesia was verified by the anesthesiologist and surgeon. I have done some research on the steps to death and feel that my experience replicates these other experiences as follows:   1) A life threatening event that shuts down body functioning.   2) An awareness of surroundings and the event taking place.   3) Panic, but being unable to do anything about it.   4) Paralysis and stiffening of muscle.   5) Relaxation.   6) Out of body with the ability to see oneself.

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?     No

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?       I am going back to Mexico within a week of writing this. I do not have a comfortable feeling about the procedure. I have the feeling that I need to get things in order.

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?       A little more on the aftermath, of life after a NDE.
