all their communication systems are
moving through the consciousness field
and are thought actuated the people of
the cia call it wsfm weird science and
freaking magic
the trans-dimensional interstellar
technology
will benefit humanity
that has been tremendous disinformation
the media is keeping secrets with the
government
these are lethal vicious people and i&#39;m
focused on exposing the extraordinary
technologies that they want to keep
secret
no aspect of life on earth will be
unaffected by
glad to be here
you know it&#39;s crazy times right now we
got a war going on and there&#39;s a lot of
cry in the public for you know the
energy crisis people are suffering out
there the perpetuals on the rise and
apparently
there is technology that could change
the world overnight and that&#39;s what we
got into in our latest documentary with
you above top secret so right what&#39;s
what&#39;s on the agenda dr stephen graham
is there any plans in the future that
could change things or is it gonna you
know go down a road that we&#39;re never
gonna be able to come back from
well it&#39;s a it&#39;s really up to a lot of
people right now but as you know i&#39;ve
been working this issue for 32 years and
you know the situation we&#39;re in now the
brink of nuclear war and
oil prices and shortages
uh very predictable because we&#39;ve stayed
in the game of fossil fuels for about a
hundred years longer than we needed to
and
we can prove this
and this uh this film above top secret
is a very important uh sort of
uh
overview let&#39;s call it uh what these
technologies are what&#39;s behind ufo uh
energy systems propulsion systems
and the most important question the
question that&#39;s always asked
of me when i brief someone in washington
is the all-important why
why is this being kept secret that was
the very first
question
from the director of the cia that i
briefed the first time because
he knew the subject was real he knew
that ufos existed
and had a sighting
but
the ci director didn&#39;t understand why
he and the president were being denied
access to these operations and projects
and why the extraordinary level of
illegal secrecy would be imposed so that
was really the crux of that conversation
and that&#39;s what this above top secret
film uh is is beginning to answer
uh we knew back when i first put
together the recommendations for clinton
back in the
ancient history before the public
knew the word disclosure project and
what have you that you know we would get
increasingly in a bad situation from the
point of view of the environment
geopolitics
and the instability of the world because
of our dependency on a handful of oil
kleptocracies and oligarchs and of
course here we are in 2022 and exactly
in that situation so
it&#39;s a really important matter
people think it&#39;s tangential to the
situation in the world with ukraine
russia other parts of the world it is
not the entire geopolitical order is
driven quite frankly
by uh this black curse of oil which if
that&#39;s the only energy system we could
use
will it be understandable if all there
was was oil and solar power and
windmills and there&#39;s not enough of the
latter two to run the planet right now
it would be understandable but that&#39;s
not the situation the situation is that
we absolutely have
um the solutions but they&#39;re in highly
classified beyond black above top secret
uh projects and and we can prove that
you know what&#39;s interesting uh dr sam
mcgregor is
you know when you&#39;re breaking down this
this whole idea of this technology being
hidden and there&#39;s so many walls being
built up and for you know our government
to break that wall and get into
basically call the black box where you
know everything could be fixed pretty
much overnight seems that this wall is
being
built so high it&#39;s almost impossible to
break down do we have strategy to break
down these walls to you know
maybe get access to these black budgets
we&#39;re gonna need help from the community
out there why
because
a little bit of history here
and i know that when for example
the so-called davis memo about
me briefing with edgar mitchell
astronaut mitchell
and some of my early military witnesses
of admiral wilson
at the pentagon when i spoke of it years
ago i don&#39;t think people quite believed
that the head of intelligence for the
joint chiefs of staff
would be denied access to projects which
should be under his purview and
oversight and control
but he was
and that davis memo proves it and in
fact it very clearly states that he was
threatened with demotion
and frankly worse
now that was a result of our initially
given the admiral very specific
actionable intelligence from documents
and facilities and
sub facilities uh such as s4 and other
places
lockheed skunk works locations uh
manufacturing of places for the
man-made ufos etc
and unfortunately
even though
you would think the guy putting together
the intelligence brief every day for the
joint chiefs of staff of the united
states
would have all access to something like
that he had no access
the same was the situation for the
director of the cia they briefed and the
president the same was true for
the three-star general who was head of
the defense intelligence agency
uh general patrick hughes who i spent a
great deal of time briefing
he was denied access and actually
ridiculed for even asking
even though i have witnesses in our
disclosure project
who worked in
super black
unacknowledged special access projects
on this issue
and were assigned to the dia defense
intelligence agency which is it&#39;s
basically the dia is essentially
uh like the cia for for military
intelligence as opposed to civilian
and the same is true for members of of
the senate intelligence committee i
briefed years ago uh the people who have
been chairman of the senate foreign
relations committee
uh
very senior folks in the house who were
on science and technology and government
oversight and on and on and on
so at a certain point by between 1993 or
92
and 1997
we had concluded
that
the people who the public and the media
portray as running the u.s government
they do on most
issues on this issue and some related
ones they do not
there&#39;s a transnational
not international group
that has enormous
technologies
way beyond what even people managing the
black budget of the united states would
know about or have access to
and so
and remember admiral wilson admitted he
had been involved in unacknowledged
special access projects
off the books deep black but nothing
that touched this issue and when he
tried to get inside
that box he was slapped down and pushed
away
while he was in that position these are
not retired people that i&#39;m talking
about having met with there i have met
with some retired people but the whole
time that for example the minister of
defense of canada hellyer that i uh
brought into this subject and people
like uh minister of defense lord hill
norton with whom i met in england who
was a five-star admiral a sea lord and
had been head of the ministry of defense
for the united kingdom uh the minister
of defense
uh for australia that i met with at a
secret meeting i guess you call it back
in 19 2013
and uh in australia none of these men
who you would think okay they&#39;re heads
of the biggest
some of the biggest military
operations in the world as their
secretaries of defense or ministers of
defense that they would have access and
have been read into or briefed no
none of them were not one and they were
not lying
so
this is
prima facie
in fact proof
of an illegal
unconstitutional corrupt enterprise
and that&#39;s why we tell people who have
been in these projects as say foot
soldiers technicians engineers tactical
operators
uh corporate or
intelligence or military
so if we were ever
going to move this forward it is
absolutely
right now
yeah absolutely you know what&#39;s crazy is
when we set out to make this film above
top secret we kind of reached out to
you know the people that we felt most to
be
on the inside you know james goodall
michael stratt de souza and yourself and
you&#39;re gracious enough to
get us over over there to virginia and
we met you in person that was
interesting because when we were
back
at base editing this film
i became very angry
just at the fact of how much has been
hidden from us and i expect a lot of
people when they watch above top secret
are going to be very angry of how deeply
suppressed we are in the present day and
that being said let&#39;s take a quick look
at an exclusive peek at above top secret
some years ago
i was invited to go to a underground
research facility in el paso on the
mexican american border and this is a
place where they were doing
these sort of technologies that are
trans-dimensional but medical
applications
major stuff technologies literally
electromagnetic transdimensional
technologies where they can if someone
had a missing limb
they can attach to the subtle body
the mystics called astral body but that
energy like you have phantom pain and
regrow it here&#39;s the issue the same
technology that gives you
that would give you
free energy to run your house because
it&#39;s in that same let&#39;s call it
constellation
of extraordinary technologies that they
want to keep secret so there are a lot
of
spin-offs beyond energy propulsion in
the environment
that will
benefit humanity once we can get the
first level of this out because it&#39;s
unbelievable how backward
even our medical technology is compared
to what&#39;s possible
so that&#39;s also a very bit of good news
this is why i&#39;ve called for
sort of a
marshall plan for the planet for new
energy in the environment that is
supported and funded by individuals
in an open source way and not expecting
i think it&#39;s you know silly to expect
the government of the united states or
any other government to get behind doing
something that brings out the most
disruptive technologies in the history
of the human race let&#39;s be blunt
but it&#39;s also creates a new civilization
and it saves our future
so if
this had been introduced slowly
from the early 20th century 100 years
ago
to now
we&#39;d be okay but now we&#39;ve run out of
time because what&#39;s happening to the
biosphere
geopolitically population boom so in
order to create
uh
you know enough change quickly enough
we&#39;re gonna have to do something very
different very
fundamentally different than what we&#39;ve
been doing
so there&#39;s a sneak peek of above top
secret and and we&#39;ve got dr stephen
grier with us and uh you know like i
said people
should you know basically get pissed off
after they watch this in regards to
this struggle that we&#39;re all trying to
get to disclosure now what i hope
above top secret will do
will stimulate
more of these whistleblowers and people
who have information to come forward
because when you learn
and honestly you know as an emergency
doctor i never thought i&#39;d be put in
this situation honestly
taking care of shootings and stabbings
and car wrecks
less traumatic than this
but i think that
it&#39;s something that has
reached the point
where there are enough people in
government
um you know after our documentary
unacknowledged came out four or five
years ago and it ended up having three
quarters of a billion
750 million people see it
things began to move until where there
were a lot of inquiries happening there
were some charlatans who surfaced who
then provided disinformation to these
folks
now they realize they&#39;ve been zoomed
they&#39;ve been uh gas lit
and they&#39;re reaching out to folks who
who can actually you know provide
accurate information and assessments so
that&#39;s what our job is has been
although i want to be very clear so the
conspiracy kooks out there don&#39;t go nuts
i don&#39;t work for anyone in the
government i&#39;m not paid by anyone the
government or corporation or anyone
international
or a covert program this is a completely
self-funded
effort the disclosure project has never
been part of
that system and nor am i even now as i
share this with you
now that&#39;s by design
because once you get pulled in that
system it&#39;s a slippery slope to end up
at the bottom of
you know
at the wrong end of
a deal where you&#39;ve lost your autonomy
and your ability to be free
which i guard more than anything
that&#39;s our freedom
you know and there&#39;s so many critics out
there as well in regards to what you&#39;ve
been doing all these years but let&#39;s
take another quick look at an exclusive
right here above top secret watch this
this is one the cautionary tale
when stan meyer&#39;s collection of
technologies were acquired by this other
entity and i
said whoever gets it tell them they have
to do it open source
in front of the whole world the whole
world&#39;s going to be watching this
technology being refined developed
beliefs
without any intellectual property pulled
back without patent
because otherwise they&#39;re not going to
survive their launch
i got this call a couple years later
who had ended up being the money behind
that acquisition and he says
these people are running for their lives
they are looking for an eco-friendly
country
that they can get to because they&#39;re
they&#39;re being threatened in america i
said you&#39;d have to go to another star
system
there&#39;s no plan place on this planet
where the the henchmen
of these kind of fourth reich
fascists won&#39;t find you and they didn&#39;t
want to let go of them the greed and
profit move they wanted to be the next
rockefellers of energy you see
so that is the achilles hill next thing
i know i meet with a guy in orange
county california who knew one of the
people who was with that engineering
team
and the man said this guy came in was
crying like a baby
because every single one of them had
been killed and the technology vanished
there&#39;s a difference there&#39;s a bit a sea
change here because for years people
in these governmental positions
weren&#39;t interested if they were
interested as i described in the last 30
years i&#39;ve been involved they would be
stood down threatened
uh blocked
now we have people who understand this
the situation
but who are responsible
for these areas or should be
and who have the means
to go the distance
so
that
is a very different situation and that&#39;s
why we need to have people who are
serious folks
you know a big network of folks out
there
like you&#39;re going to have on the show
tonight working the system and finding
people who want to come in through the
back door
i have been very blunt in my meetings in
the last few weeks in washington that
you are not i will tell these folks i&#39;m
going to get anything through the front
door through the chain of command
through asking nicely you&#39;re going to
have to find ways to go around that dam
you&#39;re going to have to be the water
that flows around those boulders and
blocks
and that&#39;s what we have to do and that&#39;s
the strategy that i&#39;ve been working for
you know almost 30 years
you know at the time that i first
started this i didn&#39;t think that&#39;s what
we&#39;d have to do i honestly thought
you know in in back in the day when i
thought there was an intact
constitution and chain of command
i could provide enough specific
information to the chief executive the
president and his folks
they can make inquiries the doors would
open for them and they would do the
right thing well
ending bring the appropriate information
out on this well that didn&#39;t happen
because the doors never opened they were
blocked at every turn
and so and remember even when uh
john podesta left the
the
obama administration to run hillary
clinton&#39;s campaign he tweeted out my
biggest disappointment all these years
in government is not having been able to
to effect disclosure on the ufo issue
and he had been chief of staff for
clinton back in the day when you know we
were doing a lot of this
and and then subsequently put together
obama&#39;s cabinet then ran hillary&#39;s
campaign and on and on and on
and you know he never got read into this
and never got access even though we
provided a lot of information to people
like him and his corollary in the bush
administration you know andy card chief
of staff we gave an entire huge briefing
document
handed to him in person by one of our
whistleblowers military witnesses
and that didn&#39;t get him in the door
either
because the guy running that shop was
dick cheney who was blocking
and deceiving president bush and we know
this
so you know this is
a complicated it&#39;s very complicated
unfortunately
and people don&#39;t like nuanced and
complicated stories they want simplistic
conspiracy theories and rubbish
i don&#39;t have the luxury of living in
that fantasy world off the internet
neither should you anymore or anyone
else on this team but i think that we
have to
uh realize what the lay of the land is
you have to deal with the
the the
the hand that you&#39;ve been dealt
and
whether it&#39;s us the public
we&#39;re in the same boat
really as these leaders in our country
and the only ones who are in that system
and right into them are people who are
part and know they&#39;re part of a corrupt
enterprise at least the leadership now
where where the sweet spot is let me be
clear
or not necessarily the leadership of
this group the majority intelligence
committee as it&#39;s been called
magic
it&#39;s the folks who&#39;ve been on retrieval
teams
and there it&#39;s folks who&#39;ve been out in
the field or have worked in the skunk
works underground or who have been
in s4 who have been at dugway up in utah
uh who have been in various corporations
and booz allen hamilton and and lockheed
skunk works in northrop grumman and
others
these folks who have worked this task
know a lot and there are thousands of
them and they&#39;re afraid
and i understand their fear
um but
now we have an opportunity to do
something about it above top secret i
think
uh i hope
will stimulate a debate but also will
tease
bring out of that system
another whole this generation
of disclosure
related whistleblowers and if they can
be come into our system
we now have a place for them to
direct their information that can result
in change and that&#39;s you know what i&#39;m
doing this for i&#39;m not doing this for
muckraking
or gossip i&#39;m doing this to affect an
enormous change because the implications
of the change are you can&#39;t even begin
to calculate
imagine having technologies
that would at once
solve all the environmental problems
most medical problems
end dependency on oil change
geopolitical
dynamic that&#39;s leading to all these
problems all over the world
and would give
all people in the world the ability to
live in an abundant prosperous way with
quote-unquote free so-called zero point
quantum vacuum energy uh
systems which are touched on in this
film above top secret
it&#39;s an entirely new world
uh and and it&#39;s one that&#39;s been poor
stalled
and been prevented from evolving for
over 100 years so this is what i call is
the whole lost century
of social
and technological uh evolution and with
it i suspect a spiritual evolution of
our species because people are still
grubbing around trying to eke out a
subsistence living three billion people
on the planet by the way
still get their ability to cook their
food by chopping down trees making
charcoal and burning wood which is
what&#39;s happening to all the old growth
forests a lot of it three billion with a
bee
almost half the population of the world
so
we can do better than this but we&#39;re not
going to do better than this with the
zero-sum game of fossil fuels or
the low den energy output and very
expensive energy output of just wind and
solar these new technologies that are
truly space-age and amazing that will
give us the world of our dreams and and
will help
create a new civilization for our
children and and my 11 grandchildren
i know yeah absolutely
you&#39;re pretty busy with the
grandchildren as of recent time but you
know let&#39;s get back and we&#39;re going to
be uh
let&#39;s tell everybody we have an entire
guest panel uh sitting in the background
and they&#39;re going to be joining us in
just a few moments we&#39;ve got michael
schratt
military aerospace historian along with
james c goodall also a historian
aviation expert and
john de souza retired fbi agent known as
the x-men with all kinds of insight he&#39;s
also an author but we&#39;re gonna get this
discussion going here in just a moment
but let&#39;s get into this thing behind me
right here the tic tac you know it&#39;s on
the above top secret poster some people
are
you know from some of the sources we&#39;re
hearing and i&#39;m sure
there&#39;s a rumbling going on and i i just
wanted to ask you without giving up too
much without um you know getting in
trouble but
is there
it seems to me that our government has
created this false narrative of the
threat and
what&#39;s really going on is the private
corporation has developed this
technology and maybe this private entity
this private company is getting
too powerful even more powerful than our
own government&#39;s assets and
this is kind of a dangerous game if we
have a private entity that could run
circles
around our jet fighters with technology
that&#39;s owned by a private citizen
possibly in our country it&#39;s neither
government as you and i think of it nor
a private corporate it&#39;s a hybrid of the
two
it&#39;s a complete commingling
of what eisenhower called the military
industrial meaning corporate
uh complex
that is the truth
eisenhower knew what he was talking
about absolutely
and he was betrayed by those interests
now
we have
the same situation now there&#39;s not much
that&#39;s changed since eisenhower gave
that speech in january of 1961 as he was
leaving office of the president
after eight years
unfortunately i would like to say it has
but
it has only gotten worse in the sense
that the consolidation of power center
of gravity
has devolved out of legal constitutional
oversight
into this hybrid entity that is part
governmental but beyond black
beyond top secret and highly centered in
corporate interests
now if you study the history of fascism
the classical definition of fascism
is the corporate takeover or corruption
and influence of government to the
benefit
of the corporate entities and private
financial and other entities that is
what the definition of fascism is as it
evolved in the 1800s and early
1900s which then led eventually to the
buffoonery and tragedy of mussolini and
hitler and others but that&#39;s the
definition so we&#39;re really talking about
a continuation of that
proclivity
for uh the both corrupt interests and
government and corporations
working together but it&#39;s reached such a
point of power
that it greatly exceeds the power of
what you just called the government of
the united states
so i think people have to be i mean
again this is
um it&#39;s shocking it&#39;s disturbing it
happens to be the truth
the the you know i know that this is
through the looking glass here
that a retired emergency doctor
working this system for 30 years
would have and the people i&#39;m working
with who are substantial
sources of intelligence on this subject
who come forward that we become the de
facto source of information for people
that should be able to hit a button and
pick up the phone and get all this
information
so
it&#39;s bizarre
but it&#39;s the truth and unfortunately
i&#39;ve tried i&#39;ve explained this to the
public since the 90s i don&#39;t think
people have believed it
um i really don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass if
people believe it or not this is the
truth
um and eventually people come around and
realize this is the truth but i don&#39;t
think that that&#39;s it can be my concern
i&#39;m not interested in salacious gossips
and you know i&#39;m not running for the
mayor of crazytown ufology we really
have a very important
role project here that that that has to
you know continue the disclosure project
just was the
uh project that we named uh after
project starlight we get into the
clinton library which was the initial
effort
uh by people that i was working with
back in the early and mid 90s
to provide information to to congress
and to
the president hoping they would do
something
but they weren&#39;t ready um and now
they&#39;re ready
and i think that
uh
it&#39;s this is a very good opportunity
it&#39;s a big potential breakthrough but
there&#39;s one hell of a lot of work to do
we&#39;re going to need everyone&#39;s help i
want to be very blunt i mean this is you
know i don&#39;t have the at my disposal a
billion dollar
budget and and and armies of people to
do this this is something that&#39;s being
done
um
with like some of the folks you just
named it will be joining me in a moment
uh out of their
goodness of their hearts and their
devotion to
uh the truth and to making a big change
happen that could
really
fix most of the huge problems facing
humanity
absolutely and uh we got the major
players in the documentary above top
secret but speaking of that let&#39;s take a
look look at the trailer and then
get to the panel members of this
incredible documentary let&#39;s roll the
trailer right now
if the crash retrievals are true
then all bets are off
it&#39;s very hard for people to get their
minds around where the real power is
and it&#39;s not at 1600 pennsylvania avenue
the reality is something much more stark
they&#39;ve been working on this for 60 70
perhaps 80 years
the reason why the government is talking
about these ufos now
are getting ready for the next level of
war are these objects a national
security concern
they&#39;re proffering a narrative of a
national security threat that doesn&#39;t
exist
i call them alien reproduction vehicles
they are made by private corporations
somewhere on this planet technology from
roswell from 1947
has largely been held back from us
portal technology teleportation whatever
you can imagine it&#39;s already been done
the biggest secrets are not the zero
point energy and electrogravitics it&#39;s
the science of consciousness all their
communication systems are moving through
the consciousness field and are thought
actuated the people the cia call it wsfm
weird science and freaking magic
the transdimensional interstellar
technology
will benefit humanity
that has been tremendous disinformation
the media is keeping secrets with the
government
these are lethal vicious people and i&#39;m
focused on exposing the extraordinary
technologies that they want to keep
secret
no aspect of life on earth will be
unaffected by it
then let&#39;s bring in uh the incredible uh
cast of this
documentary right now with michael
schratt we got john de souza the x-men
and we&#39;re going to be bringing uh jim
goodall in just a moment but
before we get to jim michael john
d&#39;souza um
dr greer is here you guys
appreciate you guys joining us i know
john i think it&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve
uh met dr grier so yes it&#39;s great dr
greer to finally meet you thank you good
to meet you too
it is a great great privilege and honor
for me
uh seeing as how my work over the years
has intersected with your own
on so many different occasions and it&#39;s
been a real it&#39;s a real pleasure and an
honor and
i&#39;m really uh happy to welcome you also
to uh to arizona for your big event that
is uh going on april 8th 9th and 10th
right scottsdale arizona the ce5 uh that
is going to be going on there that&#39;s
going to be really amazing event i&#39;m
really looking forward to yeah and if
folks can&#39;t be there in person you can
webinar it for the whole weekend and
it&#39;ll be a great a lot of fun
and uh all those dates
and 10th inclusive all the way through
sunday night
we&#39;ll be out on the native american land
that
it&#39;s very sacred doing what we&#39;re doing
which is more the citizens diplomacy
effort end of what we do with ce5
contact
and actually i&#39;ll be talking about this
film during that uh whole conference
and uh that&#39;ll be awesome
yeah it&#39;s a powerhouse of a film and uh
you know getting all your guys uh
participation was uh something that was
kind of a dream come true you know we&#39;re
asking big questions but when when we
give you these questions you guys give
us so much information and that&#39;s what&#39;s
uh incredible that we&#39;re finding answers
to our questions and and then again the
frustration we could feel fill it with
all you uh gentlemen that this fight&#39;s
been going on for a long time and you
guys been uh veterans in this field and
that&#39;s the major appreciation right here
michael schratt with his new uh youtube
channel blue room media top-notch
investigative reporting on the history
of ufos and appreciate you michael for
joining us tonight it&#39;s good to be with
all of you absolutely absolutely michael
michael is michael stratt is an
indispensable
resource and
source of great insight information
specific
details
that actually are more important than i
think michael realizes
significantly more important
and i think that people who&#39;ve lived
working on this toilet in this field for
so long
greatly overestimate
the people who are in the system
not in the the above top secret world
but in the normal system
what they have access to what they know
um and so i think we have to also go
forward with a sense of compassion that
you know we need to put together and
organize
the information that&#39;s very
solid that&#39;s not speculative
in a form
and in a way that they can
understand
and then also put it up through the
chain of command
and it can be digested because this is
you all know this would work this is
drinking from a fire hose
yeah
you know what uh you know let&#39;s i don&#39;t
want to be the host in this show i just
kind of want to throw it around in a
conversation but let&#39;s uh let&#39;s start it
off with these documents that were
recently uh
dropped as of you know the congress
had their
um top secret documents they released
the nothing burger a few months ago and
we only got a few pages and it was
really nothing to it but now there&#39;s new
paperwork that&#39;s been out via john
greenwald and we went over it recently
but the problem is 90
or you know 85 percent of the documents
maybe 95
it&#39;s just totally redacted uh
information what
i know they&#39;re afraid of some of the
technology behind
retrieving or
well i&#39;m going to say it here i&#39;ve
received some information in regards to
the redacted paperwork i have a source
apparently who&#39;s
seeing the non-redacted portion and we
only got a little bit of detail but
apparently there&#39;s a photograph or some
film of a satellite has that has
captured an unidentified flying object
but the problem is they don&#39;t want to
release it because of the technology
that it was taken with the optics and
they say if they release this photograph
it&#39;s going to jeopardize national
security but that&#39;s the first concern
the second one which they say more
importantly is that the
this image
is so provocative that it would change
maybe our consciousness as a
civilization
that we can&#39;t handle it so
john what&#39;s your thoughts on that dee
they obviously the government has
footage film of these craft
why are they so vague with these videos
and is it really in your opinion
that we can&#39;t handle it as a
human race
well you know i was just watching
on a previous uh speech of dr greer
where he actually uh predicted perfectly
what would happen with the june report
that was from the dni
and he actually just
went over
what what he just said in an
encapsulation where he said
people
recognize that dni
director of national intelligence well
his his clearance must be so high it
must be so universal that he can see
everything everything that we cannot see
and nothing could be further from the
truth nothing could be further from the
truth because whether you&#39;re talking
about the senate committee on national
security or whatever
or you&#39;re talking about the dni these
are compartmentalized programs that are
in their own in their own scope and
protected and there is
and as we saw the final report from the
dni uh that went over to the senate
committee and to many other places
uh ended up really not having anything
in it of any value
and so and we find that in many parts of
government where they pretend to have
these uh these incredible clearances
speaking of above top secret uh the
movie um they they just don&#39;t they don&#39;t
have the access the special access
programs that uh they pretend to have uh
because as we know these are programs
that uh the congressmen the senators
even the president himself
can try to walk into and they will be
locked out they will be locked out of
these things and a little insight on
that in terms of
again i&#39;m always trying to humanize
people get demonized because
people don&#39;t appreciate what it&#39;s like
to walk in their shoes
so let me talk about walking in the
shoes of some some of these folks
and i&#39;ll just this is
an example
when you&#39;re say the director of the cia
and you make inquiries in your denied
access and you know you&#39;re being denied
access to things that you
found some sources telling you that
exist
no public official
no dni no president no senator wants to
get up in front of the public and say
you know
well the emperor has no clothes
the constitution&#39;s been eviscerated
i don&#39;t have access to things that are
of this importance
it would diminish the office of the
president it would diminish
the
institution of the congress
and so i&#39;ve had these conversations and
that&#39;s why it&#39;s so terrifying
and so it&#39;s not that they&#39;re being
duplicitous
it&#39;s that they&#39;re um
afraid of the consequences
not the people not with what what you&#39;re
referring to blake the people are going
to go crazy in the streets because we&#39;re
not alone in the universe the majority
of americans already
believe we&#39;re being visited and that
we&#39;re not alone in the universe
i think it&#39;s more of these sort of
issues because that is terrifying what i
just said and i think that you you put
yourself in the shoes of one of these
people and you find out that there&#39;s a
lead a titanium ceiling
that you can&#39;t move through even though
you thought you were managing the black
budget of the united states even though
you were the oversight even though
you&#39;re in this executive position in
either the executive branch with the
president the director of national
intelligence or what have you
that&#39;s not something anyone wants to
talk about
for reasons that are quite obvious and
understandable on the other hand
um
you know the the
look i i talked to people who were in
they&#39;ve been in the skiff and saw what
was presented that blake&#39;s just referred
to
the method
the things that end up getting redacted
often are methods sources things like
you&#39;re referring to they don&#39;t want to
tip their hand to an adversary what our
actual
imaging capabilities are on the nro
satellites or what have you and that&#39;s
completely understandable
most of those things that are reducted
aren&#39;t substantive in what people think
are there
it&#39;s not like
because it&#39;s not like there&#39;s some
mother load of information on the e.t
issue or even on the so-called alien
reproduction vehicles the aerospace end
of engineering
that michael can speak to so expertly
that&#39;s not you know that&#39;s usually not
what&#39;s being redacted at all but just
people on the outside looking at it it
looks fishy
it&#39;s more of these other issues yeah it
looks guilty as hell with all the wasted
black ink they&#39;re doing with these
redacted papers
but again think about this when i&#39;ve uh
worked with these folks
you know
they have shared with me what was in
what&#39;s in those
so i think that we have to understand
that this is a
infinitely more screwed up unfortunately
i hate to say that in terms of
governmental
procedures oversight
and dare i say
the operation of the rule of law
on this than people think
and but it can be fixed what we&#39;re
trying to do now the initiative we have
now is to fix it
but it&#39;s going to take some quite wise
and calm cool heads to do it
if i&#39;ve seen a discussion panel crew
right here this is uh
pretty much the top of the line right
now we&#39;ve got jim goodall who&#39;s just
joined us hey jim
how&#39;s it going
michael john
dr greer
cousin brothers
with
i mean
you have the brain trust right here
right
that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying like wow it&#39;s
great to have everybody all in here uh
brett&#39;s here with me as well and he&#39;s
probably gonna get some questions in in
just a second but while what an
accomplishment uh everybody that we were
able to get this documentary out we were
able to um get it in a way to
i think the public is going to be amazed
by what they see and the knowledge
they&#39;re going to get but working with
all of you was just a again just it was
so liquid and the way it just flowed and
information and how we put it together
my brother and i and editing is just
is satisfying but it&#39;s frustrating as
well just because of again this
technology that&#39;s being hitted hey jim
we&#39;re just getting into the discussion
in regards to
basically can the public handle it you
know there&#39;s been so much
information these hollywood movies have
been making these extra thresholds look
like the the evil ones you know maybe
e.t was the only
safe movie out there as far as dealing
with e.t maybe they should make more et
movies i&#39;m not sure but
you know
if you ask me if our government showed
us a photograph of some extraterrestrial
craft that looked pretty insane
and said we&#39;re not alone
straight up and the public would know
there would be some
anxiety behind it like hmm what what is
their agenda being so brainwashed
watching all these horror movies with
extraterrestrials jim would you be able
to handle it no matter what the craft
look like oh abs absolutely
even
i mean if if all of a sudden if i&#39;m
walking in the back of my you know out
behind my house at night and all of a
sudden one of these
uh
characters or creatures or et&#39;s were to
approach me and they&#39;re pretty bizarre
looking i don&#39;t know how i&#39;d react but
it in broad daylight
if i were to see if they were to land
one at tucson
international or davis-monthan and i was
invited i would be thrilled i mean but
there are there are people there are
people who cannot deal with the even the
thought
of
we&#39;re not alone
and i and i honestly believe if they
were hostile
you and i
the the five of us would not be having
this discussion right now because we&#39;d
be under their under their heel from of
their big you know
nod nail boot
telling us what we&#39;re going to do how
we&#39;re going to think what we&#39;re going to
eat
and if you don&#39;t you didn&#39;t like it
we&#39;re going to feed you to the wolves so
no i i have i have no fear
from e.t
and again
if if in fact uh
if they were hostile we would we&#39;d have
known this a long time ago i mean there
wouldn&#39;t there wouldn&#39;t have been there
wouldn&#39;t been a civil war there wouldn&#39;t
been a revolutionary war there wouldn&#39;t
have been world war one world war ii
vietnam korea
and what you know you know the insanity
is going on right now right
well no i i i 100 agree and i think that
the the fear factor that&#39;s been pushed
out there
is a way of people being shut down
because fear shuts down the mind it
shuts down the spirit it fear overrides
rational thought
and uh it&#39;s a very clever thing to use
and demagogues and tyrants throughout
history
have
used that tactic and i think they&#39;ve
used it very well
and i see very well in a negative way on
this subject on the on the public
through the movies and what have you
um and when we released cosmic hopes on
july 4th of 2021
uh our purpose in that was to expose in
fact i just interviewed a man today who
was working in a uh
very compartmented operation with this
issue
who um
was personal witness
to a man-made
sort of triangular truncated cutoff off
one end triangular
electrogravitic
electric electromagnetic field
propulsion craft
that then released three greys
that proceeded to try to abduct him the
very important case and he knew that the
craft and these creatures were man-made
and they were all moving in unison and
rather robotically i said oh yeah i know
physicists who worked on on
developing those creatures and these are
the ones that are always on the cover of
books and
movies and movie posters that look like
the classic stereotypical alien
in point of fact that&#39;s a
counterintelligence operation and we
know it and we&#39;re providing that detail
of information to the people in the
government who are looking into this
because they don&#39;t know what to make of
it um and i think that
that&#39;s part of
well it began in the early 50s
the so-called psychological warfare
effort on this on this matter and it
went from sort of a clumsy stagecraft
using early
man-made aircraft that look like ufos
and
guys that were short or had some kind of
appearance
that could then be augmented with you
know stagecraft and makeup
uh
to scare people thinking they were alien
so now these very advanced kind of
robotic
nano bio machines
uh we don&#39;t have time to go into that
that you know the number of people i
work with who&#39;ve been in those
uh programs only tactically using them
on innocent civilians but have also been
in in places where they built them
and made them so this is one of the
problems with the whole ufo subculture
and the public
is that it&#39;s you know nine parts and ten
stage craft created by counter
intelligence operations
and we have to separate the wheat from
the chaff on all that
you know michael uh michael shreds the
investigator here uh in regards to the
historical evidence dates back uh over
100 years and these eyewitnesses have a
lot of things in common where some of
these craft
that have been historically documented
seem to be
man-made rivets bolts electrical systems
we have pipings coolant systems
underneath the craft what&#39;s your
thoughts on on what grid just said and
kind of the discussion overall but again
this man-made element people
you know have been misled by the major
media that it&#39;s threat we don&#39;t know
what they are we don&#39;t know we can&#39;t
possibly do these kind of uh maneuvers
or this technologies out of our hands
but then again there&#39;s these reports
that go back
decades
of these craft that c-man made what&#39;s
your thoughts on it is it something that
we maybe have
you know figured it out
uh well the the situation is as follows
and it&#39;s reached a point now where it&#39;s
seamless
and
anything short of the physical evidence
pertaining to the crash retrievals and
we&#39;re just spinning our wheels
we can no longer afford
these
ce1 cases where it&#39;s a light in the sky
we really need to progress forward
with the crash retrieval evidence and
that&#39;s what&#39;s going to move this field
forward anything less than that we&#39;re
just spinning our wheels and i&#39;ll give
you an example
we still can&#39;t even get the
1957 gordon cooper edwards air force
base film released after all this time
and here we&#39;ve got the defense
department drip dripping these documents
over decades of time we just don&#39;t have
time for this we really need to get down
to business so
time is of the essence yeah right and
that&#39;s why we need specific actual
intelligence right and people who&#39;ve
been on the inside to give these
investigators and folks i&#39;m working with
the precision with what what is for
example and i don&#39;t want to mention the
gentleman&#39;s name but there was a man who
from 2002 to 2012 was in the
technology management office in the
pentagon sub-basement
and you know he was in charge of uh
an investigation i won&#39;t go into the
details here uh but this is being handed
off to these folks and
the government that i&#39;ve been
meeting with
and
out at uh fort sill
and
near lawton oklahoma
he was escorted into and can name and
put the people exactly in the location
of where one of these retrieved
extraterrestrial vehicles are
is located it&#39;s located
and what they were working on and
studying at that particular site for
that particular vehicle
that is what i&#39;m talking about so i want
to give that as a specific example this
is fairly new
intelligence and
i think that we need to all
open up our networks and have folks come
forward
who can provide exactly what you michael
are referring to now i&#39;m not saying that
anyone
you know that we&#39;re not going to go in
and sort of invade that dumb that deep
underground military base uh or and
skiff the other thing
is that because these projects have been
declared unconstitutional on illegal
and we can prove they are
absolutely can prove it
at this point
i mean there&#39;s a parade of folks
from
that i met with from 92 forward
who absolutely should have had a need to
know and had a constitutional right to
be read into these projects
you know again what you guys are
offering to the public via this
documentary above top secret is um
priceless uh let&#39;s take a a quick look
at another uh sneak peek right here
exclusive of above top secret take a
look at this
most people think that the us government
builds stuff they contract it&#39;s called
wfo work for others and in 1993 i was at
the wrigley mansion in phoenix they
wanted me to come to a meeting very late
at night he says look
if you want to deal with the this issue
of these technologies the ufo issue
you don&#39;t need to talk to the president
the cia
director they don&#39;t know anything and
they&#39;re not going to know anything you
should be talking to people like us
we&#39;re the ones who are running the wfo
we&#39;re tied into certain i&#39;m quoting
orders of jesuit priests that are
working on the technology transfer we
have the super computers that bake back
up the banking system
and where we can get a lot of money just
from transactions where they&#39;re odd
amounts this sort of hybrid entity
partially
covert unacknowledged government
programs but a big part of that has been
outsourced
to big corporations covert contractors
and and other organizations so that&#39;s
kind of what developed in the post-world
war ii era and it still is how this is
how the operation runs
john de souza comes in and let me tell
you he brings the heat on and he&#39;s
calling out the major media on the lies
being spread
in regards to the disinformation and you
know the five the horsemen speaking
it&#39;s obvious that there&#39;s these actors
that are being put forward into the
major media apparently right now you
don&#39;t see them anymore in the major
media for some reason
we released the cosmic folks they took
the thunder and got taken out of their
sales yeah
there you go and the major media doesn&#39;t
want to touch them now they&#39;re going to
the bottom gutter of youtube and talking
to these youtube channels with the least
amount of subscribers and getting their
airplay there and creating these false
sense uh false rumors out there saying
that dr grier&#39;s paying all these
youtubers off and we&#39;re all under dr
grier&#39;s payroll
and uh
the paranoia behind this is almost
embarrassing but
then john de souza basically does the
same thing and above top secret and
there&#39;s this point in there where it
just ratches it up to a level and it
people should start to wake up that you
know some of these people that we were
holding on a pedestal
has been you know kicked out from
underneath them and now they&#39;re just
kind of gutter feeding on the bottom
feeders on on in youtube here it&#39;s it&#39;s
quite entertaining john what do you
think why are these guys obviously
cosmic coats destroyed the credibility
of some of these people but is
is the media ever gonna shape up on this
and get kind of maybe some of the
public&#39;s point of view versus just these
actors that are
you know put forward on the pedestal you
know these are pretty typical um
cia shop tactics that they are employing
uh
we have uh many uh actors uh like uh
like alessando who is who i believe is a
cia contractor and he is he&#39;s out there
but
we are still in the in the first we are
still in the phases of what i have heard
referred to as
operation fail-safe it&#39;s just a general
term that&#39;s used by people in national
security uh for these things i deal in
ideal in
uh it&#39;s
it&#39;s rough to say it but i deal with
rumors from the national security uh
branches so that they are not breaking
their security their their secrecy o&#39;s
when they talk to each other and they
talk to me uh these are these are rumors
these are raw data and it&#39;s because
we&#39;re not we&#39;re not violating any secret
cos by talking about these it&#39;s just raw
information and anyone who has worked in
national security knows that there are
times when a simple rumor can save your
life well we&#39;re in that situation here
because
uh we have we&#39;re in the phases the first
phases of operation fail-safe uh the
final operation for the cabal to
try to strike back
at this and our civilization
and it&#39;s the it&#39;s the it&#39;s the operation
that was predicted by verner von braun
of course and by and by others as well
and the first phase we&#39;re still in the
first phase of this operation which is
the acquiring of media political and
valuable assets
to work with them and there&#39;s a long
line of politicians of media of um of
even alternative
media
figures who we used to trust who are
online to become part of this operation
and it&#39;s and it&#39;s horrible it&#39;s
disgusting because they are people who
used to be trusted
and now they are working for the
darkness as we as we lurch our way
forward towards uh what i have called
fake alien invasion
that will be this
uh because the dark pentagon what i call
i call them the dark pentagon
us pentagon they are elements of the
pentagon that actually have these these
tic tacs these well i
refer to them as tic tacs uh these uh
vehicles that have possibly have some
anti-gravity
uh qualities to them uh that have been
reverse engineered and otherwise but
they are in the possession of the u.s
military well the uh the dark parts of
the u.s military i&#39;ll put it that way
and they are going they are looking to
use them and now we&#39;re going into this
we&#39;re going into a more advanced phase
uh like michael shrap was talking about
i believe that we are now going into a
period where these tic tacs are going to
have more aggressive
uh encounters with vehicles with
vehicles and people all over the world
all over the world and that&#39;s gonna
we&#39;re in that phase right now because
they need to ratchet up the fear because
they need to push it up and it&#39;s coming
uh like a few months ago we had one of
the tic tacs was in a cylinder shape and
actually sailed across the front of an
airliner
the airliner pilot called it out
it just came right back yeah jim goodall
broke that news yeah yeah
that was uh we broke that news on third
phase of moon thanks to jim goodall with
his uh contact with the uh ham radio
operator that picked that communication
up with the american airlines pilot and
we broke it up on we broke that on third
phase moon that same day and it took
five days for the major media to
actually break that story and we were
trying to share it to all the major
media saying hey we had the here&#39;s the
recording this is how we obtained it and
they didn&#39;t want to touch it and then
the fbi for some reason got involved
with it and we reached out to the fbi
and said hey look we
you know we were uh
we&#39;re the ones that broke this story we
have a contact who&#39;s the actual ham
operator let&#39;s help let&#39;s find out what
this is and then the next day we
received an inside document from what
was it
southwest airlines
of
of this warning to all the pilots that
something was going to happen that day
and if you see anything unusual report
it to tower and of course it was some
some kind of secret secret program but
they&#39;re not telling us what they&#39;re
exactly doing but they&#39;re giving people
the heads up that hey look something
might happen and if you pick up on this
report to tower and it&#39;s weird how the
communication was broken down in that
recording but that&#39;s a whole different
story jim um you know that was an
incredible uh breaking news that we uh
collaborated with when he woke up we
woke up that morning he had that audio
to us we&#39;re like man this is this is big
and it was just a chance encounter that
doesn&#39;t
everybody was able to you know to uh
record it
right i mean it blew him away is when he
you know when he i mean he immediately
called me and said guess what i have and
then you know within about
20 minutes uh it was off to uh
the brothers
so i figured
if somebody could give me that tape it&#39;d
be useful
don&#39;t assume that the folks that you
think
are supervising
the government on these sort of issues
know any of the things you&#39;re talking
about michael&#39;s saying
with your situation i mean i think
michael you could speak to how long
your historically have gone back that
there have been what would be called
man-made ufos operational that people
have seen yeah we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got the
historical archives
uh from
i would say at least five different
centers around the country and
what we kind of spoke about before is
they&#39;re all coming up with these same
patterns the tubes the pipes the
cylinders the low frequency electrical
humming noises
the the buzzing sounds like a
transformer or a sewing machine
testing on certain days uh color
patterns on the lights that are
inconsistent with an et craft it&#39;s just
showing you that there&#39;s a man-made
component to this and it&#39;s seamless it&#39;s
seamless at this point well then you&#39;ve
talked about the so-called alien
reproduction vehicle that mark mcanlis
at the disclosure project showed and
that brett sorensen had seen at the
norton air force space air show that
frank carlucci secretary of defense for
reagan was there
that those components were from the
mercury era gordon cooper&#39;s era
what&#39;s crazy too is that the you know
the people that are you know i guess lou
said it and there&#39;s people that are
saying that
we wouldn&#39;t destroy any evidence and
just throw it away prior to 2004. they
only want to deal with 2004 and up and i
guess that&#39;s part of these um briefs to
the congress that they don&#39;t even want
to touch anything prior to 2004 and
that&#39;s well that&#39;s not going to happen
anymore that&#39;s old history my friend uh
trust me on that
i do want to comment however on this
this issue about the so-called tic tac
and other
i i don&#39;t know jim that those are
necessarily um
accidental one of the things that has
happened and of course this is how you
create the specter of a threat
again you know the whole threat
assessment
what&#39;s been in the media and what&#39;s been
proffered to people in the senate and
elsewhere
because of these objects quote unquote
uh invading or impinging on classified
airspace or near
aircraft that are either civilian or
military
those craft that are man-made have done
so deliberately
because they want to trigger
a threat matrix in other words they want
to be able to say see how dangerous
these objects are
to
safety of the air or they&#39;re in a
classified area and they&#39;re not ours
and
i know from talking with folks in
washington there have been people who&#39;ve
gone up
on capitol hill and at the pentagon and
elsewhere and
in the white house who have flat out
said we
you know as humans don&#39;t have anything
that can move and fly like that or look
like that
and and that means that they&#39;re saying
that uh
off-world otherworldly quote-unquote
alien
objects have been in classified airspace
threatening
our operations or even civilian like
this american airlines situation
aircraft when in reality those have been
man-made
deep black
unacknowledged special access projects
above top secret whatever you want to
call them
that were done not accidentally usually
uh some have been accidents like the
cash landrum event that was a mishap
um but that was ours by the way
and uh
but
mostly those have been done when they&#39;ve
gone deliberately broad daylight or at
night into classified airspace
because the people who are
the pilots for a jet
or an air traffic controller
or name whatever person in the
conventional military in intelligence
they haven&#39;t been read in
to what these objects are therefore
they&#39;re completely convinced it cannot
be ours
and that is dangerous because
that has been played all that that
trial balloon has been sent all through
the media all the way up to the white
house and all the way up to the top
senate oversight committees
uh and it&#39;s it&#39;s a ruse it&#39;s a deception
and i think this is very dangerous
because to what end that&#39;s exactly
what
uh mr de souza was talking about that&#39;s
that this is to an end of creating the
specter of a threat
uh which doesn&#39;t exist but which would
be very convincing and they&#39;re
ratcheting up that threat matrix
and that&#39;s why these events have
happened and have happened historically
because they can be very convincing
and to people who
think that they know everything going on
at the lucky skunk works or northrop
grumman or at this air force base or
what have you
it&#39;s not within their world view
that this could possibly be human
when it is
and by the way the actual
extraterrestrial vehicles
they don&#39;t have bolts they don&#39;t have
washers they don&#39;t have
seams they don&#39;t have rivets
we know this
but unfortunately that kind of detail
which seems like that would be quite
obvious
isn&#39;t known by the people who everyone
thinks would know should know
and i think that&#39;s where there&#39;s this
big gap that we have to close
in the knowledge because you know
knowledge is power
and you know one one of the one of the
problems i&#39;ve run into because i was
doing a number of calls
i met most these most people that have
access to this stuff when i was young i
turned 77 tomorrow which means most of
the people that i have dealt with are
dead
birthday yeah
i just i was just uh i got a call an
email from
bill fox&#39;s daughter
foxy had almost 40 years of the skunk
works
and he&#39;s one of he was one of the first
persons to tell me he said hey we have
things out in the desert they would make
george lucas envious
and uh and but he i i said well how
about these things are you know flying
through you know through the sky at
thousands of miles an hour and they make
a 90 degree turn
he said
as long as they weren&#39;t manned
we have that capability this is back in
the 70s
right is it yeah and you said that the
technology used in the copperhead uh
you know
was it a flyable artillery shell i mean
it&#39;s it&#39;ll go to a specific you know
point on gps coordinates
uh yeah those things that&#39;s 400 g&#39;s when
they get when they get blasted out of
the cannon but but foxy said
he he has seen testing where an object
an unmanned object
going an extremely high rate of speed
and it stops in the dime or makes a 90
degree turn or does a 180
so fast that if there was anything in
there that wasn&#39;t that was
that wasn&#39;t tied down it would
end up
continue to go forward as you&#39;re going
into reverse
so that you know so that the uh
the technology that
conventional technology exists i mean i
i know i i think i mentioned it to you i
know i know i mentioned it to uh the
cousin brothers
that i actually
face to face with jeff babion asked him
how much alien technology is used in any
of the skunk works uh
programs and yeah i think he was very
very straightforward when he said said i
have no knowledge and when you look when
you&#39;re looking
straight into somebody&#39;s eyes
unless you&#39;re a politician
uh or a newscaster or a bunch of lion
rat bastards
it&#39;s just
when you&#39;re looking at i mean i&#39;m
from the distance i am away from my
monitor right now looking right at his
eyes is okay
how much alien technology and he said it
doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t pass through here
but my job is to look to the future not
look to the past
so he said it may be buried so deep when
they created it i will never i will
never not have an opportunity nor have a
need now he&#39;s he&#39;s retiring as of april
first
and this new guy going in and he&#39;s he&#39;s
going to be the proud recipient of one
of my blackbird books
because i know that that&#39;s what grease
the skids for me to get into cnc jeff
but there&#39;s uh
you know the
that the high-speed turning technology
existed a long time ago another thing
that
the same the same gentleman who
uh gave me the uh recording of the
american airlines uh tic tac flying by
him
uh he&#39;s one who who alerted me back
it&#39;s either 2015 or 2016. near glenwood
new mexico which is right on the border
of arizona
and new mexico
and there was a there was a tfr
issued you know 30 miles from this area
you can&#39;t fly
but the tfr was never listed officially
anywhere
whatever the object was
it was reported that it hit the ground
at 3 000 miles an hour
now i did talk to the fire chief in
glenwood he said shortly after the event
said we had so many you know white uh
dodge vans
going out there they had
cranes they had a flatbed truck they
were in there about two or three days
and it&#39;s it&#39;s a wilderness area it&#39;s a
primitive camping area now stu brown and
i
and we went back 20 some odd miles i
mean i know we were in arizona by the
time we decided to turn around
they had a
tractor and trailer with a
40 or 50 foot flatbed
behind it
coming out of the area there&#39;s there&#39;s
where we went
there&#39;s no way that it that a truck that
that long could make any of the turns
so
i&#39;ve been trying it i&#39;ve been trying to
get together yeah a group you know some
of them out of uh amarillo
at least stu brown out of uh albuquerque
and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna go in there
we need someone who
who has a commercial-grade
drone with with with high resolution and
we&#39;re going to just start scanning the
area because even after
seven or eight years
something crashed into the ground first
of all there&#39;s a road going to the
recovery site
and we haven&#39;t been able to find that
yet and covert you know put the kibosh
on it uh
right
out there and do it jim
if you need any help let us know
hey we&#39;re with the panel and um
we&#39;ve got a few minutes left but you
know this above top secret in working
with you guys has been incredible and i
know a lot of people are going to be
blown away when they watch this i think
i got another exclusive clip for
everybody so let&#39;s uh roll it and take a
look at this everyone
but governments can&#39;t die
so we need to find other incentives for
bureaucracy to adapt
and improve
the technology revolution has
transformed organizations across the
private sector
but not ours not fully
not yet
we are as they say
uh tangled in our anchor chain
our financial systems are decades old
according to some estimates we cannot
track 2.3 trillion dollars in
transactions well you don&#39;t just have
two three ten trillion dollars vanish
there&#39;s a whole system in place and it
comes from many different budgets
and then a big part of the funding comes
from private endeavors
so it isn&#39;t just government it&#39;s private
and government
together so i call this a hybrid entity
that&#39;s neither
strictly government nor strictly private
and interestingly from a secrecy point
of view
as a private entity corporate or citizen
penetrate these projects oh it&#39;s top
secret national security most of the
work being done on this are private
corporations northrop raytheon the old e
systems eg g and they&#39;ll say oh it&#39;s
proprietary
you see so if you come from the
government it&#39;s proprietary if you come
from corporate or civilian it&#39;s top
secret government so they kind of wall
it off they play that game it&#39;s like the
truman show if you look at that old show
jim carrey is playing this guy who his
whole life is raised in this sort of
fake set and wakes up one day and
realizes
my whole life has been this stage thing
so i think most people don&#39;t realize
we&#39;re living in in somebody&#39;s big truman
show here
the controllers i call them uh who who
orchestrate these things
and so we kind of have to go well we
need to have that jim carrey moment
where we kind of wake up
and realize
you know we&#39;ve been in a crazy truman
show here for 70 years since world war
ii
and
get real and that&#39;s what we need to do
above top secret again the link is below
it&#39;s streaming on all platforms and like
i say in the subtext over there the
technology behind disclosure and i think
you&#39;re gonna get a little bit of that in
this documentary because this technology
is superior and i think the whole idea
of grier dr greer is to have this free
energy you know we it&#39;s about time get
off the fossil fuels
again the the propulsion behind these
craft
we&#39;re going to have to wait a little bit
before we could utilize the propulsion
because of certain dangers and the
elements behind these craft moving at 30
000 miles per hour so
you know that&#39;s well and faster than
that i want to point out that
and by the way just as a point of
the
fact on this
there are objects that are man-made that
move in these right-hand turns at those
speeds there are ones that can be manned
but they had to develop a way to control
for one g
on board so it didn&#39;t matter so you have
a field think
view it as being in a bubble
around itself and it&#39;s moving
through space
at
x speed 100 000 kilometers an hour
makes a right hand turn but what&#39;s felt
on board is one g stable
that can be done
i am going to go spend a day or two with
bob lazar
oh wow i already and i&#39;m going to try to
i mean his his function the the movie
that jeremy put together was a promotion
for jeremy it had it really there was
not that much of bob in it
and i&#39;m going to see if i can convince
him
you know one way or the other to uh
sit down with
with the group here i don&#39;t care i mean
it doesn&#39;t have to be me it could be
michael you know it could be the you
know the cousin brothers it could be all
five of us
go to his place
and sit down and uh
that would be something
yes it would
yes it would yeah
and i&#39;m going to work on it i don&#39;t know
if i can pull it off but i&#39;m uh
i&#39;ve known him for 35 years so
we&#39;ll see what we can do
hey i mean i&#39;m in on the long haul i
mean i i know i&#39;m gonna live to be over
a hundred so i&#39;m i&#39;m gonna be
one of the troopers yeah
and uh
when you guys come out from hawaii uh
let&#39;s do it let&#39;s do a brainstorming on
going into glenwood
new mexico
you have uh
you have your uh
drone we got a drone and it works great
yeah
and we&#39;ll survey the area let&#39;s let&#39;s
put a grid together and let&#39;s go in
there i know about where where they went
in let&#39;s do it
we can take a look at that event did you
get an indication that it was
an extraterrestrial or a man-made that
malcolm
the fire marshal
that i talked to he said it was they
came in in the dead of night they
arrived
i mean it was uh it was like in the
movies
and it was just it was a huge procession
they were in the area for uh i think
they said three days
uh when they finally came out there was
a flatbed truck
there was something covered
yeah it wasn&#39;t very big
because you hit the ground at 3 000
miles an hour
uh if you&#39;re long you&#39;re going to be
really short
by the time they they dig you up well
the reason i ask that is that you know
i&#39;ve interviewed and met with a few guys
and one recently who was on a retrieval
team that was deployed for both
retrieving the man-made ones that
malfunctioned and the extraterrestrial
one
so
the question is which was this
uh maybe there&#39;s not enough data to
answer
when when they headed out this is per
the uh the fire marshal
everybody went south on was that highway
186 or 183 one
the one that goes through glenwood
if they were if it was
if it was uh operated out of kirkland
they would have headed north and they
had gone through reserve and gone
through
socorro and then up to
albuquerque but they headed south
and headed south you know you&#39;re heading
towards white sands
uh
or the old uh not the old alamogordo
there at holloman air force base
and they&#39;ve had you know they&#39;ve had uh
stuff come and go there you know as far
as
aircraft they had 117s and they had the
f-22 and they disappeared and they had
drones
and now they&#39;re back flying f-16s again
but that is that is a
if we can if we can
retrieve any material from that crash
site we only need a little piece
yeah
yeah and
we got people in the smithsonian and
they work at all the universities they&#39;d
be happy to take a look at any of this
materiel as uh career calls it any of
that stuff i know
with uh michael stratt in regards to
maybe the roswell medals somebody&#39;s
gotten in their archives it&#39;s hidden
somewhere and they&#39;re passing it down to
their their children and then their
their grandchildren and somebody&#39;s got
these medals and if they could come
forward with it we&#39;ve got the people
that are ready to analyze it and prove
that hey look this is something um
something otherworldly but again we only
have a few minutes left and again it&#39;s
been a pleasure hanging out with you
guys and meeting you guys in person last
year and then we&#39;re going to be doing it
this year what&#39;s crazy is when we
started filming our first trip was to
well first was los angeles with uh
michael schratt over there in santa
monica and then we hooked up with jim
goodall and then we&#39;re calling john de
souza and said hey we&#39;re in arizona
let&#39;s let&#39;s meet up and it so happened
two blocks from my house it was less
than a minute and a half from jim
goodall&#39;s place and they didn&#39;t even
know that they were in that close
proximity so that really was a
serendipity after all right and maybe
something special we felt was going on
in regards to this above top secret and
the knowledge behind it and the
information you guys bring man it&#39;s it&#39;s
rock solid and people are going to blow
their minds when they see this and
they&#39;re going to get pissed off too
because they should they should get
angry in regards to this technology
that&#39;s been hidden from us for
decades now so
any last words here uh john appreciate
you joining us over there in arizona and
uh man you brought it to the table in
this daca
i&#39;ll be just uh having local events here
in arizona just uh
just on general matters getting out the
word on a fake alien invasion
and the counterterror the counter
narrative for uh just for disclosure
that is going on and i&#39;ll also be uh
talking to people and showing them above
top secret that&#39;s coming out uh very
soon and that&#39;s gonna be really
important for people to see
and maybe we should do a midnight
screening at this uh you know this
conference we&#39;re doing in scottsdale
april
8th 9th and 10th i mean the the schedule
is all packed and closed but maybe we
can throw it up and people who want to
be night owls can take a look at it uh
be sort of fun for folks um i think that
you know there&#39;s going to be a lot of
interest i think as a consequence i know
after unacknowledged
we had a lot of resources come forward
and still coming forward absolutely and
all the
contacts for everybody on the panel will
be in the description below so if you
want to reach out to john d&#39;souza the
x-men and dr greer again the links and
then also michael shrek with his new um
it&#39;s actually blowing up on youtube
right now and it&#39;s one of the best
youtube channels out there and the
evidence is offering i agree
blue room media the documentation of the
historical archives that builds up to
these representations of the artists
work but man
apparently you got 60 000
documents so we&#39;re not you&#39;re gonna have
to stick around for a long time michael
stratt you got a lot of information
you&#39;re gonna have to put out to the
world we have a lot of work to do i&#39;ll
have some special surprises for you oh
yeah okay yeah i&#39;m looking forward to
looking forward to seeing you guys in
arizona
i have i have a i have a project for the
cousin brothers i have a friend of mine
who&#39;s retiring from nsa
i sent her an email and said you believe
in ufos and almost as soon as i hit send
i have a reply why did you see one
and i said no i&#39;ve just she said i can&#39;t
comment on this platform but they&#39;re
here
there was no question she said they&#39;re
here
so
there are a lot and remember there&#39;s a
lot of corruption goes with this in 1992
the head of army intelligence offered me
personally two billion dollars
if i would not do what i&#39;m doing
and went behind my back to my wife and
tried to get her to convince me to do it
i met with a man in 1993 at the wrigley
mansion
in phoenix there
and he pulled me aside it was this
midnight meeting with a bunch of these
guys
working this this issue and on the black
side
and he said look
we&#39;ve provided at least 10 million
dollars
to 10 000 people or more
to secure their cooperation
with our project and to keep it secret
and i say yes i know
the head of army intelligence offered me
two billion
from a uh after the soviet union fell in
the early 90s so they had confiscated a
bunch of assets in eastern europe and it
was a slush fund black pun and so
i said no thanks
but the reason we need to extend i i
understand exactly
firsthand how these guys operate it&#39;s
big golden sticks
uh and and and big golden carrots and
big clubs and they
don&#39;t mind swinging the gold in front of
you or swinging the club yeah we got
them by the horns everybody we we&#39;re
going to get this and we got to get rid
of the shorties yeah
we do we do
things are happening it&#39;s quite exciting
people need to buckle up but uh it&#39;s
about it&#39;s about time right everybody
hey absolutely that being said
guys appreciate it good work on
getting the information out we&#39;re really
excited about this above top secret
again the link is below but be safe
we&#39;re gonna be meeting up with everybody
again here very shortly and we look
forward to seeing you all and uh keep
your eyes on the skies everybody blake
cousins we&#39;ll see ya thank you next time
all right bye-bye everybody there
everybody thank you
you guys have a good night
you
