  		              		Experience Description   

    I was tail ended in a car accident, I seemed to be ok but one year later the medics told me I needed to undergo spinal surgery, if I did not go ahead there was strong chance that I would lose the ability to walk. My father funeral was the day before surgery but I was willing to go ahead and said nothing. The medics called to say there was an unforeseen emergency and surgery was cancelled for one week.  The pre-op and operation appeared to go well without any issues. I am wheeled out of surgery and placed in post-op ward with 5 other people, I am not lucid, quite possibly out from post op medicine/painkillers. I remember nothing until I am awoken by a loud noise. I look to the source of the noise, it is the monitoring machine next to my bed, its alarm is going off and I notice that all the readings are blank. I remember thinking to myself that does not look good. A young nurse came running into ward, I can hear her footsteps as she approaches and when she is next to me she checks machine then runs off. 

    Several medics arrive with young nurse and a new machine, they close the curtains that surround my bed, they detach original machine and start working. I know I am sitting up but I do not remember looking at my body which was flat out on bed. As the medics work I am overcome with an incredibly intense feeling that I am no longer part of their world.  I am absolutely aware that for me linear time is no longer relevant, I am part of something else, something where linear time no longer matters. I am struck by this feeling and as I watch the three medics do their work this sense of detachment from linear time becomes stronger.  I can see their world and know that I am in a different place where time as I knew it does not matter. I am aware that if I wanted to I could fast forward or rewind linear time, but I choose not to, I am engrossed with events around me. 

    I can see everything at once as if I have fish eye lenses, 360 degree vision. There is an older nurse, slightly overweight, I remember her having died blond hair, her roots were growing through. She is constantly talking in my left ear - 'come on David, stay with us David... repeat, repeat, repeat.' Although I am aware of and can see everything happening around me, I can see the medics trying to revive me, one is at my feet, it is the older nurse still speaking in my ear- 'come on David, stay with us...' that seems to hold my attention. 

    All of a sudden the closed curtains around my bed open and two small, swarthy males dressed in shabby clothes pull back the curtain and stand looking at me. Their sudden and unexpected entrance diverts my attention away from the elderly nurse speaking in my ear. We look at each other while the medics do their work and I momentarily think what are the orderlies doing here. The man facing me on my right smiles and any thoughts I have about orderlies vanish. As we watch each other he speaks to me without talking and makes an inquisitive gesture as he says to me- 'well, are you coming?' I decline his offer and everything goes blank. 

    When I come round it is mid-morning and I am quickly surrounded by medics doing their job, I do not remember much detail but I do remember two things, the other five patients in my ward are all staring at me with a mixture of trepidation, fear and awe! The older Female nurse who was speaking in my ear telling me to stay with them waits until the medics have finished with their checks and moved on before she leans in close and says - 'you had us really worried last night David, you had us really worried.'

What is your religion now?         Unaffiliated- Nothing in particular- Religious unaffiliated     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I have had an ill-defined sense of God and another world for over 35 years now. I have never felt the need to explore or express it and have never been drawn to any religious creed. There have been several instances in my life that I am certain occurred either to save me from imminent danger or were experienced as a reminder/guide that there is indeed another life beyond death and that there is something we humans call God.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         No       

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   The two men that pulled back the curtains as I watched the nurse talking in my ear were from a different realm. When they first entered I briefly thought they must be hospital staff but as they looked at me that feeling vanished and I knew I was looking at someone from a different place.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I actually saw them  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     There was an overpowering sense of being part of a different world where human kind and linear time were completely separate.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     The whole experience only reinforced my belief. The meeting with the two men that entered my space as the medics worked and the way they communicated with me can only be described as out of this world. I already had a strong sense of God due to a variety of incidents that defy explanation from a scientific point of view. NB I was brought up in a secular/scientific household that openly mocked the concept of God. My own belief cannot be put down as memetic influence.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   God is real, there is another realm beyond death and death should not be feared.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.  This experience only confirmed an already strong but ill-defined belief in God and a different form of existence to the one we perceive on earth.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         No       

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life     I deplore irrational hatred of others even more than I did before. I have little time for selfish people.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.   I can remember with absolute clarity. When I first started to write this 4 days ago I suddenly felt that sense of detachment from the human world that I experienced during the described episode.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     Have always suffered from ability to dream about future events in minute detail, I still do but they do not worry me so much. I can sense evil far better than before.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Talking with angels and having my pre operation desire/prayers to live for my children answered  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    A friend about two years ago, his brother had died several years prior to our conversation and I could tell that he was hurting and seeking answers/solace. My wife six months ago shortly after her father died.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   When I was four years old I had a bad accident in nursery school. I was in a bad way and was unable to move any muscles on right side of body for about three months.  Memories of floating downstairs and hovering outside living room door as parents talked. Many incidents that can only be described in supernatural terms.  

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     There was an intense reality to everything as it happened.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     Confirmation of an afterlife, confirmation that I have unfinished business and that I will not die until this unfinished business is concluded.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   When I started to write this four days ago I started to think about it and suddenly I was able to feel and sense everything in the same way as it happened then. It did not last for long but I have never experienced that feeling on any other occasion.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I was on holiday about five years ago and I was regaling the story for the first time to a couple that stayed on same block. This was the first time I had ever spoken about it with anyone. As I an talking they went pale when I mentioned linear time no longer being important and how I was apart from it.  They looked at each other and the woman said to her partner -"that is exactly what your mother said."  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         It may be helpful to ask of any psychic experiences prior to event and how they impact on perception of world around them and of event itself.
