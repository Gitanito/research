The Fifty-sixth Anniversary of the
Theosophical Society
A D Y A R , 24-29 DECEMBER. 1931
THhe Annual Convention of the Society was held at Adyar
1 from December 24th to December 29th, 1931, and was
attended by about 540 delegates. The Sections in India, Burma,
Ceylon, America, England, Wales, Scotland, South A nca,
Switzerland, Holland, Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
w
ere represented by their nationals. At the openi g
of Convention it was not expected that Dr. Besant, t
President, would be strong enough to be present, so the ice
President, Mr. A. P. Warrington, had been requested to give
th
e annual address to the Society. At the last momen ,
however, Dr. Besant determined to appear, so she descen e
in the lift, and sat in a chair, while Mr. Warrington gave the
following Vice-Presidential Address. At its eloe®, to e
amazement and delight of all, Dr. Besant rose an a re
the gathering in a clear, powerful voice. The two addresses
are printed below in the order in which they were given.

service, unfortunately is not physically able to be a
c
tiv
e
ly
with us to-day. My regret for this is very deep, and1a
m
sure yours is also. But can we not hope that her in
d
isp
o
si­
tion is only temporary ; that it is caused by duties o
f a
weightier nature in those realms where the larger p
a
rto
f
her splendid nature functions, and that ere we m
eet h
e
r
e
again she will be restored to health for further activity in
this world, that is ill-prepared to spare one so superbly fitte
d
to bring to it the enlightened services it so gravely n
e
ed
s?
At all events I am sure this will be the prayer of thoseofu
s
whose hearts are sincerely devoted to the welfare of h
u
m
an
ity
in general and of our Society in particular.
Under the Constitution of our Society the duties of th
e
President, when he or she is absent, fall upon the V
ice­
President. And so it becomes my duty to open this Conven­
tion and to lay before you a statement of the activities of th
e
Society during the year which has just closed.
But before submitting to you the details of the reports o
f
the National Societies, which have been condensed an
d
assembled for me by our very efficient and faithful Recording
Secretary, and which I shall presently ask him to read to
you, I should like to bring into my brief remarks the influence
of the President by drawing your attention to the inspiring
ideals she expressed at the Convention of last year, for th
ey
are even more fitting to-day than they were when she uttered
them.
It may be, there are a few who will remember what she
said then, but I doubt that there are many ; for memory 'D
our crowded lives often proves to be but a poor servant, and
fails us when we most need it. All the greater need therefore
that we be reminded occasionally of the best our ideals require
of us in the daily life—always lest we forget.
In her address she made dear the inalienable right that
each has to embrace the opportunity we now have of bringing
1932 THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 6 0 3
I th
e Elder Brothers into our daily lives. “ Each can judge for
I h
im
self,” she said, “ how far he cares to come nearer to
T
h
e
ra
, with all the implications that go with that approach;
w
h
eth
er he is willing to accept those implications, to make
th
e changes demanded by them, and thus to learn gradually
h
o
wtoco-operate with the Elder Brothers in our world.” She
adds: “ There are few subjects more fascinating, more attrac­
tive; but it is also necessary that we should realize the truth
of that which I just quoted from one of them—‘ You must
co
m
eout of your world into ours
Then she mentions the special relation that two of the
M
asters have with the Theosophical Society, the Society that
w
a
sin reality founded by Them as a special instrument in the
service of Humanity and has been under Their observation
a
n
d influence substantially ever since. And what is the
n
ature of the service which Beings so exalted expect of their
servers in this Society ? Their answer is quoted by the Presi­
d
en
t with her own strong emphasis: “ The so-called small
services in daily life count as much with us as the so-called
greater services ” ; and she reminds us of the wisdom of this
attitude toward service, counselling that it is the little things
°f life that help us to form the habit o f service, which could
never come about if we waited for the larger opportunities
w
hich only come rarely.
The final remarks of the President had reference to what
in the humble opinion of your present speaker, a fact of
the most vital importance to the Society, namely, the fact that
Adyar was the place “ chosen by the Masters for the Centre,
to which they sent her (H. P. B.) that she might live there for
aom
e time and create there an atmosphere which would make
it easy for it to receive Their influence, or any spiritual influ­
ence that was sent ”. She declares that “ there is a direct
communication between Adyar and Shamballa ” of the White
Island of old, and that here it was intended that sojourners

w ty 10 the Centre is “"fortunately not b
e

a
s
te
r
s
'
concerned. Therefore she, as President of our S
o
cie
ty
)
os earnestly appealed to us for help with the AdyarJ>ptre,

v

so e y or India, but indeed for the whole world ofTheo-
• an^ even beyond into all the functions of our m
o
d
em
tion a magnificent consummation which can b
e
attained if we will, by right will and by right work.
After calling for the practice of more Brotherhood ino
u
r
even towards our younger brethren of the a
n
im
a
l
S om, our President closed her impressive address b
y
inding us of what many of us believe to be v
e
ry
true, that the best preacher and the best m
achinery
for spreading Theosophy
Life
is by leading the Theosopbical
hese reminders, friends, were not given merely a
s
©t ical guidance for the individual but, coming to us, as th
ey
id, from the President at an annual meeting of the Societyi
t ey have all the force which usually pertains to an executive
declaration of corporate policy.
Then, let us remember that the existence of the Per­
fected Men must ever be an inevitable fact of evolution ; that
it was at the instance of two of these that the Society w
as
ounded , that it is by Them that it has been nurtured and
sustained from within, and that, if it shall ever reach its high
goal in the future, it will be because it has been vivified and
pired by Them, far more than because it has been wisely
and efficiently conducted by U8 down here. Says the Presi­
d en t: It is a personal matter for each to decide. But I
would ask you to remember that on Their help andon Their
fi0 5
1932 T H E P R E S ID E N T IA L A D D R E S S
blessin
g, and on our working along lines They laid down, the
lifeof our Society really depends.”
This was the attitude held by H.P.B. and Colonel Olcott
a
n
d it has been that ever since of every vital and inspire
w
ork
er in the Movement, whether leader or otherwise.
But let us not forget, in our intense realization of the
im
portance of this viewpoint, that it is an attitude that has t
com
e to one from within, and never can be impose rom
without; for the doors of the Society stand wide open
receive those who, while believing in Brotherhood, nevert
less have no belief in Masters as facts as well as ideals, F
th
o
se who do so believe are left free in forming, eac
him
self, his own conceptions as to these great Beings,
w
hat his personal relations to Them may be.
In looking over the reports of the various Gen
Secretaries of the Society, it appears, as you will se ,
there has been a substantial reduction in members ip
practically every Section. For the most part the financia
depression is given as the reason. But we have passe
through financial depressions in different countries many
tim
es before without finding so great an effect even locally ,
and so, it is important for us to study more carefully than
ever before the causes of our present conditions. n ,
self-criticism cannot do us any harm, and we mu* see above
all things that in the Society we have a rea y wi m
meet the new thoughts of the world on t eir ow
and to consider then, in the light of what 1
mow1 dge w,^ may
have and in a way that will not cause the world to «»take
Theosophy for a creed, and the Theosoph.ca Society for he
osopny ror but will help rather in the
organized exponent of a d of 8ervera searching for truth
realization that we are a b „nutations
and more truth, and not a body noun y
which a creed invariably entails. We are bound together by

New s of th e Nation al Societies
IT. S . o f A m e r ic a : The new General Secretary, Mr. S
id
n
e
y
Cook, who has taken the place so ably filled for m
any y
e
a
r
s
by Mr. Rogers, who is now devoting himself to the le
c
tu
re
field, reports a year of great activity. In addition tom
a
n
y
lectures given by Mr. Rogers, Miss Clara Codd, Mr. G
eo
ffrey
Hodson and others, propaganda activities are shown inth
e
sale of 16,000 books and 12,000 pamphlets. The C
on
ven
tion
and Summer School were once more a great success. A n
e
w
system of classified memberships, equal in their privileges, b
u
t
giving to wealthier members the opportunity of a m
em
bership
classification which involves more liberal contribution, h
a
s
been put into force, and has brought in additional funds. T
h
e
General Secretary remarks that the reduction in m
em
bership
appears to be now abating, there being a net loss of only 3
4
0
members. The number of Lodges remains as before at 209.
E n g la n d : The report for England shows a reduction o
f
364 in membership, the total being now 4,224, and the n
u
m
b
er
of Lodges is now 150— one more than the figure given tou
s
last year. The General Secretary explains that the declineis
due mainly to the financial crisis through which the w
h
ole
world is passing, which deprives many people of the m
ean
s,
time and energy required for anything more than the d
aily
needs of themselves and their families. There is, however, a
steadying down throughout the Section. Members are “ carry­
ing on,” and seem to have decided that many problems ca
n
only be solved with the passing of time or the gaining of m
o
re
knowledge and wisdom. The combining of the Annual C
on
­
vention with the European Congress presided over by B
ishop
Arundale brought many brethren to England. Classes an
d
special meetings are being held at Headquarters, and th
e
Headquarters Library has a marked increase in the number of
subscribers. “ One Day Campaigns” were continued—in April
jg32 THE P R E S ID E N T IA L A D D R E S S
w
ith “ Karma, Bondage or Freedom,“ and in November with
“T
h
e Evolution of Man”. Two thousand books prepare o
th
e next campaign have already been sold. Study ee en
are also very popular and useful.
India: The General Secretary for India reports muc
m
o
re decision and steadiness than in the previous ye ’ _
w
h
e
n despairing factors have come in. The machinery o
constitutionhas worked without much creaking during y
B
om
bay and its suburban Lodges were constituted into a
autonom
ous Federation. No Federation shows increa
m
em
bership, and the total membership decrease r
5,518 to 4,728, the chief decline being in Lodge mem ers ip,
th
e unattached membership having fallen only fom •
3

,1
. Much of the loss is attributed to, preoccupa ion _
political uncertainty and financial depression, an t e ^
n
ew admissions is similarly explained. The rp es app y ^
la
p
se o{ membership have been strictly enforced. 1
ofactive Lodges has declined from 324 to 2ft1.
The General Secretary considers that the realtes* °, ^
w
ork of the Lodges is in their usefulness to their sur™ ^ . _
a
n
d the country, and by this test the core of t e wor -
sound and bears promise of a, new fife. It con 1

and to inculcate self-reliance and sympathy. His plea iso

more for welcoming into the Section the teaching thatt

teaching is welcome in the Society, then the Teacher m

He concludes with the aspiration “ May the d a y com

A u stra lia : The General Secretary reports great eco
n
o
m
ic
difficulties, which have caused every Lodge to redu ce its
expenditure. The Broadcasting Station continues its g
o
o
d
work, and is paying its way and showing a profit, som e o
f
which will go to the Section. The statistics show 1.499 mem­
bers and 31 Lodges. The Convention was held in M elbourne,
and what were called “ Support Conventions” were h e ld atthe
same time in other cities, for those who were not a b le to make
the long journey to Melbourne. The Headquarters has b
e
e
n
removed to The Manor, at Mosman. The “ Advance A ustralia I
News Service ” continues, and is much appreciated by m
an
y
editors, who are accepting at least 200 columns per m on th .
S w ed en : The number of members in Sweden has decreased
a little, but the General Secretary reports that the Section h
a
s
gained in consolidation and inner strength. The membership
is now 728. The Summer School held at Stockholm, w
h
ich
was directed by Mr. E. Bolt of Edinburgh, was attended b
y
100 members, of whom about 10 came from Norway.
N e w Z ea la n d : The General Secretary reports with regret
that the membership of the Section has now fallen below 1,000,
the total being 971. The Sectional magazine continues to b
e
sent free to all members in good standing. Pamphlets o

all new members. The Vasanta Farm has now been purchased
from the Section by Mr. Colin Macdonald, who has looked
after it so well for over 19 years. The Vasanta Garden
School continues its good work, and receives appreciative
reports.
H olland: The report from Holland shows the admission of
102 new members, and the dropping of 322. It is remarked
that although there is a fall in numbers there are signs of
renewed enthusiasm in the Section, the fall having been due
largely to causes in the previous year and at the beginning of
the current year. The Publishing House continues its
activities and there is in preparation a very cheap edition of
The Secret D o ctrin e, which is to be brought out with the help
°f a fund raised in memory of Mr, W . B. Fricke. The book
w
ill be sold for only 6 guilders. The two Magazines D e
Theosofische B ew eg in g and T heosophia have now been combined
into one.
F ran ce : The General Secretary reports that 5 new Lodges
have been chartered and 5 have become dormant, which leaves
the number at 79, as before. 218 new members have joined
and 416 have dropped away, leaving a total of 3,175. The
Headquarters has continued its lectures and other activities
and there have also been visiting lecturers, including the
General Secretary of the T.S. in Holland, Dr. J. J. van der
Leeuw, the General Secretary of the T.S. in Germany,
Hr. M. Verweyen, and Dr. G. S. Arundale.
I t a l y : The General Secretary reports that though it was
impossible to have public lectures during this year, the Lodges
have been meeting regularly. The magazines H L o to and
Gnosis have continued, and the Publishing House has reprinted
Light on the Path and The P erfu m e o f E g y p t. The new
Italian Penal Code was issued on July 1st, and therefore the

S co tla n d . Scotland has now 558 members, as co
m
p
ared
wit 612 m the previous year. There are 29 Lodges. T
h
e
rst part of the year was given to intensive study inth
e
ges rather than to propaganda. Later, Mrs. P
ow
ell
an Mr. Groves gave a series of lectures. The Section is
w twenty one years old. Although there is decrease in
mbership, the General Secretary reports very keen in
terest
among the members, and also among the public who a
r
e
attracted to the lectures.
S w itzerla n d reports a very active year and an u

atmosphere of brotherhood at the Annual Convention, at w

nearly all the Lodges were represented. The General Secretary
says that Geneva has been “ ploughed with Theosophy,” a
n

she thinks that there are very many more Theosophists ou
tsid
e
t e Society than within it. 12 members have joined during
t e year, mostly in Lausanne, on account of Dr. de Henseler’s
weekly lectures there. 10 members resigned, 2 died, 100
came dormant, so there are now 260 members, of whom 170
ave paid their dues. The number of Lodges is 13. Though
.-a. *n number, the members are active in many ways, in
amerent associations.

Mr. T- Kennedy as editor. _
M e x i c o : The General Secretary reports a m
em
bershipof
a smaN increase, and also very much activity, apparently
quite out of proportion to the number of members. There w
as
no special series of public lectures this year, but the meetings
on special days attracted large audiences. On these occasions
Fraternity and Art were the most prominent features.
Propaganda of the teachings of Krishnaji has been carried o
n
every Sunday at Headquarters. Señora Consuelo R. de Aldag,
a Mexican lady who is a lecturer of the United States Section,
visited her own country for two months and did some very good
work. The publication department showed considerable
activity. The Sectional magazine of 40 pages appears every
two months and is sent free to every member, to many foreign
Spanish-speaking Lodges, to the 30 Governors of the interior
and to the public Libraries. There is also a monthly p
ap
er
containing lectures by Krishnaji and Dr. Besant, which is
widely distributed.

Canada: The General Secretary for Canada expresses
g
rea
t satisfaction at the revival during the year of what he
ca
lls the Blavatsky tradition in the T. S. He gives his opinion
th
a
t if Krishnaji had studied T h e S ecret D o c trin e as Madame
B
lavatsky proclaimed it, he would not have found the ideals
s
h
epromulgated to be different in principle from his own. The
C
anadian Section has always been prominent in endeavours to
b
rin
g about harmony among members of various Theosophical
Societies, and notes with pleasure .the fraternization meetings
w
h
ich have been held in many places in America and Europe,
b
u
t expresses regret that in this movement some have not been
content with co-operation but have tried to cause other
m
em
bers and organizations to change their folds. He also
com
m
ents with satisfaction on the issues of T he T heosophist
fo
r August and September— the Blavatsky Centenary numbers.
Statistically, Canada shows a good year, with a decrease
of only 16 members in these hard times. There are now 397
m
em
bers in good standing on the rolls. Lack of funds has
prevented any extensive propaganda work, but The Canadian
Theosophist has continued to be the chief propaganda activity.
Argentina : The General Secretary reports that the state
of his Section is satisfactory and allows for optimism for the
future. There has been a disagreement with the General
Council of the Section on the part of some of the Branches,
w
hich have applied for direct affiliation to the Headquarters at
Adyar. This matter is still under consideration. The statistics
of the Section show a membership of 343 in 21 Lodges.
C h ile: Chile reports a year of exceptional difficulties, and
a small drop in membership-to 181. The Sectional magazine
has been amalgamated with El T eo so fo S u d -A m erica n o. The
General Secretary reports a reduction in the activities of the
Lodges but says that they are determined firmly to maintain
the organization of the Society, and to preserve for coming
generations the treasure represented by the Ancient Wisdom.

t h e th e o so p h ist march
B r a z i l : The number of members is 379, being 87 lessth
a
n
ast year, and there are 15 Lodges. There has been re
v
iv
ifi-
ation of some Lodges, and an increase of general in
terestin
lheosophical teachings, and propaganda has been done w
ith
the help of the daily press and radio as well as by oral lectu
r«
and teachings. Six pamphlets have been issued for p
rop
agan
d
a
purposes. It is much to be regretted that the project fo
ra
eadquarters building has to be postponed, partly b
e
c
a
u
se
of the present financial crisis and partly because h
a
lf
of the fund for construction of headquarters has been lo
s
t
on account of the insolvency of the establishment in w
h
ichit
was deposited. The official magazine 0 Teosophista co
n
tin

es
to be published regularly. The publicity section under th
e
direction of Dr. Louren^o de Mattos Borges has three d
ep
a
rt­
ments, dealing with pamphlets, press work and radio w
o
r
k
respectively. Short articles are distributed weekly to all th
e
newspapers of the various Brazilian States, and many ta
lk
s
have been broadcast through various radio stations in K
iod
e
Janeiro.
In August a Blavatsky week was held in Rio de Janeiro,
m which many orators and musicians took part. At the sa
m
e
time one of the biggest bookshops in the city lent their p
rin
ci­
pal window for a display of Theosophical books and a la
rg
e
photograph of H. P. B. The General Secretary mentions th
a
t
the members are studying with much attention the teachings
of Mr. Krishnamurti, without seeing in them any incom
pati­
bility with Theosophical work.
B u lg a r ia : This year there has been considerable p
u
b
lic
activity of the T. S. in Bulgaria, notwithstanding the difficul­
ties of the time. A long series of lectures was given by various
members on a variety of Theosophical subjects, and the L

Iceland: In Iceland we have a large number of members
fo
r such a small place, namely 276, but they are now con
e
d in only 5 Lodges. Most of the Lodges have had regular
fortnightly meetings, with lectures and discussions, m y
having been on the subject of Krishnaji s teachings, w 10
a source of wide inspiration. Two radio talks were given on

B

League,” which is working to spread the knowledge o
survival after bodily death. .
Spain; Notwithstanding great political distur ance in
| Spain, the year’s work shows very good results, there being a
n
et loss of only 2 members. The General Secretary is enthusi­
astic about the prospects of theosophical work un er
' circumstances, and thinks that the theosophical phi o«»phy

Convention of the T. S. in Wales, which was presided overby
shop Leadbeater, and was attended also by other distinguish*
e visitors. The membership returns show a decline of 2

,
w ich is less than 10 per cent. Mrs. Margaret Evans has le
ft
e Section £100, which is being used for propaganda w
o
rk
.
As usual, the members in Wales are busy in a great num
bero
f
social service movements.
P o la n d . The General Secretary writes that there is ala
rg
e
rop in membership this year, because it was decided tocro
ss
rom the rolls a number of members who had taken no part in
the Society for some time, paid no fees, and did not replyto
any letters. At the same time, care was taken not to eliminate
t o-e whose lack of contact with the Society was likely tob
e
only temporary or due to external circumstances. The m
em
ber­
ship is now ¿32, and the number of Lodges has fallen to 1
0
.
The Summer School was attended by 60 people, mostly non­
members. The meditation and study classes were also w
e
ll
attended, again mostly by non-members. The Secretary
remarks that she thinks the causes of weakening of interest in
Theosophy are two the conditions of economic, political an
d
social life, and “ our inability to present a broad and w
ise
solution, based on the Ancient Wisdom, of many difficult
questions of to-day in social and political life
U ru g u a y : The General Secretary for Uruguay reports that
conditions in her country are very promising. Although som
e
4
.-ii^eS are ^
>econ^'n^
> inactive and some members indifferent,
sti 1 great renovation is going on. The 10 Lodges are described
1932 THE PRESIDEN TIAL ADDRESS 621
a
s 7 active, 2 inactive and l dormant. 3 Lodges have
b
e
e
n organized. In addition to the ordinary lectures, radio
ta
lk
s were given on three occasions by the General Secretary.
O
n
e of the most important events of the year was the Second
International Congress of the South American Theosophical
Federation. The first number of the South A m erica n T h eo­
sophist, which replaces several sectional magazines, was
b
rou
gh
t out at the time of the Blavatsky Centenary.
Porto R i c o : The membership in Porto Rico is now 179, as
com
pared with 210 last year, on account of various reasons.
T
h
eGenera] Secretary writes that the Section has gone through
j a real “ cyclone ” and that in some of the Lodges only 4 or 5
m
em
bers have paid their dues. 2 Lodges have ceased, and two
m
o
re are on the point of disappearing. It was decided at the
Annual Convention that if more than one member of a family
belongs to the Society, they may pay at the rate of half the
| u
su
a
l membership fee each. The Lodge at the capital of the
I Dom
inican Republic is reported to be full of life and enthu-
( siasm
, and doing good propaganda work in spite of the
h
a
rdtimes.
R oum ania: The work in Roumania is being carried on
chiefly by the Lodges, acting independently of one another.
There are eleven Lodges existing in eight different towns. The
Vasanta Lodge in Chisinau, near the Russian boundary, is
com
posed almost entirely of Russian members, and it is the
m
ost active Lodge. In the West there are two Lodges which
. have been the mainspring of the Anti-alcoholic Movement
of their province, so that the International Order of Good
Templars of that region has become the centre for the whole
country. In the Capital, Bucharest, the activities are not so
great, but regular lectures are now being given. The
- Sectional magazine is published monthly.
J u g o s l a v i j a : The General Secretary reports that much
enthusiasm and activity has been shown in the Section during
A
622
the year. 23

h
e
o
-
sop y is becoming more common in the Press. A T
heosophical
Publishing Trust was formed
H. P. B. Centenary celebrations.
,, C e y lo n . The General Secretary mentions that, in spiteo
f
e epression, the year s activities have created a m
o
r
e
avourable attitude among the public and a more exp
an
d
ed
conception of Theosophy. It is good to hear that the member-
e ip has been increasing. The year began with 106 a
n
d
ended with 121, but it is mentioned that a large number of th
e
members are in arrears with their dues, and that therea
r
e
great financial difficulties in the Section. The most a
ctiv
e
Lodge is the Youth Lodge.
G r e e c e . The report from Greece is not very encouraging
this year. A new Lodge has been formed in Cyprus, a
n
d
several other Lodges are quite active, but the membership h
a
s
fallen to 140. The General Secretary explains this as dueto
two causes, namely, the economic conditions and the influence
of Krishnajis teachings. The publication of the quarterly
magazine has been continued.
C en tra l A m eric a : Central America reports serious difficul­
ties on account of acute economic conditions. But th
ere
remain in all places nuclei of faithful and steady workers w
h
o
keep alight the fire of Theosophical idealism and constitute
a well founded hope that when present handicaps disappear a
bright development may take place”. In the Republic of
Colombia Theosophy i8 spreading very rapidly, and th
e
General Secretary for Central America expects that a»
1932 THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 623
autonom
ous Section will be established there before long.
T
h
e
reare now 14 Lodges in this Section, and 189 members.
Central Zouth A fr ic a : The General Secretary in Central
S
o
u
th Africa reports a useful year and a present membership
o
f 206, with 9 Lodges. He describes this year as An
H
. P
. B. Year”. The Section has used H. P. B.’s works in
stu
d
yclasses, arranged for a number of addresses on H. P. B. s
life, and obtained publicity about her in the press. The annual
H
. P
. B
. lecture at Convention was given by Mrs. Ransom, who
h
a
s also done a great deal of work especially in the Rand
section
, and has written a book entitled M a d a m e B la va tsk y
as Occultist Miss Norah Bennett, from Australia, is also
helping in that Section. In Pretoria Miss Turner, the President,
! d
o
e
s much to bring the movement into touch with other social
; activities of many kinds. South Africa’s biggest problem is
j th
e racial one, and the Section is therefore paying a good deal
°f attention to the development of justice and harmony in
th
isrespect.
P eru : (No report.)
UNSECTIONALIZED LODGES
China : We have no report from the Presidential Agent for
China, as Mr. Manuk has been travelling abroad almost all this
year. But the Shanghai L o d g e Secretary reports that it has
m
oved to better quarters during the year, and it did not suspend
its activities during the months of July and August, as is usual.
The Lodge has been considerably strengthened by a special
Propaganda effort made last February, so although 7 members
resigned on account of leaving Shanghai there is a gain of one
member. The Besant School for girls has done good work,
with 500 students. The H on g K o n g L o d g e also reports
removal to new premises. This Lodge has held 79 meetings,
of which 26 were public leotures, and its proceedings are

J a p a n . The M i r o k u L o d g e reports that fortnightly m
eet-
gs ave been held regularly during the year for the study an
d
iscussion of Theosophical works. Though the membership is
ma 1, it is reported that the members are now mostly Japanese
and there is a sincere interest in the study of Theosophy. D
iffi-
cu ties of translation are still a handicap to a wider circulation
o iterature in Japan. Countess Ina Metaxa has returned to
Greece, after presenting many books to the Lodge library.
C a n a d a . H . P . B . L o d g e . . The Secretary reports a
membership o f 12, 2 members having become inactive during
the year. The study of Krishnaji’s writings having proved
very interesting and helpful, the Lodge proposes to continue
this during the com ing winter.
No reports from Egypt, Canadian Federation, Paraguay
and Kuala Lumpur.

here she gave the Presidential Address and one lecture iD
ecember, 1930. Unfortunately, her health has been far from

th

August, and has also been present at a few garden part
u
nder the big banyan tree in Blavatsky Gardens. o^g
very weak, she has not been suffering pain, and 8 6
constantly been surrounded by loving friends. Throug ou

m
ent of her financial affairs. Bishop Leadbeater has also e
at hand, except when aw ay from A dyar on lecturing to
Latterly, the presence of Bishop and Mrs. Arundale has ee
source of special happiness to her, and she has also
appreciated the visit which is being paid by two of her ry
old co-workers and friends— Rad Bahadur G . N . Chakra a
and Mr. Bertram Keightley. A t the moment of w riting^
is no visible prospect of any great improvement in t e resi
dent’s health, but if it were possible for loving personal care
and the good thoughts of thousands of people all over the wori
to work wonders, we should soon have her moving again
amongst us in something of her old strengt .
Mr. Jinar&jaddsa has resided constantly at Adyar, and
given a very large part of hie tim e and energy to t
