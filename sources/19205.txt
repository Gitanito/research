if you&#39;re traveling beyond the speed of
light I call it the crossing point of
light it&#39;s like this beyond the sound
barrier well there&#39;s something beyond
the light barrier and you&#39;re going from
say the andromeda galaxy that&#39;s two and
a half million light-years away
so at the speed of light it would take
two and a half million years for them to
get here this be the lights too slow
you cannot go from point A to B through
the cosmos through a linear system of
transportation moreover you cannot
communicate through those distances with
something at the speed of light which is
what your cell phone and all these
radiofrequency electromagnetic
communication devices we use now on
earth are using any civilization that is
here that is interstellar by definition
is transdimensional they&#39;re passing
through other dimensions and dropping
out of linearity and going from A to B
boom almost like a teleportation where
it&#39;s a that resonant effect from point A
to B any communications systems that
these ETS have are also going at the
speed of not light but of thought quanta
of thought we think of consciousness and
thought is this sort of amorphous
irrelevant interesting but mystical
thing but the central operating system
and communication system for all
interstellar civilizations is
consciousness and thought and
technologies that interface with them
