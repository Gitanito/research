  		              		Experience Description   

    I was riding on my bicycle, when it started slipping and I could not keep my bike upright. What happened afterwards, I don't remember. I only remember people calling me and asking if I was okay because  I was lying on the ground. Days later when I talked about my accident, I said that I THOUGHT I had died. I didn't yet realize that it wasn't just a thought.  
  
  The doctors in osteopathy made it clear that I had died.  
  
  I was in a darkness the kept getting  darker. I realized that I was dead. At that moment, I  felt the unbelievable love-filled concept that  I was really dead. I felt peace and tranquility. It was so good. I also felt a border. It was like an  endless wall that I could not go through or over. I was in the nothing and yet I was in everything. I was free of my body,  alone, not in a room, and yet there was a feeling of  a wall.
  
  Then I had the understanding that I could come back here or  I could  choose to go back to my earthly life.  I was sucked back into my body and I heard people calling asking if everything was okay.  
  
  After I became aware of this experience, I was really confused. It was strange to think that I  had chosen to live. Why? It felt so good being over there, so why did I want to come back here?  
  
  And now, two years later, my confusion has increased. I feel alienated by nearly all the people around me. Luckily, that feeling doesn't extend to  my husband and children. I can tell this story but can feel that nobody understands me.  I feel very good now in knowing what is right or not in everything I do, say, or write, but my old self can't handle this reality yet. I know who my Godly self is but my old self will not yet grant her admission because I can't yet let go of my old self.

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   This is hard to describe because I was in another dimension. I was alone, in the now. There were no distractions and  no incentives. I was  alone while experiencing love and tranquility.  
  
  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         At that same moment that I knew I was dead. The feeling I got was very intense, pure love.  
  
Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     For me there was no time there.  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       My experience was not visual.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      There was no sound during my experience.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         No  

Did you see an unearthly light?         No     

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         No

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      Other or several faiths   I was not a believer in God but I did believe in a higher power or energy. I had a feeling there was something.  
  
  Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Spirituality has become very important to me. I cannot be without meditation, in whatever form, such as writing, yoga, reading, and serenity.  
  
  What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant.   I now know that our soul is separate from our body and that this soul lives on after our bodily death.  
  
  Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was entirely not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience.     Before the accident, I had heard only of tunnel experiences and light which didn't have  in my experience. So I long doubted my own experience. Was this really an NDE? No tunnel, no light, and no contact with the departed. Although I knew it was real, this made acceptance of my NDE  a little more difficult.  
  
  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     Many values I had already abandoned, such as money is not important, status and show is not important, but instead to have love for one another is very important. I can make choices towards these values and live only to work towards these values.  
  
Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         No     

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No     

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     the experience was one and all - unity.  
  
During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         No       

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I knew that I was dead and yet my soul was still existing free from its body. I don't know what happens after that but for me bodily death is not the end.  
  
Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes 
  
What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Moderate changes in my life       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes Although I was before a very social person, I now feel very isolated and alone.    At the moment, nearly all my contacts with others seem empty and senseless and I'm very much a seeker.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No     

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.    

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     Sometimes I know things that I shouldn't know yet and they later prove to be true.  

  I know when someone is mailing me and that evening, I will find a message written at the moment I had felt it earlier.   

  I know when an article is written about someone in a magazine and the following day I'll get that magazine in the mail box with the article in it.  

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          The love that I was allowed to experience.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It was months after my accident that I understood what had happened to me. then at that time I told a few people. I did not get the feeling that anyone understood me.  

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   I suspect that I saw reports on TV when I was young about the  tunnel, light, and contact with the deceased.     This knowledge had no influence on my experience because my experience was totally different.  
  
  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     If you back to that moment and recall the experience you simply know that it was real. This simply can't be compared with earthly experiences.  
  
What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real       

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   By observing birds, I felt an intense love and connection, which felt much too intense to be felt in this life. Tears would run over my cheeks.  
  
Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         No  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Maybe a question about how the adjustment afterwards is going, are you still confused? Have you sought help? Which help?
