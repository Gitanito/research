  		              		Experience Description   

    At the age of 8, I arrived in Australia from Italy. I was already unwell with a hernia. Sometime after arrival I had emergency surgery.  At now almost 60 years of age, I can still recall the sheer fear of falling backwards into what felt like pitch black tunnel of jelly, unable to stop the fall. Next thing, I was on the roof of the operating room looking down on the table with my body, a Nun and medical staff surrounding it. I was not scared; I could see the homes and traffic outside as if the hospital walls did not exist. The next thing I remember is being in an elevator and going back to a ward. Nobody like the family or hospital staff believed my story. The experience has stayed with me all of my life and is as clear as day.
