  		              		Experience Description   

    This has bothered me all my life:   

  I was about 4 years old.  My father, mother, older sister, and I were at Alum Rock Park in San Jose. We were playing at a very large, indoor plunge with a slide. My sister wanted to have daddy take her down the slide. Father told mom to watch me. I wandered to the side of the pool and it was very crowded with kids. Kids in pool told me to jump in and they would help me swim. I jumped in and went to the bottom and the deep end of the pool. Looking up, I could see arms and legs of the kids in pool. 

  As I sank, I felt warm and comfortable, like being wrapped in a soft warm blanket. Then I was up in the rafters of the building looking down.  I don't remember having a physical body. There was a warm something behind me that spoke into my head, 'You have to go back.' I tried to turn and see what or who was there but I couldn't turn to see. 

  Next thing I woke up at side of pool, vomiting and getting my breath back.  

  It took me until I was in my 40's to ask my mom what happened.  Then I realized that I drowned and was able to come back to my body. I felt very comfortable and happy up in those rafters and did not want to go back but followed the voice in my head.
