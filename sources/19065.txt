she&#39;s asking if there&#39;s a particular ET
civilization that&#39;s identified itself to
our group the answer is not one
particular but a number a number of
different species and my unders our
purpose of our group is interstellar
diplomacy and bringing all of them
together see so what we would want to
avoid is a bilateral and unilateral but
bilateral or bipolar cosmos and you want
it to be multilateral and you want it to
be all civilizations if they&#39;re capable
of reaching this planet and in fact are
here or nearer or in our solar system or
have that capability we would want to
have humans who are on a team who are
interested in dialogue peace and what I
call universal peace I mean world pieces
it&#39;s like the Treaty of you know the
League of Nations
is way too late for just world peace we
have to go unfortunately
straight to universal peace so it
doesn&#39;t do any good if you have world
peace but the world is united against
fighting one or more et civilizations
that&#39;s not going forward that&#39;s going to
oblivion so Hollywood notwithstanding
and the latest Tom Cruise movie
notwithstanding you you really cannot
enter this subject if you&#39;re serious
about having a future at all without
having a multilateral approach and so we
have had very specific contact
experience with different types of
species and what-have-you and but my
view is that over the years it&#39;s many
different ones different appearances
Heights shapes the whole bit
even in some of the photographs we have
but the the the point I make the people
is that doesn&#39;t really matter that&#39;s
external appearance it&#39;s the fact that
they&#39;re all conscious sentient and that
what we want to move to is a time of
universal peace that involves all these
civilizations because you know you
cannot go into if we&#39;re gonna leave the
sort of the last era behind the era of
division infighting and warfare which
has been the primary organizing
principle of this planet for the last
few thousand years both financially and
institutionally has been war still is
it&#39;s still the biggest industry now it&#39;s
trillions if you&#39;re gonna move past that
and certainly if you&#39;re gonna move into
space you have to move into it with a
new consciousness as Einstein said no
problems ever been solved by the
consciousness that created it and so the
consciousness of us versus them and
picking and choosing of this and that so
from the very beginning what I found is
that we were having experiences with
very different types of civilizations
and species all shapes sizes everything
and it&#39;s really beautiful and I think
that&#39;s how that&#39;s by design
the the philosophy or the ethical
underpinnings of what we&#39;re doing it&#39;s
based on doing exactly that
that&#39;s right
it&#39;s pretty much after the release it
kind of just stayed there so military
and as well this choice as to what is
the real obstacle from utilizing those
again
we&#39;re talking about free energy six
billion dollars is really not that much
money I agree with you
yeah he&#39;s asking the question with the
numbers of people who have been
interested and looked into these these
issues why hasn&#39;t the amount been raised
to create this sort of initial to your
lab research project and you know you
have to ask those people I know them I
can tell you what they&#39;ve told me the
people who are associated with
governments and contracting they don&#39;t
want to touch it because they&#39;re afraid
there are some high net worth people
I&#39;ve approached and I&#39;ll just give you
one example I can give you this example
you know my wife knew the D Khoury
details of this and so did my whole
group and this is somebody who live in
Virginia not far from me but whose
family were industrialists and there
they had about a seven hundred and fifty
million dollar a year income and you
know five private jets and X had used
them some some of these planes to go to
some sensitive meetings and so I
approached the sort of the scion the
elder of this family really controlled
the operation and I explained to him how
we&#39;re running out of time to get this
dealt with and would he do this and help
because basically the amount of money he
blows out of the tail of his Gulfstream
jet would do it and he said well I&#39;ll
tell you why
it&#39;s too dangerous and I&#39;m not gonna
risk my children and grandchildren who
fly around on my planes to do this I
said well if I&#39;m doing it why are you at
risk and he told me a very interesting
story that back in the late 1960s he
knew an executive with General Motors
who was telling him about the zero point
type energy systems they had and some of
the classified research at General
Motors and that he felt it was time for
that to come out so that every car
coming off the assembly line was
basically an electric free energy car
didn&#39;t have to be plugged in and way
past a Tesla there&#39;s I thinking 60
and he said that two weeks later after
he had was openly talking about this
this executive was found dead and it
looked like a suicide but this
industrialist that I knew very well told
me that everyone knew it was not a
suicide and so I found that you know
Pete the fear is the mind killer so you
know there are a lot of people who who
know about this but they don&#39;t want to
stick their necks out the public by and
large just wants to be entertained by it
you know I would say that if you know
you can launch an app of you know kitty
cats playing piano x&#39; and probably pull
in ten million dollars in a month or
something you know what is a candy crush
or you know some of these idiotic apps
and video games but I have not found
that the public the public is always no
offense doing what you&#39;re doing and that
is why doesn&#39;t someone else fund this so
it&#39;s a little Elliott like the Little
Red Hen phenomenon where you know the
lure at Hankook won&#39;t you know everyone
wants to eat the cake or bread it but no
one wants to help cook it and so
everyone&#39;s looking for someone else to
do it
it&#39;s like someone being stabbed on the
street of New York and everyone watching
and no one wants to intervene because
the people who are high enough in in
industry and finance know that you&#39;re
stepping on some big toes if you move
into this and the masses for the most
part mainly want to be entertained by
this subject it&#39;s just sort of a
fascinating conspiracy theory sort of
thing and so but you know and so that&#39;s
been the problem the masses haven&#39;t put
in the funds as sort of a that the movie
was crowd funded but you know moving
that from a few hundred thousand to a
few million didn&#39;t happen and then the
very wealthy people for the most part
are really afraid of touching this third
rail boom zap but you know if you know
someone who&#39;s got the curve it&#39;s all
about courage and whether it&#39;s going out
and making contact or me
you know having the courage to explore
your own capabilities in consciousness
or doing this it&#39;s all about the courage
we manifest and a lot of times you find
that people who are quite wealthy and
comfortable do not want to step into
something where they could be greatly in
harm&#39;s way and so that fear kind of
creates its own containment now my own
view of it is that I think it&#39;s an
unfounded fear I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s a
zero risk I just think that it&#39;s mostly
psychological at this point and besides
I tell people I&#39;m the canary in the mine
shaft so as long as I&#39;m still twittering
away you shouldn&#39;t have too much to
worry about but you know I there have
been a number of people I mean a few
dozen when I say a few dozen people who
have net worth north of hundreds of
millions to billions that I&#39;ve met with
that they do not want to step into this
and what would be easier is to find
probably 10 or 12 people of more
moderate worth who would each put in
500,000 or something but that it hasn&#39;t
happened either so we&#39;ll see I mean I
always say is that you know when they
when people when when there&#39;s a critical
mass of awareness and I keep doing
everything I can as a single individual
then it&#39;ll happen and if not then it
won&#39;t happen and we&#39;ll get the
consequences of that and then it&#39;ll
happen in the aftermath at the Phoenix I
call it the fina picking all up from the
ashes so it&#39;s not a there&#39;s no question
of my main mind it will happen at some
point but will it be soon enough and can
we avoid a lot of huge problems I mean
imagine if we had not needed Mideast oil
50 60 70 years ago where we would not
have had the hegemony in the presence in
the Middle East that have led to the
mess we&#39;re in now never mind
the biosphere being damaged and the
pollution and cancer rates skyrocketing
and
but you know again there was a fear of
taking on the macroeconomics status quo
and the macroeconomics status quo I mean
it&#39;s like what would the minister of
defense of Canada Paul Hellyer and I
were talking about this I I was at his
home he says that he was a macroeconomic
person to start with and he said
basically that&#39;s the big problem is that
this is not something that&#39;s just like
creating another computer system or it&#39;s
it&#39;s bringing out a whole paradigm of
science technology that would change the
entire petrodollar system in the whole
macroeconomic order and with it the
commodities markets and hundreds of
trillions of dollars of wealth that
somebody owns that&#39;s sitting in the
ground in the form of uranium and oil
and coal and what-have-you
plus all the generating capacity it goes
with it so it&#39;s such a huge change that
most people don&#39;t want to entertain
doing it and I&#39;ve you know talk to
people goldman sachs about this and they
said oh yeah you&#39;re talking about
basically wiping out 600 trillion
dollars in assets so trillion so you
know in the whole u.s. federal
government including Social Security and
all the entitlements is three and a half
trillion so this is it&#39;s it the longer
we put it off the more the world is
depending on the old paradigm and the
more cannibalizes and destroys itself
however and it becomes more and more
difficult to do it so it&#39;s kind of like
putting off repairing a leak in your
roof of your house you can put it off
and eventually the damn thing is gonna
cave in on your head but all I can do
you know I don&#39;t have the resources to
do it and is articulate what could be
done hope there are some people who
gather around the vision and and we get
it done in enough time you know you have
to understand when I started this in my
I guess I was in my mid 30s and 1990
when I started all this and my I thought
well
if I put the information together and
provided it on a silver platter tied up
in a bow to the right people they do the
right thing wrong so I got disabused of
that notion very quickly but you know so
ultimately that&#39;s why we then said well
disclosure of this information the
contact effort I never viewed the
government doing that initial I always
saw that as a citizen&#39;s diplomacy but
then also the technology I realized
would have to be coming from We the
People so it&#39;s about organizing We the
People and so I tell everyone who&#39;s
listening to this share this information
with the right people in your network
send them to our site and through
networking maybe the right folks will
line up who have the courage to step
forward and make it a reality
or somebody with one of these
technologies who has one that&#39;s already
operational will step forward and be
willing to do something strategically
sane because the strategically insane
thing to do is to do what Stan Meyer did
and Rossi is doing and almost every
other inventor I know had done which
resulted in a catastrophe so all I can
do is encourage and and you know but I
do think you know it&#39;s all networking
you know it&#39;s like networking it out
there the way that I&#39;ve you know we&#39;ve
reached the people we&#39;ve reached is
through networking so that&#39;s really a
key thing to do
you
