  		              		Experience Description   

    My NDE occurred when I crashed a party of teenagers older than myself. I was age 14 and naive of such parties.  I knew about the party because my older sister was going to be there.   I wanted to know what older teenagers did at such parties.  As soon as I arrived at the party, it was already crowded. In the hallway entrance to a small apartment, I saw the kitchen. On top of the stove, there was a group of big, steaming soup pots and several large, black garbage bags lying on the counters.  A young man who I did not know, asked me if I wanted some kool-Aid.   Literally,  I thought I was being offered a glass of kool-Aid,  so I said, 'Yes.'  The young man took one of the pots from the stove,  looked down into the pot as he said, 'ut oh, the dregs.'   I had no idea what he was talking about,  but the crowd around laughed.
  
  The dregs are the heavier sediment the settled to the bottom of the pot. He poured the dregs into a large glass. He then poured  red liquid into the glass, stirred it and handed it to me.  I took a several large gulps because I was thirsty.  It had a bitter taste.  I told them it needed more sugar and they laughed again.  Within a minute of drinking the kool-Aid,  I started to feel weird and dizzy.  I went to a nearby couch to sit down.  Almost immediately, I began to hallucinate.  I had no idea what was happening to me since I had never done drugs before. I had no idea at the time that I had been drugged.  
  
  I became extremely frightened when the shag carpet turned into squirming worms and the walls moved in and out with the music in a claustrophobic way.   The other people at the party knew something was wrong with me but made no effort to help me.  I knew I had to get away from these awful people.
  
  I was so scared that I ran out of the apartment and into the street.  All I knew was that I had to make it home.  Trying to make my way home on foot, I had to cross several busy streets.  I don’t know how I made it across those streets without being hit by a car,  but somehow I found my way home.  I entered the house through the back door and tried to be quiet since I because I wasn’t supposed to be out or at that party. I  climbed the steps to my bedroom and then fell onto my bed.  
  
  The hallucinations became much worse.  I began to hallucinate that my fingers were melting and that my bones were shrinking.  It was extremely,  bone-aching painful.  I knew I was dying.  The hard part was giving up my body.  I held on  a long time since I was afraid to give up. I knew that if I could lose my body, the pain would go away.     The pain  was so unbearable, I gave it up and let go.  
  
  As soon as I let go, I floated   upwards and out of my body. The pain went away.  It was dark all around but I could see my body lying dead on the bed. As I floated upwards,  I could see members of my family in various other parts of our house doing certain things. I was relieved to see them.  As I floated higher and higher I could see the house and neighborhood from a birds-eye view. The sides of my awareness  was PITCH BLACK, cold darkness.  As I rose higher I saw or felt dark misty entities floating in that darkness with me.  Some entitites were in human, whispy shapes but many were animal shapes, like dogs and cats.  Some where flying by swiftly, and some were just floating like they were stuck in the darkness.
  
  It became so dark I could no longer see my neighborhood or house.  This scared me. It felt like I was rising into another layer of darkness.  BUT I was extremely conscious in my MIND.  I was afraid of this darkness and wanted to find a way out.  It seemed like a forever-darkness.  
  
  Finally, I saw a TINY pin prick of bright LIGHT in the darkness.  I KNEW I had to go toward that tiny light.  As I  floated  toward the light, I saw recognizable events in my life from the past. As I got closer to this tiny light, I  saw things that I felt were future events  but was confused because I did not recognize the events.   
  
  As I moved closer and closer to the light it became a tunnel.  At first it was dark, then it got lighter and then was light. I felt heat.  At one point the light heat became so intense I was afraid.   I thought, 'It’s a good thing that I no longer have a body - because a body could not withstand the intensity of this light and heat.  At that point, I became overjoyed because I realized my mind was ALERT and conscious of EVERYTHING.  This thought of KNOWING EVERYTHING pervaded as I moved through the tunnel of light. I came closer and closer upon the grand all-encompassing LIGHT of GOD.  I felt PURE LOVE as God embraced me in light.  I also felt scared of the knowledge and power that I felt surrounding me.  Then I heard a voice tell me, 'It is not your time, you are to be sent back.'  And then I was suddenly let go. 

   I came into my body again in a flash of SHOCK.  I was wide awake and breathless in astonishment of what I had experienced.    I immediately felt  sadness because I already missed the feeling of being embraced by GOD's pure love.  I was also dumbfounded in how to act in my body again.  It felt like I had to get used to it all over again.  I remember thinking about how shocking it is to be born as a baby  body. At least they could grow into a body over time, but to be shot down into a body suddenly is an overwhelming SHOCK. Even though I knew it was my body, it felt new and foreign to me.  
  
  Not to mention the effects of being unknowingly overdosed by accident by a group of stupid teenagers who knew I was naive but tricked me anyway. Theygave me NO HELP.  From that day forward I avoided anyone in that group.  

  It took me over 6 months to begin to get used to my body again.  It took years to finally read about and understand that there were others like me with who experienced an NDE.  When I first came across an account of NDE stories,  I was not surprised to learn that many have similar experiences

In fact at the age of 6 (on  the 1st day of 1st grade), my parents sat me down to try to explain what religion was.  They told me they did believe in God but they did not practice a religious faith and that choosing a belief/ faith was totally up to me. They encouraged that  if I wished I could explore religion on my own through friends I was about to meet in first grade, explaining to me that many i would meet in school would probably have the religious faith of their parents / or go to church on Sunday with their parents.
