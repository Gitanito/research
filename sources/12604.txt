    I had studied NDEs and also A Course in Miracles, so I know there is no death. 

My experience happened six months ago during surgery. I have diabetes and hand an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. 
  
  Everything went dim while my vision and speech were  blurring. I didn’t panic, but  I gave up struggling and was calm. The only thought I had was of my younger son  as he is extremely attached to me.

  Suddenly, I was in a huge, cloudy gray tunnel.

 There was a woman sitting on a table and three other persons. I recognized them as overworked souls who were receiving covid 19 patients who had passed to the other side. As I met each one of them we embraced each other.  They were so happy while exclaiming thanks that I was back with them. I had forgotten all my worries and was so happy. I remember that with these soul beings, I had some serious misunderstandings on earth, but now all was understood as we laughed it off as trivial. 

Then my sister, who is currently living in California, turn up on a scooter
