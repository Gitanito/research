There was so much white light everywhere.  The light emanated from every point, strong but did not hurt. So much joy, it was almost uncontrollable, and I didn't want to return to my body which I knew was in a lot of pain. Then something insisted that I must go back and I began to feel the pain from my feet up. I forgot the whole experience until one day several years later I remembered the event. I knew then that my mother had made a vow, a prayer, a sacrifice in exchange for my life.
