  		              		Experience Description:   

  					  According to the ambulance driver, I was de-fibrillated three times before my heart started beating again. About three minutes elapsed. During this time, I walked through our maintenance shop. As I went into the last shop, I turned and stared at the rear wall. The whole wall and everything around me was a soft brilliant light. I felt someone was there but I never saw or heard anyone speak.

As soon as I woke up, I felt the most peaceful that I had ever felt, then I thought of my dead father. At that time, the pain returned. I don't remember much until the next day.

I think about the experience every day. Now, I'm not afraid of death.

Glen.
