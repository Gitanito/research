I remember flying around my house and being amazed at how close I could get to the floor without landing. It was as if I was able to become incredibly small and fly through the fibers of the carpet. I specifically remember the feeling of learning how to soar and how exhilarating it was. I flew around my house and the nice lady laughed at my amazement. Sometimes, I think that my brother who died the same day he was born was with me too, but I may have imagined that. 

I woke up on the floor next to the bunk bed, which my sister and I shared. I remember looking forward to bedtime after that and hoping that I would be able to fly again in my dreams.
