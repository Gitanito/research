  		              		Experience Description   

  As a child, my family and I lived in   government-assisted housing.  I shared a room with my younger brother. At the time, I was very ill and had chronic asthma.   One night, I was gasping for breath and the next  nanosecond, I was looking down at our room from the corner of the ceiling.  I was not full size, but  was a speck  while  looking down on the room, a bit like through fish-eye lens today. I was aware that I had a choice of stay where I was or go back. I hesitated because it was very peaceful in the corner of the room. I chose to go back. I was  whooooosh back into my body. I was back looking out of my own eyes.

 I laid awake for some time wondering if my experience  was real or a dream. It may have been a dream but it was so real and so vivid that I have never felt it was.
  
  Since then, I felt very empowered. I qualified as a UK lawyer was very successful and became known for winning every case. I always knew what to look for or where to look.  There are multiple documentaries about my cases and I have been featured in several biographies from the people  I have helped.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Neither pleasant NOR distressing  

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I looked down at myself. I might have been  dead and my brother was sleeping.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I didn't feel ill or tired. I was  amazed at being high in the upper corner of the room. I wasn't scared, yet I knew I was there. It felt  a bit like just enjoying the ride.  

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         Yes, totally alert.  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual

When analyzing in my mind, I can convince myself that I must have seen something prior to the event I am experiencing.    

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   I have described it. I knew I had to stay or go and maybe the time to choose was short. There was one conversation, like  an awareness,  when I realized that I had to make a choice. I made the choice to go back.
