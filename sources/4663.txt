liveth and converseth phoye the Jicavens:—How many
privileges and advantages hath Goo bestowed upon
you: you range above the Heavens by contemplation,
and conceives the motion and magnitude of the Stars.:
you talk with Angels, and even with Goo himself;
you hate all Creatures within your dominion, and keep
the Devils in subjection. Your capacity for ac­
quiring knowledge is unlimited by your Maker ; and
the blessedness of an enlightened mind w ill bring you

deface your nature, nor make yourself unworthy of

INTRODUCTION.
J^ C C O R D I J C G to the concurrent doctrine o f ancient and
eminent Philosophers, it appears, a Life is infused throughout
all things, an intellectual and artificial fire, an inward prin­
ciple, animal spirit, or natural life, producing and forming
"within, as art doth without, regulating, moderating, and-
reconciling the various motions and qualities of this mundpn#
system. B y virtue o f this Life, the great masses are held to*
gether in their orderly courses, as well as the minutest parti*
cies governed in their natural motions, according to the se*
veral laws of attraction dr gravity with which every parties!
o f matter is endowed. Hence it may be supposed agreabiy
to the configuration and respective temperament of the hea*
venly bodies, together with the various configurations or as*
pects, and influences the one upon the other, and of course
upon the. individual that is born $ for in proportion as these re­
spectively operate together, will be the bent and inclination o f
the person who is born under such and such position o f the
celestial Stars. I f their aspects or positions are favourable,
and benevolent planets are above the Horizon, much good
will certainly ensue to tbe.Native. If evil configurations, and'
the benevolent planets are under the Earth and evilly posited,
much anxiety and sorrow will enevitably ensue. This, long
experience daily manifests to the levels of this science-y

and that the Native Wiff bfe dbfe hy t*h£ apparent strength of
the Stars at hk birth to achieve the most stupendous actiont#
Oh the Contrary, i f the positions o f Cite principal Planets are
weak, he will naturally be unfortunate, supine, and quite in*
active. This is most wonderfully and clearly perceived in
all Men's nativities, as well a* their inclinations to vicious or
virtuous persurls. By directions, thb time o f marriage, for­
tune, death, lire, k most accurately know n; arid if the

t great certainty in it.—

*
1fhesd and the twelve Jibes that follow in the next pagb
are very sublime, in Pope’s Essay on Man.
Astrology then, I consider as the effects derived from the
amazing psowers of mutual attraction of the different parts
and masses (great or small) of matter, the one upon the
other 5 wbich knowledge k to be attained by study and obser­
vation o f the influences produced by the motions of the hea-
enly bodies ; for as Astfoftoftty hath its origin in the motion
dud revolution of the Stars, so Astrology is founded on the ef­
fects and influences of attraction or gravitation in the same bo­
dies, observed from the nativities o f different persons : and
should any deny the situation of the Stars, as they are set down
byouF skilful Astronomers, he must be sent to their most ac­
curate astronomical tables, founded on the best mathematical
principles > so he who denies the influences of Astrology
must be referred for conviction; to the predictions verified in
the genitures of different persons, and observe how beauti­
fully the actions and accidents of various persons agree with
the Horoscope and correspond with the Astrologer’s predic­
tions.. Human nature is subject to error $ s6 that no sconce
can bo deeined absolutely perfects—only according to thk
Digi G ^le
coarse of nature, G od permitting, such accidents will be«
fal the Native at such a time, saith the Artist. Astrology can-
not be repugnant to the Christian religion, unless it be a sin to
study Nature or Astronomy r on the contrary, it has a tenden-
cy to elevate the mind to the contemplation of G od the Fa -
I'm es of all.— It may be, as our treatise mentions, attended
with real service to lead eveiy individual to know future events
— fore*warned, fore-armed. For a yerson to know the leading
features or dispositions in his nature, by means of the confi­
gurations of the Stars at the hour of birth, especially if those
features or aspects predict an evil tendency,..must be of the
greatest consequence to the individual concerned) namely
that he may thereby* when he is arrived to years of maturi­
ty, (and, let us hope of discretion also,) make use of his rea­
son and better judgement, as a correcter of the natural prone-
fiess to vice, which he sees predominant in his constitution.!

Astrology is the most ancient of all human sciences: Jose-'
pbus reports, tjiat the Antediluvians were well acquainted*
with it, and engraved the rudiments thereof upon permanent
pillars o f stotie to preserve them to posterity from the floods
which by this art they probably foresaw. These pillars en -
dured through many generations and were not entirely efface
ed till some time after the deluge.
After the flood, the Assyrians were the first People we read’
o f that devoted themselves to the study of this Science 5 soon'
followed by the Chaldeans, Egyptian*and Arabians; w ho1
blessed with ingenuity, and a pure; serene atmosphere, seemed*
mvited thereunto by nature, and* by continued observations andr
experience, brought it tb such a degree o f estimation that
lone but those who obtained any proficiency therein; were ad­
mitted to the administration o f sacred rites; or to the man-*
igement o f the affairs of state. »
After these, the Indians and Greeks found rtew beauties,
in these Siderial Studies; and lastly, the Europeans borrowed1
their knowledge from the Greeks and*Orientkk; who are still'
Jovers of this science, even to enthusiasm..
W e will just speak here a little of the utility of it* It d l-

rects persons, in a .natural way, how they may most fortu­
nately manage their affairs the World y as by elections, to
chuse a fit time to begin any considerable enterprise ; by di­
rections of the Planets in their nativities, arid annual revolu­
tions, to discover the most dangerous or propitious times that
are approaching to any Native. In Horary Questions, full
satisfaction may be given, if managed by a skilful Artist.
Astrology also is of various other tfses, which my limits will
not permit me to mention, before 1 proceed to the Argolian
and Ptolomean method of teaching, which is the easiest, most
simple and instructive, of any in the W orld, we must pre-
mise a very particular and authentic story, concerning the
celebrated Dryden.
. When his Lady (for he had married Lady Elizabeth How*,
ard, Sister to the Earl o f Berkshire) was in labour with hit
Son Charles, being told it was decent to withdraw, he laid
his watch on the table, and begged one of the Ladies then
present, in a most solemn manner to take notice exactly o f
the very minute the Child was born 7 which she did, and ae*
quainted the Father accordingly: about a week after, when
the Lady was pretty well recovered, Dryden took ati occasion
of telling her, tha’t he had been calculating the Child’s nati­
vity, and observed with grief, that he was bora in an evil
hour; Jupiter, Venus and the Sun, said he, are all under the
Earth; and the Lord of his Ascendent afflicted with a dire­
ful square of Mars and Saturn. I f he lives to the 8th year
©f his Age, he will go near to die a violent death on his birth­
day> but should he escape, I see but small hopes: he will
be under the same direction in his.23rd year; and should he
escape that also, the 33rd or 3*th year is, I fear— ♦ Here he
was interrupted by the violent anguish of his Lady, who,
could no longer hear the calaijmies he was fortelling of her
Digitized by Google
INTRODUCTION I S
The time predicted was now come : The Lady s anxiety
was so great, that it occasioned such an effervescence in her
Blood and spirits, as threw her into such' a violent fever^
that her life Was despaired o f $ until a letter came from her
Husband, reproving her womanish credulity, and assuring
fier that her Child was welt. This recovered her health and
spirits; and in six weeks after, she received an eclairicisemen*
of the whole affair; for Dryden either through fear of being
reckoned superstition or thinking Aftrologr a science be*
heath his study, was extremely cautiow to let any body
know Be was a*dabbler in that way j fer which reason he could
not excuse his own absence on Ms Son’s anniversary, from ar
general hunting*maCch which Lord Berkshire made, and to
which all the neighbouring Gentlemen were invited: but be­
fore he went, he took care to set ftis'Son a double exercise in*
fee Latin tongue, (as he taught his Children himself.) with*
a strict charge not to stir out .of the Room until his return jf
well knowing the task he had set him would take him u p
longer tim e. A s Charles was performing; his duty in obedi­
ence to his Father, the Stag made towards the House, and the*
hoisc alarmlngthe Servants, one of them took young Dryden*
by the hand, in order to see the sport. Just as they came to
the gate, the Stag, being at bay with the dogs, leaped over
the court*wall, which was very low as well’ as very old, and!
fee dogs following, threw down a part of this wall, ten yards-
» length, under which Charles Dryden lay buried. He was*
hmnediately dug out, and after six weeks languishing in a-
dangerous way, he recovered r so far Drydea’s prediction
was fulfilled. In the 23rd year, Charles felt from the top ot
•n old Tow er, belonging to the Vatican at Rome, occassioned
by a swiming ki his head, with which he was seized, the he&fc
of the day being excessive* He again recovered ; but was

^rer after in a languishing sickly state. In the 3 3 rd year o f
his age, he was drowned at Windsor, having with another
Gentlemen swam over the Tham es; but in returning a third
time it was supposed he yra* taken with the cramp, as he call^
ed out, though too late for help. Thus the Father's prediction1
was amply fulfilled, and will serve to illustrate the truth o f
Astrology. Not only many passages might be quoted from;
the Holy Scriptures, as a sufficient confirmation of it #> every;
dispassionate reader, but there are also some very extraordi­
nary instances of this predictive faculty recorded by different
Historians of character and eminence. For instance: Thw
Archbishop of Pisa consulted several different professors o f
Astrology concerning his destiny, and they all calculated h i*
nativity atdifferent times, and without any communication with?
one another; but they all foretold him he would be hanged*
I|: seemed highly incredible at the time, because be was in?
*p much honor and power; but the. event justified the predica­
tions, for in the sedition of Pope Sextus IVth, in the sudden
tagaand uproar of the People he was seized and hanged Pet-
xus Leontius, g celebrated Physician and Astrologer, of Spole*?
tanura, cast his own' Nativity, and foretold that his death
Vpuld be occasioned by water, and many years afterwards bq
was found drowned in a pond, into which bp had fallen tho
preceeding night, by mistaking his way. Josephus tells u»
he cast the .nativities of Vespasian and his Son Titus, and
predicted that they would both be Emperors $ ?nd so it turn-
qd out. I could adduce a great variety of facts, equally as
extraordinary, wherein the time of death has been ascertainedf.
but let this suffice.
Tally, the great Roman Orator, was versed in this science $
so was Solomon undoubtedly conversant in it, having affiniftr

study beneath their most profound attention< but, on the con­

son in the way that they should go 5 and our Saviour in his
parables descends to the lifeless emblems of seed sown, of the
fig-tree and o f a single grain o f mustard seed, to enlighten
the understanding of Mankind. Is it not then the duty o f
every rational creature to improve by this divine example, and
to increase their imperfect knowledge in the subjects of crea­
tion ?
Such knowledge as this lies open even to the way-faring m an:
it grows in every field, and meets us in all our paths; and is
requisite to be understood by the reader before any progres­
sion be made in that excellent p?rt of Astrology calif d Ele­
mentary Philosophy. I shall now conclude these observations
and begin with arranging the Signs of the Zociac under all
their different qualities and forms.

The Zodiac is a great circle of the Sphere, and is divided
into 360 degrees^ ever} degred is subdivided into f>0 other di^.
Visions, called minutes, and every minute into (X) seconds)
every Sign contains 30 of those degrees, and so the 12 Signs

<f A Conjunction is improperly called an Aspect, because
Hi* when two Planets are both in the same degree and mi­
nute of a Sign, and are said to be in conjunction, consequent­
ly cannot at that time be in aspect to each other. The effects
of Conjunctions are either good or bad, according as the Da-
nets are friends or enemies to each other, or to the subject
then under consideration.
3|c A Sextile Aspect, implies two of the 1eavenly bodies po­
sited, at the distance of s xty aeg ees in longitude, or one
sixth pan of the Zodiac from each other. rIhe Sextile, it
fcrmed an aspect of imperfect love, or friendship $ because
whto t .o Tlanets, or Signifirators, are in'Sextile to each
other, th y import that uiy matter in dispute, treaty of mar­
riage, or any other subject of inquiry, may be happily ter-

initiated, or brought about by the means of Friends $ or that
for want thereof the tontrary may happen; it is generally
considered an omen of the favourable kind.
By a n Quartile aspect, two Planets are understood to be
posited . t ninety.degrees, or one fourth part of the circle of
the Zodiac from each other. The Quartile is considered an
Aspect of imperfect hatred; and acts vice vefsa with the Sex*
tile, inclining rather to contention and misfortune, as the
other does to friendship, harmony and good fortune.
& A Trine Aspect, imports the Planets to be situated at
the distance of one hundred and twenty degrees, or one third
part of the circle of the Zodiac, from each other. ,This is an
Aspect of the most perfect unanimity, friendship and peace $
and it is so considered, because when the Planets are in a &
Aspect, they are posited in Signs precisely of the same tripli-
city and nature; that is to say, they are both in an earthy,
.airy, fiery or watery Sign ; and consequently both contribute
their mutual influences. But in a which is an Aspect
of imperfect amity, the Planets are posited in Signs of only a
pariile nature, viz. fiery and airy, or an earthy with a watery
Sign j and as the fiery Sign is hot and dry, and the airy, hot
and moist, the earthy, cold and dry, and the watery, cold
and moist, so the Planets thus posited', agreeing only in one
point out of two, give but an imperfect influence.
g The Opposition of two Planets, signifies their being po­
sited at one hundred and eighty degrees, or just half the dis­
tance of the Zodiac apart, which places them diametrically
opposite to each other in the Heavens. * This is considered an
Aspect of perfect hatred, or of inveterate malice and enmity,
as malignant iu its effect as the Trine is benevolent; and o f

double the destructive tendency, o f the □ Aspect, therefore
an # is justly termed an Aspect ol perfect enmity.
These aspects are all divided into partile and platick aspect*
A partile Aspect considers two Planets, exactly so many de­
grees from each other as make a perfect Aspect; that is if
Venus be in 12 degrees of Cancer, and Jupiter in 12 degree*
of Virgo, they are in partile sextile Aspect. Again if the Sun
be in two degrees of Leo, and the Moon in two degrees of
Libra, they are in a partile sextile aspect also; so that all per­
fect Aspects are partile; and imply the matter or thing threat­
ened, whether good or evil,, to be near at hand.
By a platic Aspect we are to understand two Planets s#
posited as to admit half the degrees of each of their.own rays
or orbs; for instance if Saturn be posited in 20 degrees o f
Libra, and Jupiter in 28 degrees of Sagittarius, then Saturn
would be in a platic sextile Aspect to Jupiter,, because Sa­
turn would be situated within the moiety of both* their orba
added together, which is seen by the following table. the
same circumstance applies to the Aspects of all the Planets;
or if their distance from each other brings them within one-
half o f each of their orbs or radiations, when added toge­
ther, they will then form a platic Aspect.
It must be dbserved in these Aspects, whether the co op­
eration o f the two Planets is going off or coming on. In
the above example, the effect o f Satums platic sextile A s­
pect, with Jnpiter was going off, Jupiter having seperated
from the sextile of Saturn 8 degrees, but if we reverse their
situations and place Saturn in 28 degrees of Sagittarius and
Jupiter in 23 degrees of Libra, then Jupiter the lighter

Thus, Cancer and Leo have assigned unto them the twe
great Luminaries, Sol and Luna; because they are agreeable
to each other in nature; for th$ Sun bring naturally hot and
dry, shews his effects in a more eminent manner when posit­
ed in Leo, than he doth in either Aries or Sagittarius; and
the M oon, for the same reason, hath Cancer allotted for her
government, because she is cold and moist, and of the na<-
ture of this Sign $ and being the first o f the watery triplicity,
and next to. the Sun’s House, she receives her light from
him •, and all things are generated by their joint influence.
Saturn is uaturally cold, and therefore an enemy to beat*

which are the opposite Signs to Leo and Cancer, and are
consequently cold and moist : Saturn is accounted the mo*t

his Houses, namely Saggittary and Pisces, which are in trine
to the Houses ol the two Luminaries; Pisces bis night House
is in nine to Cancer, the ouse of the nocturnal Luminary ;
.and Sagittary, his day House, in trine to Leo, the House of
the diurnal luminary. Jupiter being naturally temperate*
and ha ing these amicahle aspects, is considered the most be­
nevolent of ail the Planets to mankind* and the greater for­
tune.
Mars next in order follows Jupiter, being placed under
him ; and therefore those Signs that go before and afu r the
Houses of Jupiter, aie alloted to Mars, viz. Scorpio. aud

Luminaries, and form an aspect o f love and amity ; but be­
cause a sextile is-not so strong and perfect an aspect as a trine*

A ll the Planets except Sol, are sometimes on the north side
o f the Ecliptic, sometimes on the south side j but the Sun al­
ways moves in the Ecliptic, therefore can have no latitude.
N ow it must be observed that the aspects of the Planets are
projected, or cast contrary ways, either forward in a line-pro­
gressively with the Sign of the Zodiac, which are termed
Sinister Aspects $ or else backward, in a line reverse to the
order of the Zodiac, which are termed Dexter Aspects j ai

In the foregoing Table, at the top o f the third, column,
note the characters of the Aspects, sextile quartile n ,
trine A and opposition $> as placed over the Signs o f the
Zodiac. In the first, observe the words dexter and sinister,
and in the second columri, the Sign y : these are intended
to shew that a Planet posited in Aries, would send his sextile
Aspect dexter to Aquarius, and sinister to Gemini, his quartile
dexter to Capricorn, his sinister to Cancer, his trine dexter to
Sagittary, his sinister to Leo, and would b6 in opposition to a
Planet posited in equal degrees of Libra $ and so on through
the Table. It must be observed that the dexter Aspects are
more powerful than the sinister.
THE ANTISCIONS OF THE PLANETS.
A Planet's Anstiscion, is a certain virtue, it acquires by be­
ing posited in conjunction with any Star or Planet, in degrees
equally distant from the two tropical Signs 25 and V f ; in
which degrees the Sun, when it arrives, occasstons equal day
and night all over the World. For instance, when the © i*
in the 10th degree of 8 , he is as far distant from the 1st de­
gree of 25, as when in the 12th degree of & j therefore when
the O , or any Planet is posited in the 10th degree of 8 , it
sends its Anstiscion to the 20th degree of SI # that is, it gives
additional force and virtue to any Planet, at that time, in the
same degree by conjunction, or that casteth any Aspect to it.
The Planet’s Antiscions may at all times be fonnd by the
following Table.

The foregoing Table shews, that a Planet situated in 1 de­

minutes of n
jJ ; a Planet in 2 degrees 2 minutes of g , into
28 degrees 5 8 minutes of ft, and so on through the Table.
These Antiscions are considered, in the rules of Astrology,
equivalent to a sextile, or a trine, particularly if the Planets
aie of the benevolent or fortunate kind. Ihese Planets have
also their contra-Anstiscions, which are of the nature of a
qoartile or opposition. T o know where these fall, it only re­
quires to find the Antiscion, and in the opposite sign to that
will be the contra-Antiscion. For instance, suppose % in
1 degree o f T , his Antiscion will then fall in 29 degrees of
15 , and his contra-Antiscion in 29 degrees of K ; because
K , is the Sign immediately opposite to rpj where the Antis-
cion falls.

In the first column against T , you find 8 , 15, 30, under
the column of masculine degrees 5 and under the column of
feminine, you have 9 , 2 2 , which shews tint the first eight
degrees of T are masculine, and the ninth degree feminine#
from 9 to 15 are masculine, and from 15 to 22, are feminine;
and from 22 to 30 are masculine. The use of which is, that
the principal significator in a nativity be posited in the degrees
and Signs masculine, be the native male or female, it argues
that he or she shall inherit a more masculine temper and reso­
lution than ordinary: but if the signifiqator be in feminine
Signs and Degrees, the native will be more effeminate, timid#
and less robust. The same observation holds good with respect
to the other Signs and degrees, as in the Table they stand di­
rected. The fourth column points out that there are certain
degrees in each Sign, which are termed light $ and if either
of these ascend in a nativity, the native will be of a fairer
and clearer complexion than ordinary. The fifth column
shews that there are degrees termed dark or obscure; and
whenever these happen to be horiscopical in a nativity, it de-
dares the native to be of a dark and sallow complexion, and
if he should be born deformed, his deformity will be consider­
ably greater. The sixth column shews which degree of the
Zodiac are called smoky 5 and if any of these should arise
on the eastern finetcr at the time of birth, they declare the
native of a mixed complexion, neither fair nor swarthy, hut
partaking of both 5 and similar to his complexion, will be his
understanding. The seventh column shews which of the de
grees of the Zodiac are called void j and if the ascendant in

the radix of any nativity, be posited in them, it declares,
an imbecility in the judgment and understanding of the na­
tive $ and the further he enters into conversation or business,
the more obvious will this defect appear. The eighth column
I points out what degrees in each of the twelve $igns, are call­
eddeep and pitted $ and these in a nativity signify that if the
ascendant, his Lord and the Moon, be situated in any of them,
the Native will be of an hasty'and imperfect speech, incapa*
bleof expfessing his desires, or of declaring his sentiments,
andwill be always involved in vexations, litigations and dis­
putesj and like a man in a pit or snare, will want the assist­
ance of another to help him out. The ninth column distin­
guishes theazimene or deficient degrees, and if in a nativity
any one of these asscend or the Lord of the asscendant, or
! the Moon, be in any of them, the native will be crooked,
| lame, or deformed, or in some manner vitiated in the
member or part of the body that the Sign governs, in which
I *uch azimene degrees shall happen to be. This rule is so unex-
I ceptionable and invariable that it ought to be well considered in
the judgment of every nativity. . The tenth column points out
all the degrees of the twelve Signs, that are increasers of for­
tune, and the knowledge to be derived from them is, that if,
in a nativity, the cusp of the 2nd House, or Lord of the 2nd,
Jupiter, or Part o f Fortune, be in degrees augmenting, they
then becam e arguments of much wealth, and presage that the
native shall, according to his capacity or situation in life, at­
tain to greater honour, riches, or preferment.

doable through a good Telescope: it is inclined thirty degree#
to the Ecliptic, and is about twenty one thousand miles in
breadth j which is equal to its distance from Saturn on all
sides. There is reason to believe that the ring turns round
its axis, because, when it is almost edge-ways to us, it appears
somewhat thicker on one side of the Planet than on the other;
and the thickest edge has been seen on different sides at d if­
ferent times. But Saturn having no visible spots on bis body,
whereby to determine the time of his turning round his axis,
the length of hisdays and nights, and the position of his ax­
is, are wholly unknown to us. He has two degrees forty
eight minutes, north; and two. degrees forty nine minutes
south latitude. His exaltation is in twenty one degrees o f
Libra, bis detriment in Cancer and Leo, and his fall in twen­
ty one degrees of Aries. He is Retrograde one hundred and
forty days; and stationary five days before, and five days after
his retrogradation. His Qrb is nine degrees before and after
any aspect; that is, his influence begins to operate, when
either he applies, or any Planet applies to him, within nine
degrees of his perfect aspect, and his influence continues in
force until he is seperated nine degrees from the aspectpartile.

he would, fall in two hundred and ninety days, if^his projeer

Mars.
Mars is next to Jupiter, and is the first planet above the
Eauh, and Moons orbit. His distance from the Sun is com­
puted at one hundred and twenty five millions of miles; and
by travelling at the rate of forty seven thousand miles every
hour, he goes round the Sun in*six hundred and eighty six of
our days, and four hours, which is the length of his year.
His diameter is found to be four thousand four hundred and
forty four miles, which is but a fifth part so large as the
Earth, And would fall to the Sun in one hundred and twen-
* ty one days, if his projectile force was destroyed. He is of*
deep fiery red color, and by his approaching some of the fixed
Stars seems to be encompassed by a very gross atmosphere.
His mean motion is thirty one degrees twenty seven minutes
and bis swift motion from thirty two to forty four minutes.
His exaltation is in twenty eight degrees of Capricorn, his de­
triment in Libra and Taurus, and makes his fail in twenty
eight degrees of Cancer. His greatest north latitude is four
degrees thirty one minutes, and his greatest south latitude six
degrees forty seven minutes. He is retrograde eighty days and
stationary two or three days before retrogradation, and tvyo

tie. Wheli this Planet ptesides at a birth it renders a strong
well set body, of short stature, but large bones, rather lean
than fat, a brown ruddy complexion, red, sandy, flaxen or
light brown hair, sharp hazle-eyes, round face, hold'counte­
nance, active and fearless. If well diguified, the Native will
be of a courageous disposition, without fear or danger 5 haz­
arding his lifeonvali occasions; of no reason in war or con­
tention ; unwilling to submit to any superior, and will en­
deavour to triumph over his enemy, and yet prudent in the
management of his private concerns. If the Planet be ill po­
sited, and aftlicted with cross aspects, the party will then
grow up a trumpeter of his own fame and consequence,
without decency or honesty, a lover of malicious quarrels and
affrays, prone to wickedness and slaughter, and in danger of
committing murder, of robbing on the highway, of becom­
ing a thief, traitor, or incendiary j of a turbulent spirit, ob­
scene, rash, inhuman and treacherous, fearing neither God
nor man, given up to every speices of fraud, violence, cruel­
ty and oppression. If the Planet be oriental at the nativity,
the Native wili be above the middle stature, very hairy, and
of a clearer complexion. If occidental, the Native will be
short, of a more incidy complexion, a small head, with yellow
hair, and a dry constitution. He is friendly only with Venus,
and at enmity with all the other Planets. In journies he por­
tends danger of robbery, loss of life, and all the o’her perils
attendant on the traveller. His greatest revolutionary year
is two hundred and fourteen, his great year is sixty six, his
mean year is forty, his least year is fifteen.

C The Moon.
The Moon is next below Mars, being a Satalite, or attend­
ant of the Earth, and goes round it, from change to change
in twenty nine days, twelve hours, nud forty four minutes j
and round the Sun with it every year. The Moon’s diameter
is two thousand, one hundred and eighty miles, and her di»t*
ance from the Earth’s centre is two hundred and forty thou1
*
sand miles, and would fall to the Sun in sixty four days, ten
hours $ and to the Earth in four days and twenty one hours,
if her projectile force was destroyed. She goes round her
orbit in twenty seven days, seven hours and forty three mi­
nutes, moving about two thousand, two hundred and ninety
miles every hour $ and turns round her axis exactly in the
time that she goes round the Earth, which is the reason of
her always keeping the same side towards us. and that her day
iind night taken together, is as long as our lunar month. She
is an opaque Globe, like the Earth, and Shines only by reflect*
ing the light of the Sun j therefore whilst that half of her
which is towards the Sun is enlightened, the other part must
be dark and invissible, and consequently she disappears when
she comes between us and the Sun j because her dark side is
then towards us. When she is gone a little way forward, we
see a little of her enlightened side, which still increases to our
view as she advances forward, until she comes to be opposite
the Sun, and then her whole enlightened side is towards ths
Earth, and she appears with around illumined orb, which we
cafi the Full-Muom 5 her dark side being then turned away
from the Earth. From the Full she^eems to decrease gra­

next change, or conjanotion with the Sup, and then she d is ­
appears as before. Her m»an motion is thineen degrees, ten
minutes, and thirty six seconds ; her swift or diurnal motion
oftenvaries, but never exceeds fif teen degrees two m!nuies, in
twentyfour hours. Her greatest noith latitude is five degree %
andseventeen m inutes; and her greatest south latitude is f.yj
degrees and twelve minutes, or thereabout.
The Moon is never stationary nor retrograde, but always
direct; though when she is slow in motion, and goes less than
th rte tn degrees in twenty four hours $ she is considered equiva­
lent to a retrograde Planet. Her exaltation is in the third de­
greeof Taurus, her detriment in Capricorn, and her fall in
three degrees of Scorpio. I!er orb or radiation, is twelve de­
grees before and after any of her aspects > and she rules
overall infants until the seventh year of their age.
The Moon is feminine, nocturnal, cold moist, and phleg­
matic. Her influence, in its self is neither fortunate or unfor­
tunate, but as she happens to fall in with the configurations of
theother Planets; and is then either malevolent or otherwise,
as those aspects happen to be. And under these circumstan­
ces she becomes the most powerful of all the heavenly bodies

lent and phlegmatic. If she be impeded of the Sun at the
time of birth she leaves a blemish on or near the eye y if she
be impeded in succedant Houses, the blemish will be near the
eye ; but if unfortunate in angles, and with nebulous fixed
Stars, the blemish will fall in the eye, and will affect the sight.
I f she be well placed, or dignified at the nativity, the Native
will be of soft engaging manners and disposition, a lover of
the polite arts, and of an ingenious imagination, fond of no­
velties, arA given to travelling, or rambling about the coun­
try ; unstable, and providing only for the present time, care­
less offuturity ; timorous, prodigal, and easily affrighted, but
loving peace, and desiring to live free from the cares and anx­
ieties of the world. I f the Native be brought up to a me­
chanical employment, he will be frequently tempering with a
variety of different trades, but pursuing none of them long to.
gether. I f the Moon be unfortunate at the birth, the Native
will then be slothful, indolent, and of no forecast, given up to
a drunken, disorderly, beggarly life, hating labour, or any
kind of business or employment. When oriental she enclin-
eth more to corpulence; but when occidental, rather lean
awkward, and ill formed.
She is in friendship with Jupiter, Sol, Venus and Mercuty,
but at enmity with Saturn and Mars. Her greatest year is
three hundred and twenty; her greater is one hundred and
eight $ her mean year is sixty six ; and her least year is twen­
ty five.

9 Venus*
Venus is the next Planet below the Earth and Moon, hav­
ing her orbit within that of the Earth. She is computed to be
fifty nine millions o f miles from the Sun, to which she would
fall in thirty nine days, and seventeen hours if her projectile
force was destroyed, and by moving at the rate of sixty nine
thousand uriles every hotrr, she passes through the twelve
Signs o f the Zodiac, in two hundred and twenty four days,
seventeen hours, of our time nearly. Her diameter is seven
thousand nine hundred ami six miles, and by diurnal mo­
tion she is carried about her equator forty three miles every
Itour, besides the sixty nine thousand above mentioned.
W hen she appears west of the Sun, she rises before him in
the morning and is called the morning Star $ but when she
appears east of the Sun, she shines in the evening after ho
•etsj and is then called tlie evening Star; and continues al­
ternately for the space of two hundred and ninety days, in
each ot these situations. It may perhaps be thought Mispris­
ing at first, that Venus should continue longer on the east
or west side of the Sun, than the whole time of ber period
round him, but the difficulty vanishes when we. consider that
the Earth is aU the while going round the Sun the same way,

though not so quick as Venus 5 and therefore her relative mo­
tion to the Earth must in every period be much slower j
than her absolute motion in her orbit, as the Earth during that !
time advances forward in the Ecliptic, which is two hundred
and twenty degrees. To us she appears through the teiescopt f
in all the various shapes of the Moon. ?
J
,er mJan- motion is
fifty nine minutes eight seconds, and her daily or swift mo­
tion is from sixty two minutes, to one degree twenty two mi­
nutes. Her exaltation is in twenty seven degrees of Pices;
her detriment in Aries aud Scorpio, and her fall in twenty
seven degrees of Virgo.
She continues retrograde forty two days, and is stationary
two days before and two days after retrogradalion. Her orb
o t radiation, is seven degrees before and after any of her as-‘
pectsi.
Vepus is a feminine Planet, temperately cold and moist,
nocturnal, the ies^er Fortune, author of mirth and cdnviviali-
ty, alluring to procreation, and to the propagation o f the spe­
cies. When she ascends at a nativity, she gives a handsome-
but not tall stature $ complexion fair and lovely, bright spark­
ling eyes, of a dark hazle or black, the face round, regular,
smooth and engaging; the hair bright thrown, hazel, cr
chesnut, shining and plentiful; the body regular and well

quiet, even, and friendly disposition, naturally inclined to
neatness, loving mirth and chearfulness, and delighting in
music; amourous, and prone to veuery, though truly virtu­
ous, if a* w o m an ; yet she will be given to jealousy, even
without cause. I f this Planet be weak and afflicted bv cross
aspects, then will the Native be riotous, profligate, abandon,
ed to evil company and lewd women, regardless of reputation
or character, a frequenter of taverns, night-bouses, and
places of ill fam e; delighting in all the incitements to inces­
tuous and adulterous practices; in principle a mere athiest,
wholly given up to the brutal passions of unbridled and un-
dtivated nature. I f Venus be oriental at the time, the sta­
ture will be tall/ and straight; but if occidental, short and
stooping, though comely and well favoured. I f she be gigni-
fleator in a journey, and well dignified, she portends much
mirth, pleasure, and success, and promises safety aud good

his revolution, or traverses through the twelve Signs o f the
Zodiac in eighty seven days and twenty-three hours of our
time nearly; which is the length of his year. But being sel­
dom seen, on account of his proximity to the Sun, and having
no spots visible on his disk, or surface, the rotation upon his
own axis, and the length of his days and nights, are as yet
unknown to us. His distance from the Sun is computed to bo

fire thousand miles, every hour; and receives from that lun\i-
nary a proportion o f light and heat, almost seven times as
that of the Eni\h. At .he times he becomes visible, he ap­
pears of a bright silver color, tl.ccgh fct.erally faint and
duskish to the naked eye. His mean motion is fifty nine mi­
nutes and eighty seconds, and sometimes tuxty minutes; and
bis diurnal motion is most times one hundred minutes a day.
His greatest latitude, both north and s6uth, is three degrees
thirty three minutes. His exaltation is in fifteen degrees of
V'/rgo; detriment in Sagittarius and Pisces, and his fall in
fifteen degrees of Pisces. He is retrograde twenty four day>;
and stationary one day before, and one day after retrogrudatu
on. H is orb, or radiaton is seven degrees before and after
any aspect.
Mercury is the least of all the Planets, in nature cold dry
and melancholy ; but author of the most pointed wit, inge­
nuity and invention. He is occasionally both masculine and
fem iuine; and lucky, or unlucky, as his position in the hea­
vens may happen to be. When he is in conjunction with a
masculine Planet, he is masculine; when w ith a feminine
Planet, feminine; good and fortunate, when joined with the
Fortunes; but evil and mischievious, when in conjunction
with malevolent aspects.
When he governs a na'ivity, lie denotes tall, straight,
thin, spare body, uarrow face, and deep forhead, long

joints large and well set, with small grey eyes. But if occb
dental, the complexion will be quite sallow, lank body, small
•lender limbs, hollow eyes, of a red cast, and of a dry cons­
titution. I f Mercury be well dignified at the time of birth,
the Person will inherit a strong subtile imagination, and re­
tentive memory $ likely to become an excellent orator* and lo­
gician, arguing with much eloquence of speech, and with
•trong powers o f persuasion. Is generally given to the attain­
ment of all kinds of learnings an encourager of the liberal
arts 5 of a sharp, witty, and pleasant conversation ; of an un­
wearied fancy, and curious in the search of all natural and
occult knowledge j with an inclination to travel, or trade into
foreign countries. I f brought up in the mercantile line, will
be ambitious o f excelling in his merchandize, and will most
times prove succesful in obtaining wealth.
But if he is evilly posited, or debilitated, then the Native
will betray a disposition to slander, and abuse the charater of
every one without distinction; he will be a boaster, a flatter­
er, a sycophant, busy-body, a tale bearer, given to prpogate
idle tales and false stories 5 pretending to all kinds of know­
ledge, though a mere idiot in his intellectual faculty, and in­
capable of acquiring any solid or substantial learning, apt to

Sol, or the Sun is an immense globe or body of fire, placed
in the common centre, or rather in the lower focus of the or­
bits of all the Planets and Comets, and turns round his axis
in twenty five days and six hours, as is evident by the motion
of the spots visible on his surface. His diameter is computed to
be seven hundered and sixty three thousand miles j\andby the
various attractions of the circumvolving Planets, he is agitated
by a small motion round the centre of the gravity of the sys­
tem. He passes through the twelve signs of the Zodiac
threehundred and sixty five days, five hours, forty eight mi­
nutes, and fifty-seven seconds, which forms the tropical, or

aud sometimes sixty one minutes, six seconds. H e constantly

latitude ; and for the same reason, is never stationary or re*
trograde. His exaltation is in nineteen degrees of Aries ;
his detriment in Aquarius 5 and his fall in nineteen degrees
of Libra. His orb, or radiation, is fifteen degrees before 4nd
after alt his aspects.
The Sun is in nature masculine, diurnal and dry, but more
temperate than Marrs, and if welt dignified, is always found
equivalent to one of the Fortunes. When he presides at a
birth, the Native is generally of a large, bony, string body,
of a sallow sun-burnt complexion, large high forehead, with
light or sandy curling hair, but inclined to be soon bald; a
fine, full, piercing, hazel eye.; and all the limbs straight and
well proportioned. I f he is well dignified, the Native will

Affable, and courteous; :in friendship faithful and sincere;
in promises slow, but punctual. The solamoan is not o f ma­

his deportment is stately and majestic; alover of sumptuous*
ness and magnificence; and possesses a mind far superior to
any sordid, base, or dishonourable practises. I f the Sun be
unfortunate, then will the Native be horn of a mean and lo­

ft Dragon's Head and Dragon's Tail.
The head of the Dragon is mascular, partaking o f the na­
ture both of Jupiter and Venus ; but the Dragon’s tail is fe»
nainine, and of a direct opposite quality to the head. These
are neither Signs nor constellations, but are only the node*
or points wherein the eclyptic is intersected by the orbits of
the Planets, and particularly by that.of the Moon, making
with it angles of five degrees and eighteen minutes. One of
-these points looks northward, the Moon beginning then to
have a northern latitude; and the other points southward,
where she commences her southern latitude. But it mustbe
observed that these points do not always abide in one place,,
but Have a motion of their own in the Zodiac, and ratr-pgrade-
wise, three minutes and eleven seconds per day >corapleating
their circle, in eighteen years and two hundred and twenty*
five days$ so that the Moon can be hut twice in the ecliptic
during her monthly period $ but at all other times, she will
have a latitude or declination from the ecliptic. The head of
the Dragon is considered of a benevolent nature, and ahqpst
equivalent to one of the Fortunes, and when in aspect with,
evil Planets is found to lessen their malignant effects in a
great degree, But the Dragon's tail I have always found of a
most evil and unhappy tendency, not only tending to the
malevolence of unfortunate aspects,, when joined with them,
but lessening considerably the beneficial influences of the
Fortunes, and other good aspects, whenever found in conjunc­
tion with them.

fiery Sign : a man well spoken, religious, or at least a good
moral, honest man ; a person comely and somewhat fat if %

lour, but in watery Signs, being with fixed Stars of his own

ly Signs, the hair is like a sad brown, or of a sad chesnut
colour. He hath a mart or scar in his face, is broad'shoul­

Thus by knowing the colour or complexion attributed to
each of the Planets and Si£ns, it is easy to determine the com­
plexion o f the Native, or of any person or thing enquired
after; for as the complexion or colour of the lord of the A s­
cendant, or the Sign, or significators are, that represents the
party, such will be their colour or complexion. So if it bt
asked concerning two Cocks just going to pit, which shall be
the winner? erect the figure exactly when the question is
propounded, and the two Planets representing the distinguish*
ing colours of the two Cocks, namely the lord of the Ascen­
dant and lord of the seventh shall be their significators, and
that Planet which is the superior, or4
that has most essential
dignities, and is molt strongly fortified, shall by his colour
point out the Cock that shall win his battle, so of any other
question determinable by colours.
Besides the foregoing natural influences of the Planets,
which they produce on the human frame, as ofteu as they
bear absolute rule at a birth; it must also be remembered,
that they differ in their effects, according as they are possited
or impeded by other aspects at the timfc ; and these variations
must be attentively perused and digested, before any correct
judgment can be formed on the circumstances of a nativity.
I shall therefore arrange them under distinct heads, and
*hew in the first place, how their natural qualities are chang­
ed, by their different aspects and positions in the Heavens.

troversy, as for instance, Dandelion before mentioned, this*
plant being ly my rules under Venus, but some Authors at-
. tribute it to Jupiter, because it has a virtue to open the ob-

whereas Jupiter is hot; N ow to reconcile this, or any differ-
rence of the like nature, observe the following rules. Let
both Planets in dispute at the time o f gathering, be in conjunc­
tion, sextile, or trine aspect to each other ; or otherwise let
the Moon be separating, and applying by any of those aspects
from the one Planet to the other, by this rule you may hare
the true planetary influence of both Planets in question,' pro­
vided always that the lord of the hour accord with the first
elemental quality of the Planet, whether hot or cold •, where­
fore in this condition, Venus must be-lord of the hour at th
e
time of gathering the herb, or plant accordingly. I shall in

stance one herb morej suppose it was required to gather
Sweet-marjoram, which plant is by many Authors attributed
to the Planet Mercury ; the reason they give is, because M
cr.
cury is conjoined in some particular operations 0/ the brain,
and this plant is of known virtue to comfort the brain. But
by my rules r.nd daily experience, I find it to be under the do­
minion of the Sun ; first, by reason of its elemental qualities^
as agreeing with heat and draught; secondly, in regard of it*
virtues, for all herbs and plants which are of a sweet sm
ell,
and of approved virtues to comfort the heart, brain, nerves,
arteries and Vital spirits, as this plant is, are justly and rati­
onally accounted to be under the government of the Sun, who
is the fountain of life, light and motion, lord of Leo, and ex­
alted in Aries, whereas Mercury hath only predominance
over some particular operations of the brain, as he hath also
in the five senses. It is generally approved of by all Authors,
that the bulk of the brain in all creatures, is under the power
and dominion of the Moon. The vital and quickening.part

to gather tilts plant at the right planetary hour, that so you
may hare the influence of both Planets iu question, you must
do as before expressed; let those Planets concerned, either be
in conjunction sexfilc or trine aspect to each other at the time
of gathering; or otherwise let the Moon be separating and ap­
plying from the one Planet to the other, at the time of ga­
thering by any o f the forementioned aspects; for instance,
suppose I was inclined to gather the said Sweet-marjorum in
August 1809, about which time such like plants are in their
prime to gather; in which month, on the 25th. day the Sun
and Mercury are in partile conjunction, but their influence
holds above a week before and after, for ’till they are sepa­
rated ten degrees from each other, their otbs rays, or influ­
ence holds stroDg to perfection, wherefore you may gather
plants aright on Sunday the thirteenth day, from Sun rising,
(fifty minutes after four) ’till one minute after six, when the
firstplanetary hour ends, or on Sunday the twentieth day,
from 'Sun rising ’till the end of the first planetary hour, and
likewise in the afternoon, from the seventh to the eigth hour,
as appears in the table of the planetary hours. You may also
gather herbs any days of those weeks, when the Sun is lord of
the hour, and let the Moon apply to him by sextile or trine
which will be so much the better; and hereby let it be re­
membered, the planet which is lord of the hour, and the
plant which is to be gathered must both agree in elemental
qualities, especially of the.first part of heat or cold, as for in­
stance, B alm ,' Rosemary, Marigolds, Angelica and such like
plants, areaH hot and dry in the first and second degree, per­

Some observations concerning sympathy: of cure*
Whereas in the description of plant*., {Jie Planet Saturn
hath but few herbs or plants allotted him, yet notwithstanding
what griefs, or infirmities whatever produced by any Planet#
there are herbs by sympathy, as well as antipathy to cure i t ;
therefore observe, that although an herb, or pl^nt may by ele­
mental qualities be under the dominion of Mars, as being hot
and dry, and so gathered, at his hour, yet, because of his vir­
tues, and being good t? qufe such infirmities which are under
the dominion of Saturn, it may justly and rationally be called
a sympathetica! cure, because Mars is exalted in, Capricorn,
the house of Saturn. For instance, agues, especially, quar­
tans, are usually produced, by Saturn. N ow W o rm w o ^
Cardiff, Benedictup, and such like plants, being hot and dry#
are properly attributed to Mara, both in point of gathering,
apd numbers, yet, because these herbs and plants ar? of,well
known virtues to cure agues, which Saturn, produced^ and
hlar6 being.exalted in Capricorn, which, is the house of Sa­
turn j therefore it may be properly called a symppthetiqal cure,
And so herbs under the dominion of Sol, cure infirmities, by
sympathy produced by Mars, because the Sun is exalted in
Aries, the house of Mara; also herbs under Venus cure bjr
sympathy infirmities under Jupiter, because Venus is exalted
in Pisces, the house of Jupiter; and so herbs of Jupiter cure
by sympathy such diseases which are under the dopiinipn of.
the M oon; because Jupiter is exalted in Cancer, which iaJh^f
house. The benefit which we have from this observation is
tbps: if Saturn, Mars, or any other Planet be the afflicting
Planet, and strong, (which argues a compliance) then tho*e

herbs which are under the dominion of that Planet which is
exalted in his house, being good for curing, the infirmity may
be used, and (for this reason) it shall be called a sympatheti­
ca) cure, for when Planets are strong and afflicting, we must
comply with them. Let it also be remembered that in all
lympathetical cures whatever, there must be one elemental
quality in the Planet, of compliance with the nature of the
Planet afflicting $ for instance, herbs under Mars have the
quality of drought with Saturn, and herbs under the Sun
have the quality o f heat with Mars, and herbs under Venus
have the quality of moisture with the Moon. The truth is I
find by good experience, especially in very cold infirmities, as
agues, dead palsies, and such like, it is impossible to make a
•ympathetical cure when Saturn is strong, was it not for those
observations before mentioned being in force approved3 as
for example, if the patient be old, bis disease cold, complex­
ion cold, the season of the year cold, and bis remedies to be
applied"cold, it must consequently destroy nature, for whsre
heat is wanting, there can be no life 3 but if Saturn be the
afflicting Planet and weak, then herbs which are under the
dominion o f the Sun and Jupiter, being of known-virtue to
cure the distemper or grief will do it 3 they being by nature
hot and m oist3 whereas Saturn is by nature cold and dry,
quite different in elemental qualities to each other, and this
is called an antipathetical cure, but in all infirmities whatever
which are produced by the evil influence of Mars, he being
strong in the Heavens, the remedies used must be by such
herbs or plants which are’under his own dominion, together
with hhrbs o f the Sun ; but if the complexion of the Patient,

then tp use. some small numbers and doles of such h&rbswhich
are under tfee dominion of Venus, may be proper at seme con-
▼ enienjt times, to give the patient towards, the refreshening of
nature, yet chiefly in point of cure, you must adhere to those >
herbs and plant* which pre under Mars, and .the Sun, where*
by to work your cure j for,if you should give cooling romp-
dies ip hot distempers, when Mars is strong'it will destroy the
Patient, as I have sufhcieptly proved j hut if Mars be tty;
afflicting Planet and weak, then ihpsc herb** and planed under
the dominion of Venus and the Mpon, together with a select
number of kerbs under the dominion of the Sun will do it,
(for his herbs must always be used,) and here note, that w ta
the Sun, or any other Planet whose herbs you intend to gather
be strong in the Heavens, the lesser number of his herbs aje
required* N . B. In gathering all kinds of herbs apd pW*
whatever, more especially when you intend to do any great
cure, to get the influential virtue of ope of the Fortunes, viz.
the. Sun, Jupiter, or Venus, to be joined, or be in soree
friendly aspect with that Planet which owns the plant, always
have regard to the infirmity, or grief, which either by sym­
pathy or antipathy hath any relation to the Fortunes j as
instance, Endive, which is cold and d*y under Mercuiy, JP*
because it’s approved good to cool the heat qf the liver, whifh
is under Jupiter, therefore let Jupiter be in conjunction, un­
tile, or frine aspect to Mercury, or the Moon separating apd

and particularly to acquire a correct knowledge o f all the cha­

Application signideth^the approach of two Planets togp*

thf first is when a Planet, swift in motion applies to one of a

fourteen degrees of Gemeni, and Mars in nineteen degrees of
the same Sign, both being in direct motion, Mercury by hav­
ing tjie greater apparent projectile force, would overtake, add
fprm a. conjunction with Mars, which is termed a direct ap­
plication. The second kind is farmed by two retrograde Pla­
net*; as, supposing Mercury in eighteen degrees of Gemini,
and W ars in seventeen degrees of the same sign, both retro­
grades ; Mercury being the lighter Planet, applies to the bo­
d y o f M ars, a more ponderous Planet, by retrogradation and

occasioned by one Planet going direct in motion, and meeting
another Planet that is retrograde j for instance, suppose M /r»
cury retrograde in eighteen degrees of Gemeni, and Satnm
direct in thirteen degrees of the same sign 5 here Mercury be.
ing the lighter Planet, applies to a conjunction of Saturn by :
a retrograde motion; and these two last are deemed evil ap­
plications. Observe, the superior Planets never apply to the
inferior, but by a retrograde motion $ whereas the inferior
Planets apply both ways.
Prohibition indicates the state of two Planets that art
aignificators of some event, or the bringing of some business
to an issue or conclusion, and are applying to each other by
conjunction 5 but. before such a conjunction can be formed, a
/ third Planet, by means of a swifter motion interposes his bo­
dy, and destroys the expected conjunction* by forming th t
aspect himself} and this indicates that the matter under con­
templation will be greatly retarded, or utterly prevented.
For example, suppose Mars wafe posited in nine degrees o f
Aries, Saturn in fourteen degrees,, and the Sun in eight de*
grees of the same sign $ Mars is the significator of the busi­
ness in hand, and promises the completion of it, as soon at
he comes to a conjunction with Saturn 5 but the Sun being
swifter in motion than Mars, passes him, and prevents their
conjunction by forming the aspect himself. This indicates
that whatever was expected from the approaching conjunctu
on of Mars and Saturn, is now prohibited by the Sun’s firkt
impediting Mars, and then Saturn ; and this is termed a cob-
junctional or bodily prohibition. There is also a prohibition^
by aspect, either sextile, qunrtile,■ •trine, or opposition 5 and
this happens when two Planets are going into coinjunction.

SopposeMars to be in nine degree%o f Aries, Saturn in tbir*
teen degrees of the same Sign, and the San in seven degrees
ofGemini, the San being swifter than Mars in his ditirnal
motion, w ill quickly overtake him, and pass by the textile def­
terof M ars and forms a sextile dexter with Saturn before Mau)
cm reach him $ -by this means their conjunction is prohibited.
S v a t io iia e t is understood of a Planet when to tbeeye, or
senses of a beholder here on earth it appears to stand still, with*
o at any progressive motion in its orbit. Not that a Planet
erdr is, or can be naturally in this stated but is only rendered
so in appearance, by the inequalities which ari^a trom the
positions and motions of the earth $ for, were the Planets to
be viewed from the Sun, or centre of the system, they would
always appear uniform and regular. This is the case'before
aud aftet retrogradatioq.
R e t b o g b a d a t i o k implies an apparent motion in tie Pla­
nets, whereby they seem to go backwards in die ecliptic, and
to move towards the antecedent signs, viz. from east to west,
contrary to the succession of .Signs and degrees of the Zodiac,

Cazimi, is when a Planet is situated in the heart of th
e
Sun, and is only seventeen minutes before or after the San?
as if the Sun was in seventeen degree* thirty minutes of Tau­
rus, and Mercury in seventeen degrees twenty minutes of the
same Sign, Mercury would be then in Cazimi, or in the heart
o f the Sun. All Authors agree that a Planet in Cazimi is fo*>
tified thereby, and is of greater efficacy; whereas a Planet
Combust is of a malignant nature,. It should be carefully ob*
served that all Planets may be combust of the Sun, but the
Sun cannot be combust of any Planet, and that combustion
can only be by personal conjunction in one Sign, and not by
*any aspect, either sextile, quartile, trine, or opposition $ the
Sun’s quartile, or opposite aspects are afflicting, but they do
not render the Planet combust.
Sun’s » b a m $. A Planet is always considered under
Sun-beams, until he. is fully elongated seventeen degrees be­
fore and after his body.
Void op course, is when aPlanet is separated frofn tk*
body or aspect of another Planet, and does not during its con*
tinuance in that Sign form any aspect with, any other. Thii
most usually happens with the Moon 5 and in practice it if
observed, that if the significator of the; thing propounded be
void of course, the business under contemplation will no*
succeed, nor be attended with any satisfactory or pleasing
consequences.

the two malevolent Planets, Saturn and M ars; for instance*
if Saturn was placed in the fifteenth degree o f Aries, Mars in
the tenth, and Jupiter in the thirteenth degree, Jupiter would
then be besieged by Saturn and Mars.
Incmasing in light, is when a Planet if departing from
the Sun, or the Sun from a Planet; thus, the Moon at her
greatest distance from the Sun appears with the greatest
degree o f light, having her whole orb illuminated.
Separation, is when two Planets have been lately in partilo
conjunction or aspect, and are just separated from it. Thus,
if we suppose Saturn in ten degrees of Sagittary, and Jupiter
in eleven degrees of the same sign; Jupiter will be then sepa­
rated one degree from a perfect or partile conjunction with
Saturn ? but they would still be in a platick conjunction, be*
causa they are within the moiety of each others radiations#
which is four degrees and a half each, consequently these Pla­
nets would continue iq platick conjunction until they were sepa­
rated nine degrees, and then the aspect would entirely cease.
The exact knowledge of every degree of the separations of
these aspects is of the utmost consequence in giving judgment
upon various important occasions.
F r u s t r a t i o n , is when a swift or light Planet approaches to
an aspect with one more slow and ponderous, but before they
can approach near enough to form that aspect, the weighty
Planet is joined to some other, by which the first aspect i*
frustrated. For instance, -suppose Saturn posited in eigh­
teen dfgrees o f Gemini, Jupuc" in seventeen degrees of Leo,
and Mars in thirteen degrees of the same Sign ; heie \ ars ap­
plies to a conjunction with Jupiter, but before he can reach it,

100 TH* CELfefcTIAt iN+ftLLIGfcttClE.
Jupitfcr meets a sextile aspect from Saturn, which frustrate*
the conjunction of Mars, and in practice utterly destroys
whatever was promised by it.
Rifranatiom, is when a Planet in direct motion, applies to'
•n aspect or conjunction with another Planet, but before they
can meet becomes retrograde, and thns refrains to form the
aspect expected. Suppose Jupiter in the eighth degree o f Ge­
mini, and Mars In the fourth; here Mars the swifter Planet**
promises very soon to overtake Jupiter, and form a conjunc­
tion w ithhim 5 but just arthe instant, feds retrograde, and
refrains from the conjunction, by taking an opposite course
from Jupiter.
Translation of light and virtue, is when a fighter
Planet separates from a weighty one, and joins With another
more ponderous, and is effected in this manner ; let Saturn be
placed in sixteen degrees of Aries, Jupiter in nine degrees,
and Mars in ten degrees of the same. Sign ; here Mars sepa­
rates from a conjunction with Jupiter, and translates the light
and virtue of that Planet to Saturn, to whom he next applies-
The effect of this in practice will be, that if a matter or thing
be promised by Saturn, then whoever was represented by
M ars shall procure all the assistance that the benevolent Planet
Jupiter could possibly bestow, and translate it to Saturn,
whereby the business in hand would be the better effected,
and the more happily concluded. This is a very fortunate po­
sition of the Planets, and therefore very proper to be known#
since it not only promises much in nativities, but also ia law*
suits, marriages, and all other questions of the kind, as at a
future period I may present the reader with the doctrine r f
Horary questions.

R e c e p t i o n , is when two Planets that are significators in
any question or nativity, are posited ill each others dignities,
as the Sun in Aries, and Mars in Leo, which is a reception
by Houses, and is deemed the most powerful and efficacious
: of all receptions. But reception may be by exchange of
' exalration, triplicity, term or phase, as Jupiter in Aries, and
*the Sun in Cancer, is a reception by exaltation, so Venus in
Aues, and the Sun in Taurus is a reception by triplicity, if
the question or nativity happen by day, or if Venus be in the
twenty forurth degre of Aries, and Mars in the eighteenth
degree of Gemini, it is reception by terms. The use of these
positions in practice is considerable j for, suppose the event
yof any question required, be denied by the aspects, or the
significators are in no aspect with each other; or it is doubt­
ful what may happen from a quartile or opposition of the sig-
• ni/icators.; yet, if the principal siguificators are found in mu­
tual reception, the 4thing desired will shortly come to pi^sv
and probably to the satisfaction and content of all the parties
concerned.
P e r e c ^ i n e , is when a Planet is situated in a Sign, or in
such certain degrees of a Sign where it has no essential dig­
nities, either by house, exaltation, triplicity, term, or phases,
as Saturn in the tenth degree of Aries, and Mers in the
twelfth degree of Taurus is peregrine. So also the Sun in a-
ny part o f Cancer is peregrine; having no dignities whatever
in that Sign. In all questions of Theft it is very material to
know the peregrine Planet; for it has been uiniformly found
by every regular professor of this Science, that the Thief may

almost constantly be discovered by the peregrine Planet posi­

O r i e n t a l and o c c id e n t a l , A Planet when oriental rises
before the Sun ; and when occidental sets after him, and is seen
above the Horizon after the Sun is down ; consequently when
a Plaliet is oriental, it is posited in the east, and when occi­
dental in the west.
D i r e c t i o n , is when a Planet moves according to the suc­
cession of the Signs, from west to east, or from IT to g ,
from g to I I ; and out of five degrees, to six, seven, eight,
and so forward. Direction }s also a calculus, whereby to
find the time of any accident or remarkable event, that will
happen to a Person who propounds a-question, or has his na­
tivity cast. For instance, a Person enquires how long he
may live, by the course of the Planets at the time of birth?
having established the Sun, Moon, or Ascendant, as signifi-
cators of life, and Mars, or Saturn, as promittars, or porten-
tors of death, the direction is a calculation o f the length of tim
e
in which the significators w ill be in meeting the proroittor,
and this resolves the question.
Superiors ;.nd i n f e r i o r s , Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are
distinguished by the name of the superior, ponderous, and
more weighty Planets; and Venus, Mercury, and the Moon,
are called the inferior Planets. _

when he moves less than his mean motion in the same porti­

ciple of nature $ it follows that I should explain the accidental
qualities they receive by their ditferent positions in the
twelve Houses of Heaven j for as the Heavens are perpetually
in motion, cither ascending or descending; and since it is
beyond the reach of human penetration to define what Star ]
or Planet shall ascend at the nativity of Children yet unborn, |
so in reference to human ideas, it is purely accidental whit j
dignities the Planets shall acquire, ck Htrt&e the}’ shall
be posited in at the time of birth.
That the reader may form a compentent idea of what is
meant by the twelve Houses of Heaven, let us suppose the
whole celestial Globe, or Sphere of Heaven divided into
four equal parts, by the Horizon and Meridional line, and
each of these into four quadrants, and each quadrant into three
equal parts, by Hues drawn from points of Sections in different
parts of the Hor$bn and Meridian, equally distant from each
other. By this operation, the whole Globe Sphere' will
be apportioned into twelve equal parts, tvhieh uonati&rte
what we call, the Twelve Houses of Heaven. And ihese
Houses, as observation and experience abundantly shew, make
up that great wheel of nature, whereon depends the various
fortunes contingent to all sublunary matters and things.
In this division of thd Heavens', the first Quadrant is de­
scribed by a paralled line, drawn from the point of ihe east an­
gle, to the south, or Mid-Reaven ; and contains the twelfth,
eleventh, and tenth Houses, called the Oriental, Vernal,
Masculin, Sanguine and Infant quarter. The Second Qua­
drant is described by a similar line, running from the exteri­

The third Quadrant is formed by a paralled line, running from

move, is called the Cusp of the Houses, and that of the as­
cendant is generally reckoned to extend about five degree*
above the Earth, and twenty five degrees beneath, ready to
ascend, but if Signs of long ascension ascend, then half i
five degrees above the Earth, and thirteen degrees be­
low, are its utmost limits. If Signs of short ascensiotr
ascend then five degrees above the Horizon, and fifty be- j
low are usually allowed. Now the quality of whatsoever j
part of the Heavens occupy, or fill up the degrees of this
House, carries along with it the health, life, and nature of |
every Infant or Thing that is conceived or brought forth
within its jurisdiction. And hence hath this point o f the
Heavens a faculty of attracting or receiving the virtues of the
celestial matter, that is accidently ascending in that part of
Heaven at the birth, and also of the Planets and fixed Star*
in their transits, and all the rays of the Planets in their as­
pects and conjunctions, are attracted into this part of Heaven
in order to the formation of the shape, stature, temperature
of the body, quality of the mind, and all accidents and con­
tingencies which shall befall the Native's body, or health, ot
life, unto his dying day •, such a sympathy is there between thi»
part of the heavenly frame, and of every aet and thing that is
produced, or receives life -under it. For as the seed in the
ground, after it ha9 taken root, buds forth, and appears a*
bove ground, so the Heavenly Intelligencers, after they have
framed the embryo, and the temperament thereof, under the
Earth, give it life and being of its own, putting forth level
with them just as they ascend. W e do not however suppose,
that the temperature jmd qualities of the Native were wholly
framed at the exact time of birth, although the'situation of the

Heavens at that time never foils exactly to describe them,
we have every reason to believe that the temperature and
qualities o f Che body, and the disposition of the mind, are form­
ed in regular gradations from the conception to the time of
birth ; but that the birth describes them is indisputably clear,
because it cannot happen at any moment of time, in any part
of the world, but it must fall even with that part of the heaven­
ly matter ascending from the lower unto the upper Horizon,
and therefore points out those temperatures and qualities.
For any Man to be satisfied in this point, let him but note
what the nature of this ascending point of Heaven is, with all
the Stars and Planets'posited therein, or having aspect with
them from other Houses, giving each of them their due
weight and influence, according to their nature and dignity,
neither strained one way nor the other $ and just as these are
found at the time of birth, just so shall be found the qualities
and mental endowments of that Native, with the prinepial
actions andeirerits of bis life, which this point ascending takes
tha charge of. . And in this trial will the Reader nnd more
substantial proofs of the truth and existence of Astrology, than
the most acute arguments can instii into his mind.
N ow , since the first House or ascendant gives birth and life
to the Native, it follow that thcs;j Houses which are the attend­
ants on, and upholders of life should bejoined with i t ; and as
Children, or the Native’s Offspring are the upholders of life
in this world, and religion and learning the grand nu'ans of
upholding it unto eternity in the other world, so the Houses
which contribute these blessings to the life already given, are
joined in an n 1: monious trine with the first House, making up
that a three fold cord, which, as Solon saith, can never be

broken ; the one is qsucceedent House, called the fifth House,
and the other a cadent House, called the ninth House; and i
to be convinced of the effects of this fifth House, note the bea- i
venly matter, Planets, Stars, and aspect therein posited at the
timeofbirth, according to the rules here laid down, and theyshall
truly represent the number and state of the Native’s Otfspriug,
and all other particulars relative to Children, and to breeding
or barren Women. So also examine the state of the ninth
House, and as that represents, so shall the .Native be in
rtspect of Religion and Science ; for the heavenly mat­
ter, Planets, Stars, and aspects therein, shall shew what
and how the man shall prove, whether wise or foolish, devefat j
or sehismatical, and what study or occupation he shall be in- I
dined to follow j and these furnish mRtjter for grace to work
upon ; but as for grace itself, nature can have no power over
it j grace may rule nature, but nature cannot sway grace. *
The second angular point of the Houses of Heaven is call­
ed ihe Mii-We.wcn, which is that point which culminates,
being the very top or highest point of the heavenly frame.
And whatever part of the Heavens happen to be culminating
in this point at the birth of any person or thing, that it takes
chaige of, and carries along with it ever after the preferment,
honour, profession, situation and authority of the Native;
and as the. nature of the Planets, 'Stars; aspects, and heavenly
matter happens to be, that are situated in this point, or'in
the degrees pertaining to it, so shall the Native prove in his j
life-time, in point of dignity, a va; cement, and reputation rn
this world, whether high or low, fortunate or unfortunate,
favoured or disgraced.. The attendants upon, and upholders ,
of Man’s honour and dignity, as -the scriptures, and every
day’s experience perpetually shew us, are wealth and servant*.

Hie first of these is attached ta the Mid-Heaven in a aucce-
dent House, celled the second House of Heaven; and the
other in a cadent Houses called the sixth House of Heaven ;
stodthese two are situated in anharmonious trine with theangu­
larpoint of the Mid-Heaven< And now well observewhat the
Planets, Stan, aspects, and heavenly matter are in either of
these Houses at the time of birth, and such shall the Native'#
forttmeprove in respect of riches and subordinate dependants;
in the seoud House*for weahh, and in the sixth for servant#
or dependants.
The third angle of the figure of Heaven, is the seventh
House, or point of the Heavens and degrees Contingent,
Whichare,always descending, or setting out of our Horizon,
and sinking under thq Earth; and this point is directly oppo-
she to the eastern angle or ascendant. Now as the rising
Heaven or ascendant is the beginning and conduit of life, so
thissetting Heaven level with the ascendant, is the bringing
aU.mundane affairs level with life, such as our entrance inter
the state oj marriage; our contracts and enterprises in busi­
ness, war, and travel ; our connections and success therein,
whether with Friends, Strangers, or Enemies; and theser
whether Honest men, Parasites, or Thieves. And the heaven*
lp matter, Planets, Stars, and aspects, situated in this angle
atra nativity, apparently shew how a man shall fare in respect
of wises, more or less, any or none, good or bad; and in
matteis of business or adventure, how fortunate or unfortu*
•atebe-maybelikely to prove; and with Enemies or Thieves,
how far he islikely to be injured by them. Necessary uphold­

Ih p last angle of Heaven, i> the fourth House, called the
bottom o f Heaven, arjd represents that point which in our
conception seems to hang at the very bottom of the round
bail of the oelestial world, being diametrically opposite to the'
exteripr, dr Mifhfjpaven, And as that shews what a mania
the course of nature # M 1 rise to in the world; this, on the
contrary, declares what and when shall be his fall, deeayp
and death. This House lias therefore signification of the
end o f every Worldly concern, and amongst other ends, of the

or great, .And the Planets, Stars, and.aspects posited in tbit

tious,. The upholders of this angle, are the Houses of tribu­
lation and death > the one a auccedent House, called th^
eighth House or House of death ; and the other a cadent
House, called the twelfth House. And how let it be care-»
folly observed what Planets, Stars, aspects* and heavenly
matter occupy these Houses at the time of birth, and they*
shall point our in the twelfth House, all the principal misfor-
tunes, afflictions, and tribulations of the Native's life, and
in the eighth House the time and manner of his death.
Jndejjendant of the faculties hitherto specified, each of
these Houses of Heaven have other significations and effects,
which they demonstrate in various other Ways, For instance,
the ascendant represents the Native coming into the world,
end the fourth House at the same time represents the parents
of the N ative going out; for, ** one generation goes off, and
another always comes in,** according to the course of nature.
Of these parents the Father is more especially signified by the
fourth House $ and then secondarily, but not so forcibly, the
Mother o f the Native is signified by the tenth Hoilse, and the
grandfather by the seventh, and uncles, aunts, and relations
on the father’s side by the sixth, and uncles, aunts, and relati­
ons on the mothers side, by the twelfth. Hence also it
conies to pass, that by the fourth House are signified
Houses and Lands, and all degrees of patrimony left by the
father 5 and by the eighth House are 9heWn all goods and le­
gacies left by will'of the deceased. The second and sixtH
House in half trine to the House of the grave, and in oppo­
sition to the eighth and twelfth, have a secondary sighifieatw
on of vfckncss and death.

o f Heaven, In (he common course o f nature; hut these quo*
lities are sometimes materially altered and changed for the
better or worse, either by the means of the Moon being a
conductor, or some other of the celestial motions or affecti­
ons. It is certain that the Moon circles the Earth once io
twenty eight days; but in this perambulation she neither
keeps the Sun s pathway in the ecliptic, nor continues bet
course constantly on the,same side of it; but once in every
foutteen days she crosses the ecliptic, alternately to her
•north and south declination; and It is (bund by repeated and
correct observation that the point in the Heavens where sbr
crosses the line, 4# strongly affected by her motion.. The
M ocnis the great body of life and'growth, and when ahe-p**
ses the ecliptic to the north, which brings her nearer into this
porthen world, she then gives an *extraordinary degree of
fruitfulness, which wonderfally strengthens with ks influence
whatsoever happens within the fine o f its jurisdiction. And
this point, wheiever it falls, is called the Moon’s north node;
but is distinguished in Astrological works, by the name cf
th e ft Dragon’s head, as alreadyeaplatned. If this point
happens to ascend in a nativity, it strengthens life, with a '
robust and lively constitution. I f it falls in the Mid-Heaven,
it promises great honour and preferment; if in the eleventh
House, prosperity and riches. J f Jupiter or Venus happens .
o be in these degrees, it makes th^tn much stronger and molt
efficatious in their benevolent operations; but if'Saturn er
Mars be posited there, it gives them on the contrary, a
stronger inclination to prove mischievous and unfortunate.
When the Moon intersects the ecliptic line to her southeni
declination, she leaves 4bat point ofth e Heavens whereaht

crosses it, which is termed the Dragon's tiil, as barren
to all iutents and purposes, as the other was fruitful. Hence
. this point ascending at a nativity, blemishes life and leaves a
. Main upon it ; impairs honour and advancement in the Mid-
. Heaven, wastes riches, brings adversity, and false friends in
. the eleventh, and foreshews a most wretched marriage if it
falls in the seventh House or western angle; aQd.it weakens
as well the benevolent auspices of % aud 9 , as the evil incli­
nations of I? and How these circumstances operate be­
yond the equinoctial, experience is yet silent; but it seem
•reasonable to suppose that the Dragon's tail is there tire fruit*
ful point, and the head the barren point, since when the
Moon is going off from us, her influence must be coining on -
with them. ,
Next to the Nodes the © part of Fortune has its operation
upon these twelve celestial Houses. The point which we term
the part of Fortune is only the distance of the Moon's
place from the Sun’s, added to the degrees of the ascendant;
and the nature of it is, as constant observation ascertains, tha^
i f this point falls among fortunate Stars, or in a fortunate
part o f the Heavens, then it promises great success in health,
wealth, honour or offspring, or any other species of prosperi­
ty, according to. it’s position, either in the first, eleventh, or
fifth Houses, or in any others. The reason of this appears to
be, that the Sun, Moon, and ascendant, being the prime con­
duits through which the stream of lif? flows, this seat of the
© part of Fortune is the harmony of all three, conceutring
and uniting in the same acts of benevolence.
N ow besides these, there are yet other qualities accidentally

come up oa any of his concerns, A*nd the places of the tenth
House, of the eleventh, of the ascendant, and of the ‘ second
House, generally promise as much good, as the other Houses
do evil, upon all the common occasions of life.
Thus far we have seen the operations of the twelve Houle*
of Heaven, as*they appertain to the time and circumstances of
a Nativity. W e shall now explain their properties in that
system of nature upon which the doctrine of Nativities and
Horary Questions are grounded. And such has been the in*
dustry and indefatigable labour of our forefathers ia bringing
this science to maturity, and in discovering and distinguish­

The first Hcfctse been signification of the life of Man, aHi
« f the stature, colour, completion, form axxl shape of hie*,
-who propounds a question, or has his nativity east j and as all
the vicissitudes o f nature depend upon the period of Man’s
life, so all questions are resolved by this House, that relates to
sickness, health, or long Ufej and also all accidents by which
life may be endangered, or impaired; what part of one’s
days wHl be the most happy and prosperous j whether any
absent friend or relation be liviug or dead $ of whether any
journey, voyage, or ship at sea will be attended with success
and safety, or whether meet with any accident fetal to life, or
destructive to the ship*— In short all questions relating to cir­
cumstances that affect life, are to be answered from the first
House. In State Astrology, and in Eclipses, great conjunc­
tions, appearances of Comets, and other luminous and extra­
ordinary Phenomena in the Heavens $ and upon the Sun’s
annual ingress into the equinoctial Sign Aries, the first House
bears signification of the community at large* or of that State,

sents the head and face, *> that if either O

' this House, either at the time of a question, or at the time of a
birth, yon will observe some blemish in the faceor in that meih-
ber governed, by the Sign that then is upon the Cusp of
the House; for instance, if T be in the ascendant, the
*mark, mole, or scar is always in the head, or face, and if
few degrees of the Sign ascend, the mark is. in the upper part
of the head >if the middle of the Sign be on the Cusp, the mole,
mark or scar is in the middle of the face, or near it $ if the
Jatter degrees ascend, the face is hkraised near the*chin to­
wards the neck. This rule I have found veritied in many
' nativities. O f colours, the first House gives a white,
.from which is to be understood, that if a Planet be po­
sited in this House that governs a light colour, ancf a
. question be propounded from any party, relative to a person,
, matter, or thing where colours are concerned,and this Planet
* be significatpr thereof, then the person’s complexion and
.dress, or if Cattle, then their colour shall be of a white, pale,
or lightish kind; and though this may appear ridiculous and
* insignificant to the understanding of some Readers, yet, this
rule is always found to be invariable in practice.' N o w as
every one of the twelve Houses of Heaven have their signifi-
- cators, so have they also their consignificators', w'hich hive
- frequent operations; and therefore ought to be considered.
- A consignificator is a Planet either fallen into conjunction, or
- joined in aspect with the principal significator; in which
eases the Planet either assists or opposes in the matter under
: consideration, if it be joined with 3 benevolent Planet, it iin-
, parts good ; but if it happens to be ihe contrary, it cither
. denotes destruction to the subject of inquiry, or great distnr-
1 bance in the effecting of it. The consiguificators o f this

From the second House we form judgment upon all quest!*
ow relating to wealth or poverty, prosperity or adversity*
and Jossor gain in any undertaking that may be propounded
by the Querent; and also concerning moveable goods, mo*
nejr lest or employed in speculation. In stsitaof law or equity,

the Son sentfance into Aries, itexpresses the strength o f tto&
Empire where the Figure is erected, in its Internal resources,
in itsallies, and in all other requisites ofwar, or self-defence.
Itgives a green colour, of which a similar use is to made as

From the foregoing circumstantial survey of the Twelve
Houses of Heaven according to the doctrine o f Ptolpmy, and
my own experience for many years, I trust the Reader will
be enabled to form such an idea of the nature of predicting

is justly said to rise into the World, the moment he receive*
respiration.—To be in complete perfection, when he attains
manhood or maturity, in the propogation of his species*—To
decline when he loves the innate radical principle of heat and
moisture.—And to sustain the last passions of life, when be
ceases to breath, and silently sinks into the grave. Life, Ac*
lion, Marriage, and Passions of Men, are therefore governed
by the same celestial principle, which regulates the birth, per­
fection declination, and dissolution of all other things. Where*
fore Life, in the system of nature, is regulated by the East
angle of the Heavens, called the Ascendant.—Action, by the
Sooth angle, or Mid-Heaven.—Marriage, by the West angle,
—
And Passion, by the North angle. And hence arise four tri*
pliciriis of the same genus or generical nature, as heretofore
described. The first Tyiplicity is of the Eastern angle, or
Ascendant, attributed to Infancy, and cmlled the triplicity df
Life, and Includes the first, ninth and fifth Houses, which
behold each other by a partile or exact trine in the Equator*
'* Sir C. Heydon says, and Dryden the great Poet subscribes
to it, tMt it is an aspect of perfect love, being in exact propor­
tion with one of the three perfect concords or harmonies 6£
music, vis* the Diapcnte j and two Stars so beholding each
other do proportionably occupy, or take up the whole center
of the World in the satne moment, and are said to aspect or
*behold each other by a perfect trine.
And herein the perfection of the first trine, vis. the eter*
ra Trinity of Infinite Love, is so stro ig and lively shewn,
by a similitude of nature, that it is called a perfect aspect of
friendship.

east angle to the Mid Heaven, so is the progresr madeiir all
our earthly acquisitions. The highest degree of Man’s elevw*
tion in t'lis world, is to that of majesty, power, honour,
dignity, preferment, or magistracy, or to any of those situa­
tions by v hich he acquires superiority and affluence.’ Thefe
consisting of immaterial matter, and forming the first order
of earthly dignity, claim the angular Hooseof this Triplicity,
' or the Mid-Heaven. The second degree ot wordly honour, is
‘conceived to arise from subjects, servants, tenants, vassals
and domestics; and these being formed qf matter maternal
■
and animated, are placed under tbe sixth House. The thin!
advancement to earthly grandeur, is by matter material and
animated, such as gold, jewels, and other valuable effect^,
accumulated by industry and sweat of the brow $ which be­
ing under the second House : these three Houses are alsojoin*
od by sympathy in a partHe trine, applying to &ach other in
•oncord and unanimity.
The third Triplicity comprehends worldly connections,
whether by marriage, consanguinity, or friendship, and
these holding on in the order of nature, even as the progress
is made from the Mid-Heaven to the western angle, apply to
the progressive tendency of youth to manhood and maturity.
In this stage of life, Man is joined in a three-fold tie or obli*
gat-ion $ in body, in blood, and in. friendship. First, he is
joined in body, by the most sacred of all earthly ties, roatri-
irony; sanctioned under the seal of God’s primary comaiandr
increase and multiply." Secondly, he is joined m cDnsan*
goinity, not only by the propogation of hislife, but by all or*
ders of his kindred in blood. Thirdly, he is joined in frier,d*
ship under that sacred bond of benevolence and love, which

treeof life promised in ounmore perfect state; and these arc

ty , is sacred to real friendship. These three Homes form an
unionof nature, and beholds each other in, or by* a partilfc
trios, according to the motion of the Equator.
The fourth and last TripHcity is that of passion, which
ownprehends the three classes of human afflictions. The first,
* angular House of this Triplicity, in allusion to its position
inthe lower Horizon, is termed the dark angle, the depth of
sight, and bottom of Heaven} the den and cave of the Stan
and Planets. To this House* is committed the first order of
tor woes, agreeable to the course of nature. These are in­
supportable misfortunes, and visible decline of life; the first
consequences of original sin, by which -Man is devoted to
corruption and decay, and to aft the infirmities of nature.
The second order of human afflictions, is tribulation, sor­
row
, and disease; arising either from the treachery and per­
secution of enemies, from the chains of servitude and bond­
age, or from poverty and want. These with a long (rain of
consequent miseries, are appropriated to the twelfth House.

governing it, first gain the hour and minute of the Sun’s rising,
thep observe what hours and minutes are elapsed, between
the hour and minute of birth, if by Day, and the Sun’s rising,
and multiply those hours by Sixty, and to the product add your
juinutes if any, and the total divided by the length of the Pla­
netary hour, the quotient gives your desire. Example, on
the 13th. of October, 1786, the Sun riseth in my Ephemeria
at thirty-seven minutes past six o'Clock, I would know what
Planet reigneth at eleven o’Clock that Morning, the time if
four hours, twenty-three minutes distant from the Sun rising
to the hour of birth, and the length of the Planetaiy hour by

T o point out the use of the foregoing Tables let the young
Learner observe the sun rises the 1st January, I 8O9, at 5
minutes after 8, distinguished 8 hours, 5 minutes, at the
top of the first column, in the foiegoing table, under the
title of © rises, against the 1st day of the month. F ro m 5

6( the first planetary hour that day, against which you w ill
sec 2, which shews the second hour ends at that time, and
so on through the whole tweuty-four hours.— Let it be also
remembered, the sixth hour ends at noon, the twelfth at sun
set, the eighteenth at midnight, and the twenty-fourth at sun*
rising the following day.
N ow suppose it was required by way of example to know
what Planet rules on Sunday, the first of January, I 8O9 , at
15 minutes past 9 o'clock, in the morning) I look in the
first column for p 2 3 20, against which, on the right hand
I find 2 ; this shews the second hour does not cud tiil 2 3 m i­
nutes’after g, consequently 15 minutes after 9 is in that space
of time allotted to the second hour which hath yet 8 minutes
to rule. I then refer to the second column in the above T a ­
ble of planetary hours for every day of the week, under the
title of Sunday planetary hour and look for 2, against which
on the left hand, I see 9 > which shews 9 rules the hour en­
quired after.
Again, I would know what Planet reigneth on Saturday,
the seventh of January, IS09, at past 7 o'clock in the even­
ing :— I look down the second column for 7 59 45, against
which on -the right hand I find 15 ; in the same maner this
shews the fifteenth hour does not end till 59 minutes after 7
rejecting the seconds $ •§
■ Pas* 7 o’clock that day must there­
fore be the fifteenth hour j I then* rcfei to the seventh column
of the small Table under Saturday planetary hour, and guide
ray eye downward till I see J5> against which on the left hand
is T?, which shews that !>. rules the hour required. And |tbus
you may proceed without the least trouble o f calculating for
any bout of the day or night throughout the year for ever.

The Signified*fan of each Planetary Hour, and what
Use may be made of them.
( from CoJey. )
I. In the hcrar of Tj take no voyage to sea, neither under­
take any long journey by land, for crosses will assuredly at­
tend, auo small success may be expected ; take no physic, en­
tertain no servant, for they will prove idle careless persons j
not good to put on new garments, or cut your hair, but this
hour is good to buy or take leases of houses or kinds, good to
buy any kind of grain, or to dig in the earth, or plow, not
good to borrow money in this hour, or to fall sick in, for it
threatens a long disease, and sometimes terminates in death.
It. In the hour of If, it is good to apply to ecclesiastical
persons, and all great men to obtain their favour, the same
from all grave senators, judges, lawyers, &c. In this hour ift
is good to take a journey in, or to go put o f the house w ith
success, good to sow all kind of seeds, or to plant, not good
to be let blood, he that falls sick in this hour will soou recov­
er, good also to lend or borrow monies, not good to enter a
ship, not good to buy beasts, to conclude, tbi$ hour is good
to contract matrimony in, &c.
III. In the hour of $ begin no worthy action or enterprize,
for it is a very unfortunate hour in all things, and therefor®
ought as touch as possible to be avoided$ *tis ill to take a jour­
ney, for you shall be in danger of thieves, very ill to take a
voyage to sea and generally in all things.
IV . The hour o f the 0 is ootto be chosen, As being ge­
nerally unfortunate, un e^s to make application to great per­
sons, not good to begin a building, or put on new garments,
not good to enter a man's own hou»c, for discontent and
brawling may then be expected to follow ; this hour is good

for a man t^ ^ ^ iv e preferment in $ not good to court the female
sex, or to lay down monies on any account; it i3 also very
dangerous for a person to fall sick in,
V. iu the hour o f it is good* to court women or to be-%
gin a journey, but not a vogage, good to enter on any play,
sport, or pastime, not good tb be let blood in, good to go out
of st man’s house with success, but not so good to return
•gam1
, good to take physic iu ; but if a man falls sick in that
horn:, the disease proceeds from some venereal distemper;
this hour is generally good to undertake any business relating
to womens concerns, or any delightful actions, not good to
begin a new garment, but singular good for marriage and
contracting in matrimony, & c.
VI. The hour of $ is very good to merchandise in, 'viz.
buy or sell, or to write letters, or to send messengers, to take
physic in, to send children to school, to begin a journey, to
lend or borrow monies in, to put forth apprentices, to*' begin
any building; but not good to contract marriage, ot to buy
houses or lands, or to re-enter your house being abroad, least
discontent or brawling arise, not good to take a servant to
hire, or reedeem a prisoner, but good to plant or graft in,
and finally to make suit to great persons.
V II. The hour of the 4 is not accounted good to buy
cattle in, especially of the smaller sorts, nor to take physic
in, or begin any building, not good to lend money in, or to
make new cloathes •, it is good to court the female sex in, or
send children to school, and in some cases to take a journey,
or to pursue an enemy j and to conclude you may make choice
of this hour to leave your native country in, (if designed to
travel,) but choose another hour when you return, and are
to enter into your own country again.

T o find the true place of each Planet at any hour when vrt
have occasion to erect a figure, it only requires to turn to the
Ephemeris for the Planets places at noon ; which being found,
note how many degrees or minutes they rtaave in the Zodiac,
by twelve o'clock the next da # or from noon the preceding
dqy, and then by the help of ths above tabie> it will be seen ho*

the celestia l in t e l l ig e n c e *. 147
how many degrees, minutes, or seconds they move in an
hour. For example, suppose a planet moves 1 degree in 2 4
hours, ow far does it move in 1 hour ? A t the top of the
first column is the figure I, and in the same line of these-
cond column, is 2 minutes and 30 secondsj which shews,
that ifa planet be 24 hours in moving 1 degree, it then moves
2 minutes and 30 seconds in an hour. Or suppose a planet
only moves 2 minutes in 24 hours, look into the first co-
fanso of the Table for the figure 2, opposite, in the second
cohm
Df stands 5 seconds, which shews, that if a planet
moves2 minutes ip 2 4 hours, it then only moves 5 seconds in
an hour* Again, if a planet*# diurnal motion be 1 1 minutes
what is its hourly motion > Look into the first column for
11, and opposite is 2 7 , 30$ which indicates, that if a planet
m
oves 1 1 minutes in 24 hours. It moves 2 ? seconds and 30
thirds iu an hour. The same rules are to be observed in the
motions o f all the planets; but let it be carefully remember­
ed, that if the diurnal motion of any planet be in degrees,
then you must enter the first column of the table under the
denomination of degrees, and the second column with mi­
nutes and seconds; but if the diurnal motion of the planet be
only in minutes, then you must begin to reckon in the first
column only with minutes, and in the second column with
seconds bnd thirds. This is indicated by the initial letters
placed over each column, which signify degrees or minutes
in the first column $ and in the second, degrees and minutes,
minutes and seconds, seconds and thirds. Then suppose a
planet moves 1 degree and it minutes in 24 hours, how far
does it move in a h o u r ? Refer to the Table and say,

1 4 8 THE CELESTIAL INTELLIGENCER.
1 Degree in 24 hours is 2 min. 30 sec. 0 thirds per hour.
1 1 minutes in 2 4 hoursis O min. 27 $ec. 30 thirds.
Answer 2 37 30
And thus any quantity of a planet’s diurnal motion, may be
reduced to time in the same manner.
But as no figure can be erected without the help ofan
Ephemeris, and Tables to shew the Sun’s place in each of the
Twelve Signs, unless by entering long and tediouscalcu­
lations, I shall therefore insert, in tiiis place, the right-band
page of an Ephemeris, for February, 1809, and tbs
Tables above-mentioned, with an explanation of the whole.

ami therefore it is necessary the young practitioner should
know how to rectify the daily motions of the Planets, by the
number of degrees they move every twenty-four hours, so as
toerect the Figure and introduce the true places of the Signs
and Planets whenever required. This, by refering to the
Ephemeris for the stations of the Planets at Noon, may be
doneextremely easy, by the common process of figures, but
that eveiy reader may be enabled to do it without trouble, I
haveinserted an easy Table, whereby the Planetary motions
arereduced to boors and minutes, and may be found for either
daypr night.
The use of the Ephemeris in setting a Figure, is to point
out the places of the Planets at Noon whenever required,
For this purpose we refer to the given day of the month, in
thefirst column of the right-hand page, and opposite to it in
the second column, is the Sun’s place or longitude that day
at noon. So also in the same line of the succeeding columns
through the whole Table, tire the places of the ,Moon, Sa­
turn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, as specified at
the top of each distinct column, and these are the true places
of the Sun, Moon and Planets, every day throughout the
year, precisely at twelve o’clock at noon. Therefore if the
Figure be erected before that lime, the diurnal motion of thp
Planets must be deducted in degrees and minutes, in propor­
tion to the rate they move at per hour 3 but if it be erected
after noon, «tben so many degrees or minutes must be added,
as w
iBl bring them to the precise time of.erecting the Figure.
The twelve Tables of Houses, are ne^t to beYefcred to j
and these are calculated to shew what degrees pf each Sign
possess the Cusps of the twelve Houses of Heaven, when the

Figure is erected. They begin with the Sun’s entrance into
the Sign Aries, and! Shews his progress through each degree
of thfe twelve Signs of the Zodiac.
N ow let it be Required by way of example, to erect a Fi­
gure for a child, born, on Wednesday, the first day of Feb­
ruary, T8O9, at l l h. l i m. A M . that is at eleven minute*
past eleven o’clock in the morning. To do this, 1 refer toth
e
first column of the right-hand page o f the Epfiemeris for
February, and opposite the first day of the month, in these­
cond colupin, which has £j*>'s longitude printed at the top,
is 12 18 25 with the Sign & prefixed at the side of thefirst
range o f figures. This indicates, that the Sun at twelve
o’clock that day, is lit twelve degrees, eighteen minutes, and
twenty-five seconds of Aquarius; but the minutes and se­
conds when less than thirty, are -Dejected, without sensible
error; and vfrhen more than thirty, have as many added ft
tfill make them up even degrees. I then turn to the Tables
of Houses, and iu the page entitled Sun in Aquarius, 1 look
for the column that has the Sign 22 at the top, which it
the third; I seek for twelve degrees, and in the cplomn on
the left side of it, entitled time from noon, I find even with
twelve degre- s, 20b. 58m . The hours and minutes tbos
found, are uniformly to be added to the time and hoar of tie
day when the Figure is erected, unless it be precisely at noon,
in that case^ as before observed, the places of the Sun, Pla­
nets and Signs are to be set down exactly as they are foundto
the Rphemeris and Tables of Houses. But the present Fi­
gure, being erected just forty nine minutes before twelve
o’clock, I am to add this time, reckoning from noon the pre*
ceding day, to the above 2Ch. 58m . and from these two •niw
added together, ! Subtract twenty-fotir hours, and therem

be curious in these speculations, should study the Celestial
Globe, and learn to be very expert in the use o f it, which is
most easily acquired and also very entertaining.
Now to know whether any of the fixed Stars fall intd the
Figure erected. I note the Sign and degree upon the Cusps
of the Houses, and then examine the 2nd. column of the fore­
going table of fixed Stars, and if I find either o f them ascend­
ing, or descending, within 5 degrees of the Signs upon the
Cusps of the several Houses, they are then to be entered in
the same manner as the Planets, and th$ir qualities and influ­
ences are to be duly weighed, according to the nature of what­
ever Planet they correspond with, which is shewn in the last
column of the table. In the foregoing Figure o f the Hea­

ant, then looking down the twelve Signs in order, in the 2nd.

also ascending, within 5 degrees of the Cusp of the lst% House

and in the table I find that eminent fixed Star, the Viigjn's
Spike, of the 1st. magnitude, in :& 21 3 , which I enter
near the Cusp of the 11 th. House, but not within the House
as before taught. Upon the Cusp of the 12th. is m 15 .5 4 ,
and in the table, I find the Star, North Ballance in HI 16 35,
and therefore J enter him in 16 degrees, 35 minutes o f H ,
in the J 2th. House* and thus 1 have collected the positions
of all the Planets and eminent fixed Stars, as they stood in
the Heavens at 24 minutes past 9 o'clock, on Sunday* the
3Cth. o f April, I 8O

But since the Aspects of the Planets at the time of erecting
the Figure, consitute the principal index of our judgment,
I examine their position in this respect, and note them down
under the title of the Figure, where they stand as a constant
guide to our judgment on Nativities, or the matter under
consideration : for instance, I examine the Figure before pro­
jected, and in the '/th. House I find 9 in 10 degrees, 30 mi­
nutes of Q ; and % in the 4th. in 10 degrees, 2^ minutes df
T ; 1 then reckon from 10 degrees of T to 10 degrees of8 ,
is 30 degrees* and from 1 0 degrees of g , to 10 degrees o f
Jl, is 30 degrees more j these amounting to 60 degrees con­
stitute a partile sextile aspect, which I note thus ?<*
Then I observe $ retrograde, in 1 1 degrees, 2 1 minutes q f
and 9 in 10 degrees, 30 minutes of n , and their dia-
tance from each other being reckoned as before, are found to
be near 120 degrees apart, which making a trine, they are
now within each others orbs, and are consequently in a pla-
fic trine, applying to a partile trine aspect, because 9 >• d
swifter Planet than and <J by retrogradation applies to 9 *
which 1 note thus, A ? <?• Then I observe % a lighter Pla­
net, separating from a trine of T?, yet still within each
others orbs, which I note thus, A T i b* Then I find as
before observed in 1 1 degrees, 2 1 minutes o f A , and % in
10 degrees, 27 minutes of T , which being opposite Signs,
sod the Planets degrees within each others orbs, constitute a
platic opposition, wherefore I note down this aspect
Lastly I find the ( in 22 degrees, 12 minutes of tt[ , and this
© in 1 0 degrees, 3 minutes of $ here the < is separating
ffom an opposition of the © . These being all the aspects,
I range them together under the title of the Figure, thus,
* ¥ 9 A 9 d A % h S O f . This Figure is erected

in the hour of the Sun,, as may be seen by refering to th
&
table of Planetary, I therefore signify it thus, © hor. and
the latitude under which the Figure is erected, beingthat of
Bath, I have allowed 10 minutes for the difference of tim
e,
and enter 5 1 ° 2 2 V that is fifty-one degrees, twenty-two m
i­
nutes north latitude. These aspects are not always arranged
in this manner, under the Scheme or Figure of birth; 1 have
only given this example by way of conveying instruction to
the young learner as the only true and exact method of pro*
jecting the Horoscope.
It is here necessary to explain what is meant by the polef
positions, and the equations of time. Suppose twelve great
circles, one of which is the meridian o f any given place, to
intersect each other in the two poles o f the Earth, and tocut
the Equator in every fifteenth degree, they will be divided by
the poles, into twenty-four semicircles, which divide the
Equator into twenty.four equal parts; and as the Earth turns
on its axis,, the plans of these semicircles come successively
after one another, every hour-to the Sun: and as in an hour
o f time, there is a revolution of fifteen degrees o f the Squa­
lor, in a minute o f time there will be a revolution of fifteen
minutes in the Equator, and in a second of time, a revolution
of fifteen seconds $ therefore to eveiy place fifteen degrees
eastward from any given meridian, it is noon an hour sooner,
than on that meridian, because their meridian comes to the
Sun an hour sooner, and to all places fifteen degrees west­
ward, it is an hour later, because their meridian comet an
hour later to the Sun •, and so On, every fifteen degrees of
motion, causing an hours difference of time, therefore they
who have noon an hour later than we, have their meridian,
that is, their longitude, fifteen degrees westward from us;

and they who have noon an honr sooner than we, hare their
meridian or longitude, fifteen degrees eastward from ours;
and so for every hours difference of time, fifteen degrees dif­
ference o f longitude*

I have introduced the foregoing Table of (he Latitude and
Longitude of the most considerable Towns in England,
(which will answer for any other places of birth that happen
pear them,) for the conveniency of Persons who may want
to calculate their own Nativity.
I shall now proceed to shew how a Planet in one Meridian
may be reduced to that of another.
Por example, suppose it were required to knew the differ­
ence between tiie Meridians of London and Bath ; refer to
the Epbemeris in this Work, page 14p, and on the 1st of
February, at twelve o'clock at noon Luna is in 23 degrees,
26 minutes of Leo, tinder the Meridian of London ; bnt to
deduce H to the Meridian o f Bath, pursue the following me­
thod. See by the foregoing table the Longitude of I/ondon,
19(1 it will be found, 2 3 ° 2 6* . »
Subtract the Longitude o f Bath, which is 20 55 ,
And there remains 2 3 1
with this difference, 2 degrees, 3 1 minutes, look into that
table for turning the degrees of the Equator into time, then
refer to table the second, by which it will be found, that 1
degree gives 4 minutes, and therefore 2 degrees, 3 ! minutes,
(the difference of the two Longitudes,) must give 10 m i­
nutes difference of time in the two Meridians; and as Bath
is situated west from London, Luna must be in 23 degreest
26 minutes of Leo, 10 minutes before noon at Path, and at
noon, according to her own motion in an hour, gives for that
time, (going at the rate o f 33 minutes, 2 seconds,) 5 mi­
nutes, 30 seconds, for the 10 minutes, wh!c i being adv cd

to 2 3 degrees, 2(5 minutes, make 2 3 degrees, 3 1 minutes and
30 seconds of Luna in Leo, at twelve o’clock at Bath,
and thus by proper attention to the preceding rules and direc­
tions, may any person, though of small abilities, erett the
llbroscope, and introduce the Signs; Planets and Stars, there­
in, at any given time required, but without the .Reader bat
ability to define from the aspects and pasitions of the Ptanets,
under whatever situations they may be fodnd, it will no^be
of any real utility to him j let him therefore turn to the fore*
going Figure of the Heavens, esected for the 30th. o f April,
]$0g> and endeavour to discover the cause aud manner of a
Chpd’S approaching dissolution, who from present appear­
ance, under the influx of such destructive rays, will no doubt
die in its infant state.
1 have here thought proper to introduce the Tables o f the
semidiurnal and seminocturnal Arches fof Ctery degree o f the
Ecliptic, for the Latitude of London,: wjuch being mostly
> amed, will o f epurse save the practitioner sb^e trouble.
1 have also added a Table of Ascensional Difterehqes under
the Poles o f the respective Houses, all which will bcNpund
exceeding useful in ascertaining the true time of birth, and
bringing up mundane Directions, as will be explained here­
after.

The Use ofthe foregoing Tables of Semidiurnal
and Semtnoclurnal Arches*
If you would find the Semidiurnal Arch of any Planet
above the Earth, refer to the Table of Semidiurnal Arches ;
for example, suppose it was required to find the Semidiurnal
Arch of Saturn in 9 degrees of Taurus, and Tanrus on the
Cusp of the 12th* House; look down the first column for 9,
against which in a right line under JJ h m, is 7 17, which
shews the Semidiurnal Arch of Saturn in 9 degrees of Tau­
rus is 7 hours, 17 minutes$ in the same manner you may
proceed for ai\y other Planet: but if the Planet is under the
Earth you must take his Seminocturnal Arch, which is the
space of three Houses, and if required is to be turned into
degrees of the Equator, by the Table in page 184, where
you will find in the two last columns, under Hours and Mi­
nutes 7 20, which is the nearest; (but the Learner must cal­
culate if he wants it exact,) against which on the left ham),
tinder degrees is 110, which shew that 110 degrees will give
the true distance of three Houses, and if divided by three, it
will give the proper distance of one House, by which me­
thod the true division of all the Houses may be obtained, ac­
cording to the-rules of Ptolomy > two of which parts make
a*sextile, his ykofe Arch a quartile, and four parts constitute
a;iriup, fur%
these are all aspects made in the World*

The Use of the Table of Ascensional Differences
of the Planets.
* The Ascensional Difference, is a certain arch o f distance,
|i *
between the right and oblique ascensions o f any Star or Pla*
r | aet inr any degree of the Ecliptic, and to find it by the fbre*
• going table of differences, observe the following rules. En«
t ter with the degrees of declination on the left hand of thd
j table, and under the Pole o f the House (as in the head,) in
3 * the common angle of meeting, with equation, will be found
I * the ascensional difference required. Example, suppose a
.p Planet to have 12 degrees of declination* and is required to be
•i brought to the eleventh House, under the Foie o f 23* degrees,
! 27 minutes $ I enter with 12 degrees on the left hand, undet
,, the pole o f 2 3 degrees, and there I find 5 degrees, eleven
\ minute*, but having 27 minutes more, I take the part propor*
f tional, between 23 degrees and 24 degrees, viz.
j; Declination 10 deegres with latitude < t 26
!* THE CELESTIAL INTELLIGENCER. 193

I « then I say by the rule of proportion, if 60 give 15, what
1 ! shall 27, the odd minutes of the Pole of the llth . House
| J five > It gives ^ nearly, which added to 5 degrees, 1 1 im-
5 nutes, gives the true ascensional difference, 5 degrees, 18
I minutes of the point sought^ ’
! Having obtained the ascensional difference, the use of it
? in the art of directions, is as follows. First, if the declina*
s tion be north, subtract the ascensional difference from the
) right ascension, and the remainder will be the oblique ascen-
l sion; but if you add irto the right ascension, the sum will

194 THE CELESTIAL INTELLIGENCE*.
be the oblique descension. Secondly, when the declination
is south, add the ascensional difference to the right ascension,
and the sum will be ‘ the oblique ascension but if you
subtract it from the right ascension, the remainder will be
|he oblique descension.
Having found by practice atfcf experience, that mundane
Parallels, from their wonderful operation, constitute the most
considerable directions in human life, I would therefore re­
commend them, for they will amply reward the young learn*
er for all his trouble in ascertaining a perfect knowledge o f
fhem.
Before any judgment can be given on * nativity, it is re­
quisite to be knowny whether the Native is o f a long or short
life, J have therefore selected the following general rule?,
SIGNS O f DEATH IN IN FA N C Y *
I. I f the birth be precisely o» *a N ew or Full Moon,
II. I f the Moon be in conjunction of Saturn and Mars, in
the $th. Sift, or 12th. House of the Figure.
•
• III. If the Moon be in quartile or opposition o f Saturn
or Mars in the 4th. House,
IV . I f the Moon be bepeiged by the Sun and Mars.
V . I f an Eclipse impede the Light of Tim e in the houf
of birth.
V I. If all the Planets be subterranean, and neither the
pun, Moon, nor Lord'of the Ascendant essentially fortified,
V II. If the two Malefics are conjoined in the Ascendant.
V III. If an Jnfortuoe in the Ascendant vitiate the degrees
thereof, qr by quartile or opposition*

IX. I f the Lord of the Ascendant be combust o f the -Sun
and at the same time Cadent and Retrograde.
X. If the t>rngon*s Head or Tail, be in conjunction of
Saturn or Mars itv th« 4lh.
These configurations, by long and invariable experience,
are found to destroy Life in Infancy, except the bencfic raya
of Jupiter or Venus interpose, ahd by joining in- the asplects>
tnodify*nd remit tbeir malignant effect.
Observe that Mara hath greater power o f destToyFngltfe
then posited in Aries and above the Elarth, m a diurnal N&i
tfvity 5 and Saturn, when posited- \h Capricorn and above
the ESarth, id a nocturnal Nafivkyl
SIGNS OF SHORT L IF E .
If the degree Ascending Sol or Luna ere extremely afflict­
ed, or either of them, it is an argument o f short life, and
therefore it wall be In vain to form long directions for such a
nativity. These points are said to be afflicted or unfortunate,
when either the conjunction, quartile or opposition of thd
Infortunes vitiate their places, or when many violent fixed
Stars of the nature o f the Lord of the 8th. ascend With the
degree ascending, or with the Luminaries.
The <[ besieged between t and (J argues Short Life.
SIGNS OF LONG L IF E .
I f the Lord of the Ascendant be essentially strong, free^
from the affliction of the Infortunes, not combust, nor re-
trogade, nor impeded by the Lord of the 4th, 6th, 8th, or
12th Houses, but encrcasing iu number, light, and motion,
it shews Ion - L ie.

Algol in 2 3 ,2 / 8 , Oculus {$ in 5 ,4 3 'fl, Hercules 20,30'$,
Right Shoulder of Orion in 25,5g'H, Cor n( in 6,15' J ,
Chaelaein 1 l ,l 5 ; ni.
First, both the Luminaries in violent Signs, not both it
one Sign, but in divers which behold not one another, por­
tend a violent Death.
The Lights are said to be in contiguous Signs when the.C
is in Y , and the © in IR, or the < in 2S, and the © in vf,
and so in the others.
Both the lum inaries with violent fixed Stars, and within

declare* a violent Death ; and then most certainly ^h en the
Lord of the Ascendant and o f the eighth is in d with either

These Rules then hold good, and take effect, when the
Lord of th Ascendant or of the eighth House is in d with
oue of the Lights; or when either the Sun or Moon hate
dominion in the first or eighth House.

If either the 0 or ( be in violent Signs, and the other of
the Lights with a violent fixed Star, it prenotes a violent
Death: but in this case it is necessary, that together with
this configuration, one of the Infortunes afflict either 0 oc
( , or the Lord of the eighth.
Secondly, both the Luihinariesunfbrtunated by T
? and 31
,
so that one of the Lights, and one of the Infortunes be in a
violent Sign, or with a violent fixed Star, portepd a violent
Death.
If both the Luminaries be afflicted only of ope pf the In­
fortunes, the other Infortune being impedited or posited in
a violent Sign, and having dignities in the eighth, it threat­
ens violent Death.
The 6 of 1} and <? in an angle, especially in the Mid-
heaven in a violent Sign, infesting only one o f the Lights,
threatens a violent Death.

monstrate violent Death.
The Lord of the first in a violent Sign, or infested of the
malevolents, and the disposiler of the Light of Time being
also in a violent Sign and afflicted, portends violent Death.
The Lord of the first in the eighth, being naturally an In-
fortune and afflicted besides, Scc. shews a violent Death. But
if he be not naturally a malevolent Planet* but is in a violent
Sign, and impedited by the □ or $ of the Malehcs, it por­
tends the same.
The Lords of the eighth and first House, being the dkpo„
sitors of either Light, and either of them in detriment and
fall, and one of the Infortunes afflicting the other Light ins
violent Sign, these shew a violent Death.
The ( in the 7th, in Signs where fixed Stars of a violent
nature are placed, viz. {J D[ ® f , and. in n or 8 of ©,
or an evil Planet posited in the eighth, or having dominion
therein, and both being in Signs violent, these are arguments
of a violent Death.
But notwithstanding all the preceedent Holes if to be ad.

But for the more perfect judging of (he quality, and b y

of eminent Authors, together with my own judgment such
Aphorisms, ~as they and myselfhave found true by experience*
RULES OF SATURN AMD MARS.
Saturn in X and the { in or I? in a watery Sign, and
the { in 8 to him, shews the Native will die by W ater,
viz. be Drowned, or else die by Drinking too much W ine.
Saturn in tit, in ri with <J, and the ( in malaftg ap­
plication to them, declare the Native wifi be suffocated Or
drowned.
Saturn in the watery triplicity, and the © conjoined with
him, either by d , Q , or $ , are great arguments of Drown*
ing, more especially in the eighth.
Saturn in the seventh, in $ to the © , or ( , shews death
by Imprisonment, Sluttiahness, Poison, Poverty, Fear, tor­
ments in a Dungeon, or by some violent Fall, or in exile, A c .
Saturn in the tenth House, in ^ to the Light of Tim e, de­
clares death by the fall of Houses, but if a watery Sign be
on the fourth, by Water.
Saturn and <J in the twelfth, imports death or dang
great Beasts.
Leo, or £ on the Cusp o f the twefth; and a Planet unfor­
tunate therein, signify the Native will receive a fall horn an
Horse and so die.
Saturn in $ in the eighth imports the same.
Saturn and $ in the seventh in a common Sign, and the
C in S to them, declares death by a sudden fall.
Saturn in the seventh with the $ J, declares hanging.
Observe, a benevolent Planet mitigates these judgments*

Mars in the seventh in feral Signs, such as & and the last
past of. $ , declares death by ruins, or fall o f Timber, or
Houses, or from falls by Beasts, or Horses.
Stars ihfitry Signs in n to ^ in HI, or H, denotes
death by scalding, or hot water.
In each o f these significations, you must have one, or both
of the Luminaries, In evil configuration, with him, ox other*
wile the judgment is but of small import.
Ag^in, if the Lord o f the Ascendant, or eighth be in $ to
the Ascendant the Native will die violently.

Excellent Aphorisms for guiding the Judgm ent
on M arriage.
You are to consider with judgment all the Significators
of marriage, namely, theyth house, its Lord, and Planet
posited in the 7tb, how they are affected, principally the C
• and 9 , if both these Planets be in barren Signs, viz. II SI
and also in cadent Houses, viz. 6th, 9th, 12th, or even in
the 8tb, these testimonies import either a single life, or an
averseness to marriage.
I f the Significators, “
but especially the g and 9> are not
so constituted; see then, if either of them is weak or little
fortified, conjoined to V he being very potent, 9 herself
alone, not having the support of any Planet by a good as­

pect, .and if you find the d posited in a barren Sign, or ca­
dent House, or extremely afflicted 5 these are arguments of
no marriage, nor any desire thereto. But in this judgment
you must always understand ^hat T? ought to be very strong;
for if $ and the d be more fortified than f?, then the pre­
ceding judgment holds not true.
So when in a nativity you find more elevated than ei­
ther the d or $ , and no Planet assisting either of them, you
may judge the Native's inclination for a single Life,
You must remember that the other significators of marri­
age are also to be examined, viz. whether they be in barren
Signs, or cadent Houses, or much afflicted, and in 6 with
Tj, and he well fortified 5 for if the testimonies of these sig-
nificatow agree with the affliction of the d and $ , without
doubt the Native will then never marry.
The. d in n i, in H of be in £ or 8 $ { combust o f
the © , and in n or S to if she is in yf, or A , the
Native never marries.
The 'U or $ of 9* and T? helps much to a single life; the
d as well as 9 being in a barren Sign, and cadent House,
and some of the other Significators either unhappily placed
in bad Houses or unfruitful Signs.

If the $ignificators be ^occidental o f the 0 , and in occi­

Besides this, observe the motion o f the Significators, for
if they be direct and swift in motion, they declare marriage
inyouth: but if they be retrograde, slow in motion, or sta­
tionary, they prolong the time.
The more special time is best adjudged from the directions

TESTIMONIES OP THE NUMBER OF WIVES.

so that either the ^ in the 7*h, in any Sign whatever, gives

the © : I must confess I never knew that the Native failed
of having a plurality o f female friends, (alias; a concubine,
or two) when the <[ was in the/ih, bm not always two W ives

The <
T coifjoined to one Planet only, whether by platick

when she is thus joined to only one Planet, and is more strong
than the Planet with whom she is ih aspect, the man out*
lives his W ife ; but* if the Planet to whom the<f is joined is
more powerful than tite J , the Husband diesbcforc the W ife.

I f those Planets so posited between the Mid-heaven and 9
shall suffer by retrogradation or combustion, and yet be in
their essential dignities, viz. either House or exaltation, or in
mutual reception of such dignities, then you may account
those Planets in the number, for Significators of a Wife or
Wives.
When these rules hold not, or use cannot be made o f them,
observe how many Planets behold the Lord of the 7 th, with"
a partile aspect, whether they be retrograde or combust, and
from thence determine the number of W ives.
T h e best approved method I have hitherto found by expe*
rience is this ; consider how many Planets there are in the

any
W ives may be hoped for, &c.
Observe this general rule about Wives, if the Significatorg
be weak, they argue Sweet-hearts and Wenches, or such cs
be m\y woo for Wives, rather than marriage itself: again,
if the tf apply to a Planet in a common Sign, it argues two
W ives : It* she be in a fruitful Sign, and apply to a Planet in
a fruitful or bicorporal Sign, it argues three W ives: if toge­

2 3 4 ' THE CELESTIAL INTELLIGENCER.
I f Rich, contrary to the redes of the Ancients I constantly
observe this way, to examine the strength of the eighth
House, the Lord thereof, and Planet or Planets posited there-
in, and according to their position and fortitade, so I judge;
for if these Significators be strong, and free from malevolent
aspects, they argue a rich Husband, and so on the contrary.
I f the Lord of the eighth be in* his own House, and angular,
I never fear the Husband’s estate.
T h e agreement is discerned from the Significators of Mar­
riage being in mutual reception, or in ^ or £ to one onother,
or in good aspect with the Fortunes, they then shew unity:
contrary aspects, and the Significators in the 12th, 6th or
8th, portend no concord.
Aphorisms fo r determining Issue*
The t and £ in the 5th, and the Lord of the Sign and
Signs wherein they are, free from all manner of impediment,
denotes many Children.
Mercury being oriental, in good aspect with the Fortunes,
for then he participates of their nature, shews many C bil- j
dren; but if occidental, and in configuration with thelnfor-
tnnes, be then denotes Barrenness.
Luna in the 5th promises Children, but if h be therein
in the same House, they will prove ill-conditioned.
I f the Sign of the 5th, sign wherein the Lord of the 5th
is, and sign ascending be prolific, many Children are prom­

Some short Rules fo r the making o f Elections,
upon several occasions.
An Election is the choosing of a fit and proper time for
theobtaining a thing promised, or for the beginning of any
enterprize. In the performance of which we ought tocon­
sider the Party’s Nativity, if it can be possibly obtained; for
without it (as Mr. Coley saith, in his C l a v is A stbo lo gj.*
E l im a t a , page 2J 6) it is in vain for any person to constitute
an Election; for in an ill Geniture no good Election caft

T H E C E L E S T I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E R . 2 3 7
b e expected; for if the House from which the Election is
required in the Person’s Nativity, be unfortunated by the
malevolent Planets, or the Lord thereof beweak or afflicted,
although the Significators of the Figure in the Election be
well posited, yet there is little hopes of good success in that
Election.
As for example j we see that two Persons setting forward
in a longJourney, or Sea Voyage, both at one and the same
time, and consequently under the same position of the Hea-
N vens, and yet one hath good Success and a happy Jour­
ney or Voyage, the other an unfortunate one, or perhaps
dies by the way. This must certainly be predicted from
theirNativities, and not fromthe elected time of the under­
taking their Voyages. These things .being considered, I
proceed to thatwhich I intend to write of Elections.
In the beginning of any enterprize, be sure to fortify the
Moon, and that Planet which was Lord of the Ascendant
and, if possible, let either the Moon or Lord of the Ascen­
dant, beposited in the Ascendant, in your Electional Figure.
That is accounted a good Election, when that Sign ascends
which was posited on the Cusp of the Ascendant in the Per­
son’s Nativity i provided it be not unfortunated by the pre­
sence of molevolent Planets, or fixed Stars of their nature,
orby the Dragon’s Tail. If you would Elect a time for any
thing of longcontinuauce, place a fixed Sign upon theAs­
cendant, provided that it was not. afflicted in the Person’s^
Nativity, nor upon the Cusp of the 8thor 12th Houses. Be
careful that you place not fixed Stars of amalevolent nature
B» 3

2 3 8 T H E C E L E S T I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E R .
uponthe Cusp ofthat House from which you intend to make
your Election.
2. When you make an Election for receiving of Money,
or any thing relating to the second House, fortify that Planet
which was Lord of the Ascendant in the Nativity, and also
Jupiter who is a natural Significator of Riches, &c. and if
possible, let either of them be placed in the 2nd, or inagood
place of the Figure, free from combustion, or other afflic­
tions, and ingood aspect to the Fortunes that beheld tjie 2nd
House or Lord thereof, by any good aspect in the Nativity.
3. In all things relating to the third House, especially for
short Journies, fortify the Ascendant andits Lord, and the
Moon and herDispositor; and also the Part of Fortune, and
the third House, and the Lord thereof$ and let Planets be
placed in the third which were fortunate in the Nativity, or
ingood aspect to-the Lord of the third in the Radix; andbe
careful that you place not those Planets in the third which
were Lord's of the 12th, 8th, or 7th, Houses in the Par­
ly’s Nativity. Thenyou ought to consider what theJourney
is intended for, whether to receiveMoney, to seek for tome
place of preferment, &c. and fortify that House and Lord
thereof, which is the Significator of the Business you go
about
When you makean Electionconcerning friendshipbetween
brothers, kindred, or neighbours, &c. let the Lord of the
Ascendant in the Nativity be well fortified in the Election*
and if you can, let him appl/ to some good aspect of the
Lord of the third5 or if the Lord of the Ascendant and
Lord of the 3rd be in reception and well posited, it shews a
good Election.

4. In Elections belonging to the4th House, as concerning
the buying or taking of aHouse, Lands, or Tenements, frc-
yod are to fortify that Planet which was Lord of the 4th in
the Geniture, and also the 4th House itself, together with the
<t, and let her apply to agood aspect of the Significators,
If you constitute an election concerning hiddpn treasure,
you ought first to view the Party's nativity, and consider if
there be any probability of the Native being fortunate in find­
ing hidden treasure 3 and if you find the Lord of theascend­
ant and Lord of the 4th well posited in the Radix, and in
good aspect to each other, it is an argument that the Native
will be fortunate in finding hidden treasure 3 and when you
intend to search for it, fortify the Lord of the Ascendant and
the 4, and the4th House andLord thereof, and let them ap­
ply tosome benevolent aspect 3 also let the Iqfortunes be ca­
dent, and thebenevolent Planets positedin angles.
5 . In Electtons appertaining to the 5ih House, viz. gam­
ing, or speculating in the lottery, you are to fortify the Lord
of the 5th in the Radix, and if you can, place the Sign of
the 5th in the nativity upon the Cusp of the 2nd in the elec­
tion 3 let % or 9 behold the Cusp thereof, or be posited
therein. Be careful that the ascendant and its Lord be no
ways afflicted3 and debilitate the 7th House and its Lord, so
much as you can.
6. In making Elections for. taking of servants 3 fortify the
g, and let her befree from all afflictions, and let the Lord of
the ascendant, or Lord of the 2ndin theRadix be in good a*-
pect to the Lord of the 6th 3 or let the fortunate Planets be
posited in the 6tb, provided they were Lords of good House8

ful Sign it isan argument of many children5 but in all mar­
riages let tbe ( be increasing in light, and free from com­
bustion.
8. In Elections for receiving your Wife’s portion, fortify
the asoendant andLord thereof, and let the Lord of the 8th
apply to any good aspect of the Lord of tbe ascendant, or
Lord of tbe 2nd; and if they do not behold each other, let
thembe in mutual reception. But for settling an estate, or
making of wills and testaments that they may continuelong,
let the C be increasing in light, and slow in motion, and let
the Lordof the ascendantand the <
[ applyto a + or A of 1?.
9. In Elections for taking long journies, consider if the
gth House or Lord thereof were not afflicted in the Radix';
andlet him be well fortified in theelection, andfree from the
malevolent beams of the Infbrtunes ; and let the Lord of the
9th be in good aspect to theLord of theascendant, or posited
in the ascendant in good aspect of theFortunes.

ting up any trade or profession, let the Cusp of the 10th

1 1 . In Elections appertaining to the 12 th House, in enter*
ing into leagues of friendship* let the Lord of the 1 1 th in the
Radix be well posited in the election^ Figure, and free from
all afflictions; also fortify the t , let her be strong in her es­
sential dignities, and in good aspect to the fortunes.
1 2 . In Elections for bnying horses; or great cattle, let the
Lord of the ascendant, and { be free from afflictions, and in
some of Jheir essential dignities, and in good aspect to the
Lord of the 12th in the Radix; also let him be fortified and
. free from afflictions.
These rules being but rightly understood, the ingenious Ar­
tist may from hence constitute an Election upon any occasion*
and by these short rules discorer many more.
Before I enter upon the management of Nativities, it will
not be improper.in this place, to give the rules, by which
the Reader may be enabled to ascertain the kind of Person
each Planet represents when significator in all or any of the
tw elve signs of the Zodiac. By the help of these, it is easy
to determine what kind of person the new born babe will be
w hen it arrives to the years of maturity; and we can also by
the same means, as truly describe the stature, complexion,
make, and disposition of a person we never saw, provided the
true time o f birth be previously known. These rules are
therefore absolutely necessary to be well understood by every
person who is desirous of calculating a Nathity.

Brief Observations in forming Judgment from the
Planet that is Lord of the Ascendant.
1. If no Planet aspect the Lord of the Ascendant, then
judge by him, not considering the Sign he is in.
2. But if he be retrograde, or in his detriment, or fall,
judge by the Sign he is in.
3. I f the Lord of the Ascendant behold the Ascendant,
judge by the Sign ascending.
4. Lastly, if two Planets aspect the Ascendant, take him
that beholds it most partile, or he that is in bis own House
before a Planet in his exaltation,
Note. These things are to be considered as well in the
conditions and qualities of the mind, as in the description
and make of the body.

Some Professors,' have endeavoured to give a probable con­
jecture what Christian Name the Party enquired of is, whether
man or woman. First they consider the Planet who is princi­
pal Significator of the Party enquired of, whether he be an­
gular or no, and then whether he be in aspect (it matters not
what aspect, good or evil) with any Planet or Planets * if he
be in no aspect, then in whose Dignities he is, and from
hence they make their mixture; for example, let us admit
$ to be Lord of the 7th, and Significator of a Maid's Lover,
and he in aspect, or in the dignities of <J, I shall then have
recourse to the Table before, and there I find in the first line
over against $ and (J Matthew, J shall then say the Man's
name is Matthew, or of a name equivalent in length, or the
game number o f letters : for my part I never use this way,
n or yet have much credited it 5 yet I believe, were it well
practised, yre might find out very pretty conclusions, and go
neat to find the very name, or somewhat near it

the nature and quality of the Signs and Planets, before any

pendence to hi&dispositer. Any Plainet strong in agood House, .
is of good signification, but much better if the Planet be a
fimonate one by nature.
A malefic Planet weak in the 10th House, denies honour,
if he beholds either tike Cusp or the Lord thereof by any
makfolent aspect, then many impediments or obstructions
prejudice or hinder the Native's advancement. $ strong in
the Mid-heaven, usually portends military preferment, dig-
*Uy, or profession.

nate Planet be in his own House, yet he partakes something
of the nature of the Malefic, with whom he is conjoined.
Three Planets or more in d , act jointly and severally ac­
cording to their respective natures, and to their heavenly
states, but principally according to the nature and state of
the most strong and ruling Planet. If an Infortune, (especi­
ally I?,) be placed between two Planets which are in <f, he
prevents or retards the good promised by the other two Pla­
nets ; the nature or kind theieof is discovered by the House

ing benevolent by nature, their virtues are the more powerful.
Many Planets in cardinal Signs in any Geniture, always ef­
fect some great things; if in one House, the Native receives
or suffers an excess of good or evil, according4
to the nature
of that House. The benevolent Planets %, 9 and 9 also,
retrograde in any Nativity, is of eminent import, adding to
the felicity of a Native, and this is (he more powerful if they

WHAT 18 A NATIVITY ?
'A Nativity or Geniture is the exact moment of birth, or
time of a Child’s coming into the world: at this moment the
Stars begin to act and operate in their influence upon their
new born infant, by the power or intervention of those An­
gels who rule and govern the constellations then level with
the Horizon, or that ascends upon the horoscope. St. Jerome
in his comment upon the xviiith Chapter of St. Matthew,
says, great is the dignity of souls, for every man from his
first rising and appearing under the Stors in his Nativity, hath
an Angel delegated to him for his Custody or Safely.
From these configurations we are enabled to point out
the incidents of the Natives future lire, but it is necessary
E %2 »

272 THE C ELESTIA L I N T E L L IG E N C E R .
that the exact time of birth should be well ascertained, in
order to be correct aod certain in these speculations. It is
well known that the celestial bodies'are in perpetual mo­
tion, and therefore every quarter of an hour must considera­
bly vary their position ; as does also different parallels from
any one given point of the Heavens5 and hence it is that the
latitude, as well as the true time of birth is absolutely neces­
sary in calculating or bringing up the directions of a Nativity.
IIozo to rectify a N ativity by the Animoder o f
Piolom y.
T o rectify by the Animoder of Ptoloroy, erect the figure
as near as possible to the estimate time of birth, and consider
in what Sign, and in what degree of that Sign, the new
Moon happened thatla«t preceded the birth; or if a full Moon
more nearly preceded the time of birth then a new one, then
note* the degree of the Sign wherein either of the Luminn-
jries were posited, that were above the earth, blit if one of
the Luminaries be exactly rising and the other setting, pre­
fer that which is rising. Then observe which of the Planets
hath most dignities by House, exaltation, triplicity, term, or
configuration, in the degree of such preceding new Moon,
or in the degree of the Luminary above the earth, or that
ascends at such preceding full M oon; and also what Sign
and degree then ascends upon the Horizon, or that culminates
.orpossesses the Cusp of the 10th House; and if the de­
gree of the Planet, dignified as above, be situated nearer
the degree ascending, than to the degree culminating, place
the same degree in number of the Sign ascending, up-

ott the Cusp of the Ascendant, that such ruling Planet pos­
sessed of the Sign he was in. But on the contrary, if the
Planet be nearer the degrees on the cusp of the 10th House
or Medium-coeli, than to the Ascendant, then the degree
culminntihg, or possessing the cusp of the mid-heaven, must
be made the same with the degree the said Planet was in, and
so according to the Sign and-degree thus ascertained, must
the other Houses o f the figure be varied, and this will be the
true time of the Native’s birth. But it it should happen that
two Planets have equal dignities in the degrees aforesaid, pre­
fer that which is posited nearest to the Ascendant. Ptolomy
further observes that what Sign the Moon is in at the time of
birth, is the very Sign which ascended at the conception 5 and
again whatever Sign the Moon is in at conception, that or
the opposite, will be the Sign ascending at birth.
To rectify a Nativity by Mundane Parallels and
Transits o f the Planets on the Cusp o f cither
o f the Th^ee Prim e Angles*
The shortest, easiest and most simple way of rectifying a
anativity, provided the estimate does not exceed two hours of
-the real, is as foliow*r
Having erected the figure to the estimate time, observe
whether either of the Luminaries be posited in the centre of
any one of either o f the three prime angles, namely, the A s­
cendant, Medium-cceli, or 7th House, or near them, and*
i f so bring other of them to the cusp of the angle, and the
degree and minute they were in, is the true time of birth;

but if neither of these are found thus centrichlly posited, nor
near the cusps of either of those angles, then bring them to
a right parallel from angles, and that will be the true tim e;
Jf their positions will not admit of this, observe the two bene,
he Planets % and %> and note whether either of theta, are si­
tuated as above specified, namely in the centre of the angles
or near them, or in a right parallel with either of the Lumi­
naries, that is to say, with the © by day, or the { by night}
and either of these brought to the cups as before, will give
the true time of birth. So likewise either of the malefic
Planets T? and <J, if found posited in the centre of the angles
or near their cusps, or iu parallel to either of the Luminaries
as above, will be the prQrogator of life, and likewise shew the
true time of birth by bringing either of them to the cusp of
the angle as before mentioned, but these last positions are
rarely if ever found in the schemes of grown persons nativi­
ties, because their influences if not corrected by the rays of
benevolent Planets, are of so destructive, tendency that
they generally cut ofF life in a sfiort time, either in infancy,
or at least in the first stage of life, an example of this me­
thod of rectification may be seen iu the following figure.

friends, death Ofchildren. In the 12lh, sorrow, trouble, im­
prisonment, and persecution by private Enemies. These are
the common effects of I?, when significator, and weak or
meanly dignified.*
Jupiter in the 1st, gives a good happy, and long life, just
and honest. In the 2nd, profusion of riches. Iii the 3rd,
friendship of brethren, and fortunate journies. In the 4th,
lands and inheritances, with an honourable life and end. In

Star, but if either of the benevolent (as Jupiter or Venus) behold him
with a good aspect, they take away his malignity, giving those things
which Saturn denies, being sc placed by night, but Saturn by night is al­
ways evil, especially if unfortunate in any of the Angles, and signifies
much evil to the Native, for he killeth the wife, destroyeth the chil­

O f the measure o fsTim e in D irections.
There are several opinions respecting, the measure of time
in directions, bat the opinion of Ptolomy hath continued
since his time until this last age without any contradiction;
* It was thus: I f you would direct the Ascendant in any N a­
tivity, yon mat perform it by the oblique Ascensions, for the
latitude of the placoof birth: the words of Ptolomy lib. 4 capf.

must therefore for thesake of brevity omit them.
H ow to Equate the Arches o f D irection, whereby to
ascertain the length o f Time in which the Events
denoted by themy w ill be in coming to pass.
T h e art of bringing up the Directions of a Nativity, from
the difuse which this science has for some years past fallen in-
.to, is amatter that has puzzled most of its present followers;
and the method of equating these directions when found, by
a measure that shall in'all cases correspond to truth and na­
ture, has been the subject of many controversies and disputes
among modern Authors, arising I conceive, from their igno­
rance o f the plain and genuine' system handed to us hy the
immortal Ptolomy, and from a want of reflecting that the re­
solutions ofall the Heavenly Bodies, as well as the periods of
all earthly events, are only reducible to one universal stand-
ard measure of time, viz 0 ’s geocentric motion in the Eclip­
tic. It is therefore surprizing that so many inventions should
have arisen, and so many errors in consequence adopted, in
equating directions, since it must be evident to the most un­
lettered mind, and a fact beyond the reach of contradiction,
that the same rule which estimates the days, months, and
years o f a,M an’s life, from the moment of his birth, like­
wise estimates the progressive motion, iti days, months, and
years, o f every Luminary within our cognizance, in the vast
extent of space. This rule is uoihing more than the Sun’s

3 l 6 T H E C E L E S T I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E R .
apparent progres* through every degree and minute o f the
Ecliptic, measured by the degrees of the Equator; to which
unerring standard every matter that refers to any description
or portion of time, must be ultimately brought, or all our la­
bour and accuracy will prove abortive.
Now when the true arch of direction is found by the fol­
lowing rules in the Nativity o f W . C. and is to be equated,
take the right ascension of the 0 ’s place at the time o f birth,
which may be found in the 1st column o f the table o f Houses
answerable to the 0 *s place, and add the arch o f direction to
the O ’s right ascension; with this sum enter the Tables o f
right ascension j and find what degree and minute of the
Ecliptic in the 3rd column answers thereto j then take the
Ephemerit tor the year of birth, apd note how many days
and hours the 0 will be, from tne time o f birth, in cemiog
to that degree and minute of the Ecliptic; and for every per­
fect day, which is twenty-four hours, account a year, and for
every two hours over and above the even days a month, and
so in proportion for minutes, and seconds of time, and the
arch of direction will be truly equated, as will be shewn by
some examples, in equating the directions of the following
Nativity,
And though jt be admitted that a student may make great
advances in the knowledge of futurity, by acquiring an ade­
quate comprehension of the nature and effects of the various
configurations of the Celestial Bodies, and of their particu­
lar influences bath benefic and malefic upon the human race,
and though we may by this means attain to know that such
and such events will certainly come to p a * y yet even this ao

T H E , C E L E S T I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E ! ! . 3 1 7
quisiton in the science must be considered very incomplete,
without the ability of pointing out, by some fixed and cer­
tain rule, the precise time when these events shall happen.
This grand acquisition is therefore not obtained by any other
mode, than by bringing up the arch of direction of each respec­
tive Significator in tb? Natives figure of birth, to the as­
pect, which denotes each, respective event $ and this arch
of direction is nothing more than the track or circle in the .
Heavens formed by the Significator, in moving from that
particular point in the Heavens where found at birth, to the
precise point where he forms the aspect with the prom'ttor
that indicates the event, which, upon his arrival there, is to
happen. It is consequently apparent that if this trtick or circle
can be found, and its degrees and minutes accurately taken,
and reduced into common time according to the motion of
the © , which regulates all our accounts of time, it will shew
us at one view the exact time when the event according to
the common course of nature, shall infallibly come to pass.

Judgm ents to be inferred from Revolutions•
T h e judgments of a Revolution are easy to be determined,
b y considering in what House and Sign in the Revolution the
Radical Signifrcatom are posited ; for according to those Re-
vqlutional positions and configurations we are to judge. So
that if the Lord of the 2nd House be in the 3rd, it shews
-gain to come either by travel, kindred or neighbours ; and if
it be also in * or A with the Lord of the 3rd, in the Radix the
same j if with the Lord of the 4th, by the father; if in the
Medium-cceli, or in 6 , or A with his Radical Lord,
gain by trade, office, preferment, Noblemen, or eminent
persons. Hence it appears, that the significator of sub-
stanc in a Revolution, is not Lord of the 2nd, in a Revolu­
tion, but the Lord of the 2nd, in the Radix \ the significa­
tor o f lands is not the Lord of the 4th, in a Revolution, but
the Lord of the 4th, in the Radix ; the same is to be under­
stood of the rest; but if the same Sign which Ascended Ra­
dically, Ascends in a Revolution, its effects will be the more
firm, because the Significators are the same ; the like, if the
same Planets which were Lords of the several Houses in the
Radix, be Lords of the same in the Revolution, though they
possess not the same Sign.
Whatsoever good or evil is presaged unto the Native, ei­
ther by Direction, Transif or Revolution, we are to measure
the greatness thereof, according to the Radical strength of
the Significators, compared with their strength or fortitude at
the time of Direction ; where if they are Radically strong,
the good or evil will be great and permanent, and this is
Digi " j O O g l C
T H E C E L E S T I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S .
more confirmed if they be also strong at the time of Direc­
tion or Transit; if Radically weak, the good ore\i) will bat
meanly manifest itself; and scarcely at all, if weak at the
time of the Direction or Transit; but if Radically weak,
and strong at the time of the Direction or Transit, the effects
thereof may appear much Beyond the expectations of the
Native, but will not be very durable.
PTOLOM Y’S SY ST O L
Having now introduced the Argclian system and briefly
explained the signification of directions, levolutiotis and tran­
sits, it might here be of the greatest utility, to give the young
learner the rales laid down by the great Ptolomy.
OF THE SPACE OF LIFE*
' i
Of the events which happen after birth, ,the chiefest is a-
bout the space of life: for how shall any other event which
befals after the birth, be considered in him that doth not a t
all arrive to that age of .life ? therefore the doctrine concern­
ing the space of life is chief of all : and this is not simple n o r
easy,,but is diversely taken from the dominion of the princi­
pal places : and the manner which chiefly pleaseth us, is thus.
That the whole concerning the space of life, depends on the a-
phetic places,* rulers thereof and disposition ofAnaretic places.
* The Aphetic, H yle-iacaland Promontory pkn.es are nil the sa m e:
the first from the Creek, the second from tte Hebrew, and the la t from
the Latin; and are the places whence the Aphcta, Hvleg or Prorogater
(which are all one) i3 taken: ami the Anaretic Places or Stars, are suck
as are killing.

First, the Prorogatory places are to be supposed those in
which the Star is that must assume the Dominion of Proro­
gation, both the Sign which is about the Horoscope from five
degrees ascending above the Horizon, unto the twenty five
remaining degrees, which being angular succeed, and also
the + Dexter of those thirty degrees which are of the good
Demon, and the O of the Mid-heaven above the earth, and
the A» which is called G o d , and the opposite of the west*
And among these again are prefered as stronger and more
powerful, first they which are in the Mid-heaven above the
earth, then they in the east, next to those they in the Succed-

The Oblique Ascensions and Descenstohs you may find

right distance of the Planet, what will 9 0 :degrees o f the
‘Equator give ? and the Quotient apply to the Right Ascension
of the meridian. ‘
If the Planet be between the Ascendant and the Mediura-

what House the © is, and how far from its cusp. Then take

but if the Ruler of the Lights possess the more principal place,
and hath Prorogative of Dominion in both conditions, he

THE W AYS OF PROROGATIONS
The Prorogator being so determined, we ought to ad­
mit two ways taf Prorogation: one of which is made on­
ly on the consequent Signs, tinder that which is called A ct-
inobolia, o r a projection of Rays, when the Prorogator is in
Oriental places, that is, in the places from the Mid-heaven
to the Horoscope. This therefore we ought to assume, and
not only this which is to consequenl Signs, put also to the
precedent Sign s; according to that which is called Horimea,
which is when the Apheta is in places declining from the Mid-
heaven.
These things being so, there are interficient degrees accord­
ing to the prorogation which is made to the precedent Signs.
The degree of the Occidental Horizon only is interficient, be­
cause it destroys the Lord of Life. But the other degrees of
the Stars so occuring or testifying, subtract them from
or add them to the collected numbers, until the Proro­
gator is set : but observe also that they do not kill,
It L

because they are not carried to the Aphetic place, but that ra­
ther to their places.
The Benefics therefore add, and the Malefics subtract $ but
£ is adapted to those by whom he is beheld. The situation
of the degree of each, indicates the number o f addition or
subtraction 5 for how many shall be the horary times o f the
degree of each, such shall be the number of years : but by
day, the times of the diurnal parts, by night the nocturnal
must be considered $ but this ought to be observed when they
are in the Ascendant.* Afterwards to subtract according to
the proportion of distance, until they coming Co the wast,
nothings remains#
But the placet of the Malefics T) and # k ill according to
the prorogation made to the following Signs, when they either
meet bodily or cast their rays from any where, whether it be
n o r <?, and sometimes in ifc's, proceeding front Signs obe*
dient or beholding, because of their equipolencc, and also a
n configuration from the following Signs to the Aphetic
place 3 and, also >a ^ evilly-affected, when it is in Signs o f
Long A scen sio n yea and besides, the A in Signs of Short
Ascension kill, as will the solar place, 4if.the ( b e H y le g :
and the rancounters made in such a prorogation can kill or
save, because such occursces are carried to the Aphetic
place direct.
These places are not always Anaretic, bnt only when they
• Bat says Cardan, when his number is in the Ascendant it ought ft

arc evilly affected; and their Anaretic part i* impeded, when
it falls in the terms of a Benefit-, or if any of the Benefics
cast a O , A i or <£, to the very Anaretical point, or to those
which follow it. In % not above 12 degrees, and in 9 not
above 81 Or if both the body of the Prorogator and the oc"
curent part have not both the same latitude.
Therefore when the Assisting or Anaretic Rays are found
two or more on each side, you must observe which is strong­
est in power and number •, in number when some exceed
others in multitude : in power when the assisting or killing
Stars are some of them in proper places, and others not$ and
chiefly when some of them are Oriental, and spme Occiden­
tal : for generally none of these that are under (he © beams'
are to be left either to kill or save, unless when the <( is
Aphe^a, the place of the © afflicted by some Mdleflcs joined
to it, and receiving freedom from none of the Bcneflcs, caus­
ed) death.
The number of years arising from the distance between the
Aphetip and Anaretic place, is not taken simply and indis­
creetly, always from the Ascensions of the times of each Pla­
net, but then only when the Orient possesseth the Proroga­
tion, or some other which ariseth ip the Oriental Horizon.
For there is one scope alone proposed to him that would na­
turally copsider after how many Eqinoctial times the place o f
the following body or ray cometh, to the place of that which
precedeth in theGeniture, because the Equinoctial times equal­
ly pass Horoscope and Mid-heaven, according to both

which, the likenesses of the local distances are taken, and
each time signifies a solar year.
Therefore seeing those things are so, it is fit when the A-
phelic and precedent place be in the Oriental Horizon, that
the Ascensions even to the meeting of the degrees be taken
for the Anareta after so many Equinoctial tiroes cometh to the
Aphetic place? that is to the Oriental Horizon ; but when the
Aphetic place is found in the Mid-heaven, we ought to take
all the Ascensions in a right sphere: in which Ascensions tztb
section passeth the Mid heaven.
But when the Aphetic place is in the Occidental Horizon,
we ought to take theDescensions in which each degree of the
distance is carried down, that is, in which the degrees oppo­
site to them are carried upwards.
But when the Aphetic and preceding place is not in these
three mentioned limits, but in some space between the times
o f these Ascensions and Descensions, or Culminations, they
do not carry the following places to the precedent, but others;
for the places are like the same which have have one position,
and is in the same degrees in respect to the Horizon and M e­
ridian : but this happens to them which are situate nearest to
one of the Semi-circles described by Sections of the Meridian
and Horizon; each of which Semi-circles according to the
same situation, maketh the temporal hours very equal.
Therefore, as it is carried by the same places, it comes to
the same position both of the Horizon and the Meridian;
end maketh the times unequal and diverse, by the transit of
the Zodiac : and in the same manner according to the posi-

tioqs o f the other distances it maketh transits, by times un­
equal to them : but we hive one method, that if the Apheta
and precedent places have an Oriental position, or Meridional
or Occidental, or an/other from the analogy of the times,
which are brought to the Aphetic places, we take the follow­
ing place. The way is thus.
Taking the degree of the Zodiac which is on the Mid-hea-
cn, and the precedent, and also the subsequent $ first we con*
aider what position the precedent degree hath, and how ma-
py unequal hours it is distant from the Meredian, and num­
bering the Ascensions of right sphere, which we find be­
tween the considered and the precedant degree, and the Mid­
heaven, whether it he above or under die earth, we div ide
theon into the number of horary times of the precedent de­
gree* either diurnal or nocturnal. But if it be above the earth,
diurnal j if under the earth, nocturnal j seeing the sections
o f the Meridian are distant from the Zodiac, the same hora­
ry times they arc contained under one and the same Semi­
circle* Then we enquire after how many Equinoctial times
the following sections or place is distant so many equal tem­
poral hours, from the same Meridian as the precedent degree
is distant from it. And assuming these, w e consider again,
by the Ascensions of a right sphere, how many Equinoctial
times, according to the position from the begining, the fol­
lowing degree was distant from the degree of the Mid-hea­
ven, and how many it was distant when it made the equal
temporal hours in the precedent 5 and multiplying these into

the number of horary times of the following degree; if they
be above the earth, of the diurnal $ if under the earth, of
the nocturnal; and assuming the times arising from, the ex­
cess of both distances, we hare the number of years sought
after.
Note here that no Converse Direction kills but that o f the
Hyleg or Prorogator to the Cusp of the 7th.
A ll the Directions of the Hyleg to Mundane (not to Zodr-
cal) Rays, which' happen between it and the 7th, are to be
calculated, and the Arch of Directions to the Benefic*# rays
are to be added together, and so are the Ach of Directions of
the Malefic aspects: and the sum of the Beneflc rays are to
be added to, but of the Malefic’s subtracted from the Arch of
Direction of the Prorogator to the Cusp of the 7th, and the
result is the true Arch of direction, according to Ptolemy,
which most certainly kills, if no Bcnefic ray assist.
o r RICHES.
W e will take those things which concern possessive For­
tune, from that point called the © alone, according to which
we cast away the distance from the © to the t from the Ho-
rosoepe, alike in things that are by day and by night. This
being supposed, we will take the Lordship, and consider the
strength of them, and their familiarity, and also o f those
that are configurated with them, or elevated, whether they
be of the same or contrary condition.
They therefore which assume the Lordship of the © , be*
ing in strength, cause much riches, and chiefly when the

Lights give proper testimony to them. But T? will increase
riches by building, husbandry, or navigation \ % by protec­
tion, or by those thing that were committed in trust to him,
or by priesthood: $ by warfare and general-ship : 9 by
friendship and gifts of women : 9 by eloquence and business.
Saturn having familiarity with the ® , and in configuration
with %> properly causeth hereditaments, and chiefly when
this is in superior Angles, % being Occidental, in a double*
bodied Sign, or expecting the <[ ’• application, for then be­
ing adopted, they will be the heirs o f others: and if they
which are of the same condition with the Lords, give testi­
mony of dominion, the possession will remain with them :
but if they which are of the contrary condition are elevated
above the principal places or succeed', the possession will not
endure r but the general times is taken from the inclining of
the Stars, which produce the cause to the Angles and Sue-
cedants.
I f the Significator of Riches be angular, the riches will be acquired
in youth, if near the Cusp, very early $ if in succedants, in middle age ;
in cadents, late, and in old age. The same is to be said if they be Ori­
ental or Occidental in respect of the Son and the World.
OF HO NO UR AND DIGNITY*
W e consider those things which concern dignities, and this
blessed part, from the disposition o f the Lights, and the'fa­
miliarity of the Stars by which they are gaurded. There­
fore if both the Lights be found in masculine Signs, and
eithcr^Sbth or one of them angular, that is, the © by day,

5 4 8 T H E C E L E S T I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E R .
and tbe € by night chiefly the conditionary j and especially
if they have the- Satellitium of the five Planets, the © being
gaurded by Oriental Stars, and the { by Occidental, they
that are born will he kings: f and if the guarding Stars be
angular or configurated to the superior Cardinal House of
heaven, they wiU be great and powerful, as Lords o f the
■ World, whose happiness and honour will indeed be greater:
if the Satellites make configurations Dexter$ but i f other*
wise thus it happens, that the Q plpne is in a masculine Sign
and the { in feminine, and of the two one oply being in an
Angle* they that arc born sh^dl Roly be princes, having pow­
er of life and death. I f the Luminaries being so in these,
god neither of the Sattcllities bo angular, nor give testimony
tq tbe Angles, they shall be great, but have particular hon­
o r s , as guardians, geperalfc or princely dignity j but not
having principality: and if the Lights not being in Angles,
it happens that most of the guarding Stars be angular, or con­
figurated to the Angles, they will not give the more illustri"
ous dignities j nevertheless they will moderately excel in civil
affairs. If neither of the Satellites are configurated to the
Angles, they will be obscure, and not promoted to h on o u r:
and if not one of the Lights be found either in a masculine
Sign, nor angular, nor gaurded by the Benefics, they are bom
to be extremely abject, and of a very unhappy mind*
Therefore, tfie general description of highness and lowness

o f dignities hath such a speculation ; but an infinite number
o f things in a mediocrity ate to be considered from the mu­
tation and variety which happens particularly about the Lights
themselves, and the Satellitium, and the dominion of the Sa­
tellites.* For the Benefics assuming the dominion, or they
which are of the same condition, they will possess dignities
with greater authority, and will be more firm : but if the
Malefics assume the dominion, or they of the contrary con­
dition, they will be of a lower order, and more uncertain *
And we observe the kind of dignities from the properties
o f the Satellities: for if f? hath dominion he will give rich
and wealthy government. The rule from % and $ will be
pleasant, full of gifts and honour. That from will be a-
bout expeditions, victories, and terrible to subjects. That
from $ by understanding, prudence, learning, diligence, and
care of affairs.
* First, Io the preceding part of this treatise I have told you, that
the Satellities of the Sun ore Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercu­
ry ; and those and no other are the Satellites so often mentioned here; and
the SateHitiuu and guards, are the concourse or number of them at any
time respecting the Luminaries.
Secondly, That though the Author here is very particular and positive
concerning respective dignities, yet we are not to understand that hereby
he intends that nH that are so boro shall arrive to sudh dignities, nor that
every one that doth shall be equal therein: for many who have such
princely positions, have also others that cuts the thread of life be&re they
can arrive to them < and of such as do arrive thereto, their respective sig-
ni/icators are "ot of equal fortitude to support it ; and if they were, the
title to such dominion is not the same in all Princes; for the dominions

The Lord o f the Profession is taken (wo ways, from the
O , and the Sign which hath dominion of the Mid-heaven.
Therefore we ought to observe the Star that maketh Oriental
appearaee next to the © : and that which agrees with the
Medium-cceli, either therein, or in familiarity thereto ; chief-
fy when it respects the application of the C : and if one and
the same Star , hath power in both, respects, w e take that
alone, for what is enquired after; and if it is not found in
both respects, but only in one of the two, that alone shall
betaken: but i f one next appear befbr the ©> and^ another
be in the Mid heaven, and hath familiarity with the ( , both
•hail be taken5 but he shall be prefered who is the most strong
unto the dominion.
I f none be found making application, nor in the Mid-hea*
ven, he that hath dominion of the Medium*cceli, w e take
the proper significator of the office, exercise, or study to which
to which some have ti.le, is far short of what others have: and though
some by reason of the extraordinary power of-their proper significatovs
of honour and dominion, do often invade the rights of others; yet as such
more powerful significators are not so common as others ^ neither are
such invasions as general as the particular titles o f Princes to respective
dominions. The like is to be understood of riches,,pleasures, wedlock,
children, friends, and enemies, travelling, or the lik e; for though these
n a y In the nativity be testimonies very large for such matters, yet where
there are other testimonies of short life, it follows that where death
thereupon accordingly ensues, that all other externals naturally cease an4
are prevented.

the N ative will be agreeable to apply himself; at least when
w e know the business is commodious to the situation in life ^
because some are bom for idleness from the constitution of
their Stars: and the things which ooncern the Lord of the ac­
tion is thus investigated.
A nd the kind of profession will be made known by the pro**
perties of the three Stars* that is* when they have dominion
o f the profession* viz. $ , and and the Signs in which
they are: for g makes scribes* managers of business* cal*
cnlators* masters* dealers* exchangers* diviners* astrologers
and those who live by learning and interpretation* and the
stipends and gifts of others : and if T? give testimony to him
they will be stewards to others* or interpreters of dreams* ot
conversant in churches for the sake of divination and enthusi*
a m : if % give testimony* they w ill be limners* orators* so-
phisters* conversant with great personages.
I f 9 have dominion of the profession* she will make those
conversent with the scent of flowers* unguents* and wines*
colours* tinctures* spices j as unguent makers* planters 6 f gar*
lands* vintners* apothecaries* weavers* sellers o f spices* lim*
ners* dyers* sellers of garments: and if gives testimony
to her* she will make men dealers in tilings which relate to
pleasure and adorning* sorcerers* poisoners, deceivers* and
those that deal in such lik e: but if % give testimony to her*
they will be champions* bearers of armory* promoted to bon*
our by favour of the women.
But $ ruling the profession* configurated with <•)* he wiU

makes shipwrights, carpenters, husbandmen, stone-cutters,
cutters of wood, under workmen. I f I? gives testimony to
him, he makes seamen, emptiers of vaults, feeders of beasts,
cooks, butchers. If % give testimony, he will make soldiers,
servants, tax-gatherers, inn-keepers, custom*gatherers, sacri­
fices. -
Again, two being found rulers of the profession together,
if they be 9 and 9 , they make musicians, causers o f melody,
and they that are busied about instruments, songs, and poe­
try, and chiefly when they change places $ for then they make
stage-players, actors, buyers of men, instrumentmakers,
dancers, players on stringed instruments, caperers, alias tum­
blers, workers in wax, paiflters: and if I? gives testimony to
them, he will make with those mentioned, those that deal in
women’s ornaments^ and if % give testimony, they will be
.lawyers, employed in the common wealth, teachers o f child­
ren, rulers of the commons. . /
I f <J and § together be Lords o f the magistery, they will
be makers of statues, of armour, engravers of holy things,
formers of animals, wrestlers, (Cardan says physicians,) sur­
geons, accusers, adulterers, evil-doers, forgers o f writings:
and if I? give testimony to them, they will,be homicides,
stealers of clothes, rapatious, thieves, stealers of cattle, con­
jurors.
I f $ and 9 together take the Lordship, they will be dy­
ers, ointment makers, workers in tin and lead, gold and sil­
ver, dancersun armour, apothecaries, husbandmen, physici­

ans caring by medicines : and if Tj give testimony, they\vill
take care of sacred animals, be sextous, lamenters and pipers
at funerals, enthusiasts, conversant in mysteries, lamenta-
tions, and blood: and if f? give testimony, he will make
men sacrificefs, augurs, bearers of holy things, rulers of wo­
men, interpreters, and they who live by such things.
Moreover the quality of the Signs in which the Lords of
the profession be, confer the variety of the profession : for
they of the human-shape conduce to all those sciences and ex­
ercises which are for the use of man. But four-footed Signs
conduce to metalic arts, negotiations, buildings, smiths and
carpenters art. Tropical and equinoctial Signs, to interpreta­
tions, commutations, measuring, husbandry, and priesthood.’
Earthy and watery Signs, to arts conversant about water, and
by water, herbs, and ship-makers, and aIso burying, pickling
and salting.
Again, the { properly possessing the place of profession,
and having a course with $ from the d-with ©, in g and
VP, and 25 will make diviners, sacrifices, diviners by bason ;
in $ and H she makes mourners, and those moved by de­
vils ; in flf and n\ magicians, astrologers, speakers of ora­
cles, having foreknowledge; In si, T and ft, she make*
enthusiasts, -interpreters of dreams and conjurors.
Therefore the kinds of profession is distinguished by these;
but the greatness thereof is manifested from the strength of
the ruling Stars : for being oriental or angular, they make
the profession powerful$ but occidental or declining from
gles, makes them subordinate.

I f the Benches are* superior,*they will be great, gainful,

Lords of the profession, it will be mean, inglorious, unpro­
fitable and uncertain.
Saturn therefore bringeth opposition by cold, and mixture
o f colours: (slowness and lukewarmness, says Cardan ;) but
^ through boldness and divulgation ; and both are opposite
-to the perfection o f the profession : but the general time of
increase or diminution of arts, is judged from the disposition
-o f the Stars, which cause the effect, which they have in the
^respect o f the Oriental and Occidental Angles *

Cardan in his comment on this part savs, the Planet making Oriental
appearance, most not in this case be above 30 degrees from the San, and
that if 2 or S Planets be so taken, that which is nearest the Sun moat be
elected before others, provided he can be well seen.

not marry at all. Moreover, if she be in a Sign of one form
and apply to only one of the Star*, she makes men marry but
once. I f in a Sign Bicorppreal, or of many forms, or apply
to m any Stars (in the same Sign, says Cardan) she causeth
m any marriages; and if the Stars which receive the applica­

W hen therefore both the Gtnitures o f the Man and Wife,
have the Lights so configurate with agreement, that is be­
ing ^ or A to each other, their living together for the most
part continues, and chitfiy when the agreement is with
cJhange* : and the duration will be more firm, when the
husband’s tf agrees with the © of his w ife: but if the posi­
tion of the Lights be in Signs inconjunct or opposite, or in a
square, the living together will be disolved on light occasions,
and they will be finally estranged from each other.
I f the Benefics behold the configuration of the Lights which
they make with agreement, the duration o f their marriage

externals: but if 9 be under the © beams, they will copu­
late with more eminent and genteel persons . and the Stars
be in .Feminine places, or configurated after a feminine man­
ner, they will be only prone to be passive; if they be dispos­
ed after a masculine manner, to be active also. 1? haring
familiarity to these configurations, (and he in feminine Signs,
adds Cardan.) contributed! to the greater filthiness: if Ori­
ental and Masculine, obnoxious to infancy and reprehension
by reason of detestable lu st: if helped by the Star o f %$to
the greater modesty ; $ , to the actions bring more notori-,
ous, dangerous and open.
Cardan here adds; And so if the Signs -be Feminine, to women. If
both be matutine, they will born after boys.
OF C H IL D R E N .
It follows after these that we pass to the treatise'concern­
ing Children. Therefore this observation is to be taken from
the Stars that are in or configurated to the Mid-heaven, or
the succedant, which they call the Good Demon. I f there
s be not any Stars in that place» or configurated, yon ought to
observe the opposites.
The < and % and £ are assumed for givers o f Children;
yGoc -le
T H E C E L E S T I A L I N T E L L I G E N C E R . 3 6 1
the O , $ and P
? are assumed for sterility or paucity of.Chil­
dren-: but 9 being common to both, contributes according
to that to which he is configurated : giving when he is Orien­
tal in the east, but taking away .when he is Occidental in the
west.
Therefore the Stars that are givers of Children, being so
disposed, and by themselves, give one child} but in double­
bodied Signs, or in feminine, they cause the generating of
twin*.
So also being in fruitful Signs, as 25; III, X> they give
two or more. I f they be of a masculine nature, because of
the configuration to the 0 , and because of being in mascu­
line Signs, they will give males j but if of a feminine nature,
females. If tbey be overcome by the Malefics, or be found
in barren places or Signs, such as Si and r%, thdy will give
children, but not for good or vital. I f the 0 and the Male­
fics possess the said places, that is the Mid-heaven and the
succedant of the Good Demon, if they be in masculine or
steril Signs, and have not the Benefics superior, they shew ut­
ter want of children : but if they be in feminine or fruitful
Signs, or aided by testimony of the Benefics, they give chil­
dren indeed, but such as are hurt and short-lived.
Both conditions f being configurated and havingrespect to
prolific Signs, there will happen a rejection of children ac­
cording to the excess which the Stars giving testimony have
t That is, if the Malefics have Dominion, and the Benefics give Tes­
timony.
By the Good Deipoo here mentioned, the Author intends the eleventh

in each condition, cither of ail the children, or of a few at
most, as they are found more powerful by being more Orien­
tal, or more angular, or more elevated, or more succedant.
Therefore, if the Lords of the mentioned Signs being gi­
vers of children, be Oriental, or in proper places, the given
childfed will be famous and glorious, J f Occidental, or not
in proper places, they wtH be obscure and mean.
Moreover, if theyagree with the and Horoscope, they
will make them beloved by their parents, pleasant, and heiiy
of their goods. But if they be found, unconjoined/asd dis­
agreeing, they will be rebellious, odious and hurtful to tbeir
parents, and will miss the inheritance of their substance.
Moreover, if the Stars which give children are agreeably
Configurated among themselves*, they will make them lovers
of their brethren, and respectful to each other.
And such Js the general consideration of children, but ia
those particulars which fallow, .wrought to assume the Horo­
scope, at each Star of those which give the children*, and ob*
serve and judge the other dispositions as in a nativity.

observe the stronger of the made configurations.
For the most part if the Lights fall to the inclining of the
Oriental Quadrants, the travelling will happen to be towards
the east and south parts, but if in the Occidental Quadrants,
the peregrination will be towards the north or west. '

But h an^ 3 possessing the Lights, especially if they are
opposed mutually to them, they n
vill cause great dangers and
unprofitable travelling. But being in moist Signs, they will
produce dangers by ship wrecks, or by desart and unaccessi-
ble places. In fixed, by precipices and contrary winds. In
tropical and equinoctial, by want of necessaries, and a sick-
jy constitution of the air. In human shaped, by robbers,
ambushes, and thefts. In earthly, by the increase of wild
beasts, or earthquakes. But if § concur, the danger will oc­
cur through accusations, and creeping things and ^casters of

The reason of these peculiar judgements, whether they will
be gainful or hurtful, is taken from the difference o f that
Planet which gives the cause; and the cause of the compre­
hended places, works and posessions, power, and dignities is
to be considered according to the first and principal consti-

It remains that we speak of the quality of death And w e
know this from what has been said in the discourse about the
space of life, how death will happen, the ruling place being
Oriental or Occidental. r
For if death happens by the Orientality, or occurse of the
beams, the place of the occurse ought to be observed, and ac­
cording to that judge of the quality of death. I f it be occi­
dental; consider the Occidental place, for such as they are
which rule the mentioned places j or if none rule then such*
as before others are carried to these places, such ought we to
esteem the deaths, the configurating Stars concurring, and
also the quality of the mentioned killing places, and the na­
ture o f the Signs and the Terms.

those which proceed from abundance of moisture, or through

choly, falling sickness, falls, coughs, spitting affections, or
those which happen simply through much dryness or want
thereof: but thus they die naturally, when the rulers of
death are in their proper and natural quality, and none of
.tlje Malefics concur.

J i f f i e s are Lords of the Anaretic places, or, are joined,
square, oppose, or otherwise evilly affect both the Lights, or
ibe © alone, or the g ,' or both; for then the mischievous­
ness of death proceeds from the congress of the M alefics;
but the greatness of the death, from the testimony o f the
Lights.
Its Quality is known from the rest of the aspecting Stars,
and the Signs containing the Malefics.

testimony to <J, death will happen through the anger o f Prin­

ly agree together, and so oppose any of the said places, they
make the cruelty of the death the more; but the quality of
death and the dominion, will offer near that which is in the
Anaretic.
Death happens m strange places when the Stars which pos­
sess the Anaretic places fall from Angles, and especially when
the ( either is found with, or in square, or oppose the said
places.
It is here evident, first, that Ptolemy, whom the generali­
ty of Astrologers by one consent, have acknowledged to be
the Prince and principal of their profession, had not the least
regard t<
'>the 8th House, or its Lord, for the cause and qua­
lity of death ; as taught in vulgar astrology ; but, in all vi­
tal nativites to directions, either direct by \vbich the An are-
tic point is carried to the place of the Givers of life, err con­
verse by the Hv leg’s being carried to the west Angle, winch
alone of all converse directions hath power to cut off' life.
Secondly, in such natiutirs as are vital, one direction, how
malevolent soever, rarely kills; but in all or most Nativities
whatsoever, there is required a bain ot malevolent directions

to concur to death j for it hath been most admirably proved
by the laborious Partridge in his Opus Reformatum add De-
fectio Qenituranim, even but one single direction, though it
be a a or £ of the Benevolent*, intervening among such
trains o f malevolent directions, (that is directions of the rag*
levolents) concur so together with the aid or interveniogs of
the Benevolents, they fail not to destroy life.
Thirdly, in such trains of directions, the author here dfe«
tinguisheth between the killing Planet and the causer of the
Quality of death 5 for one Planet doth not give both. Thu
foremost o f the malevolent train is the killing Place, and
shews the time of death; but the following directions, though
Benevolent, shew the quality. If the train fall all together,
and none follow, for the quality observe those which precede,
though at a distance and benevolent also; for though the Be­
nevolent contribute to the preservation of life as aforesaid,
yet they frequently specify the disease which is the cause o f
death. And with these our author tells us concur the confi­
gurating Stars, the quality of the Stars and Signs, and the
terms in which their Lords happen. ,
Fourthly, In violent deaths the Genethliacal positions of
the Lights are to be observed, and how the Malefics affect
them, and are glso concerned by directions in the quality of
death.

OF SECONDARY DIRECTIO NS.
By Secondary Directions*, we are to understand those son-
figuration and familiarities of the Planets which prise daily
from, the time of birth, and are applied to the prediction of
events that are to come to paqs in the same succession of
years from the birth, ascorrespond with those days. For ex­
ample* all aspects of the Stars, both to the Luminaries and
cardinal Houses, that happen on the first day after birth,
are applied to the first year 5 those of the second.day after
birth, to the second year > those of the third day, to the

hird year, and so on in progressive rotation, as far as this
ipeculation can extend.
In the management of these direction we are principally to
observe what configurations <
T has to the other Planets ; for
if she be joined with benefic Stars, or Eradicated by their
good aspects, or even by the good aspects of the Infortunes,
it denotes a happy, healthful, and prosperous' year to the
Native, in nature and quality peculiar to the principal signi-
ficator in each configuration, and to the Houses and Signs
in which they fall in the Radical figure. But on the contra­
ry, if ( be joined to malevolent Stars, or irradiated by them,
or in parallel declination of the Infortunes, it forebodes to
those years pointed out by the days in which these evil con­
figurations happen, great afflictions either in mind, body, or
estate $ and if a primary direction should correspond with
them, of the same malignant nature, a complication of tem­
poral misfortunes will most probably ensue.
In the consideration of these directions, we are particular­
ly to attend to the critical days and climacterical years; for at
those timet the good or evil configurations of the Planets are
m ost powerful in their operation, If upon either of those
occasions the { be found in n or 5* to the place in which
she wS9 posited at the time o f birth, and%n evil primary di­
rection of the signification of life correspond therewith,
D eath it then at tl*e -door, or at that time very much fo be
feared even in the strongest constitutions, or however healthy
they may appear to be when.they begin to take effect.

And so likewise if 0 or tin the secondary di
afflicted by the malignant rays pf inauspicious eonfigatiom,
with an evrl primary direction, with which both the Re­
volution and Transit agree, it is considered an irrevocable in­
dication of death to the Native.
These secondary directions have always been iqreputation
among the Arabs and Egyptians, who in common practice,
prefer this method of predicting from the genethltacai Fi­
gure, to the more complicated and laborious mode of calcu­
lation by the primary directions. The former practice has
doubtless the advantage in point of expedition ; for fyy the
use of it in those countries, they will* upon the bate inspec­
tion of a Nativity, give an account of the general and parti­
cular incidents, during the whole course of the Native’s life.
It is a doctrine much on a level with that of Horary- Ques­
tions, and may be used to give a generaj idea of the Native's
figure of birth, and of bis. probable bent of fortune, where
time or circumstances will not admit of particular calcu­
lations. .

pear not': or ihkt it is not air in which they breath, because
aotbitig' appears to them but an insensible vacuity > Surely
all that know they possess a soul must of necessity behove
the rule and government of Angels, which they see not j
nbd from no other groups, they must, l think, from that
apparent analogy, which they cannot but perceive between
the greater and the lessor world$ for as the little world man,
consists of an outward visible body, and an inward spiritual
soul, which gives life and motion, to the organic*! frame,
so possessing all ports to be wholly in all, and in each dia-
tinct part wholly 5 so must it be also in the great universe
the sensible and material part whereof hath being and motion
from those spiritual powers, which dwell in, and wholly fill
and actuate it: therefore the Astrologianregards Nature with
the eyes of St. Paul, 2 Cor. iv. 18 verse, he looks not at the
things which are seen, but at the things which are nest seen :
fo r things which are not seen are eternal.
Having now laid down the rudiments of this pleasing and
instructive science in as plain and intelligent a manner as pos«
sible,v I shall immediately proceed to teach the application
thereof, in briefly calculating the following Nativities. It
is my wish to perform this task in such a manner, as to ena­
ble the young learner to accompany me in the business, and
to follow me in bringing up some principal directions to their
*proper Aspects, as they shall respectively occur in the Gs-
nethliacal figures. If I can do this, I have no doubt of soon

convincing the roost obstinate unbeliever of -the Science, that
It has both utility and truth on its side 3.and; tbpt the beings
of reason, who bear the image of their beneficent ^Creator,
are not wholly left without the help of forefight gnd fore­
knowledge, if they will but adopt the. necessary means of
acquiring it. .
The following Nativities fall under my own observation
and knowledge, and I have chose, them in preference to any
that have been before published or to those of persons not
now living, because I would avoid putting, it in the powerjof
any person .to say, that our calculations are in the;least foun­
ded. upon enquiries into peoples way of life, o f their good
. or ill fortune, of their sickness or health, of the particular
incidents of their past life, or of the external causes of their
. death j for if the rules which I have so fully laid d$wn, will
*not enable us to accomplish all this, Crop* the situation of the
•Planets, or .face, of the Heavens in the figure of birth, our
science is indeed a mere delusion, and its followers nothing
better than jugglers and imposters*
But to make this enquiry easy to my readers, and to save
them as much as possible the trouble of tedious calculations,
I have introduced a variety of Tables, which are so contriv­
ed as .to fesolve every question that is of a mundane nature.
I shall reduce them to practice, in calculating the following
Nativities, in. such a manner as to make them easy and fami­
liar: hoping by this means to remove, if possible, that sud­
den impression of difficulty and emb^traspaent, which is felt
by most readers on the first view of mathematical Tables. I

am persuaded no difficulty whatever will attend the acquisi-
. lion of a competent knowledge of these, if a proper atten­
tion be paid to them: without which little progress can be
expected. The most accomplished Artist of us all could no*
ver yet bestow the gift of inspiration, which is only given to
a few, since we read, that<(to one is given the word of wis-
dorq, to another the word of knowledge, to another faith, to
another the gift of hbaiing, to another the working of mira­
cles, to another divers Irinds of tongues, .to anoiher inter­
pretation of tongues. But all these worketb that one and.
the self same spirit dividing unto every man severally as he
will,*/ and therefore without suitable endeavours, let noqe

Jupiter within orbs of a 6 w ith;? although going off and
in the 6th, disposes his mind to sentiments. of liberality and
justice, gives him ingenuity and perseverance, strengthens
his intellect (though $ is in his detriment) by a good memo*

which bestow an admirable conception in literary pursuits,
with a mind formed fpr invention and study.
4 Jupiter configurated with 9 disposes his mind to the pur­
suit of learning and wisdom, and gives those natural endow?*
lamentsof a refined intellect, and gives the Native agenius/or
poetry, for this ^ produces the most accoqapliahed politician^,

Lilly saifh if a'benevolent Planet aspect the 4 with an evil

For this is a rule that will never be found to fail, if our arith­
metic be true, that at the very time the principal sigoificator
in a nativity, that is, the Giver o f Life, shall arrive at the ana­
lytical point of the Aspect of the Killing Plaoet, the Native
shall surely depart this life, provided no bcnefic rays at the

pede the killing force, which may always be known from

by the fo egoing rules, bring up the directions with sufficient
accuracy to ascertain the precise length of time, in years,
months and days, in which the significator of life will be in
moving to the Anaretical or Killing point, and just so long
will be the life of that Native. Where then is the mystery or
impossibility of ascertaining the period of human life, and with
extraordinary prccission > But this accuracy wholly depends
upon the true time of birth being obtained $ for a failure here,
in the radical point will destroy the whole calculation, and
nothing predicted therefrom can possibly happen but by the

"This Nativity was rectified by an acci4ent which may be
seen by the foregoing rectification, which does oot much differ
from the supposed tigie of birth.
*Here the © was not directed for the fatal accident, for he
governs the ahimai spirits of the brafn, and C the moisture of
the body, but the Ascendant (by which this Nativity can on­
ly be rectified) is by all Authors considered to denote the ao
dldents of the body, and consequently all malevolent aspects
made thereto must necessarily affect it.
In the Native’s celestial constitution we find many positions
and configurations of a very violent nature.' Lddy o f the*
Ascendant, under whose influence the Native governed, is:
configurated with T? and (J, and therefore participates of their
quality and nature. The ^ is posited in ^ 6ut o f all his
essential dignities. % having dignities in the place o f the © ,
is Lord o f the 6th the House of sickness and disease, and po- »
slffed therein, afflicted by the Malcvolents. The C dispositor
of the.© is also posited in an unfortunate cadent House, out
of all her essential dignities, and only in a Sign of her own
triplicity, conjoined with %9but is separating from h is^rf, *
and applying with great rapidity to the destructive aspects o f \
I? and $ Lords of the 4th and 8th H qu^ s j and both the in- :

e
greatest injury, and was at length entirely consumed with
burning heat.
Thus it is evident from her figure of birth, that the Na*
tiye’s death should arise by means of fire. And in herlast
xevolutional figure, the © Lord o f the Ascendant in theradi­
cal figure, was posited in the 8th House, in <J with $ kord

which nothing but the rational means made use o f by Heft*

namely, unfeigned prayer, and a determined spirit t»abandoo

I am induced to give the foregoing Horpscope a place in

Stars, upon a malefactor, whose crimes exposed him to the
forfeiture of his liberty and life, by the iron hand of thekw,
This unfortunate man resided in Bath, but the particular
occurrences that prompted him to con^cpit the barbarous act of
murder is so well known, that I presuipe # w ill not be re­
quired of me to enter into a detail thereof.

There are many evil conjurations in this Geniturc, noil
only tending to shew a short life, 4Mifc* violent and untimely
death. § joint ruler of the Asqendant is retrograde dn4 com­
bust o f the Q , in the 13th House, which is an infallible argU*
meat of a short life and wretched end; and this is rfurther

son ment and many sorrows: and this happened on the 23 rd
o f December, 1808, when the j transited the Cusp of the
12tfa, and <J Lord o f the 12tb.
Here let is be remembered.Q is partly the Native’s signifi-
cator, and his n with \> foreshews the Native to be unfor­
tunate in all his actions, of a perverse, self-willed, evil, raa*
licieus, envious, treacherous dispositou, and it may be a mur­
derer, for h stirs up mercurial men to all manner of wicked­
ness j he will be deceitful above measure, of a dejected mind,
revengeful, and bringing nothing to perfection.
The n of the © and Tj is much to be regarded, it is al­
ways the aspect of contempt and infamy j it shews danger of*
a violent death, and it may be by the hand of justice, especi­
ally if T? is Lord of the 10th j the Native aims at high and
great things, but always misses his expectations, for his very
attempts are only his. ruin both of goods and estate, and may
sometimes cost his life. Saturn therefore, not only in n

causeth death by suffocation,^ tumults of the people, or by

his unfortunate position in the 12th, under such destructive
configurations, foreshews the worst of evils, and the murder
he committed in consequence, thereof.

tion will find the content of its Arch, 2 3 ° 18 ', which turned

y e a r v l 1 months and 3 days, which exactly answered to the
Jfetive’s age.
Let the young learner always remember, that when there
are arguments of a violent death,, under similar positions,
this direction will always put an inglorious period to the N a ­

But though the Native was born under such destructive
aspects, yet during his confinement, It appears he conducted
himself with the most becoming propriety and christian-like
behaviour, strictly adhering to the pious admonitions of those
who seriously interested themselves in preparing him to meet
his awful fate.
W hen sentence of death was passed, he received it wifh
great firmness of mind and Christian fortitude $ he returned
to the place of confinement, fell on his knees and prayed For
those who gave evidence against him, hoping that the L oid
would shew his mercy upon them, and awaken their hope in
the grace of G od ; he had no desire to live but as an instru­
ment in the hand of providence, to bring his wife and mo­
ther to the knowledge of the love of Christ 5 to guilty men,
in seeking and saving those that were dead in trespasses and
sins^ plucking them out o f the fire as brands for the burning*
— He spent the evening in prayer and praise to G od, Who
bad called him out o f darkness into his marvelous light 5 he
was quite composed, and slept easy that night $ during the
short period he had to remain in this life, he continued in un­
abated devotion to Him who was able to save his soul from

On the morning of his execution he said he was happy,
his mind was serene and composed, happy in the expectation
of meeting his G od in peace and love$ G ob being well pleas­
ed in his beloved Son, and will call sin no more to remem-
brranee.—He was taken from the place of confinement to the
fatal spot, a space of about three miles, with a smile upon
his countenance, praying and praising the G od of his salva­
tion for his abundant mercy, and that he might be supported
in the hour of death with the light of his countenance,* this
there is every reason to believe was granted him, and that he
died in full assurance of a better resurection.—He requested
the executioner not to pull his legs, or do any thing to hasten
his death, but that he might feel all the punishment the law
had sentenced him to bear he acknowledged the justness
of his sentence, that “ whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man
shall his blood be shed.,v
The road was filled at an early hour with spectators, to
witness the awful and melancholy sight of a young man in
the prime of life, going to suffer the law for murder, com­
mitted on the body of John Dyer, in the moments of violent
passion and intemperance.

A s a treat and cariosity to my readers, I bare here intro*
duced the Nativity of Nafolean Bokapabtb, pourtraying
the chief events of his life, and the time and manner of hia
death. From the time given by himself to an eminent A s­
tronomer in Corsica, via. August the 15th. 1769, at a quar­
ter before 10, A .M . calculations have been made, but as there
is a small difference in the manner of erecting the Horoscope*
Ac. I present mine, in chy opinion, more congenial with the
writings o f Ptolomy than any o f them. By only turning
the equal time into the Solar, and working the direction^
J find that at 15 years and 2 months, the Ascendant was di«*
rected to the A of 9 in Mundo* and © to the £ o f ? iu

Washerwoman's daughter; and a few months afterwards

he has reigned too long $ and his death will be suddenand
violent, either by suffocation or drowning. The method
here taken admits of two kinds of Aspects, viz one in the
Ecliptic without latitude, and the other in mundo, viz with
th e Planets declination, and is a proportional part of the Di­
urnal and Nocturnal Arches; and the Meridian and Horizon,
as well as the Planets may be directed to both; the modern
Aspects, viz. the semiquadra e, sesquiqurdrate, &c are here
rejected, because not' mentioned by Ptolomy, the Imperana
