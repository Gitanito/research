PREFACE
IN
THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF MY EXPERIENCES DURING
twenty-nine years as a medium before the public I have tried
to record faithfully what seemed to me would be of interest
and of help to my friends, and if I have succeeded, I shall con
sider my labors well repaid.
Of the many people who read this book, some will know
me personally and will have been present in seances during
which one or more of the related incidents took place. The ma
jority, however, will have to accept my statements as facts.
Many people professing a belief in communication, and taking
advantage of it in times of trouble, are not willing to uphold
their belief in public. Others do not care to have what they are
pleased to consider their personal affairs written down in con
nection with their names. It is for these two reasons that I have
refrained from using identifying names throughout the text.
Nevertheless, many of the cases related will be vouched for
by the people concerned, if any reader wishes to verify them.
I do not ask blind acceptance of my facts by those who are
not acquainted with me. Leaders in other religions do ask this
acceptance on faith alone and offer no proof of many of their
statements. I ask that my accounts be believed for two reasons:
First, consider the reasonableness and applicability to daily
life of the teachings and advice contained herein. All these have
come through the seance room directly from our Spirit friends.
If this advice is reasonable, place faith in my statements of
how it came to be given.
v
vi Preface
>>>>>>>>->-»»>>>».>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Second, the proof that has come to thousands through my
seances and messages can be brought to many more by the
same means. What has been done before can be done again.
In the following pages I have tried to select those experi
ences which seemed to be the most interesting and which taught
some definite lesson. There are hosts of other cases which I
might relate, but there would be no particular reason for doing
so. Human nature in all its variability follows fairly definite
lines, and what happens to one person often happens to an
other with only minor changes in details.
I have made a definite attempt not to emphasize the dis
agreeable episodes occurring in my work. I have recounted
some of them through the necessity of bringing out certain
facts, but I have not given them the prominence which the
frequency of their occurrence warrants.
It would surprise the average reader to know how great is
the number of people attending a seance for the first time who
come under false names and often in actual disguise as far as
features and clothing are concerned. They would not think of
going in such a way to other churches. Why they come to a
seance in this manner I have been unable to determine in all
the years of my work. They cannot fool the Spirit World;
they only fool themselves out of beautiful messages by the
barrier of deceit they erect.
Frequently I scarcely have been able to restrain my laugh
ter at some people—those who have come with the idea that
a medium is a mind-reader. The very obvious labor they are
performing in order to keep their minds on some simple
thought extraneous to themselves, which, they have been told,
is the proper method to prevent the medium's reading personal
facts from their minds, is ludicrous in the extreme. I have ex
Preface vii
<.««.««.«« < < <. < < < < <. < <
< <. < < < < <
plained later in the book that thoughts have power and, it
may be, can be read by highly developed spirits on the Other
Side, but I have yet to learn of a single instance where a human
thought has harmed anyone except its parent or has been able
to convey a message or any facts to a medium. Almost invari
ably the Spirit World gives as a test to a stranger some fact
which he has not thought of for years and removes at one
stroke the idea that mind-reading by the medium has any place
in the phenomena.
I believe that the unreasonable barriers thrown up by the
medical profession to keep those ailing from receiving any
help from spiritual sources, and the penalties for any ap
proaches to these barriers, are too well known to warrant much
discussion. I have confined myself to an exposition of the tenu
ous basis upon which such prohibitions rest, attempting to
show that the medical profession could learn much for human
ity's sake from the Spirit doctors.
I have given no extended detailed account of my several
arrests and trials for "practicing Spiritualism," instructive
though they might be in showing to what lengths human be
ings will go in persecuting those whom they do not under
stand. Such outstanding martyrs of history as Jesus Christ,
Joan of Arc, the so-called "witches" of Salem, and many
others are clear examples of beautiful souls sacrificed upon the
altar of ignorance.
Throughout the book will be found reference to "Natural
Law." This, I have been taught to understand, is a general
term which embraces all phases of the operation of God's
Plan throughout the universe. Examples of different phases
would be the law of gravitation, with which all of us are fa
miliar; the law of attraction, which says that like attracts like
viii Preface
>>>>»>»>>>.>->.»>»>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
everywhere; the law of compensation, which states that we are
repaid in kind for everything we do, whether for good or for
harm ; and the law of communication, which teaches that com
munication between souls, no matter where they are located,
is possible and which defines the conditions necessary to be ful
filled before this communication can take place. There are many
other aspects of this law known to us, and many other aspects
unknown to us. The closer we live in harmony with what we
do know of Natural Law, the more successful we shall be in
the conduct of our earthly experience and the happier. For
these reasons I have attempted to explain carefully what our
loved ones have told us about certain aspects of Natural Law.
Let me say finally: read with an open mind and seek to
understand, for I am sure that many of you will find your
selves repaid by a different and very satisfying conception of
the future life.

INTRODUCTION
O MANY PEOPLE, UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS A FACT THAT
1L Spiritualism means an impious religion instigated and fos
tered by the devil to confound man.
To many others it means haunted houses and graveyards,
table-tippings, rappings, and other similar phenomena.
To many more it means fortune-telling, crystal-gazing, ad
vice on love and like activities.
To relatively few does it mean a beautiful religion teaching
love and hope through a knowledge of God's Law brought
directly to us by His messengers, those who have passed over
to the other side of the thin veil separating mortal from Spirit
and who have worked and developed there to
fit
themselves
for this loving duty.
During my twenty-nine years as
a
medium before the public
I
have been the instrument through which this last concep
tion has been given to many people. The Stead Center has
sought to disseminate this idea as widely as possible
by
means
of
seances, lectures, and publications in order to lift Spiritual
ism out
of
the abyss
of
ignorance, misconception, and fraud in
which
it
lies and to elevate
it
to its proper rank as one
of
the
most beautiful and pure
of
the world's religions. Rightly un
derstood,
it
offers more real consolation, hope, and love than
any other faith.
It does not deny to anyone the right to seek God in whatever
xi
xii Introduction
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»»•>■
way he wishes. Any particular system of beliej avowed by
the individual is proper if it serves his purpose. All creeds seek
to assist man in his effort to understand God's Plan and to live
his life in accordance with
it,
whether the creed be
a
simple
one
of
a
savage or
a
complex one
of
an Eastern race. Each
man seeks God in
a
different manner, according to his own
personal understanding. Naturally some men have
a
better
comprehension than others; some creeds are better than oth
ers in that they are nearer the truth. All
of
us are God's chil
dren, and every man will develop in his understanding
of
his
Father
if
he obeys his conscience and lives his earth life to the
best
of
his ability. No particular person, no particular sect, has
been specially favored
by
God or selected
by
Him to be the
only means through which an understanding
of
Him may be
reached.
Spiritualism makes no claim
of
possessing the sole gateway
to heaven or any other place. It seeks only to make the way
of
spiritual development easier
by
bringing
a
clearer, truer pic
ture
of
God's Plan to man through the agency
of
His messen
gers, those who have preceded us and advanced far in their
knowledge
of
Him. By teaching and proving that we can com
municate directly with these souls,
it
offers to us an opportu
nity to receive our information straight and pure, not muddled
and befuddled
by
intervening earthly hands and brains.
All religions have been founded upon teachings received
from the Spirit World
by
the agency
of
a
medium and con
sequently agree in many fundamentals. It
is
the man-made
ornaments and knick-knacks subsequently hung on them that
have obscured and altered their pure root. Spiritualism should
Introduction xiii
«<.
be considered as a tree whose branches are the various religions
of the world. They all have grown from the same root; some
are close to the trunk, some far away, but the root and trunk
remain the same and feed the rest because they only receive
their food direct from the source, those who have the wonder
ful spiritual development which permits them to be God's
messengers.
By teaching that life is continuous and progress is eternal,
that life on earth is only an incident in the mighty, beautiful
plan of God, Spiritualism gives a meaning to our existence
which is lacking if we believe that "death" ends everything,
or if we believe that it terminates our progress—that we enter
a place called heaven or hell fust as we are when leaving the
earthly existence and remain in that stage of development for
ever afterwards.
Great harm comes from the belief that death is the end of
the individual. It makes for despondency ; for a reckless in
dulgence in earthly pleasures, turning them into vices; for a
total disregard of human life; in other words, for the com
plete elimination of spiritual development while on earth.
The belief that we remain in a heaven or a hell for eternity
in exactly the same condition in which we left our mortal state,
and that the only reward for virtue on earth is an easy, calm,
and purposeless existence for ever after, is almost equally per
nicious except to those simple folk who can be frightened by
tales of a devil with a pitchfork roasting them over a -fire, and
who would be satisfied to strum on a harp and flap wings indef
initely if these were given to them.
The person who cannot be frightened by such absurd tales
xiv Introduction
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >■»»»» > »■»■>->■>»■>»■>
and who has a greater ambition than this idea of heaven allows
to him is left stranded with no goal to work toward. Thinking
over the struggles and hardships which have been his in ele
vating himself to his present position, he begins to wonder
whether his gain is equal to the price. If he is to have no greater
rewards for a higher spiritual development after passing over
than one who has lived a calm, aimless life, merely refraining
from wrongdoing, why should he struggle so much harder
while on earth? This logical thought, which comes sooner or
later to every ambitious person, kills any further earthly ef
forts and terminates the good which he could do for the world,
unless he is given a different understanding of his future life.
Spiritualism, by teaching that progress continues eternally
and is greatest for those who work the hardest with love and
for the common good, furnishes a real incentive for any am
bitious individual. It proves its teachings, too, by the superior
intellect and powers evidenced by those in Spirit who come to
communicate with us.
It is this conception of Spiritualism, as a religion of love,
hope, and beauty, that the Stead Center always has taught and
that I pray this book of mine will bring to many people.

EARLY EXPERIENCES
IWAS BORN AND SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IN THE COUNTRY, IN
close touch with nature, learning to know and to love the
animals, the trees, the flowers, and all the many manifestations
of life. I learned what hurt the offspring of God's creation and
what was good for them ; what we had a right to do with them
and what we did not have a right to do. Sometimes it is best
to pluck the flowers because only by doing so will a chance be
given for more flowers to come. Sometimes it is best to kill
certain insects or animals because only by doing so will more
beautiful or useful plants and animals be enabled to live and
give benefit to all.
While quite young and playing by myself most of the time,
occasionally with young neighbors, no particular notice was
taken of me other than that accorded all young children. As
I grew older and told my companions of children playing with
us whom they could not see, and of the beautiful world they
played in, I was laughed at and made fun of. They realized
that I could tell them many remarkable things, but if there
were other children playing with us, why could they not see
them and hear them? If there were beautiful flowers in the
brown and drab hayfield, why could they not see them and
3
4 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>»»>.».>>.>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
smell them? All this I could not answer, but it set me apart
from the rest of the children.
As I grew older and continued to speak of the Spirit friends
to whomever I was with, I received more and more censure,
especially as my friends, to help me defend myself, told me
facts, although unwelcome ones, about my critics which I did
not have the good judgment to keep to myself, but which I told
them with the utmost frankness. This earned me much ill will
and it was many years before I learned that it is an almost
universal human failing for people to dislike those who tell
them unwelcome truths, even when they are told for their own
benefit.
My schooldays opened up another source of trouble for me.
The school-teacher believed all knowledge was to be obtained
from books only, with the possible exception of himself. This
did not seem to trouble the other children, but it was most un
fortunate for me, because I did not like to study and could not
understand such things as the maps in my geography and the
meaningless jumble of figures in my arithmetic. If I was called
upon to give the boundaries of any state, I would do so
promptly and correctly, but often not in the way given in the
book. This aroused my teacher's suspicions, and his ill will
when, after calling me to the map on the wall and asking me
to point out the different boundaries I had named, I could
not even find the state on the map, much less the boundaries!
In the arithmetic class I always had the right answer, no mat
ter how complicated the problem, and had it even before the
problem was fully stated, but I could not show the steps by
which I got this answer and therefore I had not done it in
Early Experiences 5
.<.
the orthodox way, and received reprimands instead of the
compliments I felt I and my Spirit friends who had helped
me deserved. It was a most difficult thing for me to see why
I had to learn a number of rules and steps, which my teacher
said were necessary for the solving of problems, when I always
had the right answer my way and could get it much quicker
than he could by his process. However, in this matter my Spirit
friends disagreed with me and told me I must do my best and
learn all I could in school so that when I grew up I would
understand the knowledge and learning that other people had
as well as that which I received from them. Knowing that they
always were right, I did my best to obey them.
I was sent to Sunday-school, as all well-brought-up children
in the community were and my troubles followed me there.
One day the teacher was telling us about a little playmate who
she said had died a few days before and whom we should never
see again because she was " 'way up high with the angels."
All this time I was looking at the little girl who was sitting
beside the teacher, and as soon as I could, I told everyone that
she was not dead because she was sitting beside the teacher and
looked as well and happy as she ever had before, and her
mamma should be happy too because she was so well. The
teacher was terribly shocked and told me I never should say
such things or contradict her. She had said the little girl was
dead, and so did everybody else except me, and therefore I
must be wrong. I was young and must believe what my elders
told me. This was another lesson about human beings which I
did not learn fully for many years. I knew the child lived be
cause I could see her and talk with her, yet I was considered
6 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
wrong because everybody else said she was dead, and dead she
must be with this weight of public opinion behind the asser
tion.
People, in stating what appear to them to be facts and in
criticizing those who have the temerity to question their state
ments, forget that practically all the world's great discoveries
and inventions have appeared to be contrary to the "facts"
as understood in that particular age. Mere mention of the cen
sure, ridicule, and persecution encountered by Jesus Christ in
giving His belief to the world; Columbus in proposing the
idea that the earth was globular instead of flat ; and Alexander
Bell in stating that two people miles apart could talk to and
hear each other by means of a wire stretched between them,
will recall the truth of this statement.
Some time after this episode we were notified that my grand
mother was quite ill. She always had been good to me and
there was a deep bond of sympathy between us. One day I told
my mother that I thought my grandma was very sick and that
if she did not go to see her very soon, she would not see her
again on this earth. My mother did not like to make the jour
ney unnecessarily, and after getting some clothes ready, re
ceived a telegram telling her that her mother seemed better and
not to hurry. The next night my grandmother came to me and
spoke to me. I told my mother that, instead of taking the beau
tiful maroon dress she had got ready, she had better take a
mourning-dress and start right away, as Grandma was with
the angels. She did not believe me and prepared nothing, but
I later overheard my father saying: "You had better listen
to the child, because you know she always is right in anything
Early Experiences 7
<
of this sort."
Later that same morning a telegram came telling of the
passing of Grandmother that morning at three o'clock. It was
only a few minutes after I had been talking with her in my
bedroom.
Demonstrations such as these, while making people think,
did not convince them of the truth of my beliefs and state
ments about the world to them unseen. Certainly the child
had an uncanny insight into unforeseen events, but how could
all the things she said about that other world and its people be
true? It was all too completely at variance with the beliefs of
the people they knew and all the books they read. But was
this true? Were these statements of mine entirely unique and
original? Most certainly not. These same beliefs have been
held through all recorded history and stated again and again.
The Christian Bible probably is the best-known work in the
world on the subject of life after death and communion of the
so-called dead with the living.
I was misunderstood almost completely in my neighbor
hood, and finally one day a voice told me that I had best leave
and establish myself in a city. "Many people there will not
understand you either," I was told, "but there will be some
who do. Taking everything into consideration, you had best
make the change. We will protect you all the time and see that
no harm comes to you."
So it was that I started out to make my own way.
Establishing oneself in a strange large city when one is
a young unsophisticated country girl with no friends or money
8 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
is a hard and disheartening task. At the most impressionistic
age, when life is just beginning to unfold its mysteries and
when the brightest light and most ambitious dreams come, to
have to face the harsh necessity of finding work in order to
obtain a bite of food, and to meet in this quest the selfish under
hand schemes of some employers to exploit the workers de
pendent upon them, and fellow employees trying to raise
themselves at the expense of others, is to spoil almost inevitably
all the beauty and poetry that life is meant to hold for the
young girl. My Spirit friends guided me with unerring hand
round and past all pitfalls, and whenever any doubt or diffi
culty arose in my mind were at hand to tell me right from
wrong and to advise me what to do. Without this assistance I
might have conducted my life no differently from the girls
with whom I was associated. To a girl placed as I was, but
without the benefit of being able to talk with loved ones in
Spirit, and wishing to lead an upright life and avoid the mis
takes which will cause her future unhappiness, I would say:
rely absolutely on your conscience. The trite saying, much
abused nowadays as a slang phrase, "Let your conscience be
your guide" is nevertheless the best and most concise advice
that can be given to a young person. The conscience, a voice
given by God speaking to the soul, always is right and if lis
tened to will keep anyone in the path that leads to a better un
derstanding of life and will bring the joy which is everyone's
due. The more the conscience is listened to and obeyed, the
stronger it becomes and the clearer it can be understood.
Often for the amusement of the girls I associated with I
would read tea-leaves left in the bottom of tea-cups and tell
Early Experiences 9
< <- < <- <<
them what I saw there. These little messages frequently were
quite remarkable in their accuracy, and some of the girls told
me I was a great medium. I did not know what a medium was
and told them that I was not giving them any messages; I
just felt like telling them certain things when I looked in a
cup, but that was all there was to it.
They laughed at me and said I had a great deal to learn.
Always anxious to increase my knowledge, I asked them
to teach me and to explain what they meant by saying I was a
medium.
They said the best way to find out was to go with them to
a Spiritualistic seance.
This I did, but I saw nothing particularly remarkable in a
woman getting up before a group of people to give certain
of them what she termed "messages" from the Other Side.
I supposed that everybody could talk with their friends in
Spirit as I could.
On the occasion of my third visit this woman was attempt
ing to give a message to a woman who had lost track of her
son for ten years, and seemed to have difficulty doing
it.
Sud
denly
I
felt myself about to have what
I
always had considered
to be
a
"fit." My body became very tense and

lost conscious
ness. When
I
became myself again,
I
hurriedly left the house,
saying to my companions that
I
had been trying for
a
long
time to cure these "fits" and had not had one for quite
a
while.
I
did not want to go back to this woman's home, fearing that
my "fits" would return.
In vain the girls attempted to explain to me that
I
had been
controlled and had given the woman the message that the
10 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>.>>.>>>>>>> >».»»»»
medium could not give her. I understood this "control" busi
ness no more than I did the function of the "medium." The
sight I had always had of those who were supposed to have
"died" and the conversations I held with them were so natural
that I considered them part of everybody's experience and
could not understand what was meant by a medium or the rea
son why people had to go to one to speak to their loved friends
on the Other Side. I did know, however, from sad experience
that telling people about the things I saw and heard brought
me trouble much more than it did joy, and if a medium was one
who made a practice of giving such "messages," I certainly
did not want to be one. My companions told me that I must
have all this explained to me so that I could understand what
it meant, and they thought the best way would be for me to
attend a voice seance where those on the Other Side could talk
the matter over with me and answer my difficulties and mis
understanding.
I finally consented to go with them and made arrangements
to meet them at the voice medium's home the next Wednesday
evening. I arrived, but my friends did not come. I explained
to the woman how I came to be there, and although she was
not cordial, she told me to take a seat in the group sitting in
a half-circle about the chair she would use. When the lights
went out and I found myself in complete darkness among
total strangers, I became very much frightened and this was
increased when I felt myself struck on the knee by one of the
tin horns I had seen in the room when I first came in. Grasping
my chair tightly with both hands, I hung on as to an anchor
connecting me with the world of reality I seemed to have lost
Early Experiences II
«<- <. <.
when the light went out. I uttered no sound and understood
only partially what a voice introduced by the medium as a
"Guide" of hers said after the people present had sung a
hymn. My knee was tapped again, and then a voice close to
me said: "Hello, Angie."
That was my nickname, and the voice was so unmistakably
that of my brother who had passed over years ago that I rec
ognized it immediately and exclaimed: "That is my brother."
I had a short conversation with him, which seemed very
natural. Talking with my Spirit friends was far from alarm
ing, but sitting in a dark room among strangers was another
matter entirely.
When I reached home after the close of the seance, I
thanked God that I had been able to talk with my brother in
a different way from what I had ever done before. No thought
of doubt or skepticism even crossed my mind. I knew my
brother and knew he always was with me, and considered that
God had been especially generous to me in allowing us to talk
with one another in this manner.
So enthusiastic was I about this experience, and so anxious
that others might have the same blessing, that I made up my
mind to call upon some gentlemen from my home town, whom
I knew to be in the city, to tell them all about it. I realized I
stood more than an even chance of being ridiculed by them as
I usually was when telling of such things, but decided to
chance it. To my surprise I found these three dignified gentle
men were Spiritualists and very much interested in what I
told them. I was asked by them to be allowed to accompany
me the next time I went to a seance.
12 The Voice Triumphant

I arranged to go with them the next Friday evening early.
When we arrived at the medium's home, I rang the bell and
greeted her when she appeared at the door. The lack of cor
diality I had noticed in her attitude before seemed increased
a hundredfold when she saw me accompanied by these gentle
men.
"My seance is full and I have no more room," we were told
shortly.
Instantly a vision of her seance room appeared before me
and I saw it was empty. <
"Why," I exclaimed in surprise, "there is no one in your
seance room; it is empty!"
Regarding me in a very unfriendly manner, she hesitated
a moment, then shut the door in our faces without another
word.
I was very much taken aback at this treatment and dis
tressed at wasting the valuable time of these gentlemen on
what had proved to be a wild-goose chase.
"I cannot understand what she means by saying her seance
is full, because I can see that she has no one at all in it as yet,"
I told them, and attempted to apologize for the trouble I had
caused them.
One of the men, a lawyer, laughed and said: "Don't worry
about
it,
little girl; she just did not want to have us in her
seance. That was her way of telling us. You will find out as
you grow older that people often make such excuses instead
of telling the truth."
After reaching home, the more
I
thought about the matter,
the more exercised
I
became.
I
had been trying to help her

as much as the gentlemen I had brought, and instead of being
grateful she had practically insulted us. I made up my mind
to go to see her the next afternoon when I had a half holiday
from my work.
When she appeared at the door in response to my ring, I
told her I wished to ask her why she had not allowed me and
my friends in her seance the evening before.
She said: "I do not want mediums and their friends snoop
ing around my seances. I do not interfere with other mediums
and their work and I do not care to have them interfere
with me."
"But none of us were mediums," I started to explain, but
was interrupted by her amused and doubting laughter.
"Don't try to tell me any such thing as that, because I know
a medium as soon as I see her. You are one and cannot
fool me."
I tried my best to explain to her that I was not a medium and
did not want to be and I told her all the troubles I already had
encountered because of this belief so many of my acquaintances
had about me. After a long discussion she finally realized I was
telling her the truth and that I did not know what power I had.
She said that she would give me a sitting and that her Guides
would try to explain to me the whole situation.
We entered the seance room and were greeted by one of
her Guides, who told her that she had done wrong in refus
ing to admit me the night before, that he had tried to impress
on her that she should allow us to remain, but could not. He
said that I had been born with a wonderful mediumistic gift
and that my Guides were doing their best to induce me to take
14 The Voice Triumphant
»»>»»»»»»»»»»»»»»».»»»>»»
up the work of a medium.
Immediately I raised a protest; I already had got into too
much trouble with this "gift" he was telling me about, and
did not wish any more.
He was quite firm, however, and told me that it was my
duty to God to give the benefit of my power to the world. God
had given me the gift, and it was my obligation in turn to use
it as He wished and intended that I should.
I always had been accustomed to obeying my "voices," as I
called them, and when one in Spirit spoke so strongly, I put up
no further argument. He explained that my work would be
hard and in many cases thankless, but it was my task and I
must perform it. They would help me all of the time and
protect me and I need fear nothing. I was told that at least
one private sitting a week with this medium would be neces
sary for several months to develop my power.
I attended her public seances and my development began.
At the second one several of the Spirit friends used foreign
languages, something that never had occurred in her seances
before, though she had been a medium for fourteen years. Her
Guides explained that they were using my forces to do this,
not hers.
The weeks went by and I became quite a help to her at her
public seances, but did not realize what power I really had.
One day she told me to come to her home, but when I arrived,
I found she had gone out. A woman friend living with her told
me that I was to go into the seance room with a man who had
made an appointment for a sitting. This was one of the gentle
men whom I had brought with me that Friday night weeks
Early Experiences 15
<. <<
ago. He now was a regular attendant at her seances. I said
that there was no use for us to sit alone without the medium,
that we should have no results, but merely waste our time.
Unknown to me, the medium had arranged with this man to
have this sitting to find out how far I had developed, and
consequently he urged me to try the sitting. I told him that if
he could waste his time, I guessed I could afford to waste
mine, and we entered the room.
The sitting began and progressed just as though the me
dium were there. He was elated, but I believed the medium
must be somewhere in the house and her forces were holding
the seances. This man and the woman in the house proved to
me that the medium was not there, but I still could not be
lieve in my own mind that the sitting had been held by means
of my forces.
Soon after this the medium gave me one of her trumpets
to take home with me. I did so and stood it in a corner of my
room. After I went to bed, as soon as the room was dark, the
trumpet began to move and tapped me. In spite of my former
experience I was so frightened that I cried out and roused the
household. My landlady came into the room, and, after tell
ing her what had happened, I got up, put the trumpet in my
trunk, and then locked the trunk. She finally had to sleep with
me that night, I so feared what the trumpet might do. I took it
back next day and said I could not have it in my room.
A few days later I received a request from my landlady to
look for another room. She told me that her priest said I was
an undesirable person for her to have in her house. She had
told him about the trumpet incident.
1 6 The Voice Triumphant
»>»»»•»»>•»»»»»»»»».>.».>.»»»»»
I went to the medium, who now was my friend, and told
her what trouble I was in because of her trumpet.
"You are not in any trouble," she informed me. "I have just
received word that my father is dangerously ill and I must
leave the city at once and go to him. You can have my apart
ment and hold seances in my stead."
I finally decided I might as well take her little apartment
as not, but did not plan to hold any seances.
I moved in and was told by my Guides that I should begin
my work as a medium. I kept putting it off with one excuse or
another until one day I was discharged from my position. My
employer said he had no real reason for letting me go, my
work was all right, but he just had to discharge me. I obtained
and lost several other positions in rapid succession, each em
ployer saying that my work was satisfactory, but that he could
not keep me.
The day after losing the last position I received a letter
from a woman in Milwaukee who had heard about the "child
medium," as I was called, requesting that I come there for a
few weeks to hold seances. She said that she would pay my ex
penses and give me enough more to cover any loss of income
during my visit.
I thought the matter over carefully and came to the con
clusion that my Guides were going to insist that I take up
the work they said was planned for me, and that I had best
start in with no more delay.
I spent five weeks in Milwaukee, holding seances every
night and submitting to all the tests that the people could
think of in order to find out whether my mediumship was gen
Early Experiences 17
<
uine or I was a fraud.
During a seance near the end of the fourth week the Spirit
friends of those present were very strong, speaking in clear,
loud voices and occasionally tapping different people with the
trumpet. I was crouching in a sack made of strong cloth which
was nailed to the floor at the two bottom corners, had been
sewn up across the top after I entered, and was being held at
the two upper corners by a man on each side.
One woman who had attended most of the seances during
my stay had continually asked her daughter if she was out
of purgatory yet. Each time her daughter had told her that
she never had been in purgatory, that she could not find such
a place in the Spirit World. Each time her mother would tell
her that she had paid for another mass and asked her if she was
out yet. This evening when she asked her usual question, the
daughter said: "Mother, I tell you I never was in purgatory,
and you cannot get me out of something I never saw. I am
right here with you," and to emphasize her presence she struck
her mother a resounding blow on the knee with the trumpet.
"Glory be!" shouted the woman ; "the medium is out of
the sack."
My Guide Pat took charge of the seance immediately and
told everyone that never again would they allow me to submit
to any so-called "test" conditions, that, no matter what the test,
certain people would not believe anyway. With that an Indian
Guide grasped the sack, thrust aside the two men who were
holding
it,
tore
it
straight across the top, and stripped
it
off me.
"Never again," said Pat, "will we allow our medium to un
dergo such discomfort and indignities as she has submitted to
1 8 The Voice Triumphant
>»>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.».>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
during these four weeks in the endeavor to prove that com
munication is possible between your world and ours. It is use
less to attempt to prove it to some people, and those who
believe it in future must do so through their powers of reason
ing after witnessing the phenomena of the seance room. We
might allow her to submit to tests before a body of earnest sci
entific investigators who were examining the question critically
and impartially, but we will allow it under no other condi
tions."
The seances I held during the last week of my stay were
conducted while I sat with a little dignity and considerably
more comfort in a chair, not tied hand and foot, nor gagged,
nor with my mouth full of flour, nor in any of the other multi
tude of ways I had submitted to previously.
After returning home I made up my mind to follow the
course my Guides said was laid out for me, and began my se
rious work as a medium before the public.

MY GUIDES
BEFORE
BEGINNING THE ACCOUNT OF THE MANY EXPERI-
ences of the seance room and the lessons to be learned from
them, I will give short sketches of my different Guides and
the particular work they love to do. Everybody has Spirit
Guides, usually twelve in number, who give all the help and
happiness which will be accepted and do this through the
bond of love uniting them with the one who is the object of
their solicitude. Through the Law of Attraction, the more
highly developed spiritually an individual
is,
the higher the
plane from which his Guides come. Which ones he attracts
depends largely upon the particular earthly interests of the
person,
a
physician receiving help from those interested in the
various sciences contributing to his profession, an artist receiv
ing help from those continuing their artistic careers in Spirit,
and
a
medium receiving help from those who can assist her in
carrying on her work.
All mediums, particularly those through whom physical
phenomena are demonstrated
(I
am of this kind), have
a
Guide who
is
called the "Chemist." He
is
a
Master Guide
and very highly developed, having been many years on
the Other Side, and has learned the beautiful laws governing
19
20 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
communication. As nearly as I understand his work, it is a com
bination of physics and chemistry, the forces he deals with lying
at the point where the two sciences meet and join. Before a
seance of any sort can be started, this Guide must so arrange
his materials and so work with them that what he calls "the
Forces" are built up to the point where communication can
take place. What actually goes on we do not know and prob
ably could not explain anyway, because there would be no words
in existence on earth to describe this unknown phenomenon. I
should like, however, to combine what few facts we do know
into a suggestive, although very incomplete, explanation which
will assist one to a proper approach to the seance room, but
which most emphatically must not be considered a complete or
definite elucidation.
We are aware through scientific research that the atoms of
the ninety-odd chemical elements we know of on earth are
composed of a nucleus and electrons which are essentially
of the same kind in all the atoms. The difference between the
elements lies in the number of electrons present and the pat
tern in which they vibrate within the atom. These elements
could be changed one into another if it was possible to rear
range the electrons, and it is conceivable that a rearrangement
could result also in bodies unknown on earth. Any of these
changes would be accompanied, or produced, by changes in vi
bration of the electrons, which in turn would necessitate an
exchange of energy. Energy of some sort undoubtedly would
be absorbed in the process and would have to come from some
source.
We are aware that harmonious thought conditions are ab
My Guides 21
<-
solutely essential to a seance, and that one individual with a
mean or contrary attitude, among forty others who are in con
cord with each other, can ruin the seance. This shows the posi
tive force of thoughts or thought vibrations.
It is common knowledge that various types of energy can
alter physical manifestations of different sorts. Consider the
change in direction of a stream of electrons under the in
fluence of magnetic force, or the obliteration of radio waves by
the rays of the sun. Consider also how tones coming through
a radio set are distorted until they are unrecognizable when
the wave carrying the electrical impulse which produces them
is interfered with by another wave slightly different in char
acter. Unharmonious thoughts in the room in a similar way
interfere with or actually interrupt the flow of energy coming
from the medium.
We must remember, too, that some forms of energy are
transmitted better in the absence of light—for example, radio
waves—and that many chemical reactions either do not pro
gress at all in the light or are accelerated to such an extent
that they cannot be controlled. An example of the first re
action is the failure of chlorophyl to synthesize plant material
from carbon dioxide and water when no light is present; of
the second reaction, the union of hydrogen and chlorine with
explosive violence in the sunlight.
After a seance a medium is tired, physically and mentally,
indicating a loss of material or energy, or both, from her body.
Assembling now our little body of facts and the deductions
from them, we can build up a picture somewhat as follows to in
dicate what takes place when our friends in Spirit communicate
22 The Voice Triumphant
>.»>>.>.>->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>>>>>»>
with us. If we assume that their spiritual bodies and the
worlds in which they live are composed of atoms made up
of nuclei and electrons in arrangements differing from those
on earth and unperceivable by our physical senses, in order
that they may make themselves perceptible we must admit a
change in our physical senses or a rearrangement of electrons
into atoms of a sort which are evident to us. The latter appears
to be the more reasonable to me in view of the other facts.
This rearrangement probably requires the absorption of some
sort of energy which a medium is fitted to supply to a greater
degree than other mortals, although all present in a seance
contribute some small portion to this work. If we picture, then,
the Chemist building up his Forces by taking energy from
the medium and the members of the seance in order to trans
form spiritual atoms into physical ones, we can understand
how this supply of energy must be continuous throughout the
seance, why unharmonious thoughts can interrupt its flow, and
why it takes place better in the dark than in the light.
This flow of energy proceeds steadily in the dark during
the seance until the Chemist ceases to draw it. If, however, a
light is turned on during the time it is flowing, it is stopped
instantly with resulting disastrous effects on the medium. It
may be likened, although it is much more intensified, to the
abrupt stoppage of an electrical current flowing from a gen
erator. The generator is burned out in a very short time if
power still is supplied to
it,
because the electrical energy
it
is
generating has no outlet. The interruption of the flow of
energy from the medium renders her instantly unconscious
and possibly kills her physical body.
My Guides 23
<■
(I will mention later several instances where light has been
flashed on me in a seance.)
This explanation of what actually goes on in order that com
munication can take place is necessarily incomplete and pos
sibly inaccurate in details, but it fits the few facts we do know
and explains why certain conditions must be met by the me
dium and the sitter before communication can be established.
It gives a logical reason for the absence of light; for the known
physical injury to the medium if a light is turned on while
the seance is in progress; for the necessity of harmonious
thoughts in the minds of all present; for the open mind re
quired of those who are attending a seance for the first time;
and for the difficulty of holding a seance during natural dis
turbances such as thunder-storms.
My Chemist never has spoken at a seance ; possibly he can
not do so while carrying on his work; but he frequently speaks
to me personally, advising and warning me. He is very firm
and tells me but once about any incident. Unlike most other
Guides, he gives me no reasons for his advice. He gives me
explicit directions only, and sad the day for me if I forget
or do not heed him.
Snowdrop is a young woman who assists during a voice
seance. She instructs and aids those on the Other Side who are
unused to communicating, to reach their friends of this side,
and helps the latter to recognize them. She frequently is called
upon to give the name of the Spirit friend when he cannot
do so himself because of unfamiliarity with the Forces or
because of the barrier his earth friend has raised through
24 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>>>>>
skepticism or ignorance of Spiritual laws. She gives many tests,
usually short, but very much to the point, to clear away ob
stacles caused by skepticism. She sings in a wonderfully sweet
voice and composes poems, contributing greatly to the beauty
and enjoyment of a seance. Her lessons and sweet, understand
ing advice to those in trouble truly are God-sent and priceless
in the help and comfort they bring. She is beloved by all who
have had the privilege of talking to her and receiving her help.
Pat is a natural, jolly Irishman who also assists during a
voice seance. Thousands of people have heard him and en
joyed the jokes he tells. Some people have said: "A spirit
jokes? Why should one do that? Surely they must have more
important things to do in the Spirit World than to think up
jokes for the entertainment of mortals."
Oftentimes a large gathering of strange people has rendered
the progress of the seance almost impossible. Even when no
mean or definitely skeptical persons are present, the individ
ual thoughts are so diverse—some being very sanctimonious,
some thinking of personal affairs outside the seance room,
some intensely desiring their own friends in Spirit to come to
them—that disharmony results. A pointed joke by Pat almost
invariably brings everyone's thoughts into the same channel
and clears the heavy atmosphere, allowing the seance to con
tinue with new force.
Pat has proved a wonderful adviser in business and other
affairs of earth life. He always has said that everything be
longs to God and only has been lent us to use and manage
to the best of our ability for the purpose of helping others and
My Guides 25
<-
improving and developing our own souls. Business and the
management and proper use of the resources of earth are as
much a part of God's plan as any other human activity, spirit
ual or physical, and as necessary for our soul's development.
Consequently any help we can receive from the Other Side
is perfectly proper and should be used to the greatest degree
possible. Pat always has loved business and enjoys assisting
others in conducting
it;
the larger and more important
it
is,
the better. His continual development shows him more plainly
all the time that all of us are doing the work of God. He says:
"You are children working
in
the vineyard of this little earth
and we are messengers from God and the higher worlds to help
you. My specialty
is
business and
I
love to help those engaged
in
it."
Pat's advice never has proved wrong, but many have not
taken
it
and later have come to tell me that they wished they
had done so.
Prophet
is
a
young woman Guide who came to me first about
1
9
13 as
a
control. We know nothing about her personal his
tory, as she never holds
a
conversation with anyone or tells
anything about herself. She has told us she wishes to be known
as "Prophet" and in no other way. She comes during the
month of December and gives
a
prophecy about the coming
year; the condition of business; natural disasters threatening
different parts of the world, such as fires, floods, shipwrecks,
hurricanes, earthquakes, etc.; the passage of notable people to
the Other Side
;
the discovery of natural resources which will
develop particular parts of the country; and many other
26 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
events. During the World War she came rather frequently
and not only told about the positions occupied by the various
armies, but what their next objectives were and whether they
would achieve them or not.
So many people misunderstand prophesying and confuse it
with fortune-telling that our friends in Spirit are very reluctant
to attempt to bring this help to us. True prophecies are of great
value to us in conducting our earthly affairs, but so often does
cheap fortune-telling mislead people that our Guides hesitate
to give us a prophecy, knowing that it is likely to be misun
derstood.
Many people for some reason or other, such as deafness,
fear of the dark, etc., prefer receiving their messages through
a Spirit control of the medium instead of by direct voice. At
such times my Guide Bright Eyes takes control of me and
through my physical body transmits the messages from those
on the Other Side. At such a time Bright Eyes is the real me
dium, she is using my body while my soul and mind are exist
ing separate from it. She uses a loud, clear voice, which, I am
told, differs from mine considerably, and has the strength to
bring messages even to an unreasonable skeptic, should there
exist any reason why the Spirit World wishes such a one to
have a message.
A very important task of Bright Eyes is that of conducting
our work of giving messages by mail. Anyone, whether a
friend of the Stead Center or a total stranger, writing to me
asking questions which he wishes his loved ones in Spirit to
answer is given a message by Bright Eyes just as though he
My Guides 27
<
were present in person. Her answers and advice are taken
down by a competent stenographer and then transcribed and
sent as a letter. When a person is present at a sitting in which
Bright Eyes controls me, he asks his questions directly of her.
When he writes in, he must ask questions in the same way.
One reason for doing this, which holds only for written mes
sages, is that a letter brings with it many conditions other than
that of the writer, and sometimes it is principally through the
answers to the questions contained in it that Bright Eyes knows
she is giving the message to the proper person.
Pink Rose is another Guide who gives her messages through
her control of me. She very seldom comes to individuals or
small groups of people. Her work consists principally in giv
ing lectures to large audiences and short messages to individ
uals in the audience. She conducts marriage ceremonies and
christening and funeral services, giving beautiful advice and
consolation to those present.
For some years certain members of the Stead Center formed
a class which gathered for a seance once a month at which they
received the teachings, collected in our book God's World,
from the Master Guides whom we learned to know as the
Teachers. These Souls all have been many years in the Spirit
World, some of them from periods before recorded history,
and have advanced far. They came to give to us, and to the
world at large through us, the benefit of the knowledge they
had obtained during their years of study and advancement.
Most beautiful and helpful is their philosophy, as all will
agree who have read it.
28 The Voice Triumphant
.>>>>>>>».>.>.»>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>
For a great many years Friday evening has been set aside by
our Guides as healing-night. Men who were doctors on earth
and are continuing this work on the Other Side use the Forces
of the seance this night to heal and assist those on earth who are
ill. Of course it is well known that there is no sickness in the
Spirit World, but the study of medicine and of healing is neces
sary in order to give assistance to our doctors of the earth plane
when we become ill. Wonderful has been the advice and help
given by these doctors in Spirit, as the chapter on "Healing"
will make evident. It will be observed there and must be em
phasized here that Spiritual healing, while indispensable, in
many cases must be complemented by physical healing and the
assistance of doctors on the earth plane. We have been taught
that the passive resignation of those suffering from broken
bones or deep wounds of skin and tissue or other similar disa
bilities to the idea: "My Guides are helping me, I will be
healed" is wrong. Faith is essential and exemplary, but physi
cal assistance must be given to our Spirit doctors when neces
sary. They are the first to advise an operation when it is needed,
and the help of our physicians on earth when it is required.
I myself frequently am advised by my Guides to go to a
physician and can say truthfully that I often have received very
essential help from them. This is true of those sincere men who
have the welfare of their patient at heart and who have a real
understanding of their mission in life and the responsibility
resting upon them. Such men receive a great deal of assistance
from their confreres in Spirit and accomplish great good.
Neither in this field nor in any other is human activity or
effort belittled by our Spirit friends ; all, spiritual and physical,

is an integral part of God's great pattern of life and experience
and indispensable to its fullest development.
Many people whom I never have seen, but who have been
in communication with the Center, sit in their own homes on
Friday night in loving concentration on their friends in Spirit
and have received great help in illness and pain, as their letters
to me afterwards have testified. Our doctors in Spirit through
the Forces built up in our seance room are able to carry their
help to these far-distant and separated homes and demonstrate
the love and solicitude they have for all of us when we permit
them to do so.
I believe that most of my readers, if not all, are well ac
quainted with the work Mr. W. T. Stead did while on earth.
He was traveler; journalist; publisher; founder and head of
Julia's Bureau, an institution where those seeking messages
from their friends in the Spirit World could receive them from
reliable mediums; and man of many other activities. One of
the objects of his last projected visit to America, almost at the
start of which he went down with the Titanic, was a trip to see
me, the young medium he had heard so much about from com
mon friends in London. It was his intention to try to induce me
to return to London with him to assist in the conduct of Julia's
Bureau, but it was not decreed that we should meet in the
flesh.
Twenty-four hours after his ship had gone to the bottom,
he came to my seance room while I was giving a sitting to
an Englishwoman. His plan while in the flesh to visit me was
still uppermost in his mind after he had passed over. He told
30 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>>>>
us that he had not suffered as the others on the ship had when
it sank. He realized soon after the boat had struck that noth
ing could save it and retired to his stateroom, where he
prayed to God to help the others and asked his Guides to
release his soul from his body with as little pain as possible. He
sat calmly, waiting for the transition, sending loving thoughts
to his friends and asking help for his fellow voyagers who were
not so fortunate as he in having a beautifully sustaining belief
in Spiritualism. Before the water touched him, his Guides
liberated his soul from his earthly body and spared him the
suffering of drowning.
He told us that he immediately recognized what had oc
curred, and after greeting his friends who were there to receive
him he appeared outside the ship and found many souls, who
had just passed over, dazed and wandering aimlessly about on
top of the waves or trying desperately to crowd into the life
boats, not realizing what had happened to them. He set to
work to try to help them understand, as he saw many others of
those in Spirit were doing. His previous knowledge of the
Truth had prepared him for all this and he was able to begin
his work without any delay.
At another seance a few days later he told me I should
form an organization in order to carry on my work more effec
tively and to establish a recognized center from which advice
and help could be obtained by those in need, and instructions
and teachings could be given to the world.
I did not understand what he meant by this, thinking that
my work consisted solely in holding seances. After several
months of insistence and explanation on his part I began to
My Guides 31
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ < < < < <
realize that Spiritualism was much more than a mere holding
of seances. It was a religion, greatly misunderstood and sorely
in need of clarification and elucidation to the world at large. So
many were the charlatans who had worked under its name, and
so many were the undeveloped mediums who had not the real
spiritual force to combat and clear up these conditions, that
it had come into disrepute with thinking people. This ignominy
was increased at every opportunity by those religions and those
self-seekers who understood what it really stood for and feared
it because of the liberation through truth and enlightenment
it would bring to those upon whose subjection through igno
rance their power rested. Spiritualism has to fight all the forces
of ignorance and greed outside itself and undevelopment of
its adherents and charlatanism within.
Mr. Stead understood all this and was anxious to begin work
to correct these unhappy conditions. When I finally realized
the plan he had formed, I assembled my friends and we formed
the organization which is named after its moving spirit and
founder, Mr. Stead.
We since have incorporated the W. T. Stead Center of Soul
Communion in several states as a religious organization, not
for profit, and have tried for years to raise Spiritualism to the
dignity rightfully belonging to
it,
through the wonderful
mediumship God has blessed me with, through the publication
of the teachings given us
by
the Master Guides,
by
giving
messages
by
mail to those unable to visit me personally, and
finally
by
the publication of this book, which
I
hope will give
many people
a
different understanding of our religion. In
short, under the guidance of Mr. Stead, we have been trying
32 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
for all these years to bring to as many people as possible, by
every means in our power, the understanding, the comfort,
and the joy that Spiritualism is capable of when comprehended
fully.
There is nothing new about Spiritualism, nothing radical,
nothing complicated nor fearsome. As taught by our Master
Guides, it is a very simple religion, one which teaches that God,
as guiding spirit of the universe, has created souls who must
develop by labor and love, and that this development is con
tinuous whether the soul is on earth or in some other part of
the universe. As all is part of a coherent whole, communication
and understanding between different souls are necessarily pres
ent. It is only because of our ignorance and digression from the
plan God has laid out that it is necessary for us who are on
earth to have a medium present in order that we may talk to
those who have advanced further than we have. Communica
tion between souls, no matter where they are, is as natural as
communication between mortals.
We are taught that Love and Harmony are the greatest
forces in the universe, and that labors conducted in strict accord
with them bring development to the soul and the supreme hap
piness which we all seek.
We do not recognize any heavens, hells, purgatories, and so
forth as places of abode for those passing through the change
called death. Reward of proper living on earth is contentment
and happiness because of the soul's progress. Punishment of
wrongdoing on earth consists solely, but is felt acutely, in un-
happiness at lack of progress, remorse, and correcting the
wrongs done.
My Guides 33

We are taught that there is no such thing as evil. There is
ignorance and there is lack of good, but there is no such thing as
a devil or evil spirts or evil deeds.
All of the points brought out in this brief summary appear
again and are explained more fully in the experiences which
follow.

SNOWDROP
Maid of the unseen world next door,
Where hearts are true and love can't die,
Where patience knows no dawn or dusk,
Maid of the world beyond our sky,
I wonder,
If I were you and you were me,
Part marl, part spirit, such as I,
And mine were the power to clearly see
Down deep through hearts, while you must die,
I question
That I could come to the folk of earth,
And day by day could meet my task,
And bring the courage and cheer and love
And find each soul behind each mask
As you do!
Pal of the plane beyond our ken,
If I could see as well as hear,
Great strength might come to me some day
And give me the courage to call you dear,
Snowdrop!

TESTS
IN
DEMANDING "TESTS" OF THEIR SPIRIT FRIENDS, MORTALS
should realize that they throw a barrier about themselves
which is very difficult for their friends to penetrate. They de
feat their very object by a positive, commanding attitude which
renders communication almost impossible. The vibrations they
send out are so at variance with the condition of loving harmony
which is necessary for communication that they not only cut
themselves off from
it,
but, sometimes, throw the medium out
of tune and render the progress of the seance impossible. Tests
without end are given when, they least are expected because
those on the Other Side wish to give us tests, they wish to con
vince us of their actuality, but, living superior to us as they do,
they cannot be commanded
by
us. Natural law does not permit
such an inversion of the proper order.
It
is
just as absurd to
expect this as
it
would be for some urchin to step up to the
capitalist alighting from his limousine and say: "They tell me
you are
a
rich man. Prove
it
to me
by
taking
a
million dollars
out of your pockets." That the urchin has no right to command
we all concede. He has not the right to specify the kind of proof
of the man's wealth.
It
is
conceivable that the capitalist could
take two million dollars' worth of bonds out of his pocket, but
37
38 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»■»»»»
that is not the proof asked for. We would consider the man
justified in ignoring the urchin's existence.
An analogous situation arises when a mortal demands proof
from his Spirit friends, only they do not ignore him; they do
their best to give some proof from the charity they have for
the mortal's ignorance. The proof, however, almost invariably
is different from that which is asked.
To illustrate tests which come thus, unexpectedly, let me
relate the following:
A young girl attended two public seances and was addressed
presumably by her brother, but the voice was so low that the
words were indistinct. The girl was skeptical and raised a bar
rier which her brother could not penetrate with a more distinct
message. Her interest, however, when she came a second, then
a third, time, evidently deserved reward from the Spirit
World, for her brother this time came and said in a clear voice:
"Sis, this is Boots."
Her recognition was complete and instantaneous, and with
the removal of the obstacle of her skepticism she received a
very comforting message from her brother.
The young man told me afterwards that he had been trying
hard to think of some way to convince his sister, but was ham
pered by her attitude. If he could get through this sufficiently
to speak clearly to her, he knew he could give her plenty of
tests. The breaking through was the difficult part. Finally he
remembered that when a child on a farm, he had been so inor
dinately fond of a pair of rubber boots that the family had
given him the nickname "Boots." Such a test was all the girl
Tests 39
<««
needed to make her open up her mind and greet him frankly.
Further proof then was easy for him to give.
A member of the Center sent a friend to one of my public
seances. This man, who knew nothing of Spiritualism, was the
"smart Aleck" type. His father in Spirit came to him, speaking
in his native German tongue. Our smart friend asked his father
to have his mother speak to him. His father then spoke very
gravely and in English so that all could understand. He said:
"Son, do not try to trick God. Your mother will be with me
soon enough as it
is,
without your pretending she
is
here now."
The father would say no more and left. It seems that this
young man loved his mother very much and was somewhat
uneasy about the message, although he had no belief in its
source.
The next morning his mother dropped dead, her heart fail
ing her.
A
changed and very contrite young man hurried to
talk to his father in Spirit and to beg forgiveness
if
he had even
partly caused his mother's sudden passing
by
his flippant re
mark of the evening before. He was told that his mother's time
had come, that he had not
in
any way caused her passing, but
that her loss to him was his punishment for attempting to trick
God.
It
seems needless to say that this man received
a
test that
he never forgot, and that he did not need others to convince
him the Spirit World was peopled with very real beings who
knew much more than he did.
On another occasion an old couple on the first visit to me at
tended
a
public seance. They came
in
love and with hearts open
40 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»»»»»»»» »■>■> > >■»■»»»»-»■>■>■>
to receive any blessing the Spirit World might have in store
for them. Soon after the seance opened, a childish voice
greeted us.
"Hello, Grandpa, this is Dorothy and I want some
'chocky.'
»
The old folks exclaimed with joy. Fairly shouting, the
grandfather cried: "Oh, Dorothy, it always was 'chocky' with
you, not chocolate."
"Well, I like to say it that way," was Dorothy's pert
reply.
Is not this a simple but very convincing little test? How
could anyone in the room know that these two old folks had
a granddaughter in Spirit who pronounced that particular
word in that peculiar way?
One man who occasionally attended my seances had a beau
tiful test one evening although he had passed the stage where
tests were necessary. During the course of the seance one of
my circle Guides spoke to him and said: "A Spirit comes to
you and shows me a little cottage covered all over with flowers.
A path leads down from it to a wall in which is a gate against
which she leans. She is looking down the road, apparently at
someone who is starting on a journey."
The man spoke up immediately: "That must be my mother.
That is exactly the way I saw her last, as I was leaving home
to come to America. I have not thought of her at the gate in
twenty years."
Such a test is a beautiful proof of a person's identity and cer
tainly cannot be explained by mind-reading or any chicanery.
Tests 41
<«
In illustration of the way tests come to people who do not
demand them, I recall those received by a Swedish couple in
Chicago. They were staunch and active members of one of the
orthodox churches, the gentleman holding an office in the
church. Investigation of psychic phenomena was unknown to
them.
One day the lady sat down to write a letter to her mother
in Sweden, but instead of writing a letter she received auto
matic writing. Considerably surprised and puzzled, she told
some of her friends of her experience. Among them happened
to be one who was acquainted with Spiritualism and she sug
gested to the lady that a visit to me might furnish an explana
tion. She came and had a very pleasant visit with her son and
daughter in Spirit. She began coming for private sittings rather
frequently, but could not induce her husband to accompany her.
One Sunday evening when there happened to be no church
services or meeting, they were entertaining some friends, and
the man suddenly got the idea of coming to one of my public
seances, which he knew were held on Sunday. Telling his wife
he had to see a man on business, he departed, thinking that in
this way and by making up his mind so quickly surely no word
about him could possibly precede him.
Soon after the seance began, his daughter greeted him and
said: "You think you have put something over on Mamma,
don't you?
" and then went on to tell him what he had done.
Later his son came and after greeting him said: "You think
you put something over on Mamma, but I am going to tell her
you have been here this evening and she will know it before
you get home."
42 The Voice Triumphant
.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»».>.>».>.>»
His wife, after her guests had left rather early in the eve
ning, decided to try to get a message through her automatic
writing. She did, immediately. Her son wrote that his father
had attended a public seance, trying to fool her. When the man
reached home, his wife greeted him with the news that she
knew where he had been because their son had come to her and
told her.
It is quite evident this woman had considerable psychic
power. Otherwise she never would have received such definite
messages in this manner. She did not sit for development ; her
Guides used the power she had when they were ready to do so,
even though she knew nothing about it or about Spiritualism.
I shall have more to say about this later.
The double test this man received was sufficient to con
vince him and he became a very staunch and loyal Spirit
ualist.
This is another instance were it is proved that a person can at
tend his first seance with any possible feeling of curiosity or
desire to find out what it all is about and obtain convincing re
sults. No previous belief is necessary; only a mind open to ad
mit whatever blessings may be offered. The preconceived con
viction that Spiritualism is not true and an attitude which
demands tests are the forces which build the impenetrable wall
about the individual. Very few problems are solved by one who
attacks them with the thought "It cannot be done" or "It is not
so." They must be approached with an open mind in order that
apparently insignificant clues may not be overlooked, or the
true road to the solution be not passed, by too intent following
of the path originally started on.
Tests 43
<
A man and his wife had attended a few seances and received
tests sufficient to convince them of the truth. One evening a
Spirit friend came to the man and said: "How are you, D. E? I
am your Uncle Robert."
After conversing for a few minutes, the uncle departed.
When the seance was over, the man told me that he had an
Uncle Robert, but did not know that he had passed over.
The following Sunday this man and his wife went to visit his
mother, who was sick, and, noticing on her dresser a picture of
his uncle, said: "Mother, that is a fine picture of Uncle Robert."
"Yes," she replied, "it is. By the way, I had a letter from
him just the other day, saying he feels fine."
This naturally upset the man considerably, because he had
come to believe in his Spirit friends only recently and, if his
uncle really was still in this world, his message had been false.
There being time yet to attend the Sunday evening seance, he
and his wife hurried over.
Soon after it started, the same voice came to him and said:
"Well, D. E., you seem to be in a quandary and I will help
you out so that your mind will be at ease. I am your Uncle
Robert, but the Uncle Robert you know is still with you on
earth. I passed over to the Spirit World in infancy, but already
had been given our family name of Robert. When the next
boy was born to Mother, he also was given the same name to
preserve it in the family. Next time you visit your mother, I
want you to ask her about this so that you will be satisfied."
Soon after this they again visited his mother, and during the
conversation his wife asked her how many children there were
in her family. Counting them on her fingers and calling them
44 The Voice Triumphant
.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
by name in rotation she proceeded until she came to the name
Robert. "The first boy called Robert died in infancy, so when
the next came, he was called Robert also to preserve the family
name." This man never again doubted anything told him by
his friends in Spirit.
One evening in New York a stranger came to my seance
room. Although he never had attended a seance before, he
received several beautiful messages from his loved ones. After
that he came by himself several times, then brought his wife
and a friend. When Bright Eyes took control of me at this last
sitting, she said : "John, your father is here."
"Why, there must be some mistake about that, Bright Eyes,
because my father is living."
"Well," answered Bright Eyes, "he looks like you and says
he is your father."
The man's wife then remarked: "Of course it couldn't be
your father, because he is not in Spirit, and anyway he does not
look like you."
Bright Eyes, realizing she probably had said more than she
should, replied: "Perhaps I have made a mistake ; I guess it
is not your father."
The man said nothing more, but the next day returned by
himself for a sitting. Bright Eyes gave him the same message,
adding that his father had passed over when a rather young
man. "You know," said Bright Eyes, "this reminds me of a
story Pat tells about an Irishman who visited a medium and
told her he wanted proof that there was truth in this idea of
communication between the earth and the Spirit World. He
Tests 45
<
wanted to know where his father was.
"The medium told him his father was in Oklahoma.
" 'Sure, and now I know it is a fake, because I was talking to
my father here in Chicago less than an hour ago.'
" 'Well,' said the medium, 'your mother's husband may be
in Chicago, but your father is in Oklahoma.' "
"That is exactly right, Bright Eyes," exclaimed the man,
and he went on to explain that his father had not married his
mother, but that she had married another man before her baby
was born, and he always had regarded her husband as his
father until he had grown to young manhood and learned the
truth. His wife did not know the story, and his mother, who
was in Europe, did not know that he knew it.
All this took place between Bright Eyes and him, and of
course I knew nothing about
it,
until one day he came to me and
said: "Medie,
I
have something
I
want to get off my chest.
I
have been thinking about
it
for some time."
He then went on to tell me what had taken place at his
private sitting with Bright Eyes. "You know
a
man would
have to be insane not to believe this Truth after such
a
message.
My wife does not know anything about this, and my mother
does not know that
I
do.
It
rarely occurs to me and
I
certainly
was not thinking about
it
when Bright Eyes spoke to me."
Three gentlemen once came to me and told me that they
were church people, believed absolutely in God, and loved
Him and every right thing in life as nearly as they understood
the right. This was to be their first experience in communi
cating with the Spirit World, and, while they understood
46 The Voice Triumphant
»»»■>■»»»»»»»»■»»»»»»»■>■>■>»»»
nothing about
it,
they came with open minds.
I
told them that
nothing more could be asked of them and we would have
a
sitting.
Soon after the light had been turned out,
a
childish voice
said: "O Daddy, O Daddy, this in Linese. You know that
if
I
were in your world today,
I
should be twelve years old.
I
left
you when
a
wee baby, but you know we grow here in Spirit
just as you do on earth. Uncle
is
with me."
It seems that this uncle, who was her father's brother, had
suggested her peculiar name, that of
a
certain family of flowers,
thinking how beautiful
it
would be for
a
little girl to have that
name. The child told about her tiny casket and where
it
was
buried.
All her father could do was sit there and shed tears of joy as
he exclaimed: "How wonderful!"
He told me he never thought of this little girl; that she had
passed over when so young that he practically had forgotten
her. Her name was right, her age was right, where her body
was buried was right. This was as much of
a
test for the two
gentlemen, his dear friends, with him as
it
was for him, because
they also knew all about the child. After this many of their
loved ones came and they had
a
beautiful sitting. Results like
this are received
by
anyone who comes to
a
good medium with
real love and
a
sincere desire to speak to his dear ones who
have gone before.
A
test given to
a
mother unasked proved of inestimable
value to her in
a
crisis. This woman had been coming to my
seances for
a
long time and was accustomed to ask help of her
Tests 47
< < .<*- < < < < < < < .<*- < < < < < <
.<*- < < < < < < < < < < < <
Guides whenever she was in difficulty. She had two daughters,
of whom she thought the world and all. One of these was on
the boat Eastland when it toppled over at its dock in the Chi
cago River some years ago. Witnesses told her they had seen
the girl go down, but the mother could not find her. She had
been to the morgue and viewed all of the bodies, but could not
recognize that of her daughter. Of course, many were almost
beyond recognition, and her failure was not unnatural.
In her great grief and trouble she came for a sitting. Her
daughter greeted her immediately and said : "Yes, Mother, I
was thrown into the water and drowned. You looked at my
body, but did not recognize it. If you will go back to the
morgue, I will see that you find it." She told her mother in
exactly what part of the room it lay, and added: "Don't you
remember, Mother, that I had no navel?"
Her mother went back to the morgue, found the body in
the place described by her daughter, and asked to see the ab
domen. It was her daughter's body.
At one time it was Snowdrop's custom to come in at a public
seance and ask the people if they had any questions which they
would like to have her answer. They could ask anything they
wished and she would investigate and report what she found
out.
One Wednesday evening she did this and a woman asked
her if it made any difference in what part of the world the sub
ject of the question was.
Snowdrop told her it did not, because she could see every
place.
48 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The woman then said that she had arrived in Chicago that
morning, coming from Los Angeles, where she had been the
last two months nursing an uncle who was sick. When she left,
his condition was so improved that she considered him out of
any danger. She wanted to know how he was now, and asked
Snowdrop if she needed the address of the home. Snowdrop
replied that it would save her time to have it.
About twenty minutes later she returned and said: "That
man has passed over."
"Oh, no," replied the woman, "I do not think so."
"Well, you know it took you some time to come here from
Los Angeles, and a great deal might happen in that time."
The woman said that she surely would have received a tele
gram if he had passed.
Snowdrop told her that it looked to her as though he had
just passed over, had been gone but an hour or so, but to make
sure she would go back to Los Angeles and look again. When
she returned later, she said that she was positive it was the
woman's uncle, and described him. She described the aunt and
the home and said the man's body was lying on a bed covered
by a sheet.
Everybody present was much interested and made arrange
ments to be present the next Wednesday evening to hear what
the woman found out in the mean time. The next day she re
ceived a night letter telling her everything just as Snowdrop
had said.
On another occasion Snowdrop was asked by a woman to de
scribe things at her home. Snowdrop could find nothing of
Tests 49
<
interest until she looked in the basement and saw that the fam
ily cat had just had a litter of kittens. She reported this, to the
amusement of everyone present, except her questioner, who
could see nothing laughable about the matter. To her it was a
very important and interesting message.
Many critics of Spiritualism, especially those who have a
more or less exalted opinion of their importance in the world's
affairs, have much to say about what they are pleased to call
the trivial messages brought by those on the Other Side. They
seem unable to grasp the fact that importance, like beauty, is
relative and not absolute; it depends upon the mental and
spiritual development of the individual and the environment
in which he is placed. The things directly affecting his interest
and well-being are the things which are of importance to him.
Those in Spirit are fully aware of this and are charitable enough
to bring us messages which we can understand and which affect
our personal interests. Of what concern or benefit to this woman
would a message have been which informed her that the peo
ple in the kingdom of Poovoodoo were dissatisfied with their
government and were contemplating the establishment of a
republic? This might be very important news to some people,
bankers for instance, but to her it would have meant just
nothing.
A test coming to a woman one afternoon in my seance room
came so unexpectedly and was of such a nature that it almost
resulted disastrously for me. I was having my home decorated
and, while all the workmen had been warned about opening
the seance-room door, one either forgot or made a mistake.
50 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>■>>>>>>>>>->»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»»
Whatever the cause, in the midst of a sitting I was giving to a
woman, the door was opened, suddenly letting in the light. Be
fore the forces were broken, the woman saw distinctly the two
trumpets suspended in mid air, with no visible support. They
dropped immediately of course. As for me, I was rendered
unconscious instantly, but, owing to the facts that the light was
not especially bright, that I was not sitting directly in its path,
and that the workman closed the door quickly as he realized
his mistake, I recovered in a short time. I was too weak to hold
any further sittings that day and was careful to lock the door
at subsequent ones as long as the workmen remained in the
house. Tests of this sort may be wonderfully convincing to the
sitter, but they are entirely too dangerous for the medium.
A mother in Chicago was happy in having two grown sons
who were devoted to her. One of the boys, Charlie, about
twenty-six years old, suddenly became very ill and passed to
the Spirit World two weeks later. His mother's grief was acute
until she heard of my work and came for a seance. Her boy
came to her and she accepted him immediately. Her grief
passed so rapidly that it was noticed by her other son, a pro
fessional ventriloquist.
"Mother," he said, "something has happened, you don't
seem as unhappy as you were."
"Yes, my boy," she replied, "something has happened." She
went on to explain to him how she had found a way to speak to
his brother and what comfort it was to her.
In spite of his love for her, which should have made him
glad that she had found consolation in her sorrow, he laughed
Tests 51
< <«««« <««««« ««.<.«. <«««« <««««« ««.<.«.
and said the whole thing was preposterous and a fraud. "I will
go there the next time with you, Mother, and expose the whole
affair."
The next Sunday evening they came, his mother going in
first and he appearing later as a stranger. They took seats on
opposite sides of the seance room.
Soon after the seance began, the boy, Charlie, came and said:
"Hello, Mother dear. Hello, Billy. Do you think that you can
fool the Spirit World? Don't you give Mother credit for
enough common sense to know that this is me?"
The seance progressed, sometimes two voices speaking at
the same time. Usually this does not occur, for politeness in the
true sense is observed most meticulously by those on the Other
Side and I knew there must be a reason for this change that
night, but could not guess what it was.
At the close of the seance, after the light had been put on,
this young man asked everyone to remain seated for a few
moments. "I have an apology to make to Mrs. Cook," he be
gan, "and I want everyone present to hear it. I am a ventrilo
quist and earn my living on the stage by practicing it. Mother
and I came here tonight separately, I believing this was noth
ing but ventriloquism and wishing to expose it to her. I have
found that there is nothing comparable between the two. We
depend on illusion and must be in a large room, preferably an
auditorium, to create it. In a small room we should be detected
easily; neither could we create the illusion in the dark. I am
convinced that what I have heard tonight is not ventriloquism
and make my sincere apology to Mrs. Cook for doubting her."
Few of my critics have had the moral courage to extend an
52 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»»»»»»»»■»»»»»»»»»»
apology to me so publicly, although many have done so in
private.
For some years I had been sitting for a Swedish family. One
of the daughters seemed to enjoy the seances, particularly the
music, as she was a musician herself; but she did not really be
lieve in the Truth. She was quite a skeptic.
One evening I went to their home to hold a seance for them
and a few of their invited friends. In the middle of the seance,
about nine o'clock, a voice spoke to this young woman: "Hello,
Manda, this is Lottie."
Surprised, and with a tinge of satisfaction in her voice, she
replied: "Lottie is not dead."
"No, I am not dead by any means, but I did pass over to
night at six o'clock. I was coming home on a North Clark
Street car and got off at my corner. I passed behind the car and,
not seeing the southbound car coming, stepped right in front
of it. I did not suffer, my body being killed instantly. Believing
in this Truth while on earth, I have come to speak to you to
night." (It will be interesting in this connection to refer to the
chapter on "Early Manifestation.")
No one in the room had heard of this accident until now, but
all were acquainted with the girl. The next morning they
found she had passed over just as she described it in the seance.
The danger of mixing one's forces by going to different
mediums is illustrated in the following two cases. Every per
son cannot be in tune with every medium, and when one is
found through whom your friends in Spirit can come properly,
Tests 53
«■<. < <
it is well to stay with her and not go searching elsewhere. Ev
ery time you go to the same medium, your dear ones become
more accustomed to her vibrations and feel more at home. This
results in much clearer and more satisfactory messages. Those
who go from one medium to another, always unsatisfied, show
they have no real understanding of Spiritual forces or the con
ditions under which they can communicate best with their
loved ones. They defeat their own efforts by their continual
shifting from one medium to another. If they gave their
friends the opportunity to become accustomed to the forces of
one medium, they would receive much more definite and satis
fying messages.
One woman found this out during the absence of a son of
hers on a trip to the West. In company with four other youths
he set out, but before leaving promised to write to her every
week. "If you do not hear from me regularly," were his part
ing words, "it is because something has happened to me and
you must go to Mrs. Cook, because that is where I should greet
you if I should go to the Spirit World."
She received his letters regularly for a while; then they
ceased coming. After three weeks during which she had no
word, she decided to go to a medium, but did not come to me
as her son had told her to do.
She visited a medium near her home one Sunday evening
and evidenced such signs of grief that no one could fail to
notice them. When asked by the medium if she had lost some
dearly loved one, she said: "Yes, I have not heard from my
son for a long time and know that he must be dead."
"I guess he has passed over," said the medium, and
54 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>
proceeded to give her a message purporting to be from him.
After returning home the woman thought the whole thing
over and decided she had best come to me as her son had told
her to do before he left.
One of her daughters who had passed to Spirit came first
and said: "Mamma, you are a fool to believe that Eddie has
passed over. He is not with us and is on his way home now.
You will see him Thursday. The boys became lost on a desert
and after wandering around for days were nearing the end of
their endurance when they were found by a farmer and taken
to a hospital."
The woman said she could hardly believe this in view of the
way she "felt" and what the other medium had told her.
This was more than I could stand. "If, after all the years
you have come to my seances, you cannot believe your own
daughter, you have no faith at all in Spiritualism," I told her.
When her boy returned on Thursday, she became so angy
at the other medium that she took her son there and showed
the woman how wrong her message had been. In considerable
confusion the medium said that an evil spirit must have given
the false message.
Such a thing is impossible—no spirits are evil. (I will say
more about this in the chapter "Obsession and Impersona
tion.") Some may be undeveloped, but they are not allowed
by the higher Forces to give misleading messages. It is absurd
to think that people passing over become worse than they were
while on earth. Those who previously did wrong on earth are
not allowed to do harm when they reach the Other Side. The
fault lay with the improperly developed medium. Had she
Tests 55
<
been a strong one, she would not have been misled by the grief
displayed by the mother. Seeing the woman in tears had more
influence on her than her Guides exercised. This, combined
with the total lack of previous association between her forces
and the woman's, had resulted in the inaccurate message.
A woman who came rather frequently to my seances was
visited by a sister from California whom she interested in Spir
itualism. This sister was afraid of the voices, but wished to
run around to the other mediums. After doing this all one sum
mer she made up her mind to go home in the middle of Sep
tember. Several of the mediums told her not to do this, that
there would be an accident to the train and she would be in
jured. It was necessary for the woman to return to take care of
her business, but she feared to leave in the face of these warn
ings. Her sister told her that she would not believe such mes
sages unless she heard them from my Guides, and came for a
sitting.
Pat told her that she could tell her sister to return to Cali
fornia any time she wished, that nothing would harm her. He
saw that she would get there safely.
Returning home she gave this message to her sister. Asking
that she wire as soon as she arrived home, my friend waited for
the telegram.
In due course it came, saying that something had happened
on the train, and a letter followed. When the letter came it
said: "Your medium's Guides told me I would get home all
right and I did, but if they are so smart, they can tell you what
happened on the train to excite all the passengers so much."
56 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>> >>>■>■» >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> »»■»■»»■>»»
Pat said that a man passed over on the train.
In due course a reply came back telling her to ask my Guides
of what nationality the man was. Pat said that it was a porter
whose weak heart gave out while crossing the mountains, but
that it was of no use giving this woman any more tests because
she would not believe the Truth anyway.
Her journeying around all summer to different mediums
was a poor introduction to Spiritualism in the first place, and
in the second place she probably was incapable of appreciating
what the Spirit World had been able to give her.
The first visit of a middle-aged couple to my seance room
was caused by the passing of a beloved young daughter some
six weeks before. The mother was almost insane with grief,
could not perform her household duties, would not eat, and
was threatening to commit suicide. Being young, I could not
understand such grief, but I pitied the woman and hoped that
she would accept the consolation of which she was in such evi
dent need.
They entered the seance room together with a woman
friend; the light was switched off, and after a few moments
Snowdrop spoke. "That red-headed lady will have to leave
before we can do anything."
I turned on the light again and asked the woman what the
trouble was. In a nervous voice she said: "I was so frightened
when the light went out that I thought I should faint. I guess
that I had better wait in the parlor this time until my friends
are through."
When the seance commenced the second time, the first voice
Tests 57
<
to come was that of a child who spoke rapidly and with con
siderable excitement. "Hello, Mamma and Papa, this is Alice
Ophelia. I am so glad that you came to talk to me. Don't cry
so, Mamma ; it was my time to go and I don't want you to
blame doctor, because he did everything possible for me."
Her mother could not speak for sobs, but her father an
swered her and talked with her for some time. Finally the
mother gained her speech and joined in the conversation. See
ing that she was becoming calmer, the child continued: "When
you get home, I want you to open up my folding blackboard.
Inside it you will find some writing which I did just a few days
before I became sick. If you will ask brother about
it,
he will
tell you, because he was there and watched me."
It
probably
is
unnecessary to say that they found the writing
she described, but
it
is
worth while to make
a
few comments on
the grief-stricken mother's changed attitude. Previous to this
sitting her intense grief had caused many to attempt to console
her. Several relatives came long distances to try to help; two
doctors could do nothing because they found nothing organi
cally wrong with her; ministers and preachers brought
by
earnest and interested friends gave her no assistance. The best
any of them could tell her was that God had taken His child
back to Him, and, in essence, she would have to make the best
of it. Why should God be so selfish as to take her only little girl
whom she loved so devotedly instead of many others who were
not loved
by
their parents, or those who had no parents to
grieve over them? God must be very selfish and
a
cruel God
to make
a
mother who had done no wrong suffer so. This was
her reasoning, and none could answer it. The ministers said
it
58 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>.>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>•
was too bad, but she must find consolation by going to church
and helping others. In this way she would find help, they as
sured her. Some day, they promised her, after she "died," she
would find her little girl in heaven. This is what caused her
desire to commit suicide.
When she came to me, I attempted no consolation. In fact,
I did not know what was causing her grief, but I did know that
if it was because of the "loss" of someone dear to her, as soon
as she realized by talking to this one that God had not taken
him or her away, and that He was a kind God, because He
provided means by which she could speak with her loved one,
she would cease to need consolation. Empty and vague pronv
ises meant nothing to her, but her loved one's voice would
mean everything. It turned out exactly as I knew it would, and
in a short time she ceased her weeping when she found out that
her child was with her at home and was saddened by her tears.
The loneliness left her; she regained her interest in the life
about her and carried on her work as she had done before,
knowing that she could speak with her daughter whenever she
wished.
After a few sittings she asked me if she came too frequently
and would harm her child by "calling her up" too often. Upon
my inquiry she admitted speaking to a minister who, instead
of rejoicing at her new lease on life, attempted to frighten her
by telling her that she was interfering with God's will when
she "called her daughter up from the dead."
I said that we would ask her daughter and our Guides about
this.
The little girl explained to us that our loved ones always are
Tests 59
«.««.<««.«;««« ««««« «««.«««««<
ready to visit with us and are anxious to do so whenever we seek
them with love. "You are not calling me back, Mamma," she
continued, "because I am with you all the time. Whenever you
come to a medium, I am happy to speak to you. I am with you
constantly, but in order to talk with you I must have an instru
ment, a medium. Whenever you feel you wish to communicate
with me, it is right, all you need do is seek a medium."
As our loved ones are living in an environment superior to
ours, we have no power over them ; we cannot "call them up
from the dead." We can attract them to us only through love
and can attract only those who love us.
The mother was glad to receive this explanation and said
that she had been unable to understand how her love could
harm her daughter.
My story of the tests received in the seance room would not
be complete without the account of one I received on the oc
casion of my first visit to a medium. Until four years of age
I spent a great deal of time with my grandparents. Being very
fond of milk, I wished to have a little one day when my grand
mother was busy talking with visitors. After trying in vain for
some time to attract her attention, I finally decided to get the
milk myself. I knew where it was kept—on a shelf in the pan
try considerably beyond my reach —but, nothing daunted, I
laid several articles on top of a chair until I could just reach
the pan. Something went wrong with my structure and down I
went with the pan and milk on my head. In rushed my grand
mother when she heard the crash, to find out what had hap
pened. I was crying and, pointing to my head, sobbed : "Mik,
60 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Nana, mik."
"Yes, I can see that you got your milk all right," she replied
as she picked me up and began to clean away the mess. This
was a good joke on me for a long time.
The first time I visited a medium for a sitting, some time
before I realized I had the gift myself, a voice greeted me and
I said: "That sounds like my grandmother's voice."
"Yes," came the reply, "mik, Nana, mik."

DURING THE WORLD WAR
THE
PERIOD OF THE GREAT WORLD WAR, WHEN SO MANY
thousands of men were having their earthly careers sud
denly and violently terminated, was a time of stress and anx
ious worry for the mothers, wives, and beloved relatives and
friends left at home. Definite and positive word from or about
those on the other side of the ocean was slow in coming, some
times did not arrive for months. Naturally many of the anxious
ones at home turned to the mediums for help, well realizing
no other source of information was so prompt and reliable.
They were not disappointed when they brought the proper
conditions with them to a good medium.
One woman in New York had failed to receive any word
from her son in many weeks. Her last word from him had
come while he still was in a training camp on this side and in
good health, but about to go overseas. Letters she wrote to the
training camp and to the Government brought no definite
word. Nobody seemed able to tell her where her son was or
what had happened to him. Finally some friends induced her
to visit me. Her particular difficulty and the reason for her com
ing to me were explained just before the sitting commenced.
61
62 The Voice Triumphant
>».>».>-> >>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >»».»».>.>.
Invariably I wish to know nothing about strangers coming
to me for the first time, in order that no suggestions of mind-
reading or similar activities may be made. In this case it made
no difference, because she already had tried earthly sources
of information to no avail.
The sitting commenced and the first one to come to her was
her son. He told her that he really had passed over and that
was the reason his letters had ceased coming to her. He was un
able to say why the Government could give her no information,
because he had passed over in a hospital and their records
should be clear. However, as they evidently were not, he gave
her the number of the regiment he belonged to, the name of
the hospital, the ward number, and the date of his passing.
Armed with this information, but not using the last item in
her letter, she wrote to the hospital he named. In due course
she received a reply stating that such a man had passed over in
that ward on a certain date. Everything was exactly as her boy
had told her at her first sitting.
One day during the first week in October 1 9 1 8 two ladies
came to my home in Chicago saying they had heard of me and
wondered whether one of them could be put in touch with her
friends in Spirit. They explained that they were Christian
Scientists; neither had been to a medium before. They knew
nothing about the subject, but one wished to receive word
from her friends. I explained a little about Spiritualism and
the attitude necessary in order to attract one's loved friends
on the Other Side.
Finding that she did not feel easy in the darkness ordinarily
During the World War 63
< < <. < < <. < <. <<
necessary for a direct voice seance, I gave one lady a sitting
through my control Bright Eyes. While controlled, I know
nothing of what is going on or what Bright Eyes says through
me. Suddenly I found myself awake once more in this world,
the woman talking wildly. Slowly I began to understand what
she was saying. It was a tirade against Spiritualism and me
diums, myself in particular. All the way down the stairs into
the living-room she kept it up. Her friend tried to calm her
and apologized to me for her.
Not being able to imagine what could have caused this out
break from a woman who obviously was very refined and well-
bred, I hardly could wait until they had left to return to the
seance room myself and ask my Guides what had occurred. It
appeared that the lady had come to me in order to communi
cate with a very dear friend of hers whom she believed to be in
the Spirit World. Bright Eyes had told her she could not find
this friend there and that he had not passed over as yet. A
young man, however, who described himself as her son did
come and displayed his initials above the lady's head. This
shocked the poor woman terribly. She said that it could not be
her son because she had heard from him in France only a short
time before. Bright Eyes insisted that she had read his initials
correctly and that he also now showed her an aeroplane falling
in flames. It was at this point that the woman became so excited
that it was necessary for my control to leave me. My Guide
Snowdrop then explained that the woman really was a very
lovely character, and only the intensity of the shock of hearing
that her only son had passed over had caused her to speak as
she had. Snowdrop said that she would call me up the next day
64 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■>>>>>>>> >»■»■>» »> > »> »■»■>-»
and apologize and ask me whether she could return, and that
I was to allow her to do so.
Realizing now what had happened, I thanked my Guides
and waited for the morrow with considerable interest. In the
middle of the morning the woman called up and apologized
and told me that she would like to see me, but did not have the
nerve to ask for a sitting after what she had said the day before.
I assured her that I should be glad to see her.
When she arrived, she explained that she had been greatly
shocked the day before ; that it was true her son was an aviator
in France, but that she could not believe he had passed over. I
told her firmly, but as gently as I was able, that my Guides
could not get such a condition around her if it was not there.
They did not claim to be infallible, but when they saw such a
condition, it must be there. I said that the best thing to do was
to go back to the seance room and see if they could give us any
details that would remove the doubt.
We did so, and my Guides described to her just how the
boy's plane had been shot down by three German planes. She
wept sorely, but finally became calm enough to greet her boy
when he spoke to her. He consoled her as well as he could and
told her to write to the other side and try to get some informa
tion, although he doubted that she would receive anything
definite for a time because of the great confusion there.
After sending a number of letters and obtaining no definite
information, she was told by the Red Cross at the end of three
months that a boy answering the description of her son had
been shot down about the time she mentioned. It was not un
til six months had passed that the Government sent her the
During the World War 65
■<■ < «■<■ < < «■<■ < «■<■ < <
official notification and she was able to find out the details that
corroborated the boy's account to her at her second sitting.
During all this time she had been coming regularly to talk
with her son. At one of her visits he told her he had taken out
ten thousand dollars' worth of insurance, and that she would
get it after the official notification. She told her son frankly
that she thought he was fooling her, because she knew he al
ways had been very careless about money matters. His family
was wealthy and he never had paid any attention to the value
of money. It would be entirely contrary to his nature to think
of such a thing as insurance.
He assured her that he was in earnest and that she would get
the money.
She did, and very welcome it was too when it came, because
during the interim trouble she had with her family had cut off
the major portion of her income.
She did not get along very well with her daughter, but her
son told her to be as good to his sister as possible because she
was not destined to remain long in this world, and his mother
would grieve if she was not as good to her daughter as her
daughter would allow her to be. This also proved to be correct,
the daughter passing to the Spirit World a year or two later.
This woman I now consider one of my very good friends, al
though at our first meeting neither of us thought very much
of the other, I must confess.
It would seem that the help given by the Spirit Forces to
individuals in trouble could be extended to groups and given
to avoid trouble as well as to correct it. In a few cases this
66 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>
help really was made use of and thousands of lives were saved,
but much more could have been accomplished if those in au
thority had believed in and consulted their friends in Spirit.
A few of my efforts to render this sort of help bore fruit
only because of the assistance of a man who recently had begun
coming to my seances rather frequently. I knew nothing about
him personally, but obeyed my Forces when I was told to
convey a warning to him.
One night I was awakened from a sound sleep by a touch
on my arm. I noticed by a clock near my bed that it was about
two o'clock in the morning, but a glance round the room re
vealed no one who might have touched me and, after deciding
that it must have been my imagination, I was preparing to go
to sleep again when my arm was touched a second time. Look
ing up quickly, I saw a large, fine-looking man dressed in the
uniform of our soldiers standing beside the bed. He now began
to speak to me, when he found he had gained my attention, and
told me that a troop-ship loaded to capacity with our boys was
scheduled to leave for France on a certain day. As he began
to speak, I was shown a vision of the loaded ship. The enemy
had obtained the sailing date and were making preparations
to torpedo it and he was afraid that all would be lost if the Gov
ernment was not warned. He explained that many in Spirit
were watching out for our boys and doing their best to help
them. He asked me to call up a certain man, naming him, the
first thing in the morning and give him this message. I could
not understand why I should give such a warning to a compara
tive stranger, but this soldier made me promise to do so.
When morning came, I began to wonder if the whole thing
During the World War 67
<
had been a dream or if it all was true. Debating with myself
whether to make the call or not, I again heard this soldier's
voice in my ear and realized that I had had no dream. With
hesitancy I called the man up and told him that I did not know
whether he would think me crazy or not, but that I had to give
him a rather startling message from a soldier in Spirit.
He told me to go ahead or, if I wished, to come down to his
office right away.
Explaining that it was best to see him personally, I set out.
I told him my story and said that I hoped he would not
think me crazy.
He smiled and sent a telegram to Washington immediately.
Later he showed me a reply saying: "Thanks" and told me
the ship's sailing had been postponed several days, during
which time it was found out that all arrangements had been
made to torpedo it and that the enemy undoubtedly would
have been successful had not my warning caused the boat to be
held up.
During the following weeks similar warnings came to me
twice. Finally I said: "Why is
it,
Doctor, that whenever
I
get
a
warning of this nature
I
am told to give
it
to you?"
"Oh, that
is
all right," he laughed, "they know that
I
have
good connections."
Supposing he merely was some citizen with friends
in
Wash
ington who would listen to him,
I
thought little more about
the reason why
I
must give the messages to him until one day
he came to me and said: "Well, Medie,
it
is
my turn to go to
France this time. In confidence, before
I
go,
I
will tell you why
you were directed to give the warnings to me.
I
am
a
member
68 The Voice Triumphant

of the Secret Service and it has been a most wonderful experi
ence for me to be able to work for my country in this way. I am
sorry that all the others cannot or do not understand how to
avail themselves of such help."
I know that many people have claimed to have predicted the
end of the war. Some may have done so, many were not correct.
Not wishing to tire my readers with a subject they may have
read sufficiently about, I nevertheless should like to mention
briefly the circumstances under which it was done in my seance
room, because of the test it gave to a very skeptical lawyer who
was present, among many other persons. This man was a good
friend of mine and had handled very brilliantly some cases
for friends of the Center. He had not disdained to avail him
self of the advice and help of those on the Other Side while
conducting these cases; nevertheless he disclaimed belief in
the Truth and often rallied me about my "Spirits," as he called
them. He seemed to like to attend my seances, however, and
came often. He made no attempt to disguise his skepticism and
was inclined to joke with my Guides.
One evening during the month of May 1918, while he was
present in a large public seance, apparently in a spirit of fun he
said: "Pat, you know everything. When will the war end?"
Pat said: "On next November eleventh there will be peace."
Everyone present thought Pat had taken a hand at banter
ing friend lawyer and considered it a good joke. I did myself
and forgot about the matter. It happened, however, that Pat
knew the man was serious when he asked the question, intend
ing to make a test of the reply, and therefore gave him a seri>
During the World War 69
<
ous answer. The day we received word of the signing of the
Armistice, this lawyer called me up and reminded me of what
Pat had told him some six months before. This man no longer
claims to be a skeptic.

UNITE
Oh, you who turn rebellious eyes on fate,
Think not to find the remedy in hate.
War, the red monster, owes to hate her birth;
She is the Mother of all ills on earth;
She is the foe to progress and to peace.
Oh, not through hate shall rank oppression cease;
Not by the bludgeon, bullet, or the knife;
Not by the holocaust of human life;
Not by destruction shall the change be wrought,
But by construction and united thought.
For love of justice and for love of right,
For love of country and of home, unite!
Let go the bones of discord and dispute ;
Sink small ambitions, and let self be mute;
Unite on precepts beautiful and broad.
Forget your dogmas, but remember God;
Be calm, in calmness lies enduring strength;
Be patient, patience brings reward at length;
Be firm in great things, quick to yield in small;
Ignore self-interests for the good of all.

LIKE ATTRACTS LIKE
THE
LAW OF ATTRACTION IS IN OPERATION THROUGHOUT
the universe and we see its manifestations about us all the
time. Mere mention of the facts that a mocking-bird seeks as
its mate another mocking-bird, that a man seeks a woman, that
a man of science seeks one interested in his field, that a woman
lavishes love on her child and often is not greatly interested
in her friend's, will call to mind many other examples.
The effects of this law are particularly evident in the seance
room, but it is often forgotten by new-comers who fear that
"strange spirits" will come and try to fool them. Such a thing
the Law of Attraction prevents absolutely. On the Other Side
life is led in strict concord with all phases of Natural Law, and
one soul attracts another soul only through love and common
interests. It is possible on earth for a person to attract another
whom he may dislike, but this is because they have earthly in
terests in common or the one seeks advantages from the other.
When, however, one or both parties are on the Other Side,
such a thing cannot happen, God's laws being understood and
adhered to strictly there.
Very slight acquaintance with the seance room will show
what little interest a Spirit friend has in anyone except his own
73
74 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>
friends, those to whom he is attracted. He will greet others
politely, but evidences no concern at all about their affairs.
This (may I call it indifference?) is noticeable particularly
in the Indian Guides. One will come and say: "Hello, chief."
Before his loved one answers, some other person unacquainted
with his voice may greet him, asking if he is so-and-so, their
Guide.
His total lack of interest in the person making the mistake
shows most clearly in his voice as he makes emphatic denial:
"No, no, I come to Chief Smith."
One long in Spirit may be asked, by a mortal friend of the
person to whom the spirit is attracted, some simple personal
question. Invariably the answer is: "I do not know anything
about that, but I will either find out from your Guides or have
them speak to you."
This Law of Attraction controls so strictly those communi
cating with each other on each side of the veil that a very short
acquaintance with the seance room removes the last vestige of
the fear that one may attract any except one's own friends.
I do not believe that many cases are needed to illustrate this,
and will confine myself to one aspect only, that of the language
used.
Frequently new-comers to the seance room express surprise
that a friend in Spirit can use a language different from that
which the medium speaks. In a direct voice seance the language
used by the medium has nothing to do with that used by the
Spirit visitor. There is no more interdependence between the
two than there is between a telephone circuit and the language
Like Attracts Like 75
<
used by the two speakers at each end. Any tongue may be
spoken over the telephone and transmitted properly. In a simi
lar manner any tongue may be conveyed by the medium's
forces, whether she as a human being understands it or not.
Personally I speak English only, but in my seance room most
of the languages of the earth have been used at one time or
another by the Spirit friends. Once in a great while a language
will be used which is understood by no human being in the
room.
This occurred one evening at a public seance. A particular
Spirit would speak and then tap a certain lady present with the
trumpet. None of us could understand him, but we asked him
if he was speaking to the lady whom he was tapping, he would
signal: "Yes."
Finally Snowdrop spoke up and said: "Lady, you seem to
live over a Chinese restaurant and, whether because of that
or for some other reason, a Chinese spirit has been attracted to
you. He is a very highly developed soul and has come to you as
a Guide, but as yet has not learned to speak English. He tells
me that until now he has not had need of this language."
The woman was very anxious to know what her Guide had
to say to her and at the close of the seance asked me if I would
permit her to bring a Chinaman with her next time to translate
the message.
I told her I certainly would if the poor man would not be
frightened to death.
A few days later she appeared with a Chinaman and we
entered the seance room. The same voice came again, but this
time what it had to say was understood. After conversing for
y6 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»>»»».».>»
a few moments, the Chinaman addressed us and told us that
the Spirit wished him to tell us that he had been on the Other
Side for many years, but never had been attracted to anyone in
this country before and consequently had not learned English.
He told us that when on this earth he had been of the Chinese
nobility. He said, through our Chinese companion, that this
sort of conversation was very unsatisfactory and that he would
study English in order to be able to speak to us directly. This
he did, but never completely overcame his accent.
He proved a wonderful Guide to the woman in many ways,
forewarning her of various events and saving her much trouble.
On one occasion he told her that the restaurant above which
she was living was going to have trouble with the police, and
to avoid any embarrassment to herself she had best move. She
did so and found out that the place was raided the day he said
it would be. Another time he told her that she soon would meet
a large, blond man who would fall in love with her. She met
this man soon afterwards and married him.
One day a man came to my home in New York and said to
me: "Mrs. Cook, I have been a believer in your Truth for
twenty years and have had many wonderful experiences all
over the world, but there are two things which I never have
had and for which I long. Can you give them to me?"
I told him that he probably was demanding too much, and
that was why his desire was not granted.
"I do not think that I am," he said, "and from what I have
heard of you I believe that you can give me what my heart
has been yearning for during twenty years."
Like Attracts Like 77
<.
I told him that I did not know whether I could or not, that
his results depended greatly on himself.
He came to a large seance and was the second among forty
people to receive a message. His mother came and called him
Altwald.
He was much excited and cried: "Mother, this is more than
wonderful ; this is what I have been wanting you to come and
say all these years, but you never have."
Then she began to speak to him in Danish, his native tongue.
This was his second wish, and the joy of it broke him up
completely. "How I have longed for these two things all these
years! But I never have mentioned them to anyone. At last
they have been granted me."
He had come in love; his mother could grant him his wish.
Several times Indians have come to my seance room, and
the whole conversation from start to finish has taken place in
their tribal dialect. Invariably they bring good conditions, most
of them being born Spiritualists, their life in intimate contact
with Nature teaching them God's laws better than any uni
versity now teaches them.
On one occasion a fine-appearing Indian came to my door.
"Mrs. Cook, I have heard much about you. I am a Carlisle
graduate, what you would call an educated Indian. As you
know, we are Spiritualists, hearing and seeing the Great Spirit
in the sun, the stars, the clouds, and all nature. We are in the
habit of consulting our loved ones who have passed over. I
come to you now as to an open door to the Great Beyond, know
ing that if I come with love in my heart, no barrier will be
78 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >■»■»■»■»■»■»»» >■»■»■»
placed between my loved ones and me. You are more than a
means of transmitting their messages ; you open wide the way
and I know then that my loved ones can speak to me in my
own language. My tribe knowing this also, I have come all the
way from Oklahoma just for this one talk. I wish to find out
much valuable information that I can carry back with happi
ness to my tribe. It is wonderful not to be so 'civilized' that one
denies the truth of the bond of love uniting us with those who
have gone before."
He received in his own language all that he came for. Can
I add anything to this philosophy of approach to the seance
room? Anyone approaching his loved ones with the same at
titude could not fail to have beautiful results (always provid
ing, of course, that the medium is highly developed).
During the early reconstruction days following the World
War, a commission from one of the Balkan states came to
America on an official visit, the principal purpose of which, I
believe, was finance. After completing their work in Washing
ton and New York, the members of the commission came to
Chicago and by appointment had a sitting with me. These
gentlemen, all of the very highest rank, had a long seance,
with no voices in English except those of my Guides. At the
conclusion of the seance I knew exactly nothing of anything
said.
"You will pardon us," said the spokesman of the commis
sion, "but we had to seek advice on grave national issues. That
advice has come to us from some of the most astute statesmen
our country ever had. We also have been privileged to greet
Like Attracts Like 79
<
our dear ones. All has been most satisfactory and quite in keep
ing with our conception of your mediumship. I might add that
most of us previously never had heard the direct voices."
Languages such as the Swedish, German, Norwegian, Ital
ian, and others are spoken commonly in the seance room.
Occasionally there comes to my seance room a Spirit who gives
a lecture in a deep, sonorous, and most pleasing voice, but in a
language no one yet in the seance room understands. He comes
only when many persons are present and speaks for at least
five minutes. Even without understanding what he says, it is
a great pleasure to listen to his voice. Even my Guides will not
tell me who he is or what he says, other than that he is a very
advanced Soul and is giving us a beautiful lecture on some
aspect of Natural Law. In all my years of mediumship this is
the only Spirit friend who has visited my seance room and
never identified himself.
These few instances show how people attract their own
loved ones or those interested in their earthly activities and
that the language used generally is the one they are most
familiar with and makes no difference in the communication.

DETECTION
CONSIDERING
THE WONDERFUL GUIDANCE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR
our friends in Spirit to give to any of us who will accept
it,
and the fact that some of them always are with every one of
us and know everything we do, they would seem to be the
means par excellence for exposing crime and bringing to jus
tice the perpetrators. They are actual witnesses of the act and
unimpeachable deponents. No matter how secret the deed or
how well the wrongdoer thinks he has covered his tracks, many
of those
in
Spirit have accompanied him every step and wit
nessed every action. In the case of major crimes my Guides
frequently tell me who the real perpetrator
is
and what
prompted him.
It
often happens, most unfortunately, that
some innocent person
is
accused and has to stand the indignities
and injustice of jail and
a
trial, even though he ultimately may
be acquitted. Also, some of the most wanton crimes go un
solved, or at least the guilty one
is
not punished
by
the au
thorities.
The failure both of our laws and of their execution
is
de
plorable, but what injustice
is
done
in
this world
is
corrected in
the next. Where those deserving
it
have escaped punishment
here, they must make restitution there, and the longer this has
81
82 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
been delayed, the more difficult it is for them. Their "punish
ment" consists, not in bodily inflicted injury, such as incarcera
tion, for example, but in their failure to progress spiritually
and attain to the rank and company they wish to until they have
made restitution. In their clearer understanding they realize
what wrong they have done, and suffer until they can right it.
They perceive the glorious life about them and the beautiful
work accomplished by others, but can have no part in either
until the canker they have inflicted on their own soul has been
removed by atonement. Their misdeeds on earth have injured
no one spiritually but themselves ; however, their victims or
the victims' families may have been hurt in a temporal way,
and it is this injury they must correct before their own soul's
wound can heal.
While it would often be best for all concerned, the evil-doer,
the victim, and any easily influenced spectators, for the crime
to be punished promptly and justly, earthly laws do not admit
or permit the only infallible agency which is available to hu
man beings to bring this about. What our friends in Spirit can
accomplish when allowed, I will show in certain cases which
have come before me. These concern minor crimes only, such
as robbery, but what was done could just as well be duplicated
in major crimes.
For some time I had been sitting for a widow who first
came to me when her husband passed over. This woman had
married young, had lived with her husband many years, and
had been protected from most of life's vicissitudes by him.
Not being very assertive, she had leaned greatly on him and
Detection 83
<
consequently at his passing was quite helpless and did not
know just how to "carry on." After becoming acquainted with
her, I felt a great sympathy for her helplessness and did my
best to extend to her, with the help of my Guides and hers,
the guiding hand she needed so sorely. After her husband's
passing she gave up the big house that had been theirs, dis
missed all the servants except her personal maid, and went to
live in a hotel. Because of a slight deafness she received her
messages through my control Bright Eyes, and from the be
ginning was warned by Bright Eyes to be very careful whom
she employed as maid and to require good references.
Being such a trusting person and unused to the selfishness
and hypocrisy so often present in human beings, when her
maid left, she forgot to heed Bright Eyes's caution. A very
pretty young girl of about seventeen came to I'er and asked for
employment, saying she had no home, no money, and so forth.
Taking pity on her and heedless of the lack of references, she
employed the girl and was well pleased with her brightness
and attentiveness.
One day she called me up, so agitated she hardly could
speak. "Medie, I am in so much trouble, I must have a message
from Bright Eyes right away."
I asked her what the trouble was and she said: "Oh, Medie,
I have lost something that is so dear to me and I can't un
derstand it. I have lived in this hotel for such a long time and
nothing like this has ever happened before. I have lost my
little Swiss watch, the one my husband gave me. You know it
was a curiosity, for it would strike, but I valued it most be
cause he gave it to me. Please, Medie, can you help me? I am
84 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
heartbroken about it."
I told her to come right over and I would see what the
Guides could do to help her.
As usual, she came with a companion, this time the new
maid she had employed. She explained to me that for some
time she had missed things, such as stockings, but did not care
much about them. Her watch was something entirely differ
ent; that she cared a great deal about. The girl was anxious
to sit with her mistress, but seemed rather nervous, and when
she told me she never had been in a seance before, I told her
that I was afraid she would bring a very hard condition and had
best stay out. But no, she wanted to come in.
As soon as we were in the room, Bright Eyes took control
of me and said: "You have the little thief there beside you.
She has taken silk stockings and other little things from you.
She has taken a pearl necklace which you have not missed yet,
in addition to the watch."
The girl denied this hotly, but instead of arguing with her,
Bright Eyes got up, pulled open her dress at the bosom, and
showed the watch concealed in a clever little pocket.
The girl then confessed and when they reached home, re
turned the things she had taken, including the pearl necklace.
How different this method of solving such a puzzle is from
the one which would be used by the detective force! Bright
Eyes knew the thief and proved her knowledge by taking the
watch from the place where it was concealed. No lengthy "in
vestigation," no third-degree questioning of several persons,
some of whom would of necessity be innocent, no bodily search,
no court trial with lawyers arguing pro and con and the judge
Detection 85
<
attempting to decide which was right or which knew the law
the best. The girl got nothing for her wrongdoing and was
punished promptly by losing a good home and position.
Another case was solved just as effectively by Bright Eyes,
but entailed considerable embarrassment for me because of the
dense ignorance of the woman we were helping. She had at
tended a few seances at intervals, enough for me to know her by
sight. One evening she appeared at a large public seance look
ing rather upset.
When Bright Eyes came in, she said: "What is the matter
with you, lady? You look as though you had lost your best
friend, or something like that."
"Yes, I have lost something," she replied.
"I know what it is," Bright Eyes continued; "it is something
you value very highly, but I cannot tell you any more about
it now. There are too many people present."
"I will come first thing in the morning, then," volunteered
the woman.
"If you care to come to a private seance tomorrow morning,
bring with you the box in which you kept what you have lost
and I will try to help you."
When the woman appeared the next day, Bright Eyes again
took control of me and told her that she had lost two diamonds,
"and you are very careless with your valuables," Bright Eyes
continued. "It is a wonder you have not lost some before."
The woman admitted this.
"The one who took your two rings is the woman who lives
across the hall from you. Her husband does not do very well
86 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
and she is envious of you. When you get home, this woman
is going to come to you and tell you that her husband is giving
her a pair of diamond ear-rings for her birthday. The dia
monds in them, of course, would be the ones you have lost.
Now, we do not want our medium to have any trouble. The
thing for you to do is to apply for a search warrant and go into
her apartment. You will find the rings."
The woman returned home, and shortly in came her neigh
bor from across the hall.
"I have some wonderful news," she said excitedly. "My
husband is giving me a pair of diamond ear-rings for my birth
day."
Instead of keeping her own counsel and doing as Bright
Eyes told her to, the woman blurted out : "Sure and I know
it. I have been to a fortune-teller, and your ear-rings are going
to be made from the diamonds you took from me."
Her neighbor pretended great anger, and after arguing
hotly for some time they went to a police station and brought a
policeman up to my home. He asked me if I had seen these
women before, and I told him I knew one of them, but not the
other. He then asked if I had accused the strange woman of
being a thief.
I told him that I had not, but the woman I knew had told
me what my control had said.
Like all people ignorant of Spiritualism, the policeman ridi
culed the idea of my being controlled.
Keeping my temper, I told him that no Guide of mine
would make such a statement if it was not true.
I received a little support by the woman's chiming in with:
Detection 87
<.
"I know it is so, because she described the rings this woman
has and they were mine."
After some further arguing I turned to the woman and
said: "If my Guide told you this woman has the rings, she must
have told you where they were hidden."
"Oh, yes, she did. I forgot that. She said they were in a
chamois bag in the bottom of a trunk."
Turning to the policeman, I said : "Then we should have no
trouble locating them, and if this woman is innocent, she can
not object to our looking in that one place."
This was fair and reasonable enough, and finally the woman
consented, after again stating her innocence.
We went to her home and found the rings where Bright
Eyes had said they were.
In giving her consent she had hoped to be able to remove the
rings to another place without our seeing her do
it,
but we
gave her no opportunity.
To give the policeman his due, his whole attitude changed.
He became most enthusiastic and wanted to have the case
written up
in
the newspapers. Then he wanted to get me
a
"job as
a
private detective," saying that while he did not un
derstand how
I
knew these things,
it
did not matter and he
guaranteed
I
would have all the business
I
could handle. For
various obvious reasons such
a
calling did not appeal to me.
Undoubtedly my Guides could do much good through me and
obtain justice in many cases where
it
was needed
if
I
had such
a
position
;
but
I
believed, and still believe, that
I
can do more
good in the world
by
making my gift and the teachings ob
tained
by
means of
it
available to as large
a
part of the public
88 The Voice Triumphant
■>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■>>>>>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»
as I am physically able, and this I should be unable to do if
hampered by detective work and the necessary secrecy in
evitably connected with
it.
Incidentally Bright Eyes received no reward from the
woman.
The thief was punished
by
obtaining no benefit of any sort
for the disgrace the exposure of her act brought her. She nat
urally was very bitter at the time toward me, but some time,
if
not on earth, then in Spirit, she will realize that the prompt
revelation of her wrongdoing was the best thing that could
have happened. When that time comes, she will be grateful
to me. The longer payment for any deed
is
delayed, the greater
will
it
be, and
I
saved her from the heavy restitution which
would have been hers had she not been exposed so quickly.
The following case involved no crime, but shows the ability
of the Spirit World to solve promptly mysteries that are
baffling the regular authorities.
One evening
a
strange man appeared at
a
public seance.
I
took no particular notice of him, as several strangers always
were present at these public gatherings. We assembled in the
seance room, the light was turned out, and the opening hymn
was sung. As
it
was ending,
I
saw Pat build up and felt him
brush
by
me as he stepped behind my chair. Turning,
I
saw
he had stopped in front of
a
man sitting behind me.
"Hello, Jack," he greeted the man. "You are
a
policeman,
and before we go any further,
I
want to know whether you
have come here tonight to make trouble or whether you have
come with
a
sincere desire to communicate with your friends on
Detection 89
<
my side of life."
"Why," stammered the man, "why—"
"I do not think you have come to cause any difficulties and
I believe I know why you are here," continued Pat.
The man had not recovered from his astonishment, but he
assured Pat he had come because he was in trouble and had
been told that Mrs. Cook might be able to help him. He ad
mitted he was a policeman.
"Well," said Pat, "what is it you wish us to do for you that
you cannot do for yourself?"
"My daughter has disappeared and we cannot locate her
anywhere. I don't know whether she left home of her own
accord, has married, or has met with foul play. She is severe
teen years old and always seemed happy and I cannot imagine
why she should leave in such a manner."
"You will have to wait a short time while I look into this,"
said Pat, "although I should think you would be able to find
her if anyone could."
"Well, I have not been able to do it and I have come to ask
you for help if you can give it to me."
In a short time Pat came back.
"I think I know something about your daughter now. You
appear to have been married twice and your wife at home is
not the mother of your daughter. Is not that right?"
"Yes, my first wife passed over and I finally married again,
after my children had grown up ; but what has this to do with
my daughter's disappearance?"
"Just this," said Pat; "your daughter and her stepmother
did not get along together at all and your daughter finally
90 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>»»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»
grew tired of all the bickering and has run away."
"Why, I did not know they had any trouble. Of course
I knew that once in a while they would have an argument, but
it never sounded serious to me. If you can tell me where she is
and how to get her back, I will try to see they get along better
in the future."
"I can tell you where she
is,
but you could not locate her
even then, because she has adopted an assumed name. She
is
in
Dallas, Texas, and
is
using the name of —.
I
guess you know
how to get her back with this information, but try to make
it
happier for her at home. She
is
headstrong and somewhat hard
to get along with,
I
can see, but she is
a
good girl and will try
to do her part."
The man thanked Pat gratefully and on his way home sent
a
telegram to the chief of police at Dallas asking him to return
his daughter.
He got her back all right, and soon after, she married and
began
a
home of her own.
The surprise of this man at Pat's greeting and intimate
knowledge of himself was no greater than that of
a
man who
made an appointment for
a
sitting at two o'clock one day.
I
never had seen him.
Finding
I
had some time to spare before the appointment,
I
went for
a
walk in Lincoln Park.
As
I
was strolling along,
I
heard Pat say to me: "Medie,
it
is
about one thirty now, but the man
is
at the house already. You
had best go back right away. He
is
in
ordinary clothes, but
I
find he
is
an Irish sergeant of police.
I
think he sincerely wants
Detection 91
a sitting, but speak to him before going up to the seance room
and tell him he is a policeman and ask him if he has come to
make trouble or to receive a message from his loved ones."
I hurried home and found the man sitting in the living-
room. After introducing myself I said: "Mister, I have never
seen you before and do not know your name, but a Guide of
mine just told me as I was walking in the park that you were
here already and that you are a police sergeant. Now, is that
true?"
"Why, yes, it
is,
but
I
do not understand how you know it,"
he replied in astonishment.
"My Guide also told me to ask you whether you have come
to make any trouble for me or whether you are seeking to
learn about the beauties of the Other Life. In either event
I
am to assure you that we can accommodate you."
He laughed. "Say, what kind of
a
man
is
this Guide of
yours, anyway?"
"He
is
an Irishman like yourself and will introduce himself
to you
if
you go into the seance room."
He became serious. "Really, Mrs. Cook,
I
have come here
to communicate with my friends,
if
such
a
thing
is
possible.
I
know nothing about this, but have many dear friends to whom
I
should like to talk
if
I
can."
He was greeted
by
his mother, who sang an unusual Irish
song. He was overjoyed, saying this had been her favorite song
while on earth. He had
a
very beautiful sitting and was ex
tremely happy to find his friends could communicate with
him.
At the close of the seance he said he knew beyond any
92 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >»»>
question that his mother and friends had spoken to him, but
"How can I square myself with my church?" was his plaintive
question.
I could not help him with that, but he must have found a
way, because he came back often and soon began to ask for
help about his police problems. He received it every time and
was another who wished me to take up detective work to help
obtain justice. As I have explained before, I did not feel it
was my real work and had to refuse. I believe these few cases
will give an idea of what can be done by the Spirit World in
securing justice, when it is given the opportunity.
Here, I should like to say that in spite of all the persecu
tion I have undergone at the hands of the authorities in differ
ent cities, I have found most members of the police forces with
whom I have come in contact to be fine men, strongly imbued
with the idea of their duty. When they have become acquainted
with me and gained some understanding of my work, they
have been kind to me. Most of them never thoroughly under
stood me or had any belief in my religion, but they respected
my sincerity and the power they saw I possessed.

PINK ROSE
PINK
ROSE IS A CONTROL OF MINE WHO PERFORMS MARRIAGES,
conducts christenings and funerals, and lectures and gives
tests to individuals in large audiences. She will very seldom
come to one or two people in a seance, as Bright Eyes does;
she prefers to deal with large groups and does her work in the
light.
Several times I have held open meetings in Carnegie Hall
in New York City, giving the opportunity to Pink Rose to do
the work she loves. She delivered beautiful" lectures each time
and at the conclusion gave messages to strangers in the audi
ence. Most of the hundreds of people present were strangers,
and many were skeptics having no knowledge of Spiritualism.
Conditions thus were extremely hard, but Pink Rose enjoys
overcoming this very difficulty and proving to many at one
time the knowledge and power of those on the Other Side.
Singling out a woman at one meeting she said : "Lady, you
never have been to anything like this before and do not under
stand it. I wish to give you a message, however, and am sure
you will appreciate it. You have a beautiful son, by the name
of Harry, on our side of life. Today is his birthday and he
would be twenty-four years old if still with you."
93
94 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>-V
"Why, that is right," exclaimed the woman, "he was young
when he passed and I had forgotten him."
"Yes," said Pink Rose, "he was only six years old, but he
never has forgotten his birthday or his mother, and helps you
all the time."
Among the many present at another meeting was an Irish
woman who happened to be passing Carnegie Hall and, seeing
the crowd of people, stepped in out of curiosity to find out what
was going on. Unknown to her, a brother had done the same
thing and was seated on the opposite side of the hall.
After delivering her lecture Pink Rose began giving mes
sages. Finally she pointed to this woman and said: "Lady, your
name is Mary and you never have been in a place like this be
fore. Your mother is with us. This is Saturday and your mother
has been here since last Sunday, just one week. She is very
happy and finds everything more glorious than she imagined
it could be. She loved God and the reward of Spirit beauty is
hers."
The woman wept a little and said everything was true.
Pointing then to a man on the opposite side of the room,
Pink Rose said to him: "Your name is Jim and you are the
brother of the lady to whom I gave this message."
Brother and sister, standing up, recognized each other with
surprise, neither having any intimation that the other was pres
ent, although the man had been startled at the message he
heard Pink Rose giving.
Pink Rose continued: "Your mother wishes me to say that
she guided both of you here. She says also that she now is with
Pink Rose 95
<■ < < < < < < < < < << < < < < < <
Henrietta and met her first when she passed over."
It seems that just before this mother passed, she opened
her eyes and, gazing intently, seemed to see someone invisible
to the others about the bed, and said: "Henrietta," the name
of a girlhood chum who had preceded her to the Spirit World.
Now the brother and sister realized what had happened.
I have said that Pink Rose very seldom comes to a single
person, but once in a while she will do so.
One woman, for whom I had been sitting for some time,
came one day in a very nervous state. She was worried about
her husband's losing his position.
"Medie," she said, "I have heard you say many times how
wonderful Pink Rose is. Do you think she would talk to me?
I am in great need of a message which I am sure she could
give me."
"The only way I know in which you might get her," I said,
"is to have a trance reading through Bright Eyes and ask her
if it is possible for you to speak with Pink Rose."
When Bright Eyes took control of me and greeted the
woman, she said: "You do not want to talk to me today; you
want Pink Rose. I will ask her to come to you."
Pink Rose came and gave the woman a beautiful sitting.
She said that the woman's husband would not lose his posi
tion, that the company was reorganizing and would give him
a much higher one than he then held.
"I do not want you to think this is fortune-telling, and if I
thought you would, I would not give you this message," con
tinued Pink Rose.
96 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>.>>>.>■>>>>>>.> >>>.»».»»» > > >
The woman earnestly assured her that she needed the mes
sage and would not consider it fortune-telling.
Pink Rose then gave her a detailed prophecy for five years
ahead, because she saw the woman was much worried and
would use the information properly. Everything eventually
proved absolutely accurate.
At the close of the sitting Pink Rose said: "You have a
schoolgirl friend whom you have not spoken to for two years.
That gives you no blessing and hinders your development.
Today she needs you badly and I want you to go directly to
her home from here, not to your own home first."
The next day the woman came back and told me that she
arrived at her friend's home to find her little daughter sinking
with diphtheria. She passed over that night, and the comfort
this woman was able to give the child's mother was her partial
payment for the comfort the Spirit World brought her through
Pink Rose.

AUTUMN
Sweet is the voice that calls
From babbling waterfalls,
In meadows where the downy seeds are flying.
And soft the breezes blow
And eddying come and go
In faded gardens where the rose is dying.
Amid the stubbled corn
The little quail pipes at morn,
The merry partridge drums in hidden places
And glittering insects gleam
Above the reedy stream,
Where busy spiders spin their filmy laces.
At eve cool shadows fall
Across the garden wall
And on the clustered grapes to purple turning;
And pearly vapors lie
Along the eastern sky
Where the broad harvest moon is redly burning.
Ah, soon on field and hill
The wind shall whistle chill,
And patriarch swallows call their flocks together

PREDICTION OF FUTURE EVENTS
IN
DISCUSSING THE PREDICTION OF FUTURE EVENTS BY THOSE
in Spirit it is well to distinguish between warnings of per
sonal danger and foretelling of future occurrences of national
or world-wide importance. The latter is very seldom done,
because of the general attitude toward what the public calls
fortune-telling. The Spirit World has given ample evidence
that it knows and can tell mortals definitely of events which
still are to come to pass, but it seldom exercises this power,
because it has found out that human beings as a whole do not
believe in the accuracy of its prophecies and do not profit by
them. There
is,
consequently, no reason why they should im
part this knowledge to us.
Before discussing this further,
I
should like to show how
our Guides can and do quite often give us warnings for our
physical safety. (The case, mentioned later, of the minister's
little daughter who was burned to death will come to mind in
this connection.)
At one time

sat frequently for
a
young woman, the only
child of quite well-to-do people, who was well loved and some
what pampered
by
them. They scoffed at her belief in Spir

but she had always dearly loved her grandfather and

when she found out she could speak to him even though he was
in the Spirit World, she came often to do so.
One day he told her that very shortly a young couple with
whom she was friendly would call on her and invite her to
accompany them on a trip to Detroit. They had just purchased
a new, rather expensive car (whose make he told her) and
wanted to break it in on this trip. She was not to go with them
by any means. Her Guides saw that a short distance this side
of Detroit they would have a terrible accident, and if she was
along, she would be severely injured.
That same evening this couple called on her and told her of
the trip they were planning. She said she knew all about
it,
that they had just purchased
a
S
— car, and that they wanted
her to go with them. They were astonished at her knowledge,
telling her the car had just been bought that day and had not
been delivered, and said they had intended to ask her to go
with them. She said she must refuse, because they were going
to have an accident near Detroit and she did not wish to be
along. They urged her to come, calling her "queer" to refuse
for such
a
notion. You see, the accuracy of her knowledge about
what had already taken place did not impress them sufficiently
to make them think that possibly the rest of her knowledge
was just as accurate. Upon her definite refusal they invited
another couple to go with them. The trip was uneventful until,
a
few miles from Detroit, the driver turned out to pass
a
moving-van. Another car was coming toward them, and
al
though
it
did not hit them, their car got out of control, ran off
the road, and turned over twice. When everything was over,
two had passed to the Spirit World, and the other two were in
Prediction of Future Events 101
.<
a hospital for many weeks.
Even after this wonderful demonstration of the power the
Spirit World has for protecting mortals, this girl's parents re
fused even to investigate the Truth. They knew her life had
been saved by the warning, because she had told them of it be
fore the trip started, saying that was why she had refused to go
along. It has become very evident to me from my years of
work that mortals must be born on a sufficiently high plane to
understand Spiritualism. There appears to be no possible way
of convincing others of its truth. They may be smart as we
judge smartness in this world, but their souls are not developed
sufficiently to understand or appreciate this Truth.
A warning very similar to this was given to a man by one of
my Guides, but was unheeded. Let us see with what result.
Many years ago, at the beginning of my work, several execu
tives of a well-known Chicago company heard of me and came
to consult with my Guides. Entirely apart from their business
they were interested in a silver mine in Canada and had in
vested considerable money in development work. They re
ceived good advice about the problems connected with
it,
and
several of them began coming frequently.
One day one of them appeared, and when my control Bright
Eyes began speaking to him, she told him that she saw
a
dark
cloud hanging over him, and that he would have to be very
careful or he would meet with an accident.
"Never mind all that,
I
can take care of myself," was his
grateful reply. "What
I
want to know about
is
our silver
mine."
102 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"I can tell you nothing about your silver mine at this time,"
said Bright Eyes. "Between you and the mine is a terrible
danger, and if you do not pass through
it,
the mine will mean
nothing to you.
I
see that you either are going on
a
journey or
are going to meet someone who
is
coming to the city on
a
train, and
if
you are not exceedingly careful you are going to
be hurt."
The man became angry. "I suppose that my friends have
told you
I
am
a
railroad man. Naturally we are in danger all
the time.
I
don't want any cheap warning of that sort.
I
want
to know something about our mine."
"I can tell you nothing about your mine. You must heed my
warning," were Bright Eyes's parting words.
The man left in
a
temper and when he reached home, wrote
to his wife, who was visiting in Flint, Michigan, and told her
that she probably would find
a
dead husband when she reached
home, because he had gone to
a
fake medium who would tell
him nothing, but warned him. He told her all that had been
said to him and ridiculed
it
and me. This happened on
a
Mon
day. By Thursday he had calmed down and decided to come
for another sitting.
Again Bright Eyes told him she could tell him nothing about
the silver mine. "The way
I
see it," said Bright Eyes, "you
are going to meet someone who
is
returning to this city on
a
train. You are not going to the depot you usually meet people
at, but are going to one farther out. You will stand too close
to the track and be hurt
if
you do not listen to my warning."
He asked about the silver mine, but Bright Eyes told him
she could give him nothing except this warning.
Prediction of Future Events 103
■<
He left in greater anger than before and told the men in his
office all about the warning and what he thought of
it,
ex
pecting them to laugh with him, but they did not. "Well, we
shall see who will laugh last," was his parting remark as he
went home.
The next Monday his wife was returning from Flint. Find
ing her train was late, he decided to meet her at the Sixty-
Third Street station instead of the one at Forty-Third as he
usually did and thus surprise her. Hurrying there, he arrived
shortly before the train and stood very close to the track,
watching the engine as
it
bore down on him. Witnesses say that
he seemed to reel from the tremendous suction and fall be
neath the wheels. His wife was aware that something was de
laying her train and became uneasy as she heard rumors of an
accident, remembering her husband's last letter. However,
the trainmen reassured her and she waited until their arrival
at Forty-Third Street before she got off. No husband met her.
Hurrying home, she did not find him or any word from him.
Shortly the telephone rang. With sinking heart she listened to
the request that she come to the morgue to identify
a
body
which appeared, from papers found on
it,
to be that of her
husband. There,
in
that dismal retreat, she viewed the mangled,
scarcely recognizable body of her husband.
The next day one of the men to whom he had related his
warning called me up and asked me
if
I
knew what had become
of his friend —the big man who had been to see me on Thurs
day.
I
told him
I
did not, but that my Guide had warned him of
a
bad accident.
104 The Voice Triumphant

"Well, he was killed yesterday by a train at Sixty-Third
Street."
The executives of this company came to me for sittings for
years after this, and the letter this man had written to his wife
was the means of bringing her to the place where she still could
talk with him. She came often and he told her how unfortunate
it was that mortals would not lean more on their Spirit friends
and try to understand and heed every message given them.
Our friends in Spirit never waste words or speak at random.
Frequently at the time we may not understand their message,
but we shall some day. It is because we pay such slight atten
tion to their advice that they hesitate to give it to us. Usually
their efforts are wasted.
Less spectacular than these two warnings, but just as definite
predictions, were two messages given to a young woman who
became acquainted with me. When she first began coming,
she was accompanied by her fiance, a doctor, in whose office
she worked. After a few visits Bright Eyes told her that she
would be successful as a beauty culturist and should go to school
to learn beauty culture.
She laughed.
Bright Eyes said: "You will need to know this some day."
On the way home she discussed this with her fiance, and
neither could see what the message meant. They had set no
date for the wedding, but were definitely planning for it in
the future.
About two years later this young doctor passed over and the
girl found herself without a fiance and a position at the same
Prediction of Future Events 105
«<-
time. She finally had to take a situation as a nurse girl and
general assistant about the house of her employer. While giv
ing her young charge an airing she frequently came to see me
and finally asked for a sitting.
Again Bright Eyes told her she should go to school and
learn beauty culture. "You see now what I meant when I told
you to do this two years ago," said Bright Eyes. '$You would
have saved much time and could have done it then without
worrying about the money."
The girl accepted the advice this time and became very suc
cessful in her work.
A few years later her father, who had been ailing for some
time, was advised to undergo an operation. He did not believe
in Spiritualism, but his daughter asked the doctors in Spirit
whether the operation would be best. They told her that it
would not, that without it her father could live several years
yet and would be in no pain, merely ailing somewhat. If he
underwent
it,
he would live on earth less than
a
year. The
daughter consulted her father's earthly doctors and they told
her that her father,
if
he survived the operation, would be
a
well man and live for years. Influenced
by
what they said,
father and daughter put their money together and had the
operation performed in January. After many weeks
in
the
hospital they brought the father home. He had survived the
operation, but certainly was not
a
well man. In December of
the same year he passed over. If the advice of the doctors
in
Spirit had been followed, this family would have been many
dollars ahead and still have had
a
husband and father on
earth.
(I
think
I
am justified in presuming to make the last
106 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
statement when the accuracy of the other predictions made by
the Guides about the man is considered.)
My Guides warn me frequently of many things concern
ing my own welfare. This is natural under the circumstances
and I always do my utmost to heed the warning and follow
the advice even when it seems at the time to entail considerable
sacrifice.
One day of a hot summer I called at the office of a lawyer
who was a good friend of mine.
"Oh, I am glad you came in," he greeted me, "I wanted
to ask you something. Next Saturday a big company for whom
I do some work is giving a picnic for its employees and I
should like to have you go with me. The boat leaves at seven
thirty in the morning and we would spend the whole day away
from this heat."
I was just about to say I should be glad to go when a Voice
said to me: "No, you must not. Something will happen."
I told him that I was sorry, but I must decline, because a
Voice told me something was going to happen and that I must
not go.
This man did not believe in Spiritualism, but he said: "Oh,
is that how you feel?"
"Yes," I replied, "and I should not dare go now."
The next Saturday morning he called me up to tell me that
the boat we should have been on, the Eastland, had just turned
over at her dock in the Chicago River and had thrown the
crowd of merry-makers on her decks into the water with ter
rible loss of life.

A few months ago, learning that an elderly couple, good
friends of mine, were going to Florida to spend the winter be
cause of their health, I suggested that they arrange to leave at
the same time I did and ride down in my automobile. I knew
they would be more comfortable than on the train and would
get more pleasure from the trip. We made our plans and set
Thursday as the day to start. Tuesday evening we began to dis
cuss some detail of the trip when I heard one of our doctor
friends in Spirit say: "The man is too sick to stand the journey.
He would have a relapse on the way and you would have to put
him in a hospital in some strange town, where none of you
would have any friends. If they really think he can get to
Florida, they can make reservations on the train for Sunday, to
get there the day after you do."
I told them that our spirit doctor thought the trip would be
too severe for them and that they had better take the train.
The woman was considerably disappointed. I knew I had heard
correctly, but for her sake I said that we would have a sitting
the next day in my hotel room and talk it over with our Guides.
This we did and our doctor repeated to her what he had told
me. He said that she and her husband should come by train
on Sunday if they attempted it at all at this time. They had
great faith in their Guides and, in spite of their disappointment,
knew they should do as they were advised.
Thursday came and I started with my husband. On Satur
day morning the Guides told me the man had been taken sud
denly very ill and I felt a severe pain in my stomach. On reach
ing home Sunday, I found a telegram telling me that on
Friday night he had had a severe internal hemorrhage from a
108 The Voice Triumphant
»»> >>>»»»■» >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >■>■>■»»»■>>■>»■>■
perforating ulcer in his stomach and was far too ill to be moved.
He lingered for almost two weeks before passing to Spirit. If
I had not heeded the advice of our Spirit doctor, this would
have occurred on the trip and been most unfortunate for every
one of us. Also, if the doctor had not specified Sunday as the
day for them to start on the train, they would have left earlier
and he would have had the hemorrhage on the train. In other
words, the doctor knew several days ahead the time within a
few hours when this hemorrhage would occur.
Many times when riding with my husband in an automobile
I am told of some danger ahead or something for which we
must watch out. Recently as we were traveling north, near
Charleston, South Carolina, I heard Pat say: "Medie, there is
going to be a bad wreck south of Washington tomorrow. It will
be in a rather dangerous place and you had best warn C. M.
[my husband] to drive slower and very carefully after he
leaves Richmond until he passes it."
The next evening we found it just as Pat had told me and,
because of the crowd of cars and people, would have had
trouble if we had been going at our usual pace.
Once in Chicago as my husband was leaving to get the auto
mobile for his morning journey, I heard a Voice tell me to
warn him to drive slowly between Twelfth and Thirteenth
Streets because a man in a big car would drive carelessly in
that block. At that time Michigan Boulevard was very narrow
south of Twelfth, and a reckless driver could easily cause an
accident. Reaching Twelfth Street, my husband drove very
Prediction of Future Events 109
<
carefully and slowly. He had almost reached Thirteenth Street
when a man in a Pierce Arrow car suddenly turned in front
of him right across his path. Even with all his care he had
difficulty in avoiding a smash-up.
A woman in somewhat straitened financial circumstances
came to sittings occasionally and one evening appeared to be
worried more than usual about some matter. Her Guides asked
her what the trouble was and she finally told them that an
other child was coming and she did not know how she possibly
could get the money to support this additional one. She had
two girls and a boy already.
"You must stop your worry about this," one of her Guides
told her; "you will find this child will be a great joy to you
and will take the place of others."
We did not understand exactly how to interpret this, as all
her children were sturdy, healthy youngsters. Within a year,
however, both girls passed over and she found the joy pre
dicted by her Guides, instead of worry, in the little baby. In
cidentally, the second child passed on Sunday at four o'clock in
the afternoon and came to the Sunday evening seance to greet
friends of her mother's who were present, and asked that they
go to her mother next day and console her with this message.
(The chapter "Early Manifestation" will be found interesting
in this connection.)
Several times women contemplating divorcing their hus
bands with whom they had lived and worked for years were
told by their Guides not to do so because the husband soon
HO The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
would pass to Spirit, and his possessions, which they had helped
him accumulate, would go to others.
One woman was given such a message in April and her hus
band passed over the next July.
Another woman given a similar message did not heed
it,
but
obtained her divorce.
A
few months later the man passed over
and she was left without the insurance and property which
rightfully should have been hers. When
I
say "rightfully,"
it
is
with reservations. She had worked with him helping him
to collect the property, truly enough, but
by
her willfulness,
in face of advice
by
her Guides to the contrary, she really threw
it
away.
The following case
is
illustrative of the harm which can be
caused
by
a
person who does not heed
a
warning and the advice
given
by
the Guides, and shows why those
in
Spirit become
reluctant to proffer this kind of help. Properly used,
it
would
be of great benefit, but
it
so frequently
is
either misinterpreted
or unheeded that
it
fails of its object.
A
man and his wife who were operating
a
restaurant in a
busy section of Chicago had struggled hard to build
it
up to
a
profitable business. The woman was somewhat older than her
husband, who was
a
fine-looking man, and had been
a
widow
when he married her. Both had put all their time and energy
into their work and had made
a
success of it. They began at
tending my seances and frequently were accompanied
by
three
of their patrons. During the ensuing year they had many se
ances and many wonderful tests and examples of the help
which their Guides could give them.
Prediction of Future Events in

One day while they were having a sitting, the man's father
said: "Son, it does not pay to do anything wrong. The right
way to live is the only way."
The man made no comment and the rest of us did not know
to what his father could be referring.
Several times after this the father made the same remark,
and finally the woman decided she had best find out what was
meant. She was with her husband in the restaurant most of the
day, and the few evenings he was away from home she thought
he was with their three patrons and friends and consequently
could not imagine to what his father had reference when speak
ing to him as he did.
She came for a private sitting, however, to find out. Her
father-in-law soon came and said: "May, I am going to tell you
something: Will is planning to sell the restaurant."
"Yes," she replied, "he has told me he wants a larger place."
"What he really wants," said her father-in-law, "is to sell
the place, take all the money, and run away to California with
your cashier and live there with her under an assumed name.
I am giving you this warning, but I do not want you to say a
word to him about it. Be diplomatic: just say to him: 'AH
right, we will sell the place when we can and each take half the
money. When we buy another place, we each will pay half.'
In that way you will have something for all your years of hard
work."
She went home, but instead of doing as she was told, she
allowed her jealousy to get the better of her and gave her hus
band a great lecture about his ungratefulness to her for her
years of help and ended by telling him what his father in
112 The Voice Triumphant
>.>>>>>>>»»»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >■>->.>.»»»».».>
Spirit had said.
He, of course, denied everything and talked to her so long
and convincingly that he not only appeased her completely,
but induced her to allow the cashier, whom she wished to dis
charge, to remain. He said he never had thought of doing any
thing so mean and low as she had accused him of and the mes
sage was untrue and must be a fake. To save his face, he said
he would take their three friends and show me up to be a
faker.
They arranged for a sitting, but as soon as I had left the
phone, my Guides told me I must not sit for them. I could not
understand this, because they had been coming regularly for
quite a while, and foolishly paid little attention to this warn
ing. This shows that a medium can be guilty of the same thing
as many others.
That evening just before it was time for them to arrive, I
developed a most distressing pain in my abdomen. I thought
again of what my Guides had told me and when the men ar
rived, told them I was sorry, but that my Forces did not wish
me to sit for them that evening. I said: "I do not know why
they do not want me to sit for you, but they have made me
quite ill and I must disappoint you."
They laughed a little and said they could not understand
it,
but, having come quite
a
long distance, they would be con
siderably disappointed
if
I
failed them. Finally
I
allowed my
self to be persuaded and we entered the seance room.
Why, oh why, will mortals not heed the warnings of their
friends in Spirit?
Several of their loved ones had greeted them when
I
saw
Prediction of Future Events 113
<
Pat enter the circle suddenly and, grasping a trumpet, raise it
above his head as though to hit one of them. Before the trumpet
could descend, they had flashed a light on me. The last thing
I saw as I toppled over unconscious was the trumpet falling
harmlessly to the floor. He had been too late to save me from
my own folly.
The men became quite excited and alarmed at my condition
and, calling in a neighbor, told her I had fainted and asked
her to remain with me until they could bring a physician. The
doctor remained with me until one o'clock the next morning
before I regained consciousness. For several days I was too
weak to get out of bed. Such is the harm ignorance can do.
Several days later the woman who was the real cause of all
this came to see me and told me what her husband and friends
had done. I hadn't known just what had happened until now.
She said her husband had convinced her the message was a lie
and she wanted another sitting to talk it over with her father-
in-law. I told her to get out of my home, that I was through
with anyone who could do what she had done after having
received the beautiful messages she had. I had held seances for
all of them many times without compensation, except for a
very occasional meal in their restaurant, and said I wished to
see none of them again.
Before the close of the next month the restaurant was sold
and the "misjudged" husband had taken all the money and
left with his cashier. Remembering now the message of her
father-in-law, the woman, by its help, was able to trace them to
Los Angeles. She found out that after six months there they
had spent all the money, and the ex-cashier had fallen in love
114 The Voice Triumphant
»>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>
with another, younger man. The husband wrote his wife beg
ging forgiveness, but she refused to have anything further to
do with him.
What about the rest of the actors in this little drama? How
did they fare? The deserted wife had a hard struggle, doing
cleaning by the day. She finally entered the hair-goods busi
ness and began peddling. Many times she tried to get me to
allow her to come back to my seances, but under the circum
stances I could not forgive her. All three of the men who had
come with the husband had nothing but misfortunes, one soon
meeting with a serious accident which crippled him, another
passing over with pneumonia. All three sent word to me sooner
or later that they knew they had done wrong in hurting God's
instrument and were being punished for it.
The following message was not intended as a warning, but
was given as a simple statement of fact in order that the man
might help his family. Our Guides cannot always do a thing
like this for us for three principal reasons: Many lack faith in
or have not the desire to profit by the message, both of which
are necessary conditions for the giving of such information.
A more important reason is the clouded aura of many people.
It is by means of the aura that the future of individuals is read
by the Guides. A person may have sufficient faith in what would
be told him and would go to a great deal of trouble to follow
what advice might be given him, but still have such a clouded
aura that the Guides could not read it with certainty. Very
active people, engaged in many pursuits and traveling a great
deal, are likely to be in this class, as well as those who do not
Prediction of Future Events 115
<
lead honest, upright lives. The latter by their associates and
the unhappiness they are creating for others and themselves
so obscure their aura that it shows no clear picture of the future.
On the other hand a person who leads a simple honest life
marked by fairly definite routine and is contented with what
he has, usually has an aura in which the few important events
stand out clearly and can be understood readily by the Guides.
Such a man was one who came to me occasionally for sittings.
His parents and sisters and many friends all were members of
the Center, and while he did not come as often as some of the
others, he was just as firm a Spiritualist. One day he heard of
the Chicago Tribune's accident insurance policy, which recently
had been introduced, and at his next sitting asked Pat's advice
about obtaining one in order to help his mother if anything
happened to him.
Pat said : "Yes, it will be a good thing for you to do. I can
see that when you come to us, it will be through an accident
which is covered by that policy, and your mother will be helped
that much."
He thanked Pat and obtained a policy the next day.
He had paid only three premiums when one day, while rid
ing in a taxicab, it was struck by a railroad train at a crossing
and he was instantly killed.
I have related several cases to illustrate how our Guides can
inform us of future occurrences which will affect our personal
interests.
The predictions of "Prophet," whom I mentioned at the
beginning of the book as one of my Guides, cover events which
u6 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>.> >.>.>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ».>.».».».»
will affect large numbers of people and be of concern to every
one. She gives these prophecies once a year to members of our
Center and they are of great value because they always have
proved correct to the last detail. I will not attempt any further
discussion of them here, because, as I said at the beginning of
this chapter, human beings as a whole will not believe them or
profit by them. All of the disasters and troubles of the past
year were predicted by her a year ago last December; but even
if they had been given out to the world, would they have ac
complished anything? We who understand her, however, look
forward to "Prophet's" coming each December with sincere
hopefulness, knowing she bears a message of vital interest to
us and to the world at large.

HEALING
IHAVE STATED THAT FOR MANY YEARS FRIDAY EVENING HAS
been set aside by our Guides of the Center as a night for
healing. The Spirit doctors use the Forces to take assistance
to those who are ill, and are able to do this no matter where the
person lives, provided he has established connection with the
Center, has faith in its Forces, and sits that evening in loving
concentration on his dear ones of the Other Side. To show how
wonderful and how concrete this help is I will relate the fol
lowing cases.
The story of the benefits one member of our Center re
ceived, his introduction to his Spirit friends, and the events
leading up to it is quite interesting. When he first attended one
of my seances, he was a man sixty-five years of age and almost
blind. He was born of poor, hard-working Scottish parents who
had brought him up a strict old-fashioned Baptist. When quite
young he had left home and during his wanderings at various
times had worked as a carpenter, a clerk, an insurance solicitor,
a compiler of city directories, and in many other capacities. His
ability as an inventor and promoter gradually developed and
he made and lost several fortunes. As he himself explained
it,
117
n8 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
he was not humble when wealthy and did not know how to
conserve the money he knew how to make. He became ego
tistical and somewhat arrogant at such times and, contrary to
advice and common sense, invested in worthless enterprises.
Finally one of these schemes which showed some promise
ate up the remainder of his last fortune and compelled him,
in order to retrieve any of it and to justify the faith of friends
who had invested with him, to come to Chicago and operate
the factory himself. He was not particularly well suited for
this type of work and for some time was able only to keep
the business going.
His eyesight had been failing for some time and, soon after
he reached Chicago, became so bad that even the thickest lenses
hardly enabled him to conduct his work, and it began to cause
him great concern in addition to his business worries. He never
lost his faith in God and in prayer, although many years be
fore, he had become, as he said, disgusted with orthodox re
ligion. In Chicago, however, after being treated by a number
of oculists and then told that they could do nothing for him,
he attended churches of several different denominations, but
found no help or restoration of sight in any of them. He told
me they all claimed to be followers of Jesus, but could not
render any of the blessings which Jesus commanded his fol
lowers to bestow upon mankind. Jesus said: "The kingdom of
heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
dead, cast out evils; freely ye have received, freely give."
The question arose with this man why it was that our
churches could not do these things when it is recorded that the
disciples and the earlier churches were able. There must be
Healing 119
<
some reason, because God beyond question is unchangeable,
and if such things had been once, they must still be possible
today. In his prayers now he begged to be shown the way to
this blessing he craved, believing that the path must be open
today, just as it was centuries ago, if only he could find it.
Some months after giving up hope of material help he was
called to Minneapolis on business and while there visited an
old neighbor and friend, Dr. Graham, an oculist. After ex
amining his eyes the doctor told him that the nerves were
paralyzed from nicotine and that complete blindness in the
near future was the inevitable result if smoking was not
given up.
He did not have sufficient faith in this diagnosis to subject
himself to treatment at this time or even to cease his smoking.
One month later this doctor passed to the Spirit World. Our
friend continued his prayers to be led where he could obtain
enlightenment and help, but was not prepared to recognize
it when he found it because it was so different from what he
had expected.
Early one Sunday evening while sitting in front of his
hotel he entered into conversation with a gentleman who after
some time indicated from his remarks that he was a Spiritual
ist. Being asked if this was so, he admitted it and went on to
tell of many remarkable phenomena he had witnessed.
Our friend said that he took no stock in such things, as they
seemed contrary to the laws of Nature as he understood them.
He explained that he believed in God and that there were
angels. He considered this mother had been an angel on earth
and he saw no reason why she should not be an angel in
120 The Voice Triumphant
»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
heaven, but he did not think that she could talk to him. Upon
being asked if he would like to talk with her he said: "Yes,"
but did not believe it possible. Asked if he would be afraid to
talk to her, he said: "Why should I be afraid to speak to an
angel? The only thing I am afraid of is that I am not good
enough for her to come to." He was told that if he would
preserve an open mind, even though he was skeptical, his com
panion would take him that evening to a seance. He said he
would be glad of the opportunity to seek the truth, but was
very skeptical and would accept nothing unless he had ab
solute proof that it was beyond human agency.
They arrived about eight o'clock and sat down with some
sixteen or eighteen other people. Realizing that he was the
only stranger present, he felt impelled to tell the rest that he
was a skeptic and, having been informed by his friend that a
skeptic could hamper or ruin the seance, offered to leave. He
was told to stay. (This man's whole attitude, to one who under
stands the Truth, was a fairly definite guarantee that his
friends in Spirit would be able to come through to him. He
was considerate of others, and, while he demanded proof, he
did not presume to dictate what the proof should be.)
The light was turned off, the seance began. A small music-
box held in the lap of the gentleman who brought our friend
was taken by one of his children in Spirit and was played while
being carried near the ceiling and around the chandelier. In a
few moments I heard a trumpet tap someone, and a voice
say: "Sit up straight, Mr. D—."
He was bending over with his ear close to the floor to see
if I had left my seat. It happened that his chair was very near
Healing 1 1 1
.<« < <« <. < < <« <. < <« <. < <
mine and he was able to tell by what slight movements I made
that I had not left the chair, and the music still was being
played near the ceiling. These facts, together with his being
called by name (his companion had been careful not to men
tion it), surprised him, but he said nothing at the time. He
told us these details later.
As the music ceased, a sweet feminine voice began singing
directly in front of him. At the conclusion of the second verse
he exclaimed: "That is very peculiar."
I asked him why.
He said: "My mother was a beautiful singer and taught my
six brothers and sisters, but could not make a singer of me.
However, in my boyhood, she did teach me those two verses
just as they were sung now and I do not remember ever hav
ing heard them since that time."
A voice then spoke in front of him and said: "My boy, I
have followed you all these years and finally got you down to
the hotel, but could not get you to come here. I want to thank
you, Dr. Q—, for bringing my boy to me."
As he undertook to speak, the voice continued: "Do you
remember the long years you were away from home when a
boy, and when you came back, how I tried to find out whether
you remembered the old orthodox Baptist teachings I had
given you? You told me the teachings were not true and that
you believed in a religion of love, not of fear. I have found
out that you were nearer right than I was and want to tell
you so."
Thus was proof given this man without one word being
said by him. He now spoke up and said: "That is proof
122 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■
beyond all controversy. It happened nearly forty years ago and
I have never mentioned the facts she has given, not even to
my own family."
At his next sitting a voice came to him and said : "Walter,
this is Father. I want to apologize to you for the unmerciful
floggings I gave you in your boyhood. You did not need them,
but I did not understand you. You remember the time you
went fishing on Sunday and caught that elegant string of fish
and I black-and-blued you from your hips to your shoulders?
That is what hurts me the most."
He replied: "Father, I think that they were good for me,
for they cured me of doing on Sunday what I could do on
Monday."
"That is not what I asked you, son. I asked that you for
give me."
He forgave his father freely and since that time has re
ceived many blessings from him.
Soon after this, at one of his private weekly sittings, his
mother came and said: "Boy, I am very happy; I have found
a doctor who can restore to you your eyesight."
He was very glad, but two weeks went by and no doctor ap
peared. One day at home he was thinking this over and re
called what his friend Dr. Graham had told him about smok
ing. Thinking to himself that this must be the doctor whom
his mother meant, the idea came to him that the doctor had
not come through because no effort had been made by him to
stop smoking. He then decided to limit himself to one cigar
a day and after a short time arranged for another sitting, not
at his usual hour, but without telling me the purpose of it.
Healing 123
<.
The moment the door of the seance room was closed a voice
addressed him: "How are you, old sport?"
"That must be Doctor Graham, for no one but him ever
greeted me that way."
"That is right and I have come to give you your eyesight.
You may smoke one cigar each evening, but no more."
Within the next few weeks his eyesight became better than
it had been in twenty years, and this without any medicine
or earthly help. Any doctor will corroborate the fact that
optical nerves almost completely paralyzed by nicotine re
quire special treatment, absolutely no smoking, and a very
long time to regain their sensitiveness when treated only by
earthly means. His joy and thankfulness for this blessing
was boundless. In spite of a return to moderate smoking, his
sight improved until far better than that of most men of his
age. His business gradually righted itself through the help
of his Guides and enabled him to justify the faith others had
in him. He passed to the Other Side a few years ago, blessing
Spiritualism and the medium through whom he received the
greatest boon a man practically blind could ask for.
Many years ago a young man came to my seance room who
appeared to be in bad health. During his conversations at
various times with his friends in Spirit, whom he accepted very
quickly, it developed that he was suffering from tuberculosis
of the spine. He had a very poorly paying job and no home,
lived in a furnished room, and ate his meals at restaurants.
His Guides and the Spirit doctors said that they would treat
him and help him the best they could, but were afraid they
124 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>»>.>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>.>>>
could not do much as long as he did not have wholesome,
home-cooked food. I volunteered my help and was able to
induce a family I knew well to let him have a room with them
and share their meals. With improvement in his health came
a better position. It required five years to build him up to
normal health, and all this time his Spirit friends were help
ing, supervising his diet, protecting him as much as possible
from ordinary illnesses which would retard his recovery, and
assisting him to better situations. For years he has enjoyed ex
cellent health and a good position.
This man is so grateful for the help he receives from the
Spirit World that, when he found I was writing my experi
ences as a medium, he suggested that I might give his name
and address to anyone wishing them, saying he would be glad
to answer questions concerning his case.
I believe that it is conceded generally that cancer is incur
able, in the present state of our knowledge at least, certainly
so without an operation. That even this affliction yields to the
efforts of the doctors in Spirit is proved by the case of a woman
who visited me first in New York a few years ago. She was
employed as a maid by a woman who had cancer in one of
her breasts. It became necessary to graft some skin on to this
breast and, because she was the healthiest one around the
woman, this maid gave the skin from the upper part of a
thigh. Soon after the operation she developed cancer in this
thigh. Her mistress knew she was having trouble with
it,
but
did nothing to help her. They came to America on
a
visit and
while here this maid attended several of my seances. Each
Healing 125
«<
time she was told by our Spirit physician to take good care
of her thigh. Not paying much attention to sickness in gen
eral or putting faith in the Spirit World, she did nothing about
it.
Soon after returning to England the thigh became very
bad and her mistress took her to several specialists. They in
serted
a
tube to drain
it,
but did nothing more. The mistress
was not willing to spend any money on her, and the special
ists, of course, would do nothing without it.
After
a
time they returned to America, and the maid re
sumed her attendance at seances. Again our doctor in Spirit
warned her about the thigh and told her
it
was in
a
serious
condition. The woman was so close-mouthed and reticent
about her personal affairs that none of us knew to what the
doctor was referring.
Finally one day
by
accident
I
saw the thigh. My experience
in
hospitals was sufficient to enable me to tell that
it
was in
a
critical state and
I
told her that we should have
a
sitting
immediately.
Our doctor came and said: "Well, at last
I
have been able
to get the idea through to you that you have
a
serious injury."
Then she told us the story. Of course, the doctor knew all
the time that she had cancer, but
I
did not realize
it
until
I
had seen the leg. By this time she had gained enough faith
in
her friends
in
Spirit to do what they told her, and when they
prescribed
a
certain strictly limited diet she followed
it
ex
actly. This was all they insisted that she do, other than to
have implicit faith in them—they would do the rest.
It
took over two years, but finally the wound was healed,
nothing remaining to show where
it
had been except
a
thread
126 The Voice Triumphant

of a scar about four inches long. How was this accomplished
without the aid of the surgeon's scalpel or earthly drugs? I
do not know. I know only that nothing is impossible to the
Spirit World when proper conditions are brought to it by those
seeking help.
This is another case where the person benefited is willing
to tell the story of her help to any who may wish to hear it
directly from her.
At one time a woman, a dressmaker by profession, attended
our Friday evening healing classes occasionally and became
much interested in several rather remarkable cures which she
saw effected. One night she asked our doctor if he thought that
he could help her. He told her that she seemed quite healthy
to him and wished to know in what way she thought she needed
his help. She explained that frequently she would get a sharp
pain in her back near a shoulder-blade, especially when assum
ing certain positions. The pain was momentary, leaving her as
soon as she returned to a normal posture. She had had a pain
like this for many years, but in other parts of her body. It
was only during the last year or so that she had begun to feel
it in her back. She had applied liniments and plasters, but
they had done no good. There was no mark on the skin to
indicate what might be the trouble. The doctor told her he
would examine her and let her know what he found out in a
few minutes.
The seance continued, and in a short time he spoke to her
again. He informed her that a needle was lodged in her back
and was causing the pain she experienced.
Healing 127
^^^^■(.W^•W^^W < < <.
"I suppose, then, that I shall have to have some sort of an
operation to remove
it,
shall
I
not?" she asked.
"Don't do anything for
a
while, but come back here next
Friday evening, and in the mean time
I
will see what can be
done," was his reply.
The next week when she appeared we asked her how she
felt, whether she had noticed any change. She told us she had,
that she felt the pain very frequently and more severely than
before and that
a
slight lump had appeared on her back which
hurt her very much when touched. When the doctor came in,
she told him the situation.
"Yes,
I
know all about it," he said, "I have been bringing
the needle to the surface during the week and now am ready to
try to remove it."
"Oh, but you can't do
it
here, doctor,
it
will hurt me too
much;
it
is
very sore," she cried excitedly.
"If you will have faith in me,
I
can take
it
out for you and
it
will not hurt, but
if
you have any fear or are uneasy,
it
will
be best for me not to attempt it."
She had seen considerable evidence of what he was able to
accomplish and told him she had faith in him, but was afraid
of the pain. However, she was perfectly willing for him to go
ahead and try to remove it.
He told her to turn around
in
her chair with her back toward
the center of the circle where the Forces were concentrated
and sit still for
a
few moments. She did this and all was quiet.
Finally
I
asked her
if
anything was happening. She said she
felt
a
slight pricking sensation in her back, but that was all.
Just then the doctor spoke and said: "Well,
I
have got
it
128 The Voice Triumphant

out, but it must have broken off, because it is only half of a
needle. I do not see the rest of it where this part was and there
fore shall have to look further for it."
"Oh no, doctor," exclaimed the woman, "I remember about
it now. You do not need to look any further. Years ago I ran
a needle into myself, and when I attempted to pull it out, it
broke off. I have the piece at home now. I left the other part
in the wound intending to have it removed later, but it never
caused me any trouble and I forgot about it. That must be the
piece which you have just taken out."
No pain accompanied the removal of this needle; only a
drop or two of blood appeared where it had come out. The
woman's dress was not even loosened to allow the doctor to
work. Yet the needle was removed and the woman had no
more trouble.
Remarkable as are these cures effected by the Spirit physi
cians, it is in the realm of diagnostics that they are pre-eminent.
This of course is natural because of their superior understand
ing and ability to see many things hidden from mortal sight.
During all my years of work I never have known them to
make a mistake in a diagnosis, even when it was exactly con
trary to that made by several earthly physicians.
A little boy was playing one day with a gun which he did
not know was loaded—the old, old story. When it went off,
as they all do, the very small bullet lodged in the palm of his
hand. He was taken to a doctor, but probing did not locate
the bullet. X-ray photographs were taken, but no bullet ap
Healing 129

peared on them. Not knowing the exact location, doctors hesi
tated to cut such a delicate and complex member as the hand.
It grew worse steadily until it became imperative that some
thing be done. Then the boy's mother bethought herself of her
friends in Spirit and came to consult Dr. Senn. He told her
exactly where it was lying, under a bone and invisible on the
X-ray photograph. The mother told the doctors where it was
and finally, as there was nothing else to do, they cut and found
it where he had told her. When she was asked how she knew
its location, she told them she "felt" it was there, giving no
credit to the source of her information. Does it seem just to
deny those to whom one looks for help and benefaction when
in difficulty?
A gentleman of my acquaintance was not so unjust or cow
ardly when a little daughter of his developed a sudden ex
cruciating pain. He had taken the children to see the circus
and of course peanuts, pop-corn, and all the accessories were
indulged in.
The next day one little girl became ill suddenly, screaming
with the pain in her abdomen. Her father called in their doc
tor, but he did not know what it could be and could do noth
ing. Immediately the man called me and asked me if I would
go into the seance room and consult Dr. Senn. I did so at once,
and had just come out when the worried parent appeared at
the door. He had not been able to wait and had hurried over,
so I suggested that as long as he had come, we both go back
to the seance room and let Dr. Senn tell him personally.
He was told to take the child to a hospital immediately for
130 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
an operation, that she had a peanut lodged in her appendix.
Hurrying to his doctor at the Lake View hospital in Chi
cago to make the necessary arrangements, he told what the
trouble was with his daughter. The doctor told him it was ab
solutely impossible for a peanut to become lodged in the ap
pendix and refused to operate.
The distracted father called me again and told me what his
doctor had said.
I told him to follow Dr. Senn's advice.
He insisted that they operate on his child. They finally did
so and found the peanut in the appendix. Turning to the man,
the doctor exclaimed: "My gracious, man, where did you get
your information?" He was told.
A member of the Center was ill in bed with a severe pain
very low down on one side of the abdomen. He was being
attended by two doctors, a man and his wife, who professed
to be Spiritualists. They diagnosed his pain as due to a hernia
and brought in another doctor who agreed with them and
said an operation was imperative. Our friend, sick as he was,
refused to let them do anything until he had word from Dr.
Senn.
That same evening the healing class met for its weekly se
ance. The two attending doctors were present at the seance,
and when Dr. Senn came in, we asked him about the case. He
told us that the man had a severe case of appendicitis and was
to be removed to a hospital immediately and the appendix
removed.
At this the two attending doctors, so-called Spiritualists,
Healing 131
<
became angry and said that Dr. Senn was wrong.
I promptly stopped the seance and telephoned the man,
knowing whose advice he would take. He was rushed to the
hospital, and the appendix removed. It was almost bursting
from pus.
The angry doctor whose diagnosis was disbelieved refused
to take anyone's word until he was shown the appendix. After
viewing it I laughed at him and asked him what he thought
of his "hernia" now.
A young girl had been suffering for some four years with
what several doctors told her were gall-stones. She was not
satisfied with what any of them told her and refused to be
operated on. Finally she heard of me and arranged for a pri
vate sitting. She explained to Dr. Senn her difficulty and was
told by him that it was appendicitis and not gall-stones at all.
I took the girl myself for examination to a doctor who, I
had been told, was very good and conscientious. He also diag
nosed gall-stones and wished to operate. I refused to let him.
He then asked the girl if she was willing to undergo an op
eration for appendicitis when he diagnosed gall-stones. She
said she was, but would not have it done unless I was present.
He demurred at this, saying I might faint or otherwise create
a disturbance in the operating-room. The girl refused to let
him do anything unless she was assured I was to be present.
Finally he agreed to this and told me the operation would take
place at nine thirty the next morning. I promised to be there
at that time and the girl went to the hospital.
When I got home, Dr. Senn informed me that the man
132 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>>>
had not told us the truth, that he intended to operate at eight
o'clock. Well, Mrs. Cook' was there at a quarter to eight, to
the astonishment and considerable chagrin of the doctor, who
already was preparing for his work. So sure was he that he
was right, and somewhat angry that his diagnosis should be
questioned by one of the laity, and a woman at that, he had
asked a professor at one of the medical colleges to witness the
operation.
We went into the operating-room, the incision was made,
and the gall-bladder examined. It was soft, with no evidence
of gall-stones, and was pronounced by the professor to be in
fine condition. The professor himself next suggested that the
appendix be investigated. Looking daggers at me (I was
smiling), the doctor did so and found it enormously enlarged,
yellow with gangrene, and in generally terrible shape. It really
was a wonder the girl lived.
When the operation was finished, the doctor turned to me,
slapped me on the shoulder, and wanted to know "who the
hell" I was and how I knew it was the appendix. I told him, and
while he never professed belief in my Truth, he did come to
me after that whenever a case "stumped" him and asked my
opinion.
In detailing these cases it is not my intention or desire to
cast any reflection on the doctors of our earth plane, because
as instruments for the application of means to relieve suffer
ing they are indispensable. I merely wish to emphasize the
fact that they are human and subject to the same proportion
of mistakes as are all other human beings. It is because of the
acute and vital nature of their work, however, that they should
Healing 133
<
be more anxious than most, and should consider it their duty,
to investigate and make use of any and all means of rendering
their work less subject to error. It is most unfortunately true
that as a class they do not do this and adopt a very positive
attitude and assume supreme knowledge of their field, under
the plea that such an approach is necessary to put the patient
in the proper mental condition to have complete confidence
in them. Wide acquaintance among members of the medical
profession has shown me that, regardless of the theory of their
attitude, it results from their training and habits of thought.
Because they have acquired a specialized knowledge of a cer
tain branch of human wisdom and have formed an organiza
tion strong enough to give them considerable political power
and earning capacity, most of them have become egotistical
and arrogant, denying that any but members of their organiza
tion have knowledge sufficient to alleviate human physical
suffering.
I have attempted to show that even in their specialized field
of diagnostics and healing they have much to learn and are
far inferior in knowledge to their fellow doctors in Spirit.
That they have even less reason to assume the attitude they
do than is ordinarily supposed will become apparent when it
is considered that practically all major advancements in medi
cal science in recent years have been made by men of other
professions, not by members of the medical profession. The
newer remedies, the phenomenally improved hypnotics, an
aesthetics, and antiseptics, all have been the work of chemists.
The isolation of the germs of the more obscure diseases, such
as influenza, has been the work of bacteriologists. The exact
134 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>•
nature of the course of a disease with the identification of the
morbid compounds and products produced in the body and
with this the intelligent application of counteracting chemicals
has been the work of the pathologist, assisted by the chemist.
Even the functioning of the normal body is being worked out
by the physiologist and biologist. All these workers are toiling
tirelessly to put in the hands of the physician knowledge and
weapons with which to combat human suffering.
A careful perusal of medical journals, if the authorities
should consider them morally fit to be read by the laity, in
comparison with journals in the fields I have mentioned above
will bring out very strongly what I have been trying to say.
It will be found that nearly all the articles in the medical jour
nals are accounts by some physician or surgeon of what he
did or what happened in one or a half-dozen isolated cases.
There is no evidence of a carefully planned and systematically
worked-out course of action which resulted in a definite con
clusion which would be safe to follow in the average similar
case. Lengthy accounts are given of a case where one right
foot is longer than the left, or of the way in which a rachitic
infant was deformed, or of the vagaries and actions of a moron.
A surgeon will suture a perineal tear a certain way and give
a long account of one case. Usually there is no word of the
ultimate result in many cases or its general applicability. If
the results in many cases are given, it will be found they were
so variable, though the underlying causes of the variability
were not determined, or at least mentioned, that no definite
conclusion can be made.
Now pick up a chemical journal and read the account of the
Healing 135
.«.«.<«.«
discovery of a new compound ; how the investigator planned
a definite course of action, how he tried method after method
which did not work and why they did not work; and finally
how he made the new compound and just how he did it. Any
properly trained man can now make that same compound.
Or read how a chemist thought a certain class of compounds
would exhibit improved local anaesthetic action and how he
systematically worked out the method of manufacturing the
compounds and then tested them and proved himself correct.
Again I say that the arrogance assumed by the medical pro
fession is unjustified by fact, and the political activity resulting
in the passing of laws prohibiting any other agency from al
leviating human suffering is unfair and definitely detrimental
to progress. Such a course of action is no more fair or neces
sary than an organization of railroads forcing through laws
to prohibit aeroplane travel because the new way detracts
from the prestige and income of the old. It is strictly up to the
old order to improve itself until it is equal to the new order
or to adopt
it,
not attempt to throttle it. The doctor's responsi
bility to humanity should make
it
obligatory upon him to avail
himself of every means for helping humanity.

PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS
THE
PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS OUR FRIENDS IN SPIRIT ARE
able to bring to us are very interesting and wonderful. To
many people, however, Spiritualism means nothing but table-
tipping, rappings, noises in "haunted" houses, and similar
phenomena. Of these people, those who have given some
thought to the subject say: "It seems to me that if there is a
life after death, it must be a higher and better life than this
on earth and I cannot see why my friends who are living it
have not better things to occupy their time than such childish
pursuits. My friend the professor who taught zoology at col
lege did not spend his time rapping on walls and tipping up
tables while on earth ; why should he be playing foolishly that
way in the Spirit World?"
On the face of it such an argument is reasonable and indi
cates that the individual presenting it has a better understand
ing and opinion of the useful and dignified life being led by his
loved ones on the Other Side than those staid church-going
folk and fanatical missionaries and revivalists who believe and
- teach that when we become angels, we are supposed to do
nothing but flap our wings once in a while and strum a harp for
God's benefit. If this were so, how monotonous and tiresome
137
138 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
life must be for the angels, and especially for God, who has
listened to this for so many sons!
If further thought is given the subject, a different point of
view evolves. Most people obtain impressions more quickly
and clearly when their physical senses are appealed to than
when their minds must be exercised to reason out a question.
Even those used to thinking are often in a lazy mood and will
react to a sense stimulus before they will to a mental stimulus.
If our Guides and friends, understanding this, can by such
means prove their actuality to doubters or impress it more
firmly upon those who believe, are they not justified in doing
so? When a daughter living in the Spirit World can come to
her mother and give her a flower grown there, thus proving
that her life continues amid surroundings similar to those on
earth, is she not giving her mother a most beautiful experience
and a remembrance to be treasured always? Every time the
flower is looked at, even when faded and pressed between the
yellowing leaves of a book, the consoling and cheering thought
comes: "This is the flower my little girl brought me from
her garden in Spirit soon after she left us for her new home."
Anyone, no matter how ignorant or hardened in the ways of
this world, could understand and appreciate such an expe
rience. I certainly maintain that any Spirit friend's time and
effort spent in giving a manifestation of this sort is well em
ployed.
This actually occurred many years ago one cold evening in
February at a private sitting I was giving to the mother, father,
small brother, and two friends of a little girl who recently had
passed over to the Spirit side of life. She already had proved
Physical Manifestations 139
< <<
her continued existence to them by many tests, and so con
vincingly that they now brought conditions to the seance room
which gave her sufficient power to give them this most won
derful experience. They had been talking with the child for a
few moments this evening when she said: "Mamma and
Papa, I am going to leave you for a few minutes, but will come
back with a surprise for you."
All was quiet for a time and I began to wonder what was
going to occur or whether something had happened to the
Forces.
Just as I was about to put my thoughts into words, the
mother exclaimed: "I smell flowers, I think they are roses."
"Why, yes," said her husband, "I smell roses plainly."
The odor now filled the room. Suddenly a startled exclama*
tion came from the mother: "Oh! they just laid something in
my lap. It feels like a rose, because there are thorns on the
stem. May I pick it up?"
"Certainly," came her daughter's voice, "it is a rose; I
brought it to you and here is another one."
With that, one more was placed on her lap. Then the child
gave two to her father, two to her brother, and two to each
of the friends. Delighted comments and heartfelt thanks came
from all.
"This is the worst of being a medium," I lamented finally;
"you bring joy to everyone else, but no one brings it to you."
"Now, Medie," remonstrated the child, "I have not for
gotten you. Wait just a moment."
Soon one, then two roses were laid in my lap.
"You see, Medie, I was not leaving you out. I had just a
140 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»»»»■>.>.»■>.»» »>»»»>■»»>>>>>
dozen and I was going to give two to each of you."
I really had not meant what I said, but indeed I did feel
much happier that she had planned her gifts so carefully.
As a sequel to this: I already have mentioned that this took
place in February. The next day from curiosity I visited a
florist and asked him if he could sell me a dozen roses like the
one I showed him. "A dozen!" he exclaimed; "I could not
sell you one. This is just the time when you cannot get roses
in Chicago. Where on earth did you get such a beauty, a bud
just opening up, that wonderful color, and a stem of such
length?" I did not tell him, but visited two other florists, both
of whom told me the same thing. Unknown to me at the time,
the father of the little girl had taken one of his blossoms to
several of the leading wholesale florists in the Loop and had
been told the same thing.
On another occasion in New York flowers were brought to
a man by his daughter in Spirit. This elderly father was an
artist of note, and, hearing from a friend that most beautiful
flowers could be brought into the seance room, he asked his
daughter if she could bring one to him and what he would
have to do to help her. "You have to do nothing, Father,"
was the answer; "you have come in love and faith, and that
is all that is necessary. I knew you were going to ask me this
evening for a flower, so I have prepared one for you. Wait just
a minute."
After a few moments of silence a slight rustle was heard as
something was laid on his knees. "Oh, Medie, she has given
me a whole bouquet. I thought I was asking too much when I
asked her for one. I thank her so much I cannot express it. I
Physical Manifestations 14.1
< <- < <<- < < < <
wonder what kind of flowers they are."
I told him they smelled like sweet peas to me. His daughter
then spoke and told him they were. When the light was turned
on after the seance was over, we found he had a most beautiful
bouquet of white sweet peas.
Flowers are not the only things which our Spirit friends
are able to bring us from the Other Side. One day in New
York I was sitting for a stranger for the first time. A very
unusual occurrence took place soon after the seance began. My
little daughter Gertrude came in and spoke to the man.
Hello, Mr. —. I like you. You have a little boy and girl in
Spirit. You make nice hats and my papa needs a hat. Will
you make him one?"
The man was considerably taken aback, but he said: "Cer
tainly I will make your father a hat. I will make him one for
five dollars that sells usually for forty. What kind does he
want?"
Gertrude described exactly what she wished him to make
and told him she would pay for it.
This man came back the next week bringing a beautiful hat
with him. We went into the seance room. I was carrying a ten-
dollar bill in my hand and, after turning out the light and sit
ting down, placed it on my lap, expecting Gertrude to take
it and give it to the man. After one or two of his friends had
come in, Gertrude spoke.
"Papa's hat is wonderful. Please hold your hand out with
the palm up."
He did so and she placed a ten-dollar gold piece in it.
"The hat is worth more than five dollars and I want you
142 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
to have what I have given you."
I felt in my lap and found the bill still was there. Surprised,
I asked the man what she had given him.
Before he could answer, she told me it was a ten-dollar gold
piece; that she had asked for the hat, had said she was going
to pay for
it,
and had paid for it.
I
was to keep my bill.
I
then explained to him that
I
had brought
a
bill into the
seance room expecting Gertrude to take
it
and give
it
to
him.
She was not satisfied with paper money; she used gold to
pay her bills, she informed us. Incidentally, this was at the
time when gold money practically was out of circulation, as
many of my readers will remember happened during the war.
The bringing of such apports as
I
have mentioned
is
one
phase of the physical manifestation of our Spirit friends'
power. Another phase
is
the materializing seance. While
I
have
this power,
I
have not made
a
practice of holding such seances
and therefore will not discuss them. Table-tipping and rappings
need not be dealt with at length, although several amusing in
cidents have occurred at such meetings. When
I
was new at
my work,
I
would hold any sort of seance my guests asked
for, but
I
soon found out that amusement and not spiritual
guidance was all that many were seeking. As
I
was not in the
entertainment business, profitable as
it
might have been for
me,
I
soon ceased holding such demonstrations.
I
should like
to mention one of them, however, because of the lesson
it
gave with all its amusement.
A
group of us had joined hands about
a
small but heavy
Physical Manifestations 143
:<
table and were receiving the usual tippings and movements
when suddenly one of the young women present let out a
stifled scream.
I had noticed her when she came in, a fairly good-looking
girl with a head of wonderful black curls, very haughty and
quite well satisfied with herself. From the few remarks she
had made, it was evident she considered she was giving our
Spirit friends a treat by allowing them to communicate with
her. She had come to please an acquaintance, not from any de
sire of her own to learn about her friends in Spirit.
We asked her what the trouble was, but she would not
tell us.
When the seance was over and the light turned on, we all
looked in her direction and saw a straggly head of hair instead
of the beautiful curls, puffs, and waves she had exhibited when
she first came in! All around the table on the floor were ly
ing the rats with which her coiffure had been stuffed. None
of the hauteur was visible in her attitude, as she gathered up
her belongings hurriedly and departed. I hope she regarded
this lesson —that unwarranted pride never should supplant
humbleness —in the light in which it was given and profited
by it.
On another occasion at a public seance we were favored by
the presence of a very smart and shrewd gentleman. There
was nothing which he did not know all about; the Spirit
World would have its hands full trying to fool him!
The seance began and soon he was addressed by some friend
of his in Spirit. He would not accept the dear one, and his
144 The Voice Triumphant
>-»■»■»» >>>>>>> ■»->■>■» >■» >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
remarks were so irritating that finally Snowdrop told him she
would fix him if he was not more polite and amiable. At the
next opportunity he began again. Suddenly we heard a gasp
from his direction. Then people in different parts of the room
felt something touch them which a few thought felt like hair.
Every few moments I heard him say softly in a pleading tone:
"Please, Snowdrop."
Each time she would laugh. Finally she said: "All right, I
will take pity on you this time, but never come again to a se
ance and act as you have this evening. Next time I will not
be so easy with you."
None of us found out what had been going on.
Next week he appeared again and, shortly after the seance
started, began making his sarcastic remarks.
Snowdrop warned him, but it made no difference.
A little while later we heard a gasp from him and a sound
as though something had been torn from his hands. Again we
felt hair brushed across our hands. His pleading "Please,
Snowdrop," commenced.
This time Snowdrop paid no attention to him. Needless to
say, we were considerably mystified and very curious. When
the light was turned on at the close of the seance, in the center
of the circle we saw a toupee. Involuntarily every eye focused
on our smart friend, now bald as the egg of the roc found by
Sindbad the Sailor, as he lunged for his hirsute falsifier. Gone
completely was his smartness, his overbearing egotism, as he
hurried out amid most undignified laughter.
He had come to this seance determined to show Snowdrop
he could act as he pleased whether she liked it or not. No feel
Physical Manifestations 145
«.<
ing of respect for his hostess even occurred to him. He was
going to hold tight to his top piece and then say what he
pleased. Whether in an unguarded moment or in spite of him,
Snowdrop removed
it,
to teach him
a
lesson of respect to his
hostess and to those who were superior in every way to himself.
Three years later he came back to me and apologized for
his behavior, saying that he realized now how wrong he had
been.
At seances held for small groups of people in their own
homes many very interesting demonstrations have been given.
Usually these seances have been held to commemorate
a
birth
day or some other special occasion, and, all the people present
being friends, those
in
Spirit have exerted themselves to make
the party joyous, knowing they would not be misunderstood
•
as might happen
if
strangers were there.
One time
a
group of us at such
a
gathering were sitting in
a
small dining-room. With the chairs as close together as pos
sible, the circle occupied all available space
in
the room except
that left in the center. After some beautiful singing
by
several
of those in Spirit one of them told us not to be alarmed, as
they were going to have
a
little fun, but would not hurt any
thing. We heard
a
drawer pulled out of the sideboard stand
ing
in
one corner of the room, then
a
short silence. Next
a
startled exclamation from
a
stout man who was sitting
in
front
of it. Asked what the trouble was, he told us he and his chair
had been picked up off the floor and put down again
a
foot or
two inside the circle. Lifting
a
two-hundred-pound man in
a
146 The Voice Triumphant
>-y»>>>-» >>>>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
chair placed so that no human person could get behind or on
either side of it is no mean physical feat, as you will agree. He
told us he felt no one near him and felt no one touch him as he
was being moved.
"We had to move you because you were too close to the
sideboard to allow the drawers to be opened," said one of my
Guides.
Soon table-linen was piled on several persons. Next cut glass
and china was being handed round. "Don't worry, Mamma,"
said the hostess's little girl in Spirit, "we will not hurt any of
your dishes."
She sensed her mother's unspoken thought. During the rest
of the seance each person held some one or more articles from
that sideboard. I had a large cut-glass fruit-dish put in my lap
which I had to hold with my hands to prevent its falling off.
When the light finally was turned on, not a thing was found
harmed in any way.
Another time we were holding the seance in a kitchen. After
the seance had been going on for a half-hour or so, our Guides
told us they were going to have a little fun and for us not to be
alarmed. First a man in the circle on the opposite side of the
room from me was handed a piece of cloth which upon feeling
he found was an apron. He was told to spread this on his lap
carefully. Next I felt my chair suddenly lifted up and moved
forward. Being naturally of a rather nervous temperament,
I gave a slight scream, which brought a volley of questions
from those in the circle.
"Medie was too close to the stove, we had to move her,"
Physical Manifestations 147
<-
said Snowdrop.
We heard some metal banged on the stove and then a gasp
from the man who had been given the apron.
"Why, they have given me the top of the stove," he in
formed us.
"Yes, and that won't be all," said one of the children. "Be
careful you keep it all on the apron so you won't get your
clothes dirty."
The oven doors were opened and the wire racks inside taken
out and handed to the man. Even a burner (this was a gas
stove) was taken off and piled on the other things. We asked
Pat why he allowed the children to act this way.
"Well," said he, "you see, they are having a good time and
I can't control them anyway."
"Yes," said one of the little ones, "Pat is doing all the lift
ing. The iron is too heavy for us and we could not handle it
without his help."
When the seance was over, this man's hands and lap were
a sight ; there was dirt all over them. No others in the room
had a speck on them.
Was this all meaningless horseplay? Think a moment. The
only person in the room with dirt on his hands was our friend
upon whom had been piled the various parts of the stove and
he was on the opposite side of the room from the stove. For
myself I had on a white, rather thin dress which would have
shown any trace of dirt most plainly. Any attempt on my part
to pass behind my chair, even after it had been moved out from
the stove, would have brought me in contact with the per
sons on either side who of necessity were sitting with chairs
1 48 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>
touching mine. It served as a further very vivid proof to these
people that the medium was not the one who performed these
miracles. Under the conditions obtaining, all of which I have
not taken the time to mention, it was obvious to those present
that I could not have done these things even had I wished.
As I have said in several other places in this book, our friends
in Spirit never waste words; they do not say things without
a purpose and do not give physical manifestations without an
object, no matter how trivial or cloaked with amusement such
words or actions may appear at the moment.
Another time I was holding a seance at the home of an
Irish family in celebration of the birthday of one of the mem
bers. These people dearly loved any fun their friends in Spirit
could have in their home and did not worry in the least, no
matter what was touched or handled. Some of the children in
Spirit decided to play the phonograph and did so, winding it
up, putting a record on, and starting it. After the first record
the host began asking for certain selections he knew were in
the cabinet. Each one was played as he asked for
it,
not one
mistake being made. Not only this, but needles were changed
and records started at the beginning, not too soon or too late.
Remembering all this took place in absolute darkness,
is
it
not
a
very clear demonstration of power that
is
supernatural?
Sometimes physical demonstrations act as very definite tests
to some one individual present at the seance and not to the
group at large. Such was the case on one occasion when
a
Spirit
came
in
and without
a
word began pinching
a
certain woman.

About three weeks before, a man and his wife who came
regularly to the Sunday evening seances appeared with a
stranger. This man was a good friend of theirs who had come
to them on an unexpected visit just as they were leaving for
the Center. They told him where they were going and he
asked to accompany them. After getting into the seance room
the woman discovered that the man was somewhat nervous
and, being a practical joker, decided to have fun with him.
In this case her "fun" was decidedly misplaced, and had I
been aware of what was going on, I should have stopped the
seance immediately. She had the chair next to his and began
touching him and giving him sly pinches. He of course thought
the "spirits," whom he had had no opportunity to find out
were his friends, were doing this to torment him. Several times
during the evening Snowdrop addressed the woman and asked
her: "Please stop; don't do that."
The woman understood what Snowdrop meant and was
the only one in the room who did. Nevertheless she kept it up.
When the seance was over, the man was almost a wreck, so
frightened was he. Finding in what condition he was, the
woman did not have the nerve to tell him, as she first intended,
that she had been the one who had tormented him. Neither
did she dare tell her husband.
So on this Sunday evening when some Spirit was giving her
pinches, and no gentle ones, she was the only one who knew,
as yet, what she had done three weeks previously. However,
as this man had left them in good health, she did not connect
the two incidents and finally cried out: "Goodness, what on
earth have I done? Someone has been pinching me ever since
150 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
the seance began and it hurts. They must have it in for me."
Then a voice spoke: "I am doing nothing more to you than
you did to me three weeks ago."
"Who are you?" she asked.
"I am Frank."
"That can't be, because Frank left us only a few days ago
and was feeling fine."
"I am Frank and passed over yesterday. You can find out
by writing to my friends in the East. I am just giving you a
little of your own medicine so that next time you won't frighten
anyone you bring into the seance room. I want to thank you
both, though, for bringing me that once. It has helped me
greatly to realize what has happened. As soon as I passed, I
thought of that evening, and it made everything much clearer
to me."
After he ceased speaking, the woman explained to us what
she had done that previous Sunday evening and vowed that
next time any stranger was present, she would keep her hands
to herself. This was good proof to her that what she did to
mortals here on earth was noted well on the Other Side and
remembered, and that retribution, sometimes at least, was as
prompt as it was inevitable.
This remark of Frank's I have heard many times in the
seance room. "I did not believe in the Truth while on earth,
but the seances I attended helped me much, when I passed
over, to understand what had happened and where I was."
Our friends make this remark frequently, and while they may
not have been grateful to us while on earth for what we tried
to do for them, they are later, after passing over.

EARLY MANIFESTATION
IHAVE FOUND A WIDESPREAD BELIEF THAT A PERSON WHO
passes to the Spirit World cannot manifest his presence
through a medium for a considerable period. Some people
think it takes quite a number of days, although most have
no definite idea of the length of time; in their minds it is just
"a long time." Denying the presence of a loved one merely
because his coming is more prompt than they think it should
be is very unjust to the medium and to the one in Spirit. My
experience always has been that the manifestation can occur
in a very short time; a mere matter of a few hours or even a
few minutes. The more familiar the one who passed is with
Spiritualism, the more prompt his appearance as a rule. I have
given several illustrations of this in other parts of the book
and consequently will mention only a few additional ones here.
One day in New York an acquaintance of mine telephoned
and asked me if I would have time to see her and a friend.
When they arrived, I found the woman's friend never had
been to a seance before, but was anxious to attend one.
A few minutes after the light was turned out, a voice said:
"Hello, Tillie."
I5i
152 The Voice Triumphant
>•>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>> ».»»»»».»»> >>>>>> >>>>>> >
The strange woman answered: "This sounds like you,
Emma."
"And it certainly is," replied her sister in Spirit. "You think
this may not be me because I only passed over at four o'clock
this morning, but you know that I was a Spiritualist and I
was prepared for my passing. As soon as it occurred, I sought
out Mrs. Cook and have been ready to speak with you when
ever you should come."
She went on to give details about the way she wished her
funeral conducted, and discussed it as she would any other
matter of personal interest.
Another woman known to me personally while in this life
passed over one Saturday. The next evening she came to the
seance and told her relatives she wished her body to be cre
mated and gave them her wishes about the various other de
tails of the funeral.
On another occasion I held a seance in the room where stood
a man's casket. He came to us and said: "There lies my body
and it served me well while I needed it. I do not need it now
in my new home because God has given me a better one. I
am very happy and do not want you to cry or grieve. Think of
me as much happier than I ever was before and you then will
feel better." The funeral was held the next day.
One young woman I had met two or three times went to
a hospital to undergo an operation. She was no great believer
in Spiritualism, although her mother and aunt were, and sub
mitted to this operation against the advice of our Spirit doc
Early Manifestation 153

tors. She had decided that she had a tumor, and a tumor it
must be. Our doctors in Spirit told her there was nothing the
matter with her that required any operation, but finally, as
she was so insistent, said that she could enjoy her little party
if she wanted it,although they were warning her that she was
risking her life. The operation was performed and no tumor
was found.
For some days she appeared to be recovering and regaining
her strength. Seeing this, it was judged safe to give her
a
rather hearty breakfast one morning when she asked for
it.
A
few minutes after finishing it she suddenly developed
a
most excruciating pain and asked that her mother be notified.
Her mother called me immediately and asked what our Spirit
doctors thought about it.
I
was told that the Spirit doctors were
doing their best to save her, but her mother had best go to the
hospital immediately.
I
telephoned this message and then set out for the city on
a
necessary errand. At twelve thirty o'clock, while
in
a
large,
crowded department store,
I
suddenly beheld this young
woman's spirit
in
front of me.
I
told my companion what
I
had seen, and said that she must have just passed over.
I
telephoned the hospital and found that she had passed
over at twelve o'clock, only thirty minutes before
I
saw her.
She had been thinking of me as she was lying
in
her bed and
sought me out as soon as her spirit was released from her
body. Her mother had not been there at the time because
subsequent word from the hospital that her daughter appeared
to be resting easily had caused her to disregard the urgency
of the message
I
had given her.
154 The Voice Triumphant

One evening I was enjoying dinner at the home of a friend
of mine when I suddenly saw a spirit form build up before
me. I recognized him as a member of the Center who had
been ill with cancer of the throat and I was just about to tell
my friends I thought he must have passed over when I was
seized by a most distressing choking sensation. I could not
speak for several minutes, to the considerable alarm of my
companions, who were unable to imagine what the trouble
could be. When I was able to speak, I told them I had seen
this man and now, after my seizure, was certain that he had
just passed over. We called his home by telephone and were
informed that he had passed only twenty minutes previously
from a paroxysm of choking.
It happens very frequently that I am given the condition
felt by a spirit at the time it passed over. This invariably is
very painful to me and lasts for periods of a few seconds to
several minutes. It usually is given me for purposes of identifi
cation to convince some person of his Spirit friend's presence
and under this circumstance lasts until the identification is
made. Fortunately for me, this sort of test is so definite and
vivid that recognition usually is prompt.
In the particular case related above, the condition was given
me, not as a test for anyone, but to impress upon me the fact
that he really had passed and to tell me how it had occurred.
One family I knew well for years brought their children
with them whenever they came for a seance. One little girl
began coming when she was two years old. She was as familiar
with her friends in Spirit as she was with those on the earth
Early Manifestation 155
<
plane. During her seventh year she became seriously ill and
passed over one Sunday afternoon at four o'clock. That same
evening she was the first one to come at our regular Sunday
evening seance. None of her family were there, but her famil
iarity with her Spirit friends while she had been on earth had
taught her where to come. She told us that nothing was strange
to her and that she was with her little sister and cousin, both
of whom had preceded her to her new home. She was very
happy and wanted us to tell her mother so that she would not
cry any more. We did, and, while missing the sight of her
daughter, the mother ceased her tears and thought of her
daughter's happiness instead of her own grief.
That we mortals should grieve when a loved one passes
over is only natural. Grief and sorrow accompany love and are
an integral part of
it,
just as joy and happiness are. Our com
panionship with
a
loved one brings us joy, and our separation
entails sorrow. Criticism or blame from those we love
is
a
hundred times harder to bear than
it
is
from one to whom we
are indifferent.
When
a
dear one passes over, we no longer can feel his
companionship in
a
human way, no matter how well we under
stand Spiritualism or believe in
it,
and grief
is
inevitable. We
must try, however, to keep our sorrow within bounds and as
suage
it
as much as possible
by
communicating with our loved
one and feeling that he at least
is
better off than he was while
on earth, especially
if
he had been sick or ailing in any way.
We must not allow our grief to become so intense that we long
to go to the Other Side to be with our friends before our time
156 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>».>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
to pass over has arrived. We are put on this earth for certain
experiences, and if we cannot be happy here or work out a
satisfactory life, we shall not be happy in Spirit. Many people
think that the Spirit World is such a wonderful place, and
their friends so happy there, that they spend much of their
time thinking about it and longing to pass over. There is hap
piness and beauty on earth, and it must be appreciated before
any joy can be found in Spirit. The happiness and beauty in
Spirit is created by the loving labors of those living there and
does not exist, at least for a long time, for anyone who cannot
create his own happiness on earth.
I have given several illustrations of the manifestation of a
loved one very shortly after passing. It is my belief that their
demonstration could be a matter of minutes if the opportunity
were given them. Already I have said that a mortal acquainted
with Spiritualism usually can return more quickly than one
who is not. This is not necessarily so. To those in Spirit a
medium on the earth plane stands out conspicuously among
her fellows. I might compare her to a lighthouse whose rays
are visible and a guide to those out on the unmarked ocean.
To those in Spirit she stands out that plainly, and a new-comer
to the Spirit World who was not a Spiritualist on earth can
see her just as plainly as one who was, although he may not
understand immediately what she is or can do for him.

A PRAYER
Watch o'er us and help us, Lord, we pray;
We ask this in Thy blessed name.
Oh! guide our lives from day to day
And make our hearts with Thine the same.
Give us true charity and love
For all the creatures here below.
Humility with strength and faith,
On us these precious gifts bestow.
Help those, O Lord, who are depressed
And who in sorrow turn to Thee.
Thou in Thy wisdom knowest best;
Grant them the grace that they may see
That all Thy ways are fraught with good,
Of all, Thou lovest them the best.
They are Thy chosen ones and should
With Thee at last be ever blest.

SPIRITUAL WEALTH
THAT
A LOWLY POSITION ON EARTH DOES NOT IMPLY LACK OF
spiritual development I will show by the story of a motor-
man who came to my seance room and gave a complete account
of the tragic accident which caused his passing over to the
Other Side. A life well lived in honest effort to fulfill all
proper obligations and an earnest desire to treat one's fellow
human beings with justice and to help them in their difficulties
is a far better way of insuring spiritual advancement and hap
piness than the mere attainment of the highest positions and
power on earth. If a responsible position and fame may be
secured while living a spiritual life, the highest possible de
velopment on earth is realized. Such is the case with many,
our beloved Abraham Lincoln in particular. The multitude of
us, however, are not fitted or destined for such a supremely
happy combination of achievements and must live our lives
to the best of our ability in accordance with our understanding
of the right, in the firm conviction that our efforts are demon
strating their worth on the Other Side far more accurately
than they may be doing on earth, and that our just reward
awaits us even though we receive it not here. What does a
delay of a few years, certainly not over one hundred, really
159
160 The Voice Triumphant •
>».>>>>».>».>->->».>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>.>>>>
matter in the end to our soul's happiness in its progress during
uncounted centuries?
It would be a very depressing thought to believe that all
the marvelous human accomplishments before recorded his
tory have gone for naught because we find only their mutilated
remains. All the labor and thought and love which brought
them forth developed the souls of the workers, and this de
velopment is retained by the soul as its reward in spite of the
destruction of the physical evidence of the labor. We may say
that all our labors result in an achievement which can be di
vided into a physical and a spiritual part. The physical evi
dence may be lost or destroyed, but the spiritual is permanent
and remains an integral part of the soul's experience. Thus,
although our efforts may not appear to receive on earth the
rewards to which they are entitled, our souls are benefited and
retain this benefit permanently. It is evidenced by Spiritual
strength and power when we reach the Other Side, as will
be seen from this story of the motorman.
A soul unused to communicating with those on earth is
usually unable to give its first message with much strength
or to remain in the circle for more than a short time, even
when its loved ones have come with the best possible condi
tions. Considerable spiritual development is required to be
able to prolong this message.
One evening in 191 8 two quiet women appeared at my
home, the Stead Center in Chicago, among many others com
ing to attend a public seance. So large was the number that I
doubted whether I could accommodate everyone at a single
Spiritual Wealth 161
<- <. <■ < < <. <■ < < <■ < < < < <
seance. Finally, however, all were seated, crowding the room
to the utmost, and the lights were turned out.
It would be well if I paused at this point to remind my
readers that the medium can see much that average mortal
eyes cannot. So clearly do I frequently behold loved ones on
the Other Side that I am at a loss to distinguish between them
and those in the flesh. I cannot explain this except to say that
to some are given the gift of music, to others painting, and to
others still the gift of mediumship. While the seance room to
mortals is dark it is not so to those on the brighter side of life
nor, to a lesser degree, to the medium.
We had sung our opening hymn and repeated the Lord's
Prayer, and I could see plainly many dear ones of Spirit. They
formed such a multitude that they extended out into the hall
way and into all the rooms in the upper part of the house.
These two quiet women sat behind me near the seance-room
door and had spoken no word since entering the room. They
made no comment, uttered no sound.
As I watched this loving gathering of the dear ones on the
Other Side, I saw one man of medium stature hurrying
through, pushing his way, pleading his way to the circle. He
brought great strength with him—the strength of a life well
lived. He came as in a pathway of light emanating from the
two little ladies, who never before had been within a spiritual
seance.
As this eager, determined man passed behind my chair, I
turned and saw him stop directly in front of these women.
Without picking up a trumpet he called in a clear natural
voice: "Mary, oh, my Mary, this is Peter."
1 62 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>•*>>>>>
Mary, his wife, sobbing gently, said: "I am so happy to
think you come, but, Peter, dear, why did you have to leave
us that way? Why did you have to leave us at all?"
"Mary, dear, and Emma, my sister Emma, listen to me
attentively. I was on my street-car that day, not two weeks ago,
out on Colorado near Madison. The switch is supposed to be
automatic, as you know, but sometimes it would stick and I had
to get off my car and pry it open with a rod. I did this just as
I have done hundreds of times before and noticed that the
rails were slippery, so slippery that brakes were almost use
less.
"I suppose I should have looked around, but when you do
the same thing hundreds of times without incident, you come
to take it all for granted. I was humming a little tune to myself
and did not see the car coming up slowly to the rear of mine.
The motorman applied the brakes, but the car did not stop;
it simply slid into mine.
"I was pinned to the track by the wheels as they passed over
my legs and severed them. I thought of you, both of you,
dear girls, as I realized this must be the end. I never thought
it would come like that. Jim, the motorman of the car which
ran into mine, rushed to my side sobbing like a kid. Don't ever
blame him; it was my time to go, that is all. You think I suf
fered, but truly I felt no pain, not during the whole time I
lay there waiting for the wrecking crew to come. I gave some
messages for both of you and tried to be cheerful. I thought
of all the joys and sorrows we had lived together, so bravely
and hopefully, while all the time above me was that mass of
steel holding me to the pavement.
Spiritual Wealth 163
<-
"Things only seem terrible, my dears, but they are not. God
is very good. When the pain finally came, on the way to the
hospital, I quit my earthly body. I lost my earthly habitation,
but found a new temple in a far fairer land. It was a shock
to me, as it was to you, but all my life I have done what I be
lieved to be right. I had tried to live honestly and found that
I had with me the only wealth which could be brought to
this side of life.
"Everyone was so kind and good to me. They helped me
and I seemed to learn so easily. Very soon I found out that
we can communicate with you who are left behind on earth,
through the power of those whom you call mediums. They are
as lighthouses to us, showing us the way to reach our loved
ones on earth.
"I started in right away to put you in touch with somebody
who would send you to a medium, and I succeeded, didn't I?
Only two days ago you heard of Mrs. Cook. Isn't that right?"
Both young women were sobbing, but there was a new note
of bravery in the voice of his Mary as she realized that this
one she loved so much was not lost to her, but merely had
preceded her a little way in a land where all is brightness and
happiness for those who have truly, nobly tried on earth.
"But, Peter, we want you so."
"Listen to me, dearest," Peter answered, and I could see
the light of love and triumph in his eyes, the happiness that
comes to those who find there is no death, no grave, nor need
be even a barrier if the gates are left ajar by love.
"I left four thousand dollars in life insurance which you
have. The Maccabees are to pay you two thousand more in a
164 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>.>>>>>>>>.> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>>>>
few days. That makes six thousand all together. I am right,
am I not?"
"Yes, Peter dear, that is correct," sobbed Mary.
"I will see that both of you get along all right. We can do
so many wonderful things here, never getting tired, always
receiving power to help others. I will do endless things for
both of you.
"I must go now, because other loved ones are just as anxious
as I am to speak to their dear ones who are gathered here
with you."
After a brief pause Peter spoke hurriedly and with new
fervor.
"I will be with you every step of the way home, just as I
came with you; just as I brought you here. Now, good-by, and
God bless both of you for coming."
Peter was gone from the circle in which he could material
ize his voice, but he stood between his wife and sister and in
his powerful spiritual way comforted them and helped them
to catch some of the glory of the other wonderful messages
that came through.
If more people would come as humbly, and with love, as
Mary and Emma came, demanding nothing, hoping and pray
ing, placing their trust in God, more indeed would receive
what Mary and Emma received.
If more people would devote a larger portion of their time
and efforts to helping others and conducting their own affairs
with justice, honesty, and love, and less time to personal ag
grandizement, they would find that they would receive
greater and more permanent rewards in the end and would

have great spiritual power, as Peter had, to help their loved
ones. Worldly pomp, power, and money are left behind with
the earthly body; only love and spiritual development may
be taken to the Other Side.

MATERIAL WEALTH
AQUESTION VERY FREQUENTLY RAISED BY A PERSON UN-
acquainted with Spiritualism when talking to a Spiritual
ist is: "If, as you say, your Spirit friends are so much more
highly developed and wiser than we on this earth, why do they
not make you rich? Surely they could tell you how to get
money easily and quickly."
This question really is of considerable interest to all of us
who are not supplied over-generously with this world's goods
and I will give a rather detailed account of several cases which
illustrate different aspects of the answer. The real answer to
this takes into consideration several facts. In the first place
the question tacitly assumes that the acquisition of money is
the most desirable thing in the world and best for the individ
ual. In the second place no account is taken of the efforts put
forth by the person to earn the money. In the third place it
is rather evident that it is not intended that everyone be rich,
and it may be this particular being's present experience to be
poor. In the fourth place the person may deliberately turn
down opportunities which are presented to him, or, in the
fifth place, so dissipate his energies and what money he has
167
1 68 The Voice Triumphant
>■»»»-> > >.».>.>» >>>>>>>>>>>>>> >.»»»».>>» > > >
on foolish ventures that his Spirit friends are occupied entirely
with keeping him from complete disaster.
Let us first describe the case of a man who turned down op
portunities presented to him by his Spirit friends. He had been
coming to the Stead Center for several years, his wife, chil
dren, and a number of relatives with him, all professing ab
solute faith in their Guides. He was a very good friend of
mine, a substantial business man, operating an electrical goods
store and electrical contracting business. His interest in his
spiritual development was such as to induce him to join our
oriental class to receive the spiritual teachings of our higher
Guides. He assumed the duties of one of the officers of the
Center.
One day at a private sitting he told my Guide Pat that he
knew of a lot he could get for eighteen hundred dollars and
he wished advice. This was at the time of increasing rents and
prices during the war and he was considering the purchase of
a lot and the erection of a store of his own on it. After investi
gation Pat told him by all means to buy the lot immediately,
even if he did not build on
it,
because the lot was
a
very valu
able one. For some reason he procrastinated until the lot was
purchased
by
someone else. Two years later this purchaser sold
it
for twenty-five thousand dollars.
It
would seem that one experience of this kind should be
enough. If we do not grasp each opportunity that comes, they
usually cease coming. This man, however, was fortunate. He
again came across
a
piece of property, improved with
a
build
ing containing stores, with apartments above them, which the
Material Wealth 169
<
owner, facing foreclosure of a mortgage, was willing to sell
for twelve thousand dollars. Again Pat's advice was to pur
chase immediately and he was reminded of the previous op
portunity which he had allowed to slip by. Fear of the debt he
would have to incur and possibly some other reasons of his
own induced him again to disregard the advice he had asked
for. Two years later this property sold for seventy thousand
dollars. These two deals alone would have netted this man
about eighty thousand dollars on an original investment of
eighteen hundred dollars, all in about four years' time. If
he had accepted the advice given him, no doubt other oppor
tunities would have presented themselves to him.
I do not think that our Guides can be accused justly of not
trying to add to our material welfare. What has been the re
sult to this man of neglecting two such opportunities? Up to
the present he has had no others, still is making a comfortable
living from his business, but has not the worry-relieving fact
of eighty thousand dollars behind him.
The following case illustrates the dissipation of energy and
money on unwise ventures, and also the fact that it evidently
was not intended that this man should accumulate wealth.
Coming of poor parents, the boy found it necessary very early
in life to go to work to help support the family. By the time
he was twenty, he was practically the sole provider, his father
finding much difficulty in obtaining steady employment at his
trade. The boy was successful in each position he held, resign
ing for a better one each time. Gradually he invested small
sums in Chicago real estate and made extra money. Finally
170 The Voice Triumphant
»»■»■>■»■>■>->■>■> >>>>>>>>> »■>■>» >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
he went into business for himself when about thirty-two years
old. His business prospered, but as he obtained money, he in
vested it in real estate, in gold mines, in oil wells, and other
ventures without maintaining sufficient liquid capital to carry
his business over any ordinary difficulty. The result was that a
fire which destroyed his factory embarrassed him so financially
that he lost his home and several other pieces of property.
His investments in mines and wells never were any good, and
all such money was lost. Nevertheless his company brought
him a fairly good income, gradually decreasing, it is true, be
cause of the character of his product, the sale of which de
pended on style in architecture to a great extent. After a few
quiet years during which he had little money for any sort of
investment, he became acquainted with me and my work as
a medium. He sought advice and help from his Guides and
used both. Finally the war came on, and while his business
difficulties multiplied in many ways, by accepting the advice of
his Spirit friends he was able to solve them and, by obtaining
government contracts, to make an excellent showing in the
business. Soon many old financial obligations were settled
and money accumulated. His son had finished his college
course and now contributed to the family income.
It would seem that, bearing in mind all the past mistakes
and experiences in investing money foolishly, this man, now
about sixty-five years old, would be extremely careful what
he did with his resources when he was practically in a posi
tion where he could retire. But was he? First, a high-pressure
salesman induced him to take on a large amount of suburban
Chicago real estate, unimproved in any way. His Guides were
Material Wealth 171
< <<
not consulted about this venture until it was finished. Against
their advice he turned down an offer to sell his factory for a
good sum. He purchased a small retail candy-shop without
consulting his Guides until the deal was almost closed and
the price agreed on. He was told that he was paying far more
than the business was worth, but that if he operated it care
fully and put no more money in it until it was showing him a
profit, he probably could make a success of it. As soon as the
purchase was completed, he had the shop remodeled with new
fixtures ; he could not operate it very carefully because of his
other business and lack of knowledge of this one. The result
was that it showed a loss from the start and finally had to be
given up, all the money invested being a total loss.
Soon after this his factory burned down again, and with lit
tle cash on hand he had to sell the property at a very low figure
and start manufacturing again in a rented building. Meantime
the depression due to deflation after the war had set in and his
business barely brought him a living. He could not meet the
obligations on the suburban property he had contracted for
and in the readjustment lost the most valuable of the lots and
had to turn in the only other piece of real estate he still owned
free and clear. When he passed over to the Spirit World a year
or two ago, he left his widow a few shares of stock which
brought in a steady although very small income, and several
suburban lots which are being assessed continually for street-
paving, sewers, sidewalks, etc.—a continual expense merely
to prevent their loss.
It will be seen that this man's Guides were so occupied try
ing to get him out of the troubles he continually created for
172 The Voice Triumphant
>>>»>»>>».>.>■>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
himself that they had little time to create opportunities for
him. When they did once have him in a position where the
way appeared clear and some careful investments would have
brought him independence for his few remaining years, he
undid all their work by his own unwise procedure. During the
time when he was asking and accepting their advice in small
matters, he had ample proof of their help and often said he
could not see why other people acted contrary to the advice
given by their Guides.
It would seem too that it was intended that this man be poor.
He worked incessantly, surmounted difficulties in the conduct
of his business that would have closed most in similar circum
stances, earned hundreds of thousands of dollars, never spent
anything in riotous living, and was a model citizen, always
trying to help his community. Yet he passed over a compara
tively poor man. Most people would say, and he himself be
lieved, that hard luck followed him all his life, but a careful
examination of his case will show that his own course of ac
tion proved his undoing. In his early life careful conserva
tion of his money would have prevented the first fire, causing
the loss of practically everything he had. A small amount of
cash to use then would have meant that what the fire destroyed
physically would be the total of his loss. In his later life,
even without the advice of his Guides, a similar small amount
of cash on hand would have prevented the disasters following
the second fire.
These two cases show rather clearly why our Spirit
friends cannot necessarily make us rich in this world's
goods.
Material Wealth 173
■<
Another aspect of the answer to the question stated at the
beginning of the chapter needs consideration. If we do not put
forth the proper effort, our Guides cannot bring us material
blessings. Most of us are acquainted with the good souls who
say: "When my ship comes in, 1 will do thus and so," and
then lie back in their rocking-chairs and wait for the ship. The
chances are that if their ship docked a block away from their
rocking-chair, they would not know it. Do they ever think
that even a row-boat in order to "come in" must have someone
pulling manfully at the oars? Does not someone first have
to strain at the oars to take the boat away to be loaded with
the blessings that are expected to return? How many liners
such as the Leviathan and the Europa would come to port if
many, many men did not spend their lives and energies plan
ning them, financing them, building them, loading them with
their cargoes, and piloting them through storms and dangers?
All this work must be done conscientiously and well before it
can be hoped the ship will come in carrying its cargo of bless
ings. We can sit in our rocking-chairs or go about our narrow
circle of humdrum duties until Gabriel blows his trumpet for
us to start climbing the stairs to heaven without having our
ship come in if we do not build the boat and then operate and
care for it faithfully. In fact, I think many of these good folk
in this modern day will expect Gabriel or possibly St. Peter
to provide them with an elevator so they will not have to
walk up the stairs to heaven.
If we make the start and work hard with love in our hearts,
we are going to have a return. We may be unable to keep the
return, as was the man mentioned before, but it comes to us
174 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>.»>>>>»»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
just the same. If we do not make the start and do not work
faithfully and cheerfully, we cannot expect our Guides to be
able to bring us any blessings. Loving labor creates its own
reward. If we have not created the reward, nothing can bring
it to us.
The last aspect of the answer to our question: the assump
tion that the acquisition of money is the most desirable thing
in the world for the greatest good of the individual, has been
answered in the negative for ages by the best minds. I cannot
improve upon what they have said, but merely will point out
that laboring to get money for its own sake is almost certain
to cause a person to neglect and stunt his spiritual growth.
Money cannot be taken away to the other side of life, but
spiritual growth can. Therefore it should be evident which is
the more important. If we should remain comparatively poor,
and none of the other conditions mentioned before are opera
tive in our case, we probably will find upon careful analysis
of ourselves that our Guides have brought us great spiritual
development. It also has been my observation that a person
who has acquired real spiritual development never suffers for
lack of worldly goods. He may not have an over-abundance,
but he always will have enough to suffice for his needs.

THE GREATER LOVE
Hear Thou my prayer, great God of opulence:
Give me no blessings, save as recompense,
For blessings which I lovingly bestow
On needy stranger or on suffering foe.
If wealth, by chance, should on my path appear,
Let Wisdom and Benevolence stand near,
And Charity within my portal wait,
To guard me from acquaintance intimate.
Yet in this intricate great art of living,
Guide me away from misdirected giving,
And show me how to spur the laggard soul
To strive alone once more to gain the goal.
Repay my worldly efforts to attain
Only as I develop heart and brain;
Nor brand me with the "dollar sign" above
A bosom void of sympathy and love.
If on the carrying winds my name be blown
To any land or time beyond my own,
Let it not be as one who gained the day
By crowding others from the chosen way.

INGRATITUDE
APERSON WHO HAS READ CAREFULLY WHAT HAS GONE BE-
fore might with justice ask another question: "Surely
none of the arguments developed about 'material wealth'
apply to a medium, unless possibly it is that Fate wills her to
be poor. Why do not her Guides bring her a great deal of
money when they know she would spend it wisely and in
helping whomever she could?" It may be that God intends a
medium to remain comparatively poor, possibly in order to
insure the humbleness which is necessary for her work and
personal development. Whatever the reason
is,
it
appears
that she receives no adequate monetary return for her services.
For help which could be obtained in no other earthly way she
will not receive even the fee of
a
mediocre lawyer. She never
receives the tithe demanded
by
the well-organized church. She
is
not able to build
a
magnificent cathedral as
a
home for her
religion. People of wealth are very willing to avail themselves
of her services when
in
trouble, but are not willing to con
tribute financially to her support or to her cause
in
order that
similar help may be brought to many others. Even for Spirit
ual blessings money
is
necessary to make available to the many
the benefits which are enjoyed
by
a
few who are fortunate
177
178 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>
enough to understand what a medium is and know that they
live near one. With adequate financial assistance she could es
tablish centers from which this help could be obtained by any
who wished it and could let the people know what this help
is and where it could be found. Spiritualism is a religion of the
heart and of the home and never has been organized on the
business basis of other religions, but the superior consolation
and satisfaction it offers could be brought to the multitude by
proper monetary support.
Mediums sacrifice their meager resources to help everyone
they are able because they believe in giving assistance to oth
ers, but they have been sadly limited by their own scanty sup
ply. Why they have so little will appear from the following
cases which I have selected from many similar ones.
Soon after I had started public work I was visited by a
woman who had lost her only child, a young man of twenty-
one years. At her first visit her son gave her such proof of
his identity that he assuaged her grief, which really was in
tense, and convinced her of his actuality in Spirit. She then
told me that a man originally had made the appointment with
me for her, and that she had canceled
it,
thinking he might
have given some information to me about her. This indicated
the woman's very suspicious nature.
She returned each week for
a
visit with her loved ones and
after some time one day told me her name.
It
meant nothing
one way or the other to me, although she seemed to think she
was conferring quite
a
favor in telling me.
I
decided
I
would
try once and for all to remove any suspicion from her mind
Ingratitude 179
<. <-«. < <««« <-«. < <««« < <««« <«««
as to the truth of her Spirit friends' communicating with her.
I suggested that I would hold a seance in her own home to
show her there was no trickery. She was delighted and we ar
ranged the details. After the first seance she asked me to hold
several others, but never offered me any recompense for my I
time, although her home showed she was a woman with con
siderable means.
One day she came to me bringing a sister with her who
proved a very fine character and an old Spiritualist. For the
next two years the sisters came regularly, sometimes together,
usually on alternate weeks.
One week neither appeared. For three weeks I heard noth
ing from them. Finally the woman who had visited me first
called me up and asked me if I had missed them. I replied
that I had and hoped no one had been ill. She said she felt
fine, and her sister was all right. She arranged for a sitting.
When she arrived, I happened to be looking out my window.
I saw her get out of her limousine followed by her sister. This
seemed rather unusual, as they generally did not come to
gether. They came into the room, and it was only as I was
about to greet the sister that I saw she had disappeared and the
woman was standing alone. Asking her where her sister was,
she said that she had come alone today.
I told her that I had seen the two of them get out of the
car together, but she only laughed in a peculiar manner and
said I must be mistaken.
We entered the seance room, and the first one to come was
the sister. She said: "Will you never be convinced? Why didn't
you tell the medium I passed away two weeks ago?"
180 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> »»>.»»>.»»»
The woman had no explanation. She "wanted to see if her
sister would come to her! "
Her sister then told her she had left a will and she wanted
everything done exactly as the will said. She made her promise
to be strong and carry out the provisions, no matter what came
up. Of course I understood nothing of this, but at each subse
quent sitting the sister in Spirit said the same thing.
Five weeks later, one Saturday morning, I found out what
was meant. Three men came to my door and, after ascertaining
who I was, showed me a picture which I instantly recognized
as that of the lady who had just passed over. They asked me
if I had ever met this woman and I said I had.
They asked me if I didn't think she was not entirely men
tally responsible.
I became indignant immediately, as she was a fine character
and most clear thinker. I told them so in no uncertain terms.
Then one of the men said sneeringly: "She must have been
crazy to come to talk to spirits."
This made me angry and I invited them to leave.
Then the man who had not yet spoken said: "We shall get
nowhere this way."
He explained that he was a lawyer and represented the two
men with him, who were cousins of the woman and who had
been left out of the will. What they wished to do was to prove
the woman mentally irresponsible, and if I would testify to
that effect, they would give me ten thousand dollars. The
man showed me the money and said it was mine if I would
give my promise.
If I had been strong enough, I should have thrown them
Ingratitude 1 8 1
■<.
out. As it was, I only could tell them what I thought of
them.
As soon as they were gone, I telephoned the woman to come
to see me immediately. She protested, saying she had tickets
to a matinee and did not want to miss it. I told her to come
over, as I had something much more important for her than
any matinee. With reluctance she came. I told her all that
had occurred.
When I had finished, she said: "Well, what are you going
to do? Ten thousand dollars is a lot of money."
I was so indignant at such an implication that I almost told
her I would have nothing further to do with her, but, being
young and strongly imbued with the idea that I must help
everyone in trouble whom I could help, I told her what I
thought of her for assuming I could be so mercenary as to do
such a thing, and then took her into the seance room.
Her sister came and said: "Now you know what I have been
warning you about. You are going to have a hard fight, but
if you will do as I say, you will win."
For four years this case was fought out in the courts. The
woman came to see me regularly all this time and to receive
the advice of her sister on each point as it arose. In the end
she won the case, received the one million dollars her sister
had willed her, and as a reward to me for all these years of
indispensable service sent me a ten-dollar cut-glass vase.
She had not even the gratefulness in her heart to offer me
what I had declined from her relatives to perjure myself. This
case illustrates one reason why a medium is not wealthy. If
she demanded certain sums for her services, she probably
1 82 The Voice Triumphant
>.>>>>>> »>.»»>.> >>>>>>>>■>>>>>>> »>.».».>» > > > ».
would get them, but when she leaves it to certain persons'
grateful hearts, she can starve.
Somewhat similar to this is another case, the principal differ
ence lying in the fact that nothing would have been known
about the bequest had it not been for my Guides. Some friends
made an appointment for a woman one day, and when she
appeared, I found they had told her what to expect, although
she never had been to a medium before. She was a widow,
very poor and living on charity. (All this I found out later
as her Spirit friends talked to her.)
She had been in the room a few minutes when a voice spoke
and said: "Hello, Emma."
She was greatly surprised and said: "Who is this? It sounds
like my father's voice, but he would not speak to me, because
he was angry with me when he died."
"It is your father," he replied. After giving his name in full,
he continued: "I am very glad you came here. For ten years
I have been trying to get you to come. You know that I have
been in Spirit for twenty years and that when you married
against my wishes, I told you I would disinherit you. I let you
believe this, but I did not do it. I established an estate for you
and made the Bank of — executors of that estate. Now, in
order to get this money you will have to have a lawyer and
I want you to go to — and tell him your story."
She was so surprised that she wept and said that she could
not believe her angry father could have left her anything.
I told her she must investigate and go to see the lawyer whom
her father had told her to see.
Ingratitude 183
■<.
When she told her story to this man, he thought she was
crazy, but, having reached the age and position in his profes
sion where the unusual offered great attraction, he undertook
to conduct the investigation. He found that an estate of one
hundred thousand dollars was standing in this woman's name
in the bank her father had named to her. The estate was left
in a peculiar manner, one of the provisions being that it must
be claimed in twenty-three years. Twenty years already had
passed before she heard of it. It took five years to straighten
out all the difficulties and meet all the conditions. During the
whole time she was guided by her father step by step, and
because she had no money, I gave my time and strength freely
with no recompense.
Finally she got the money and promptly forgot there was
such a thing as a Stead Center in existence or a faithful friend
named Mrs. Cook. This time I did not receive even a cut-glass
vase. For five years of labor in her behalf I received not one
cent. The lawyer's bill was paid; it had to be. I presented no
bill. I think the conclusion is rather obvious.
As a sequel and possibly a lesson from God to those who
knew the circumstances, this woman enjoyed her money only
a year before she passed to the Other Side. She has come to me
many times since and told me that she regretted not having
compensated me for my time and effort in her behalf.
At one time the wife of one of the wealthiest men in Chicago
came to me regularly for sittings and also had me come to her
home to hold them. Most of the people she invited came from
curiosity only and made my work doubly difficult. In the
184 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>>>»■>■>»>>»>>>>>>»>>>>>>>>»
course of time her husband passed over, and upon settling
the estate no trace of a million dollars' worth of stock certifi
cates could be found. These certificates were her personal prop
erty, but she had loaned them to him to use as collateral at a
time when he needed them. From all records of the estate
this collateral had been returned to him, but the certificates
could not be found.
About a month after his passing I had a very vivid vision in
which the man came to me and said: "Hurry and get dressed.
We will go to Ella [his wife] and take her with us. We must
go to the bank to get the stock."
I seemed to follow him to a certain bank on La Salle Street
into which he went and up to a small room where there was a
little safe. He showed me the dial and pointed out what num
bers would work the combination. Then I awoke, and the
vision was so vivid that I drew a circle and put in it the num
bers he had shown me. This was about four o'clock in the
morning.
I went to bed again and upon falling asleep had the same
experience again. He urged me most earnestly not to forget,
but to follow the vision exactly.
At nine o'clock I telephoned his wife and told her my ex
perience. She said that he never had any dealings with that
bank as far as she knew, but she would go with me. She wished
to take her son along. After hearing our reason for wishing to
make the trip he laughed and said it was all foolishness, his
father never had anything to do with that particular bank,
and he himself did not want to waste his time in any wild-
goose chase. I assured them my vision meant something and
Ingratitude 185
< <<
for their own good they should go.
Finally he consented and we went to the bank. "Yes," said
the man in charge, "Mr. — kept a small safe here."
I told him I knew it and could open the safe if he would
take us to it because Mr. — had shown me the combination.
He said that was very fortunate, because the combination was
not known to them. He led us to the safe I had seen in my
dream, and, remembering the numbers I had been shown,
I opened it. The only thing in it was an envelope containing
the million dollars' worth of certificates they had been unable
to find.
My only pay was: "Isn't Medie wonderful?"
If some kind philosopher, or any helpful individual for
that matter, will show me how to cash "Thank you's" and
"Aren't you wonderful ?'s" I feel sure I should be the richest
woman in the world and would gladly give him half of the
wealth for his work and not a "Thank you" which he would
have to turn into cash! Pleasant as it is to be thanked and
complimented, I have yet to find a grocery-store where they
will give me a jar of jam for one of my "Thank you's."
Two more incidents of gross selfishness and ingratitude I
will mention briefly and leave this profitless subject. The
owner of an electrical manufacturing business came to me for
the first time, without money, and with some seventy-five
thousand dollars' debt. Careful adherence to the advice of his
Guides, combined with their assistance when making competi
tive bids on contracts, not only put his business on a going
basis, but brought him a fortune of a million dollars, all in a
1 86 The Voice Triumphant
»>>.>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
few years' time. Then, not only did he refuse to recognize
the Center, but he even denied he believed in Spiritualism.
Another man came to me in such bad health that the doctors
he had gone to had all given him up and told him he had
a very short time to live. He begged his Guides to give him
health long enough to accomplish certain things he wished
to do before he passed. They assisted him to retrieve a fortune
and accomplish his wishes. They restored his health so well
that he divorced his wife, married a young girl, and willed
her all his property. Having everything he wanted, he
promptly forgot there was such a place as the Stead Center or
that it had ever done anything for him.
I think I have said enough to show quite clearly why medi
ums do not become wealthy and are not able to build the
great churches that other religious leaders can build. We spend
our time and energy helping other people, but never are given
part of the wealth our work creates. If we devoted the same
time and effort toward enriching ourselves, we undoubtedly
should succeed as well as we now do for others, but something
in a medium's mental make-up or her destiny prevents her
from doing this ; I know from my own experience that the
study of business and making money does not offer one-tenth
the interest that some human being perplexed with a sorrow
ful problem does. I will devote hours and days to bringing
happiness to such a person by assisting in solving his problem
and yet cannot give a small fraction of that time or thought
to helping myself. I have come to the conclusion that God
has planned for man to take care of His mediums in return
Ingratitude 187
<
for the help and happiness they give, and therefore has not
made provision for the mediums working for themselves.
When they do so, from force of necessity to eat and live, they
are much less efficient than when doing their proper work of
helping others. It is the old question of a square peg in a
round hole; the hole is filled very inadequately. Each person
can perform best that work for which he is intended and a
medium is not put on earth to make money for herself. Man's
own selfish interests, if nothing else, should induce him to
provide in such a way for a medium that she could devote all
her energy to doing her proper work, because in this way she
in turn would do much more for man than she can when part
of her strength goes toward fighting for her very food against
conditions so out of harmony with her vibrations. The ques
tion so often heard: "Why are there so few really good medi
ums?" would cease to be asked if mediums were properly
taken care of by those whom they help. Not only would many
mediocre mediums become good ones if relieved of the bur
den of providing for their material welfare, but God would
see that man had as many as he needed. When man refuses
to take proper care even of the few he has, he cannot expect
to be given more. If a visitor takes a beautiful cut-glass vase
and dashes it to pieces on the floor, he cannot expect his host to
hand him another and say: "Do likewise with this."

DECEPTION
OOME PEOPLE MAKE THEIR APPROACH TO SPIRITUALISM IN A
£5very peculiar manner. They are curious about the subject,
they may be very much interested in it. Some are in deep dis
tress and realize it offers, probably, the only solution to their
difficulty. Yet by some mental quirk they believe they must
conceal their identity or even disguise themselves. If they
approached a strange physician when ill or a strange lawyer
when in trouble, it would not occur to them to conceal essen
tial facts about their trouble. They place practically implicit
faith in either, although one may be a quack and the other a
crook. The ratio of charlatans in either profession to the hon
est upright members is just as high as that of fake mediums to
the honest ones. If they really considered the matter very care
fully, they would realize that a dishonest medium really
could do them less harm than either of the other gentlemen.
A quack, or even an honest but ignorant doctor, by a slight
mistake in selecting the proper medicine could kill their bodies.
If they are involved in legal difficulties, it could be quite easy
for an unscrupulous lawyer to acquire most if not all of their
money. A medium, even if dishonest, could cause them no
physical suffering, because they accept nothing material from
189
190 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> »».»->.>.>.>.>.».>.».>.» >
the medium. Neither could the medium take away their
money or property, because she asks them to sign nothing.
They must furnish their lawyer with their signature on many
documents whose contents they do not understand. Considered
from this point of view, what have people to fear when visit
ing a medium? Most other contacts they make in a business
way have a greater real basis of danger to their well-being
than any possible contact with a medium. Yet to show the
length to which people will go in attempting to fool a medium
or the Spirit World let me give an account of the following
cases.
One afternoon some years ago in Chicago a woman visited
me very elaborately togged out in a red velvet dress and a
bright-colored hat. She told me she never had been to a
medium before, but that a friend had spoken to her about me
and she had come for a visit. She seemed to me to be some
what nervous, so I suggested that instead of having a voice
seance in the dark, we have a trance reading in the light.
We no sooner had seated ourselves in the seance room than
I saw a distinguished-looking man build up behind her. He
wore a beard and was accompanied by a young woman and a
young man of about twenty-eight and twenty-nine years of
age, although I could tell that both had passed over when
children. The man told me to tell the woman he was Uncle
Doc and wanted to know why she came dressed as she was.
He said she looked terrible.
She denied knowing any of the three.
My Guides then told me they could do nothing for her.
Deception 191
< <. <<. <<
She had not come with the proper conditions, but had tried
to disguise herself and would not acknowledge the Spirit
friends who came to her. I merely told her that my Guides
could not help her because she had not brought proper con
ditions to the seance room.
She protested, but finally went home. I thought no more
about the incident.
Four days later the woman came to me dressed in mourn
ing. I had no recollection of having seen her before, and after
greeting her I told her she should not visit a medium dressed
in mourning because the natural conclusion would be that she
had just lost a relative or dear friend.
She said that it was all right, she had lost a relative and did
not care if I did know it from her appearance.
We went up to the seance room and immediately the form
of a man built up behind her who told me he was Uncle Doc.
He was accompanied by the same two young people I had seen
before. Then I realized this must be the same woman who had
come several days ago in a red dress. I told her what I saw and
asked her if she was the same woman.
She said she was.
The man then told me to tell her that she must recognize
him and the children before he could bring the one with whom
she really wished to talk. She broke down and cried and said
that after she had returned home the other day, she remem
bered who Uncle Doc was and the children. They were her
own children, but had passed in infancy, and her grief over a
loved one's recent passing had been so intense that she had
not remembered any of the three. She explained that this
192 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> »>»»»>»»»vv>-»-yyy>
man had not been a physician in this world, but had been
nicknamed Uncle Doc by the family and especially by the
children because of his expertness about a sick-room and his
ever present cheerfulness.
He asked me to tell her that she could not fool the Spirit
World, but by trying to do so she built a barrier about herself
that made it impossible for them to do anything for her. I
explained this the best I could and found she was a very in
telligent woman. Her husband, the loved one who had just
passed away, was a prominent attorney in the city and, after
she realized with what conditions she must come to a seance,
gave her many wonderful messages and great help.
Another case where deception was attempted occurred some
time ago and involved a minister of the gospel. From any
point of view it seems surprising that a minister should in
any undertaking practice deception, but here are the facts.
One Sunday evening in 19 16, with quite a number of peo
ple already gathered for the evening seance, a gentleman,
two ladies, and a little girl, all of whom were unknown to me,
appeared at the door. After a few words with them, which
assured me they were intelligent and refined people, I invited
them in.
The seance had no sooner started than my Guide Snowdrop
greeted the gentleman with: "Hello, Jack, I am glad to see
you here."
> He thanked her courteously.
She then greeted the little girl, asking her who she was.
Without waiting for a reply Snowdrop again addressed the
Deception 193
«««««.<.
man and told him to watch his child very closely and to guard
her very carefully because the Spirit World saw a cloud about
the child. What danger the cloud was an indication of they
could not tell, but a very definite danger threatened her and
would manifest itself within a few years.
After the seance had continued for some time, Pat came in
and in his usual frank manner said: "I have my own opinion
about people who preach the word of God and then come to
our medium after parking their dirty little old Ford in an al
ley several blocks away so that nobody could see it. Why don't
you clean the car up, at least? Then it would be respectable
enough to park on a street."
Not a word came from anyone, and as several strangers
were present, I could not tell to whom Pat was addressing
his remarks. A little later he also warned the little group
about the danger threatening the child and advised them to
watch her very carefully. When the seance came to an end,
everyone departed and I did not know yet to whom Pat re
ferred, but his words remained in my memory because I knew
he never spoke at random.
Eight years later while I was spending the summer on Cape
Cod, a car drove up one day and two couples got out. One man
and woman seemed to know me, but I had no recollection of
ever having seen any of them before. The gentleman said:
"Mrs. Cook, I do not suppose you remember me, but eight
years ago I attended one of your seances in Chicago."
He went on to explain how they had driven from their
home in Vermont one summer and had come to my seance
and had had such wonderful messages that they never had
194 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>
forgotten them, and when they heard by chance that I was in
Massachusetts, they drove down to see me.
I thanked him, but told him I could not remember him.
Then he said: "I think you will when I tell you what Pat
said to me about parking my dirty little Ford in an alley."
Instantly I remembered him and to verify for myself the
other part of the message asked him if he was a minister.
He said he was.
Not seeing the little girl with them, I asked where she was.
Very sadly he explained to me that two years ago (that
is,
six years after the warning given them
by
the Spirit World)
the little girl had been burned to death. They had watched
her unusually carefully all this time, but in some way the ac
cident happened. Pat's remarks had so impressed them with
their absolute truthfulness that they had decided then to take
Snowdrop's warning literally, although they never had be
lieved
in
Spiritualism before. Each summer now they come to
visit me and have had wonderful sittings.
The deception usually
is
not planned as elaborately as in
the two cases just cited. Usually the person misconstrues pur
posely the first attempts of his loved ones to deliver their mes
sages. Such
a
man once came to my home, and his doubt was
so pronounced that
I
at first refused even to make an assay
at
a
seance, but he pleaded so hard that he needed word from
his loved ones that
I
allowed myself to be persuaded and we
entered the seance room. Soon an indistinct whisper came
through the trumpet.
"Who
is
this? Who? Oh,
is
this Henry?"
Deception 195
<
Through the trumpet came an indistinct: "Henry." The
man chuckled softly to himself.
"My dear sir," I said to him, "you probably would go out
of here saying this dear one claimed to be Henry, whereas
you know no Henry on the Other Side. You have purposely
or ignorantly so disturbed the vibrations that you cannot get
a distinct message. I will tell you what this dear friend of yours
replied. He said: 'I know no Henry.' He tells me that his
name is Thomas, that he is your father, and that he passed
over in a railroad accident over thirty years ago."
"Great Cxsar!" exclaimed the man; "I thought your spirits
would try to fool me, so I intended to fool them first."
"You are fooling no one but yourself. Instead of getting a
beautiful message and one which you claimed you need, you
are fooling yourself out of it. If you sincerely desire to attract
your dear friends and the help they can bring you, you first
must come in love, bringing truth with you. In no other way
can you attract blessings or deserve them."
In connection with deception I should like to relate a little
story of a visit I once made when young to a church social as
the guest of one of the congregation. I did not know it at the
time, but my hostess had brought me to show the rest of the
members that I did not look like any of those people who are
pictured riding on broomsticks. That seemed to be their idea
of a medium and she wished to show them that the reality was
at least a trifle different.
When the young minister got up to give his customary talk,
he did his best to disparage me and my Truth. He said that
196 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>> »».> >»».».>.».» >>>>>> >>».>»»-> > >.».»
he could not believe that God would allow any of our friends
to come back, because He takes them for a much higher and
better work than they could do here. Then he told about a
lady who had lost two lovely children, a boy and a girl, when
they were about eighteen years old. Two years later she was
watching at the death-bed of another daughter, seventeen
years old, when suddenly the girl opened her eyes and said:
"Mother dear, I do not wish you to worry or grieve. I will
leave my earthly body at midnight, but brother and sister are
standing here at the bedside waiting to take me and help me."
As her daughter was speaking, the mother herself saw the
son and other daughter, who already had passed, dressed all
in white, looking beautiful and well. She said they looked just
as they had when in this world, but more lovely and she could
see how happy they were.
"Now," said the minister, "was that not a wonderful ex
perience for that poor mother to be shown that her daughter
would go to her brother's and sister's arms and be well and
happy with them?"
When he had finished speaking, I got up and said: "You
claim that you do not believe that our loved ones come back
to help us. What have you just told us if it is not that? Can
you explain to me what the difference is between your church
and mine if you believe this story?"
He became somewhat angry and replied: "I know this lady;
she is a member of my church and I know the story is true."
"I, too, know that it is true, but I cannot understand how
you can preach that our loved ones do not return to help us,
and still believe this story."
Deception 197
<. <<
This question still puzzles me. Most ministers with whom
I have come in contact have had experiences of this nature,
but they still will get up before their congregations and preach
that the "dead" do not return. They all teach that there is a
life after death and yet in spite of their own personal experi
ence to the contrary will deny that any communication can take
place between those living that other life and us on earth.
Some attempt to explain it by saying, as this young minister
did, that God has taken our friends for a higher and better
work than they could do here. Still they ignore their own ex
perience. I can come to no other conclusion than that this
should be considered deception, but why they should practice
it or what is gained by it I do not know, unless those ministers
think that their congregations do not wish to believe such ex
periences and would supplant them by other ministers who
would preach what they did wish to believe. The question is
an involved one, but it seems to me that people truly believ
ing in a future life would be very anxious to learn as much
about it as possible and would not be content to accept the
single picture of heaven or hell, fire, and brimstone presented
to them without trying to see if there were other pictures. All
of us would laugh pityingly at a man who would say: "Aero
planes do not exist because my father told me that people
can travel only on the ground or on water." He refuses to
recognize any mode of transportation other than the ones
described to him by a certain person. We should laugh at
him ; but are those people any more reasonable who will not
even investigate a different idea of their soul's future life than
the one described to them by a certain person, their minister?

MY PRECIOUS SECRET
I've a secret in my bosom
That the world can never know,
In each trial reassuring,
As the moments onward go.
Only those who do His will can its priceless
Value tell.
Round me sweep the waves of sorrow,
And their surgings press the soul.
With this secret still before me,
Tempests rise and billows roll.
Secret of undying love, lifts my heart to
Worlds above.
At our comrades' fading sunset,
When the spirits pass away,
But for this most precious secret,
Here my soul could scarcely stay.
In accents sweet I then can hear: "He thy mansion
Will prepare."
Fade life's transient dream of splendor,
Let my soul in Him confide,

SKEPTICISM
PRACTICALLY
EVERYONE — 1 MIGHT SAY EVERY PERSON —AT-
tending a seance for the first time is skeptical. This is not
at all surprising and is not an attitude to be censured. God
created us with minds of our own and intended that we should
use them whenever the necessity arose. To believe everything
someone tells us, without making any investigation of the mat
ter, is not using our minds as they should be used. Neither are
we employing them properly when we form firm opinions
and pass judgment upon things about which we know nothing.
I have shown many times that a questioning attitude with a
mind open to receive what may be presented will allow our
loved ones in Spirit to come to us and prove their identity.
Previous faith is not required ; questions asked with love suf
fice. What I wish to illustrate in this chapter is the skepticism
which no proof will remove, the unreasoning attitude which
denies everything.
Some people seem to understand and accept Spiritualism as
soon as they find out what it is. It is a part of themselves. Oth
ers accept it after a period of careful investigation and mental
uncertainty, after irrefutable proof has been given them. Still
others will accept it under no circumstances. They may be
201
202 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
curious about it and interested, but nothing is proof to them.
It has become very apparent to me that a person must be born
on a plane of sufficiently high spiritual development to be
able to understand and appreciate the beauties and comfort of
the religion. Others develop to this understanding through
their contact with it. The rest are on too material a plane to
comprehend its meaning. It is the last two of these classes
which I wish to illustrate here.
Soon after I began giving public seances a woman came one
night who among several others was a stranger to me. Not
understanding my gift very well as yet and how important
it was to those who were in need of messages from their loved
ones, I paid no particular attention to the people attending my
seances, although I did note that this woman came again the
following week.
Soon after the seance started, a voice came to her and said :
"I am your brother," and gave his name in full.
"My stars, are you dead?" she asked in astonishment.
This is all of the conversation I understood, because they
soon began to speak in Danish, the woman's native language.
After the seance was over, she explained to me that her brother,
after a quarrel with her some years before, had left and gone
to San Francisco and she had heard nothing from him until
this evening. He told her he had just passed away two days
before and had left instructions for his body to be shipped to
her. He said it already was on the train and would arrive the
following Friday at the depot. He told her he had left some
insurance made out to her and he wished her to use a little of
Skepticism 203
<, ««.<.««.<.
it for a very simple funeral, and the rest of the money to buy
a house.
Needless to say, the woman was completely bewildered. Re
turning home, she told her husband what had happened.
He merely laughed at her and said she was crazy.
Everything, however, turned out exactly as her brother had
told her—the body arrived at the time and place he said it
would, the insurance came, and then she asked her husband if
he believed in her Spirit friends.
He said that he did not.
Finally she brought him to several seances, but he was un
convinced. At the close of the fourth seance he attended, I said :
"Is there anything I can do to convince you of the truth of
communication with your Spirit friends?"
(This shows how young and ignorant I was at this time.
It is impossible to convince anyone of something he does not
wish to understand and has not development enough to com
prehend.)
The man said: "Yes"; if I would hold a seance at his home
and use a trumpet he would provide.
I agreed to do this.
When I arrived, I found a great cumbersome horn he evi
dently had made himself, so heavy I doubted that my Spirit
friends could use it. He asked me to go into a bedroom with
his wife and daughter, remove my clothes, and put on some
of his wife's. I did so, and when I came out, I looked a sight.
I was a slim young girl, and his wife a woman weighing about
two hundred pounds. Nevertheless I was willing to do any
thing to help people to an understanding of my beloved Spirit
204 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■>>■>>■»
friends. He asked me to sit next to him, which I did, in order
that he would know if I moved. The seance started and the
first thing to happen was for that heavy horn to come down
on his head with a bang. I was pleasantly surprised to find my
Guides could use the thing. He was surprised also, but not so
pleasantly. Then a voice said : "Charlie, I am your mother and
I am glad to speak to you."
The reply was something like this: "If you are my mother,
you can tell me my complete name, where I was born, and
how old I am."
(A beautiful welcome to give one's mother who came out of
love to greet her son.)
His mother said : "All right, I will tell you what you ask,
but you will not like it."
She gave his names, of which he had four, she told him
where he was born and gave his correct age. This last was the
thing she predicted he would not like. For twenty-five years
of married life he had posed to his wife as being five years
younger than he really was. He had forgotten this, and his
mother gave his correct age. At first he denied she was right,
then admitted she was.
His mother then told his wife to send to the town in Den
mark she had named as his birthplace and ask for a copy of
the birth certificate.
(This was done, and when it arrived, it proved his mother
was correct.)
After the seance was over, I asked him if he believed now.
He said: "I don't know."
He never attended another one of my seances ; I can assure
Skepticism 205
<
you of that.
Some years later he became very ill and after two years of
invalidism passed away. Meanwhile his wife came regularly
once a week to the Friday evening healing class for help for
him. He actually admitted receiving this help, saying he felt
something around him which seemed to keep away the pain,
but he did not know what it was. It became a habit to ask his
wife how he was getting along and I did this one Friday as
usual with the accustomed reply that he was getting along all
right. When the seance started, the first voice to come said:
"Well, Emma, I found the place and didn't need the card."
At first we did not understand; then we realized it was the
woman's husband. He had passed away the preceding Mon
day and his funeral was held Thursday. His last request to his
wife had been that she put my card under the pillow in his
casket without letting anyone know she had done it. He told
her he wanted to be sure his spirit would know the address so
he could come to talk to her at my seances. As a further test
for herself his wife had not even told any of us about his pass
ing, much less about the card, wishing to see if her husband
would come and tell her about it.
It is very evident that this man was a totally unreasonable
skeptic, but his wife, after coming to my seances regularly for
ten years and receiving test after test, felt she needed one
more. Was she not a greater skeptic?
Cases such as this almost have convinced me that tests are
not of much value when people really are not ready to receive
the truth. No matter what their Spirit friends give them, they
do not understand. They may think they do, but they miss the
206 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> »»»»■>»»»
essential point. If a person is ready, a single test frequently
convinces him and he sees the Truth and what avenues it opens
up before him to a better, more useful, and happier life.
Once a gentleman came to a seance of mine who accepted
nothing. He came again with the same result. After four or
five visits I told him it was useless for me to try to help him.
"I do not see why. I wish to believe and have heard so
much about you, Mrs. Cook, that I am sure you can bring me
in touch with my friends in Spirit."
"In your present state of mind I can do nothing for you.
You are so tight and unyielding when you enter the seance
room that every spiritual thought sent in your direction
bounces right back as though it were a rubber ball hitting a
stone wall. You must bring more into the seance room than
the wish to believe. You must bring a mind open to receive
whatever blessings your friends may have for you, not a
determination that such and such proof must be given you.
If you really are willing to make an effort to do what I say,
you may come again next week and we will make one more
attempt."
Trying his best to bring the proper conditions, he returned
the following week and the seance began.
"Cliff," the sound of his name spoken in a very low whis
per startled him, "Cliff, this is Aunt Tine."
"She is not dead," he replied.
"No, I am not dead, dear boy, but I passed over yesterday.
Call Nettie [his wife] and ask her."
She left, but Snowdrop explained: "This aunt lived in the
Skepticism 207
«.««««««««««.«.«««««««.«■«««
East and passed over yesterday. We will stop the seance now
and I want you to go to the telephone and call your wife. You
will find she has received a telegram telling her what we have
just told you."
He called his wife and found she had just received the mes
sage as Snowdrop had said.
At a later seance Snowdrop said: "Cliff, you must not quar
rel so with your wife. You must be more patient with her. Be
as good to her as you can, because she is not going to stay on
this earth much longer." Within two years cancer caused his
wife to pass over to the Other Side. Then he knew why she
was so irritable sometimes and seemed unreasonable.
This man had been going to mediums for years and never
received any better results during all this time than he did in
his first few seances with me. The very fact he was so per
sistent, however, indicated to me that the man probably
wanted to believe the Truth, but just did not know how to
bring the condition that would allow his friends and Guides
to prove their existence to him. With his unyielding attitude
it was impossible for them to get through to him with any
convincing message. After I had explained the matter to him,
he began to look at it from a different point of view, and this
was all that his Spirit friends needed to permit them to bring
him their proof. They always are most anxious to do this and
fail only when the mortal builds such an impregnable wall
mentally about himself that they cannot penetrate it.
Sometimes the Spirit friend finds it easier to give the proof
to me in the form of a mental picture, if I may call it such, to
208 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>>>>
be described to his loved one. This usually is done when the
passing over has occurred in a peculiar manner, a picture of
which is sufficient to establish his identity.
This happened to a woman who had had no previous ex
perience with a medium. She came unannounced, but, finding
she was refined and sincere, I took her to the seance room. Pos
sibly because she was a strict Methodist church-goer, her state
of mind was such that for perhaps ten minutes nothing came.
Then a picture began to take shape before me, a gruesome one.
I told her I was getting nervous, that I saw before me a two-
story frame house which then disappeared, the attic in this
same house coming into view. I saw a man kneeling on the
floor who had a rope around his neck.
"Wonderful!" exclaimed the woman; "my husband com
mitted suicide in our attic, and when I found him, he was on
his knees as you describe him."
Her husband then came and spoke to her, his identity thus
established without his saying a word. "It is too bad that we
have to bring you scenes of agony and suffering in order to
convince you. Mortals are so ignorant of spiritual truth that
we have to show you such things. God never punished me for
committing suicide. I had cancer and the agony was so ter
rible that I could not stand it."
Later her niece came. "I am here too, your little Toota."
She recognized this nickname, but asked Toota to show me
how her passing had occurred. I saw the niece standing in
front of the woman with a revolver in her hand and told her
what I saw.
"Yes, she shot herself three weeks ago."
Skepticism 209
<
This woman received many more tests during the next two
years in her sittings with me. Yet when a certain well-known
man—the agent who was to attempt to bring some disrepute,
by any means whatsoever, on Spiritualism because it was bring
ing freedom through truth and enlightenment too rapidly to
those whose ignorance was the foundation and power of a
large organization —began his machinations, this woman came
to me and asked me why I did not come out and wage combat
with him. "Surely, if this is the truth and our friends in Spirit
really communicate with us, you should not fear to tell him
he is wrong and can prove it to him.,?
Such was her line of reasoning, and, recognizing the type
of mind, I contented myself with telling her that she would
know very soon whether her friends communicated with her
or not and also why I did not fight with the man. "If after
all the tests you have received you still can have doubt in your
mind, nothing I can do will remove it," I told her.
She passed over to the Other Side six months later, then
came to me one night as I lay in bed and said that she now
understood and was very sorry for me when people doubted!
I knew at the time that it would have been useless to try
to explain to her that nothing can be proved to a person who
does not wish to believe. She would not have understood. This
man knew that the beliefs of Spiritualism were true; he knew
that those in Spirit could and did communicate with those on
earth. He had considerable mediumistic ability himself, and
a large part of his success in his business came from that fact.
I knew all this and knew too that when such a man chose to
give money and notoriety preference over his conscience and
210 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>-»
what he knew to be truth, no one could "convince" him of any
thing. He had all the facts and made his own decision. The
man who chooses to state that the earth is flat and to ignore
all established facts to the contrary will not accept any further
facts and be "convinced" it is globular.
Skepticism often is due to ignorance of facts and, when it
is,
cannot and should not be held to
a
person's discredit. After
receiving tests or proof beyond controversy
it
is
due either to
mental or spiritual deficiency or
a
purposeful disbelief, usually
with money at the bottom of it. The four cases mentioned here
illustrate each of these reasons.
Another case of purposeful disbelief, due probably,
I
think,
to
a
desire not to be burdened with moral teachings or restraint
which she feared, mistakenly, her friends in Spirit might lay
upon her, was that of
a
middle-aged woman living in Chicago
many years ago. Her mother,
a
very worldly woman, was
quite wealthy, but for many years did
a
great deal of sewing
to occupy her time. She did beautiful needlework and ex
pended all her talent on
a
pillow which she told her daughter
must be put
in
her casket without fail when she "died."
Finally she passed over. All her money was willed to the
daughter, and the latter obeyed her request
by
putting the
pillow
in
the casket.
Soon after the funeral the maid employed in the family be
came frightened and left.
A
succession of maids followed, all
leaving through fright. Finally an Irish girl came who pro
fessed to be afraid of nothing. After
a
few days she went to the
Skepticism 211
<
woman and said: "This house is haunted. Someone who died
recently is bothered about something. She came to me last
night and I saw her clearly, but do not know what the
trouble is."
"What did she look like?" asked her mistress.
The maid described the woman's mother and said they
would have to get a medium to find out what was the trouble.
Neither was a Spiritualist, but the maid knew enough to know
that a medium was necessary. "If I go to church, I expect my
priest to be there to conduct the service. If I want to talk to
Spirits, I look for a medium," was the way she put it.
They heard of me and came over to tell me their difficulty.
I realized it was the woman's mother who wished to tell her
something and agreed to go to her home and hold a seance.
The woman, her husband, and the maid were present. The
mother came right away. "Why aren't you happy?" asked her
daughter. "You were a good woman."
"Yes," said the mother, "but I find I don't need money in
the Spirit World. I want you to have my casket taken up and
opened. Take out the pillow I made and rip it apart."
They did not do this, and the maid kept seeing the mother.
They came for another seance, and the mother pleaded with
her daughter to open the casket and rip up the pillow.
Finally they decided to do so and found thousands of dol
lars in new paper money inside it. She realized after reaching
the Other Side that she had no need of this money and wished
it to be put where it would do good. "Give it to charity," was
her order.
The daughter did as she was instructed, but said she wished
212 The Voice Triumphant
»>»»»»»» >» »».> >>>>>>>>> >>».>>.>.>.>->.>.>->->
to have nothing further to do with Spiritualism. She said that
she thought her mother should keep on progressing and keep
away from her.
I could detail many other instances of skepticism, but do not
think it is necessary in order to bring out the point that a person
must have attained a certain amount of spiritual development
before he can understand and appreciate the truth and the
benefits of communication. Until this stage has been reached,
nothing can convince him. I will attempt no explanation of
the attitude or make any comments about those who have
reached this stage, have had the facts presented to them, and
then choose to say: "I do not care to believe."

PROTECTION OF THE SEANCE ROOM
THE
HOLDING OF LARGE PUBLIC SEANCES THROWS A HEAVY
burden upon the medium and her Guides in many differ
ent ways. I have explained how sensitive a medium is to the
vibrations thrown out by the people around her. Consider
what this must mean in a crowded seance room where all are
under a nervous strain, some very slightly so, others, the new
comers, terribly so! The number of people to receive messages
at one seance multiplies the physical drain on the medium
much more than private sittings because there is no let-up or
rest until the close of the long seance. The Guides not only
must arrange all the conditions necessary to establish com
munication, but have the added burden of regulating the con
duct of the visitors when it becomes necessary and seeing that
no persons or conditions are present that will disrupt the har
mony or endanger the medium. In this chapter I wish to dis
cuss the last of these tasks, which probably is the most ardu
ous, for the Guides at least, because of the gross ignorance of
spiritual laws of otherwise intelligent human beings.
One large seance had commenced, but the results were
very poor. Spirit friends who usually came in strongly and
213
214 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»».»»»»»»»»»»»»»».»>.>
cheerfully could scarcely hold a conversation for a minute. I
knew that something was decidedly wrong, but could not tell
what it was. Finally after quite a pause during which no voices
were heard, Snowdrop stood before a stranger and said: "Mis
ter, why did you bring that thing you have in your back
pocket?"
"I have nothing there," he lied.
"Oh yes, you have," Snowdrop corrected him. "It is a bottle
of whisky, and no man can come into this sacred place, seeking
his loved ones who have gone before, with any such thing as a
bottle of whisky. We will excuse you, and hope, for your own
good, that you throw the bottle away as soon as you get out
side."
The seance recommenced after he left, and proceeded with
its usual cheerfulness and harmony, the discordant vibration
having been eliminated.
On another occasion the light had been put out, but the se
ance had not started, when Snowdrop stepped before a man
and asked: "What is that you have in your back pocket?"
"My handkerchief, I guess," was his reply.
"Oh no, it is not your handkerchief, but a flashlight. You
came here intending to flash it on our medium, didn't you?
You don't realize in your ignorance that light flashed on her
at such a time would render her unconscious for hours if it
luckily did not kill her. Now, we shall not proceed any further
with the seance until you have left our home. Kindly leave at
once and take with you the two other gentlemen, your friends,
who came in separately, pretending not to be with you."
Protection of the Seance Room 215
<
I turned on the light and three men, all sitting in different
parts of the room, arose and with hanging heads filed out the
door.
"Honestly," said the man with the flashlight as he passed
me, "I meant no harm. I carry it to light up my garage at
night."
"You three gentlemen all getting up together is sufficient
evidence of the plan my Guide exposed. Kindly do not return."
This flashing of a light on a medium is the most dangerous
thing she must face in her work. It is the first and foremost
thought in the mind of every critic and "investigator" of Spir
itualism. In one way it is an excellent proof of the individual's
mental development, as he shows by this thought that he
trusts none of his senses except his physical sense of sight. He
admits tacitly that his mind and mental processes are not on a
par with those of the medium. He acknowledges that if trickery
did play a part in any of the phenomena he meets, he would
not be able to detect it except through his sense of sight. He
thus exemplifies the findings of educators —namely, that a
lesson can reach a child's brain through the channels of sight
when it cannot be made to through any other channel. Thus
his mental development corresponds with that of the back
ward child which must see everything before it can grasp it.
The man of brains who exercises his mind with many more
than the proverbial single daily thought process has sufficient
confidence in himself to come to a seance, sit in the dark, and
allow his Spirit friends to convince him by appealing to his
reason. Practically every case mentioned in this book contains
216 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
at least one test which would appeal to the reason of anyone
who was able to use his mind in a logical thought process, and
shows that such tests are given without end.
Throwing a bright light on a medium during the course of
a seance is the work of a moron, for the reason just given ; of a
coward, because no chance is given the medium to defend
herself from injury; and of a selfish fool, because no good
possibly could be obtained by the act.
After the damage has been done, the fool will say: "I did
not know that a light could hurt her." After all the precau
tions he sees are made to prevent the ingress of light into the
seance room, he should have sense enough not to produce
any light himself until he finds out whether it would do harm
or not, but of course an individual of this mental caliber is in
capable of reasoning to such a conclusion.
Would such a man go into the developing-room of one of
the major motion-picture companies and turn on a white light
while the original negative of a super-production was being
handled? And if he did, what would happen to him? Yet the
loss would be only that of a picture, representing, it is true,
a large amount of money, time, and brains, but not, as with a
medium, at the least great pain to a human being, at the most
the death of a human being. Would a fool like this go into a
research laboratory of the General Electric Company and
throw switches at random? What would happen if he did so
in the section where high-voltage work is being done?
Why would not a person do these two things? Is it because
he knows better and might do harm? No. It is because he
knows he would be punished severely in some form or other.
Protection of the Seance Room 21 7
««««««««««
Plenty of people would delight in spoiling a negative just for
the excitement if they knew they would not be punished.
Plenty of people would throw a switch in a power-house, know
ing it would ruin an expensive generator, if they could do so
without punishment. That is why I say such a man is a coward
to throw a light on a medium. He knows of no punishment for
his act. He is interfering with a natural law, however, and will
find there is a penalty, and a most severe one, when he reaches
the Other Side, as he usually will in a very short time.
To protect the seance room and the right of a medium to
hold seances, it has been necessary several times for me to
undergo arrest at the hands of the police both in Chicago and
'
in New York.
On one occasion in Chicago two strange women appeared
at my door and asked for a sitting. My Guides told me im
mediately that they were policewomen, but to give them a
sitting. I did so and both received messages which they said
were true.
They left and soon after I was served with a warrant charg
ing me with the "practice of Spiritualism."
I appeared in court. In answer to questions both by my law
yer and by the judge the two women testified that the mes
sages they received were true. One of the women then volun
teered the information that she had observed a little door in
the wall of the seance room and she was sure it was through
this that my accomplices came to fool my victims. Questions
by the judge developed the fact that this little door, about
four by five inches, had been put over my light-switch and
could be locked so that no one could switch on the seance
218 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.»»->>
room lights during the course of the seance.
The judge said that he did not think many accomplices
could get through that door, and as the messages given the
women all were true, he could not see where I had violated
any law. And lastly he informed everyone that Spiritualism,
being a religion, could not be interfered with and was pro
tected by the Constitution of the United States.
The case was dismissed.
When I was arrested in New York, the authorities attempted
to prove that I was a fortune-teller, but were unable to do so.
My standing as a medium was upheld.
Really, my friends, after almost thirty years of public work,
the apparent hopelessness of instilling love and gratitude in
human hearts after bringing most wondrous blessings from the
Spirit World, the persecution and battle undergone for the
sake of bringing these blessings where I think they are needed,
and the wrecking of my physical health from hard work and
meeting conditions so contrary to the vibrations the Spirit
World throws around a medium, I am almost ready to say
that the work is not worth the suffering.
People hasten to a medium as quickly as they can when in
trouble, but as soon as they are out of
it,
the medium
is
for
gotten. When
I
was arrested, many of my friends appeared in
court to assist me
if
they could, but they were
a
mere handful
compared with those who have been helped
by
the Stead
Center. After
I
was acquitted, many of the others came to con
gratulate me and to excuse themselves
by
saying they could
Protection of the Seance Room 219
<
not get away the day of the trial or had been sick, or with other
pretexts. They would not support me when I was in trouble,
but they expect the ultimate in help from me when themselves
in trouble.
I enjoy nothing so much as to give sittings to my few loyal
friends, bringing them blessings which I see them enjoy and,
by their work, deserve more, but to "cast such pearls before
swine" does appear to be useless, as our dear Jesus found out
so many hundreds of years ago.

SOME TIME
Some time when life's lessons have been learned
And sun and stars forevermore have set,
The things which our weak judgment here has spurned,
The things o'er which we grieve with lashes wet,
Will flash before us out of life's dark night
As stars shine most in deeper tints of blue,
And we shall see how God's plans were right,
And how what seemed reproof was love most true.
And we shall see how, while we frown and sigh,
God's plans go on as best for you and me ;
How when we called, he heeded not our cry
Because his wisdom to the end could see.
And even as prudent parents disallow
Too much of sweet to craving babyhood,
So God, perhaps, is keeping from us now
Life's sweetest things, because it seemeth good.
And
if,
sometimes commingled with life's wine,
We find the wormwood and rebel and shrink,
Be sure
a
wiser hand than yours or mine
Pours out this potion for our lips to drink.
And
if
someone we love
is
lying low,
221
222 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»»>>>>>>>>
Where human kisses cannot reach the face,
Oh, do not blame the loving Father so,
But wear your sorrow with obedient grace.
And you will shortly know that lengthened breath
Is not the sweetest gift God gives His friends,
And that some time the sable pall of death
Conceals the fairest boon His love can send.
If we could push ajar the gates of life
And stand within and all God's workings know,
We could interpret all this doubt and strife
And for each mystery could find a key.
But not today. Then be content, poor heart;
God's plans, like life's, pure and white, unfold.
We must not tear the close-shut leaves apart,
Time will reveal the calyxes of gold.
And
if,
through patient toil, we reach the land
Where tired feet with sandals loosed, may rest;
When we shall clearly know and understand,
I
think that we will say: "God knew the best."

VOICES IN THE SUNLIGHT
THE
PEOPLE, AND THEY ARE MANY, WHO BELIEVE THAT
communication between those who have passed through
a change called death and us who remain on earth is possible,
but is instigated by the devil cite as their principal argument
the fact that communication takes place in the dark. The world
from time immemorial has been taught that darkness is the
realm of the evil one, and light that of God. Therefore it is
not surprising that this view of communication should be held
by some. Proof beyond controversy has been given them of
the actuality of messages from their Spirit friends and they
cannot be convinced of the contrary. As it is to the interest of
certain organizations to prevent them from profiting by these
messages, it becomes necessary, therefore, to instill fear into
their hearts, and this is done by teaching them that it is the
work of the devil.
Even if it were true that the manifestations of those in the
Spirit World always occurred in the absence of light, I believe
I have given a reasonable explanation for it. It is not true,
however, that darkness is absolutely necessary, and conse
quently we can remove even that prop from the house of cards
which selfish teachers call "proof."
223
224 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>
There is no darkness to those on the Other Side—light is
eternal. Darkness exists only for us of the earth plane, who
are not sensitive enough to perceive the light that is present.
Of course it is true that the kind of light is different and is not
perceptible to our physical sight, but it is there for those who
can see it. I already have given examples of the effect of day
light on several physical and chemical phenomena and of the
way it interferes with a seance. There is another effect which
it has, and that is on the individual: it makes him tense and
resistant to everything beyond his view. His sense of sight is
functioning strongly and is bringing vivid pictures to his brain.
Very little chance remains for the infiltration of other impres
sions.
Thus it becomes quite evident that a very highly developed
and sensitive medium is necessary in order to make it possible
for communication to take place in the light.
Let me pause at this point for a moment to say that when
I make statements of this sort anywhere in this book, I do not
want my readers to misunderstand and think that I am given
to self-praise. I am doing my best to state facts and nothing
else and I take absolutely no credit to myself for my medi-
umistic development. This is a gift from God and my Guides,
and if I have been able to increase my sensitiveness and power
by my efforts to live a life worthy of my gift, I am glad that
I can bring just that much more help to the world.
To resume: a medium always furnishes by far the greater
part of the power required to build up the Forces at a seance.
Those who are sitting must furnish some part, but when the
demonstration takes place in the light, and the power from the
Voices in the Sunlight 225
««««.<.
sitters is cut down almost to nothing, the medium has to shoul
der practically the whole burden. If she is not very sensitive
and strong, no manifestation occurs.
If I had secured the voices in the light but once in my life,
I still could point with pride to that achievement. I have se
cured them, however, hundreds of times in the light, and often
over long periods.
The method employed may be described briefly as fol
lows: No attempt is made in any way to darken the room or
prevent the ingress of daylight or artificial light. The sitter
holds the small end of the trumpet toward himself, usually in
his open hand. It rests gently, with the large end toward me,
but the large end is not up to my mouth, or within a foot of my
head. I usually hold the large end of the trumpet in my open
hand, with my head turned from the trumpet, as all who are
present can see plainly.
The communications generally are in loud whispers, but
often singing will come through in a clear voice. Even the
whispers can be heard for some distance. The singing could be
heard for an ordinary city block or more if there were no
near-by disturbance. At times the voices are natural and clear.
They are what we call independent voices. This, however,
necessitates an experienced and absolutely sincere sitter and the
perfect harmony of the others present. The communications
are as lucid as they are in a seance room. They are as complete.
The identification is just as satisfactory. During one of these
bright-light seances, sometimes as many as thirty or forty or
even fifty voices will come through, each different. Perhaps
four or five will sing.
226 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>.>.>.>.>.>.>>>>>>
I repeat that these communications often are held in bright
light, contrary to the theories of the opponents of our great
Truth, some of whom decry our work as trickery and rank
fraud, and others again as the manifestation of satanic forces.
There is little that can silence the critics, however. I can
hear many at this moment say: "Yes, she holds the large end
of the trumpet near her. The small end is near the sitter. It is
very simple indeed for a ventriloquist to throw his or her
voice, especially as a whisper which is not easy to identify,
in the direction of that sitter, causing him to believe that it
comes through the trumpet."
I expected that, and therefore I shall present a further
illustration that will make such an explanation most difficult
of acceptance.
In the Stead Center in Chicago, which was located on Grant
Place, we had a large living-room, which was used as a meeting-
room, the dimensions of which were about thirty-two feet by
eighteen feet. This room faced on the street and had numerous
windows, sufficient to flood it with light. It had windows on
the north or street side, and on the east side, overlooking the
entrance to the Center. There was a large doorway near the
west end of the room, opening into the library. A larger door
way near the east end of this room opened into the reception
hall, from which the stairs led to the seance room, and other
rooms, on the second floor. There was a fireplace in the west
end of this room, the west wall being the outside wall.
We have held tests here for our own satisfaction which
would rather disconcert our critics. I use the word "tests,"
however, in a different sense from usual. These were not tests
Voices in the Sunlight 227
<. < <. < < <. <<. < <
or experiments in the sense of trying to detect fraud. I believe
that the conditions obtaining answered completely any accusa
tion of fraud that might be advanced. Their purpose was to
determine to what extent we could open the door and permit
our loved ones to communicate with us. We tested ourselves,
not my mediumship as a matter between fraud and honesty,
or the Spirit World as a source of genuine intelligence.
A sitter has placed his chair in about the north center of this
room, with the house lights turned out, but with the electric
lights from the street flooding the room. It was so light that
it was easy to distinguish the identity of every person in the
room; newspaper print could be read with facility. In com
pany with four or five others I stood near the east wall, and
the sitter held his trumpet, the small end toward his ear, with
the large end pointing about northwest, or away from me.
Not only did the voices come clearly, but they were so loud
that we who stood some eighteen feet away could hear every
word.
Not satisfied with this remarkable manifestation, we had the
sitter move to the west end of the room and sit this time, for
greater magnification of the sound, with the large end of the
trumpet near his ear and with the small end placed almost
directly against the solid west wall. The distance from myself
and the others with me was fully thirty feet.
Again the voices came through so clearly and loudly that
we in the east end of this large room could hear every word.
Singing supplanted the voices at times—singing that could
have been heard plainly by any passer-by on the street.
Now, if I can "throw my voice" this distance, without the
228 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
aid of any instruments or wiring or telephones, then I am
several hundred per cent better than any ventriloquist on the
stage and could make far more money for myself than ever
has been donated to me as a medium, and with more ease and
no criticism.
All mediums do not secure the same manifestations. One
medium cannot get the same results with all sitters. As far as
the loved ones on the Other Side are concerned, they ^re al
ways ready to communicate. If there are barriers, they are
earth-made or man-made. If there are climatic conditions that
prohibit clear communication, then it is because such conditions
affect mortals. They do not and cannot affect the other life.
The lower never can command the higher, and those who
have passed through the change cannot or will not come to us
and manifest their presence and intelligence if we do not per
mit them to, or if we shut ourselves out from such glorious
evidence of immortality through our ignorance.
One may say of these phenomena: "This would be remark
able if it were true. How do we know that it is true?"
There are persons in this world who would not accept an
unsupported statement upon any condition. There are many
who would not accept even the sworn accounts of scores. How
ever, I present this as true, and there are today in the world
thousands of persons who know that the statements I make in
this volume are true. This number includes many prominent
lawyers, judges, physicians, educators, ministers of the gospel,
corporation officials, bank officials, manufacturers, merchants,
and others generally regarded as sane.
Beyond all that, however, is this further fact that to me is

vastly more important:
What has occurred can happen again. This communication
in the light has been secured by many mediums. It will be
obtained by many more. It is as much an established fact that
communication is possible and practicable in the light as it is
that there is communication in any form.

OBSESSION AND IMPERSONATION
WE
ARE TAUGHT BY OUR GUIDES AT THE STEAD CENTER
that there is no such thing as obsession by evil spirits
or impersonation of our loved ones. The belief, however, in
both these conditions is so widespread that we will consider at
some length how it arose and why it is illogical.
Obsession implies evil and harm and is feared by those be
lieving it is possible. Probably the easiest way of keeping peo
ple in subjection is to instill fear into their hearts, fear of the
unknown, and keep them ignorant, because with knowledge
comes release from fear. This has been the almost universal
practice of all religions of which we have any record and has
proved a very effective means of enriching their clergy and
forming strong religio-political organizations.
After thoroughly frightening a man by horrible tales of the
unknown, it is not hard to sell him the idea of protection in
return for money. The narrator of these tales, calculated to
inculcate fear, claims intimate knowledge of the method of
combating the evil, and the power to do so, and undertakes to
protect his victim as long as he is paid to do it. In order to as
sure a steady income it is necessary periodically to awaken anew
this fear in the congregation, and thus a powerful organization
231
232 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
of professional fear-instillers (if I may use such a term), who
are too lazy or ignorant to earn their living any other way,
is built up and supported by those whom it has made its vic
tims.
Since the world always has had those selfish individuals who
care not what harm they do, provided they attain to temporal
wealth and power, it always has had its great mass of people
kept in ignorance and subjection by these individuals through
fear, and in consequence has made very slow progress during
the ages.
By what means has fear been instilled into man? For some
reason the unknown to most people is fearsome, and, knowing
this, the worthy gentry use it to maintain their power. They
know that with knowledge comes release from fear, and there
fore endeavor to keep their victims in as dense ignorance as
possible. Because abstract ideas are the most difficult to prove,
they have invented a force they call evil, and a devil to super
vise and direct it. The devil is described in the most terrible
terms in order to create as great an effect as possible. He is
supposed to obtain his power from his dominion over an un
numbered host of evil spirits whom he may set upon mortals
to suit his pleasure. He often is credited with more power than
God, because it is maintained that even good people can be
obsessed by these evil spirits if they fail to buy protection from
the devil or to appease him.
Has anyone ever proved the existence either of evil or of a
devil? We are taught by our Guides that there is no such thing
as evil. God intended that there should be good only. On
earth, because of ignorance, but only on earth, we frequently
Obsession and Impersonation 233
<
have a considerable lack of good and have called it evil. It is
this idea which has been seized upon by the professional re
ligionist through the ages and developed into the idea of a
powerful force, equal to, if not greater than, the force of
Good. Through indifference and ignorance we are breaking
God's natural law continually, and consequently do not at
tract the happiness and love we desire. Then we say we are
visited by evil. We are not suffering from evil or anything
else; we are suffering, it is true, but it is from a lack of some
thing, the love and the joy which our souls tell us we are en
titled to. Not knowing any better, we are inclined to listen to
explanations about "evil" from those who claim to know.
It might be asked why God should give power to those on
earth to do harm to others through their ignorance. He does
not do this. Those who attempt to injure others create nothing
but trouble for themselves. They may cause great inconvenience
and sorrow to their victims, but the injured ones are repaid
many fold usually on earth; if not, on the Other Side; and
restitution comes solely from the one causing the injury. It
seldom goes directly from the injurer to the injured, but the
wrong deed seems by its nature to raise up a good deed of equal
or greater force to counteract
it,
and the good
is
given to the
injured. The injurer pays sooner or later for the good deed
which God lent to his account.
Many people in their undevelopment think this idea of evil
is
of great help to them. When they involve themselves in
difficulties, they find
it
very convenient to have such an idea
to fall back upon. They can say the devil made them do thus
and so, or,
if
they have heard of Spiritualism, can say they were
234 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
obsessed by an evil spirit. This proves so helpful to their un
developed and lethargic minds and so convenient to their
aversion for accepting any responsibility that they cling tena
ciously to it without any thought of examining to find out
whether it is true or not or how much harm it may be doing
them. Through it they are missing much happiness that might
be theirs and are not acquiring spiritual development, the only
earthly possession they can take with them to the Other Side.
Every religion teaching Love and Truth and attempting to
remove fear from the minds of men in order that the way may
be opened for the entrance of Good and Knowledge for the
soul's development has been fought most vigorously by these
organizations fostering ignorance and has had relatively few
adherents because few are those who will labor and fight for
something from which they can see no monetary profit or
which does not compel them to do so through the fear it in
spires. Beauty seems to be something which everyone enjoys,
but which few are willing to labor for without material reward.
Many will work for anything from which they derive ma
terial profit or which they fear, no matter what it
is,
and will
destroy Beauty in its name.
How can we expect anything but trouble and disasters on
earth when men are imbued with such ideas? They create these
misfortunes for themselves and must suffer until they learn to
put themselves in harmony with God's plan. All this "evil"
they talk about
is
nothing more than their own ignorance and
failure to live as God intends we should live. If we lived in
harmony with His plan, we should find that "evil" had no
existence.
Obsession and Impersonation 235
<.
Nearly everyone agrees when discussing the subject that
passing over from this life to the next involves an improve
ment and not a retrogression. If any sort of existence after
earthly death is admitted, it is natural to regard this existence
as an improvement over the earthly one. Life, whether on
earth or in any other place, would lose all meaning if we con
tinually were to be set back after working decades to improve
ourselves. It would be a very foolish and pointless existence
to labor and strive for years to develop our understanding and
our souls only to be put back where we started after leaving
this earth. We should be no better than human elevators, go
ing up only in order to come down again. The organization
of the physical universe shows such perfection that no seri
ously thinking person can believe for a moment that God
would be so foolish and inconsistent in His organization of the
souls peopling this universe.
Logic and all the facts in our possession show that a definite
plan is in operation and that everything has its place in that
plan. We do not know of its beginning or of its end, but we
do see a continual progress in everything about us. When we
labor with understanding and with love, we find we improve
from babyhood to earthly death. Should not this improve
ment, in order to be consistent with any definite scheme, con
tinue when we are in the Spirit World?
Believing, then, that passing over to the Other Side means
progression, and that evil has no existence, we find that there
can be no such thing as an evil spirit. There are many who
have passed over who are ignorant and undeveloped, many
who lived entirely out of harmony with God's laws and sought
1
236 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
to injure others while on earth, but all these now are unable to
cause any harm or disturbance. God gives power to those in
the Spirit World to do good only. It is on earth alone that He
allows His souls to do much as they please in order to develop
themselves. That is their earthly experience. When they have
finished with that, they go to a world where they have other
experiences, but power to do anything contrary to God's law is
not one of them.
It is because of false teachings designed to instill fear that
persons otherwise quite sane, living good lives and with no
ulterior motives, insist with all sincerity that they are obsessed
by an evil spirit. I will recount two cases, among many with
which I am acquainted, which show how mistaken is this be
lief.
Answering my door-bell one day, I was confronted by a
large, dark woman who had a towel wrapped around her head,
giving her a rather wild, disheveled appearance. Somewhat
taken aback, I asked her what she wanted.
She told me that she was lost, but when I asked her whether
she lived in the neighborhood or not, she said : "Oh, I do not
mean lost that way. I know where I live, but I have been
abandoned by God and am possessed by evil spirits. I have
been to many places, but nobody helps me. One woman told
me to come to you."
I called in a neighbor, as I was alone and somewhat afraid
of the woman.
After conversing with her for some time and making no
progress, I decided the three of us had better enter the seance
Obsession and Impersonation 237
<
room to find out whether the Guides could offer any sugges
tions.
The woman asserted that she was not afraid of the dark or
of a seance and, as soon as the light was turned out, proved it
by becoming quite calm and rational. She explained that many
years ago, when sixteen years of age, she had run away from a
convent in which she was confined and believed now that the
spirits of the nuns had found her and put a curse on her.
I told her that such a thing was impossible, that God did
not allow anyone in Spirit to harm mortals. There must be
something else causing her trouble.
One of my Guides came in and, addressing her, said : "There
are no evil spirits around you. Even if there were any in the
Spirit World, they would not be allowed to trouble you. You
have been hurt. Don't you remember that six months ago you
fell from a street-car and struck your head? This injury must
be corrected, and when it
is,
you will find that all idea of evil
spirits around you will vanish."
Leaving the seance room soon after this,
I
called up a
surgeon with whom
I
was acquainted and described the case
to him.
I
asked him to bring two or three of his colleagues and
come to examine the woman.
Four physicians and surgeons entered the seance room with
this woman and me and listened to my Guide explain that
a
small fragment of bone was pressing on her brain at the point
where she had struck her head six months before. He said an
operation was necessary to correct the trouble.
The four doctors held
a
consultation and decided to take her
to the county hospital.
A
careful examination proved the need
238 The Voice Triumphant
>»»»»»»»»»».».»>»»»»»»»»»»
of this operation.
Two weeks after it was performed, the woman had lost all
idea of evil spirits troubling her. She had previously become
so erratic that her husband had left her, going to California
in his search for quiet. Coming back, after receiving word of
her operation, he found his wife as she always had been during
the many years of their marriage and resumed his happy life
with her.
Another case was that of a gentleman who came to me one
day complaining that evil spirits played about his head con
tinually and caused pain in his nose and forehead. My Guides
explained to him that there were no evil spirits about him, but
that there was pressure on the inside of his nose caused by a
growth which should be removed. After submitting to the
necessary operation all idea of evil spirits left him.
These two cases, among many other similar ones I might
describe, show that the idea of obsession can be caused by a
physical disability and can be corrected by physical means. In
the majority of cases, the claiming of obsession is nothing more
than an excuse, as I have explained. In a few other cases it is
believed in honestly by people who seek to ascribe some per
sonal idiosyncrasy or erratic behavior to a cause external to
themselves. These last should remember that like attracts like
all through the universe, and, even if they are not willing to
subscribe to all the spiritual teachings I have written down at
the beginning of this chapter, that they cannot attract evil un
less they themselves are evil. If they know that their daily
Obsession and Impersonation 239
«■<■ < <■ < <■ <■
work is done with love and joy, they may be assured that good
and happiness are the only things they will attract unto them
selves.
I believe that the question of "impersonation" should be
considered here, because many things said about obsession
apply also to this idea. I have found many, many persons be
lieving in Spiritualism to be of the opinion that their loved
ones in Spirit are impersonated frequently by others whom
they consider "evil spirits" or ones who love to play a joke on
mortals. The teachings of the Guides attending the seances at
the Stead Center are directly opposed to this. As progression
takes place when the transition called death occurs, so also does
God's plan prevent harm or injury of any sort being visited
upon mortals by those in Spirit. Practical joking is meaningless
entirely and consequently can have no place in a serious, or
derly system such as God's plan is. Also, mortals raise so many
barriers of their own between themselves and their loved ones
in Spirit that God, if for no other reason, would pity them and
not allow further barriers of misunderstanding to be raised
by practical jokers on the Other Side.
Some serious-minded people will say that they do not think
that their loved ones would be impersonated by others who
wished to play a joke, but that the impersonation is intended
to fool them. Please tell me what the Spirit World would gain
by such a procedure. There is absolutely nothing possessed by
a mortal which would be coveted by one in Spirit and con
sequently there is no reason why he should be fooled.
The only other reason for impersonation that I ever have
240 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>»>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>.>>>>»
heard expressed is that the one in Spirit is so anxious to hold a
conversation with the mortal because of his importance that
friends of his will be impersonated by the Spirit. This reason
is absurd and is given only by a person who is extremely ego
tistical and who, usually, has little cause for his egotism. Hero-
worship as we know it on earth does not exist on the Spirit
side of life, and even if it did, anyone will grant that there
are so many there who could deservedly inspire it that no
Spirit would have to seek out a mortal.
The Law of Attraction prevents any impersonation by those
in Spirit. When we come to understand this properly, we find
that souls, whether on the earth side of the veil or the Spirit
side, are attracted to one another only through love and from
common interests. A person attracts only those in whom he is
interested or who are interested in his work and seek to help
him. Even should he be of such character that he attracts ig
norant and undeveloped Spirits, God has so arranged it that
these are not able to harm him or to help him in any wrong
acts he may attempt. If you will cast out fear from your mind
and remember that you attract only those Souls who love to
come to assist you, you will find you will have no ideas of
obsession or impersonation.
So far I have been considering impersonation from the point
of view of those who profess a belief in Spiritualism. I should
now like to say just a few words in answer to skeptics who
claim that the medium impersonates their friends. To do this,
and to give the tests which even skeptics admit are true, as
sumes necessarily that the medium is in possession of the most
intimate knowledge possible of that person's life and friends.
Obsession and Impersonation 241
<■ <««««* <««««*
How is the medium to obtain this knowledge? Strangers come
to her who have made up their minds at a moment's notice
to visit her and have told none of their intentions. To acquire
the personal history of a mortal
is,
as we all know, an expensive
procedure and one which takes
a
very long time. There
is
no
such thing in existence as
a
card index of the intimate personal
history of every mortal, and this
is
the only thing which would
make possible any plausible impersonation
by
the medium of
anyone's departed relatives or friends at
a
moment's notice.
Even
if
such an index were in existence, the resources pooled
together of all the mediums on earth would not pay even the
running expenses of keeping
it
up to date, much less the cost
of the original compilation.
Impersonation
is
impossible
if
considered as being done
by
a
medium.
It
is
impossible
if
considered as being done
by
a
Spirit, because God's Law of Attraction will not permit of it.
Considered from any point of view,
it
is
not reasonable, be
cause nothing good could be gained
by
it
and those in Spirit
have developed to the point where they do nothing at random.
The idea
is
born only in man's earthly, suspicious nature and
has no place in the Spirit World or among those earnestly
seeking to live their lives to the best of their understanding of
a
loving God's beautiful plan.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <

HAUNTING
THE
BELIEF IN SPIRITS' HAUNTING SUCH PLACES AS HOUSES
and burial grounds is age-old and the proofs have been
too numerous and have come to too many people to be dis
missed lightly with an "Oh, those people imagined it." Haunt
ing, however, always has been considered something evil,
something that will annoy or harm man, and in consequence
inspires fear.
This it should not do. As I have explained before, there is no
such thing as evil; there is no harm coming to man from the
Spirit side of life; only help and love. If a man while on earth
dearly loved his home, spent many happy hours planning it
and building
it,
and saw his children grow from babyhood to
manhood and womanhood
in
it,
there
is
every reason why he
would visit
it
and linger about
it
after passing over. He would
in absolutely no sense be earth-bound, as some people think.
He appreciated some of the beauty of earth while he lived here
and
is
in
a
better position to appreciate the beauty
in
his new
surroundings. Endeavoring to console his loved ones and to
help them, he
is
more than likely to try to let them know
he
is
around
by
rapping on
a
table or any other object that will
give forth
a
sound. Such
a
manifestation should be received
243
244 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»»>»»>>»»»»»»»»»»»»■>
with thankfulness and with the prayer that soon strength for
more beautiful evidences of his presence will come.
Other persons linger about their earthly abodes for a short
time because they do not realize as yet that they have passed
through the change called earthly death. They still go about
their affairs as they did while here. The account of the land
lord who came to collect his rent, although he had passed over,
illustrates this point. (This is in the chapter on "The Other
World.")
That those on the Other Side often are seen about ceme
teries is not at all surprising. Those who passed with little
spiritual development and understanding do not know what
has happened. They follow their earthly body to its last
resting-place and then linger by
it,
knowing not where to go
and often thinking there
is
no other place. It sometimes takes
our Spirit teachers several days to bring such persons out of the
daze they wander in, and until this
is
done,
it
is no wonder
that they may be seen about their burial place. Far from being
feared, they should be pitied, and those people who are suffi
ciently mediumistic to see them should rejoice in their power
and not be frightened.
Sometimes
a
place
is
haunted because
a
wrong has been done
there and the one in Spirit
is
trying to correct that wrong. Until
he does so, he visits the place frequently because his own de
velopment in Spirit depends upon his success. The following
case turned out to be one of this type, and the man involved
should not be considered earth-bound. He had
a
task to per
form and he was doing it. The labors of many on the Other
Side are concerned sometimes almost wholly with the affairs
Haunting 245
<
of earth, for a while at least, but as all is part of God's uni
verse, they are spiritual labors and contribute to the Soul's
spiritual progression.
The term "earth-bound" should not be used indiscrimi
nately, as it almost always
is,
but should be reserved for those
in
Spirit who so love the vices of earth that they consort con
tinually with those mortals of similar tastes.
It
is
to be remem
bered that they have no power to influence these mortals in
any harmful way; they can enjoy the mortal's pleasure to some
slight extent, but are powerless
in
every way over him.
If
such
an earth-bound soul, after
a
period of years, refuses to try to
develop himself, he
is
reincarnated, usually
in
a
place where
temptation to his particular earth longing
is
slight, in order
that he may have every possible opportunity to improve him
self.
Some years ago
a
house
in
Chicago, belonging to
a
wealthy
woman, gained the reputation of being haunted.
It
was
a
three-story red brick building surrounded
by
spacious lawns.
At that time such
a
piece of property in its neighborhood was
worth
a
great deal of money, but this woman could neither
rent the house nor sell it.
It
stood empty for years.
Finally
I
was asked to organize
a
committee to investigate
and determine whether
it
really was haunted as reports said,
or not, and
if
it
was, to find out the reason
if
possible.
I
gathered together
a
group of three men and
a
woman,
most of whom were emphatic
in
their disbelief
in
haunted
houses. The five of us went to the place and entered the
building.
246 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■>■>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
No sooner were we inside the door than we began to hear
noises all over the house. The stairs creaked as though some
one were walking up them. Sharp cracks sounded from many-
different places. We finally found that in a large clothes-closet
on the second floor, we had partial darkness and could hear the
sounds loudly. Standing in a group in it one of us asked: "Is
there any dear Spirit here who would like to speak to us?"
The answer came distinctly in a man's voice: "Yes!"
We asked him why he haunted the house so that it could
not be rented.
He told us that he had bought this house from the woman
years ago and brought his wife and four children to live in it.
She held an eight-thousand-dollar mortgage on it and told
him she would be lenient and that he need not worry if he
could not pay it when it became due. Being a hard-working,
strictly honorable man, he struggled to meet the payments and
succeeded until the mortgage itself fell due. He was unable to
pay the whole of
it,
and, instead of being lenient with him as
she herself had volunteered to be, she foreclosed. The shock
and sorrow were so severe to him that they caused him to pass
to the Other Side. He said: "I am not an evil spirit and
I
am
not revengeful, but this woman did
a
very wrong thing. She
is
wealthy and had no need of the principal of the mortgage
and should have renewed it. God gives people money to help
others. As the retribution she can understand best
is
loss of
money,
I
have been given the power to come here whenever
it
is
necessary to prevent her renting the house or selling
it
for
any amount near its value.
I
am guiding my children and they
are getting along all right. People on the earth plane do not
Haunting 247
<
understand that it all is God's earth and everyone has the right
to live on it in peace and happiness."
His story made the situation very plain and we left entirely
convinced of the righteousness of his cause.
The woman finally sold the house at a figure so low that she
lost much more than the amount of money out of which she
had defrauded him.
Cases somewhat similar to this occur every once in a while
and show that people do not escape the consequences of the
injuries they attempt to inflict on others.
I believe that haunting usually occurs because of the love
the one in Spirit has for a place or his friends in it. It should
not be considered anything fearsome, and the weird tales about
such places should be viewed as wild flights of fancy based
either upon harmless facts or, most often, upon no facts at all.

THE JOY OF LIVING
by Ed. Hearne, inspired by
snowdrop
I used to roam in darkness;
Tried to climb the steeps alone;
Tried to believe that life was cold and bare —
Till one day a voice I heeded,
Then no other proof I needed,
For I found that joy was everywhere.
Day and night that voice is with me,
Teaching me just how to live;
Giving me the things that I've longed for.
Now life's path is strewn with flowers,
Weeks and months seem but as hours,
'Cause that voice is with me evermore.
I once failed to see the beauty
Of God's flowers in the wood,
Till one day a face I saw beneath the bloom.
I now easily can trace
The magic beauty of some face
Within each budding blossom in my room.
Day and night those faces guide me,
Show me joy where once was pain,
249
250 The Voice Triumphant

Lessons to me always they are giving.
Since these voices came to me,
And these faces I can see,
I have fully learned the Joy of Living.

INTIMACY
NOT
BY ANY MEANS ARE ALL A MEDIUM'S EXPERIENCES
with the Spirit World confined to the seance room and
the wonderful things her Guides can do there through her. I
often have beautiful personal visions and also see and talk
with those on the Other Side at any hour of the day or night.
Sometimes, even though I am used to this and know it will
happen, I am frightened or embarrassed at the moment, the
absolute clearness and realism of the Spirit presence prevent
ing me from telling that it is not human.
I received quite a fright one night in my home in New
York. Because of an unusual infestation of mosquitoes I had
formed the habit of retiring in the dark, depending only on
what little light came from a street-lamp some distance away.
On this particular night I was preparing for bed when my
hand hit a man in the abdomen. In startled surprise I looked
up and saw a large blond man smiling at me. I threw my gown
around me and rushed downstairs, telling my mother-in-law
that a burglar was in my room.
"Nonsense," she said, "no one could get up there."
"But I touched him and he was like flesh and blood," I ex
claimed.
251
252 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>> ».> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>> >.»>».»».>.>
Finally I calmed down and, remembering that he had been
smiling at me, I gained courage to go back to the room. I could
still see him clearly, as he said: "I am sorry I frightened you,
but I did not know I was not supposed to come wherever a
medium was."
This impressed me greatly, and to the guests assembled at
the next Friday evening seance I told my experience and de
scribed the man. While I was talking, a woman who never had
been to any seance before began to cry. I asked her what the
trouble was and she said: "You are describing my husband,
who died two weeks ago."
Later in the seance he came to her and said: "You know
that I am new here, and when they told me I could tell a
medium by the radiance she shed all about her, I came to
Medie Cook as soon as I saw her light. I guess I arrived at the
wrong time, but I knew you were coming here and I wanted
to prepare to greet you."
Another time, while bending down doing my "daily dozen"
in the privacy of my room, I glanced to my right and saw a
long pair of masculine legs. Hurriedly straightening up, I saw
they belonged to a man whom I knew, but did not know had
passed to Spirit. I told him that even a medium should be al
lowed a little privacy and that he should not come at such a
time. He just laughed and stood there watching me as I con
tinued my exercises.
While I was taking a sun-bath one day, an elderly gentle
man whom I had known for many years and who recently had
passed over came to me to tell me he wanted a party on his
birthday and wished a certain kind of ice-cream. I told him I
Intimacy 253
<• < <
already was arranging his party and that he might have waited
until I had finished to tell me this. He said that he knew
it,
but was so anxious that
I
get the right ice-cream that he couldn't
wait.
This same man came to me the morning he passed over.
It
was Christmas day and
I
was sitting at my piano practicing.
Suddenly
I
heard someone say: "Please, Medie, play 'Lead,
Kindly Light.'
"
I
began
it
and then saw him —he was
a
great lover of that
hymn —build up beside the piano. "I am not sick and in pain
any more, Medie.
I
passed over this morning, early."
A
few hours later
I
received the telegram telling me of his
passing.
A
year or two ago in New York Dr. Senn came to me one
day and told me that
a
member of the Center, a young man,
was very sick
in
a
hospital in Chicago. The Guides were doing
all they could for him, but promised nothing.
A
few days later
I
went into the seance room, and just before
I
turned on the
light,
I
saw him standing there. This was about seven o'clock
in
the evening. When we had
a
brief family seance
a
short
time later, Snowdrop told us he had passed over at six thirty.
His mother's letter later confirmed this and proved he had
appeared to me only half an hour after passing over. This
is
one of the reasons for my statement in another part of the book
that
I
know
a
Spirit can manifest his presence to
a
medium
within
a
few minutes of his passing.
I
went to see my lawyer one day in New York about some
papers he was preparing for the Center. Finishing our
254 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>»>>>.>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>».»>>>>>
consultation near noon, he told me to wait in the outer office for
a few minutes and we would go to lunch together. As I stepped
out of the room, I saw two men sitting on a bench. Thinking
nothing of it,
I
sat down in
a
chair and then noticed the younger
man looking at me intently.
Presently he spoke and said: "Are you not Mrs. Cecil M.
Cook, the medium?"
I
told him
I
was, but that
I
did not know him.
"I was sure
it
was you because
I
have seen your picture in
the magazine. Isn't
it
wonderful
I
should meet you here on
my first visit to this office? Won't you come over here to this
bench so that
I
can talk with you?"
I
went over, and as
I
sat down, the older man who had been
sitting with him disappeared.
I
looked surprised and the young
man asked me what
I
was looking at so queerly.
I
said: "Who was the good-looking elderly man who was
sitting with you and where on earth did he go?"
"I have been here almost an hour and no one has been near
this bench except you," he replied.
Then he asked me what the man looked like, and when
I
described him, he cried: "Goodness, Mrs. Cook, you are de
scribing my father, but he has been gone twelve years."
"I don't care how long he has been gone, that
is
the
man
I
saw sitting with you and
I
thought he was
a
human
being."
The young man went on to tell me that he had thought of
going to Chicago (where
I
then lived) to see me. He had been
interested
in
Spiritualism for
a
number of years, but never
had received any satisfying results.
Intimacy 255
«<
"How wonderful it is that I should come into a public office
like this with no such thought in mind and receive word from
my father!"
He subsequently had many beautiful experiences.
A number of years ago in Chicago several of my pets were
poisoned, one after the other. I could not find out who was
mean enough to do such a thing, but finally suspicion rested on
a neighbor, a woman who had expressed a dislike for me and
my Truth. I could prove nothing, but not long after this she
passed to Spirit. One night while I was lying in bed, she ap
peared before me and begged forgiveness, saying she had
poisoned the little dogs not realizing how wrong she was to do
such a thing.
A few months ago while I was riding in an automobile on a
long trip, a woman appeared to me who years ago had attended
many of my seances. I had not seen her for a long time, but
realized she must have passed over recently. She seemed very
happy and told me how much she loved her new home. A few
days later I received word of her passing on the day I had
seen her in the car.
The frequent appearance to the medium of those on the
Other Side and her visits with them, as natural as with persons
on earth, place her in the position of living in two worlds at
once, and it is the beauty of thought and expression she sees
on the Spirit side that makes the earth side, especially in
its coarser aspects, so painful to her. When one has not
256 The Voice Triumphant

experienced a certain beauty, one cannot miss
it;
but after hav
ing seen this beauty of the Other Side,
a
medium desires most
intensely to bring as much of
it
as possible to earth so that
others also may enjoy it.

VISIONS
OTHER
SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES OCCURRING TO ME OUTSIDE
the seance room are the beautiful visions I have so fre
quently. They usually come when I am asleep and sometimes
are difficult to distinguish from an ordinary dream, but usually
they are so very clear-cut and definite that I have no trouble
deciding. My spirit seems to leave my body temporarily and
journey in the astral world, where it is shown some scene or
experience, which almost invariably is symbolic. Sometimes,
on waking, the meaning of the vision is quite clear, often it is
not and I must wait days, months, even years before finding
out its portent. As such visions always give warning or consola
tion to me or to members of the Center, I do my best to learn
their meaning and interpret them correctly. As I have shown
all through this book, my Guides and friends on the Other
Side continually are at work consoling us and helping us, but
sometimes it appears that they either do not know of some im
pending event or are unable to communicate it to us properly.
Under such conditions I usually have an astral experience,
and by receiving the message in that way I know that it must
be important and deserves careful consideration. Such a beau
tiful experience, too, offers great consolation in time of trouble
257
258 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
or sickness.
When I suffered a nervous break-down, superinduced by a
case of ptomaine poisoning, I had two very beautiful visions,
both before I became seriously ill with the complications that
set in. All my life until that time I had been healthy, although
I was very sensitive to disease because of the great drain my
work puts on my vitality, but a short treatment and rest al
ways brought me through in apparently unimpaired condition.
For this reason I was inclined to overwork and neglect proper
care of myself, feeling that a slight illness which I readily
could throw off would be the worst result. I felt too that my
Guides would protect me. They told me quite often that I
should not work so hard and should take a good vacation each
summer, but for years I never did, feeling that always I should
be accessible to anyone in need of my services.
I have found out that I was wrong in several ways. In the
first place I was putting an unnecessary burden upon my
Guides. Effort they were using to keep me well could have
been applied elsewhere. In the second place I was progres
sively weakening my system. Prompt recovery from illness
was not complete recovery; some of the poison from the dis
ease remained in my body and was added to by each succeeding
illness. Finally, after it was too late, I began to take short vaca
tions and tried to ease my work. I was able to defer the day of
reckoning, but that was all.
Dining one day at a big hotel in New York City, I ordered
a vegetable luncheon. It was very temptingly served and
tasted good. As I started to eat
it,
I
seemed to get an impression
from
a
Guide of mine who was
a
doctor that
I
should not do
Visions 259
«<■
so; being hungry, however, and in a condition far from suitable
for clear reception of a message from my Guides because of
the bustle and confusion about me in the large dining-room,
I thought I must be mistaken and went on eating. Soon after
finishing and before rising from the table I became so sick and
dizzy I thought I should faint. Not realizing what the trouble
was and thinking the fresh air would revive me, I made a
great effort to reach the street. How I got home I do not know
to this day. I went to bed and stayed there for months. The
ptomaine poisoning, caused by a spoiled canned vegetable in
the luncheon, my Spirit doctor told me, was the spark that set
off the whole train of sickness from the overwork and accumu
lated poison of years.
As I was recovering from the ptomaine poisoning and
thought I was getting well, I had a vision one night. Both my
parents are on the Spirit side of life. I saw my mother approach
me. She looked at me for a few moments without saying any
thing. I asked her where my father was and she then spoke
and said he was there too. "You cannot come to us yet, dear,
no, not yet," she continued.
Then my father appeared, smiling tenderly at me, and told
me the same thing. He seemed to have rich black dirt in a
basket by his side and now began scattering this around.
"You must stay in the earth plane because you have much
to do yet. Your work is unfinished and you must be brave and
fight to get well so that you can complete it before you pass
over. Do not worry, because you will come out all right ; all
your Guides and friends on this side are doing their utmost
for you."
260 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>
Saying this, he disappeared, taking my mother with him.
The scattering of the black dirt was a sign that I had many
things yet to start and to carry through before I should go to
the Other Side.
The next day I talked this over with my nurse, but I could
not see why I should receive such a message. I was recovering
and felt that, as always in the past, I should be up and around
in a few more days. I had many things planned, and no
thought of not being able to finish them had occurred to me
until now.
Two weeks after this I had another vision. A group of
friends and I appeared to be standing at the edge of a bay
looking across it at a beautiful large white boat anchored in deep
water. It was so splendid that after observing it for a few mo
ments I exclaimed: "Oh, we must go on this magnificent ship,
all of us."
We saw a small row-boat near us on the shore and climbed
into it. The others started to row while I stood in the center
and watched the large boat. While some distance away, I saw
the anchor being weighed and called out to them to wait for
us as we wanted to go with them. As we neared the side, I saw
a kindly-faced man, serene with the dignity of authority, look
ing down upon us. Instinctively I knew he was the master.
"Oh no, you are not ready for this boat, none of you. You
cannot come with us."
Pointing to one of the young women in the row-boat with
me, he said: "It won't be long before that young lady can
come, but you yourself are not ready yet."
Exceedingly disappointed at not being allowed to go aboard
Visions 261
<
that splendid ship, we rowed sadly back to shore.
The next day I thought over this vision carefully. It must
mean that the persons boarding that boat were those passing
to the Spirit World and that our failure to get on it was a
message saying that, no matter what happened in the immedi
ate future, we should not pass over, myself in particular. Yet
the master had said that one of us, whom he had pointed out,
would be able to go aboard soon. This girl lived in Europe,
and, while I knew she was not in the best of health, still I had
no reason to think that she was dangerously ill. However, she
passed over within a year.
A week after this I was desperately sick with a complica
tion of influenza, nervous break-down, and several other
things. I certainly realized now why I had had those two vi
sions, and the message conveyed through them was so definite
and inspiriting that I fought to get well, knowing that the
time to terminate my earthly existence had not yet arrived. I
must stay here to complete the work the Spirit World had
planned for me to do.
Sometimes I have visions while awake, usually in the se
ance room. Such visions always refer to one of those attend
ing the seance and almost invariably to the imminence of his
passing to the Other Side.
On one occasion a man and his grown son were present at a
seance. No sooner had it commenced than I saw a woman in
Spirit build up near him. I described her and was told that she
was the boy's mother. Then she rose slowly up, going higher
than the material ceiling of the room. All the time she kept
262 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
her face toward her son and beckoned to him.
I said nothing about this at the time, but later, when alone
with the father, who, by the way, was a medium himself, I told
him what I had been shown.
"I hardly understand that," he said, "because the boy cer
tainly is strong and well and has no appearance of one about
to pass over."
I agreed with him, but felt that that was the only reasonable
interpretation to give the vision. He finally agreed with me.
This was in December. The young man was taken sick the
following February and passed over in a few days.
Another time a woman was brought to me by a common
friend. The first thing I saw when the two of us entered the
seance room was a coffin with this woman in it. Above it I
could see a large figure 3. 1 knew that no other message would
come or be of any use to her, so I got up and told her that I
could do nothing for her. She was very much surprised, as like
wise was her friend waiting for her.
Later my friend came back and asked me what the trouble
had been. First obtaining her promise not to report what I
should say, I told her of the vision.
"I thought it must be something like that," she said, "be
cause I knew the Guides could give her a message."
The woman was young, quite healthy, and of the very strong
type, happily married, and with three lovely children. She
certainly gave no impression of one about to pass over, but
three weeks later to a day, she did pass.
She loved her husband and children and for a long time was
Visions 263
<
inconsolable. Finally she found she could help her loved ones
from her new home and gradually lost her grief in her loving
labor.
I know of a number of people unacquainted with Spiritual
ism who have had visions similar to mine. One of these is a
Milwaukee school-teacher whom I later became acquainted
with.
For years she had been an intimate friend of the principal
of the school she taught in and of his wife. They had an only
child, an extraordinarily lovable boy, whom she knew from
the time he was born and whom she loved as much as any child
which might have come to her. He reached high-school age
and was a member of the class she taught.
One night she had a vision in which she saw this boy stand
ing and gazing up into the sky. Following his glance, she saw a
cloud which appeared partially to support and cover a group
she took to be angels. As she was looking, the boy seemed to
float up to this cloud, and as he reached
it,
he turned around
to wave back to her, saying: "I am going to my new home.
It
won't be long now."
Waking up, she was so agitated she could no longer sleep.
She realized that this must mean something about the im
minence of the boy's passing and she prayed that he be allowed
to remain on earth for
a
long time yet.
The next morning she sought out the principal and told him
what she had seen. He was very much disturbed and inter
preted the vision in the same way as she had done. They
decided not to alarm the mother, but to tell the boy himself.
264 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»»»»»
When informed of
it,
he smiled and said
it
was all the same
to him
j
he was happy on earth, but was sure he would be in
heaven also
if
it
was his time to go.
(Remember that none of these people knew anything
about Spiritualism. They truly showed remarkable spiritual
development.)
One month later he was taken ill and passed over to the
Other Side within
a
few days.
Two weeks after his passing
I
visited Milwaukee, and this
teacher came to one of my seances. The boy was the first one
to come in. He told her that she had been shown
a
vision
a
short time before to let her know that his time to pass had
come.
This was
a
beautiful test which she accepted gratefully. She
reported her experience to the boy's father, who came to the
next seance with her. Both were beautiful characters and be
came steadfast Spiritualists.
Visions are most beautiful experiences and come to medi
ums, and occasionally to other people of some degree of spir
itual development, when there
is
any necessity for them
j
when
they can bring help or consolation.

EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS
JUST
AS VISIONS COME, SO DO OTHER BEAUTIFUL SUPERNAT-
ural experiences come to people without the presence of a
medium. For this to happen it is necessary for the person to be
sensitive spiritually, although not necessarily aware of Spir
itualism. I should like to recount a few cases where friends of
mine have received such experiences as these, frequently when
I have been far away from them. In this connection it will be
interesting to refer to the minister's story of the woman of his
congregation seeing two of her children who had passed over.
This appears in the chapter on "Deception."
One night a young married woman was awakened, she knew
not how, from a sound sleep to find a spirit of a man stand
ing in the doorway of her bedroom. Considerably frightened,
not realizing he was in Spirit, she attempted to waken her hus
band, but found she could not move or speak. This man walked
round the foot of the bed to her side and said: "Don't be afraid
of me. You do not know me, but I want to give you a message.
I worked as a mechanic on this apartment building you are
living in and never did anything wrong in my life. One day
I was accused of stealing some tools and discharged. I want
265
266 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>.>->>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
you to tell them I did not do it."
The man disappeared, and as soon as he was gone, she found
she could awaken her husband. Doing so, she told him what
she had seen and heard.
They came over the next day to see me, and our Guides
told them that it was true, such a man had worked there and
had been discharged, the shock of the injustice causing him to
pass over. They were told to go to their landlord and ask him
about it.
He had appeared to this young woman apparently because
he realized that through her his message could be conveyed
and he could be helped to overcome his feeling of sadness. In
a situation of this sort a man conscientiously trying always to
do what was right will retain a feeling of sadness at the in
justice done him and possibly some resentment if he has not
developed past that stage, and almost invariably will visit
occasionally the scene of his trouble. These ideas occupying
his mind will retard his progress. The friends he meets on the
Other Side, few, because he does not seek them, will try to
help him overcome this condition, but may not have the power
to do so completely. As he begins to understand what is nec
essary, he will seek
it,
and in this case he evidently realized
that the young woman was in close contact with powerful
Guides and not only would deliver his message, but also would
bring him into touch with our Guides of the Center, who are
used to teaching, not only mortals, but those on their own side
of the veil.
This
is
what happened, because as soon as the story was told
to Mr. Stead, he sought the man out and was able to explain
Experiences of Others •
267
<
everything so clearly that the man cast off his sadness and be
gan the useful work and progress which his efforts on earth
entitled him to.
(In this connection it will be interesting to recall what was
said in the chapter on "Haunting.")
One little girl about two years old would sit on the floor
and talk and play by the hour with two playmates she called
Sarah and Marcella. No one could see anyone with her, but
she acted as though there were. After this had gone on for
some time and I had seen it myself, I asked her why she talked
to no one but those two children whom the rest could not see.
In her baby way she told me they were two little girls who
came to play with her from that nice place "pirit" and that
they were twins.
Finally I decided to ask my Guides in the seance room and
they told me the baby was right, that the two little girls were
twins and did come to play with her. She even had their names
right.
The sight a man had one time of a friend of his who had
passed over to the Other Side was the cause of his first visit to
a seance. Like so many people who have turned to this Truth
as the only satisfying philosophy of life after so-called death,
this man, who was an artist, was little short of an infidel when
he first entered my seance room. He gave no thought to the
morrow, had no belief in any existence after material death.
He had a friend, however, who had been his pal from boy
hood—a splendid fellow whom he affectionately termed
268 . The Voice Triumphant
>>.>■>»>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.»»
"Red" and who in turn called the artist "Charley," though
Charley was not his name. Almost from babyhood these two
boys had been friends ; they grew up as schoolmates ; they
were boon companions as the years rolled by.
Finally the day arrived when Red's earthly existence was
to end, and he passed of gastritis within two hours of the time
he was stricken.
That day something seemed to come between the sun and
the artist friend who was left behind. The light seemed to have
gone out of his life. His grief was deep and terrible. Because
he had no sustaining belief in any hereafter, he almost was in
capacitated for business; the artistic touch had gone out of his
work. He walked round doing his daily duties, but appeared
as one in a haze.
Some three weeks after his friend had passed over, Charley
was walking north on Dearborn Street—on the west side of the
street —crossing Monroe, when he glanced up and saw, cross
ing the street diagonally toward the northwest corner, his
friend "Red," smiling as only "Red" could smile. Bewildered,
but believing his senses implicitly, Charley hastened to catch
up with his friend, who had turned east on the north side of
Monroe Street as soon as he saw he had attracted Charley's
attention. Twice or thrice he caught sight of "Red's" tantaliz
ing smile, but, as he was not overtaking him, began to run. In
front of the Majestic Theatre he collided with a friend whom
he had not seen for years. "Red" had disappeared.
"Why, old top," exclaimed his friend, "why this wild-eyed
haste? You look like a man who has seen the supernatural."
"I have," Charley replied, and hastily recounted his strange
Experiences of Others 269
<-
experience.
"Then," his friend observed, in a most matter-of-fact man
ner, "why don't you go where you can talk to 'Red'?"
"Talk to him?" Charley asked incredulously.
"Certainly," responded his friend, and proceeded to tell
him about me and gave my name and address.
The next Sunday evening Charley came to my seance, and
his friend "Red" was the first one to come in.
"Charley," said a voice in front of him, "this is Red. I finally
got you to come to speak to me, didn't I? I wanted you to
bump into Fred because he could tell you where to come, and
when you saw me Friday afternoon, I was able to lead you to
him. You see, old boy, you were all wrong about that death
idea. You never stop living. God gave us life, and He never
takes away anything He gives. He never takes away a dear
friend or companion. Nothing ever is lost. I am not lost to
you, even though you no longer can see me. Now, old boy,
get back to your paints and your brushes and crayons and don't
feel down-hearted. Get more of the love of God in your heart
and you will find that your sorrow will leave you."
Thus was Charley introduced to his friends and Guides on
the Other Side.
There is a professional man in Chicago who lost his daughter
many years ago. Nothing else in all his experience struck him
quite so hard as that. It was a crushing blow. He felt that the
end of all things had been reached until he finally began to
come to my seances. Often now he had private sittings. He
held long communications with his dear one. His heart was
270 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>
hungry, and his soul athirst for more frequent visits from her,
or recognition of the visits which she assured him he did re
ceive.
Patiently he did all he could to develop spiritually, to
strengthen the bond of love uniting him with his dear one on
the Other Side. Father and daughter had understood one an
other fully. They had been the most intimate of companions.
Finally the time came when he both heard and saw. He
saw his dear one as clearly as he had when she was in this
world. He heard her voice as naturally. Often she told him
things that still were to transpire. She helped him in his busi
ness. She gave him information about loved ones on the earth
plane who were absent. She was a beautiful consolation and
inspiration to him.
Such experiences as this man has indicate that he possesses
a considerable degree of psychic power.
One family in Chicago, devout believers in our Truth, often
reported unusual physical manifestations in the light. For ex
ample, in their home was a built-in china-closet at one end of
the dining-room, just above a built-in buffet.
One noon they were eating luncheon when they heard a
loud knock in the china-closet. Looking up, they saw an entire
pile of dishes suddenly turned upside down —the bottom
most becoming the topmost. Not one plate was chipped or
broken!
At other times cups would set up a lively jig and keep this
up for some moments, and yet not one of the other dishes
would move.
Experiences of Others 271
<
A friend of mine in a restaurant one day was about to cut
into a piece of pie when the pie without any evident reason
flopped off the plate and on to the floor. Others near by, wit
nessing the strange freak, laughed and were greatly puzzled.
Later, at a sitting, his Guides told him that the pie was
spoiled and would have poisoned him. There was no time to
wait. They drew upon me, at a distance —miles away —and
upon him and upon others for the force required thus to mani
fest physically. They prevented his eating the pie.
Another man, while riding in a street-car, felt a distinct
nudge at his elbow. There was nobody close to him, but he
looked round and saw a friend passing on the street whom he
had not seen for months. The friend surely did not nudge him!
While a child, and before I was aware of the nature of the
phenomena with which I was in such intimate contact, I knew
of a case of Spiritual manifestation of power in the absence
of a medium. At the time it seemed only natural to me, be
cause I knew nothing about mediums. A man in our community
willed his estate to his wife and asked her very earnestly and
sincerely not to will it to a second husband if she married
again, but to give it to certain relatives whom he named. He
wished it to remain in his family as it had for several genera
tions.
Some time after he passed over, his widow married again
and for some reason or other disregarded her first husband's
earnest request and willed the estate to her new husband.
She passed over to Spirit not long after this and soon was
272 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
seen by various people at ten o'clock each night walking in
her garden. I saw her myself. Her second husband saw her
and, feeling that he must have persuaded her wrongly to give
the property to him, deeded it to those to whom the original
owner wished it to be given.
This is another case where people might consider a spirit
was "haunting" her old home. She loved her garden, as every
one in the neighborhood knew, but what she was trying to do
was to correct the mistake she had made.
Soon after I started my public work, a woman came to me
in great grief. She recently had lost her little boy, a child
seven years old, and was almost distracted. Her child came
to her and begged her not to cry so. There must be a reason
for his passing and he wanted her to take joy in the fact that
she had not really lost him and could talk to him whenever
she wished. She seemed to feel, however, that she left him in
the seance room when she went home. It was a pitiful case,
and but for the fact that she could speak to him she would
have committed suicide.
As her grief showed no signs of abating as time went on, I
finally one day said to her: "Lady, you do not seem to get
any consolation from this Truth; why do you keep coming
to me?"
She told me that she longed to have her son come to her
at home: then she could feel that he was with her even when
she was not in the seance room.
I told her that if she had faith and asked God to allow her
son to come to her at home so that she could see him, I be
Experiences of Others 273
«<
lieved that he would be able to do it.
I had become intimately enough acquainted with her, from
her sittings with me, to be fairly certain that she had sufficient
psychic power for this to take place.
That night while lying in bed and sobbing she prayed to
be allowed to see her child. Suddenly he appeared in all the
beauty of his new surroundings and, touching her, begged her
not to cry, because her tears hurt him so. Except for this he
was very happy and wanted her to be also. God had taken him
to a better world, but allowed him to be with her to comfort
and help her.
She came to me and told me what she had seen, and never
wept again.
"Faith can move a mountain" is a saying which is familiar
to all of us. How true this is was demonstrated to me I think
most forcibly by the case of a young couple I was acquainted
with in Chicago. The young man came to my seances rather
frequently, his young wife occasionally. I have seldom met a
more happy or loving couple than this one. They were de
voted to each other, but in spite of this the young woman's
parents, living in Germany, refused to recognize her husband
because of his English descent. Appeals of their daughter fell
on deaf ears. This did not make any particular difference, how
ever, until the time when the young wife developed tubercu
losis and was advised by her doctors to return to her native
Germany. At parting her husband told her that if anything
should happen to her while away, the only thing he wished
was her wedding-ring.
274 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>> ».>.>.>».» >>>.»> >.>.».>.>.>.>.>.»»»-».>>>.».>-> >.
She said that if she thought anything of that sort was going
to happen, she would leave it with him, but he refused this,
saying he wished her to wear it as long as she lived.
His premonition came true. She passed over, her last mo
ments spent in urging her parents to return her ring to her
husband, telling them this was the only thing he was asking
of them. The ring never was sent. In my seances the young
wife told her husband she was trying hard to get her parents
to return the ring, but they were so obstinate she could do
nothing with them. Finally she said: "If you have faith, dear,
I will bring you the ring myself."
I told her not to bring it to him in my seance room, but if
possible to bring it to him in his own home.
For almost a year the young man would sit by himself each
evening for about an hour thinking of his loved one. One
morning he woke up and found the ring on the pillow beside
him. Careful examination proved it to be the ring he had
given her. Much as she may have wished to bring the ring
from Germany to this country to her husband, she would
have been unable to do so had not he had such implicit faith
in her.
Another very loving couple living in Chicago were entirely
unacquainted with Spiritualism. They meant everything to
each other, but finally the time arrived when the young man
had to join his friends on the Other Side. His wife was in
consolable.
Both had led spiritual lives, and after a time power was
given to the man to show himself to his wife, to console her
Experiences of Others 275

and to prove to her that she really had not lost him. He ap
peared one night as she was lying in bed, weeping in her lone
liness.
"My dear, God has been kind to both of us; he has given
me power to show myself to you so that you will know I am
not lost to you or even separated from you by any distance."
She was overjoyed and begged him to come to her often.
"That I cannot do, darling, because you are not a medium.
God has allowed me to come this time, but it will occur very
seldom. It is necessary for me to have an instrument before I
can come whenever you wish me to and this instrument is
called a medium. I will help you to find one, and then we can
talk to each other whenever you visit the medium.
"God bless you, and remember I am with you all the time."
He disappeared, leaving his wife filled with a new-born
hope and the realization her beloved had not been lost to her.
She never had heard of a medium before, but her husband
had told her to find one, and next morning she began so early
and searched so diligently that before evening she had my
address.
She came for a sitting. The first message her husband gave
her was to remind her of his visit two days before and to re
peat what he had said then.
All of this was a most beautiful experience for a despairing
woman and shows what the Spirit World can do for us if we
live spiritual lives, developing our psychic powers.
One woman who came to me occasionally for a sitting lived
some two hundred miles away. She had been endowed
276 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>->>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
naturally with considerable psychic strength and not infre
quently would have some beautiful experience in her home.
One night she had what she at first took to be a dream.
She seemed to see a neighbor's girl, a close friend of her own
daughter, struggling in a river. She became weaker and
weaker and finally sank beneath the surface. Then the woman
seemed to find herself three miles down-stream in a clump
of bushes which grew out into the water. Looking down,
she saw the body of this girl caught among the branches.
She woke with considerable uneasiness and wondered what
the meaning of her "dream" could be. The thought came to
her that it was a vision, but she could not interpret it.
Three days later, in the afternoon, word was brought to
her that her daughter had drowned herself in the river. In
stantly she remembered her vision and told them that they
would find the body three miles down-stream, caught in some
bushes. She described the spot clearly. There the body was
found, just as it had been shown to her by the Spirit World.
I have related these few instances of people having had
beautiful spiritual experiences when alone, with no medium
present, as another answer to those critics who maintain that
the medium produces the phenomena coming through the
seance room by physical means and who deny any spiritual
agency.
Most of my readers undoubtedly have had personal ex
periences of this nature or have intimate friends who have
been so fortunate and are aware of the help and consolation
given to them by their friends in Spirit by this means. I

don't believe any of these will wish to subscribe to the ex
planation offered by some critics of these phenomena—namely,
that they are hallucinations —because a normal person is quite
well aware that he is not mentally defective and rightfully
resents any such implication from some person his manifest
inferior in spiritual development. Resentment is fully justi
fied when a person on such a low plane that he is unable to ex
perience or appreciate beautiful spiritual phenomena comes
up to one who can and says: "It is all bunk; you are just a little
crazy, that is all. You only thought you saw and heard a spirit,
because I know that you did not."
The fact that Sir William Crookes, the great scientist, held
long conversations with the spirit of Katy King, danced with
her, and had many other Fellows of the Royal Society present
when she manifested, and clipped a lock of her auburn hair,
which remained in the material after she had returned to the
spiritual, meant nothing to his critics.
They had nothing to say about Katy King, but much to say
about Home, the American medium, whom they accused of
being a magician. They centered their criticism on the physi
cal manifestations of Home. They left out of consideration
entirely the oft-materialized spirit of Miss King, or the fact
that the child medium Florence Cook, entranced and in an
adjoining room, could be seen clearly while Miss King mani
fested. They overlooked the fact that she told who she was
in this world, and where she had lived in India, and that in
vestigation proved every statement to be true.
There is nothing one-sided in this relationship between us
and our loved ones on the Other Side. Our co-operation in the
278 The Voice Triumphant
>».>».».>>>» >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ».»»
form of faith and earnest endeavor is absolutely essential in
their work of helping us. Faith is a law of God and has not
been made by us or our Spirit friends.
Lack of faith and an antagonistic attitude are the funda
mental reasons for the negative results obtained by many offi
cious investigators of psychic phenomena. They set out with
the attitude: "I know this is not true and that the results are
faked and to prove it to the gullible mortals who believe in it
will do some investigating. My negative results will show
them they are fools to believe in anything of the sort."
Man-made laws may be evaded to a certain extent, but
God's laws cannot. When God made laws which say that like
attracts like and that faith and a belief in Him are necessary
in order to communicate with those in Spirit, no mortal is
going to change them just because he wishes to. Negative re
sults are inevitable to such a person and prove nothing. No
true scientist puts any belief in negative results. Scientists, be
cause of their training and life spent in earnest investigation
and research into the unknown, are better qualified to judge
what constitutes proof of any question than any other class
and they never accept negative results as proof. For untrained
and insincere meddlers to do so and then be allowed to scat
ter this misinformation broadcast through the columns of cer
tain types of newspapers is really an insult to the intelligence
of thinking people.
For these same "investigators" to assert they can reproduce
by trickery certain spiritualistic phenomena also proves noth
ing. The fact that a reconstructed ruby can be made so nearly
like the natural stone that only an expert can tell the differ
Experiences of Others 279
<.
ence does not prove that the natural stone does not exist. The
reproduction of the appearance and movements of an amceba
by a drop of oil in certain solutions does not prove that a real
amoeba does not exist. Many results in every field can be ob
tained by more than one means. To show that two plus three
makes five does not prove that four plus one does not make
the same thing.
Do I hear someone say: "Why, such things are so foolish
they are childish! Anyone knows that imitations, no matter
how good, can never prove that the genuine does not exist"?
Foolish, yes, but that is exactly the sort of "proof" pre
sented by most critics of Spiritualism. They rely, apparently,
on the mistaken belief that few people are able to reason and
will detect the absurdity of their argument. Personally I have
found people, even those who have not had the advantages
of schooling and are usually considered by certain classes of
people to be ignorant, to be very intelligent and able to rea
son clearly when they can be aroused to make the effort. When
they do not reason thus, it usually is due to lack of trying, not
to lack of ability.
Even at their best, magicians reproduce only the simpler
physical phenomena, and their work can be recognized by an
expert any time. They never have reproduced, and never will,
the consolation brought by the Spirit Forces to a sorrowing
mother in the form of her loved and loving child. The su
preme anxiety of the little one to greet its grieving mother
and to prove to her its continued existence, once heard, never
can be forgotten and cannot be reproduced by any magician's
black art. Their few attempts of this kind have been such
s
280 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
palpable trickery that they would be laughable if they were
not so tragic to the person being victimized.
In the next chapter I shall discuss another class of people,
those who attempt to force the production of spiritual phe
nomena in the absence of a medium. They seek to command
the Spirit World and God, although often they do not realize
this. Magicians seek to duplicate by trickery the true spiritual
marvels; the other class tries to produce the genuine. Both
cause a great deal of harm, not only to themselves, but to the
world in general, by giving it a false picture of the religion
which can do so much good for it.
Psychic power and some degree of spiritual development
are necessary in order to experience these manifestations of
our loved ones in the absence of a medium. It is by means of
the special power belonging to a medium alone that communi
cation in the true sense can be had. The other experiences come
seldom and never at any particular time nor just when we
may wish them. They are possible only when great love unites
the mortal with his Spirit friend or when some task must be
performed.
I shall leave this subject with the reminder to my readers
that one of the strongest supports of the doctrine of communi
cation with those who have passed over comes from beautiful
experiences the individual, unacquainted with Spiritualism,
has, possibly only once in a lifetime, when no other mortal
person is present.
>>»>>>>>>>>>».>»>>>>>.<
QUESTION VERY FREQUENTLY ARISING, ESPECIALLY IN THE
A^-minds of those who recently have become acquainted with
Spiritualism and convinced of its truth, is: "Should I sit for
development?"
This always can be answered in the affirmative, but all the
conditions connected with it first must be learned and the
proper attitude adopted.
Many sincere people acquire the desire to have frequent
physical evidence of their loved ones' presence in the absence
of a medium. In other words, they wish to be mediums them
selves. This desire is legitimate and easily understandable,
but, as I have said elsewhere, mediums are born, not made.
The power possessed by certain individuals which those in
Spirit can use to manifest their presence in a temporal way
has been given by God and cannot be obtained from any other
source. No amount of "development" can bring it to others.
This fact is apparently unknown, or ignored, by the numerous
clergy who say that if there was any communication between
those in Spirit and those on earth, it would take place through
"God's anointed" —themselves, in other words. They say
that God would never let it come through any of the laity.
24
SITTING FOR DEVELOPMENT
281
282 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>.>>
This is very true, the only question being who are the anointed.
God never selected the majority of them for the posts that so
many of them are not fitted for. They selected themselves
and all their "calls" and "anointments" are man-made, not of
divine origin. Those really selected by God to be the spiritual
leaders and teachers of men are the mediums, the ones to
whom He actually gives the power which the higher souls can
use to bring knowledge, love, and consolation to the earth
folks. Setting oneself up as a religious leader and arrogating
spiritual knowledge and divinity does not obtain it for one
and does not enable the higher Forces to use one to manifest
their presence and their love.
Likewise, people with little spiritual development who set
themselves up as mediums and claim this God-given power
when it is not theirs do not obtain
it,
no matter what their
claims are or what they think. The greatest force Spiritualism
has to combat comes, not from its critics or the selfish folk
who fear its liberating knowledge, but from those who, pro
fessing
a
belief
in
it,
do not really understand it.
It
is
a
con
stant occurrence to have
a
new-comer, just beginning to com
prehend what sources of beauty and love have been opened
up to her or him through communicating with Spirit friends,
say: "I wish to be able to talk at home with my loved ones;
why can
I
not be
a
medium myself?"
From the love they bear her, her friends
in
Spirit may some
night give her
a
beautiful vision as she lies in bed. Instead
of accepting
it
with thankfulness and praying that she will be
so favored again, she immediately gets the idea that she
is
a
medium. Hurrying to some medium who may not have
a
Sitting for Development 283

great deal more development than herself, she tells her story
and promptly is told she is a wonderful psychic and should sit
for development.
She immediately "sits" and does not even wait for the
length of time it takes a serious-minded hen to hatch a brood
of chickens before she is "controlled." Stamping her feet, with
loud mouthings she claims that a "spirit" is trying to control
her to give an important message. More mouthings, then she
announces that John has just passed over to Spirit. All the
listeners then think of every John they ever heard of, but out
of the dozens they recall, they cannot find one who has passed
within the last five years. When this opinion finally is arrived
at, she then tells them she was controlled by an undeveloped
spirit and made to give a false message.
This is a sad, sad commentary on the spiritual development
and mental and moral integrity of one who claims beautiful
Spiritualism as her religion. That I am not exaggerating I will
show by two cases below. I have encountered this condition so
many hundreds of times that I have had difficulty in narrow
ing my selection down to two cases, but I feel that they will
be enough to illustrate my point.
Some years ago in Chicago three young women, living to
gether, attended a few of my seances. Soon they decided to be
mediums, purchased a ouija board, and began to get "mes
sages." It was wonderful! The rapid development of their
power truly was marvelous! It was not long before they were
"told" that a sister of one of them recently had passed over
in Colorado and that they should go to the depot at two o'clock
284 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■>■>■>>>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>■>>>>>>>>>
the next day to receive her body. They were there at two
o'clock, but no body came. Returning home, they consulted
their ouija board and were told to go next day at two o'clock.
The result was the same. This happened three times. The last
time they found that no train came from Colorado within sev
eral hours of two o'clock.
Finally they decided to call me up and ask for an explana
tion. One girl telephoned me and told me that they had re
ceived word to meet the body of the sister of one of them, but
had failed to find any body after three attempts. She wanted
me to ask the Guides what all this meant.
As she made no mention of the source of her "message," I,
without giving the matter any particular thought, assumed
they had had a letter or telegram and went into the seance
room for advice. Pat told me he already had been to Colorado
and had found the girl whose body they were looking for
healthier and happier than she ever had been before. She was
writing a letter to her sister at the time and this should be re
ceived the following Friday morning. Pat said they surely
were mixed up somehow.
I phoned them what Pat had told me.
They seemed doubtful, but with Friday came the letter.
All three came over that afternoon to see me, and then it was
that I learned the source of their previous "messages."
For their own good I took them to task for thinking they
could receive messages from the Spirit World by themselves
when none of them were mediums and none of them under
stood even the fundamentals of the law of communication.
They were playing with forces about which they knew noth
Siding for Development 285
<.
ing. Was I teaching them anything? They informed me that
an undeveloped spirit had controlled the ouija board and
given the false messages. They knew more about it than I
did and could give me information which my Guides could not.
The second case shows how badly a person can be mis
judged and how much misunderstanding can be caused by
these so-called "messages."
One summer I paid a visit to a family in the Catskills. They
claimed to be Spiritualists and had attended several of my
seances in New York. Upon their invitation I went to their
home for a few days. There I found out that the woman was
developing into a great medium. In fact, I was informed con
fidentially by her husband that she was going to have the
power to get the Voices in the light whenever she held a se
ance. Darkness would not be at all necessary for one with her
strength. A true medium always can recognize another me
dium without any words being exchanged, but I failed to sense
any mediumistic power about any member of this family. To
make sure, however, I asked my Guides and was told that not
only were they not mediumistic, but they were not even true
Spiritualists. They believed in its phenomena, but refused to
learn anything about its laws. They were well satisfied with
their own interpretation and their own ideas.
The next year I had occasion to go to New York on a busi
ness trip and just before leaving mailed a short note to this
family telling them I was starting for New York. I over
looked saying anything about the probable length of my
visit.
286 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.».>>»>>>>»>>>>>>>>>>»>•
I remained just two days and then returned in the company
of a friend.
About a month later I received a letter from the man to
whom I had sent the note and most properly was upbraided
for remaining in New York for three weeks, holding seances
for many people during that time, and then not being grate
ful enough for their hospitality of the year before even to pay
them a week-end visit.
I could not understand his letter at all, but further corre
spondence developed the fact that through his wife's "medi-
umistic" power they had been informed of all these happen
ings and it was not until I told him to write to the friend who
had accompanied me home, to verify my statement that I
had been in New York only two days, that he admitted their
"message" might not have been correct. He informed me
then that they had just received another one through his
wife which informed them that an evil spirit had given the
first!
It is quite evident that no "evil spirit" would have given
that message to the woman had I mailed them another note
on my arrival home, telling how short my stay had been. There
seems to be but one possible source for such "messages"—the
mind of the person giving them. Would that I could make
so clear to these people the harm they are doing to them
selves and to the cause they claim to support that they would
cease their imaginings and pray to God for spiritual enlighten
ment and for whatever benefits it is right and proper for them
to receive! Then would they truly develop and be a credit
to themselves and their religion.
Sitting for Development 287

These imaginary messages and the illogical behavior of so-
called mediums have done infinitely more harm to the cause
of Spiritualism than any outside agency. Thinking people
coming into contact with cases such as these cannot fail to form
a poor opinion of the religion professed by such foolish indi
viduals. If this is the aspect of the religion which they en
counter first, they cannot be blamed if they search no further
in Spiritualism for the help and consolation of which they are
in need. In fact, nearly all the criticism directed against our
cause is based on such incidents. Our opponents, however, are
at great pains to publish and emphasize this feature and cover
up the good and the genuine parts with which they also are
acquainted. They should be fair enough to admit that Spirit
ualism should no more be condemned for incidents such as
these than Jesus should be blamed for all the atrocities
committed in His name by the Inquisition. We cannot ex
pect this; neither can we afford to indulge in self-pity. It
strictly is up to real Spiritualists to clean their own house until
it is beyond criticism, and not waste time and energy blam
ing their critics for the disrepute in which the world holds
them.
It is my advice that all such things as ouija boards, plan-
chettes, automatic writing, messages on slates, card-reading,
crystal-gazing, and so forth be let strictly alone, unless by a
highly developed medium, because more harm than good
comes from them. There being no such thing as an evil spirit,
the false messages come only from the operators deluding
themselves. They are playing with Forces they know nothing
about, and no good can come from such a pursuit.
288 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>».>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Perhaps my reader now is wondering why I said at the be
ginning of this chapter that it always is right to sit for develop
ment, proper conditions being present. I will explain.
It is a fact that many persons possessing mediumistic power
are unaware of it and could develop into mediums under
proper conditions, but the majority are not so fortunate. One
may have a strong desire to become a medium, and it is quite
proper to try to find out whether the power lies there undevel
oped. After learning the laws governing mediumship and
other natural laws such a person may sit for development un
der the supervision of a strong medium in a sincere effort to
find out whether the power is present. If it
is,
the evidence
soon will come unmistakably.
If
it
is
not there, no evidence
will be seen and
it
is
very wrong and shows an entire lack of
understanding of God's laws then to imagine oneself "con
trolled."
Few have mediumistic power, but all have some spiritual
development. Everyone has
a
soul and
a
conscience. Probably
the majority of people, certainly all who live
a
clean life, per
forming their daily labor with love and thankfulness, have
sufficient psychic power to receive impressions and ideas from
their friends
in
Spirit and once in
a
great while to have
a
beau
tiful spiritual experience. All this, spiritual development, the
voice of the conscience, psychic power, and spiritual experi
ence, can be advanced and strengthened
by
proper sitting in
loving concentration upon God and one's friends on the Other
Side, praying that whatever
is
right may be given.
Do not expect results that only
a
medium could obtain, do
not be disappointed and discouraged when they do not come.
Sitting for Development 289
<
Fifteen minutes a day spent sitting quietly and peacefully,
sending out loving thoughts to friends on both sides of the
boundary, offering prayers for those in need of help, asking
for spiritual knowledge and guidance, will bring a wealth of
return in happiness and increased appreciation of the beauty
of earthly life. The soul's development will be proceeding
markedly even though physical evidence of it may not be seen
immediately. Beautiful spiritual experiences probably will
come more frequently. Help and assistance when in difficulty
will be given promptly and strikingly from one's Guides. The
wonderfully sustaining feeling of the all-pervading power of
the Spirit World will be felt strongly, giving whatever
strength is necessary to meet any trying situation. Without
being able to bring to one's friends any manifestations possible
only by a medium, nevertheless one may so develop oneself
that personal difficulties and troubles can be solved and over
come promptly and easily and a happiness on earth attained
which is possible only to those living close to their God and
their Guides.
There is another benefit produced by the loving thoughts
sent out during these little sittings which is seldom realized or
understood. Several times I have mentioned the power for
good or for harm possessed by thoughts. Good thoughts help
the soul, wrong thoughts harm it. I also have said that wrong
thoughts can harm no one but their author. They have no
effect on the one to whom they are directed. All this is per
sonal.
The power, in addition to this, can have a mass effect. This
I have seldom heard mentioned or discussed except by the
290 The Voice Triumphant
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
Guides of the Stead Center. They teach us that all the selfish,
vindictive, jealous, and wrong thoughts sent out all over the
world accumulate until they are cleared away by some calam
ity. Sometimes it is a storm, sometimes an earthquake; usually
it is a war. Whatever it
is,
it
is
necessary
in
order to clear away
the baneful influence which
is
holding the people away from
love and happiness.
In
a
similar way all good thoughts sent out benefit not
only their author personally, but accumulate to benefit all
others as well. Be we, then, either utterly selfish or supremely
altruistic, we should be the parents of nothing but loving
thoughts of which we justly may be proud.
Sitting for development when
it
is
done
in
love and with
a
clear understanding of its object
is
a
most potent means of
gaining understanding and happiness.

CLIMBING
On the lowest round of the ladder
I firmly planted my feet,
And looked up at the dim vast distance
That made my future so sweet.
I climbed till my vision grew weary,
I climbed till my brain was on fire,
I planted each footstep with wisdom,
Yet I never seemed to get higher;
For this round was glazed with indifference,
And that one was glazed with scorn,
And when I grasped firmly another,
I found under velvet a thorn;
Till my brain grew weary of planning
And my heart's strength began to fail,
And the flush of the morning's excitement,
Ere evening, commenced to pale.
But just as my hands were unclasping
Their hold on the last gained round,
When my hopes coming back from the future
Were sinking again to the ground,

One who had climbed near the summit
Reached backward a helping hand,
And refreshed, encouraged, and strengthened,

And I wish —oh! I wish—that the climbers
Would never forget as they go
That, though weary may seem their climbing,
There is always someone below.

THE OTHER WORLD
HUMANITY
SEEMS HUNGRY FOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAND
beyond the veil, but only when humanity is prepared
for such knowledge can it become universal. It is possible,
however, for us to learn something about the Spirit World,
even though our knowledge never will be complete. Our
friends answer many questions about their world and their
life, but do not answer many more because we could not un
derstand them, nothing on our earth or in our experience
giving us anything with which they could compare their ex
perience. The picture the average man would have of a prob
lem after hearing it stated in terms of calculus would be just
about as clear as the picture we should have of many phases of
life in Spirit if our Guides attempted to explain them to us. Our
understanding would vary according to our previous knowl
edge and prior contact with the subject and also with the
familiarity and advancement of our instructor. Considered
from this point of view, it is not surprising that so many ap
parently different descriptions of life on the Other Side have
been reported.
It is not the purpose of this volume to tell you about the
spheres of Spirit or to enter* deeply into the philosophy of the
293
294 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
teachings. (I hope, however, that you will have gained much
of this rich philosophy, for the facts I tell you have been
given to me from the brighter side of life, and frequently by
teachers who long ago passed into the realms of the beyond
and have made marvelous progress as students and pre
ceptors.) I, therefore, will not attempt a detailed description,
but will confine myself to certain phases of the Other Life
with which I am familiar from occurrences in my seance room.
You may say that you know New York, but do you really
know it? What is it you know —the subways, the elevated
roads, the appearance of streets and buildings, the bay, the
various boroughs? There are students who know New York
for its learning, its libraries, its art treasures, its philosophy.
To them the streets and the subways and the tall buildings
are but incidents. It is the spirit of the city they know. Others
know it as a place where physical pleasures and thrills abound.
They know it for its chummy meeting-places and its excite
ment. Still others know the city for its spiritual treasures. They
find that it has harbors of refuge for weary souls. They realize,
too, that all cities—no matter how large or small —are in
poverty when it comes to the truly spiritual things.
Considering all this, you will not be surprised to hear those
from the Other Side tell you, variously and depending upon
their experience, that the next world is the same as this world
—or that it is wholly different. The person who is of the earth,
earthly, still sees this world in passing beyond. One who has
lived a spiritual life will comprehend the spiritual beauty of
his new home. We enter the next realm as we leave this one.
We see what we are prepared to see, and not all of us see the
The Other World 295
<.
same things, even in our own neighborhood on the earth plane.
"Why, I am right where I always have been," said one
loved one. "No, there is no other world. It is just this world."
Another says: "Oh, this is gloriously different. We have no
cities such as you have, but parklike cities of great size; beau
tiful and palatial homes; such flowers—of a beauty and per
fume and variety beyond description!"
In a similar way one might variously describe New York.
A person living in the lower East Side squalor might say:
"Oh, New York is crowded and filthy and miserable." One
residing on Park Avenue probably would observe : "New York
is majestic and splendid beyond words." They speak of the
same city, but unless we knew it to be the same one, we should
have no way of so recognizing it.
To write about a world that is different from ours and yet
coincident with it is asking humanity to believe something
that the corporeal senses cannot grasp. I wonder, however, if
it is half so important to know what the worlds to come are
like (for there are successive stages of progress—all eternity is
progressive) as it is to find out how to be happy here and to
prepare for genuine achievements later on. In the life beyond
ours the state of spiritual development is of greatest impor
tance; locale is of smaller moment. How well the spiritual
growth is faring is vital. There discerning of the state and
stage of spiritual progression is clearer than it possibly could
be in this world and much more important than the region
where it takes place. While a thousand friends may tell us
seemingly a thousand different stories about their world, they
are only different interpretations, none of which could possibly
296 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
be a complete description.
To make all this clearer, let us consider translations from
one language to another. Much is lost, because all languages
do not have words that convey just the meaning that was im
plied in the original tongue. Therefore if a book is translated
from English into German, from German into Spanish, from
Spanish into French, from French into Russian, and so on,
much is going to be altered.
Now picture a condition wherein there is no language of
earth that can describe the scenes and facts of the land beyond.
The Bible is filled with parables. Why? Because only through
comparing spiritual with earthly affairs could the lessons be
conveyed. Then there arose the danger of accepting literally
what was intended as a figure of speech.
A similar situation arises in trying to describe the kind of
life that awaits us. The loved ones attempt seriously to picture
to our minds the condition, and we miss it. We are seeking
to think in a language which we do not know. We are trying to
understand something that calls perhaps for organs of under
standing which we do not possess—or, if we do, which still
are asleep, or not in use. It is as though one expected an egg to
function as a bird while it still is an egg. Consequently, with
these many efforts to describe conditions wholly unlike any
thing we have in this world, the dear ones do the best they
can. The sum total is a collection of seemingly different de
scriptions. They are merely different interpretations —first,
from those in various stages of progress; second, to those in
various stages of development.
If organs had one hundred thousand keys, the variety of
The Other World 297
«-<. <«- <<«- <<
airs to be played would be beyond counting. The world to
come is as much an improvement over this, if we are devel
oped to behold
it,
as the instrument with one thousand keys
would be over the organs which we know.
To live each day to the best of our ability
is
task enough.
We need not worry what the next world or worlds may look
like. We shall see them one after another as we are prepared
to view and understand them. Worlds at best are only set
tings for the most precious things
in
God's great kingdom —
living souls!
Let us consider, however,
a
few views of the Other World:
first that of the spirit newly passed over who knew nothing
about the world to come, but who lived an upright life while
on this earth. To such
a
one his passing
is
so natural and the
world he sees seems so familiar that there appears to be no
difference. There of course
is
a
difference, and
a
marked one,
in the fineness of vibration there, the peacefulness, harmony,
and understanding, although to
a
casual observer this may
not be immediately evident, and we can say that
in
physical
appearance parts of the Spirit World may be so much like ours
that one who passes over often finds everything so natural
that he does not know he has passed. He continues to go about
his business on earth
in
ignorance of any change and wonders
why his mortal friends no longer pay any attention to him.
He sees his neighborhood and his home as he always has seen
them and, looking about him, sees
a
world which seems
merely
a
continuation and part of the one he has left, and he
realizes only
by
degrees that there has been any change. As
he meets and talks with friends and relatives whom he long
298 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
has considered "dead," it gradually dawns on him that some
thing must have happened. He may not believe them at first
when they tell him what it is and returns to his mortal en
vironment only to find his friends there no longer heed him.
He may become even a little incensed with them for a while
and unbraid them for their discourtesy, but finds he gets no
response. Often his friends in Spirit find they can enlighten
him most easily by taking him to his own funeral. As he views
his mortal body and realizes he himself no longer is a part of
it,
he recognizes the truth.
To show how natural the Spirit World appears to
a
person
in this situation
I
will tell about the landlord of
a
friend of
mine. This woman, whom
I
had known for several years, was
a
physician and occupied
a
house the upper floor of which she
used as an office and consulting-room. Her landlord was
a
fine
old German, very thrifty, and in spite of being quite well off
always collected his rents personally. He came around
promptly on the first of every month and expected all his
tenants to be as punctual with their payments as he was with
his visits.
My friend had occupied this house for about two years when
one day, as she was treating
a
patient upstairs, she heard
a
loud crash.
It
sounded to her as though someone had bumped
into her dish cupboard and knocked
it
over. Rushing down
stairs, she found the cabinet and dishes unharmed and, look
ing over the whole floor, could find nothing out of place. Con
siderably puzzled, she finally returned to her patient, but no
sooner had she seated herself than she heard further knocks,
The Other World 299
<. < <. ««< < <. ««< <. ««< ««<
and footsteps coming up the stairs. Out of the room she hur
ried again, but could find nothing wrong anywhere in the
house.
The next morning she heard loud noises all over the place
and decided to come to me to ask me what I thought of the
matter.
Laughing, I said: "Yesterday was the first of the month,
wasn't it? Maybe your landlord has passed over to Spirit, but
came to collect the rent just the same."
I do not know what prompted this idea, but it occurred to
me as soon as she started to speak.
"Why, yes, it was the first of the month," she replied; "I
had forgotten about it because my landlord never came. He
always is punctual, almost to the hour."
We entered the seance room a few minutes later and were
greeted by Pat. "Yes, your landlord passed to Spirit three
days ago, but does not know it yet. His friends cannot convince
him that he has done so, and because your rent was due yes
terday, he came to collect it. You paid no attention to him and
he did his best to let you know he had come for the money.
His funeral takes place today and we are going to take him
to see them bury his body. I believe that will convince him and
you will hear no more noises at home."
When my friend returned, she inquired of her neighbors
and found out that the man had passed over and was being
buried that afternoon. After the funeral she heard no more
noises about her home.
Another case involved an artist whom I never had met on
300 The Voice Triumphant
> >»».>.> >>>>>>> >.».>> >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >».>.>.»
the earth plane. He was a friend and the employer of the
artist Charley, who saw "Red" on Dearborn Street, whom I
have told about elsewhere. Charley came often to the Center
and one Sunday evening had two friends with him, both of
whom I knew. The seance began and the opening hymn was
sung. As it ended, I saw a tall man standing directly in front
of these three men, a spirit whom I had never seen before. He
was smiling doubtfully at them.
"Well, you're nice guys," he began, "fine friends to let me
stand here like a fool and not even give me a greeting. Say,
what kind of business is this—a Sunday-school? Everybody
sitting around in a circle, some with long faces, some smiling,
and you three fellows with glassy eyes looking right through
me as if you didn't see me. What kind of treatment is this,
anyway?"
"Who is this speaking?" inquired one of the three men.
"Who the dickens do you think it is? Trying to upstage me
this way? Why, even my friend there sits with that same glass-
eyed gaze. What's the matter with you fellows? You think
it's smart, I suppose."
"How did you get here?" asked one of the men.
"How did you get here yourselves? I came every step of
the way with you, sat downstairs with you, came up here and
heard you whispering together, but couldn't quite make out
what you were saying.
"I don't feel sick any more. For two days I have felt well,
only everybody's gone back on me. Nobody I know will talk
to me, excepting a few whom I have not seen for many years,
and they act so queerly. It is said that when a man goes crazy,
The Other World 30 1
<
he thinks everybody else is crazy. Well, I guess I must be off
my axis all right."
"But don't you see anything you never saw before?" que
ried one of the men.
"No! Say, I go around and slap my good friends on the
back till my hand stings, and they never so much as pass the
time of day with me. That's all right, though; I always paid
my bills and people don't have to talk to me if they don't want
to. Only —I don't like it. I am as good as they are, as good as
any one of you three. In fact, I think I am as good as all of
you put together."
"Are you talking through the trumpet?" they asked him.
"The trumpet? Do you mean that tin horn standing over
there? Say, that's all well enough for the men who call taxis
after the theater, but I am talking, am I not? Do men talk
through tin horns? There is that silly little pan of water on
the floor; and that blonde sitting here in the middle of this
strange gathering. I suppose she thinks she is queen of the
May, doesn't she? There's a grinning Irishman standing by
her [my Guide Pat] who seems to think this is a great joke.
Well, it isn't."
"Fred, how do you travel around?"
"Just as I always did, mostly in street-cars and on the L.
Only that is funny: I get by without paying my fare! Funniest
thing you ever heard of. They never give me a tumble. One
fat woman today sat down on my lap. Seemed as if she sank
right into me. I thought everybody would laugh, but they
paid no attention to
it.
I
got up, and maybe
I
didn't bawl her
out, but the big fat hussy never even begged my pardon. Nice

»>>»>>>»>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>
way to steal a gentleman's seat!"
"Where do you sleep?"
"Oh, what a lot of goofy questions. Say, where do you sleep
yourself? Out in the garage, I suppose. Well, I sleep in my
bed, where I always sleep. I guess my wife is sore at me
though, for some reason. She just cries. I haven't been around
home much lately."
"You never were—very much," his artist friend murmured.
"Is that so? Well, I'll say this: I don't care for a drink any
more, or even to smoke since I got well. Funny how these
things left me—just like ideas, or dreams, that weren't there
after I got better."
"Well, Fred," one of the men finally said bluntly, "you
don't suppose you probably died?"
"Oh, of all the star-spangled idiots. When a guy dies, he
is dead, isn't he? Do I talk like a dead one? You boys are get
ting funnier all the time."
"But, Fred," the man insisted, "you go home tonight and
look all around and see what you can find. Then learn what
takes place at your home tomorrow at twelve thirty. Will you
do that?"
"Sure, if you'll speak to me later."
"I'll speak to you right here again tomorrow night."
"I suppose the blonde will be here again, with her silly
little pan of water and those two tin horns, and that laughing
Irishman, and the others. Say, some of the others are peaches.
Nobody I ever saw before can compare with them. I don't care
so much, though, for a bunch of the others standing around
giving me broad smiles or outright laughs. I am getting
The Other World 303
<
blamed tired of that kind of treatment. Yes, I'll spend a few
hours around home and let you know what I find out."
The friends bade him farewell, but before he left, he said
briskly: "Say, there is one mighty funny thing. I was down
town today, over to the office on Dearborn Street, and then
walked down State Street. I saw twice as many people as
Chicago ever had before, and blame me if some of them don't
walk right through the buildings! They don't even stop to
go through the doors !
"
In later seances this man admitted that he guessed he must
have passed through a change known as death, but he still
did not grasp it all. As the days passed, he began to see what
might be called an additional view of the world. Things looked
differently to him, he met friends whom he recalled as having
"died." He began to find himself and his work. He ceased
wandering the streets. He had great love for his friends, and
those who remained behind in this material sphere were able
to help him just as much as those whom he met on the Other
Side. Little do we know how greatly we can assist friends who
have passed beyond !
For some time he came through in my seances even when
none of his earth friends were present. He showed remarkable
development; naturally, he was a bright man. In this world
he had been a rough sort of person, evidently not choice in his
language, but he was possessed of a mind above the average.
It is not easy for many people to understand that one enters
Spirit as one has lived. The tree lies as it falls, says both Holy
Writ and an adage of the ages.
Finally he found his work. His loitering days were over. It
304 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.>
is no more all holiday time there than it is here. There is work
to do. Artists here are still artists yonder, some devoting their
time to a finer and higher development of their talent, and
others impressing young and aspiring artists in this world.
Whence come these inspirations of artists and literary folk:
Do you know that many a novel has been written through the
hand of an earthly author, without passing through that per
son's brain? The writer may sit and watch in amazement as
a pencil forms the words, not knowing what is to come next.
Does this come direct by Divine Inspiration, or does God
work through His children? We know in this world, for ex
ample, that a farmer plants his seed in the ground and tends
it carefully. It is not God who miraculously causes the empty
field suddenly to yield a bountiful crop. Man does his work.
Man beyond the grave is man still and does his work in much
the same way, the difference being that he is a trifle freer, and
open to greater possibilities of development.
It took our artist friend some days to realize that he had
passed through the transition. Those who will understand the
reality when it comes through contemplation of this true
story, but who may never have the privilege of similar seance
experiences, still will have gained much. When they have
entered the next expression of life, these truths will come
home to them. They will know what has occurred.
Men such as this artist, once they have begun to learn more
about the beautiful philosophy of life on the brighter side,
become great helps to those whom they can impress on the
earth side of life. Many a "change of heart" has come through
the whispered impression of some dear one beyond the veil
The Other World 305
<
who is opening the spiritual eyes of a loved one in the flesh.
There are more true wonders in life than we ever could re
count or correctly guess, and every one of them is for the
express benefit of the children of the Creator.
Let us now consider some of the differences between the
Other World and ours.
The famous scientist Einstein speaks of the fourth dimerif-
sion, which consists of time plus distance. These he re
gards, I believe, as artificial quantities, and if he does, he is
more nearly correct than he probably surmised when he
voiced his famous theory that few people are supposed to
grasp.
To illustrate, there is the experience of a man who came to
me for many years, beginning about 1909. One day at his
sitting he was conversing with his sister and casually asked
about his mother, living in Sweden.
"She was all right the last time I saw her," the sister re
plied, "but wait—"
Other loved ones then came and greeted him, and he was
unmindful of his sister's absence until she returned.
"Mother," she reported, "is sitting in the chair that father
gave her, spinning linen thread."
"When?" he asked in surprise.
"Now," his sister answered him.
"But Sweden is thousands of miles away, and you were
gone just a few minutes," he protested. "What kind of
transportation do you have there?"
"Brother," the dear one replied, "on a clear night, when
306 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
there are no clouds and there is no moon, you gaze up at the
heavens and see countless millions of stars, and yet many of
them are billions and trillions of miles away from you. You
see them, nevertheless."
"Oh, certainly," he replied, "but there is nothing to obstruct
the view of the stars, they are great in size, and they emit
their own light. Mortals, on the other hand, are small, and
distance has to be traversed. How can you do it?"
"As easily as you see those countless stars we see our dear
ones and others on earth. It is not simple to explain. There is
nothing in your experience that permits me to explain. You
could not understand, because you have dormant faculties
about which you know absolutely nothing. Yet we do these
things easily."
Why should we doubt? In our own time we have witnessed
the results of many remarkable inventions. Still others are to
be revealed and today are known in Spirit. They must be
known there before they can be known here. The real build
ing, the actual planning, is all done there. It comes from the
higher to the lower. We simply interpret, but our hands are
guided just as our minds are guided.
Today it is possible to transmit a photograph by wire, or
even without wires, no matter what the distance on earth. Is
that any more remarkable than to learn that the dear ones
have the use of faculties that are denied us? They have facili
ties, "senses," and properties about which we know nothing.
In those respects they are different from us. In that degree
there is a great change after "death." Even the murderer who
is electrocuted recognizes that a tremendous change has come
The Other World 307
<
over him, and that he did not die. Nor could the one he mur
dered have died. He has disturbing as well as sustaining
thoughts.
Times beyond counting, my Guides and other dear ones
attracted to my seance room have made these hurried trips—
often half-way round the world—and accurately reported what
was occurring.
In the final weeks of the World War almost daily sitters in
my seance room received accurate reports of the fighting and
of the true condition of things—long before those facts were
made known to the outside world.
I recall distinctly in late October 191 8, during a private sit
ting of a gentleman, the Guides said: "We really have so
much to do on the battle-fronts we can't stop to talk much.
The Germans are being badly beaten. They are dropping
by thousands. The casualties are countless. Every available
worker on this side is doing double duty. This is the world's
greatest war, and the largest number ever killed in the same
length of time are coming precipitately into Spirit.
"Many come over still fighting, still filled with the red
anger and hatred and fear of battle. All are disconsolate when
they find that they are removed from dear ones on earth.
However, it soon will be over—very soon, thank God! It is
the most cruel of all human errors—the mightiest of all wars
—but it has nearly spent itself.
"Only, for those who drop in battle, there still is much to
be done. Their poor mortal bodies may be left where shrapnel
or machine-gun fire has mown them down, but we cannot let
them come here unattended. We have hospitals here —and
308 The Voice Triumphant
>.>»>.> ».»»-».»».>.> >>>>>.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
they are filled with those who are struggling to understand.
Those who had limbs amputated are at a loss to understand
why they have their limbs now. Those who were blinded
marvel that now they can see.
"Often we have to keep enemies apart until they have been
calmed and made to understand that on this side of the great
boundary, here where the thought of eternity begins to be felt
seriously and fully, there can be no enmity. All are children of
God. All are friends. All are brothers and sisters through
out eternity."
One thing, evidently, cannot be emphasized too strongly:
that progress on the Other Side is rapid and certain for all
who wish to go forward. They have every possible opportu
nity to realize their desires, and the greater their effort, the
faster and further they go. Almost any man whom you might
question would tell you that of course those existing in any
future life there may be are in a situation superior and better
than we are who remain on earth. Yet almost innumerable
have been the times I have heard wonder and doubt expressed
in the seance room when some loved one has come and spoken
in English instead of the language they used while on earth.
A man offered as proof positive of the incredibility of a mes
sage purporting to be from his mother the fact that the mes
sage was in English! He said his mother could not speak
English on earth. I dare say that he would have resented most
forcefully any implication that his mother was such an igno
rant soul that she was incapable of ambition and the ability to
progress, yet his very statement meant nothing else. Most
The Other World 309
<
people making assertions similar to this have usually been
credited with a lesser mental endowment than was this par
ticular man, but I myself cannot see any great difference.
The desire for progress is the basis of any civilization. With
out that desire man still would be contesting with saber-
toothed tigers for his raw antelope steak. We have advanced
somewhat beyond that stage, and the further we go, the more
rapid is our improvement. It certainly is not reasonable to sup
pose that the labors of countless generations of men have
reached their acme and ceased in our present earthly state.
Surely their work and development must continue when their
souls quit their mortal bodies and find freer and greater ex
pression amid their new surroundings. All earthly evidence
points to continual progress. Progress is parabolic.

THE MEDIUM
FEELING
THAT THERE IS NEED OF AN EXPLANATION ABOUT
a medium's contact with her family and close acquaintances
in daily life apart from the seance room, and feeling that this
should be written from the point of view of the people sur
rounding her, rather than from her own, I have asked a
friend who has attended my seances for the past twenty-two
years to write it. From what he has written it would seem
that a medium was the center about which her associates and
their activities revolve, and the guiding and ruling individual
to whom all must look for instructions. This certainly is not
the feeling a medium has toward those about her, but intimate
contact with her Guides gives her the knowledge of the proper
thing to be done at any time which the others do not have. I
believe that this has been explained clearly below and now
will give his point of view of this relationship.
"The most vital part of Spiritualism, and the least under
stood, is the medium. As far as we on the earth plane are
concerned, she is indispensable and irreplaceable. Without
her we should be unable to communicate with those on the
Other Side and receive the absolutely inestimable help and
3"
312 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
consolation which they are so able and willing to give to us. We
should not know even that there was another phase of life
beyond this one and the change we call death. None of our
great religions would contain its beautiful teachings of a
future life if a medium had not been on earth to give this in
formation to those forming the religion.
"God selects and puts on this earth a soul who is a me
dium. No matter how much we may wish for one or long for
one, we cannot make one. If we need a new lawyer, doctor,
or minister or any other specially trained individual, all we
need do is to pick a young man or woman almost at random
from the street, send him or her for a few years to a good
school, and we shall have a quite acceptable performer. Not
so with a medium. No matter how much the knowledge or
the lack of
it,
no matter how sophisticated or innocent, we can
not make an individual into
a
medium. Years in college mean
nothing,
a
lifetime spent in honest effort to alleviate pain or
relieve want or in teaching what
is
believed to be true in re
ligion cannot accomplish it.
"It behooves us for our own good to study the medium
most carefully and do the utmost
in
our power to help her
in any and all ways that we can. At the best our utmost
is
little enough for the benefits we receive from her, our insensi-
tiveness rendering us slow and unresponsive to both her
mental and her physical needs. Even when trying the hardest
to help, we may say or do something which her exquisite sensi
tiveness tells her
is
not right, and this jangles her nerves as
badly as
a
riveting hammer jangles our ears. She cannot help
this nor control her reaction. In words this censure may offend
The Medium 313
< <- < <- < <
us in our consciousness that we were doing our best to help,
but this offense we take is wrong. If we throw a stone into still
water, we do not become offended because the little waves
and ripplets roughen the mirror-like surface until we no
longer can see our perfect reflection in it. We threw the stone
and we know that we are to blame for the disturbed surface.
All we can do is to wait until the disturbance subsides. In the
case of the medium we can do a little more: we can keep on
trying to help, using more care and intelligence to prevent
doing wrong again and throwing ourselves out of tune with
her.
"In what ways can we help a medium? There are many
ways and I will mention a few.
"In the first place we always should keep our minds tuned
as closely to hers as possible in order that chords and not dis
cords may be struck when the vibrations meet each other. If
we are thinking, ever so slightly, of any disagreeable or un
happy experience, we send out thought vibrations which will
disturb the medium —and she must not be disturbed. She can
not tell what we are thinking about, but she knows that it
clashes with her thoughts, which are in tune with the infinite.
This discord will arouse a positive reaction in her: she may be
short in her greeting or apparently hypercritical of us, but,
whatever the reaction, it has been brought on by us and not
by the medium and we immediately should try to find out
wherein we are out of tune and correct it.
"We can help a medium by surrounding her with beauty
in all its manifestations. Beautiful thoughts cost us nothing
and should be the form of beauty we could surround her with
314 The Voice Tr•iumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>»».>.».>.».>->»»».>»»»»
the most easily, but it seems to be the one form which we do
not give her. Probably because she helps us out of difficulties
so frequently, we fall into the error of coming to her with
nothing but difficulties. Two friends will have words about
some trivial matter; the more trivial it
is,
the more words
there will be unloosed. If both were true Spiritualists, there
would be no words in the first place, nor any misunderstand
ing. If they even had the medium's happiness uppermost in
their minds, as they always pretend to have, they would not
run to her immediately and agitate her with their controversy;
they would settle
it
themselves as speedily as possible. If the
various members of the household cannot decide among them
selves whether two bottles of milk should be purchased or
three, the question
is
laid before the medium.
It
makes no
difference whether she may be sitting
by
herself
in
rapt com
munion with some loved one on the Other Side, or whether
she
is
playing the piano, attempting to bring some of the sub
lime music of the Spirit World to the earth; she must be
interrupted with the burning question of the minute. She
never complains because those around her are incapable of
assisting her
in
her efforts to bring beauty to the earth, but she
is
fully justified
in
resenting interruptions in her own efforts.
"Most people come to the seance room with difficulties to
be solved or sorrow to be alleviated, seldom with bright and
happy thoughts to be exchanged with their Guides.
It
is
not
enough that the medium must listen to all this unhappiness
in her work, but she encounters the same thing with her
friends. Personally
I
am very much afraid that
if
I
were
a
medium
I
should have great difficulty
in
preventing myself
The Medium 315
<
from becoming a pessimist. It must be that the beauty of
thought she sees evidenced in the Spirit World is the force
that saves her from such an unfortunate state. Greater and
much more successful efforts must be made by us who are on
earth to surround our medium with mental harmony.
"Because we fail so signally in surrounding our mediums
with mental beauty and stimulation, we should make up as
much as possible of the deficiency with physical beauty. Per
sonally I advocate very strongly the giving of a definite sum
of money to the medium for each unkind or sordid thought
which comes to us, not with the idea that unkindness or sordid-
ness can be evaluated by any monetary standard or can be
atoned for by such means, but in order that she may have the
opportunity to get at least an iota of physical beauty with this
penance to counteract some of the mental ugliness about her.
I am very much afraid, however, that the average income
would prove entirely inadequate to support such a restitu
tion.
"We should supply her with the very best home that we
possibly can, the most beautiful furnishings, the most attrac
tive grounds. If earthly beauty ever justified itself, it does in
bringing happiness to a medium, who spends her life bringing
spiritual beauty to the earth. Physical attractiveness brings joy
to many of us, but such joy is personal only; it not often is of
a kind that engenders further happiness that we in turn dis
seminate. We are gladdened by the beauty, but seldom are
inspired by it sufficiently to create more of it ourselves. To a
medium, on the other hand, the beauty is of definite and con
crete assistance in her work of bringing happiness to others.
3 16 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>»->.>>.>.>.>.>>>>>>>>>>>>»>>>>>>.»
While she never sits in idle contemplation of it for its own
sake,
it,
together with love and harmony, forms the frame
work upon which she builds.
"Another way
by
which we can help
is
to co-operate with
the medium as much as possible
in
anything she undertakes.
When she expresses an idea or suggests
a
plan of procedure,
we should help her to carry
it
out, not start an argument
by
setting forth our own very inadequate thoughts about the
subject or procrastinate until she believes we are unwilling
to help her. Most of her ideas and plans are suggestions of
those on the Other Side and we should do well to assist to our
utmost in bringing them to consummation, whether we under
stand the reason for them or not. Areason, and
a
very good
one,
is
there or our Spirit friends never would waste their
time giving the thought to us.
"Does someone say here that the medium after all
is
hu
man and must have some human ideas, which may be just as
fallible as the ideas of other mortals? Suppose we assist such
ideas, not being able to distinguish them from those of Spirit
ual origin, and find that our efforts have been for naught?
"Let us grant the existence of such ideas.
It
does not change
in the smallest detail our duty to give complete assistance and
co-operation to her. Failure on our part at any time
is
so dis
concerting and disturbing to her that
it
causes infinitely more
harm than
a
little work which we might possibly do uselessly.
I
have found out, however, that even
if
an idea she has given
us and upon which we have worked proves not of the best, our
Spirit friends through her correct the mistake
by
giving us
the necessary advice and assistance to enable us to change

until the results are of the best. To state this a little differ
ently: you are gambling on a sure thing when you help a me
dium, whether with labor, money, ideas, or anything else. You
cannot lose in the end, no matter whether her ideas are wrong
(and this happens extremely seldom) at the beginning or not.
Whatever the kind of help you give her, it is returned at least
tenfold in some way.
"From a wholly selfish point of view, therefore, mortals
should give to their mediums to the utmost of their means, as
the medium is the source from which they may obtain their
desired happiness. Even though their earthly joy consists
solely in making money—something, of course, which brings
no permanent benefit —the Spirit friends with whom they can
be brought in contact only through the medium can assist them
in achieving this goal. Personally, I am unable to conceive
of any form of normal human happiness which a medium is
not able to assist us in gaining and consequently am of the
firm belief that we cannot acquire our earthly happiness, no
matter what it may be, more easily than by supplying our me
diums with the very best of working conditions, which are, as
I have intimated, beautiful physical surroundings and the
utmost of mental harmony."
Such are the views this man holds of the relationship of a
medium to her intimate friends and to the world at large and
he is correct as far as my experience extends. The people com
ing in contact with a medium often hinder her in her work,
mostly through no conscious fault of their own, but simply
because, they make no effort to cast off the earthy vibrations

with which they surround themselves. A little effort on their
part would do this and put them in much closer tune with God
and the Spirit World, to the great assistance of the medium and
to their own good.

WHEN ALOES BLOSSOM
by Snowdrop
You've suffered? I know, but Christ suffered, too,
As a lesson in patience for such folk as you
Who try and in trying are ever denied;
You've suffered; remember, He was crucified!
You're criticized? Truly, you're not understood,
As few can be ever whose mission is good.
You've been bruised, and risen, to fall once again,
And the love in your heart has brought little but pain?
I understand, and by that token know
That your cup has been filled to o'erflowing with woe.
Christ knelt in Gethsemane, prayed through the night,
Not for Himself, but for all that is right.
You carry a cross? Ah, He carried one, too,
And is sharing the weight of the cross willed to you,
And He leads you each foot of the trail that He trod,
That trail that you'll follow; it's blazed straight to God.
Oh, the years may seem leaden, the aloes may grow;
So bitter the aloes, the emblem of woe,
But the aloes will blossom and happily flower.
Be patient, so patient, for dawn's golden hour!

CONCLUSION
ICOME NOW TO THE END OF MY VOLUME WITH SOME FEEL-
ing of regret—regret that I may not have been able to
explain my teachings and relate my experiences as well as they
should have been. The beauty and the love and the consolation
brought always by our Spirit friends to us from God is beyond
expression. It is felt by the soul, but cannot be described ade
quately. I have done my best, but realize that I have not done
full justice to my subject.
I expect criticism and shall welcome it gladly. All I ask is
that it be given with as sincere a desire to help me as my labor
has been given to help others. Nothing on earth is perfect and
no person is infallible. One may do one's best, but several work
ing earnestly and in harmony may be able to do better.
It has not been my purpose to try to convert my reader to
Spiritualism. Nobody can make a Spiritualist or make anything
else out of you—you make yourself what you are. My attempt
has been to place before my reader as clearly as I have been
able the teachings and the facts given by the higher souls in
their ceaseless labor of love to help humanity live its life on
earth to the fullest. Human mistakes and human sorrow never
will be completely eliminated, but a clear understanding of the
321
322 The Voice Triumphant
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
right and of God's Plan as it applies to us will assist greatly in
correcting the mistakes and assuaging the sorrow. It is inevitable
that earthly death will cause loneliness in those remaining on
earth, and this grief will be in proportion to the love existing
between them. It is at such a time that a sincere belief in com
munication between those on both sides of the veil is priceless.
All religious cant and high-sounding altruistic precepts then
are feeble consolation compared with the simple thought: "My
loved one is beside me and I can talk with him whenever I may
wish to seek a medium." The feeling of loneliness may persist
for a time, but the despair caused by the sense of irrecoverable
loss is not present.
I wish to remind my readers in closing that Spiritualism is a
religion of love and hope and does not countenance teachings of
evil and fear or any others which hold man away from his God
and his just happiness in earthly life. Contrary to other re
ligions, it does not believe that man can be kept in the "path of
rectitude" only by making him run after a sugarplum dangled
in front of him, with the thought of the devil at his heels if he
pauses in his treadmill flight.
Spiritualism has a very much higher concept of man —that
of a soul having a definite place and a duty to perform in God's
Great Scheme of existence. He will avoid error and wrong
doing if he is taught properly what error and wrongdoing are.
He most emphatically is not created with a perverse desire to do
wrong. He has come to this earth with love and in innocence,
and only false teachings have misled him. His religion should
help him by true instructions, not make his path harder by un
true preachments of fear and devilish horrors.
