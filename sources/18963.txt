I&#39;m David Hamilton from the Department
of Energy and my background is basically
nuclear power fuel cell systems and
electric power systems and for the
Department of Energy that&#39;s mainly what
I focus on is new generation power
systems
well the critical thing now I think
everyone&#39;s missing in energy is that we
have designed a world that&#39;s feeds on
oil and those oil supplies are becoming
limited more and more limited just the
other night at the vice president
debates they talked about the problem in
the United States with higher prices had
nothing to do with the oil but in the
ability to process that oil and at 12
million barrels a day which we passed in
July
that&#39;s over seven thousand barrels a
second it&#39;s a tremendous number it&#39;s
hard for people to fathom how much oil
we were using now if we look at what
supply is never before in our history
have we been in a position where supply
and demand would intersect so we&#39;ve
basically been operating as a monopoly
for oil it&#39;s it&#39;s a free product and now
in about ten years we will see the
intersection between supply and demand
so that means we&#39;ll be seriously supply
limited the other things compounding
that and which we have seen lately the
recession in Asia showed a worldwide
slight depression we were slightly
isolated from most of that but now
they&#39;re coming back and again world
prices are going up because demands
going up and we&#39;re going to see that
become even worse I&#39;ve got some curves I
brought with me to demonstrate this but
if you look at where the Asian and and
the the Chinese market people are in
technology compared to where we are
where the UK is they are about our 1920s
technology level when they move up that
curve to try to have as many cars as we
have per capita the demand for oil would
be astronomical because right now the
industrialized nations are only 20% of
the total population our requirement the
the funding from individuals the funding
from governments is necessary to get the
ideas out to get these people that are
thinking outside the box beyond oil to
begin to supply the ideas and to get the
scientists working on those ideas
to wring out all the problems that we
have with these technologies in a timely
manner instead of them sitting on the
fringes for long periods of time well
are some things I know about some things
that can&#39;t really talk about because but
I do know that there are tremendously
impressive weapon systems and and in
energy potential energy systems but I do
I&#39;m not I don&#39;t have access to really
study them the only ones I have had
study five had the fortunate nature to
study things before they were classified
and in that nature I learned a lot about
some of the weapon systems because of my
quantum mechanical background there are
a lot of technologies that have paths
that you can follow through the
literature that suddenly became non
published and you can track publishing
records up to a certain point and then
they just disappear and you can also
track people&#39;s backgrounds to know that
they were working for a company or they
were working for under government
contract during that period and it seems
odd at times
why were they no longer publishing this
seemed to be a passion at one time but
now they&#39;re not publishing in the in the
public forum so I believe that there
were some things developed I&#39;ve talked
to quite a few people around the country
and in Russia as well that have seen
some some very novel technologies and
want to develop them but they
continually have difficulties in trying
to do that now historically if you look
at technologies that have been rather
toward the nature of what people would
describe as free energy machines not
requiring oil but high voltage or other
types of applications that seem to get
more yield than you would get otherwise
similar to a nuclear power plant you put
very few watts in but you get a lot of
watts back out but these energy systems
have historically had problems you may
be familiar with was at Marais his
experiment was round with first row
second World War I can&#39;t remember the
exact timeframe but it was destroyed all
that was lost
and his son never really understood the
full concepts of what he was doing so he
hasn&#39;t been able to reproduce the work
and similarly with working with the
Russian universities they had done what
I consider one of the best gravitational
experiments ever done was at the high
temperature materials laboratory in
Russia now they had done their
experiment off-site and they
demonstrated that that thing could
develop 35% reduction in gravitational
field now we saw that we were very
impressed with it to grab the
gravitational researchers at D OE and I
had them look at it we were all
interested in doing that we would like
to follow up on that to do a second type
of experiment its duplication
reproducibility getting back to the
issues of how do you do good science but
you run into a lot of resistance against
people but in the Russian case it was
even more so when they had when they
were away from this off-site laboratory
it&#39;s across the street from the
University as I understand it the place
was completely ransacked all the
equipment was lost now lucky for us they
had their recordings they had their
video tapes they had the presentation
materials all of that was still intact
but the machine was lost and it was well
as a lot of the other equipment
necessary to duplicate that test it may
have been that there were some mafia
type individuals that were involved
thinking that there might be some profit
in this thing
it was clearly too early there was much
more science and to be done the reason I
was contacted was to develop the theory
behind why that was working and I guess
the last thing would be the government
folks and my Russian friends say that
the part of the government that does
that is no different from the Mafia so
so that complicates the problem but even
further beyond that we have to we have
to completely get away from oil as an as
a fuel because it won&#39;t be there in the
multiple generations behind us and if we
care about humanity as a race we want to
extend we have to do this
now through my work in theory we&#39;ve been
able to show that in well I&#39;ll give you
my first opinion that Einstein made a 1
mistake that he didn&#39;t realize but human
nature makes it a mistake and that was
special relativity the reason is because
special relativity explains things in a
very simple way for most of the things
we see in nature it doesn&#39;t account for
gravity it doesn&#39;t account for
gravitational anomalies it doesn&#39;t
account for any space-time curvature
whatsoever so that I believe is the
reason why general relativity never got
I would say fixed from his terms it
needed more more intense graph graphical
treatment more intense algebraic
treatment in order to explain it
properly and we&#39;re currently doing that
about a hundred and fifty scientists
around the world working on higher
topology mathematics and higher topology
geometric structures that will help
explain that and they do explain many of
the anomalies we have today there is
potential from these systems that we may
be able to coax nature to reorganize and
some people might call this vacuum
energy but energy is all around us if we
matter is energy everything in this room
causes space-time curvature because
everything comes from energy energy
causes space-time curvature what
Einstein showed in 1917 was that a
planet causes it but we also know by e
equals mc-squared that there&#39;s a
relationship to the energy so if we were
to look at the energy it&#39;s it&#39;s around
us everywhere a lot of it is very
unorganized we need to make that energy
coherent and that&#39;s what I feel that the
vacuum energy might offer us how do we
capture that energy focus it into what
we want it to work on and then provide
us the power for whatever we need to do
if it&#39;s going down the road listening to
a radio whatever it is now imagine if if
it&#39;s true that we can use
electromagnetic fields and adjust them
in such a way that they either decode
the list from gravitation or they may
say create a negative gravitational
effect which some astronomical folks
feel that already we see negative
gravitational effects from long range
parts of the universe which we feel that
may be explaining why the universe is
expanding rather than contracting but
again if we can take advantage of these
locally and we can do it without using
tremendous amounts of energy possibly
using the other energy things we were
talking about earlier the freer energy
concepts the vacuum energy then we&#39;ve
got a way to move material in the Z
plane really efficiently and also with
no pollution and that is really critical
I think that technology in itself is
critical because as this population
grows this this little planet gets
smaller and smaller and you know we did
look at LA&#39;s projections and 2050 50
million people I mean right now you have
to ask where are they going to go its we
have some serious problems to face the
other side of the coin on energy issues
is the amount of carbon we throw into
the atmosphere now this has been a an
important aspect of what the Department
of Energy has worked toward is to try to
get cleaner fuels to work with EPA to
work with other people to to try to
reduce the amount of carbon and we can
we can see the effects by the turtle
population sea turtles that get it it&#39;d
have to be in warmer waters to get
certain kinds of fungus and those fungus
growths are becoming more and more
prevalent we see it in the coral the
British government released as well as
Greenpeace released about coral damage
we know that bleaching happens only
because of you the thermal or exposure
to air and in some of these cases they
weren&#39;t exposed to air so it must be the
thermal currents causing these effects
and then we&#39;ve had a record amount of
ice fall off from from both the ice
shelves so these are these are troubling
they I mean 100-foot rise in water is
probably not tremendously concerning to
most people
but if you live under a hundred feet
you&#39;d be pretty concerned about that the
the other problem of how to do that
is is really challenging because if you
look at what we&#39;ve done in the United
States it&#39;s focusing on just ace you
know just just the US and what the
Europeans are doing is focusing on just
them and again we get back to the issue
we&#39;re only 20 percent of the population
we&#39;ve already used half of the available
known fuel and now we&#39;re looking at the
other 80% of the world coming up using
those same technologies and as Tom
mentioned earlier we might well get into
a carbon density that could be
irreversible and there have been quite a
few papers talking about exactly where
that is
it may not be a very calm transition
that that most people expect it may be a
catastrophic change and that really fits
with the fossil record there haven&#39;t
been really calm changes during
extinction phases they were catastrophic
changes that ended up killing large
populations I think it&#39;s going to take a
worldwide effort to get around these
problems it&#39;s going to take an effort
that divorces everyone from fossil fuels
fossil based fuels trying to find every
aspect every avenue we have to create
the electricity we need for most of our
applications in very clean ways now in
order to do that it&#39;s going to take a
tremendous effort now spending that
money by the countries is not a bad
thing it it creates high tech jobs and
over the long run I believe we will
create a lot of high-tech jobs I think
this is a good thing for the world it&#39;s
a good thing for people it&#39;s a good
thing for this human race and we need to
start doing it now before it&#39;s too late
and I am concerned that if we don&#39;t do
something very soon that as again we saw
in the debates the vice presidential
debates any society that begins to be
resource limited it begins to eliminate
the problem stemming that resource
limitation
and I would hate to see us get into the
position or other people come into the
position to want to eliminate us or we
have to eliminate them in order to
continue our lifestyle and that&#39;s why
it&#39;s so important that we start now here
at the Institute for Advanced Studies
one of our main interest is exploring
the possibility of tapping or mining
this vacuum fluctuation
zero-point energy the way we call it
zero point because even if you froze the
universe now and all the way down the
absolute zero our most motion would be
frozen out this energy would still be
there it&#39;s a very fundamental kind of
managing
