THE C O N C U R R EN C E
This Week’s Consideration of a Famous Opinion
V V V
The studies throughout the various Degrees have been
concerned with the knowledge of the fundamental laws of
the universe. Since man is the microcosm, self'knowledge
and self'mastery is of great importance. On this question
of self'mastery and its relationship to what is heavenly,
Kwang'tse, Chinese philosopher and follower of Lao'tse, wrote in the
earlier part of the fourth century B. C.:
He who k.nows the Too is sure to he well acquainted with the principles
( that appear in the procedures of things). Acquainted with those principles,
he is sure to understand how to regulate his conduct in all varying circum'
stances. Having that understanding, he will not allow things to injure him<
self. Fire cannot burn him who is so perfect in virtue, nor water drown him;
neither cold nor heat can affect him injuriously; neither bird nor beast can
hurt him. This does not mean that he is indifferent to these things; it means
that he discriminates between where he may safely rest and where he will
be in peril; that he is trariquil equally in calamity and happiness; that he is
careful what he avoids and what he approaches;— so that nothing can
injure him. Hence it is said ‘W hat is heavenly is internal; what is human
is external.’ The virtue of man is in what is Heavenly. If you \now the
operation of what is Heavenly and what is Human, you will have your root
in what is Heavenly and your position in virtue.
— K W A N G 'TSE, Fourth Century B.C.

Beloved Members, Greetings!
We now continue the story of An Adventure Among the Rosiorucians
by Dr. Franz Hartmann, beginning at a point where we discontinued last
week:
^ Chapter II
.THE MONASTERY
"If you could establish theosophical monasteries, where intellec­
tual and spiritual development would go hand in hand, where a new
science could be taught, based upon a true knowledge of the fundamental
laws of the universe, and where at the same time man would be taught
how to obtain a mastery over himself, you would confer the greatest pos­
sible benefit upon the world. Such a convent would, however, afford
immense advantages for the advancement of intellectual research. The
establishment of a number of such places of learning would dot the
mental horizon of the world with stars of the first magnitude, from
which rays of intellectual light would stream and penetrate the world.
Standing upon a far higher plane than the material scientists of our
times, a new and far greater field than that offered to the latter
would be laid open for investigation and research. Knowing all the
different opinions of the highest accepted authorities, and not being
bound by an orthodox scientific creed, having at their service all the
results of the investigations of the learned, but not being bound to
their systems by a belief in their infallibility, they would be at
liberty to think freely. Their convents would become centres of in­
telligence, illuminating the world; and if their power of self-control
would grow in equal proportion with the development of their intellect,
they would soon be able to enter adeptship."
The Adept had spoken these words with unusual warmth, as if he in­
tended to appeal to my sympathy and to induce me to use my efforts to
establish such convents; there was a look of pity in his eyes, as if
he exceedingly regretted the state of poor ignorant humanity, with
whose Karma he was not permitted to interfere forcibly, according to
the established rules of his Order. I, too, regretted my own inability
to establish such monasteries, and for once I wished that I was rich,
so as to be able to make at least an attempt with one such establish­
ment. But immediately the Imperator saw my thought in my mind, and
said:—
"You mistake; it is not the want of money which prevents us to ex­
ecute this idea; it is the impossibility to find the proper kind of
people to inhabit the convent after it is established. In­
deed, we would be poor Alchemists if we could not produce gold
in any desirable quantity, if some real benefit for humanity
could be effected thereby— and of this I shall convince you,
Weekly Master Monograph A M O R C ■The Rosicrucian Order

if you desire it. But gold is a curse to mankind, and we do not wish
to increase the curse from which humanity suffers. Distribute gold
among men, and you will only create a craving for more; give them
gold, and you will transform them into devils. No; it is not gold
that we need; it is men who thirst after wisdom. There are thousands
who desire knowledge, but few who desire wisdom. Intellectual devel­
opment, sagacity, craftiness, cunning, are today mistaken for spiritual^
development, but this conception is wrong; animal cunning is not in­
telligence, craftiness is not wisdom, and your most learned men are
the last ones who can bear the truth. Even many of your would-be oc­
cultists and Rosicrucians have taken up their investigations merely
for the purpose of gratifying their idle curiosity, while others de­
sire to pry into the secrets of nature to obtain knowledge which they
intend to employ for the attainment of selfish ends. Give us men or
women who desire nothing else but the truth, and we will take care of
their needs. How much money will it require to lodge a person who
cares nothing for comfort? What will it take to furnish the kitchen
for those who have no desire for dainties? What libraries will be re­
quired for those who can read in the book of nature? What external
pictures will please those who wish to avoid a life of the senses and
to retire within their own selves? What terrestrial scenery shall be
selected for those who live within the paradise of their souls? What
company will please those who converse with their own higher self? How
can we amuse those who live in the presence of God?"
Here the Adept paused for a moment, and then continued, saying:
"Verily, the theosophical monastery of which I dream is even superior
to ours. It is located far away from this earth, and yet it can be
reached without trouble and without expense. Its monks and nuns have
risen above the sphere of self. They have a temple of infinite dimen­
sions, pervaded by the spirit of sanctity, being the common possession
of all. There the differentiation of the Universal Soul ceases, and
Unification takes place. It is a convent where there exists no dif­
ference of sex, of taste, of opinion, and desire; where vice cannot
enter; where none are born, or marry, or die, but where they live like
the angels; each one constituting the centre of a power for good; each
one immersed in an infinite ocean of light; each one able to see all
he desires to see, to know all he wants to know, growing in strength
and expanding in size, until he embraces the All and is one with it."
For a moment it seemed as if the soul of the Adept had gone and
visited that blissful state of Nirvana, a state of which we mortals
cannot conceive; but soon the light returned into his eyes, and he
smilingly excused himself, saying that he had permitted himself to be
carried away by the sublimity of this idea. I ventured to say that
probably millions of ages would pass away before mankind would arrive
______ at that state.
"Alas!" he answered, "the conditions which our present
state of civilization imposes upon its followers are now such
Weekly Master Monograph ■ A M O R G ■The Rosicrucian Order

ELEVENTH DEGREE NUM BER FIFTY PAGE THREE
as to force the vast majority of the latter to employ nearly all their
time and energy in an outward direction, instead of employing them for
their inward growth. Each man has a certain amount of energy which he
may call his own. If he wastes all that energy on the outward plane,
either for the attainment of sensual gratification or in intellectual
g, pursuits, he will have nothing left to develop the divine germ in his
heart. If he continually concentrates his mind outwardly, there will
be no inward concentration of thought, which is absolutely necessary
for the attainment of self-knowledge. The laboring classes, the
people of commerce, the scientists, doctors, lawyers, and clergymen
are all actively engaged in outward affairs, and find little time for
the inward concentration of their powers. The majority are continu­
ally busy to run after shadows and illusions, which are at best only
useful as long as they last, but whose usefulness ceases when the heart
ceases to beat. Their time and energy are taken up in procuring what
they call the 'necessities of life, ' and they excuse themselves by
saying that it is their misfortune to be so situated as to be forced
to procure them. Nature, however, cares nothing for our excuses; the
law of cause and effect is blind and inaccessible to argumentation.
A man climbing over a mountain top and falling over a precipice is
as much in danger of breaking his neck as if he had jumped down vol­
untarily; a man who is not able to progress will be left as far be­
hind as one who does not desire to progress. But Nature is not so
cruel as she appears to be to the superficial observer. That which
man requires for the purpose of living is very little indeed, and can
usually easily be obtained; for Nature has amply provided for all of
her children; and if they cannot all obtain their proper share, then
there must be something seriously wrong, either with them individually
or with the social organization as a whole. There is undoubtedly a
great deal wrong in our social organization, and our philosophers and
politicians are continually trying to remedy it. They will succeed
in their task when they succeed in making the laws of the human world
harmonize with the laws of Nature, and not before. That event may take
place in the far-distant future. We have not the time to wait for it.
Let each one attempt to restore harmony in his own individual organism
and live according to natural laws, and the harmony of the social or­
ganism as a whole will be restored.
"The great bulk of those things which are said to be the neces­
sities of life are only artificially created necessities. Millions of
people lived and attained old age long before many of the things
which our modern civilization considers as being absolutely necessary
had been discovered or invented. The term 'necessity' has a relative
meaning; and to a king a dozen palaces, to a nobleman a carriage with
four, may appear as much a necessity as to a beggar a bottle of whis­
key, or to a fashionable man a new swallow-tail coat. To get
rid at once of all such fancied necessities and the trouble
which is imposed upon us to attain them, the shortest and
surest way is to rise above such necessities and to consider
Weekly Master Monograph A M O R C ■The Rosicrucian Order
TEMPLE M O N O G R A P H — C—
ELEVENTH DEGREE NUM BER FIFTY PAGE FOUR
them not to be necessary at all. Then a great amount of our energy
would become free, and might be employed for the acquisition of that
which is really necessary, because it is eternal and permanent, while
that which serves merely temporal purposes ends in time.
"There are thousands of people engaged in prying into the details ^
of the constitution of external objects to learn the chemical and
physiological processes going on therein, without manifesting the
least curiosity to know their own constitution and the processes go­
ing on within their own organization; although it would seem that a
knowledge of the latter is far more important than an investigation
of the former. Science says that she wants to know the laws of Nature
in all their minute ramifications, and yet she pays no attention
whatever to the universal and fundamental law from which all these
ramifications spring; and thus she resembles an insect crawling over
a fallen leaf and imagining thereby to learn the qualities of the tree.
It is surely the prerogative of intellectual man to investigate intel­
lectually all the departments of nature; but the investigation of
external things is only of secondary importance to the attainment of
knowledge of our own interior powers. All primary powers act from
within; effects are secondary to causes. He who considers the knowl­
edge of external things to be more important than the knowledge of
self, possesses very little wisdom indeed."
"These doctrines," I said, "will never be accepted by our school­
men; they look upon the very term 'Theosophy* with contempt; they be­
lieve that a knowledge of external things is the only knowledge at­
tainable, and the only one worth having, and this illusive knowledge
they call exact science."
"I pity them for their imperfections," answered the Adept; "nev­
ertheless their views are justifiable from their own standpoint. If
they object to the term 'Theosophy' it is because they do not know what
the term means; and as it has often been misapplied, they have formed
a misconception about it. We can know nothing except what we know
theosophically: because theosophical knowledge is the result of feel­
ing, seeing, and understanding a thing. Their sense of seeing and
feeling does not penetrate below the external surface of things, and
they therefore know theosophically merely the outward appearance, and
the internal causes are left to speculations which are often errone­
ous. The higher sense, by which the Adept is able to penetrate with
his consciousness into the interior of things and identify himself
for the time being with the object of his observation, share its sen­
sations, to feel as if he were that object, to see the workings of the
interior causes, and consequently be able to understand them, is un-
_____ known to the scientists of our present civilization."
As the Adept finished this sentence, a sound as if pro­
duced by the tinkling of small silver bells was heard in the
Weekly Master Monograph ■The Rosicrucian Order

ELEVENTH DEGREE NUM BER FIFTY PAGE FIVE
air above our heads. I looked up, but nothing was to be seen from
which that sound could have proceeded.
"This is the signal," said the Adept, "that the members of our
order are assembled in the Refectory. Let us go to Join their com­
pany. Some refreshment will undoubtedly be welcome to you."

Summary of This Monograph
V V V
Below is a summary of the important principles of this monograph. It contains the essential
statements which you should not forget. After you have carefully read the complete mono­
graph, try to recall as many as you can of the important points you read. Then read this
summary and see if you have forgotten any. Also refer to this summary during the ensuing
week to refresh your memory.
The Imperator, at the ancient monastery, continues his discussion of the ideal monas­
tery, or convent:
In it would be taught the mastery of self as well as true knowledge of the fundamen­
tal laws of the universe, unhampered by orthodox teachings. This convent would be
peopled by men and women who would be desirous of nothing but truth; their exter­
nal, material needs would be few. Its nuns and monks would have risen above the
sphere of self. Here there would be unification of the Universal Soul.
Our present state of civilization demands time and energy expended in outward direc­
tion, leaving little to develop the divine germ in the heart. Inward concentration is
necessary to the attainment of self-knowledge. The law of cause and effect is inacces­
sible to argumentation.
If each one were to restore harmony in his own organism, that is, live according to
natural laws, the harmony o f the social organism as a whole would be restored.
The investigation of external things is of secondary importance to the attainment of
knowledge of our own interior powers. All primary powers act from within; effects are
secondary to causes.
