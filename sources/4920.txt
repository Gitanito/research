T h e P R E F A C E .
T ^ \ T S E A S E is undoubtedly the m oft fatal enem y o f m ankind. T o
prevent its approaches, or to overcom e its attacks, is perhaps the
m oft im portant concern c f our liv e s ; and an inquifition that appears
o n ly attainable b y the m oft natural and Am ple m eans. F o r this purpolc
M r. N ich o las C u lpeper's E n g l i s h P h y s i c i a n feem s p eculiarly w ell
adapted; fince it reforts, for every m ode o f C u re, to that in fa llib le
fource prepared by G od and N atu re, in the vegetable fy fte m ; w hence
flow fpontaneoufly the genuine V irtu es o f M ed icin e, diffufed univcrfally
over the face o f the w h o le earth , •where nothing grows in vain /
Indeed, had this ingenious and m oft invaluable W o rk no other recom ­
m endation than having palled through fo m any editions, yet w ould it
fufficicm ly ju ftify m y offering it once m ore to the notice and confideratlon
o f an enlightened p u b lic. B u t, w hen w e refled on the difeoveries fince
made in the botanical w orld— the great acquifitions derived to the W o rk
b y the addition o f upwards o f one hundred n ew ly difeovered arom atic
and balfam ic herbs— independent o f the phyfical fk ill and philofophical
perception difplayed by its A u th o r, w e {hall find innum erable inftances
o f its u tility, and perceive in it a fund o f inform ation and m edical ac­
quirem ents, w h ich prom ife the m oft extenfive benefits to fociety, by
form ing a Domejiic Pbyfician in every F am ily.
It m ight perhaps have been replete w ith the happieft confequences to
our beloved K in g under his late in firm ity, and w ould unqueftionably have
tended more q u ick ly to difpel the painful apprehenfions o f his afflicted peo-
No. i. p ic,

pic, had th isgreatM ad cro fh u m an n atu reb ecn con tem p orary w ith us. N o
m an, I believe, but the profejionaliy envious, w ill prefum e to queftion his
m edical abilities, or preferibe lim its to his phyfical kn ow lcge, w h ich
eclipfed the pradtice o f every phyfician o f his day, and put to filence the
w hole tribe o f em pirics and qu acks. I cannot give a higher p ro o f o f his
profeflional difcerm r.ent, nor any th in g m ore applicable to the anxious feel­
ings o f m y reader, than by fh ew in g h o w exactly he has pointed out the
diforder w ith w hich h is M ajefty was lately afflidted, and the fim ples w hich
are applicable to its feveral ftages, fo exact and critical, that, i f he had
been liv in g , and appointed one o f the con fu ltin g phyficians, he could
not have m arked the outline o f it w ith more precifion.
H e didinguifhes difeafes w h ich produce ph ren zy into three different
claffes ; the fecond he terms peripbrenetio. H e deferibes it thus : “ It is
preceded by a very (harp fever, w h ich w ill rage for a few days v io le n tly :
w hen it fubfides, the delirium takes place w ith fits o f the fever at irre­
gular in te rv a ls; the patient w ill be rem arkably voracious j all his pafiions
w ill be very ftrong j his lu cid intervals llio rt; his deep feem ingly o f a
lo n g duration, b u t, in fadt, th is deep is nothin g but d o lin g ; w hen he
awakes he w ill feem fu lly occupied w ith fom e favourite fubjedt, fuch as
Tinging, h u n tin g, dancing, & c . H is recolledtion w ill fom etim es ferve
him fo as to kn ow particular perfons, but that w ill not la d lo n g .”
A fter having deferibed the effedl o f the diforder, he next enters m i­
nutely into an inveftigation o f the feat o f it. A n d here, .with his ufual
feverity againft his brethren, th e phyficians, he fays, “ T h e y , poor ig ­
norant m en, th in k this is a diforder in the heady whereas, in fadt, it arifes
from an in jury w h ich is received in the diaphragm , or m idriff. T h e ufe
o f this m em brane is (befidcs fuftaining the upper parts o f the abdom en)
to convey coolin g m oidu rc to the brain, in order to cool the h o t h u ­
m ours w h ich fiy to it from th e feveral parts o f the intedines, and par­
ticu larly .
P R E F A C E .

Vll
ticularly the liver. N o w , if the diaphragm be ftrained, bruifed, or
otherw ife hurt, it confequently fails in perform ing its function, and the
brain w ill fuffsr a delirium , more or lefs, in proportion as the diforder in
the diaphragm is better or w o rfe/'
H e then ftates the manner in w h ich this malady m ay arife. “ It may
happen by overlifting, by fig h tin g , by violent riding, by want o f a p ro­
per quantity o f nouriflim ent, w hereby the membrane lofes its tone and
vigour, and fails in its duty. H ence the firft fym ptom s o f approaching
death, w hich appears in people w h o are ftarved, is a delirium , w hich is
occafioned by a heat in the brain, for want o f proper m oifture from
the midrifF.”
H e next points out the rem edy, w h ich he confcfles is very difficult ;
inafm uch as the m idriff, being a m embrane only, w ill not yield to the
fame remedies that the m ufcular part o f the body w ill. H aving a view
towards “ keeping the fever under, the internals (hould be flrengthened
by nourishing alim ent. T h e ch efl and abdomen rubbed w ith arom atic
and corroborating oils— the habit prevented from being too lax— and the
bow els, if tending to laflitude, Should be bound up, and kept in due to n e/'
H e then gives a variety o f oils and fim ples, w h ich are extrem ely ufeful
in this diforder ; and concludes w ith advifing conSlant attention to the
patient; to indulge his defires as often as it may be done w ith fafety,
but not to diflurb his inteftines w ith too m uch p h yfic, and thereby
weaken and injure, inftead o f relieving, the patient.
In a lim ilar w ay does this learned anthor proceed in the treatm ent o f
all the infirmities incident to m ankind, carefully pointing out, by ana­
tomical rules, the feat o f the diforder, and then applying fuch lim pid
medicines and regim en as N ature herfelf direfts, w ithou t expofing the
patient to the danger o f violent experim ents, or torturing his inteftines
t w ith
R R E F A C E.
w ith irritating drugs, w h ich inftead o f effecting a cure, often augm ent
the difeafe, and not unfrequently occafion prem ature death.
Som e authors have laboured to prove, that the difference o f opinion
b etw ixt C ulpeper and his brother phyficians originated entirely from
h is ow n furly and vindictive difpofition. B u t w hoever has taken the
pains to invefligate the controverly, will find this affertion m olt remote
from the truth. H e found the practice o f phyfic directed m ore by terms
o f art than by principles o f nature $ and governed m ore by avarice than
b y a genuine defire o f reftoring health and ftrength to the defponding
patient. H e condem ned this practice, by expofing the w ickednefs o f
iom e and the ignorance o f others ; and, th o u g h he had the w h o le m edi­
cal corps to encounter, yet fu ch was the force o f his reafoning, and the
fuperiority o f his abilities, that they fubm itted to th e fentence he had
paffed upon them , w ith ou t the form ality o f a defence.
B u t, after a w h ile, the allied fons o f EJcufaptus, having difeovered that
M r. C ulpeper's practice w as guided by aftrological precepts, rallied
again, and renewed the com bat w ith accum ulated fu ry. E very in fu ltin g
reflection, calculated to im peach his underftanding, was levelled at him j
and the occu lt properties o f the celellial fyflem were ridiculed and denied.
O u r author, how ever, was not to be driven fo eafily from his purpofe.
H e im m ediately publifhed a tra£l in defence o f the aftral fcience, w hich
he maintained againft the united oppofition o f both the C olleges ; and, by
introducing it into his pradlice, he perform ed cures w h ich aftonifhed his
com petitors, and rendered h is name im m ortal.
E xperien ce, therefore, o u gh t to convince us, how ever oppofed by
abftradt rcafoning, that there is indifputably an innate and occu lt vir­
tue infufed into all fublunary th in gs, anim al, vegetable, and m ineral, b y
the adtion o f the heavenly bodies upon the am bient and elem entary m atter,
w h ich , by the m otions and m utations o f the lum inaries being conftantly
varied,
viii
P R E F A C E . ix
varied, produce that adonifhing variety in N ature, w h ich is infinitely
beyond our know ledge or com prehenfion. H ence ariie the fym pathies ami
antipathies fo aflonifhingly confpicuous in all the productions o f the earth
whether animate or inanim ate, in men or brutes, in vegetables or m ine­
rals and in every fpecies o f m atter definable to our fenfes. H ere alfo
w e difeover the ejjhitial properties and firjl ground o f all m edicine, and
are furniflied w ith the b ed rcafons w h y it is im pofflble to preferibe re­
medies at all tim es applicable to the ftupendous varieties afflicting the
body o f m an, w ithout the aid o f iydercal learning.
T h ere is no doubt but the rem ote as w ell as the propinquatc caufes o f
things ought ferioufly to be invefligated both by philofophcrs and p h y-
ficians ; or elfe the m ufic o f fcience w ill often fail o f its harm ony, and
produce difeord and d ifgu ft. T h e planetary influx, and the force o f the
am bient, is as neceffary to be confulted, as the d r u flu r e o f the body, and
the laws o f p u lfation ; otherw ife our practice w ill be im perfeCt, and our
fuccefs determined b y chance. F o r thisreafon, the learned Senertus, in
his Elements o f Pbyjic, h igh ly com m ends thofe m odern phyficians, w ho
unite aftrological w ith m edical know ledge : “ F o r,” — continues this in­
genious author,— “ the liars a£i upon inferior bodies not only by heat and
lig h t, but by occult in flu en ce;— nor can it be doubted but that all plants
are under the governm ent o f fom e particular planet, and perform their
operations by virtue o f the fym pathy co -exid en t in their nature.”
B y the right know ledge o f tim es and fcafons, o f caufes and effeCls, the
m ofl im portant cures have unqueftionably been perform ed. ** N o man,
fays Galen, can reafonably deny, b u t that the natural ground o f m edicine
and difeafe depends m uch upon aftral influx and elem entary im prefflon ;
and hence it is, that, by the n ativity or decum biture o f the patient, we are
enabled to difeern both the caufe and conclufion o f the difeafe; and, by
confidering the quality o f the principal afpefts in airy, w atery, earthy,
N o . l . b or
X P R E F A C E .
or fiery, figns or conftellations, all doubts and difficulties are rem oved; a
plain and obvious mode o f treatm ent prefents itfe lf to our v ie w ; and fu r-
niflies a lin k in g p ro o f o f the w ife ceconom y o f the Suprem e Being*
in governing this inferior w o rld by the influence and energy o f the fupe-
rior bodies, w hofe very minutia> as w ell as m ore m agnificent phenom ena,
are invariably obedient to a regular and unerring la w .”
B u t, although the aftrologic fcience be thus ufeful in gu id in g ou r m e­
dical enquiries, and neceffary in forw arding the cure o f rem ote and latent
difeafes: yet were the enem ies o f C u lp ep er, lik e m any o f the prefent
day, e x u k in g ly forward to condem n that w h ich they do not underftand,
and by attem pting to bafHe the fecret operations o f nature, and the ftrong
influences o f the planetary fyftem — o f the Pleiades, A r ifurus, and Orion,
they expofe the w caknefs o f th eir ow n im aginations, w h ich they in fu lt-
in g ly oppofe to theglorious hoft o f heaven•
P erfectly indifferent, m yfelf, as to the cavils o f diffatisfied critics or
to the cenfurc o f interefled m en, I fhall revive that fim ple practice o f
C ulpeper, w hich fpread, through the B ritifli realm s, the happy art o f
reftoring to priftine vigour— the decaying life and health o f m ankind.
F or this purpofe, I have incorporated into the prefent edition o f his
P h y s i c i a n and H e r b a l , every ufeful part o f all his other w o r k s ; and
have added a feledtion o f eafy rules, for attaining an intim ate acquaintance
w ith all the B ritifh herbs and p lan ts; for difeovering the real planetary
in flu x ; and for gathering them at thofe particular feafons w hen they im ­
bibe a double portion o f efficacy and virtue.
In gathering herbs fo r m edicinal ufes, the planetary hour is certainly
o f im portance, how ever m odern refinem ent m igh t have exploded the idea.
In nature, the fim pleft rem edies are found to produce the m od falutary
e ffe d b ; and in earlier tim es, w hen the art o f m edicine was lefs obfeured,
and pradlifed more from m otives o f benevolence, the w orld was lefs afHidted
i w ith
P R E F A C E . xi
w ith difeafe, and the period o f hum an life lefs contracted. T h e labora­
tory o f nature, were it but confu ltcd , furniSheth am ple remedies for every
curable diforder incident to m an kin d; for, notw ithstanding the parade o f
com pound m edicines, the art o f healing confifts not fo m uch in the
preparation, as in the due application, o f the rem edy. H ence it happens
that old wom en, w ithout education or abilities, by the help o f a fim ple
herb gathered in the planetary hour, in w hich hour it im bibes its greatefl
Strength and efculent virtue, w ill fom etim es perform very extraordinary
cures, in cafes where the regular bred, phyfician is abfolutely at a lofs
h o w to treat them .
I w ould not here be understood to caft any unw orthy reflexions upon
thofe exalted characters, w ho have made p h yfic, and the alleviation o f
hum an infirm ity, the principal ftudy o f their lives. T h e m any invaluable
difeoveries lately added to the Pharm acopoeia, bo th frem the vegetable
and mineral w orlds, are Strong argum ents o f the necefiity o f regular prac­
tice and o f profeflional education in form ing the Phyfician. B u t, were
the bulk o f thefe gentlem en to con fu lt a little more the planetary in ­
fluence, and the effects o f Saturn and them oon in each crifis and critical
day, and regulate their preferiptions accordingly, I am perfuaded m ore
immediate relief w ould in m oft cafes be afforded to the Tick and languifh-
ing patient. Surgery too, w h ich , like a guardian angel, Steps forward
to alleviate the perilous accidents o f the unfortunate, w ould gain m uch
im provem ent by the like confiderations. It is not the humane and
liberal profefTors o f phyfic or furgery, w hofe praclice deferves cenfure,
but that mercenary tribe o f pretenders to phyfic, w ho now pervade the
kingdom , and, like a Swarm o f locufts from the caft,prey upon the vitals
o f m ankind. T h efe m onfters in the ftiape o f m en, w ith hearts callous
to every fentiment o f com panion, have only fees in view . Governed by
this fordid principle, they fport w ith life, unmoved amidft the bitter an-
guifh and piercing groans o f the tortured patient, w hom , when too far
gone for human aid to reftore, they abandon to defpair and death.

congenial to the bleflings o f health and freedom .
T h e laws o f phyfic are agreeable to the laws o f nature. P h yfic im i­
tates N ature. Its defign is, to preferve the body in health— to defend
it from infirm ity— to drengthen and invigorate the w eak, and to raife
the dejetted. In a w ord, the falutary effedt o f natural m edicine keeps
the body in a progreflive date o f health and com fort, until the approach
o f death— that certain and inevitable confequence o f o u re x id e n cc, w h ich
no art, nor invention, nor the greated power o f princes, can prevent or

o f investigating this valuable branch o f literature. N o fcience prefents
to our contem plation a m ore extenfive field o f im portant kn ow ledge, or
affords m ere am ple entertainm ent to an inquifitivc or philanthropic m ind.
A n atom y, B o t a n y , C hem istry, and the M ateria M cdica, are branches
o f natural H ifto ry, fraught wi t h fuch am ufem ent and u tility , that he w ho
neglects them can have no claim to tafte or learning. T h e vegetable
W o rld , w ith its occu lt virtues and pow er, is, o f all others, the fublim eft
fu b je ft for the exertion o f gen iu s, and affords the higheft gratification
to a benevolent m ind s fince there are no infirm ities incident to our fallen
nature that it does not enable us to alleviate or rem ove.
It is a m elancholy reflection, daily confirm ed b y obfervation and e x ­

is neceffary for every man to becom e a phyfician j for fuch an attem pt

O D , the omnipotent and wife Creator, having made all things out o f no­
thing, and from a crude and undigefted mafs, according to his will, and by
his word, brought all things into a decent frame and majeftic ftrufture:
out o f a confufed chaos made the heavens and the earth* out o f that which was
dark and void he created light, he feparated the waters from the earth, and gave
bounds to the unruly waves* and indued the dry and barren earth with prolific
virtue, richly adorning it with grafs, herbs, and fruit-trees* he made the fun, moon,
and ftars, to divide the light from the darknefs, to enlighten and rule both day and
night, to be for figns, and todiftinguifh feafons, days, and years * by his word he
created every living thing that movech.
Having thus far proceeded in h is fo excellent and admirable workmanlhip o f crea­
tion, he made man a fummary o f the world’s fabric, afmall draught o f the divine
nature : he was made after other creatures, not only as the moft jjerfeft, but as the
fuperintendant and matter, o f all things* creatcdQuoddominetur inpifeis waris, el in
coheres caliy et inpecudesy el in univerfam terramy atque in omnia reptilia reptantiafuper

cattle, and over the earth, and over every creeping thing.’*

In man he ended his w ork; on man he ftamped his fcal and fign o f his power, on
him he has imprinted his own image and fuperfeription, his arms and his portraiture.
Dixit Dens, faciamus hominu.ma i imaginemnofiram,feainehmfimilitudimmnofiram: ‘ cGod
faid, Jet us make man in our image, after our likenefs.” In the creation o f man,
God feemeth to deliberate and take council with himfelf, how to epitomizeand gather
together all his works in fo fmall a compafs, to contract his book of creation into fo
fmall a volume. H e is called the microcofm, or little world, the recapitulation of
all things, the ligament of angels and beafts, heavenly and earthly, fpiritual and cor­
poreal, the perfection of the whole work, the honour and miracle o f nature. H e
created him naked, being a pure, neat, and delicate, creature, made up o f thin,
fubtile, well-tempered, and feafoned, humours, innocent, and far more beautiful
than the reft.
He was created upright, but little touching the earth, quite oppofite to thevegeta­
ble plant, whofe root is therein fixed; far different alfo from the beaft, who is a mean
between a plant and himfelf, and goeth downward, his two extremes tending to the
bounds of the horizon: this upright gait belonging only unto the human fpecics, as
the holieft and rnoft divine creature, his head tending to the heavens, on which he
looks, and contemplates with grateful adoration the omnipotence o f his Creator.
H is body being thus formed of pure fubtile earth, as a houfe and habitation for
the foul, God breathed in him the breath of life, and he became a living creature;
fo, in the ordinary generation and formation, which is made o f the feed in the womb,
nature obferveth the felf-fame order; the body is firft formed, as well by the elemen­
tary force, which is in the feed and the heat of the matrix, as by the celeftial influence
o f the fun; according to the adage, fol el homo generant hominem: “ T he fun and
man do engender m a n w h i c h is done, according to the opinion of the moft eminent
naturalifts and phyficians, in fuch order that the firft feven days the feed o f the man
and the ova o f the woman mingle and curdle like cream, which is the beginning of
conception; the fecond feven days, the feed is changed into a formlefs bloody fub-
ftance, and conco&ed into a thick and undigefted mafs o f flelh, the proper matter of
the child; the next feven days, from this mafs is produced and falhioned a grofs
body, with the three moft noble parts, viz. the liver, heart, and brain; the fourth
feven days, or near thirty, the whole body is perfected, jointed, and organized, and
is fit to entertain the foul, which invefts itfelf into the body (according to the beft
authority) about the feven-and-thirtiech or fortieth day: at the third month, or
thereabout, the infant hath motion and fenfe; anti at the ninth month is brought
forth. Tliefe times cannot be fo exa&ly prefixed, but that by the ftrength or de­
bility of the feed or matrix it may be either haftened or prolonged. But I fhall
not

AND F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 3
not enter minutely upon this fubje£l now, but give a more particular defcription of
it hereafter.
The body of man confifts o f a number o f bones and cartilages, which are the bafis
and upholding pillars of the whole fabric, the joints are compacted with many liga­
ments, and are covered with innumerable membranes: the members are fupplied with
above thirty pair of fcnfitive nerves, as with little cords; and all filled with as many
arteries, like water-pipes, conveying vital fpirits to all parts; the empty places are fil­
led up with above four hundred mufcles of different forts, all covered with a (kin.
Man, for whom all things were made, is nourifhed by the balfamic fpirits of vege­
tables, and therefore doth confift o f all thefe faculties, that fpring up as a token of
health or ficknefs. T he celeftial planets have alfo great influence over him ; the
moiftening power o f the Moon is reprefented by the marrow which flows from the
brain *
, in the genital part is Venus feated; eloquence and comelinefs are the effects
o f nimble-witted M ercury; the Sun hath a near affinity to the heart; benevolent
J upiter hath his feat in the liver, the fountain o f nutritive blood; the fiery fury o f
Mars is lodged in the g a ll; the fpungy and hollow melt, the feat and receptacle of
melancholic humours, is a perfect reprefentation o f the cold planet Saturn. Indeed,
the fpirits of the body do manifeft and hold forth the quinteffence o f all things. The
four humours in man anfwer to the four elements: as the bile, which is hot and dry,
reprefenteth the fire; hot and moift blood, the air; phlegm, cold and moift, the wa­
ter ; cold and dry melancholy, the earth. Man is an admirable creature, the univerfe
and epitome o f the world, and the horizon of corporal and incorporal things. I
fhall conclude this part with the faying o f Zoroaftes: “ O m an! the workmanfhip
o f mod powerful nature, for it is the moft artificial mafter-piece of God’s hands!”
A D E S C R I P T I O N o f t h e H E A D .
T H E head o f man poflefles the higheft place in the body, and reprefents the
uppermoft and angelical region: it is the fort o f man’s mind, the feat of reafon, the
habitation of wifdom, the place o f memory, judgment, and cogitation : it containeth
the brain, cold and fpongious by nature, inclofed with two fkins, the one, more
hard and thick, joining itfelf to the dura mater; the other, more thin and eafy,
wherein lieth the brain inclofed, called pia mater; it is foft and tender to the brain, and
nourifheth it, as a loving mother doth her young and tender babe; from the^/7?ma­
ter iffue the finews and marrow that defeendeth and falleth down through the
vertebra of the back to the reins. In the brain is the feat and throne o f the rational
foul, in which are a very great number of veins and -arteries running through all the
fubftance
Jubilance thereof, adminiftering to the brain both fpirit and life, vital and nutri-
mental nourjfhmcnt, which comes from the heart and liver by very minute or
Jmall veins and arteries j and concodted and re-concodled, elaborated, and made very
fubtile, parting through chofe woven and interlaced, turning and winding, in which
labyrinth the vital fpirit, often palling and reparting, is perfcdled and refined, and be­
comes animal.
The pia mater divides the fubftance o f the brain into three certain cells and divi-
fitns, the foremoft part o f which contains the moft, the middle partlefs, and the
hindmoft part the leaft. In the foremoft part o f the brain imagination feated * in
the middle, judgment; in the hindmoft part, memory: imagination ishot and dry in
quality, quick and adtive, from whence it cometh thatfrantic men, and fuch as are
Tick of hoc maladies, are excellent in that which belongs to imaginationj many, up­
on l'uch a diftemper, have been excellent in poetry and divination; it never fleepeth,
but is always working, whether the man be rteeping or waking ; and by the vapours
that arife from the heart, form variety o f cogitations, which, wanting the regulation
o f judgment, when manJkepetb becomes a dream.
Hence it appears that lubtilety, promptitude, and that which they commonly call
wit, belongeth to a hot imagination: it is adtive, ftirring, undertaketh all, and
lets all the reft to work it gathers the kinds of figures of things, both prefent, by
the ufe o f the five fenfes, and abfent, by the common fenfe.
Judgment is leatedinthe midft o f the brain, there to bear rule over the other
faculties-, it is the feat o f the rational foul, and the judge o f men's adtions: if you
know the mean, whereby it knoweth and judgeth o f things, learned authors have
been o f opinion, that the fpirit knoweth by the help ot the fenfes, and that the un-
dtrftanding without the fenfes is but as white paper. N il eft in intelkftu, quod non
futritpriusinfenfu: “ There isnothingintheunderftanding which was notfirft in the
fenfe.” Butthisopinionis falfe, becaufe the feeds of fcienceand virtue are infinuated
into our fpirits, elfe is the ftate o f the reafonable foul worfe than the vegetative or
lenfitive, which o f themfelves are able to exercife their fundtions. It were abfurd
to think that fo noble and divine a faculty fiiould beg artiftance o f fo vile and cor­
ruptible a one as the fenfes, which apprehend only the fimple accidents, not the na­
tures nor eflence, of things: and, were it fo, it muft follow, that they who have their
lenfes moft perfedt fhould be moft witty, whereas we many times fee the contrary.
Y et let no one think, that the fpirit hath no fervice from the fenfes, for in the begin­
ning, ordifeovery and invention o f things, the fenfes do much fervice to the fpirir,
but the fpirit dependeth not upon the fenfes. Some are o f opinion, that it is hot and
moift in quality,others fay, that a dry temperature is proper to the underftanding,
whereby
383 C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
AND F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y .
whereby ic comes to pafs that aged perfons excel thofe in underftanding that arc
young, becaufe, as years increafe, moifturedoth decreafe in the brain *
, hence it fol­
lowed), that melancholic perfons, that are afflicted with want, and fafi much, are
wife and ingenious^ for heavinefs and fading are great driers : Splendorficctts, animus
fiipientijimusy vexatio dat intelkftttm *
, “ Heat and draught refine the wit, affliction
giveth underftanding j ” and that is the reafon that great perfons, who feed high, and
take little or no care, that have nothing to vex them, are for the mod part not very
wife.
Beads that are o f a dry temperature, as ants, bees, elephants, & c. are cunning
and ingeniousj on the contrary, they that are of a moift conftitucion are tlupid and
without fpirit. Memory is feated in the hinder cell of the brain, as the grand ac­
countant or regifter \ fome fay its temperature is cold and dry, and that is thought
to be the reafon why melancholic people have good memories; others are o f opinion
that it is moift, becaufe children have better memories than old m en; men are more
apt for memory in the morning, by reafon of the moifture gained by deep in the
night ♦, but, let it be as it may, it is moft certain that thofe who have a good memory
are not in general very wife.
It is true, thatmanyhave been excellent in this faculty. Seneca repeated two thou*
fand names as they were firft fpoken he alfo, hearing two hundred verfes, rehearfed
them, and began at the laft. Cyrus and Scipio knew every foldier’s name in their
armies. Mithridates learned the languages of two-and-twenty nations. El'dras the
prieft had the whole Jewifti doCtrine by heart. Julius Gefar would dictate to four
at the fame time 5 and, that which is more ftrange, Pliny would dictate toone, hear
another, and read at the fame inftant. A s thefe were fo excellent and acute in me­
mory,others were as d u ll: Atticus could never learn the letters of the alphabet by
heart*, others could not count above four. It is faid, that Theodore Bcza, two
years before he died, as helanguifhed, his mind grew fo feeble that he forgot things
prefent, yet he held thofe things which were printed in his mind before-time, when
his underftanding and memory were good. W hat lhall we fay o f Mcflalla Cornivus,
who forgot his own name? or FrancifcusBarbarus, of Athens, a very learned man in
the Greek tongue, who, having received a blow on the head with a ftone, forgot
his learning, which he had fpent the greateft part of his life-time upon, yet remem­
bered all things elfe ? Thefe things are brought to pafs either by the ftrength or
debility of men’s genitures, and from directions and accidents thence proceeding.
W it and underftanding, and all the faculties o f the foul, depend on a certain tem­
perament *
, and hence it comes to pafs that thofe who are acute and wife in fome
things are ftupid and dull in others.

The fenfuive faculty has its refidence in the pia mater \ it is that which gives
virtue to all the particular fenfes, and keeps a harmony amongft them : they are five
in number, viz. feeing, hearing, fmelling, tailing, and feeling; although thefe
are all united in one in the brain, yet operatively they are diftinguifhed in their
feveral feats and places o f refidence.
T he sight refides in the eyes, and particularly in the chryftalline humour; they
are two in number, and collateral, planted in the higheft ftage, or centinels; they
are the luminaries o f the microctfm ; Galen fays, the brain and head were made for
the eye, that they might be in the hlgheil, as a beholder in a tow er; they are next
in nature unto the foul; for in the eye is feen and kn >wn the difturbances and
griefs, gladnefs and joys, o f the foul, as love, wrath, and other paffions; they are
compounded and made o f feven tunicles, or coats, and three humours ; they pro­
ceed out o f the fubftance, they take a panicle to defend it from annoyance. They
meet and are united intoone finew, about half an inch in length before they enter
the flcull, and after divided into two, each goeth into one eye; they are called nervi
cpici, the optic nerves, and through thefe are brought the vifible/pints to the eye.
Thefe are the mod noble outward parts o f the body, in beauty, utility, mobility,
and a&ivity. They are to the vifage that which the vifage is to the body, they are
the face o f the face, and, becaufe they are tender, delicate, and precious, they are
fenced on all Tides with fkins, lids, brows, and hair. T h e object o f the eye or fight
is colour (according to the commonopinion), which is an adherent quality in bodies,
whereof there arc fix fimples, as white, yellow, red, purple, green, and blue; the
compounds are infinite; tofpeak more fully, the true objeft is light, which is
never without colour, and without which the colours are invifible.
T he fenfe o f feeing excelleth all the reft in many things; it apprehendeth farther
off, andextendeth itfelf even to the ftars. It is certainly reported, that Strabo
had fuch acute eyes, that from Ulibaum he could difeern (hips going forth o f
the Carthaginian haven, and could number them; the diftance was one hundred
and thirty-five miles. It hath more variety o f objects, for to ail things, and gene­
rally in all, there is a light and colour, the obje&s o f rhe eyes, as I hinted before.
It is moll exquifite, for it is moft exadt, in the lcaft and fineft thing that prefents
itfelf. It is more prompt and fudden, for it apprehendeth even in a moment, and
without motion, when the other fenfes require motion and time. It enjoyeth a
liberty incomparable to others; the eye Teeth, orfeethnot, and therefore hath lids
to
C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
i
AND F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 7
to open or (hut: it is aftive* all the reft purely paflive. But that which is molt
noble in this fenfe is, that the privation of the objett thereof, which is darknefs,
brings fear, and that naturally, becaufe then a man findeth himfelf robbed of fo
excellent a guide; the fight in the light is inftead of company, wherein man much
deJighteth.
H e a r i n g is the next fenfe to be confidered, whofe refidence is intheears; if
is in quality cold and dry, under the dominion o f Saturn. They are placed on the
outfide of the head, in the felf-fame height as the eyes are, as the fcouts o f the
body, porters of the fpirit, the receivers and judges of the founds, which always
afcend. They have their entrance oblique and crooked, that fo the found may not
enter all at once, whereby the fenfe o f hearing might be hindered, and not fo well
able to judge; and again, that the founds, being fugitive, might there lurk, and
abide under his ihadow, till the inftruments of hearing have gotten pofleffion
thereof. The finews, that are the organs of hearing, fpring each from the brain,
and, when they come to the hole o f the ear, they are wreathed together *
, the end is
like a worm, or little teat, into which is received the found, and from thence
carried to the common wits, to diftinguifli. The object of the ear, or hearing, is
a found or noife proceeding from the encounter of two bodies ♦, a pleafant and
melodious found fwectencth and appeafeth the fpirit, confcquently the body too,
and drives maladies from them both; the (harp and penetrant doth trouble and
wound the fpirit. This fenfe hath many Angularities; for the fervace o f the body,
the fight is mod neceflary, but, for the fpirit, hearing hath the (uperiority ; it is
fpiritual, the agent of underftanding ; many that have been blind have been great
and wife philofophers, but never any that were deaf. In brief, fcicnce, truth, and
virtue, have no entrance into the foul but by the ear. Chriftianity teaches, that
faith comech by hearing, which the fight doth rather hurt than help. Faith is the
belief of tbofe things which are not feen, which belief is acquired by hearing. For
all chefe reafons, and many more that might be inferted, the wifcft have fo much
commended hearing, the pure guardian from all corruption, the health o f the in­
ward man.
Sw e l l i n g is feated in the nofe, governed by Mars, and is hot and dry jn quality,
and therefore martial creatures, or fuch as are hot and dry o f conftitution, excel in
this faculty, as dogs, & c. From the brain comcth two finews to the holes o f the
brain-pan, where beginneth the concavity o f the nofe, and thefe two are the pro­
per organs or inftruments of fmelling; they have heads like paps, into which is
received the virtue of fmelling, and prefenting it to the common fenfe. Over thefe
two organs is placed collo.tormny or the noftrils, which concavity or ditch was made
for
s
for two caufes: Firft, that the air, that bringeth the fpirit o f fmelling, might reft
therein, till it was received by its proper organs. Secondly, that the excrement of
the brain might be hidden under it till it be fit to be ejected. From this concavity
go two holes into the mouth, o f which we may take notice of three conveniences:
firft, that when a man’s mouth is clofed, either by eating or fiecping, air might
come through them to the lungs, or he would be forced to keep his mouth open al­
ways. Secondly, they are helpful to a man’s fpeech; for, when one or both o f thole
paftages are flopped, a man ipeaketh in the note, as we commonly fay. Thirdly, they
are uleful in the cleaning the concavities o f the nofe, either by fnuffing, or drawing
ic through the mouth. T he object o f fmell is an odour, or feent, which is a fume
rifing from an odoriferous objedt, attending through the nofe to the ventricles of
the brain *
, the ftrong and violent hurteth the brain, the temperate and good doth
rejoice, delight, and comfort. This fenfe is oftentimes very ufeful in difeovering
meats and drinks of an evil odour, which otherwife would much prejudice the fto-
rnach, and work evil efiedls in the body o f the man.
T h e t a s t e is hot and moift, and under the influence o f Jupiter: this ienle
hath its refidence in the palate o f the mouth and tongue. Its office is to choofe what
food is congruous to the ftomach, and what not. T he fkin o f the palate o f the
mouth is the fame with the inward part o f the ftomach, and the fame with the way
o f the meat to the ftomach *
, and hence it cometh to pafs, that, when a man is touched
upon the palate o f the mouth, it ticklech the ftomach; and, fo much the nearer to
the throat, fo much more the ftomach abhorreth. The objc£fc o f tafting is a favour
or fmack, whereof there are fix Ample kinds, as fweet, four, iharp, tart, fait,
bitter; the compounds are many. And, being led to the mouth, it is not amifs
if J fpeak a few words of the compofition thereof. In the mouth arc five parts to be
confidered, the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the uvula, and the palate o f the mouth,
o f which 1have already fpoken. The lips are made o f a muttulous flefh: their office
is, firft, as the door to the houfe, to keep the mouth clofe till the meat be chewed ;
fecondly, they help to pronounce the fpeech. T he teeth, the hardeft members, are
fattened into the mandible: their office is, firft, to grind the meat before it goeth into
the ftomach, that fo it may the better digeft; fecondly, that it might be a help to
the fpeech, for they that want any o f their teeth are defective therein. T he number
is uncertain, fome have more, fome have lefs, they who have their full number have
thirty- two. The tongue is a carnous member, compound, and made o f many nerves,
ligaments, veins, and arteries, ordained principally for three purpofes: firft, that
when a man eateth, the tongue might turn the meat in the mouth till it be chewed;
fecondly, by the tongue, and the palate of the mouth, near the root of the tongue, is re­
ceived
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
AND F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 9
ceived the tafte o f fweet or four, and thence prefented to common fenfes to pafs judg­
ment thereof: thirdly, and principally, the tongue is ordained for the pronunciation
o f fpeech, o f which faculty I muft crave leave to infift on, and chat as briefly as may
be. Speech is an excellent prefent, and very neceflary, given only unto man, animi
index fc?fpeculum; it is the interpreter and image o f the foul j the heart's mefienger:
the gate through which doth pafs all that licth within the dark and hidden corners
o f man: by this the fpirit becomes vifible. O f all the external and vifible parts of
the body, that which cometh neareft to the heart is the root thereof, and that which
cometh neareft the thoughts is fpeech: “ Out o f the abundance o f the heart the
mouth fpeaketh.” It is a powerful mafter, an imperious commander, it ftirreth up,
animated), exafperateth, appealed), maketh fad, merry; it imprinteth whatever
paflion it handleth; feedeth the foul o f the hearer; it maketh him blufh, wax pale,
laugh, cry, tremble, mad with choler, leap for joy, what not ? It is the agent o f all
our concerns ♦, by it we traffic, peace is handled, affairs are managed, it is the band
o f human foctety \ hearing and fpeech anfwer and are accommodated the one to the
other * by thefe two the fouls are poured the one into the other; fo that, if thefe two
gates be (hut (as it is in thofe that are deaf and dumb), the fpirit remaineth folitary
and miferable. Hearing is the gate toenter, by it the fpirit receiveth all things from
without. Speech is the gate to go out, through it the fpirit fendeth forth that which
was within. From the communication of thefe two, as from the ftrokeof two flints,
there cometh forth the fire o f truth \ and fo by the polilhing and rubbing o f thefe
two, knowledge cometh to perfection \ but hearing is the firft and principal, for
there can nothing come forth which did not firft enter j and therefore he that is deaf
altogether by nature is alfo dumb.
1 might enlarge a great deal more in the defeription o f the head, but, my purpofe
being to declare nothing but what may be pertinent in the manifeftation of the hu­
man faculties and virtues, I fhall conclude this difeourfe with a word or two of the
fenfe of feeling, which is o f no particular quality, but of all, hot, cold, dry, and
m oift: it is deputed to no particular organ, but is fpread abroad over the whole body;
it is the index of all tangible things, its objeft then muft be heat or cold, drought or
moifture, things pleafant and polite, (harp and fmarting, motion, reft, tickling. It
is known that man and other creatures may live without fome particular fenfe; it is
the opinion of mod, that a man cannot live without this fenfe of feeling, being only
neceflary unto life ■, yet Auguftine proveth the contrary, in the fourteenth book, De
Civitate Deitby example of a Prefbyter, that lay as though he were dead, and did not
feel thofe that pulled him, nor would he ftir though they burned him with fire; yet
confefled that he could then hear men fpeak (if they fpoke aloud) as though they

were far from him, by which it appears, that this he did, not by relifting, but for want
o f the fenfe o f feeling, which afterwards was reftorcd to him again. I fhall pafs by
what the Englilh hiftory relates o f one Elizabeth Barton, a maid of Canterbury, who
oftentimes was deprived of her fenfes by reafon of a difeafe Ihe had.
I (hall alfo wave difputes concerning the number o f the fenfes, iome fuppofing
there are no more in nature than are apparent in us. There may very well -bemore,
yet greatly to be doubted that there arc; it is impoflible for us to know them, to
affirm them, or to deny them, becaufe a man Ibal! never know the want o f that fenfe
which he never had: one fenfe cannot difeover another; and, if a man want one by
nature, yet he knows not which way to affirm it. A man that is born blind, and hath
not heard what fight is, cannot conceive that he leeth not, nor defire to fee. So man,
being not able to imagine mare than the five that he hath, cannot know how to judge
whether there be more in nature: who knoweth whether the difficulties that we find
in many o f the works o f nature, and the effects o f many creatures which we cannot
underftand, do proceed from the want of fome fenfe that we have not ? There are
hidden properties which we fee in many things, and a man may fay that there are fen-
fible faculties in nature, proper to judge and apprehend them, yet muft conclude we
have them n o t; who knoweth whether it be fome particular fenfe that difeovereth
the hour of midnight to the cock, and moves him to crow, or how beafts aretaught
to chufe certain herbs for their cure, and many fuch-like wonders ?
O F T H E S T O M A C H .
T H E S T O M A C H is a member compound and fpermatic, finewy and fenfible,
wherein is made the firft perfect digeftion o f chyle: it is a neceflary member to the
body, for, if it fail in its operations, the whole fabric is corrupted. It is in the little
world the fame as the terreftrial globe is in the great world ; in it is exprefied the
lublunary part o f the world; in it are contained the parts that ferve for nutrition,
conception, and procreation. And this leads me to difeourfe o f the adminiftering
virtues in man, which are here feated, and to wind up all with a touch of the office
of the microcofmical ftars with as much brevity as may be. T he ftomach is framed
of two panicles, the outer is carnous, the inner nervous, from which is ftretched to
the mouth afophagus^or the way of the meat, by which the ftomach draweth toitfelf
meat and drink as with hands. By the virtue o f thefubtile will, which is in this
mufius longitudinalfr, is made the attractive virtue, which is hot and dry, by a quality
aPtivc, or principal, which appears by the fun, the fountain o f all heat, which is of
an attractive quality, which is evident by his attracting and exhaling the humidity
i from
C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
AND F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . ii
from this inferior globe into the airy region, as into the neck or higher part of an
alembic; and, being refolved into water, (by reafon o f their weight,) fail down again
upon the earth, which is the veflel receiving: l'o, through continued diftillations, by
fublimation o f the water, by cohabation, by drawing off the liquor (being often
poured on), and fortified by the influence of the celeftial and central fun, the body
becomes endued with a eoncottive, nutritive, and procreative, virtue. So in thefto-
m.ich, by the aftive quality o f the microcofmical fun, his benevolent rays, and friend­
ly heat, meat and drink are defired, and attracted into the ftomach, for the nourifh-
ment of the whole body.
In the ftomach is a tranfverfe mufcle, to withhold or make retention ; by this
retentive virtue, thofe things that are brought into the ftomach are kept and with-
holden until nature hath wrought her end, and every faculty hath executed its office.
It is in quality cold and dry; cold, becaufe the nature o f cold is to comprefs or hold
together, as you may fee in ice; dry, becaufe it is the nature o f drinefs to keep and
hold what is comprelled. It is under the influence o f Saturn, and that is the reafon
why, for the moft part, men that are coldand dry o f temperature, or, as aftronomers
fay, Saturnine people, are covetous and tenacious; and that is the reafon that old men
are naturally covetuous, becaufe Saturn rulech old age, and, by the decay o f nature,
the temperature becomes cold and dry. It hath the fplcen, the reprefentattve o f Sa­
turn, lying toward the left fide, and furnilheth the ftomach with humours neceflary
to fortify the retentive virtue.
The digeftive faculty, which is the chief and moft principal, (the others like hand­
maids attending it,) is hot and moift, nature’s cook and principal workman, the
archaeus and central fire which in this philofophica) veflel, viz. the ftomach, digeftech
the victuals into a chaos, or confufcd mafs, that fo a natural feparation may be made.
It is under the influence of Jupiter, who furnilheth it with friendly heat and moif-
cure, by the liver, (the microcofmical Jupiter,) chafing and heating the right fide of
the ftomach.
T he ftomach hath alfo a latitudinal mufcle, or will, which makes the expulfive
faculty-, it is naturally cold and m oift; cold, to comprefs the fuperfluity; moift,
to make the matter flippery and fit for eje&ion, alfo to work a fuitable difpolicion in
the body. It is a neceflary operation by it, after the feparation of the pure from the
impure, the elements from the caput mortuum, or ratherfeces, is removed and carried
away, all that is needlefs or prejudicial to nature. It is under the dominion of the
Moon, (with whom you may join Venus, being of the fame nature,) whofe epitome
or microcofmical fubftitute, viz. the brain, fendeth a branch of nerves to the ftomach,
and thereby furnifheth it with humours, cold and moift, fit for expuKion.
OF
12
O F T H E H E A R T .
T H E H E A R T hath two ventricles or concavities, and the left is higher than the
righ t; the caufe o f its hollownefs is to keep the blood for his nourifhing, and the
air to abate and temper the great heat which is included and (hut up in the conca­
vities.
A s he isJol corporis, and center o f the reft o f the members and ruler o f the family,
he communicates to them life and motion, yet by his heat he attracts what is need­
ful for himfelf from the other members, as a fubfidy or tax impofed upon his fub-
jetts. And therefore to the right ventricle o f the heart cometh a vein from the
great vein, which receiveth all the fubftance of the blood from the liver; this vein
pafteth to the right ventricle o f the heart, and bringeth a great portion o f the thick-
eft and pureft blood to nourifh the heart. T he refidue that is left of this is made
more fubtle through the virtue and heat of the heart, and then fent into a concavity
or pit, in the midft o f the heart, between the two ventricles; therein it is made hot
and pure, and from thence it pafteth to the left ventricle, and there is engendered in
a fpirit that is clearer, brighter, and fubtiler, than any corporeal or bodily thing
which is engendered of the four elements, for it is a mean between the body and the
fo u l; wherefore, o f the philofophers, it is likened more to heavenly than earthly
things.
From the left ventricle o f the heart fpring twoarteries, the one having but one coat,
and therefore is called arteria venalis, which carrieth blood from the heart to the
lungs, which blood is vaporous and fit for its nourifhment, and carrieth back air
from the lungs to refrefh the heart.
T he other artery hath two coats; it is called, vena arterialis> or the great artery, o f
which fpringeth all the other arteries, that fpread to every member o f the body,
which carry the fpirits, which are the treafures o f the foul's virtue; thus it pafteth
till it come to the brain, and be made an animal fpirit; at the liver it is made nutri-
mental, and at the tefticles generative. Thus by the heart is made a fpirit o f every
kind, and (like the fun in the heavens) by his royal prefence he doth confer life and
liberty to his fuppliants.
T h e motion o f the heart is wonderful; it continues to the utmoft period o f life,
day and night, without a Angle moment’s interruption or intermiftion; and is per­
formed more than an hundred thoufand times every day. Here is, indeed, fomething
like what the mechanifts want, under the name o f a perpetual motion; and the ftu-
pendous wifdom o f the Creator is in nothing exprefted more glorioufty.

O F T H E L U N G S , L I V E R , & c.
T H E L U N G S are made of a fubftance very foft and fpongious j fupple to draw
and inforcefrom, like a pair of bellows; they arean inftrumento f refpiration, whereby
the heart is refrefhed, drawing unto it the blood, the fpirits, and the air, and difbur-
thening itfelfof thofefumesand excrements whichopprefsit. They are naturally cold
and dry, accidentally cold and m oift; naturally cold and dry, waving about the
heart, abating its heat by a refrefhing blaft; they are accidentally moift, by reafoit
o f catarrhs and rheums, which they receive from the brain.
There are three principal parts in the lungsconfiderable. Oneisa vein coming from
the liver, which bringeth with it the crude and undigefted part o f the chyle to feed
the lungs. Another is arteria venal'ts, coming from the heart, bringing the fpirit of
life to nourish the lungs. The third is ftachiaarteria, that bringeth air to the lungs,
and it pafleth through all the left part o f them to do its office.
The lungs are divided into five portions*or pellicles, three on the right fide and
two on the left fide; that, in cafe any impediment or hurt fhould happen in any one
part, the other fhould be ready to fupply the office.
But I fhall give no further defeription o f the lungs, but deferibe the liver, which
is a principal member in the little world, reprefenting the planet Jupiter, quafijuvans
pattryhot and moift, inclining towards the right fide, under the fhorc ribs. The
form of the liver is gibbous, or bunchy, on the back fide; on the other fide hollow,
like the infide o f an hand, that it might be pliable to the ftomach (as a man’s hand
is to an apple, or any thing that is round) to further its digeftion j for his heat is to
the ftomach as the heat of a fire is to the pot which hangeth over it. It is the ftore-
houfe of the blood, the fountain o f the veins, the feat of the natural nourifhing fa­
culty, or vegetative foul, engendered of the blood o f that chyle which it draweth
from the meferaique veins, and receiveth by the venaportaywhich entereth into the
concavities thereof, and afterwards is fent and diftributed through the whole body
by the help of vena cava, which arile from the bunch or branches thereof, which
are in great numbers as the rivers from the ocean.
The natural and nutrimentalfaculty hath its refidence in the liver, and is dif-
perfed through the whole body with the veins, from which are bred four particular
humours, viz. blood, choler, phlegm, and melancholy.
Blood is made of meat perfe&ly concofted, in quality hot and moift, Jupiter’s
darling, the moft perfect and neceflary humour (the other three being fuperfluities*
yet neceflary too). The blood thus conco&ed isdrawn out by thevena cava, whofe
branches, ramifying upwards and downwards, carry and convey it to all the
27. E other
H
other members o f the body for theft nourifhment, where, by a third digeftion, it is
tranfmuted into the flefh.
Choler, or bile, is made o f meat more than perfe£Iy concotted : it is the fpume or
froth of blood *
, it clarifieth all the humours, heats the body, and nourifheth the ap-
prehenfion. It is inqualicy hot and dry, it fortifieth the attractive faculty as blood
doth the digeftive; it moveth man to activity and valour: it is under the planet
Mars, whofe refidence is in the gall, which is an official member, a purfe or panicular
vefficle placed in the hollownefs o f the liver, whofe office is to receive the choleric
fuperfluities, which are engendered in the liver as aforefaid. W hich purfe, or bag,
hath three holes, or necks. By the firlt it drawcth to itfelf the choler from the liver,
thatfo the blood be not hurt by the bile, or choler. By the fecond it fendeth cho­
ler to the bottom o f the ftomach, to fortify the attra&ive faculty. And, laftly, it
fendeth choler regularly to every gut, from one gut to another, to cleanfe them from
fuperfluities and drofs.
Phlegm is made o f meat not perfectly digefted: it fortifieth the virtue expulfive,
and maketh the body fit for ejection j it is kind to, and fortifieth, the brain by its
coniimilitudewithit; it is antipathetical to the apprehenfion, and doth much injure
it, therefore phlegmatic perfons have but weak apprehenfions; it is cold and moift
in quality, its receptacle is in the lungs, it is governed by the Moon and Venus;
therefore it qualifies the bile, cools and moiftens the heart, thereby fuftaining it and
the whole body from the fiery effects which continual motion would produce.
Melancholy is thefediment o f blood: itis cold and dry in qu ality; it maketh men
fober, folid, and ftaid, fit for ftudy, or any ferious employments *
, it curbs the un­
bridled paffions incident to the fanguine complexion: it ftayeth wandering and idle
thoughts, and reduces them home to the centre; it is like a grave counfellor to the
whole body. It is governed by the planet Saturn, it ftrengtheneth the retentive fa­
culty, and its receptacle is in the fpleen; which in the body is placed on the left fide
tranfverfely linked to the flomach.
O F T H E R E I N S A N D K I D N E Y S .
T H E R E IN S and K ID N E Y S are placed within the region o f the nutrites
backwards,and they are ordained to cleanfe the blood from the watery fuperfluities;
they have two paflages: by the one is drawn the water from the venakelis, by two
veins, which are called vena emulgentes, the emulgent veins; and by the other is fent
the fame water to the bladder, and this is calledporosurithedes.
T he kidneys are made o f a hardfubftance, and full o f hard concavities, and there­
fore the fores of them are hard to cure; they are harder in fubftance than any other

flefliy member, and for that two caufes; the firft is, that they be not much hurt by
the fharpnefs o f the urine; the other is, that the urine that pafleth from them might
be the better cleanfed. The heart fendeth an artery to convey to them blood, heat,
fpirit, and life. And from the liver there cometh a vein, which bringeth nutrimental
blood. Their fatnefs is as of other members, made o f thin blood congealed by cold;
there is the greater quantity in this place, becaule it ihould temper the heat o f the kid­
neys, which they have from the biting fharpnefs o f the urine.
T h e next thing is the bladder, which is compounded o f two nervous panicles; in
complexion it is cold and dry, whofe neck is carnous, and hath two mufcles to with,
hold and to let it go *
, in man it is long, and is contained with the yard palling
through the peritoneum•
, but in women it is (horcer,and is contained with thzvulva:
the place o f the bladder is between the fhare-bone and longaon. In women it is be­
tween the aforefaid bone and the matrix. In the bladder are implanted the uterers,
which bring the urine or water from the kidneys thither, and enter into the holes
and panicles thereof, which is done by a natural motion between tunicle and tunicle,
till the urine findeth the hole o f the nether tunicle, where it entereth privily into the
concavity. And the more the bladder is filled with urine, the ftraiter are the panicles
compreffed together; the holes are not let one againft the other, lo that, if the blad­
der be never fo full, none can go back again.
This is the microcofmical ocean, into which all the rivers o f the body difcharge
themfelves. There mull needs be more than a watery fubftance in it, for many times,
in difeafes, it is plentifully made, though the patient drinketh little or nothingj and
it is obferved that creatures that drink nothing will make water. Phyficians often­
times foretel many things by its colour, thinnefs, and thicknefs. Salt you know is
hid in meats, and that plants have very much fait in them you may find by diftilling
them •, and it is very well known, that by the chymical art many kinds o f fait may be
fetched out of urine. The artificial cryfocotta is made of urine. Nitre is made of
earth moiftened with the urine and dung of living creatures.
O F T H E G E N E R A T I V E P A R T S .
T H E inftruments of generation are o f two forts, male and female; their ufe is the
procreation of mankind, the operation is by action and paflion, the agent is the feed,
the patient the blood. Although this cometh to be fpoken of in the Jaft place, yet it
might have defervedly been put in the firft; for nature regards not only the confer-
vation of itfelf, but to beget its like and conceive its fpecies. Venus hath the princi­
pal government of the members o f generation, in which members there are many parts
deferving our attention.
Firft;

Firft; o f the genitals o f m e n T h e firft thing to be confidered is, that which
artatomifts call va/a preparentia, or preparing veflels, which bring blood and vital
fpirics to the tefticles 5 they are four in number, and before they come to the tefticles
they make a curious implication, intertexture, or twifting, the one with the other,
the arteries into the veins, and the veins into the arteries, which phyficians call corpus
varicofum-, fome call it powpiniformis: this interweaving reacheth down even into the
fubftance of them; their ufe is to mix the blood and vital fpirit together, that fo they
may have a lit matter to work on.
T he tefticles are o f a white, fofr, and fpongy, fubftance, full o f fmall veins and ar­
teries ; or elfe, when humours flow to them, they could not fwell to fuch a bignefs:
their form is oval * o f their bignefs few are ignorant. Each tefticle hath a mufcle,
which the learned call ermafitr, which ferveth to pull them up in the aft o f genera­
tion, as its name in the Greek fignifieth, that fo the veflels, being flackened, may
better avoid the feed.
T h e feed being thoroughly concofted by the tefticles, there are two other fmall
pipes called vafa deftrentia they are alfo called fpermatic pores: their office is to
carry the feed to the feminary veflels, which are to keep it till need requireth its ex-
pulfion. From the ftones they arife very near to the preparing veflels into the cavity
o f the belly *
, then, going back again, they turn to the back fide o f the bladder, be­
tween it and the right gut, where they are joined to the feminal veflels, which are foft
and fpongy, fomewhat like kernels, through which pafFech the urethra^ or common
pafiage in the yard both for feed and urine.
Hiftories make mention, and experience evinceth, that fome are born without tef­
ticles, fome with one. Philip, Landgrave o f Heflia, had three; he was fo full o f feed,
and prone to venerous aftions, that his wife could not fuffer him fo often as necef-
fity urged him to it, he otherwife being chafte and honeft 5 he, relating his mind to
the priefts, with the confent o f his wife, took a concubine.
It is unneceflary for me here to deferibe the yard, and all the parts thereof, as their
form, office, texture, fympathy, See. will hereafter be more particularly treated o f in
the anatomical analyfls, in this place therefore I only mean to give a brief touch o f
the moft confiderable parts.
I now come to the generative parts of women 5 and firft o f the clytoris, which is a
finewy and hard body, much like the yard of a man, and fuflrers ereftion and falling,
caufeth luft in women, and giveth delight in copulation: Avicenna calleth it the
wand, or albatbara j and Albucafls calleth it lentigo; and Fallopious faith, chat
this hath fometimes grown fo big, that women would copulate with others like men.
This obferve, that the pafTage o f the urine is not through the neck o f the wom b;
near
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . «7
near the paflage of the urine are fourcaruncles or flefhyknobs, they are called myrti-
formes, becaufe they refemble myrtle-berries •
, the uppermoft of them is largcft and
forked, to receive the neck of the paflage of the urine; the others lie below this on
the Tides, and are to keep back the air or any hurtful thing from the womb. In vir­
gins thefeknobs arejoinedtogether by a thinfkin, interlarded with (mall veins, with
a hole in the middle about the bignefs of one’s little finger, through which pafleth the
menftruous blood : this ikin is a note of virginity, for the firft a d of copulation
breaketh it. I believe that this was that note o f virginity which God gave to the
Hebrews. Thefe knobs joined together do much refemble a rofc not quite blown,
therefore called a flower, whence came the word to deflower a virgin. If I fhould
take upon me to declare the opinions o f authors, it would prove (almoft) an endlels
ta lk ; this I ihall add, that I conceive it not a certain note o f virginity, becaufe it
may be broken without the a d o f copulation; as, namely, by applying peflaries to
provoke the menftrues, or by a defluxion o f fharp humours, & c. but it is probable
that the Jewifh virgins were more careful o f it, their reputations depending thereon.
The womb in figure is almoft perfedly round, in virgins about the bignefs o f a
walnut, yet, when a women is conceivedwith child, it dilates itfelf to fuch a capacity,
that it is able to contain the child ; the mouth o f it is no bigger than to receive the
glansof the yard, yet at the delivery makes room for the child to come out, be it
ever fo b ig : this made Galen admire, and it may be a great admiration to all, if we
confider the wonderful works of God in the creation o f m an: he who knows himfclf
may know there is an all-powerful G o d ! and therefore it was engraven with letters
o f gold over the porch of the temple o f Apollo, the god (according to the Panims)
o f knowledge and wifdom, this fentence-—Know thyfelf~-z% a falutation unto all \
fignifying, that he that would have accefs unto that divinity,, and entrance into that
temple, muftfirft know himfclf.
The womb before conception is final], becaufe the feed, being but little in quan­
tity, might be clofe embraced and cherifhed. Women have tefticles or ftones as
men have, but they differ from men’s in thefe particulars: they are within the belly
in women, in men without; they are not fo fmooth in women as in men $they are
lefs than the ftones o f men; they are not ftaid by mufcles, but by ligaments ; as
men’s are oval, they are fiattifh; they have but one ikin, men’s have four, becaufe
they are without the body, and expofed to the cold; they are more fofc and cold
than men’s are. But they are ordained both in men and women for the fame ufe,
viz. to concott feed; and, though Ariftotle denied feed in women, yet Hippocrates,
one o f the ancients of phyfic, was of this judgment >and reafonand experience con­
firm it.
27- F The
T he vafapreparentifit the preparing vefieis, and va/a defe*entia9carrying veffcls, are
o f the fame nature and office as they are in men ; they differ only in this, that they
arefomewhatfhorcer, having a fhorter way to go, the tefticles being within the belly
in women: bur, left the fhortnels of the paffage fhould hinder their operation, God
and nature have fo provided, that they are more twifted and interwoven than they
are in men, that they may the better mingle the blood and vital fpirit.
Thus have I given you a fhort defeription o f man, the mafter-piece o f God’s
•workmanfhip j and in whom is comprifed a fmall draught of all things in the uni-
verfe. Inman, as in a perfpeflive glafs, may our mother-earth wich her innumera­
ble offspring be difeovered >in him may the unruly and reftlefs waves o f the ocean
be delineated : nor doth he only epitomize the elemental world, but alfo the celef-
tia l; in him are difeovered the prudenr, majeftical, fumptuous, magnificent., honour­
able, affable, and humane, folar quality: theunfteadfaft, timorous,foon-daunted, oft-
changing, and fhifting, temper, among men, anfwers to the various motions o f the
low and oft-changing Luna. Others in profundity o f imagination, refervednefs of
words, aufterity o f a&ions, & c. are a fit portrait o f the melancholy planet Saturn.
There are yet a few in the world who are faithful lovers o f fair dealing, beneficent
to all men, doing glorious, honourable, and religious, actions; juft, wife, prudent,
virtuous, & c. of the temper o f benevolent Jupiter. There are (in our apprehen-
fions) too many of the Martial temper, who are valiant lovers o f wars, frays, and
commotions, fubjedt to no reafon, bold, confident, willingly obeying nobody, & c.
N or is Venus excluded thofe people’s affe&ions who love mirth in words and
actions, mufical, delighting in venery, drinking, and merry-meetings, who trouble
pot themfelves with ftate-affairs, nor are inquifitive after armies or navies. Nor is
Mercury without his party among us, who are fubtile and politic, excellent difpu-
tants and logicians, fharp-witted, and able to learn any thing, men o f unwearied
fancies, and fit for any employment, yet unconftant. T he planetary influence in the
good or illdifpofuion o f the air is lively reprefented in man. A healthy fanguine
conftitution, or a delicate compofure o f heat and moifture, anfwers to a ferene and
temjjerate air, with feafonable moiftening dews and fhowers, which are the fweet
influence of the Sun, Jupiter, and Venus. Thefeverifli; hot, and parching, diftem-
pers of the body, anfwer to the hot and fcorching weather occafioned by the fiery
beams of Mars. Nor is the cold, chilly, melancholy, weeping, and lamenting, dif-
pofuion of many people, lefs reprefented by the melancholy, dark, cold, and wet,
weather, proceeding from Saturn’s influx. The intellectual world hath alfo in man
its portraiture ■, witnefs the foaring contemplations of the foul o f man, which cannot
(like the body) be confined to any place, but in a moment furrounds this terreftrial

ANATOMICAL ANALYSIS o f t h e HUMAN FRAME.
O F T H E S K I N .
T H E SK IN is a membranous covering o f the body, fimilar, fpermatic, having
blood mixed with it, reddilh, white, loofe, and the inftrumentof feeling. It hath
cutaneous veins and arteries, as alfo nerves; from the lad o f which, it receives its
quicknefs o f fenfe. From the capillary veins and arteries it receives blood for
nourilhment and vital fpirit for quickening. Its temperature is cold and dry, or
rather exquilitely temperate, yet fo that it may be the judge o f feeling. The (kin
on the top o f the head is thickeft, that on the (ides thin, that on the face and palms
o f the hands thinner, that on the lips thinneft o f a ll; that on the tops o f the fingers
is mean, fo that the fenfe o f touching may be the more perfedl: its texture is flight
and very full of fmall holes or pores, for the infenfible tranfpiration o f fumes, va­
pours, and fweat. It takes its colour from the predominant humour, unlefs it be
fuch from the birth, as in ./Ethiopia. It has a double fubftance: the one is exter­
nal, called cuticuia, or the fcarf-flrin, becaufe it is placed upon the Ikin, as a cover
or defence, every where perforated with pores, without blood and without feeling:
its connexion is to the true (kin, from whence it has its figure and colour; but, in
Black Moors, the cuticuia being pulled off, the skin itfelf is white. It has no action,
only ufe, which is to fhut the pores of the skin, that the ichoous fubftancc may not
ifluefrom the veins and arteries; co defend the skin from immoderate heat or cold;
and to make it fmooth, beautiful, policed, and even. It is generated of a vifeous
and oleaginous vapour of the blood. The other is the true skin, o f which we have
firft fpoken, which is fix times thicker than the fcarf-skin; its pores will appear in
winter-time, if it be made bare, and expofed to the cold : for where they are, the
cuticuia will appear like a goofe skin. The skin receives two cutaneous veins,
through the head and neck, from the jugulars: two through the arms, breaft, and
back, from the auxiliaries: two through the lower belly, loins, and legs, from the
groins, which are confpicuous in women after hard labour, am. in fuch as have the
varices in many branches. It has few arteries, and thofe very fmall, in the temples
and forehead, fingers, ferotum, and yard.

T H E F L E S H is a fimilar, foft, thick, fubftance, well com pared, made of
blood alone, if it be red*, but, o f blood and feed, if it be white. It is four-fold,
viz. mufculous, vifcerous, membranous, and glandulous; o f which the two firft
are very red, but the two latter white. Mufculous flefh is foft and red, and that
which is properly termed flefh. Vifcerous flefh is that o f the bowels, which is the
proper fubftance o f the lungs, heart, liver, fpleen, and kidneys; it is red, hard,
fitted to prop up the veflcls, and to aflift them in their particular and various opera­
tions. Membranous fiefti is the fleftiy fubftance o f every membranous part, as in
the gullet, ltomach, guts, womb, bladder. Glandulous flefh is the flefh o f kernels;
it is white, thick, and fpongy, formed o f feed (and therefore cannot properly be
called flefh), o f which fome anatomilts make many diverfities; but the true fearcher
may find chat the glandules differ not fo much in fubftance as in their ufe and humour;
which are, firft, to fupport thedivifions o f the veflels; fecondly, to drink up fuper-
fluous humours, becaufe they are o f a hollow fpongy fubftance, and are therefore
vulgarly termed emtwflories, or cleanfers o f the noble parts, thole in the neck being
accounted cleanfers o f the head, thole in the arm-pits o f the heart, and thofe in the
groin of the liver; thirdly, to moiften the parts for their more eafy motion, or to
prohibit drinefs, fuch are thofe which are fituated by the tongue, larynx, eye-
corners, & c.
O F T H E M E M B R A N E S .
A M E M B R A N E is a fimilar, fpermatic, part; broad, foft, dilatable, white, con­
taining and inverting the parts, and carrying fenfe to them. If, being a hollow
body, it receives fomething, as the ftomach, bladder, gall, eye, it is called tunica^ a
coat ; but, if it embraces and covers a folid body, it is called mmbrana, a covering:
and thofe which cover the brain are called matings. It is indued with fenfe from it-
felf. Membranes are the only true organs o f feeling, ferving the animal fpirits to
this purpofe. Its ufe is, to inveft the parts o f the body, to defend it from injuries
by reafon o f its hardnefs and compactnefs, to give them the fenfe o f feeling, to
ftrengthen them, to join parts to parts, and to keep them united; to feparate alfo
the parts, and to clofe the mouths o f the veflcls. Some membranes are thin, fome
thick : the thin membranes alfo differ; for theperioftion o f the ribs is thinner than
the pleura; the perioftion o f the head is thinner than the pericranium» the pia
mater is thinner than the dura mater. T h e proper membrane o f the mufcles
is
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 21
is thin, and is knit unto the mufcles by moft thin filaments. Its ufe is to clothe the
mufcles, and to feparate them one from another j and to impart to them fenfe and
feeling. The thick membrane is called by fome a membranous mufclc, by others
a nervy or fatty coat; it is called fielhy, bccaufe in fome places, as about the loins,
neck, ears, forehead, & c. it retains a flefhy Jubilance; bur, in the abdomen o f a man
ripe in years, it has no fielhy appearance at all. Its temperature is hot and moift,
having its origin from blood: it is iituated under the fat, and flretchedout over
the whole body univerfally, and is the fourth covering o f the body, (but in- beafts it
is next to the Ikin:) it has no figure, but that of the body which it covers: its co-
lour is various in divers places : in the neck, forehead, and privities, it is redder than
elfewhere: in fome places it is joined to the fat infeparably, in other places it may
be feparated; and it communicates with the principal parts by the extremities o f the
veins, arteries, and nerves. It is very fenfible, fo that the rigour and trembling of
the body depends thereupon: its ufe is to give foundation to the colle&ing and ge­
nerating the fat, and to keep the fat in its due place, as alfo to divide one mufcle
from another, and all of them from the other flelh; to clothe the body, cherilh the
internal heat, and to defend it from external injuries: it flicks clofeto the fat, to the
mufcles, and to the ligaments of the bones, and is firmly joined to the back in fa-
fhion of a membrane, from whence it is faid to arife ; it is fo clofely joined to the
vmfculus latus* that in the neck and forehead it can fcarcely be feparated from it,
w h ereb y it is thought to conftitute the fame: to the Ikin it flicks by very many
veins, fome few arteries, branches o f nerves, and an innumerable quantity o f
membranous fibres.
O F A F I B R E .
A FIBR E is a fimilar fpermatic part, difperfed through the skin, flelh, and mem­
branes, to make them the more firm, and, being naturally diflended, to contrail
again in the fame manner. By reafon o f the various fuuation thereof, it is faid to
be either right, oblique, tranfverfe, or round, whereby it may not only help the
membrane, but llrengchen it, as alfo the skin and fielh or mufcles -
>and, when dilat­
ed, reduce them to their natural Hate. Each fort of fibre is faid to perform a feve-
ral allion: as, the right to attrall or draw to j the oblique to expel or thrufl forth;
the tranfverfe to retain or hold 5 and the round to constrain or bind. But thefe
allions o f the fibres are not made fo much by their own lingular virtue as by the
virtue o f the member which they ferve, or belong unto, from which they have their
fenfe and nourilhment j for o f themfclves they are fenfelefs.

A L IG A M E N T , or band, is a fimilar, fpermatic, dry, part, adhering firmly to
the bones, tying the parts o f the body mutually together. Its fubftance is folid,
white, bloodlefs, fofter than a griftle, and harder than nerves and membranes; being
of a middle fubftance between them. It is without cavity, fenfe, or motion : their
fubftance is in fome places fofter and more membranous than others, as in all liga­
ments wliich go about the joints. Their ufe is like a cord to connect or bind the
parts of the body one to another, chiefly the bones, and to keep them fo together,
that they may not be luxated or disjointed. A s to fituation, fome are within or
among the bones, as the griftly ligaments, which are thick and round: fome are ex­
ternally wound about the bones, which are thin and membranous. A s to figure,
fome are broad, which are called membranous * others round and nervous: but
they are called membranous and nervous only in refpeft to their external form or
refemblance, not to their internal efience ; for they are all void of fenfe, which they
would not be were they compofed o f the true fubftance o f a nerve or mem­
brane. A ll the ligaments are folid, none hollow, except the flender ligaments of
the womb. '
O F A C A R T I L A G E , O R G R I S T L E .
A G R IS T L E is a fimilar, fpermatic, part, drier and harder than a ligament, but
moifter and fofter than a bone, rendering the articulation the more pliable, and de­
fending feveral parts from external injuries. Some are fofter, efpecially about the
joints ■, others harder, and not much differing from the nature of a bone; and fome
are in procefs o f time turned into bones, efpecially in aged people. It is without
marrow, cavities, or fenfe, being endowed neither with nerves nor membranes. Its
matter is the fame with that o f the bones, being a moift earthy part o f the feed,
partly clammy and gluey, and partly fat, but more vifeous than fa t: its ufe is to
facilitate motion, that the bones rubbing one againft another fhould not wear and
fret *
, to defend fome parts from external injuries, itfelf being fcarcely fubjeCt to any:
to fhape parts prominent or hollow, as in the ears, larynx* & c. to fill up hollownefs
in the joints, as in the knees ; to ferve for a cover, as in the epiglottis %to fuftain or
underprop fomewhat, as the griftles of the eye-lids to bear the hairs*, and to make a
a connection orjoining o f the bones. Its fituation, magnitude, and figure, are vari­
ous, according to the bones they are joined w ith: their fubftance is fometimes
harder, as thofe which in time become boney: fometimes fofter, refembling a liga­
ment,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . '23
menr, and are therefore called griftly ligaments; yet, though it be hard, it is flexi­
ble and tough, becaufe encompafled with vifcous flimy matter. A s to their con­
nection, tome conftitute parts in themfelves, as that of the nofe; others grow to the
bones which knit them together, without any other medium, as in the fhare or
breaft-bones; or by common ligaments coming between, as in that joining called
loofe articulation.
O F A T E N D O N .
A T E N D O N is a fimilar, fpermatic, folid, part, cold and dry, having a peculiar
fubftance, continued from the beginning to the end o f a mufcle, and the chiefeft
part thereof upon which the action of the mufcle depends, and no where to be found
ouc of a mufcle. It has a nervous-like fubftance, yet extremely differing from a
nerve, white, thick, hard, fmooth, and extended according to the length of the muf­
cle, being ten times bigger than a nerve. Its figure is either folid and round, as in
the mufctdus biceps; or plain and membranous, as in the mufcles o f the abdomen,
being alfo either fhort or long, and o f a uniform fubftance in all its parts; fo that,
if it is nervous at the beginning, fo it is at the end; but fometimes it is nervous at
the end, when the head of it is fiefhy; and, if its beginning is like fmall firings,
they are united to form the tendon afterwards. The hard and ftilf tendons have
much fat about them, to foften them, that they may be the more plcafantly moved;
and therefore thofe fibres difperfed among the flelh are nothing elfe but the tendon
divided, and the tendon nothing elfe but fibres united; and therefore a tendon is
either folid, compact, and united, or elfe difgregated, levered, and divided into fibres.
United is, where the whole tendinous part appears white, and hard, cither in the
beginning, end, or middle, or In all thofe parts. Severed or divided, when produced
into innumerable fmall fibres, fcarce difcernible to the light being compared about
with flelh.
O F T H E F A T .
F A T is a fimilar, loft,oily, white, infenfible, part: made to prcferve the natural
heat, to help chylification, to facilitate motion, to moiften other parts, and to nourilh
the body in famine. Its fubftance is twofold, viz. greale and fuct, which, although
is fomewhat folid, yet, is foft and oily, as may be perceived by handling: greale
or axutigia is eafily melted, but not lb eafily congealed: f.cvmn or fuec is not lb
calily melted, but more eafily hardened. Its origin is from the thinner parts o f
the blood, fweating through the veins like dew, and congealing about the flefli:
this is the effential matter o f fat > its efficient caufe is a moift and temperate heat,
{which is alfo the quality thereof5) the caufe o f its congealing is the coldnefs of the
membranes
*4
membranes from whence it has its white colour: but this coldnefs is not fimplc,
but refpettive to other parts. Melted lead or wax will congeal in hot places, if the
heat be lefs than that heat which will melt them : hence Galen determines fat to
proceed from coldnefs, fo that the fat, thin, and light* part o f the blood, in colder
confticutions is referved; whilft in hotter bodies it turns to nutriment, fo that hot
and dry bodies are hardly ever fat. Its fuuation is immediately under the Ikin,
univerfally over the whole body; the forehead, eye-lids, and privities, excepted:
whence it is, that the fatty membrane is as large as the Ikin, and fticks firmly to it,
neither can it be divided from it without fcraping; and lb alfo it fticks to the
flefhy membrane. It cannot communicate with the principal parts, becaufe it is not
truly nourifted nor yet lives, unlefs by oppofition, as (tones do, nor is it indeed
ienfible; therefore it wants both veins, arteries, and nerves, yet all three o f them pafs
through it to the Ikin. The fat o f the belly has three veins, the external mammil­
lary, defending from above : the vena epigafirica, arifing from beneath, or out of
the crural vein, through the groin; and that coming out o f the loins having many
veins accompanied with arteries: through thefe, and the veflels o f the fkin, cup-
ping-glafles, and fcarifications, draw humours out of the inward parts. It has a
great number of kernels, which receive excrements out o f the body into themielves 5
and they are more numerous in fickly perfons, and fuch as abound with excre-
mentitious moifture. Its ufes are to cherifh the natural heat; to help the concoc­
tion o f the ftomach; to moiften hot and dry parts, fuch as the heart; to facilitate
motion in the principal parts, as in the griftles and jointings o f the greater bones,
and about certain ligaments, as alfo in the focket o f the eye, left by its continual
motion it ihould become dry and withered; to ferve as a pillow or bulwark againft
blows, bruifes, and contufions, and therefore the palms o f the hands, buttocks, and
foies o f the feet, have plenty o f fa t; to nourifh the body in time o f long fafting;
to HU up the empty places in the mufcles, and to underprop the veflels, that they
may pafs fafely; and laftly to fill up all the vacuities of the other parts, veflels, and
fkjn, that the body may be rendered fmooth, white, foft, fair, and beautiful.
Hitherto we have treated o f parts abfolutely fim ilar; thofe which are fo only in
appearance or to fenfe are in number five, viz. veins, arteries, nerves, mufcles, and
bones; o f all which we fliall now treat in order.
O F V E I N S .
A V E IN isa fimilar, fpermatic, membranous, round, long,hollow, part,every where
joined by anaftomofes to the arteries; allotted to receive and contain the blood
from them, to be farther concofted, and to be carried to the heart and liver, and to
diftribute

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . *5
diftribute it over the whole body. The original o f their difpenfation, or place from
whence they rife, is the liver, where blood is made; and that the firft fanguification
is made there, and not in the heart, is apparent, becaufe there are no paflages to con­
vey thecbylus to the heart, nor any receptacles for the excrements of the firrt con*
coftion placed by the heart j all which requifitcs are found in the liver. More­
over blood is carried from the liver to the heart, but not from the heart to the
liv er: for it cannot go out o f the heart into the liver, becaufe o f the valves, though
mediately, when it runs back out o f the arteries, it may be carried thither. Alfothe
vena cava and porta enter not into the heart, but the liver j and, in a child in the
womb, the navel-vein with blood (which nourifhes the child) goes not into the heart,
but into the liver; nor is fanguification ever hurt but when the liver is hurt. The
veins have only one tunicle, with many valves within, efpecially in the external
joints; they are nouriflied with blood, not with that contained within themfelves,
but with that from the little arteries; for (heir connexion is fuch with the arteries,
that every vein is for the mod part attended with an artery, over which it lies, and
which it touches. Galen faith, a vein is feldom found without arteries: but no ar­
tery is ever found without a vein. Their form is that o f a conduit pipe; their mag­
nitude according to their place: in the liver, and their original, they are great, be­
caufe they are hot, foft, and in perpetual motion, and becaufe all the blood in the
body pafles this way, out o f the right into the left ventricle o f the heart: in the
heart they are great, by reafon of its heat, and becaufe it is to furnifh thewholebody
with arterial bloqd, received in, and font our, by continual pulfations. The emul-
gent veins are great, becaufe of the plenty of blood, and ferofities, brought back
from the kidneys to the vena cava: but, where the fubftance o f the part is lading,
and the hcatfmall, the veins are lefs, as in the brain, bones, & c. and in all parts
towards their ends they are very fmall, and called capillary veins, being divided
minutely, fprinkled into, and for the molt part confounded with, the flefh ; by this
way the arterial blood is mediately pafled through the porous flefii to the veins»
and, by the fame way alfo, blood made o f chyle in the liver is infufed into the lit­
tle branches of the vena cava. T h e veins and arteries confpirc together, and the
veins receive out o f the arteries fpirit and blood *
, and this is apparent, becaufe, if
the veins be quite emptied, the arteries are empty alfo: moreover, by a vein opened
in the arm or hand, all the blood in the body may be drawn o u t; alio it is nectflary
in refpect of the circular motion o f the blood > and in many places it may be de*
monftrated to the eye-fight, where the conjunctions o f the veins with the arteries
are vifible. The veins are endowed with feeling both from the nerves thacare near
them, and from their own membrane, which is one only, where they are inferred
into fome bowel •

fome external chick one, borrowed from the neighbouring parts, when either they
are fufpended and carried a long way without the bowels and mufcles; or, when
they reft upon hard bodies. T his happens in the abdomen to the veins and arteries
from the peritoneum ; and in the cheft from the pleura. Their ufe is to receive the
blood not fufficiently elaborated from the arteries, and to return it to the liver and
heart, there to be more perfectly conco&ed. For neither is the venal blood, nor do
the veins carry any thing ufeful for nutrition > but they bring back ali the blood to
the heart, only by circulation, cither mediately by the liver, as the mefaraic veins *
, or
immediately, as the cava; and that either from the whole body, from the fmalleft
branches to the greateft, by the upper and lower branch, or, from the liver, whe­
ther it be there generated, or is derived from the mefaraics and arteries. Hence it~
appears, that the veins carry and re-carry the blood to the liver; and to this end
the valves of the veins do confpire, which are fo contrived, that they ftand all wide
open towards the heart, and afford an eafy paflage from the fmalleft veins to the
greateft, and from thence to the heart; but, from the heart and great veins being
fhut, they fuffer nothing to go back. T he liver fends only to the heart, the heart
only to the lungs and all the arteries; feeing therefore the blood is thus fent into
all parts, and cannot now be inftantly repaired by diet, nor return back to the heart
by the mitre-fafhioned valves of the aorta%nor abide ftill in the arteries, which are
continually moving forward the fame; nor laftly, that there can be fo much fpent
by the parts to be nouriffied: it neceffarily follows, that what remains over and
above is brought back again to the heart, and enters the veins by circulation. T he
fubftance o f the veins is membranous, that they may the more eafily ftretch and
(brink in again : they have only one tunicle which is proper to them, which is thin
and rare; it is ib thin, that through it the blood may be received after the parts are
nourilhed, and fo be re-carried to the heart, to be there again perfected. T h e valves
o f the veins are little foldings, or gates: they are made o f moft thin little mem­
branes in the inner cavities o f the veins, and certain particles as it were o f the
coats o f the veins: they are fituated in the cavities o f the veins chiefly o f the
limbs, viz. o f the arms and legs, after the glandules o f the arm-holes and groins,
beginning prefently after the rifes of the branches, but not in the rifes themfelves *
,
nor is there any o f them in the external fmall veins, becaufe they need them not;
nor in the jugulars (except two in the inner orifice, looking from above downwards),
becaufe the blood doth hardly afeend upwards; nor in the vena cava> becaufe the
valves in the divarications do fufficiently hinder the regrefsof the blood: they are
alfo found in the emulgents, and in die branches o f the mefentery, looking towards
the vena cava and pcrta} as alfo in the milky veins. They all o f them look the
fame way, one after another, towards the heart: and are placed at convenient dif-
2 tances,
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y , 27
tances, as two, three, four, or live, fingers between each, according to the length
o f the veflel. A s to their magnitude, they are greater where the plenty and recourie
o f the blood is moft vehement, being in form like the nail on a man’s finger or the
horned moon, as the figma-lhaped valvesof the heart; and in their fubftance ex­
ceeding thin, but very compact, left they fhould break by a ftrong intercourfe o f
the blood. The ufes of the valves are, 1. T o ftrengthen the veins, whereas the
arteries are otherwife made ftrong by the double coats. 2. T o ftop the too violent
motion of the blood, left it fhould move violently out o f the great veins into the
little ones, and tear them. 3. T o hinder the blood from regurgitating, or going
backwards. Hence the caufe of a varix is apparent, becaufe thick heavy blood
long retained againft the valves makes a dilatation ■, for without the valves the veins
would fwell uniformly and all of an equal bignefs, and not in the manner of varices.
T he chief veins of the whole body are of three kinds, firft, the vena cava: fecondiy
the venaporta: thirdly, vcn.c laSle.e : from which ieveral other eminent veins arife,
having particular denominations. The vena cava or magna is fo called becaufe of
its Jargenefs, bring the greateft in the whole body, and the original o f all other veins
which do not proceed from the vena porta. It takes its beginning from the liver,
where, having fpread many veins through the upper parts thereof, they are about the
top collected into one trunk, which is prefently divided into two parts, viz. the upper
or afeendant trunk, and the lower or defending trunk.
The ajeending trunk of thevena cava, which is the greater, perforates the diapbrag-
ma or midriff.\ and is fpread through the breaft, neck, head, and arms. It is carried
undivided as far as the jugulumy and has four branches; viz. 1. PbrenUay venadia-
pbragmatica; the midriff veins, on each fide one, which fend their branches to the
pericardium anddiapbragma. 2. The venacoronariaywhich is fometimes double, encom-
pafling the bafis of the heart, at whofe rife a little valve is placed to hinder the blood
returning to the trunk; and with a continued pafiage it isjoined to the artery, that
it may therefrom receive the blood, which is to return to the cava. 3. Azygosjins
pariythe folttary vein, fends chief intercoftal branches to the eight lower ribs arifing
about the fifth vertebraof the breaft, from the hinder part o f the vena cava; then,
about the fleftiy appendices o f the diapbragma^ it enters the cavity o f the abdomen,
where on the left fide it is inferted into theemulgent vein; on the right fide into the
trunk of the cava. 4, $ubclaviiyor branches o f the cava by the channel bones, are
divided into two only branches, one on Reach de; each o f which is divided into
two others, called the Jubclavii and axillaris. From the Jubclavii come forth two
ftveral branches, a fuperior and an inferior. From the fuperior proceeds, firlt, the
mufculafuperior, fpread out intothe fk'rn and mufcles o f the hinder part of the neck :
fecondiy, thejugular veins, by the Tides o f the neck; and they are either external or
internal.
internal. T he externaljugular creeps up to the neck, chin, head, and face: under
the root o f the ear it is divided into internal and external branches: the internal goes
to the mufcles o f the mouth, fauces, hyoides, & c. from this branch fpring the veins
which are opened under the tongue. T h e external is propped with kernels, and is
divided into two parts: the one is carried to the fore parts o f the face, cheeks, and
nole i and in the middle o f the forehead, being joined with a branch o f the other
fide, it makes the vein o f the forehead: the other is carried through the Tides, the
temples, and the occiput. T h e internal jugular is called apopk£lay and afeends to
the fide o f tracheato which it fends branches: and, going to the bafis o f the fkull
in its hinder part, it is divided into two branches : the greater o f which is carried
backward through the hole o f the os occipitus, and enters into the cavity o f the
auramater or thick mentnx o f the brain: the lefs enters in at the hole or Jims o f the
third and fourth pair, and is carried alfo to the dura mater. From the inferior
branch proceed five veins, the mammariay intercojlalis fuperiory mediajlinay cervicalisy
and mufcula inferior.
T h e vena axillarisyor arm-vein, when it is come to the arm-pit, is divided into
two veins, viz. thzvenacephalhay or upper branch; and the vena bafilicay or lower
branch, to which is added the mediana. T h e cephalicay or head-vein, is carried in
thefurfaceof the body between the flelhy membranes and coat o f the mufcles.
T h e baftlicay or liver-vein, is placed near a nerve o f the third and fourth pair;
and therefore furgeons in opening of it ought to be careful, left they wound it,
from whence follow great pain, fever, convulfion, and death. From the haftlicay
or lower branch, arife two veins: fir&ythoracica fuperiory which goes into the muf­
cles o f the cheft, and into women’s breafts: fecondly, thoracica inferiory which
fometimes grows out o f the fuperior, creeping all over the fide of the cheft: its
branches are joined by anajlomofts with the branches of the azygos, which proceed
out of the cheft. T h c bajilica is divided (under the tendono f the peftoral mufcle)
into three branches: the firft goes with the nerve o f the arm, the fecond is divided
into an external, which fends veins to the thumb, fore and middle fingers; and
an internal, running along the middle bone of the cubit, fending branches along the.
fingers to the internal mufcles o f the hand: the third, called fubcutaneus, at the in­
ner fwelling of the arm, is the inner branch o f the cephalieay which conftituces in
part the median.
T h e defending trunk o f the vena cavay which is fmaller and narrower, pro­
ceeds undivided as far as the fourth vertebra o f the loins; and fends forth the
four following branches, i. Vena adipofay which furnifh the coats o f the
kidneys, andtheirfat, the finifter being commonly higher than the dexter. 2. The
enndgensy or emulgent veins, defending to the kidneys by a fhort and crooked
paflage,

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y , z9
palTage, bringing back the blood, being purified, from the kidneys to the vena cava*
3* The fpermatiea, or fpermatic veins, the right arifing a little below the rife of the
emtlgeni; and the left arifing from the emulgent, fcldom from the cava, fometimes
from both. 5. Ijmbans, or loin-veios, fometimes two, three, or four, which are
carried between the four vertebra o f the loins. 6. After thefe branches the trunk
goes towards the osfacnm, and at the fourth vertebra o f the loins it goes under the
aorta, and is divided into two branches, called rami ilii or iliaci, becaufe they go over
the osiliiand ospubis, to the thigh: thefe iliac branches, as foon as they have left the
cavity of the belly, are called vena crnrales, or the leg-veins.
From the rami ilii arife two veins: firft, mufculaSuperior, which (ends veins to
the peritoneum, and mufcles o f the loins and belly: fecondly, vena facra, which is
fometimes fingle, fometimes double, for the marrow o f the osfacrum* From thence
the ramusHiatus is forked out on each fide into the external greater and internal
imaller. From the internal fmaller proceed two veins; firft, mufculamedia without,
which fends veins to the mufcles on the outfide o f the hip, and (kin o f the buttocks:
fecondly, bypogaflr'tca, which is fometimes double, fending veins to many parts o f
the bypogaftricum, as to the bladder and its neck, to the penis or yard, to the muf-
cles o f the intefitnumreftum, whence are the bemorrboides externa, and to the lower
fide and neck of the womb, whence are thole veins by which the courfes flow
in maidens and women with child ; but, when the courfes are naturally voided,
they flow from the arteries, as appears from their excellent colour and the common
office of the arteries. From the external greater proceed three veins: 1. Epigaf-
trica, which fend branches to the peritoneum and mufcles o f the abdomen the
principal parts afeend under the right mufcles to the mammaria, with whom they
are often joined about the navel. 2. Pudenda, which fends to the privities in men
and women, and goes acrofs to the middle o f the ospubis* 3. Mufculainferior, which,
palling over the hip, ferves the mufcle and Ikin of the part; from hence downwards
theiliacbranches, as foon as they have left the belly, are called crurals*
The cruralveins are intervoven with little glandules in the bending o f the thigh,
and from them proceed fix branches. 1. The ifebias or ifibiatica minor, which is
oppofite to the fapbana, and ferves the Ikin and mufcles o f the hip. 2. Ifebias or
ifcbtatica major fends branches to the hip, and a part to the mufcles of the calf, and
then divides itfelf into ten branches, beftowing a couple upon each toe. 3. Poplitea,
the ham-vein, made o f a double crural branch, mixed together: it runs ftraight
under the Ikin behind, through the midft o f the bending of the ham to the heel,
and fometimes to the Ikin of the external ancle. 4. Suralis, a great vein, and is di­
vided into the external and fmaller and internal and greater > and each of them again
28. I into

into exterior and interior; all which fend veins to the mufcles o f the calves o f the
legs. Thofe on the back o f the foot, being mixed with the poplitea, make the
fame various texture o f veins, which are lecn under the fkin. 5. Sep<ena, (fo termed
from its apparency,) or vena maleoli, the ancle-vein, is long and large, carried on
through the infide o f the thigh, between the fkin and membrana carnoja, to the knee;
and from thence, by the inner part o f the leg, it runs to the inner ancle, and to
the upper part of the foot and toes. 6. The mufcula, a vein arifing from the trunk
or branch hidden among the mufcles: it is double, and remarkable, giving veins
to the mufcles o f the thigh. A s to the veins o f both arms and legs, it is to be
noted *
, firft, that their various branches fend diverfe twigs outward to the fkin,
called cutaneous veins: fecondly, that even the grand branches are varioufly diftri-
buted in every perfon, being feldom in one man as they are in another: and that the
right arms or legs rarely agree with the left. In opening the veins o f the foot,
you may indifferently make choice o f any, feeing they are all derived from one and
the fame crunk.
The vena portay or gate-vein, is the next great vein to the cava; its prime
original is the vena umbilkaltSy or navel-vein* the firft o f all the veins arifing from
feed, and that by which the child is nourifhed in the w om b; afterwards it riles
out of the hollow part o f the liver, where with many roots it is inferted. The
trunk, before it is divided into lower branches, fends two i'mall veins to the gall­
bladder, called vena cyfiica; and another vein to the ftomach called gajlrica
dextra, which is divided about the lower orifice o f the ftomach. Afterwards the
trunk is divided into two eminent lower branches, viz. the fplenetic, and the
mejmterk. Ramus fpleneticus goes into the fpleen. Before it is divided, it fends
from itlelf two upper branches to the ftomach, firft gajlricaJiniJlra, or majory(the larg-
eft of all the ftomach veins,) which afterwards conftitute the coronaria; then it fends
lower branches, one to the omentumor caul, and one to the pancreas. Afterwards the
trunk of the ramus fplenicus is divided into the upper and lower branches: the
former produces the vas breve and other little branches carried into the fpleen:
the latter produces, 1. Gaflroepiplokaftnijiray which runs out upon the bottom o f
the ftomach, and gives many branches both to the ftomach itfelf and to the
omentum. 2. Vena epiplois, which runs out upon the fame parts; and a multitude
o f other fmall branches, which are fent up and down all over the fpleen. The
mejenterk branches o f the vena portay called ramus dexter, whofe principal part
goes into the mefentery, fends forth two veins; one to the middle of the duodenum,
from whence certain capillary twigs go through the pancreas and omentum upwards;
and another to the right fide of the ftomach and omentum. Afterwards the trunk
Of
C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
AND F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 3l
of the ramus mejentericus is divided into two parts, the right and the left. The
iight*hand branch is two-fold; i. Gaftroepiploica dextra, which runs to the bottom
o f the ftomach, and joins with the gaftroepiploica finiftra, fending branches
through the omentum and ftomach. 2. The right mefenter'tc branch icfelf, which is
divided into 14 namelefs little branches, and thole again into innumerable other
little veins, which are called meferaic veins, and arc difperfed into the jejunum,
ilecn, cacum, and part o f the colon. T h e left-hand mefenteric branch, firft, fends,
out the vena bamorrboidalis interna, which diffufes itfelf through the mefentery, and
fends forth branches to the fpleen, womb, and inteftimm reftum, which is the in­
ternal hemorrhoidal vein: hence appears a communion between the womb and
tht hemorrhoidal of the anus, and that pofllbly the courfes or terms may be con­
veyed alfo this way. Afterwards this left mefenteric branch fpreads icfelf abroad
into the left and centrical part o f the mefentery, whence comes vena c.ecalis, which
goes to the blind g u t; and ramus mefocolicus, which from the left fide o f the
ftomach goes to the colon. Vena cava firft receives the cruder blood from the
arteries, and remits it to the heat: the vena porta takes the blood not fufliciently
elaborated, from the arteries, and carries it to the liver, for the more perfect con-
cottion and feparation o f the choier.
T he hemorrhoidalveins are fituate in the fundament or inteftimm return, and arc
of two kinds, either internalor external. The internal proceed from the venaporta;
the external from the vena cava, with which the hemorrhoidal atterics are a(-
fociated, and through which the humours to be evacuated are carried off. In
their evacuation, the internal have a flux, not very plentiful, attended with a great
deal of pain; the external emit a flux lo large as may fometimes caule death, or fome
gtievous difeafe, but without any pain at all. The internal defeend alone, not
affociated with arteries: however the arteries are cither hidden, or they deixrnd on
arteries not far off: the external defeend with arteries to them ufclesof the anus:
and therefore the external hemorrhoids may more proj>erly be called vafa hemor•
rhoidalia, whereby the arteries are included with the veins.
T he venalafiee, or milky veins, are peculiar pafluges, much differing from
the meferaies: they are called latte, from milk which they refemble in whitenefs,
foftnefs, andfatnefs. Their fituation is in tht abdomen, where they are for the mod
pare accompanied with fat, to cherifli the natural heat for the attraction and
concoftion of the chylus. T he great tableau vein, lying between the arteria aorta
and the vertebraof the loins, covered with fat, runs upwards, and above the heart,
afeends by the gullet to the leftfubclavian vein, where it ends in one, two, or three,
branches: here a moft thin valve occurs at the very end o f the vein, looking
inwardly,
inwardly, that the chyle might not run back again, or run farther into the arm : out of
thisfnbclavial they defcend by the afcending trunk o f the vena cava into the right ven­
tricle of the heart, that there, by the help of the heat and the natural faculty, they may
be changed into blood. Their fubftance is the fame with that o f a vein itfelf, which
it refembles in all things, the milky juice only excepted ; having but a fingle mem­
brane, though in the mefentery they receive from it another external coat. They
grow continually one to another, of an unequal magnitude; being for the moft
part fmall, left the thick and unprofitable parts of the chyle fhould go into them;
or left they fhould make a diftribution thereof too fuddenly : they are alfo infinite
in number, difperfed through the liver, mefentery, pancreas, and bowels. They
are colder and moifter than the ordinary veins; very thin, exceeding fubtil, (where
they enter into the body of the liver,) tender, fmooth outwardly, rare, but rough by
reafon of their fibres within them. Their a&ion and ufe are, i. T o carry or convey
the chyle to the liver. 2. T o digeft and better conco& the chyle, to make it make it
more fit to receive the form o f blood in the liver: for the chyle is not changed at all
till it comes into the liver, where it grows red by little and little. 3. T o fhew a
ready way for the diftribution of the chyle: that the blood is made in the liver, not
in the veins; and that the fucking o f the veins is no caufe o f hunger, becaufe none
are carried to the ftomach. T o fhew the caufes o f fome difeafes, before obfeure; as,
o f the chylousflux: o f hypochondriacmelancholy: o f an atrophia, or pining away of the
body for want o f nourifhment, by reafon o f the glandules o f the mefentery being
filled with fchirrous fwellings: o f intermitting agues quartered in thtmefar/eum, &c.
T he beft method o f tracing the general courfc o f the veins, is to begin with the
main trunks, or primary veins, and end with their ramifications and capillary extre­
mities, according to their feveral divifions and fubdivifions. In this manner they
are traced in the annexed plate, where fig. 1 reprefents the veins as attached to the
body; fig. 2, the veins abftra&ed from the body; and fig. 3, the pulmonary vein :

O F T H E A R T E R I E S .
A N A R T E R Y is a fimilar, fpermatic, membranous, long, round, hollow, part,
a common pipe-like organ, confiding o f a double coat proceeding from the heart,
joined every where to the veins, by the afliftance o f many ofculations, containing
and carrying the nutritious blood and vital fpirits to all parts o f the body. It is
called artma> from its containing and preferving air or fpirit, and therefore the an­
cients, as, Hippocrates, Plato, and Ariftotle, call the wind-pipe arteria magna -
■ but
Galen makes a diftin&ion, and calls the wind-pipe afpera arteria, the rough artery,
and thofe of which we here fpeak arteria levesythe fmooth arteries, which Ariftotle
calls fometimes venam aortam, and fometimes limply aorta. Their matter is a cold
clammy part of the feed : the original o f their difpenfation is the heart, and they
proceed out o f the left ventricle thereof, and not the middle (as Ariftotle would
have it); and therefore the aortay or arteria magnay proceeds particularly from the
left ventricle: but the pulnmiac arteria (falfely called by the ancients vena arteriofa)
from the right ventricle. Their ufe is, firft, to carry the vital blood and fpirits,
made in the heart, to all parts o f the body: fecondly, to breed animal fpirits in the
noble ventricle of the marrow, (to wit) the brain: thirdly, for the nourifhment o f
the body, and all its parts, which are only nourifhed by the arterial blood, and not
by the venal: fourthly, to carry the excrements o f the body and blood, either to the
outward parts o f the body, or to the kidneys, or mefentery or womb, or hasmor-
rhoidal veins, & c. The arteries flow only by pulfation: whereby, firft, the heat
o f the parts is cooled and tempered: fecondly, the nourifhing arterial blood is caft
continually into the fmalleft and moft remote arteries: which is proved by the
continual pulfation o f the heart, which drives the blood into the greater arteries:
thirdly, the ftagnation o f the venal blood is hereby prevented: for the pulfation
keeps it always in motion, by forcibly cafting the more than neceflary arterial blood
for nourifhment into the veins, which convey it to the heart for fupply, left it
ihould be deftitute o f its fanguine humour by its continual expulfion. T h e
caufe o f the pulfation, or pulfe, is, according to Bartholine, from both the blood
filling, and the faculty of the arteries directing. But I judge the caufe to be from
fpirit, wind, air, or breath: for, i f you blow with a reed or pipe being put into
28. K water.
C U L P E P E R S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,

water, it will make an apparent pulfation or bubbling, much more if the water was
contained in long narrow veflels with valves, that it might not return b a ck ; but,
if you fuck with the pipe, then it runs fmoothly, without pulfation or leaping:
therefore the blood in the arteries flows with pulfation, from the expulfive faculty
o f the heart, caufed by its fpirits •
, but it flows in the veins fmoothly, or without pul­
fation, becaufe it is fucked or drawn back again by the attractive faculty, caufed
by want o f fpirits, or blood, or their being wafted by the heart’s perpetual expul-
fation. T he fituation o f the arteries is deep, always under the veins both in the
external and internal parts, the abdomen, a little below the kidneys, only except­
ed j for, after that the vena cava and aorta defending from the diapbragma have pair­
ed the region o f the kidneys, the cava hides itfelf under the aorta, through all that
region, till they pafs out o f the abdomen *
, and then the artery again hides itfelf
under the cava. The magnitude o f the aorta is very great, but the defendant part
is greater than the afeendant, becaufe the number o f the internal parts is greater
than of the external. The number of the arteries is lefs than o f the veins, becaufe
the paflfage o f the blood is quick through the arteries, but flow through the veins;
but there are more arteries than we can well difeern, becaufe the capillary arteries
are very much like the veins. Their fubftance is membranous, fo that they can be
both diftended and contracted more than the veins*, and it confifts o f two peculiar
tunicles-, the exterior is thin, foft, and rare, like the tunicle o f a vein; the interior
is compaCt, hard, and very thick, five times thicker than the tunicle o f the veins;
that thereby the arteries may be ftrong to endure their perpetual motion, and to
keep in their thin and fpirituous blood, which would foon vanifli and fly away.
T he artcria nmgna, oxaorta, the great and chiefeft artery, comes from the left ven­
tricle o f the heart, with a wide orifice *
, it has a double tunicle, the innermoft o f
which is five times thicker, left, by continual pulfation about the hard and folid
l>arts, it might incur an incurable rupture. From the ventricle o f the heart, before
it perforates the pericardium, it fends forth to the heart itfelf the coronary artery,
which compafles the bafis o f the heart, fometimes finglc, fometimes double. A f­
terwards, coming through the pericardium, or heart-bag, it is divided into two
trunks, the fmaller afeending, and the greater defeending.
T h e fmaller or afeending trunk o f the aorta, or artcria vtagtta, refting upon the
wind-pipe, provides for all the parts about the heart, and is divided into two fub-
clavial branches, the latter rifing lower, and going more obliquely to the arm ; the
other, before they go out o f the thorax, (for afterwards they are called axillares,)
produce the intcrcofiales fuperiores, projier to three or four upper ribs: from their
upper part arife four arteries: i. mamnarut, which go to the paps; 2. cervicaks,
which
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y , 35
which go to the mufcles o f the neck ; ^.arteria mufcuUy which are approximate to
the jugular veins; 4. the carotides, or fleep-arceries, which are two, unequal, and af-
cend upwards to the head by the fides o f the wind-pipe, being knit to the internal
jugulars: when they come to the fauces, before they entei the fcull, they give
branches to the larynx and tongue, and then they divide themfelves into the carotis
externa and carotisinterna. The carotis externaybeing the fmaller, furnilhes the cheeks
and mufcles of the face: at the root o f the ears it is divided into two branches-
y
the firft is fent to the hinder part of the ear, whence arife two other branches,
which go to the lower jaw, and the root o f all the lower teeth: the fecond goes to
the temples, the forehead, and mufcles o f the face. The carotis interna at the
faddle of the osJthamoidesy under the dura mater, makes the reta m:rabiky then
pafTes through the dura mater, and fends forth two branches: tire firft, which is the
fmaller, goes with the optic nerve to the eyes: the fecond, which is the greater, af-
cends to the fide of the glandulapituitaria> and is diftributed through the pia mater
and thefubftance of the brain.
When thefubclavialbranches have left the breaft or thorax, they are called axillares,
and carry nourifhment to the outward part o f the breaft, and to the whole arm. From
the axillares arife the thoracica fuperfor, or upper breaft-artery •, thoracica inferior, or
lower breaft-artery j thefcapularis, or fhoulder-blade artery. From the upper part
of the fame axillaries arifes the hitmeraria : the remainder goes from the axillary on
each fide to the arm ; where it is carried along through the arm, defending.be­
tween the mufcle, with a vein and nerve o f the arm. Under the bending o f the
elbow, it is divided into two branches, the upper and the lower, which accompany
the branches o f the vena cavayand are called by the fame names. T h e upper goes
right forwards through the middle to the wrift, where the pulfe is commonly fe lt:
from thence, proceeding under the ring-fhaped ligament, it beftows branches upon
the thumb, fore-finger, and middle-finger. The lower branch runs through the
ulna to the wrifts, and lends twigs to the ring or little fingers, and fo proceeds to
the wrift beneath, where the pulfe may alfo be felt, efpecially in fuch as are lean,
and have a ftrong pulfe * but the beating of the pulfe is much better felt in the
upper branch, that being lefs covered or hid by the tendons.
T he defeending trunk o f the aorta fends out branches from itfelf unto the thorax,
abdomen, and thighs. From the thorax it fends forth two arteries: 1. the intercof.
talesinferioresy which runs to the intervals o f the eight lower ribs, and the neigh­
bouring mufcles: 2, the phrenicay which fends to the diapbragma or midriff, and
pericardium or heart-bag. The reft o f the trunk pierces through the clifc o f the
feptum,
feptim, and fends ramifications through the abdomen •
>fome o f which go along with
branches o f the venaporta \ others the branches o f the vena cava.
Afterwards the arteria magna, or aorta, haftens the beginning o f the os factum,
where it goes above the vena cava, and no longer under, left, by reafon o f its con­
tinual motion, it Ihould be hurt againft fome bone; and here it is called the iliac
artery. It is divided like the vena cava into two iliac trunks, and each trunk into
3n inner and lefs branch, and into an outward and greater, which go to the thigh.
Thefe trunks fend out on each fide fix branches: i. thefacra, immediately after the
bipartition; 2. mufcula inferior: 3. bygogaftrica : 4. umbilicalis; which laft three come
from the inner trunk: 5. epigqflrica * 6.pudenda: which two laft come from the ex­
terior trunk.
T h e reft o f the artery (out o f the abdomen), being carried to the thigh, changes
its name, and there makes the crural arteries; from whence on each fide fpring bran­
ches above and under the ham. A bove the ham, from the outward part o f the
trunk : 1. mufculacruralis externa, to the foremoft mufcles o f the thighs, from the in­
ner : 2. mufculacruralisinterna9which go to the inner mufcles o f the thigh *
, and this
is mixed at the knee with a little twig o f the hypogaftrica. Under the ham arife, 1.
popliteus, which goes to the hinder mufcle o f the thigh : 2. fitralis, which is divided
into, firft, tibicusexterior; fecond, pofterior altus; third,pofieriorhumitis, for the mufcles
o f the le g : 3. the laft o f them is fent to the foot and toes, all along accompanied with
the veins, from which they borrow their names. T o enter into a more minute detail

O F T H E N E R V E S .
A N E R V E or finew is a fimilar, fpermatic, membranous, long, and white, hol­
low part: a common organ, ferving to carry the animal fpirits into all parts o f the
body for fenfe and motion. Its efficient caufe is the vis mrvijica, the nerve-making
power or faculty: its matter is a cold and clammy part o f the feed. Their original
difpenfation is from the medulla oblongata, partly as it is within the fkull, and
partly as it is in the back-bone. Their end and ufe is to carry the animal faculty
with the animal fpirits from the brain, for the fenfe and motion of the whole
body. And therefore the nerves inferred into the parts, give either fenfe alone, or
both fenfe and motion, there being neither without help o f a nerve; for, a nerve
being cut, the fenfe and motion o f the part is loft. But this fenfe or motion is ac­
cording to the parts where they are diffeminated, becaufe the nerves o f themfelves
are neither fenfitive or m otive: if they are inferred into mufclcs, (the organs of
motion,) they are termed nervi motorii, motive nerves: if into the inftrumentof fenfe,
rterai Jentientia, the fenfitive. Their fituadon is for fecurity, deeper than that o f an
artery: their magnitude is various, according to the nature o f the organ, and
dignity of the aftion. Thofc of the eyes arc great, bccaufe o f the adtion; thofe
of the limbs, very great and thick, becaufe of their diftance and magnitude5 thofe
of the fenlory parts are in a middle proportion ; thofe of the neareft parts, as in
the mufclcs of the face, are the fmalleft of all. The number o f the nerves are
taken from their conjugations or pairs, and arc fo called, from their coupling or
being double, for that they fprout out on both Tides, except the laft or lowcft, pro­
ceeding from die fpinal marrow. T h e form or figure o f the nerve is long, round,
and fmooth, like conduit pipes: folid to appearance, having no fuch hoHowncfs as
the veins and arteries have; but they have cavities or pores, for the carrying oft the
animal fpirits, though not perceptible to the eyes. The fubftance o f all the nerves
is compofed of many nervous fibres, which grow mutually together by little mem­
branes* and this fubftance is thought to be three-fold: 1. the internal white and
marrowifh, from the marrow of the brain, but more compact and thickened: 2.
an inner coat, from the pia mater; 3. an outward coat, from the dura mater \ but
thefc things fenfe cannot difeover. The fubftance o f the nerves are alfo either
harder or fofter: the harder are fuch as either go a great way, or through feme
hard body, or by a crooked way, or are ordained for motion, which requires ltrength;
29. £, and
and all pares which have voluntary motion have hard nerves, for that which is
hard is fitted to aft, that which is foft to fuffer: the fofter nerves are fuch as are
the fhorteft, and which belong to the organs o f the fenfes, as the feeing, tafting,
hearing, and fmelling, which laft are the fofteft o f all > and thefe require foft nerves,
as being the objefts o f fuffering. A s their ufe is to carry the animal fpirits and
faculties into all parts for fenfe and motion} fo, if they be obftrufted in their ori­
ginal, or beginning, or totally, they both perifh, and an apoplexy is caufed: if the
obftruftion be but in part, then one part is deprived o f fenle and m otion: if they
are cut aiunder, the motion o f the part into which they are inferted is lo ft: more­
over, the nerves difFufe animal light into the parts, by which they are direfted in
their operations. Hence it appears how neceflary ic is for a phyfician to know the
nerves, their original, differences, and diftribution, that he may underftand to what
part o f the fpbm dorft topic medicaments are to be applied, when fenfe or motion is
hurt in the face, neck, arms, hands, mufclcs o f the belly, womb, bladder, anus,
yard, thighs, legs, or feet. Moreover the caufe o f the gout feems chiefly to be the
extravafating of the nervous juice*, for the nervous juice, being over-heated or rari-
fied by too much heat, cannot be contained in its proper place*, but feeking more
room flies out o f the folid capacity of the nerve (its proper domicil) into the hol­
low of the nerve, the channel of the animal fpirits, thereby interfering with them,
caufing an extenfion of the nerve, oppofition, and confequently pain. In the an­
nexed plate all the nerves are delineated, agreeable to the following defeription and
arrangement.
T h e nerves o f the brain are nine pair. i. T he olfaftory pair, (fig. 2.)<?#, which,
paffing through the os cribrofum, are fpread over the membrane o f the noftrils.
2. The optic pair, bb, which by their expanfion form the retina o f the eye. 3. The
motary pair of the eyes, c c, each of which is divided, near the orbit, into fix parts,
cr branches \ of which, in human lubjefts, the firft branch goes to the elevator
palpebral; the fecond, to the elevator o f the eye; the third, to the depreflor ; the
fourth, to the adducent! the fifth to the inferior oblique m ufclei and the fixth
into the tunics o f the eye *
, but, in other animals, they are divided much otherwife.
4. The pathetic pair, d d, which are very fmall, and run to the trochlear mufcle o f
the eye. 5. The guftatory pair, which are very large, and divided within the cra­
nium into three branches,//, immediately under the dura m ater: o f thefe the firft
branch, called the ophthalmic, runs to various parts o f and about the eye, the eye­
lids, the mufclcs of the forehead and nofe, and the integuments o f the face. The
fecond branch may be called the fuperior maxillary one, as being finally diftributed
through all parts of the upper jaw , the lips, nofe, palate, uvula, gums, teeth: a
branch
38 C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
branch o f it alfo runs to the ear, and, joining with a branch o f the feventh pair,
forms the chorda tympani. The third branch may be called the maxillaris inferior,
as being diftributedover thefeveral parts o f the lower jaw, the tongue, and other
parts of the mouth *
, whence the whole pair o f nerves has obtained the name o f par
guflatorium♦, though a great part o f them ferves to very different purpofes, and is
carried to parts that have nothing to do with tailing. 6. T he abducent pair,£ g>
except a branch for the formation o f the intercoftal nerve, is wholly carried to the
abducent mufcle o f the e y e ; whence its name. The intercoftal nerve (fig. 1 and
2) i i /, //, my& c. is formed either o f ramifications o f the two preceding nerves,
or only o f thole o f the fixth pair. It makes its way out o f the cranium by the
paftage o f the internal carotid, and defeends near the eighth pair through the neck ;
and thencethrough the breaft and abdomen, even to the |>elvis ; and, in its way,
makes various plexufes and ganglia, and fends branches to almoft all the parts con­
tained in the breaft and abdomen. 7. The ruditory pair,££, arife with two trunks;
the one of which is called the portio dura, or hard portion*, the other the portio
mollis, or foft portion. This lafl enters the foramen o f the os petrofum, and
thence through various little apertures gets into the labyrinth o f the ear, where it is
expanded over all its parts, and conftitutes the primary organ o f hearing. The
harder portion, paffing the aqu^dudt of Fallopius, fends back one branch into the
cavity o f the cranium; it alfo fends off another branch, which helps to form the
chorda tympani; and others to the mufcles o f the tympanum. T h e reft o f this
pair goes to the external ear; the pericranium, the mufcles o f the os hyoides, the
lips, the eye-lids, and the parotids. 8. The par vagum, k k k, with the acccjjorius
o f W illis, pafs out near the lateral finufes o f the dura mater; and, defending
through the neck and thorax to the abdomen, fend out branches by the way to the
larynx, the pharynx, the heart, the lungs, and efpecially to the ftomach. It alfo
fends off from the upper part o f the thorax large branches, which are varioufly im­
plicated in the neck, thorax, and abdomen, with the linguals, the cervicals, and the
intercoftals. 9. The lingual pair go immediately to the tongue, and are called by
fomethe motory nerves o f the tongue ; but, by others, with more juftice, the gul-
tatory nerves.
W e are toobferve, fays Heifter, that the pair o f nerves, which the generality of
writers have called the tenth pair o f the head, are, for many unanfwerable reafons,
to be properly called the firft pair o f nerves o f the neck. O f the nerves which
arife from the fpinal marrow there are pro|>erly thirty-two pair. T h o feo f the
neck are no lefs than eight pair; and from them there are innumerable branches
diftributed through the mufcles o f the head, the neck, the fcapula, and the* hu
merus,

fourth, and fifth, pair, are formed the nerves o f the diaphragm 5 and the fixth,
feventh, and eighth, pair, together with P P , the firft pair o f the back, form the fix
robuft nerves o f the arm and hands. T o this divifion is the acceftbry fpinal nerve
o f W illis to be referred, which arifes about the origin o f the third or fourth pair.
T h e nerves o f the back are twelve pair, marked P P , Q_Q_, R , S, See. to Z , and
«, $
>See. which, befides the branch they give to the brachial nerves, run entirely in
the fame furrow along the courfe o f the ribs, and are difperfed over the pleura, the
intercoftal, pe&oral, and abdominal, mufcles,the breafl, and other partsof the thorax.
T h e nervesof the loinsarefive pair, marked t, <p,«, r,©; with their branches, x t 4*,
& c. Thefe are in general difperfed over the loins, the peritonaeum, and the integu­
ments and mufcles o f the abdomen: and, befides this, their firft pair often gives,
on each fide, a branch to the diaphragm. T he fecond pair, after inofculating with
the branches o f the firft, third, and fourth, pair, forms the crural nerves, 6 6, 7 7 ,
8 8, 8cc. which are diftributed over the anterior part o f the th igh : and, in the fame
manner, a branch is formed o f the conjunctions o f the fecond, third, and fourth,
pair, which pafleth through the great foramen o f the os pubis to the ferotum, the
tefticles, and the adjoining parts. The fourth and fifth pair o f the nerves o f the
loins, joining with the firft, fecond, third, and fourth, pair o f the os facrum, com-
pofe the nerve called ifchiatic, which isthe largeft in the body, being marked 3 3 ,
in fig. 2. it defeends along the hinder part o f the thigh, and its branches are diftri­
buted over the whole leg, the foot, and toes; being marked 15, 17, 18, & c.
T he nervesof the facrum form five or fix pair, though not always determinately
and regularly fo: they pafs through the foramina o f this bone, and the fuperior
ones of them, as already obferved, compofe the ifchiatic nerve; and what remains is
difperfed, in a multitude o f ramifications, over the parts contained in the pelvis, the
inteftinum rectum, the bladder, the parts of generation, and the parts adjacent.
They are marked, in the figure, a, & c.

O F T H E M U S C L E S .
A M U S C L E is a fimilar, fpermatic, fanguinous, membranous, flefhy, fibrous,
part, and the inftrument o f voluntary or free motion. It is compofed o f fibres, for
theintention o f the motion; o f fiefli, for the fubftance; o f tendons, which perform
the
A 'U
'V
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 4*
the a&ion; of arteries, by which it is nouriflied ; of veins, which carry back the
fuperfluous nourifliment; of nerves, which give fenfe, and convey the motive fa­
culty to the brain; of membranes, which encompafs and keep the mufcles together;
of fat, which moiftens them, and keeps them from being dried by too much mo­
tion. The fibres and flelh are only extended according to the ftraight pofition of
the fibres ; the tendon is in the beginning and end; the arteries and veins run
through the fubftance o f the mufcle •
, the nerve, as foon as it is entered into the lub-
ftance, is difperfed into a great number of twigs, which end in it, and become in-
confpicuous ; the membrane is proper to the mufcle only, and fprings either from
the tendons, or is framed by nature in the firft conformation o f the parts ; the fat
lies in void fpaces to prevent a vacuum or emptinefs. The aftion o f a mufcle is
voluntary or free motion. This a<
5tion or motion is three-fold: firfi, when the
mufcle is contracted towards its head within itfelf, thereby relaxing the oppofite
mufcle: fecondly, when the motion is tonic, fo that being contracted it remains fo;
thefe two motions are primary, perfe, and not accidental: thirdly, when (after con­
traction) it is relaxed, or reftored to its former pofition, which motion is acciden­
tal, and proceeds from another ; and therefore mufcles are always placed one againft
another as antagonifis. The manner of this aClion or motion varies according to the
variety of parts*, for, in the throat, it is fwallowing; in the arm, bending and
ftretching forth; in the anus, expulfion and retention; See. T his motion is vo -x
luntary or free; for we can haften or flacken, make or ftop, this motion, as we
pleafe: but there are iome lingular mufcles, as o f the infide o f the ear, the midriff,
the mufcles o f the chefi, and o f the eye-lids, whofe motion is partly voluntary,
partly natural, becaufe they often perform their aCbions when wc have no thought
or will thereto. Thofe mufcles which only perform continual or ftrong motions,
which are all fuch as are appointed for moving the bones, have tendons; but thofe
which move other parts, as the tongue, lips, forehead, face, bladder, anus, See.
feldom have an y; for the mufcles move themfelves only, as thofe o f the anus and
bladder : or they move with themfelves and the skin alfo, as in the lips, forehead,
and face: or they move a bone, and fuch, by reafon o f the ftrong motion, require
tendons. The diverfity o f this motion comes from the diverfity o f the fituation:
fo a ftraight mufcle has a ftraight m otion; a tranfverfe, a tranfverfe motion ; an
oblique, an oblique motion *
, and that which compafies a part has an orbicular
motion, as the fphinCters. The efficient caufe o f thefe aClions, or motions, is the
foul of the creature, inclined thereto by the appetite or will: now the foul ulcs
three inftruments to perform the aCtion: firft, the brain, to receive the charge;
fecondly, the nerve, to carry it to the m ufcle; thirdly, the mufcle, to perform the

adlion itfelf. T he differences o f mufcles are various: firft:, from their fubftance ;
iome are flelhy, as levcral o f the tongue and larynx*, fome membranous, as the con-
ftriAores o f the nofe ; fome partly flelhy, partly nervous, as the temporal m ufcles:
fccondiy, from their quantity; the greateft o f all is the firft o f thofe which extend
over the breaft; for it afeends from the end o f the os facrum, to the firft vertebra
o f the thorax: the leaft o f all is the internal mufcle o f the ear: thirdly, from their
fituation: fourthly, from their figure, or form, or number, as the mufcle del-
toides; the mufcle bicipites, having two heads s alfo fome have two tails: fifthly,
from their beginnings; fome proceed from bones, fome from cartilages, as thofe
o f the larynx; feme from tendons, as the lumbricales: fixthly, from the action;
fome move by fympathy, as the fraternty or congeneres\ or by antipathy, as the
antagonift<e; fome move thcmfclves only, as the fphinfters *
, fome move other parts *
,
fome have only one motion, as moft o f the mufcles ; feme have more than one, as
the mafllter and trapefius; fome areflexores, fome extenforesy fome rotatores, fome
fupinatores. A s to its being a fimilar part, it is only faid to be fo according to fenfe
or appearance; and that it is fuch, it appears, forafmuch as it forms not o f itfelf
alone the moft fimple organical part, as a finger or toe, & c . but they take into
their compofition, with a mufcle, feveral other fimilar parts, as bones, cartilages,
membranes, skin, & c, Moreover a truly diftimilar or organical tart is only found
in itfelf, not in other parts: but a mufcle, as it is but a part o f all diftimilar parts,
fo it goes univerfally or every where to theconfticution o f all organical parts, which
even the moft fimple organical parts do not.
T he mufcles o f the head are either proper, from which comes the primary mo­
tion upon the firft vertebra, to which it is immediately and clofely joined, being
bent forward and backward, or turned round; and they are in number eighteen
fingle, or nine pair: or common, which are thofe, which together with the head
move the neck, and thefe are the mufcles of the neck, o f which in their proper place.
The firft pair is called fplenius or fplenicus, or triangularis; it proceeds from the
firft vertebra o f the breaft, is fpread out on each fide upon the vertebra, reaching to
the third vertebra o f the neck, from whence it is carried to the middle o f the occi­
put ; its ufe is to draw the head directly backwards: but, if only one o f the mufcles
act, the motion is circular to one fide. T he fecond pair is called complexus or tri­
geminus: it is a la ge mufcle aflifting the other. It has divers beginnings at the
feventh vertebra of the neck, and at the firft, third, and fourth, o f the breaft, and is
after a different manner terminated in the occiput. The third pair is called fub
fecundoy and inferted into the hindermoft root o f the proceflus man.millaris: its ufe is
lightly to bring the head backwards; or backwards to one fide, if but one muf-
C U L P E P E R ss E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 43
cle acTcs. The fourth pair, called refit majorcs, are fmall, flelhy, and lean, and fpring
from the edge of the fecond fpondil or vertebra o f the neck, ending in the middle of
the occiput. The fifth pair, called refit minores, lie concealed under the former,
proceeding from the back part of the firft fpondil, or vertebra o f the neck, and is
inferred into the occiputs its ufe is the fame with the third and fourth pair. The
fixth pair is called obliqui mqjores *
, it lies beneath and fprings from the procefs of the
firft vertebra, and ends in the occiput, by the outfide of the refit. T h e ievench pair
is called obliqui minores, it arifes from the fecond vertebra o f the neck, is inferted
into the tranfverfe procefs o f the firft vertebra, and terminates in the occiput the ufe
of thefe two oblique pair is to bring the head about to the fides. T he eighth pair,
called mafioides, is placed in the forepart; they arife for the moft part double, long,
and round, in the forepart o f the neck, from the upper part of thefterntmt or breail-
bone, and midft of the clavicula, and is obliquely inferted into the mammillary
procefs, which it embraces; its ufe is to turn the head. The ninth pair, called
fallopiant, lies under the throat in the forepart of the neck, and near the firft pair o f
the neck; it arifes nervous from the ligaments of tht vertebra of the neck, and is
inferted into the bafis of the head, which it turns in like manner as the former.
T he mufcles o f the forehead have choir original from the upper parts of the fore­
head and skull, near the coronal future, and, being fpread out upon the bone there­
of, they end at the eye-brows, that they might lift them up, being fevered in the
midft o f the forehead, right above the nofe; but knit at the fides to the temporal
mufcles.
T he mufcles of the occiput, or hind part o f the head, are rather membranes, which
draw backwards the skin o f the head, in fuch perfons as have the skin moveable.
T he two eye-lids are moved by four mufcles: the firft is the frontalis, which is
ftraight, belonging to the upper eye-lid, to lift up the brow. T h e fecond is the
mujeuhis ciliarisprimus, which compares about each o f the eye-lids. T h e third is the
mufculus ciliarisfccundas, which is drawn out under the eye-lids, and arifing from the
circumference o f the orbita9 or focket o f the eye; the ufe of thefe ciliaris is to Ihut
the eye-lids. The fourth is orbicularismajor; it is o f a finger's breadth, encompaftes
the furface of the orbita, or focket, and being placed under each eye-lid, and reach­
ing as far as the eye-brow, it clofely fhucs the eye-lids, by lifting up the lower, and
drawing down the eye-brow.
The eye hath fix mufcles, o f which four are ftrait, and two oblique or circu­
lar ; they are all feated within the cavity o f the skull, and accompany the optic
nerve. The firft mufcle is called attolkns or fuperbus; it is the upper and thicker,
and is the lifter up of the eye, being the proud or fcornful mufcle. T h e fecond is
called
44
called deprimens (the deprefler) and mifeulus bumilis; it is placed oppofite to the
ocher, and draws the eyes downwards towards the cheeks. T h e third is called ad-
dtianSy the drawer t o ; alio letloriusythe reading rnufcle, becaufe it moves the eye in­
wards towards the nofe. T h e fourth is called abducens, the drawer from , becaufe it
draws the eye to the outward corner; it is alfo termed the indignatoriusyas being the
m ufile o f indignation. A ll thefe four mufcles have the fame original, progrcfs, and
en d; the beginning o f them all is acute, near the hole where the optic nerve enters
into the locket of the eye, from the membrane whereofthey arife; their belly is fleftiy
and round, and their end a very fmall tendon*: by all thefe four atting together, the
eye is kept from ftirring. T h e fifth rnufcle, called obiiquus major, or fuperior,
arifes from a common beginning with the firft four, is carried right out to the inner
corner o f the eye, where it pafies out and afcends in a right angle to the upper fide
o f the cornea: this rnufcle is the fmalleft o f all, and has the longeft: tendon, by
which it wheels the eye about unto the inner corner. The fixth rnufcle, called obli-
quus interim minor and inferior, is a lhort, lean, round, anc oblique, rnufcle, feated
between the eyes and tendons o f the fecond and third rnufcle; it fprings from the
lower and almoft outward part o f the orbit o f the eye, and, afcending by the out­
ward corner to the upper part o f the e>c, is inferred into the cornea by the region o f
the iris. It whirls about the eye obliquely downwards to its external or outward
corner.
T h e mufcles o f the external part o f the ear are four pair; o f the internal part,
two pair; but in mod people the ears are immoveable, becaufe o f the fmallnefs of
the mufcles and little need o f rheir motion. O f the four firft mufcles, three are
common with other parts; the fourth is proper to itfelf. T h e firft m ufde is called
deprimenSy common to the ear and each lip, and is a part o f the firft: rnufcle which
moves the cheeks and fkin o f the face, and is called qnadratusy the fquare mulcle,
very thin and broad, and is implanted into the root o f the ear, and pulls it down.
T h e fecond is called antrorfum dmens, or the drawer forwards ; it is a part o f the
frontal rnufcle, which is carried above the temporal rnufcle, and is inierted into the
upper part o f the ear. T h e third rnufcle is called retrorfum ducens, or abducens ad
pojUr:oraythe drawer back, and arifes from a part o f the occipital rnufcle, above the
procc/jiis mmimillariSy with a narrow beginning, from whence, growing broader, it is
carried downwards tranfverfelv, and inferted into the hinder part o f the ear. T h e
fourth irufcle is called triparitus, or aUoknsythe lifter u p ; it arifes from theprocejfus
raam
m
illariSy and being broad it grows narrow by little and l;ttle, till at laft it ends
in a tendon, and is inferted into the root o f the ear. This is the only proper rnufcle
to the ear, and is rather three-fold, becaufe it has three infertions, though all fpring
from
C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 43
from one place. T he fifth mufcle which belongs to the internal part o f the ear is
called exterms: it is very fmall, fpringing from the skin and membrane which cover
the paflage c f the ear* then, becoming flefhy, it pafieth by a Ihort tendon to the out­
ward part of the tympanum, and is inl'erted about the center of it. T h e fixih mufcle
which belongs to the internal part o f the ear is called internus: it is fmall, and placed
within the cspetrofum, with a double tendon, one part o f which is fixed to the higher
procefs o f the malleolus or hammer, the other to its neck. It arifes from the bafts o f
the wedge-like bone, then becomes fomewhat flelhy, afterwards narrower, and ends
in a double tendon. Its ufe is to draw the head o f the hammer obliquely inward.
T h e nofe has eight mufcles, or four pair, efpecially in large-nofed people, but they
are fmall, fcecaufe the motion o f the nofe is little. T he firft pair are called openers
orwideners: they are ficlhy, arife from the cheek-bone near the mufcle o f the lips
and Tides of the nofe •
, they are inferted partly into a part of the upper lip, partly
into the lower wing, and end in the top o f the nofe. T h e fecond pair is called
ereSlores or aperientes, openers: they are moftly triangular, and with a (harp and flefhy
beginning fpring from the future o f the forehead by the foramen laehrymak, under
the tear glandule, and, cleaving to the bone, are outwardly inferred and carried to the
pinna, wings, or Tides o f the nofe. T he third pair are called eonftringentes, or pulling
together: they are little, arife flefhy about the roots o f the pinna, are carried along
tranfverfely, and inferted into the corners o f the w ings: their ufe is a little to flute
the noftrils, T he fourth pair are called deprimentes: thefe are exceeding firm, and
membranous, lie hid under the coat o f the noftrils in the inner part: they arife from
the extremity of the os naft, and are implanted into the pinna or wings ■, their ufe is
to deprefs the nofe, or pull it downwards.
T h e mufcles common to both cheeks and lips are, i. zigomatieus or quadratus
detrahens - it is a thin mufcle like a membrane, interlaced with flefhy fibres. It
arifes from the vertebra o f the neck, in the outward fide, and afeending up by the
oblique fibres to the face is implanted in the chin, and terminated in the meeting o f
the two lips: this pair draws the lips backwards. 2. Buccinator, the trumpeter,
or cheek driver or mover : this pair lieth under the former in the upper part o f i t ;
and makes up all that part o f the cheek which is blown up when a trumpet is
founded. It ariles from the top o f the gums near the fartheft grinders, and ends
in each lip. T h e mufcles proper to the lips are either proper to each lip or
common to both. T h e upper lip has two pair o f mufcles proper to i t ; the lower
has but one. T he firft pair is attolens or furfum trahens, which draws the
lip upwards: it fprings from the corner between the eyes and the nofe, and is
inferted into the fubftance o f the upper lip. T he fecond pair, called deorfum movens,
29. jV" arifes
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N .
46
arifes from the upper jaw-bone, ju ft in the cavity o f the cheeks, under the focket
o f the eye, thin, but broad and flefhy. T h e third pair, called deorfum trahens,
proper to the lower lip only, arifes from the middle o f the chin, with a broad begin­
ning, and afccncis dire&ly to the middle o f the lower lip, which it moves upwards.
T h e mufcles alfp common or belonging to both lips are alfo three pair, firft,
chlique furfutr. trahens, that which obliquely draws upwards. T h e fecond pair
common is obliquedeorfumtrahens, or deprimens, moving the lips obliquely downwards.
T h e third common to both lips is circular, encompafiing and conftituting the whole
mouth, making the proper fubftance o f the lip s: by help whereof, the mouth is
purfed up, or drawn together.
T h e mufcles o f the lower jaw are in number twelve, viz. fix pair, being fix on
either fide. 1. temporalis, crotapbites, the temporal mufcle, fo called from its fix a ­
tion, becaufe it poflefles the cavities o f the tem ples: it is the greateft o f all thejaw -
mufcles, being very firm and ftrong; it runs along under the oszigoma, and is by a very
ftrong and nervous tendon inferred into the fharp procefs o f the jaw-bone. Jts ufe
is forcibly to pull up the lower jaw , and to fhuc the mouth. 2. Majfeter, the chew­
ing mufcle, or firft chew er: it is placed in the cheeks, and arifes from adouble head.
It is infertec into the inferior jaw-bone, by a very broad and ftrong connection.
3. Alare externum, the outward wing mufcle. It arifes from the osfpbamides and the
external proeeffus alaris, with a beginning partly nervous and partly flcfhy, and is
inferted into the neck o f the lower jaw-bone, and in the inner feat o f the head. Its
ufe is to move forwards and thruft out. 4. Majfeter internut, the other chewer, is
thick and fhorr, and is implanted into the inner and hinder part o f the jaw , with a
broad and ftrong tendon. Its ufe is to afljft the temporal mufcle. 5. Mufculus latus,
the double-bellied mufcle, or broad mufcle. It is nervous in the middle, and flefhy
at the ends, and is inferted into the chin, under the bending o f the jaw , faftened to
a ligament, left it fhould go too far back. Its ufe is to draw the jaw downwards to
open the meuth. 6. Mufculus latus, the broad or broadeft mufcle. It arifes from
the upper part of the Jlcrnum, the clavicula, and fiioukier-point, and, covering the
whole neck and face, it cleaves firmly to the inferior jaw , and is fixed in the middle
o f the chin. T h e four laft mufcles draw the jaw upwards, and are exceeding ftrong j
the laft two only draw it downwards, becaufe it would be apt to deprefs itfelf.
T h e mufcles o f the os byoides or tongue-bone, which is the foundation o f the
tongue, are in number four pair. 1. Sterno-byoides: it arifes from the inner but up­
per part o f thefternum, and retting upon the windpipe lies concealed in the forepart
under the fkin. 2. Genio-byoides, which arifes from the inner part o f the chin, flcfhy,
broad,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 47
broad, fhort, and is inferred into the middle or hollow o f the os hyoides. 3. Stylo-
cerato-byoides.* it arifes from the root o f the prccejjubfiyloidcs, being lean, round, and
feated under the chin. 4. Ceraca hyoides •
• it arifes at the firft, fmall, lean, and long,
from the upper fide of thefeapula, becomes flefhy about the neck,and, paffing under
the levator of the fhoulder-blade, is inferred into the point o f the hyoides. T h is pair
is long, and has two bellies, being extenuated in the middle like a tendon.
T he mufcles m oving the tongue are in number five p air: 1. jlylogloffum, arifing
from the outfide o f thz appendixJlyloides, and ending with tranfverfe fibres, in both
fides o f the tongue; it moves the tongue inwards *
, and, by reafon o f the interwoven
fibres, they lift the tongue upwards, if they aft both together; or upwards only on
one fide, if only one afts. 2. Myloglojfum, arifing from the Tides o f the lower jaw ,
at the roots c f the grinding teeth, and ending under the bafis o f the tongue in the
ligam ent: when both aft, they move the tongue to the pallet and upper teeth;
but when one afts the tongue is moved obliquely upwards. 3. Gemoglojjiim, arifing
inwardly from the middle o f the chin, and terminating almoft in the middle o f the
tongue inwardly : its ufe is to thruft the tongue out o f the mouth, and alfo to draw
it in again, fothat it feems to perform contrary aftions. 4. IJypftlogloffum, arifing
flefliy out o f the upper and middle region o f the os byoides, runs along according to
the length of the tongue; and is terminated into the middle o f it: this pair draws
the tongue inward. 5. Ceratogloffum, which arifes from the upper horns o f the by-
tides, and is obliquely inferted into the fides o f the tongue, near the root thereof. It
moves the tongue downward toward the inward parts, when both aft ; but to the
right or left fide, if only one he contracted.
The mufcles o f the larynx, or windpipe, are either common or proper; the com­
mon are two pair, fternothyroides and byothyroides. 1. S ternotbyroidei arifes from the
inner fide of thefternum, runs along by the larynx, and is inferted beneath into the
fides of the feutiformis, or fhield-faftened griltle. T h is ftraightens the chink o f the
larynx, by drawing down thefeutiformis. Hyotbyroides, arifes from the lower fide o f
the os byroides, being broad and flefhy, and touches the feutiformis, and is inferted
into its bafis. It widens the chink, by lifting up the feutifomis. Thefe common
mufcles are implanted into the larynx, but do not arife therefrom. T he proper
mufcles are five pair; t. tbyrocricoides arifes from the lowed part o f the feutiformis,
and ends at the annularis, and is inferted into the lateral parts o f the thyreides. 2.
Cricotkyroides rifes from the hinder fides o f the annularis, flefhy; and is inferted into
the lower part of the glottalis, with a nervous end, opening the larynx by drawing
afunder the two griftles called arytenoides. 3. Crycoarytbenoides laterale, fprings above
from the fide of the annularis, and is implanted at the fides of the glottalis, into the
joint,
joint, and opens the larynx with the fame oblique motion of the griftlcs. 4. Tbyroa>y~
tanoidesy oxglottoides; this helps the former, and, fpringing from the inner and
fore part of the thyroides, is terminated into the lateral part or fides o f theglottalis, or
eirytenoidtSy which fliuta the larynx by a ftraight pafTage; if this pair is inflamed in a
quinfey, it is mortal, becaufe it exactly fhuts the chink. 5. Arytenoides is a round
mufcle, co.npafiing the ewer-like cartilage: it arifes from the hinder line o f the
guttalis, and, being carried along with tranfverfe fibres, is inferted into the fides
thereof.
T h e uvula has two pair o f mufcles, two on either fide, viz. an external and inter­
nal pair. 1. Ptery-Jlaphylinus externus riles from the upper jaw , and under the laft
grinding tooth, ends in afm all tendon, which pafles through a chink on the upper
fide of the pterygoides. 2. PtcryfiaptylmismUrnus proceedsfrom the lower part o f the
internal wing o f thepterygoides, andafcendingaccording to thelongitude o f the wing
is inferted in like manner into the uvula.
The pharynx or throat, which is the beginning o f the cef&phagus or gullet, has fe-
ven mufcles belonging to it, viz. three pair, and one without a fellow. i. Spba-
nopbaryngaus, which Ipringsfrom thefliurpjjointof thefphamides%
and,palling down­
wards, is inferted into the lateral parts o f the pharynx, or throat, to pull up the
mouth o f cheftomach, that it may receive the meat. 2. ChtphakpharyngauSy which
fpring from the part where the head is joined to the neck, and, running down, is
1pread about the pharynx or cefophagus, Teeming to make the membrane o f it. 3. Sty-
hpharyn%ysuty which fprings from theflyloidesprocefSy and is inferted into the fides o f
the pharynx^ both to dilate and amplify it. 4.Oefopbagus. T h e mufcle without a
fellow, being only a fphinfter-like mufcle, encompaffing the gullet. It fprings from
one fide o f the tbyroidesy and circularly encompaffing the hinder part o f the pharynx
is tied to both tire fides o f the tbyroidesy to contract the mouth o f the ftomach as
thefpbinfler doth the anus.
T h e mufcles o f the neck are four pair. T h e two firft pair, to wit, mufculus longus
and mufculusfealenusy bend the neck > the two latter pair, viz. mufculus tranfverfalis
and mufculusfpinatuSy extend it. 1. Longus lies under the afopbagus or gullet, fprings
from the fifth vertebra o f the breaft, with a beginning flefhy and fharp, afeends la­
terally, annexed to all the bodies o f the vertebra, terminating in the extuberant pro-
cel's o f thevertebr*y with an acute tendon, and fometimes is inferted into the occiputy
near itsgreac hole. 2. Scalenus arifes flefhy, atthe fide o f the neck, from the firft rib,
and is inferted inwardly, by oblique fibres, into all the tranfverfe proceftes o f the
vertebra of the n eck ; through this pair, the veins and arteries enter into the arm.
3. TranfverfaltSy arifing from the tranfverfe eminences or procefies o f the fix upper-

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 49
mod vertebra o f the bread, and is inferred into all the external tranfverfe eminences
o f the neck. 4. Spinatus, arifing from the roots o f the feven uppermoft vertebra o f the
bread, five of the neck, and is inferted into the fpine or point o f the fecond vertebra
o f the neck.
T h e mufcles o f the bread or thorax are in number fixteen, viz. eight on either fide,
o f which the fird five widen or lift up the bread: the lad three contract it *
, to thefe
add,as a ninth, one peculiar muffle, called diapbragina or the midriff, t. Subclavius,
it arifes from the inner part o f the clavicula, is of a fleflhy fubfhnce, and is drawn up­
wards and outwards, and inferted into the upper part o f the fird rib. 2. Serratus
major, the greater faw-like mufcle, it reaches from the inner bafis o f the fcapula
unto fix and fometimes feven o f the ribs. 3. Serratus pcfticus fuperior, which grows
out of the fharp points or fpines o f the three lower vertebra o f the neck, and the fird
o f the back, and is inferted into the three upper ribs, and fometimes into the fourth.
4. Mufculi intircojlalesexterni, thefe are eleven pair in number, but perform the office
o f one mufcle only ; are interwoven, totally flefhy, and arife from the lower parts
o f the upper ribs, and, defeending obliquely towards the back parts, are inferted
into the upper parts o f the lower ribs, terminating on the cartilages. 5. Triangula­
ris, it is fmall and thin in lean perfons, fprings out o f the inner and lower part o f the
jlernum, and is inferted into the cartilages o f the lower ribs, as far as the third or
fourth of the badard ribs. 6. Sacrohmbus, which fprings from the osfaerum, and the
fpinous process o f the loins, and is inferted into the upper ribs near their roots,
beftowing upon each rib a double tendon, one external, the o:her internal. 7. Ser­
ratus pofticus inferior, it is oppofite to the fuperior; and both of them, by a broad
and membranous tendon, fo grow together, that they ferve inftead o f a band to
keep the hinder mufcle o f the back-bone together: it grows out o f the fpines or
precedes o f the three lowed vertebra o f the back, and fird o f the loins, is terminated
in three or four o f the lower ribs. 8. Mufculi intercofiales intern, thefe are the fame
in number and place with the externi, and lie dire&ly under them ♦, they are carried
obliquely from the nether rib to the uppermod, arid have fiores contrary to thofe
o f the external, crodwife interfered. 9. D'tapbragma or midriff, called alfo precor-
dia., becaufe it is dretched out before the heart \ and phrenes, becaufe, being affefted,
the mind and fenfes are didurbed, by reafon o f the content it has with the brain: fo
that, when the midriff is inflamed, a phrenzy is caufed. It is one in number, an in-
ftrument o f free motion, and an admirable kind of mufcle, both in regard o f its
compofition and continual a&ion or motion, ferving alfo as a wall o f partition to
fever the vital and natural parts one from another. T he head o f it is in the nervous
center, but the tail in the circumference o f the lower fhort ribs, from whence it
29. O nrifes,
5°
ai ifes, and through which it is obliquely drawn about, as far as to the vertebra o f the
loins. Ic has a double membrane tor ftrength fake, the upper is from the pleura,
to which fhepericardium is firmly fattened, and fometimes a)lb the lobes o f the lungs j
the lower is from the peritonaum.
T h e mufcles o f the back and loins are four p air; the full pair is quadratum, ad­
hering to the tranfverfe procefles o f the vertebra o f the loirs, ariling inwardly from
the os ilium and os facrum, broad and flefhy. Its ufe is to bend the vertebra o f the
loins. 2. Longifftmumy arifes with an acute and ftrong tendon from the extremity o f
the os f(urumy the vertebra o f the loins, and os ilii, having the fame beginning with
thefacrobmbus ♦, to the vertebra o f the back ic gives tendons like clafps, terminating
fometimes in the firft vertebra o f the breaft, and fometimes at the mammillaryprocejfes.
3. Sacrum arifes from thtosfacrum behind, being flefhy, and terminates in the twelfth
vertebra o f the breaft. 4. Semifpinatum, which arifes where the former ends, and em­
bracing all the fpines o f the vertebra o f the breaft, and giving them tendons, it ter­
minates in the fpine o f the firft vertebra o f the breaft. T he ufes o f thefe three laft
are to extend the breaft, loins, and their vertebra: if all the eight mufcles act, they
hold the back ftraighr, and as it were uphold a man.
T h e mufcles o f the abdomen or belly cover the lower belly, and have their names
partly from their fituation and rife, and partly from their figure. T hey are in
number ten, or five pair, whofe principal ufes are to impel the internal parts, and
to move the os facrum and ilium: or to make a proper retention and compreflion o f
the parts in the belly: to provoke voiding the excrements, or help the expulfive fa­
culty of the womb and bladder. Their temperament is hot and moift, to cherifh
natural heat and concottion: they are moderately thick, to defend the parts, and,
when very flefhy, they add much to the comelinefs o f the body. T h e firft pair is
cbliquus defenders^ fo called by reafon of its fibres, which defeend obliquely. It
rifes in the breaft from the lower part o f the fixth, feventh, and eighth, ribs, and
terminates in the white line by a broad tendon. 2. Obliquus afeendens is fituated
next the former, in a triangular figure, rifing flefhy from the rib o f the os ilii9 but
membranous from the fharp procefles o f the vertebra of the loins, and from the
fharp points of the os facrum: it afeends obliquely, and terminates in a double
tendon embracing the mufculus reflus like a fheath; but the duplicity appears only
above the navel, for below it it is united infeparably. 3. Mufculus reftus \ its ori­
ginal is flefhy, from thefermm9on each fide the fword-like cartilage, and from the
cartilages o f the four baftard rib s: it has three nervous infertions which ftrength-
en it \ anc veins which run along the longitude o f it, viz. the mammaria defenden-
tes from the breafts, and the epigajlrica afendentes from the womb in women, but
from

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y , 5*
from the vena cava in men; which meet about the middle o f this mufcle, extend­
ing as tar as iheregion o f the navel, and are there terminated. Thefe two veins are
joined by amftomafis, from whence the con fent o f the womb with the breads is
cauied; which, being handled, excites women to venery.4. Mufculipyratudales, the
pyramidal mufcles, lie upon the extremities o f the mufculi refii, and rife with a flefhy
beginning from the external (hare bone, where all the nerves enter* and, growing
narrower by degrees, they terminate with a (harp point in the tendon o f the tranf-
verfe mufcle. Their office is to comprefs the bladder, and therefore they fend their
tendons, between the mufculi refity into that part o f the peritoneum which includes
the bladder. 5. Mufculi tranfverfiy the crofs mufcle, arifing from a certain ligamenc
whichfprings out o f the w facrum\ and, terminating by a broad membranous ten­
don in the lineaalba, (lick extremely fall to the peritoneumevery where except about
thepubis. Its proper ufe is to comprefs the colon.
T h e mufcles o f the os ilium and facrum are moved forward in coition by the mufcu­
li refit and obiiqutdefceudenlcs o f the belly, the bread reding and the thigh remaining
unmoved. They are moved backwards by the mufculusfacer and femifpinatusywhich,
arife from thevertebra o f the back, & c.
T h e mufcles o f the penis or yard are two pair; the fird pair is called erefiory or
direfior*
, the latter, accelerator. 1. Erefior, or patent erigensyis a Ihort and thick pair,
arifingnervous under the beginning o f the yard, from the innermoft bunching out
o f the ifebium, and, being knit unto the ligament o f the yard, growing fldhy, it
reaches fide-ways as far as the middle o f the body thereof: iheir ufes are to eredt
and keep up the yard in coition. 2. Mufculi accekratores, or par uretbram dilatans,
are longer than the former, but thinner or leaner * they arife both from thefpbinfier
o f the anus and internal tuberofity o f the ifebium or huckle-bone, are fpread out
under the ureibraycarried beneath, and inferced into the Tides thereof, about its mid­
dle: its ufe is to dilate or widen the urethra both for the palTage o f the urine and
for the feed in coition. Thefe are the mufcles where an appertion is commonly
made in cutting for the done.
T he mufcles o f the clitoris, proper to female fubje&s, are like thofe in a man’s
yard, the fame innumber, and to the fame intent. T he two uppermoft being round,
rife from the internal knob o f the ifcb'mmyand, being placed by the lateral ligaments,
caufe the erection o f it. T h e two lower are broad and fmooth, and proceed from
thefpbinfier of the anus.
T h em u fck so f »he tefticles are either proper or common. T h e proper mufcles
are only the pair called eremajler, arifing from a ftrong ligament in the os pubis,
where the tranfverfe mufcles o f the belly end, o f which they feem to be parts j they
pafs
pais through the production o f the peritoneum which they compafs nearly about, and
pafs with the fpermatic vcfiels to the ftones» they are fhorter in women than in men,
and are placed above the production o f the peritoneum: their ufe is to fuftain or hold
up the ftones. T he common mufcle is the membrane o f the ferotum called dartos9
being a continuation o f the flelhy membrane * and this mufculous membrane fuf-
pends both tefticles.
T h e bladder has but one mufcle, called fpbinfter, which encompaficth the neck of
the bladder, in an orbicular form, as alfo are the fibres. It is flefhy, drawn back
over thtproftat* or auxiliary tefticles; it ejaculates the feed in coition. In women
it reaches to the hole by which the urine pafles, and it feems to form it.
T h e mufcles o f the anus, or fundament, are either the fpbincler or the levatores;
the fpbinfler mufcle, called ant confiriftor, the ftiutter or contractor, is fleftiy, (and
without the ftraighc gut two inches broad;) arifes from the lower vertebra o f the
osfacrum; and is encompafied with the tranfverfe fibres all along the anus: it is faft-
cned on the fore part to the paflage o f the bladder by fibrous couplings, to the yard,
to whole mufcles it gives beginning j and to the neck o f the w om b: on the hinder
part it is inferted into the coccyx or crupper-bone, and at the fides it is faftened into
the os coxa* T h e tnufeuli levatoresare four, or two pair; one pair o f which are broad,
and one narrow. Mufculi levatores lali, arife from the osfacrum and os ilium, and are
inferted into the largerfpbinfier. Mufculi levatorestenues,the narrow m ufcles: o f which
the fofemoft arifes from the tranfverfe ligam ent; the hindermoft from the coccyx,
whereunto they are terminated;
T h e mufcles o f the fhoulder-blade, or fcapula, are four, according to the number
o f its motions, viz. forward and backward, upward and downward : \.ferratusminor,
the fmaller Taw-like mufcle, arifing from the four upper ribs, and afeending ob­
liquely upwards, with an end partly flelhy, partly tendinous, and is inferted into the
fcapula; its ufe is to draw forwards into the breaft: 2. trapezius, cticulares, arifes flelhy
from the hinder part o f the head towards the ear, from whence it defeends to the
eighth vertebra o f the breaft, and, from thence growing fmall by degrees, it is inferted
into the back-bone, top o f the (houlder, and clavicula ♦, it moves thefcapula varioufly,
according to its oblique fibres: 3. rbombo'tdes, or diamond-like mufcles, fituate under
the cucularis, thin and broad, arife from the three lower vertebra o f the neck and the
three upper vertebra o f the breaft, and in the fame breadth are inferted into the ex­
ternal bafis of thefcapula; it draws back a little obliquely upwards: 4. levator muf
cuius patientia, arifes from the tranfverfe apophyfes o f the fecond, third, and fourth,
vertebra of the neck, and is inferted into the higher and lower corners o f thefcapula;
its ufe is to lift the fhoulder up.

The arm is varioufly moved, therefore has it many mufcles, to wit, nine in num­
ber. i. Peftoralis is great and flefhy, arifing from the whole breaft-bone, and griftle
thereof, the jlermim, and above half the davicula, and is by a {harp tendon inferted
into-the fhoulder-bone, between the deltoides and the bicep:. 2. Deltoides, from
fikenefs to the letter a, fprings from the middle o f the clavicula, and the aerominm,
and is inferted into the middle o f the arm or ihoulder-bone. 3. Latijfwius, fprings
from the vertebra o f the loins, and o f nine vertebra o f the back, and is inferted
into a part of the arm, between the pe&oral and round mufcle, with a ftrong,
fhort, and broad, tendon: this with its fellow o f the other arm covers almoft the
whole b ack: it is called antfcalptor, becaufe it draws the arm backwards and down­
wards. 4. Rotundasmajor is flefhy, thicker, and rounder, than the reft, obliquely
feated behind under the axilla, and arifes from the lower rib o f the fcapula, which,
afcending a little with its tendon, fhort, broad, and ftrong, is inferted (with the
pettoral mufcle) into the middle o f the arm. 5. Rotundas minor, is ftiort, round,
quite flefhy, and arifes with a ftiarp beginning out o f the lower corner o f thefcapula,
terminating with an acute end in that ligamentrwith which the head o f the fhoulder
is involved. 6. Infra fpinatus, arifes in the middle between the fmaller round mufcle
and the-fpina, covers the whole external bunching part o f thefcapulay then, becom­
ing more narrow, it is inferted into the neck o f the arm, or fhoulder. 7. Supra•
Jpinatus, is flefhy, and arifes out o f the fpine o f the upper rib o f thefcapula, then,
being conveyed under the acrmium, it is inferted- with a broad and ftrong tendon
into the neck o f the arm, at the ligament o f thejoint. 8. Subfcapularis, or iimnerfus,
is very flefhy, and paflcs between the fcapula and ribs, poflefling the hollow and
inward part of the Ihoulder-blade, then is carried out, and inferted, with a broad
tendon, internally into the fecond ligament o f the humerus. Coracoides, is inferted
into the inner part o f the fhoulder, about the middle o f the arm, by the tendon o f
the deltoides. Its beginning is nervous and fhort: and its belly has an hole in
it (whence its name) to give a paflagc to the nerves running to the mufclcs o f the
cubit.
T he cubit or elbow has two bones, the ulna and radius * the ulnaferves for flexion
and extenfioo 5 but the radius for pronation and fupination. T h e ulna is bended
by two mufcles, the biceps and bracbieus intemus, and extended by four, viz. longus*
brevis, cubitalis, and bracbiaus extemus. 1. Biceps, arifes from thefcapula, round and
tendinous, which is inferted into the inner part o f the radius. 2. Bracbieus intemus
is placed beneath the biceps, fmaller than the former, and arifing from the middle
o f the osbracbii, and is inferted before into the common beginning o f the radius and
ulna. 3. Lotgus, or extendemprimus, arifes from the lower rib of'the fhoulder-blade,
30. P near
*4
neartheneck, with a double beginning, and is terminated in the elbow. 4. Brevis
extwdemfeamdus, fprings from the hinder neck o f the arm, mixed with the forego-
ing mufcle, clothes the humeri, and terminates on the ouefide o f the elbow. 5. An-
coneus extendois tertius, it is fituate in the bending of the cubit, on the hinder fide ; it
arifes out o f the lower and hinder part o f the arm, between the ulna and radius, and
is inferred by a nervous tendon into the fide o f the cubit. 6. Brachietts externus,
being fpread out upon the outfide o f the brachium : it is a flefhy lump, made o f the
two former, and is placed under them, being inferted into the fame place.
T h e radius has four mufcles, two o f which are pronatores or pullers down; and
two J'upinatores or pullers up. 1. Pronator fuperior arifes from the inner apophyfis
o f the arm, by a ftrong and flefhy beginning, and ends with a membranous tendon,
obliquely running into the middle o f the radius. 2. Pronator inferior, from the
lower part of the cubic ulna, unto the lower part o f the radius, and is there inferted.
3. Supinator longior, from the top o f the brachium, above the external knob, and,
being drawn out upon the radius, is inferted on the infide o f the lower epiphyfis
thereof. 4. Supinator brevior, fprings from the outward apophyfis o f the arm, flefhy
within, membranous without, and is inferted nearly into the middle o f the radius.
T o the wrift belong four mufcles, o f which the firft two bend it and the latter
two extend it. 1. Cubiteus internusythe firft bender, arifes from the internal apophy­
fis o f the arm, and, being ftretched over the elbow, is inferted with a thick tendon
into the fourth bone o f the wrift. 2. Radieus interims, the fecond bender, is drawn
along the radius, arifes from the beginning with the former, and terminates in th ej
firft bone of the metacarpium, under the fore-finger. 3. Radieus externus^ arifes
with a broad beginning, from the external apophyfis o f the arm, and terminates in
a double tendon at the firft and fecond bones o f the os metacarpi. 4. Cubiteus exter-
wkj, arifes from the fame beginning, through the length o f the cu b it; when it comes
to the wrift, it becomes a ftrong, round, tendon, and is inferted into the upper part
o f the fourth bone of the metacordus, under the little finger.
In the palm or hollow o f the hand are two mufcles, called palmaresy o f which the
one is long, the other fhort. 1. Palmaris longus, arifes from the inward apophyfis
o f the arm, with a round and tendinous beginning, is fpread into the hollow o f the
hand, cleaving exceeding faft to the fkin, where under the fkin, in the hollow o f
the palm, is a broad tendon, giving exqoifite fenfe to that part *
, it is terminated into
the firft intervals between the joints o f the fingers. 2. Palmaris brevis^ is a certain

The
T h e foot, or inftep, has eight mufcles. i. Tibiaus anticus, it is fattened to the leg,
and arifes near the fibula, and, cleaving to the tibia all along, it degenerates into a
tendon, which beneath the ring-like ligament o f the foot is divided into two tendons.
2. Peroneus anticus, joined to the peroneus potticus,andhas its rife with two heads, one
from the middle and external part o f the perone or fmaller focile; the other from
the upper epiphyfis o f the fibula : thefe, being carried through the chink o f the ancle,
terminate in a double tendon, the fmaller o f which is carried into the bone o f the
little to e; the greater running obliquely under the foie o f thefoot. 3. Gemellus eater-
nus i this has two heads ; they both arife from under the ham, the one from the in.
ner, the other from the outward, parts o f the end o f the Ehigh*bone, and pafs down
the back part o f the leg, then become tendinous, and, being united, make one
ttrong, broad, and nervous, tendon, which is inferred into the heel. 4. Gemellus inter-
nus, this wi:h the other conftitutes the ancle, and lies under the former, o f a livid
colour 5 it arifes under the ham, by a ttrong nervous fubftance*, having patted the
middle o f the tibia, it becomes narrower and tendinous: it is inferred into the heel.
Thefe make the belly or calf o f the leg. 5. Soleus9it is a broad and thick mufcle
arifing from the upper and hindermore appendix o f the fibula, and is inferted by a
tendon into the heel. 6. TibUuspofiicus adducens pedem9it arifes from the upper pare

the bone fet before the great toe. 8. Plantaris covers the whole foie o f the fo o t; and,
fpringing from the outer part o f the thigh-bone under the ham, by a round and flelhy
beginning, patting within the leg, between the gemelli, it goes thence to the foie,
and is inferted into the five toes.
T he great toe has five mufcles. i. Primus, or flexorpollids9 arifes from the upper

A B O N E is a fimilar, fpermatic, part, cold and dry, endowed with hardnefs,
ftrength, and folidity, that it might give force to the body, fuftain it, and help its
motion. Its fubftance is naturally hard and (olid, covered with a membrane, called
periojlion, white, with fome rednefs; hollow in the middle, (except the ribs, See.)
i'mooth covered in its extremities with a cartilage, and moiftened with a fat humour,
called medulla, or marrow. Some bones are perfectly generated in the womb, as
thofe in the ear, being the fmalleft in the whole body; they are nouriftied by arterial
blood, as may appear in the bones o f young animals, whole marrow is yet bloody,
as alfo by blood contained in the marrow: but the pioximate and immediate nutri­
ment o f hollow bones, is the marrow; but o f bones not hollowed, thick blood lent
in through the pores. T h e proper matter therefore o f a bone is feed, which confifts
o f humours and fpirits. T h e efficient caufe is the vis offtfica, or an innate faculty,
airing by the afliftance o f heat.
T he bones arejoined together, either byjympbyjis, for firmnefs, and union; or by
arthrtfis, articulation or jointing. Natural union, or growing together, is when the
connection or joining of bones is without motion : and this is with, or without, a
medium. Syntpbyfis without a medium is three-fold, viz. by future, harmonic, and
gomphofis. Suture, a future, is the joining o f bones by indenture, as if the teeth o f
two faws were thruft one into another, a3 in the bones o f the cramum or skull. Har-
monia, is the joining o f bones by a fingle line, whether ftraight, oblique, or circular,
as in the bones o f the nofeand upper jaw , and io all epipbyfes in a manner are joined.
Contpbojis, or nailing, when one bone is fattened into another, as a nail in a port, fo
the teeth are fattened in thejaw bones.
T he whole ftru&ure o f the bones o f the head is called craniuM, the skull, becaufe
it is as it were an helm et; it is alfo called calva and calvaria: its fubttance is boney,
to fecure the brain; but, in new-born children, it is fofter than ordinary.
T he bones of the head are either proper or common; the proper are in number
fix: osfrontis; 2. 3. ojjafincipitis; 4. occipitis; 5. 6. ojja temporum, T he common
bones are only two in num ber: osfpbanoides, and os ethmoides. Osfrontis, the fore­
head bone, called alfo coronals, is bounded before by the coronal and firtt common
future, and in the fides by the temporal bones; it is but one in thofe o f ripe age,
but in children it is double, being divided by a future patting from the coronal to
30. R the
62
the nofe * it alfo has a two-fold table, an internal and an external: on each fide o f
this bone, above the eye-brows, there are large cavities, commonly two in number,
between the two tables, clothed fometimes with a green membrane, and containing
a foft, clammy, and marrowifh, fubftance? from whence two holes pafs into the
■ wide fpaces o f the noftrils j and another, which ends into the skull above thefeptum
o f the os ethmoides, to diftinguifhthe organs o f fmelling.
OffaftncipitiSy the bones o f the fore-part o f the head: thefe cover the moifteft part
o f the brain, are in ftiape four-fquare and unequal, and of a more rare or fpongy
fubftance than the other bones, whence the wounds o f xhtjtnciput are deadly: they
are joined before with the bones o f the forehead, with the coronal fu tu re; to the os
occipitis* by the lambdoide future > and to the ojfa temporum* by the fu tu re fquatnofc:
without they are fmooth, but within unequal, by reafon o f the prints which the
jugular veins o f the dura m ater leave behind them.
Os occiputs* the bone o f the hinder part o f the head, conftitutes almofl all the
hinder part of the skull •, and is in children three or four bones, but in grown per-
fons but one. Its form is that o f a fpherical triangle, and is joined to the crown-
bones by the future lambdoides. It is the thickeft and mof: compact o f all bones o f
the head, chiefly at the bafis o f the sk u ll; (becaufe there the noble ventricle is feat-
ed, and from thence the nerves arife as from a fountain*,) but at the edges it is the
thinned of all. It is fmooth without, but within it has many finuofities to receive
the mennings fafely. It has five holes, through the greateft whereof the fpinalis
medulla pafles to the back-bone. T h e fmaller ferve for the going forth o f the nerves,
and entrance o f veins and arteries. It has nine cavities, feven within and two with­
out : and two broad procefles at the bafis, covered with a griftle, which is more
eminent, and inferted into the cavities o f the firft vertebra for the motion o f the
Jiead as alfo another fmall procefs behind joined to the firft vertebra, Ojfa temporumy
the bones of the temple. T heir form is uneven, almoft circular, becaufe o f their
various fubftance, which is like rocks and craggy cliffs, for which caufe they are
alfo called ojfapetrofa* the ftoney or rocky bones. In their upper part they are atte­
nuated like a fcale, fo as to be tranfparent, and arejoined to the bones o f thefinciput
like feales \ before they arejoined to the firft bone o f the upper jaw , by its firft pro­
cefs : and to the os occipitis, by the baftard future: they have fix holes without, two
within: the firft external hole is large, viz. the auditory paffage, the other five are
fmall for veffcls to pafs through. They have two cavities, an outer, covered with
a griftle, which receives the lower jaw-bone j and an inner, which is rather long,
and common to the os occipitis. T h e auricularis is internal, with a long protuberan-
cy, wherein there is a three-fold cavity, viz. the drum, the labyrinth, and the cochlea.

T h e tympanum9or drtm9called alfopelvis, which contains the internal or inbred air,
and the four bones, called malleolus, incus,jlapes, and orbiculare■, as alfo a ligament,
twofenejlra, or windows, (which are little holes in the cavity,) and a water pafiage j
from this cavity goes a channel into the palate o f the m.mth. The labyrintbus> cal­
led alfo fodina, is a cavity full o f crooked and manifold turnings; the entrance
hereinto is the ovalfenefira, andjoins itlelf to the following cavity j it has four holes
bcfides the oval, and a fifth, which is tcrmined in the cochlea or third cavity. T h e
cochlea has three or four windings, (with a wreathed or fnail-like figure,) the wind­
ings mutually receiving one another: thofe that are thick o f hearing have only one
or two o f thefe windings; this cavity is cloathed with an exceeding thin and foft
membrane, and adorned with multitudes o f little veins, which turn themfelves about
the wreathings o f the cocb!ea> and by many branches creep into the fecret turnings o f
the labyrinth.
Osfpbtnoides, or the wedge-fafhioned bone, becaufe it is feated as a wedge in the
middle o f the bones o f the fk u ll; at the Tides it goes along with the os petrofum,
from whence it is feparated by a rough chink •, above it touches the firft, fourth,
and fixth, bones, o f the upper ja w ; below it touches the bones o f the palace o f
the mouth, and is placed under the brain, as a foundation, lo that it touches almoft
all the bones of the head and upperjaw : in children it is made o f four bones, but
in grown perfons it is but one. It is folid, and the thickelt o f all the bones o f the
head, where it makes the bafis o f the fkull. In the external table are two remarka­
ble apophyfesy near the Tides o f the holes o f the nole, formed like the wings o f a bat.
In the internal table are four little procefles, in ihape o f a Turkilh faddle, called
fellaTurciea, full o f little holes, whole ufes are to elaborate the in-breathed air, to
make fpirits, and to pafs out pituitousexcrements through the funnel, out o f the ven­
tricles o f the brain. It has fundry perforations, by which the optic and motory
nerves of the eye, and ocher nerves for the motion o f other parts, as alfo veins and
arteries for nourifhment, pafs.
Os ethmoides, the fponge or fieve-falhioned bone, having in it many holaf, (by
which fmells pafs to the brain,) efpecially in the inner fide o f it, where it joins the
head, and this part is properly called cribrofa: from this within the fkull arifes a
(harp apopbyjhy refembling a cock*s-comb, by which the ethmoides is divided into
two parts j from this procefs is oppofed another, without the noftrils, and diftin-
guifhing them, called the divider o f the noftrils, as alfofeptum najt. T h e chief ufc
o f the ethmoides is to alter the air drawn in with fmells, that the fpecies o f odours
may, with the air, be carried to the organs o f fmelling, which end in thefe holes;
and therefore in a coryza, this bone being obftru&cd, the fmelling is lo ft: alfo heie-
z by
6+
by the brain is purged, for phlegm is not only evacuated by theglandula pltuitaria
into the palate, but alfo by the os cribrofum into the noftrils.
T h e bones of the upper jaw are in number eleven, five on either fide, and one
without a fellow : firft pair, ojfazygomatica, the yoke-bones, is in a manner triangu­
lar, and confticutes thegreateft part o f the os zygomatis or jugale, and a great part
o f the orbita and outward angles o f the eye, on the lower fide. Second pair, os la-
thrymaUy is a round, little, and thin, bone, in the inner comer o f the eye: by this a
branch o f the fifth pair o f nerves o f the brain pals to the inner membrane o f the nofe.
T hird pair, osmaxillareythe cheek-bone, the greateft and thickeft o f them a ll; it
contains all the upper teeth, and makes up the holes of the nofe, and m oll o f thole
bones which belong to the upper part o f the face: it has Urge cavities on both
Tides very remarkable, both that it might be lets ponderous, and that it m ight con­
tain marrow to nourifh the bones and upper teeth. Fourth pair, os naft> the bone
that confticutes the external and prominent boney part o f the nofe » it is thin, hard,
folid, and quadrangular: thefe two bones are joined with a future; within they are
rough, that the griftles o f the nofe may be the better faftened. Fifth pair, ospalati>
feared at the end o f the palate, where the holes o f the noftrils go into the fauces or
throat; they are thin, folid, and broad, and conftitutethe hinder part o f the cavity
of the palate and noftrils. Sixth, vomer, the bone without a fellow, like a plough;
it is the innioft and middlemoft under the fphoenoides, and above the palate: it
holds up the bridge o f the nofe like a partition wall, to which it is joined by the fu­
ture, harmcnia. Six bones conftitute the orbit o f the eye, 1. the frontak, which
makes the upper vaulted part: 2. zygomaticum, that on the outfide, where the fmaller
corner is, and a portion o f the os fphoenoides: 3. another on the outfide, concurring
with the former part o f the os fphoenoides: 4. maxillare, and 5. lachrymal?^ which
conftitute the inner part: 6. the fcaley table o f the os ethmoides, which makes up the
lower fide, all united partly by common, partly by proper, futures.
In children, till about feven years o f age, the lower jaw confifts o f two bones,
which are joined together by Jynchondroofis\ butingrown perfonsit is but one. T h e
arched part o f this bone is the chin ; at each end o f the fhanks are two proceffes,
whereof one is fharp, called corone, going forward, into which the tendon o f the
temporal mufcle is implanted; the other articularis, becaufe it ferves for articula­
tion with the tempie bones, which articulation is covered with a common mem­
branous ligament. Its fubftance isexceeding hard and ftrong, that it may hold out
in biting and chew ing; within it, there is a long cavity, where marrow is contain­
ed to nourifh the teeth, and by which a branch o f our fifth pair o f nerves o f the
brain runs unto the roots o f the teeth with a little vein and artery: this cavity goes
quite through the jaw-bone like a pipe, fo that a copper wire, put in at one end,
will
C U L P E P E R * s E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N :
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y .
will come out at the other. It is movable, and contains fockets for the teeth; and
in old age, when the teeth fall our, the fockccs draw together, and become fliarp.
T he teeth are bones properly fo called, white, fmooth, hard, and folid, being
indeed harder than other bones, that they might bite and chew hard things, not
much inferior in hardnefs to (tones. They are naked, without any perioftion, yet
endowed with a kind o f fenfe, as may be perceived by cold drink, or when fee on
edge; which fenfe is lodged in the inner, foftcr, and more nervous, part. They
receive into their cavities nerves, which other bones do not, and by which they arc
tied to the mandible with a finncurofis. T h e teeth continually grow, all a man’s
life, becaufe they are daily worn by biting and grinding. T he cavities o f the teeth
are clothed with a little membrane o f exquilite fenfe, whence it is that pains o f the
teeth are fo exceeding vehement: they have five little nerves from our firft pair,
which are fpread abroad within, and by fmall twigs mixed with the mucilaginous
fubftance in themiddle o f the teeth; as alfo little arteries to give natural heat and
nourifhment, and little veins to carry back the blood after nutrition.
T he tongue-bones are feated under the lower jaw , and in theuppermoft part o f
the larynx. They are commonly accounted but one bone, though made up of three;
T he ufe o f thefe bones is to keep the throat open, both for the pafiage of the food,
and for receiving in o f air in fpeaking or breathing.
T he bones of the ears are the leaft o f all, being the bones fubfervient to hearing;
and are four on each fide. They are all placed in the firft cavity; their fubftance
is hard and denfe, but hollow within, that they might be lighter, and contain mar­
row for their nouriftiment; they are as big in new-born babes as in men, but not fo
hard. T h e principal o f thefe bones are called malleus, the hammer; incus, the anvil;
Jiapes, the ftirrup; and cs orbhularey which is round and fmall, joined by a fmall li­
gament to the ftirrup fide, where it isjoined to the anvil. T h e ufes o f thefe bones
are to ferve the fenfe o f hearing, and to make a pafiage for the excrements o f the
ears: for the ftirrup, (hutting the oval, is moved by the anvil, and the anvil being
fmitten by the hammer, and the hammer by the membrane o f :he drum, through
the impulfc oftheexternal air, the membrane o f the drum is in the mean while driven
inwards, whereby the inbred air is affected, which, pafling through the cochlea,
caufes the branches o f the auditory nerve to receive the fpecies o f founds, and to
communicate the fame to the brain.
The bones of the'neck, and the whole vertebree o f the back, from the cranium
or (hull to the os coccygis or crupper-bone, are termed fpina, the thorn, becaufe the
hinder part of it is (harp-pointed like a thorn-branch. T he parts o f the fpine are
called vertebra) whirl-bones, becaufe by their means the body is turned feveral ways.
30. S A il
C6
A ll thefe vertebras are hollowed to contain the fpinal marrow; they are many, for the
convcniency o f motion. T h e figure is l'ometimes inclining inwards, as the verte­
bras o f the neck, to fuftain the g u llet; and afpera arteria; and the vertebrae o f the
loins, to uphold the trunks o f the aorta, and cava defeending: fometimes outwards,
as the verteora o f the back, and a little o f the os facrum, that there may be a larger
fpace for the heart, lungs, bladder, anus, womb, & c. T he figure o f each verte­
brae, above and below, is plain and broad, that luxation may not eafily be m ade:
round within, convex, and bunching out; but in the neck broader, and more even.
T h e vertebra o f the back are in number twelve, to which as many ribs anfwer.
Thefe vertebra are round on the fore-part, but behind fomewhat hollow. They are
thicker than thofe o f the neck, lofs folid, and full o f little holes for the paffage o f
the nourifiiing veflels.
T h e vertdfra o f the loins are five in number; and belong to the abdomen or
]ower b elly: they are thicker and greater than thole o f the bread, becaufe they
uphold then, and the lowcrmoft are biggeft. Their figure is long and lemi-circu-
lar» their fubftance fpongy, and full o f holes to give paffage to the veins; their
connexion is loofer than that o f the back, that we might the more eafily (loop to the
ground.
T he osfacrum is broad and immovable, being the bafis or foundation o f the back,
upholding the whole frame o f the vertebra. In infants it is commonly com pofedof
fix bones united by a cartilage, but in men o f ripe years it feems but one bone, at the
firft view, yet, being boiled a long time in oil, it is divided for the moll part into
fix feveral vertebras; for each o f them has a body, and proceffes, and has a large
hole to receive the fpinalis medulla. But in this they differ from the other vertebra,
becaufe in thofe the lower part is the bigger, but in thefe the fmaller; wherefore,
the uppermoft is the biggeft, and the loweft the leaft. Its figure is almoft triangu­
lar : in its fore-part hollow, fmooth, and even ; in its hinder-part, bunching and
rough, with little holes to fend out nerves.
T h e os coccyges, the crupper or rump-bone, is under the former, confiftingof three
bones and two griftles, and is called os coccygis, the cuckoo’s bill, from the iikenefs
thereof. It isjoined by a cartilage; for the firft bone o f it has a fmall hollownefs
which receives the laft vertebras o f the os facrum. O f thefethree bones, the lower is
ftill the fmaller: and in men, they are bent inwards to flay the great gut, and the
fphinfler mufcle which are tied to i t : but in women they bend outward to give
way to the womb in the time o f travail. Thefe bones are o f a fpungy and foft
fubftance, and have neither procefs nor any hollownefs. Their union with the os
facrum is loofe, to give way for the exclulion o f large excrements; for otherwife a
luxation
C U L P E P F . R » s E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
luxation might happen, caufing exceeding great pains ; as in hard labour it now
fometimes happens.
T he os innomnatum, the hoop-bone, or flank-bone, confifts of three bones, viz.
os ilium, osifcbhn, and os pubis, all which are joined together by griftles till about
thefeventh year: afterwards, elpecially in thofeof ripe years, the cartilages being
dried, they feem to be but one bone. Thefe three bones, together with the os facrum,
make that cavity which is called pelvis, the bafon or bowl, which is bigger in a wo­
man than In a man, that the womb o f a woman with child may the better red upon it.
In hard labour the fhare-bone, or os pubis, and the os facrum, will part, the car­
tilages and ligaments (being bedewed with fuperfluous humidity) giving way. x.
Os ilium, the huckle-bone, fo called becaufe it contains the gut ilium, is the firft
part, the higheft, the broadeft, and the greateft, in figure femi-circular, arched with­
out and hollow within : the femi-circle is called fpina, the arched part dorjum, and the
hollow part cojla. 2. Os pubis, the fhare-bone, is feated in the fore-part; and is
parted in the middle by a cartilage not very hard: it is joined to the bone o f the
other fide by fyncondtofis, which in women is twice as thick and as wide as in men,
that thefe bones in child-bearing may not be luxated or disjointed, but only bofened
and made wide for the coming forth o f the child. 3. Osifcbion, the hip-bone, is the
lower and more outward part, wherein is a large and deep cavity, called acetabulum,
the faucer, or pixis, the box, which receives the large head o f the thigh-bone: the
cartilaginous procefs o f this cavity is called fupcrcillum, the brow. T h e coxendix
is placed between the huckle and fhare-bones, and 1$ knit to the os facrum by a
double ligament; the one is inferted into the fharp procefs o f the h ip ; the other be­
hind, into its appendix, that the inteftinum redtum and its mulcles may be fuftained.
T h e cofta, or ribs, in figure refemble a bow, or fegment o f a circle; their original
from the vertebra is narrower and rounder, growing broader as they come to the
breaft: in their upper tides they are blunt and th ick ; in their under part fharp and
thin? the uppermoft ribs are more crooked and fhorcer; the middlemoft are longer
and broader; the lower are cut again fhorter. Their fubflance is partly cartilaginous,
and partly boney, the boney part being towards the vertebra where they are fur-
nifhed with two little apophyfes or knobs: the firft o f which is articulated with the
hollow o f the vtrtebne: the fccond is joined to the tranfverfe procefs o f the vertebra:
but the five lower ribs by a Ample knob. T h e number o f the ribs are twelve on
each fide: feldom thirteen, more rarely eleven : and, when they are fb found, you
may account their numbers either fupernumerary or deficient. They are two-fold,
viz. either legitimate and true, or illegitimate and falfe. T he trueorlegitim ateare
thefeven upper ribs, becaufe they touch the breaft-bone by their length, and make
3
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 67
as
63
as it were a circle: they alio make a perfett articulation with the breaft-bone. T he
illegitimate or baftard ribs are the five lower ribs, which arelhorter,fmaller, and fofeer,
not reaching to the breaft-bone : they are femi-circular and arched without, hollow
within: they terminate into longer griftles than the true ribs, which, being turned
back upwards, ftick one to another, the laft excepted, which is the Icaft, and fticks
to none. The eleventh rib, and fometimes the twelfth, are tied to the feptum trani-
verfum ; and fometimes the laft grows to the oblique defeendent mufeles o f the belly,
without the m idriff; or has the circumscription o f its propermufcle. T he ufe of the
ribs is to defend the breaft, and the heart, lungs, and other bowels, therein contain­
ed •
, as alfo to help the motion o f the breaft and parts adjacent, in fuftaining the
mufcles and fldhy parts thereof.
T h e fternum, or breaft-bone, is placed upon the fore-parc o f the cheft, and refts
upon the ribs: its fubftanceis partly boney, but fpungy and red-, partly griftly; its
figure is convex, broad, and long. It is compofed o f three bones, as may be feen
in young people ; but in old men it commonly appears but one: they arediftinguifh-
ed by tranfverfe lines, and are knit together by fynchondrofis, for griftles are inter-
pofed like ligaments. Under this is the pit o f the ftomach, where the upper and left
orifice is, called fcrobiculus cordis. T h e ufe of the fternum is, firft, to defend the
heart (like a faield) from outward dangers ; fecondly, to uphold the mediaftinum:
thirdly, to colled and fallen the ribs.
T h e collar-bones, being in number two, are called clavimhs^ keys, becaufe they
fhut up the breaft or thorax * and as it were lock the fcapula, or fhoulder-blades, to
the fternum. They are fuuated crofs-wife, under the lower part o f the neck, on the
top o f the thorax on each fide: externally, they are convex, on the infide a little
concave: their fubftance is thick, but fiftulous and fpungy, and therefore eafily bro­
ken*, their fuperficies are rough and uneven. T heir ufe is to a(lift in the various
motions o f the arm s; as alfo to uphold the (houlder-blades, that they fliould not fall
upon the breaft, together with the fhoulder-bone; moreover the bone o f the arm
refts upon this bone, as upon a prop, that it may be the more eafily moved upwards
and backwards. Hence brutes have no collar-bone, the ape, Iquirrel, hedge-hog,
and moufe, excepted.
T h e fhoalder-blade is a broad and thin bone, refting upon the upper ribs behind,
like a fliield. Its fubftance is hard and folid ; its figure almoft triangular, the out-
licle fomewhat arched, but the infide hollow •, it has alfo a fpine or (harp point,
looking both above and beneath the cavities, called interfeaputia. In the infide o f
this bone, about the middle, there is a hole, by which a vein doth pafs for its
nouriftimcnc. It has five epipbyfes, three at the infide, and two at the bafis: it has
alfo
C U L P E P E R S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y .
alfo ligaments, which join its head to the humerus and the acromion^or fhouUlcr to the
clavicula: and common, thin, and membranous, ligaments, which compafs the joint
o f thelhoulder blade and arm. Its ufes are, i. to ftrengthen the ribs : z. for the ar­
ticulation o f tht humerus and clavictila: 3. for the infertion o f the m ufcles: 4. to co­
ver the heart, and defend the back from being hurt.
Oshrach'tiy or bone o f the arm, called alfo the Ihoulder-bone, is but one, grea%
ftrong, long, roundilh, and uneven. Its fubftance is hard and folid ■, it is hollow all
along within, containing marrow, but at the two ends more broad, and a little fpun-
gy. In its upper part it has an appendix, epiphyfis, or great head, growing to it \
which is round, covered with a griftle, and articulated with the fcapula or diar-
tbrofts. In the top o f it is alfo a long chink, through which the nervous head o f
the mufculus biceps doth pafs. T h e longer part is articulated to the ulna and radius,
where there are two apopbyfis\ an external, which is lefs, and crufted with a griftle;
and an internal, having two cavities, reprefenting a pulley, with which the cubit is
joined by ginglyms^ fothat it may be bent to am oft acute angle, but not extended
beyond a right line.
T h e bones of the cubit, or elbow, are tw o : the fmaller above, called radius, and
a larger below, called ulna. T h ey are (horter than the fhoulder, have epipbyfes on
either fide, and} refting mutually one upon another, arejoined by a membranous li­
gament : above, the ulna receives the radius *
, but below, the radius receives it.
Their fubftance is firm and folid, they are long, and contain a marrowy fubftance;
but their furface is fomewhat rough, by reafon o f the lines appointed for the
mufcles.
Carpus, the wrift, hath eight diftindt bones, all o f them unequal, and differing in
ftiape and magnitude. A t firft they are griftles, afterwards fpungy bones, covered
with very ftrong griftly ligaments, which faften them together as if they were but
one bone : thefe ligaments, arifing from the lower proceflfes o f the ulna and radius,
ferve for articulation : but there are angular or ring-ftiaped ligaments, which are
tranfverfe, and compafs the wrift, to comprehend, ftrengthen, and Jafely carry, the
tendons, which pafs through the carpus \ thefe are many, though they feem to be
but one ligament, the internal comprehend the tendons o f the mufcles which bend
the fingers; the external, the tendons o f the mufcles which extend them.
T ht metacarpus, or palm o f the hand, has four bones, o f a hard and folid fub­
ftance, and hollow, containing marrow * they are round, and bigger than thole o f
the fingers that which anfwers to the fore-finger is biggeft, and fo (till the lower-
moft are fmaller. Between each bone a diftance is left for the mufeuli interojhci of
the fingers: and in the palm there is a tranfverfe ligament, which ties the bones of
$i- 9* the
7°
the fingers to the metacarpium. A bove and beneath they have epipbyfes: by the up­
per, they arejoined to the carpus, or wrift j by the lower, they enter into the hollow-
ncfs o f the fingers.
T h e bores o f the fingers are in number fifteen, each o f them having three bones,
and anfwering the bones o f the metacarpus, the thumb excepted. T h e thumb has
no connexion with the bones o f the metacarpium, hecaule it is articulate with the
wrift, with a manifeft motion *
, whereas the bones o f the palm arejoined to the wrift
without manifeft m otion; as alfo becaufe the upper o f the thumb is fhorter than
the bones of the metacarpium, and not anfwerable to them. Each finger has liga­
ments on t ieir infides, according to their length, like channels, whereby they are
faftencd one to another.
T h e thigh has but one bone, which is the greateft and longeft in the whole body.
In its fuperior extremity, the head is round, to which a fiender part is added, called
the neck ; from the neck are two apophyfes produced, to which the mufcles, called
rotatores, are fattened, and therefore they are called trochanters. T h e lower part o f
the thigh has two low prominences or heads, called condyli, a cavity being left be­
tween o f a thumb’s breadth, through which the veflels pafs, with a nerve o f the
fourth pair, which cavity alfo admits the middle and eminent apopbyfis o f the tibia
or le g ; in like manner the condyli are received by the cavities o f the leg, by a loofe
articulatioD, called ginglymus: the inner o f thefe heads is more thick, the outer more
broad and dat. T h e upper part o f 'this articulation is called the knee, the hinder-
moft the ham.
T h epatdla, or knee-pan, is fomewhat round, about two inches broad, plain, with­
out having many holes, but within bunched, and there covered with a cartilage r
its fubftancc in young children is cartilaginous, but in grown perfons boney; its
figure is almoft like a buckler or fhield its fituation is upon the jointing o f the
thigh and leg, where the knee is compaffed with a membranous ligament, the patella
excepted. It grows to, and is fattened by, certain thick tendons o f fome mufcles o f
the thigh ; as the fecond, third, and fourth, mufcles, which extend the tibia, and
pafs by the knee to it, and are inferted into the fore-knob o: i t : its ule is taken from
its fituation, being fetbefore the thigh-bone and tibia, to ftrengthen the articulation,
left the thigh-bone, in going down any hill, fiiould flip out forwards; as alfo to de­
fend the tendons o f the mufcles.
T h e fhank, or leg, is compofed of two bones •, the one, being the inner and the
greater, is called tibia \ the other fibula. Tibia, the fhank-bone, has in its upper
part a procefs in the middle, which is received by the cavity o f the thigh-bone. It
isjoined to the thigh-bone by ginglymus\ the.fibula only cleaves to the tibia, and
touches
C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 7i
touches not the thigh-bone. In the lower part there is an apophyfis void o f flefh,
flicking out with a bunch near the foot, which is called malleolus internus, the inner
ancle-bone; as the proccfs o f the fibula is called malleolus externus, the outward
ancle-bone. Fibula^ the button, (becaufe it feems to button together the mufcles
o f the fliank,) which is alfo called fura, the calf j is a firm bone, being drawn along
before the tibia without, as the radius before the cubit. T h e upper end with its
round head fubfifts beneath the knee-, but, with its hollownefs, it receives the la­
teral knob, which is under the epiphyfis in the upper end o f the tibia. In the mid­
dle there is adiftance between the tibia and fibula, in which fpace, is a thin broad
ligament, joining thefe bones in longitude, and where alfo the mufeies o f the feet
arc placed.
T h e bones of the tarfus, or inftep, are feven. Jftragalos, the game-bone, to which
are joined the great and fmall focile. Pterna, the fpu rof the foot, or heel-bone,
into which the greateft and ftrongeft chord or tendon in the whole body is inferted.
Os naviculare, from its likenefs to a boat j it is long, bunched without, and hollow
within, and covered with a cartilage. Os tejferayor die-fhaped bone, becaufe it hath
fix fides; it is greater than the red, and placed before the heel, joined to the fourth
and fifth bone o f the metatarfus: in the hinder with the heel-bone: the other Tides
are joined to no bones. Cuneiformiay calcoideaythe wedge-like bones, or bones o f the
foot, and are articulated with the fcaphoides, or os naviculare: being joined, they
reprefent a vau lt; for above they are convex, beneath hollow, to receive the ten­
dons and mufcles.
T he metatarfus, or foie o f the foot, has five bones, which are folid without, hol­
low within, longer than the bones o f the back o f the hand, and knit to the bones of
the tarfus. That which flays the great toe is the thickeft, that which flays the next
toe is the longeft, the next is (hotter, and the reft each (horter in order. T h e lower
end of that which flays the great toe, is received by the cunciforme majus: the fe-
cond by the cuneiforme minus: the third, by the third wedge*like bone: the other
two, by the two tops o f the os cubiforme.
T he bones of the toes are in number fourteen: the great toe has only two, the reft
three apiece. They are folid without, hollow within; and have three joints and two
procefles, anfwering in all things to the bones o f the hand. The lowermoft joints
have two knobs, received by the ends o f the middlemoft joints, but the uppermoft

T H E abdomen isall that part, diftinguifhed within (by the midriff) from the cheft
to the ospubis. It is bounded by the cartilago mucronata,, vertebra o f the loins, os
facrumy hip bones, os pubisy and the baftard ribs on either fide. It is divided into
three regions or parts: firft, the uppermoft, called epigajrinmy each fide o f which
is called bgpocbondriumy lying under the griftles o f the flior: ribs: it is bounded be­
tween the cartilago mucronata: fecondly, the middle part, called regio umbilicalisy
which extends from three inches above the navel to three inches below i t : the lower
part, called bypogaftrium; the lateral parts are called inguinsythe groins; in the right
fides o f which, are parts o f the colon and cacum, which are tied together; in the left,
a great part o f the colon and inteftinumretlum; the fore-part o f it is called aqualicidusy
and the lowed part, which is covered with hair, is called pubesy the lhare; the hair
begins to appear here in girls about the twelfth year, but in boys about the four­
teenth year, o f age. Under this region in women are contained the bladder, matrix,
and intejimm reftum.

T h e peritoneum, is fo called from ftretching and fpreading about, beingdrawn over
’all the parts between the m idriff and thighs. Its original is from the firft forma­
tion, at the third vertebra o f the loins, where it is thicker, fo that it cannot, in that
place, be leparated without breaking. T h e mufcles o f the belly being taken away,
the peritoneum comes to view : it is tied above to the midriff j below to the fhare and
flank bones; in the fore- part firmly to the tranfverfe mufcles, but chiefly to their
tendons about the tineaalba, behind to the flefhy heads o f thefe mufcles. It is fper-
matical, cold and dry by nature, and o f a fubftance not Ample and uniform, but dou­
ble, and unequal in thicknefs. It is a membrane double in all places, but it is moft
apparent about the vertebra o f the loins, where, between the duplications, lie the
vena cava, the aorta, and the kidneys. Its ufe is to fend connections to all the p«.'
to beftow coats upon all the bowels o f the abdomen ; to give a covering to the c..
phragm, liver, and fpleen; to produce the ligament which upholds the liver •, to
make a communion with all the principal parts by veins, arteries, and nerves *
, to
produce the omentum; and, by its reduplication, the mefentery.
T he omentum,or caul, fo called, becaufe it floats or fwims upon the gu ts: it lies
under the peritonaeum, and is Atuated at the liver, fpleen, and bottom o f the ftom ach:
in fome it ceafes at the navel, in others it falls below the navel, and fometimes it
reaches to the espubis, where it is inferred. It is a thin membrane, endowed with
much fat, double, and disjoined. In men, when it defeends into the ferotum, it
caufes the rupture epiplocele, which happens moft commonly on the left ftde, becaufe
it is extended rather to the left than to the right fide. Its fubftance is membranous,
that it might admit dilatation and extenfion ; it is compact, to hinder rhe difliparion
o f the internal heat, and to repel the external cold : it is tied to the ftomach, being
a middle part between the colon and the fpleen. Its ufes are to cherifh and ftrength-
en the internal heat o f the ftomach and inteftincs •
, to give nourifhment to the parts
in time o f famine ; to contain the humours flowing from the if.teftines, which the
glandulus cannot receive wholly at one time ; to prop up the branches o f the veins
and arteries o f the ftomach, duodenum, colon, and fpleen; and to generate the fat.
T h e ftomach, called ventrietdus, from its cavity, is Atuated in the cpigafirium, a
place encompaffed with no bones, that it might ftretch the morceafily, immediately
under the midriff, which it toucheth, fo that, if it be too full, it caufeth a difficulty
of breathing, by hindering the motion of it. In the fore-part and on the right fide,
it is covered with the hollow of the liver ■, in the left by the fpken ; fo that the fto­
mach is as it were between two Ares, bending a little towards the left bypoebondrium,
and cowards the back part it leans on the aorta, the cava, and the pancreas, which
helps its heat. It is lefs in women than in men, to give way to the diftenfion of the
3 !* matrix,
74
matrix, and it is compofed o f three tunicles ; the outwardmoft is common from the
peritonauniy and is the thickeft ; the middlemoft is proper to Kiel!, and flcfhy *
, the
innermoft is from the dura w m , and wrinkled, as alio hairy like a piece o« (ilk :
this is continued with the tunicle o f theafipbagusy mouth, and lips, that nothing .nay
be received in which is ungrateful to the ftomach - hence it is that, when cooler is in
the (lomacli, the tongue is bitter and yellow. It is fpungy, and has paflavt s like
Ihort fibres, from this inner furface to the outward, that the thinner cbylus may be
the better detained. T h e inmoft coat ferves chiefly for fenfe ; the middlemoft for
the office of m otion; and the third, that it m ight be as a covering for the whole.
T h e ftomach has two orifices, and both o f them in the upper region thereof; the
left is called osftomach'^ the right the pylmiSy or porter*, the os flomaebiy or left ori­
fice, has orbicular fibres, that, the meat and drink being once received within the ca­
pacity o f the ftomach, it m ay, by a natural inftinft, exactly shut up the mouth o f the
ftomach, left the fumes and heat ihould break out, which m ight not only go into
the brain and breed difeafes there, but alfo hinder concoction. T h e right orifice is
o f equal height with the other; left the meat and drink fhould flip through before
they are digefted. It is not wide like the former, becaufe it is to tranfmit the elabo­
rated chyle, which is done by the ttrength o f the ftomach, in contracting itfelf.
W herefore the pylorus, befides its tranfvcrfe fibres, has a thick and compaCt circle,
reprefenting thefphinfler mufcle, that it m ight the moreeafily fhut and open. T h e
ftomach has arteries from the ramus cosliacus, which accompany every vein, that
blood may be fupplied from the heart for nourilhment o f the p art: it has likewife
many nerves; viz. two in its orifice from the ftomach branches, which being pro­
duced, after they have run back in the thoraxy and furnifhed the lungs and pericar-
aium, are covered with ftrong membranes. Thefe fo crofs one another, that they
are carried obliquely, and without doubt with greater fafcty. T h e right branch
compafTes the fore and left part o f the mouth o f the ftom ach; the left branch, the
hinder and right part o f the fame : from thefe branches of nerves are fent down­
wards, to the very bottom ; a branch goes from the left ne-ve, along the upper part
✓
o f the ftomach, to the pylorus, which it infolds with certain branches, and goes to
the hollow of the liver: other two nerves alfo go to the bottom o f the ftomach,
from the branches which run along by the roots o f the ribs. Hence it is, that, when,
the brain is hurt, the ftomach is Tick, and falls a vomiting, as in a vertigo, bemicrania9
& c. alfo, when the ftomach is aflfe&ed, the head and brain are ill, or afflicted with
pain; and by reafon that the orifice o f the ftomach is fo compafled with nerves, as
if it were altogether made o f nerves, it becomes o f a moft exquifite fenfe; and hence
it is that vomiting fo often fucceeds in many difeafes, where there is a confent o f
parts
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 75
parts with the ftomach. T he ftomach is the feat o f hunger, and does the firft o f all
parts feel the want o f food ; (afterwards the other parts by faintnefs and univerfal
debility;) for, the blood being fpent upon the nourifhment o f the body the fibres of
the internal membrane o f the ftomach are contracted, and fo this pain, whichis
called hunger and thirft, is caufed.
T he inteftines, or guts, begin at thepylorus, and end in the anus or fundament.
They are called inteftinayor inwards, becaufe they are in the inmoft feat o f the body.
They are o f a round figure, that they might the better contain the nourifhment; o f
a membranousfubftance, the better to have conftriPtion and dilatation; and indeed
their fubftance is almoft the fame with the ftomach, having three coats, one com­
mon and external, being bred immediately from the mnfenterium, but mediately
from the peritoneum. The fecond, which is the middlemoft, is proper, being mem­
branous, ftrong, and furniihed with flefhy fibres. T h e third, which is the inner-
moft, is alfo proper, nervous, and lined with a crufty fubftance, framed o f the ex­
crements o f the third conception o f the guts, glazed as it were with a mucus or
phlegmatic fubftance, bred in the firft concoPtion, by which excoriation is not only
hindered, when (harp humours pafs through the guts, but alfo by its afliftance the
expulfion o f the fceces is furthered. T h is internal membrane has fuch a crufty
fubftance, that the mouths o f the meferaic veins might not be (topped; and that
neither they nor the coat itfelf might be made callous by the continual thoroughfare
o f the chyle. T h e fibres o f the internal membrane o f the find! guts are oblique,
but o f the external coat tranfverfe; becaufe thefe are appointed for the retention
and expulfion of the chyle: but, in the thick guts, the inner coat has tranfverfe
fibres, the outward has oblique and ftraight, becaufe they are appointed for the ex-
pulfion of the excrements: the inner membrane alfo o f the linall guts is full o f
wrinkles to ftay the cbylus from pafling too foon. A s to the length o f the inteftines,
they are in general fix times as long as the whole body: it is wonderful that the
guts (of fo great a length) (hould be comprehended in fo fmall a compafs, fo as that
they are not above a fpan diftant from the centre. T hey have a motion, which is
pcriftaltic, or the worm-like motion, by which they move thcmfelves all over by a
contraption from the upper parts downwards; moreover they have many turnings
and windings, or bendings, which ferve to keep the nutriment, till the conception
is perfectly finifhed, and chyle diftributed.
The menfentery, is lb called, becaufe it is the middle o f the guts. It is one in
number, but divided into two parts, the ntefareum and mefocoh:. By rhe mefareum>
the fmall guts are knit together; by the mefocolon, the thick guts are tied together.
The fubftance o f the mefemcry is a double membrane, one above another. Its ficuo-
tioa
tion is in the middle o f the abdomen, flicking to the tranf/erfe precedes o f the ver+
iehra by ligaments, whence is its original: for it ariles from the firft and third ver­
tebras o f the loins, where membranous fibres are produced from the peritonaum,
which turn into flrong membranes. T h e veflels o f the mefentery are veins, arteries,
and nerves, which pafs to and from the guts, between the membranes. T h e veins
are called mefaraka, and they are two-fold, viz. fanzuinea and laflea, both which are
almoft innumerable. T h e venafangitinea, or meferaica, receive the blood from the
arteries, after nourifhing o f the parts, and fo convey it back again to the liver.
T h e venalaStea, afeending from the guts, and carrying the chyle, do centre in the
glandules, or receptacles o f the chyle. Thcfe glandules of the mefentery, are to prop
up and fupport fundry diftributions o f the branches to the vena porta and arteria
magna\ and hence it is, that about the centre o f the mefentery are the greateft ker­
nels, becaufe there is the diflribution o f the greater and more collected vefiels: if
thofe become feirrhous, an atrophia, or extenuation o f the w.iole body, viz. a walling,
ieannefs, and pining, follow s, becaufe the palling of the chyle is hindered, where­
by the nourilhment o f the body is loft. Their fubftance in men is glandulous and
folid, like other glands o f the mefentery, watered as it were with the vena laftea%
yet capable o f chyle in their leaft corners. T heir connexion is in the hinder part
vertebra Imbares: in the fore part they are joined to the mefentery by fmall m ilky
brancltes, which carry the chyle to thefe fountains or receptacles. T h e ufe o f thefe
m ilky glandules is to receive and contain the chyle coming from the venae lafteae o f
the mefentery: as all'o to digeft and prepare it by the help o f the neighbouring hot
veflels, viz. the artery and vein, and then, being prepared* to thruft it out into the.
tboraices, and other parts, as the liver, which is eafily proved by ligature; for, if thefe
laftea, whether in the thorax or going to the liver, be bound, they always fwell on
that fide next to the glandules or mefentery, and grow empty on the other fides:
they alfo fqueeze out the ferttm, being feparated from the chyle in that light prepa­
ration, and.expel it either into the reins adjacent to them ; or into the emulgent ar­
teries, to which they fend branches; or into the capfulas atribilirite, appointed for
melancholy*, or, laftly, into the doubling o f the peritoneum,, in which they abide,
which is fometimes the caufe o f the drepfy afeites: and herein we have reafon why a
dropfy is many times ended by diuretics and difiolved by urine; and how thofe,
who are extreme drinkers, do fo immediately evacuate what they have drunk; for
that the ordinary way through the liver, heart, arteries, emulgent veins, ureters,
and bladder, is vaftly longer, and more tedious: hence a lb the caufe is feen, why, in
a real diabetes, the drink is fo voided through the bladder in a very fhort fpace, as
is received, v/ithout change o f confiftency, colour, tafte, or fm ell: hence too ap­
pears

pears the reafon o f an atrophia o f the parts, efpecially thofe of the thorax, which
draw the chyle out o f the m ilky receptacles * for that they are fcmetimes prefled to­
gether, whereby the diftribution o f the chyle is obftru&ed: fometimes alfo they are
inflamed, tumified, and affli&ed with afiirrbus. Hence it is that lithontriptic or ne­
phritic medicaments do prelcntly eafe fuch as have a pain in their reins: as likcwife
cantharides, and fuch as incite to lull, do immediately, without (topping the pafiage,
come to the arteries emulgent and fpermatic 5 becaufe that, in the accuftomed jour­
ney, (much the longer way,) the virtue o f the medicaments would eafily be ener­
vated. And here the reafon is obvious why diuretic and nephritic medicaments
make fuch an impreffion o f fmell and colour in urine, as is manifeft in caflia, turpen­
tine, juniper, afparagus, and other like things. M any o f the lack* o f the mefen-
tery, coming through the greater glandules, and the fldes o f the pcrU, are grafted
into the liver. Their entrance is about the third lobe, to which many o f the latter
from the mefentery and appendices o f the ftomach do come. From the upper part of
the m ilky glandules, immediately under the diaphragm, there arife as many milky
branches as there are glandules, which, through the middle o f thej^//;a, pierce the
diaphragma, and, by mutual infertion, two of them are joined about the firft wrrt-
bra o f the loins j another branch, coming out o f the fecond glandule, about the
twelfth vertebra o f the back, enters a little above the other infertion; but the third,
rifing from the third glandule, is to be feen near the eleventh vertebra, from whence
it arifes as a folicary branch, through the middle o f the back, by che fide o f the aorta,
and the vein azygos, between both, under the cefopbagus, to which it is firmly
knit by its membranes. Thefe m ilky thoracics departing from the fpinal, (about the
third or fifth vertebra o f the back,) through the midft o f which they crept all this way,
turn a little to the left, and creeping up under the eejopbagus and aorta, and under the
fubclavialartery and the glandules o f the thymus, they go forward to the left davimla
and left axillary vein; they enter the vein juft where the outward jugular pours it-
felf forth into the axillary aforementioned. From hence we learn, that thefe tbora-
cics carry the chyle out o f the milky glandules or receptacles o f the mefentery to the
fubclavials-, but the latte* meferaicacarry the chyle from the inteftines either to the
receptacle or tc the liver: alfo chat the chyle goes not to the head nor to the joints,
but is carried to the heart with the blood that runs down in circulation, where it is
changed into the fanguineous humour: and hence the lafte<e of the thorax receive
their reftorative force from nutriment, cordials, and medicaments, out o f the fto-
mach or eefopbagus, by thtglanduU lattea, and carry them ftraitway to the heart:
whence it is, that drinking vinegar, wine, cordials, and other like things, fo immedi­
ately caufe the ftrength to be reftored ; and prefently at meat a nan is ftrengchened,

and his hunger flayed: this virtue is conveyed by the m ilky branch which is
near the esfiphagus^ and the fhort pafiTage o f the reft o f the laP.ee to the heart:
alio vulnerary potions and pectoral drinks come a Ihorcer and furer way to
the heart and lungs, to which, by the long way about through the bowels
and veins, they could not come fo fafe and fecure > and by the fame reafon poi-
fons as fwiftly overcome the heart, infect the vital fpirits, and deftroy their
harmony.
T h e liver is an organic part, and an inftrument o f the blood, (both for generating
and perfecting it,) feated in the abdomen, ju ft under the diaphragma or midriff, in
the right bypocbondrium, about a finger’s breadth diftance therefrom; is covered by
the ribs for fafety, but covers, or lightly refts upon, a great part o f the ftomach. It
is divided as it were into two parts by the umbilical vein, which, after the birth,
ierves it for a ligament. It is laid to be the original or beginning o f the veins, be-
caufe therein the roots o f the two greateft veins appear difperfed, viz. o f the cava
and porta, as roots implanted in the earth; alfo here are to be feen inierted, trunks
and branches o f the vena lafteey arifingfrom the pancreas mefenterii. It is a gtear,
thick, and hard, body; o f a red colour, confifting o f a fubftance proper to itfelfi
fitted and ordained for that end. It differs from the livers of beafts, in that it has
feldom any lobes, yet the hollow part o f it has a fiffure or chink, where the umbili­
cal vein is implanted. Its magnitude is exceeding great, beyond all the other vifeera;
and bigger in man than in any other living creature, the proportion o f body being
confidered; and this feems to be necefTary,confidering the noble ufes and functions
to which it is ordained. T h e aCtion o f the liver is fanguification> for the chyle, be­
ing conveyed to the liver by the vena latter is there fanguified, or made cbymus% for
the fubftance o f the liver doth not only fuftain the veins, but is alfo the efficient o f
fanguification, and o f perfecting the blood by its circular m otion; and, together
with the blood, it generates natural fpirits.
T h e gall-bladder and choler-channel are fituated on the right fide o f the liver, in
the under or hollow part thereof. T h e branches o f both thefe, together with the
branches o f the vena p o r t are comprehended in a common bladder, called capfula.
Thefe branches o f the veficafellis, and duftus choledochus, or biliarmy being detained
in the liver, are difperfed through its whole parenchyma, every where included in the
aforenamed capfula, which is red, about the thicknefs o f an artery, and takes its ori­
ginal from the peritoneum. T h e gall-bladder is a veflel long and round, much like
a pear, hollow, furnifhed with a double membrane. Its magnitude is fmal), com­
pared to the fpleen or kidneys, being about two Inches in length, and in fome perfons
nearly three inches. T h e ufe o f the gall is, i. to caufe a new and more perfect ter-

Jnentation o f the chyle: 2. to prick the guts by its fharpnefs, to dir up their peri-
ftaltic motion, that they may drive down the chyle, and expel the excrements: 3. to
m ix with the chyle in fuch proportion, that, being converted into blood, the blood
might thereby be kept from congelation.

great part, and probably the greater part, o f the blood, earned through the umbi­
lical vein to the liver o f the foetus, by a large paflage to the vena cava and the heart;
but this, after the birth o f the foetus, gradually grows narrower and clofes; K , the
entrance o f the umbilical vein into the Anus o f the vena portae. T o this deferip-

The
So
T h e fpleen, or m ilt, is fituated in the left fide under the Ihort ribs, over againft
the liver, and under the midriff, between the ribs and the ftomach, near to the back
part. Its colour in new-born infants is red, becaufe they have been fed with elabo­
rate blood; but in thofe o f ripe age it is o f a darkifh red colour, and fometimes al-
moft blackifh. It is connected by thin membranes arifing from the peritonaeum, to
the peritonaeumitfelf, caul, and to the left kidney, and fometimes alfo to thefeptum or
diaphragma* T h e action and office o f the fpleen is not to be either the receptacle or
the place o f the generation o f melancholy, (as leveral learned men have thought,)
nor to make blood, (as many others have imagined,) but to highly perfect the blood
already made, that it may ferve as afermentum, both to the daily generated chyle and
all the reft o f the blood in the body: the excrementitious blood which cannot be fe-
parated from the fpleen, if it be thin and watery, is purged out, firft, by the arteries,
not only to the guts, but alfo to the kidneys, by the emulgent veins; hence, in difeafes
o f the fpleen, the urine is many times black, in which cafe we commonly adminifter
diuretics. Secondly, by the ftom ach; whence, in thefeurvy and a quartan ague, the
fick fpits exceedingly •, but, if this excrementitious blood be thick and earthy, it is
voided directly by the anus by proper arteries going the guts, by which means the
ordure is black, as alfo by the internal benmrho'tdal veins, as the great Hippocrates
has often fhewn.
T h e reins, or kidneys, are fituated under the liver and fpleen, by the loins, between
the two coats o f the peritoneum, at the fides o f the cava and aortayunder which very
great nerves lie hid, and reft upon themufcles o f the th igh : whence it is that, a ftone
being in the kidneys, a numbnefs is felt in the thigh and leg o f that fide. T h e left
kidney is for the moft part higheft; the right is loweft to give way to the liver,
reaching by its end the third vertebra o f the loins. T hey confift o f a fubftance folid,
flefhy, thick, hard, and compact, alm oftas the heart, but not fo fibrous. T hey are
conne&ed by an external membrane from theperitoneum to the loins and diapbragma;
by the cm'jlgent veffels to the cava and aorta \ and by the ureters to the bladder.
T h e right kidney is tied to the ccecum> fometimes alfo to the liver: the left to the
fpleen and colon; hence pains o f the reins are exafperated by plenty o f wind and ex-
crements. T h e colour o f the flefh o f the kidneys is red; and through their hollow­
ed fides arc carried the emulgent veins and arteries, proceeding from the trunks o f
the cava and aorta: they have alfo emulgent arteries, which are large, and derived
from the trunk of the aortat which carry blood for nourifliment, and that therefrom
the Jerum which is plentiful in the arterial blood) m aybe feparated: they have alfo
one very fmall nerve on each fide, which Ipringsfrom the ramusftomacbicus, proceed­
ing from the par vagum> and is inferted into the proper membrane o f the kidney;

whence ariles the fympathy between the ftomach and reins; and that they who are
difeafed in the kidneys, by the (tone or Tome other diftemper, are for the moft part
Tick at ftomach, and troubled with vomiting. T he ufe o f the kidneys is to attract
the fanguineous ferofity by the emulgent arteries, that fo the mafs o f blood may be
cleanfed: which blood, going through thefe veflels, is always carried through the
branches o f rhe emulgenrs, diflrminated abroad through the whole parenchymao f the
kidneys, and runs at length into very fmall paflages, fo that at laft the wheyifh hu­
mour is thruft quite out into the flelh o f the kidneys, the good blood remaining
partly to nourifh them, and partly to return by the little emulgent veins, which are
open into the cava, and fo to the heart. T he ferous part is drained through the
papillary caruncles, which have holes into the branches o f the ureters, and after grow
together into one cavity or expanfion o f the ureteryinto which the ferum is emptied:
through the ureters it pafles into the bladder, where it becomes urine.
T he deputy kidneys, or black choler cafes, are fo feated, that they reft upon the
upper part o f the kidneys, on the outfide, where they look towards the vena cavay
being covered with fat membranes. In figure and fubftance they for the moft part
refemble the kidneys, fave that their fiefh is a little loofer: fo that they feem like
little kidneys refting upon the great ones. They have an apparent internal cavity,
furnifhed with a dreggy and black humour; and are ftrongly connected, where
they reft, to the external membrane o f the reins, and to the feptum tranfverfum%to
which they commonly ftick in difle&ion.
T he ureters, are white veflels, like veins, but thicker, whiter, and more nervous;
confiding of a Angle membranous fubftance, inclofed in a duplication o f tbtperito~
naum. They are as long as between the kidneys and bladder, and commonly as
thick or wide as goofe-quills: but, in difle& ionof perfons troubled with the ftone,
they have been (o wide as to admit o f two fingers. Their original is in the kidneys,
within whofe cavities they are divided into nine or ten little pipes or channels,
which are fitted to the little fieftiy teats or caruncuLepapillaresythat they may diftil
the ferum into the pelvis, or bafon, or large cavities o f the ureters within the kid*
neys. T he ureters, defeending within the duplicature o f the peritonaeum, upon the
mufcles o f the loins, to the bladder, are inferted obliquely into its n eck, then, af-
cending upwards between its membranes, they perforate the innermoft coat together,
and through the fame hole they both enter the bladder: in the implantation o f the
uretersytwo little membranes or valves are placed, like the valves in bellows, (hut­
ting up the paflages o f the ureters, lb that the urine cannot go back. They receive
fmall veins and arteries from the neighbouring parts, and nerves from thenar vagum,
and marrow of the loins. Their ufe is to convey the urine from the kidneys into
the bladder.
3 1- r The
The bladder, or receptacle o f urine, is feared between the duplicature o f the
peritoneum) in the cavity o f the hypogaftrium, which is called pelvis, or the bafon;
which in a man lies between the ospubis and intefiimm rcShim; in a woman, between
the ospubis and the neck o f the womb. Its figure is oval or globical, that it might
hold the more; from the bottom it is by little and little ftraightened into a narrow
neck. 1is magnitude is various; and, according to the greamefs o f the lungs, fuch
is the greatrels o f the bladder; and fuch animals as have no lungs have no bladder:
man, according to his magnitude, has of all living creatures the greateft bladder. Its
fubftance is partly membranous, for ftreogth fake, as alfo that it might extend and
wrinkle together. It has two membranes and one mufcle, which m od anatomitts
make to be a third membrane, ant! not a mufcle. T he bottom is faftened to the
pmtoneton, and to the navel by a middle ligament called urachus, and the two naval
arteries dried up. T h e neck o f the bladder is tied in men to the intejlinum reftv.m*
,
but in women to the vagina uteri, or neck o f the womb, and to the neighbouring
hip-bones. T h e bladder has three holes; two a little before the neck, where the
ureters are inferted, and a third in the neck, through which the urine is voided.
T he neck, is ficfhy and fibrous, furnilhed with a fphin£:er mufcle to purfe it up,
that the urine may not pafs out againft our w ill; in men this neck is long, narrow,
and wreathed, becaufe, being placed under the bodies which conftitute the yard, it
runs upwards under the fhare-bones, from the fundament to the origin o f the yard.
In women it is fhort and broad, ftretched forth downwards, and implanted above
into the neck o f the womb. T h e bladder has arteries from thz bypegafirica in men,
and from thofe which go from the neck o f the womb in wom en; by thefe it is
nouriflied ; it has veins all'o from the vena hypogaftrica implanted into the Tides o f its
neck, vaiioufly difieminated through the bladder, which are mutually conjoined one
with another and with the arteries by open holes, that nutritive blood may return ;
and it has nerves from thzparvegum, and from the medulla o f the osfacnim.
T h e fpermatic veflels, in men called vafa preparantia, are two-fold, viz. the two
fpermacic veins, and the two fpermatic arteries- T h e right-fide vein fprings from
the trunk o f the vena cava, a little below the rife o f the emulgent, otherwife it muft
go over thz aorta, and then there would be danger o f breaking; or, at leaft, by
reason of the pulfation o f the artery, the venal blood might be hindered. Both the
feminal arteries arife from the trunk o f the aorta, about two inches diftant from the
emulgcnts; thefe veflels, being a little diftant one from another, are tied together
by a thin membrane from the peritoneum. Thefe fpermatic preparers are greater
in men than in women, and the arteries are greater than the veins, becaufe very
much heat, vital fpirit, and arterial blood, are requifite to make feed. Thefe veflels
Si C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
are
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . *3
are carried obliquely above the ureters to the groins; but in their prog.cfs they are
joined by infinite anaftomofes or inofculations: fo that the arteries are fo coupled
within the coats of the veins, as if they were but one veflfcl, and they are knit toge­
ther by a membrane arifing from the peritoneum, and afterwards carried to the begin­
ning o f the tefticles, like a tendril o f a vine, being fo interwoven that a curious eye
cannot difringuiTi a vein from an arrery. This intertexrure o f veins and arteries be­
ing the twiftings o f the vafapreparantia, makes a long, thick, glandulous, but hard,
cord, called corpus varicofum, which is without any remarkable cavity. Thelc veflels
do not pafs through the peritoneum, as in dogs, but are carried between its double
coat, with a fmall nerve from the par vagum and the mufcle cremeftcr, and, parting
to the bottom of the tefticle, end at the vas deferens. Thefe arteries carry blood and
fpirits (in whole admirable windings they are more elaborated) to the tefticles, from
whom they have a virtue feminal: with this blood the ftones are nourifhed, and part
o f it becomes feed: the veins are elofely interwoven with the arteries about the
tefticle, and joined to them by mutual anaftomofe; that they may carry back the
blood which remains unto the left emulgent, or to the vena cava on the right fide,
from whence the fpermatic vein commonly fprings. I f one or both the fpermatic
arteries be injured, or wanting, as they are fometimes, fuch perfons doubtlefs can­
not get children, but muft neceflarily be barren.
The tefticles in men, are glandulous bodies, flaggy, fpungy, foft, and white, with­
out any cavity, full o f fmall veins and arteries, fuch as are not in any other part o f
the body. Their figure is oval, but it fometimes varies, according to the curgency
o f any o f the neighbouring vefTels. T he right tefticle is hotter, and better concoCts
the feed, than the left: becaule the former receives the arterial blood immediately
from the aorta, the latter from the emulgent. They are feated externally without
the abdomen, under the belly, at the root of the yard, in the ferotum or covering :
being commonly in men anfwerable to the bignefs o f a fmall hen’segg. The mem­
branes being taken away, the fubftance o f the tefticle comes in fight, upon which,
athwart, is placed a fmall body, called corpus vermiforme, to the one end whereof
cleaves thtvasfpermaticumdeferens, the carrying fpermatic veflel, which enters into the
fubftance of the tefticle, and empties the feminal matter thereinto: from the other
end arifes the vas ejaculatorium, which in the beginning is full o f turnings and
windings, and cleaves firmly to the tefticle, by its ends, being loole, and feparate
in its middle. They have veflels o f all forts, veins and arteries from the feminal vef-
fels, and a large nerve from thepar vagum: fometimes alfo they have two nerves from
the twenty-firft pair o f the fpinal marrow, which, being conjoined with the fperma­
tic veflels, are carried with them through the production of the peritoneum, and
difleminated
diflcminated into the tuniclcs. They have on each fide one proper mufcle, called
crmafttr or fufpenfor: and a common mufcle, from the membrane o f the fcrotum,
called dartos. T h e tefticles have alfo fcveral tunicles, coats, or coverings *
, o f which
two are common: three proper to themfelves only. T h e firft common coat (which
is to defend the part) is conftituted o f the (kin and fcarf-fkin, and is called fcrotum
or burfafcrotiy bccaufe it is like a purfe or b a g : it is foft, wrinkled, and void o f fat:
having in its lower part a line, according to the length thereof, which divides into
a right and left part, and is called futura%or a (earn. The fecond common coat
confifts o: a flelhy membrane, fpringing from the mmbrana carnofa> which is here
thinner than in other places, and full o f veins and arteries, and is called dartus: this
by many is comprehended under the term fcrotum. T h e firft proper coat is called
vaginaliSy the fcabbard coat \ and elicoidesyfrom its thinnefs, which is yet ftrong and
full o f veins, arifing from the procefles o f the periton£umy and cleaving to the
dartos by many membranous fibres, whence its exterior part is rough, its interior
fmooth. T h e fecond proper coat is called erythroides, becaufe o f its rednefs: it has
fome flelhy fibres from the cremafter, from which it is propagated, and is fpread over
the vaginalis. T h e third and innermoft, called albigineayarifing from the coat o f the
fpermatic vefiels, immediately encompafles the fubftance o f the (tones, and as it
were binds the fame, being white, thick, and ftrong. The ufe o f the tefticles is to
elaborate the feed, and to make it, by their heat and inbred facu lty: for the efficient
caufe of the feed is the properparenchyma o f the tefticles, both in regard o f their hot
and moift temper, and o f their fpecific property; for, the blood being prepared,
they convert it into feed; what remains over and above frrves for nourifhment o f
the part, and the remainder is conveyed back, by the fpermatic veins, to the
heart.
T h e vafa de/erentia, are the veflels carrying away the feed, and thefe begin at the
tefticles, and end at the root o f the yard, whither they carry and ejaculate the fe~
minal humour; being in number two, on each fide one. N ow thefe vafa deferentiay
called alfo meatus JeminaleSy are divided into three parts; the beginning, middle,
and end: under which are comprehended, the parafirattythe vafa ejaculatoriay the
vefteuhe fminaksyand the projlata. T h e parafiratCy or afliftants, are the beginnings
o f the vafa deferentia. Their fubftance is o f the middle nature, between that o f
the tefticles and that o f the vafa ejaculatoriay being within glandulous and fpungy,
but without membranous. They have their origin in ihe ftones, making many
anaftomefes there, with the vafa preparantiayby means o f innumerable fmall pipes,
or white fibres. T he ufe o f the paraftrau is to perfeft and finilh the feed, by a
virtue which they receive from the tefticle, and, while the feed is lodged in them,
frequent
S+ C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
frequent luft is not provoked. T h e vafa ejaculatoria are the middle o f the vafa
deferentia, properly fo called *
,thefe convey the feed from the paraftatx or corpora va-
ricofa to the veficulse feminales. Their fubftance is white and nervous : their figure
long and round, with an obfcure cavity or hollownefs: their fituation is partly in
the tefticles, partly in the cavity o f the abdomen, above the os pubis or (hare-bone;
for they run upwards and arc knit to the vafa prxparantia by a thin membrane, and
fo are carried along to the flanks and (hare-bone, which for that purpofe have a
flight cavity. After being turned back downwards, they pafs above the ureters,
and under the hinder part o f the bladder j above the inteftinum reiiuniy at the neck of
the bladder, they are on each fide widened, and there conftitute the feminal blad­
ders. VeftculafeminaleSy the feminal bladders, are the end or termination o f the vafa
deferentia: after the conftitution o f thefe bladders, thefe carrying veficls are united
into one fmall Fafl"aSe>and are inferted into the proftatse. Thefe bladders are many
in number like little cells, and feem to make on each fide one remarkable great and
winding one, for that they go one into another, much refemblinga bunch o f grapes.
Their fubftance is nervous, and they are feated between the ligaments o f the blad­
der and the rcCtum, by the Tides o f the vafa ejaculatoria a little before the faid veflels
grow thick and unite. Their ufe is to contain the feed being perfected, and to re-
ferve the fame till the time o f coition, that fo there may be a fufficiency for genera­
tion. T h tproftaUy ftanders before, ftoppers, or conductors, are two certain carun­
cles (in which the vafa deferentia terminate) manifeftly differing from the veficulae
feminales in ufe, form, fituation, and magnitude. Their fituatioi: is at the root o f the
yard, above the fpliincler o f the bladder, on each fide at the ueck thereof. Their
fubftance is fpuigy, yet harder and whiter than any other kernels, and they arc alio
covered with a thicker membrane, being o f exquifite fenfe, that they mighc caufe
pleafure in coition. They are flat before and behind, but round on the Tides: their
magnitude is ufually as big as a walnut, and they are open by certain pores into the
urethra or urinal pafiage, which isevidently apparent in fuch as have died o f a go­
norrhoea, where they have been dilated, and in whom the feat o f that difealedid
lodge. Their ufe is to contain a vifeous and flippery humour, tomoiften the ure­
thra, for the mere eafy and fpeedy paflage o f the feed: and they alfo ferve to (lay
the involuntary efFufionof the feed, and to hinder its regurgitation, being once emit­
ted. They terminate in a fmall caruncle upon the urethra, which as a valve ferves
to hinder thecoming o f urine into them • under and by this caruncle, on each fide,
there are inconfpicuous holes, or pores, through which the feed pafles into the ure­
thra, juft as quickfitver pafles through leather, which it does by virtue o f its
being replete with a vaft quantity o f fubtil and penetrating fpirits. In thefe pores

o f the proftatae, and in the feminal bladders, the feat o f a virulent gonorrhoea lies;
and therefore, if they be broken, hurt, or dilated, either by a catheter putting into
the bladder, or by any other means, there follows immediately an incurable gonorr­
hoea. The diftance between the root of the ferotum and the podex is calledperina-
wn. T h is, with the pubes and ferotum, are furnfihed with hair, becaufe glandules
are placed here, which abound with plenty of humidity, a part o f which they fend to
the fkin for the generating thereof.
Thepenis, or yard, is an organical part, long, and roundifh, but broader on the up­
per fide than where the urethra is, being the male inftrument o f generation, and ap­
pointed for the evacuation o f the feed and urine. It is feated under the os pubis ex-
aftty in the middle, becaufe it is only one in number. Its magnitude is extremely
various in different fubje&s, being for the moft part greater than ordinary in little
m en; alfo in fuch as have large nofes, for the proportion o f the yard very much an-
fwers that o f the nofe; in fuch as have thick, full, large beards; and in ^Ethiopians,
or blackamoors. It confifts o f afcarf-lkin, flefhy membrane, and a proper fubftance
o f its o w n ; but is void o f fat even in the fatteft men, left thereby its moft exquifite
fenfe fhould be dulled. Its proper fubftance is four-fold : firft, the urethra; fecond-
ly, the glans-, thirdly and fourthly, the two nervous bodies, one on each fide. T h e
urethra, or pafiage o f the urine and feed, is a pipe o f a nervous fubftance, o f the fame
bignefs from the neck o f the bladder (to which itisjoined)totheend o f the yard, or
beginning of the glans* for in the middle o f the glans it has a greater hollownefs.
Its fubftance alfo is thick, loofe, and foft,like that o f the two lateral ligaments or
nei vous bodies. T his urethra has alfo two membranes, and a fubftance proper to it*
felf. T h e one membrane is internal, thin, and o f exquifite fenfe, with which alfo the
glans is covered; this fprings from the thin membrane which clothes the nerves o f
the yard** the ocher is external, more thick and fleftiy, andfurnilhed with nerves:
the middle part, which is its proper fubftance, is loofe, fpungy, and black, that it
may be diftended or contracted with the other parts. In the beginning o f its channel
are thefe pores through which the feed is ejaculated, as alfo a little membrane or car­
uncle like a valve ftretched before it, to keep the feed and urine from returning into
the fpermatic veflels: if it be broken or eroded by lharp humours, or the unfkilful
ufe o f a catheter, there follows an incurable gonorrhoea. Its ufe is to be the common
pafiage o f the urine and feed. Balanus^ glans, the head or rut o f the yard, is an hol­
lowed kernel, wider in the middle than at the external orifice : o f a globular form,
even, and compafied with a circle or crown. Its fubftance is fiefh, more folid than
the reft o f the yard, o f a moft exquifite fenfe, and covered with an exceeding thin mem­
brane, foftandred. It is covered with the reduplication o f the externalfkin o f the yard,
2 called
t c C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
calledpreputiumy(a putanda, from cutting off,) the forefkin: this is that which the
Jews cu to ff in circumcifing. T h is (kin is tied at the root o f theglans, by a certain
ligament, calledfr<enumythe bridle, anting from a combination of the tendons o f the
mufcles o f the yard and a nerve, and terminating in the extreme hollowncfs o f the
nut. T he two nervous bodies, or hollow ligaments, one on each tide, confticute
the remaining and greateft part o f the yard the whole fubftance whereof being like
a thick fpungy artery, fluffed with fkfli. Their external fubftance is long, thick,
compact, hard, and nervous ♦, their internal fubftance is fpungy, thin, hollow, o f a
net-like texture, framed o f innumerable twigs o f veins and arteries, o f a dark red
colour, inclining to black, and filled with a great abundance of black blood, very
full o f fpirits, which, waxing hot, caufes a aiftention and erection o f the yard. Thefe
two bodies (where they are thick and round) fpring from the lower parts o f the
fhare-bone, or hip-bones, to which they are ftrongly tied with two ligaments. In
their beginnings they keep fome diftance, being feparate one from another, almofl
like a Y , that the urethra may pafs between them ♦, but, when they ceate to remain
perfectly feparate, viz. when they come to the joining at the fhare-bone, they lofe
near a third part o f their nervous fubftance; yet they ftill remain diftinft by the
coming between o f a Angle membranous partition, called feptum lucidum. T his
membrane is white, thin, tranfparent, and full o f nervous fibres; it arifes from the
upper part o f the commiffure o f the os pubis, and upholds the laid two lateral liga­
ments, and the urethra, as a flay, the like o f which is alfo found in women. T he
yard has all forts o f veffels, as veins, 1. external, running up and down in the fkin,
from the pudenda ; 2. internal ones, from the venm hypogaftrira*, which are fpread
through its whole body. It has arteries, two internal remarkable ones, arifing from
the hypogaftrica, which are inferred into the beginning o f the growing together o f
the two nervous bodies, which are fcattered up and down according to the length of
the part: but in the middle, where the feptum lucidum is thinneft, they fend
branches through the fpaces o f the fibres, the right artery, into the left nervous body,
and the left into the right, carrying fpirits and blood to fill up, erelt, and nourifh,
the yard. It has two nerves from the marrow o f the os facrttmy which diffeminate
themfelves through all parts o f the yard, both internal and external; amending
through the middle o f the forked divifion, they fpread themfelves into the mufcles,
the whole body of the yard, and the glans, that there might be an exquifuc fenfe
and delegation. It has alfo four mufcles, two erectors, and :wo accelerators or
ejaculators, under which mufcles lie hid the two nervous bodies.
The fpermatic veflels in women are the fame with thofe in men, and agree in
their number, nature, original, and office*, but they differ from thofe in men in
the
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . $7
$s
che follow ing th in g s: firft, they differ in their longitude; in women they are fhorter,
by reafon o f the fliortnefs o f the paflige, but they have more wreathings, windings,
and turnings, where they make the corpus varicofum about the telficle, that the feed
may have a fufficient ftay for its due preparation: fecondly, in their infertion ; in
women they pafs not whole to the tefticles, as in a man, but are divided in the m id­
way : whence the greater part goes to the tefticles to form the corpus varicofum ; the
firaller part to the wom b, into whofe Tides it is difleminated, efpecially to the upper
part o f the bottom, to nouriffi the wom b, and the child therein » and that by thofe
veffels fome part o f the menflrual blood m3y be purged forth in fuch as are not with
child. T h is fmalier part is tripartite, being divided below the tefticle into three
branches, o f which one runs out into the wom b, as aforefaid : the fecond is dillribut-
ed to the vas deferens, or trumpet o f the womb, and to the round ligam ent: the third
creeps along the Tides o f the womb,‘infinuating itfelf among the venae hypogaftricae,
with which and the arteries they are joined by anaftomofes: thirdly, the fpermauc
veins receive the hypogaftric arteries as they pafs by the fides o f the uterus, that the
blood m ight be the better elaborated; and they are intermixed with many wonderful
anaftomofes for the preparation o f feed.
T h e tefticles in women differ from thofe in men in thefe follow ing th in gs: i. in
fituation, for thefc are placed within the hypogaftrium , about two inches above the
bottom o f the m atrix, in fuch women as are not with child, being tied bv certain li­
gaments : 2. in m agnitude, for thefe are lefs than the tefticles in men ; for by reafon
o f their heat they are contracted after the woman is fourteen years o f a g e ; whereas,
before that age, they are more large, being full o f a white ju ic e : 3. in their furface,
for thefe are more uneven than thofe o f a m an: 4. in their figure, for thefe are more
broad and flat on the fore and hinder parts; they are alfo more hollow, and fuller o f
fpcrmatic moifture: 5. in their fubftance, being fofter, and, if you take o ff the mem­
brane, you will find them conglomerated or knobbed together o f divers little kernels
or bladders, five or fix, or more, which contain the thick feed : 6. in their membranes
or coats, for, whereas mens have four tunicles, thefe have but one, becaufe they are
in a clofer and warmer place; this finglc coat is called by Galea dartos\ but, where
they receive the fcminal veflels, they are half covered over with the peritonasum : 7.
in their connexion, for they are knit to the Tides o f the uterus by two manifeft paf-
fages, viz. by the rwo upper ligaments, which are loofe and membranous, and out o f
which, in the time o f coition, the feed is c a ft: 8. in their appendices, thefe having no
paraftatje, nor any cremafters; but are ftayed by the broad lateral ligaments, called
the bat’s wings. T h eir ufe is, the fame as in man, to make, elaborate, and perfect,
the feed.

T h e vafa deferential in women, fpring from the lower part o f che tefticles, and are
either inferted with a very fhort pafiage into the bottom o f the wom b; or diffcmi-
nated at the trumpets o f the womb, with fundry exceeding finall fprigs, not much
unlike the vena lattse, arifing from the vafa prsparentia, and continued with them,
though here changing their name and ufe. T heir fubftance is firm, white, and
nervous. T h ey pafs by the membranous ligaments to the matrix, not ftraighr, but
wreathed or twining, with a multitude o f windings; that the fhortnefs o f the way
might be recompenfed by fuch a labyrinth. Near the tefticles they are broad, after­
wards they become narrower, and (mailer, and about the womb they become broad
again, and are inferted into the cornua, and capacity o f it. Their ufe is partly to carry
the feed to the trumpets o f the womb, to be there farther perfeded, and better ela­
borated, and to be kept for u fe: and partly to carry it to the bottom o f the womb,
where another branch runs into the neck, by which way alio the feed is voided,
caufing (by reafon o f the length o f the way) the greater delectation. T h e tuba
fallopiana (fo called from their likenefs to a trumpet o f war) are two in number,
one on each fide, o f a nervous, white, thick, and hard, fubftance; and o f a figure
Tong, round, and hollow. Thefe Spigelius calls vafa cceca, becaufe they have but
one orifice. T hey arife from the bottom o f the wom b, at one end; and, when they
have gone a little therefrom, they grow broader by little and little, crifping them-
felves like the tendrils o f a vine, till they come towards their ends. T hen, difmifling
their wrinkled crifpations, and becoming very broad, chey end in a certain extremity
which feems membranous and flefhy by reafon o f their red colour, and at laft: become
very torn and jagged, having large holes which lie always (hut, thofe jagged ends
ever filling in upon them, which notwithftanding, if they be opened and widened,
repreknt the broad end o f a brazen trumpet. T h ey pafs obliquely from the cornua
over againft the tefticles, being carried by the membranous ligament, and (as ic
were) half com pafsthe tefticles, but are diftane from them every where about half an
inch, they neither proceeding from the ftones nor being inferted into them ; and, as in
their beginnings they are open, fo in their endings they are (hut up and blind, not
reaching to or being inferted into any other part. T h ey are commonly fattened by
very thin membranes, not much unlikethe wings o f bats or flitter-mice,through which
many veins and arteries are dilfeminated from the tefticles into their hollownefies;
by which the feed is conveyed from the tefticles into thefe tu b s or trumpets. Their
infertion at the bottom o f the womb is large, whence fprings a nervous pijie,
ftretched out nearly to the middle o f the trumpet, that by it the feed may be lent
into the bottom o f the w om b: their middle is capacious, with certain little cells or
bladders, containing white feed; after which they are wreathed and crifped: their
32. A a end
90
end is narrower again, and blind as aforefaid. N o w , what the veficefeminales are in
men to preferve the feed, fuch are thele blind paflages in w om en: for they are annex­
ed to the tefticles by the aforefaid little membranes, through which many little veins
pafs, and by which the concocted feed is carried, and here laid up as in a ftore-houfe,
where alfo, by the irradiation o f the virtue o f the teiticles, it is yet better digested,
and made more perfect; from whence, in the time o f coition, it is by the cornua fent
into the cavity o f the womb.
T h e uterus matrix, or womb, is an organical part, the receptacle both o f the feed
and o f the ch ild : and it is fituate in the middle o f the bypogaftrium* called pelvis^ the
bafon, by the os facrum and flank-bones, between the inteftinum return and the
bladder. Its magnitude, even in virgins o f big ftature, exceeds not the bignefs o f a
walnut: but in women with child it dilates itfelf into fuch a capacity as to contain
the child: nature made it at firft fm all, that it m ight embrace the yard, and cherilh
the feed, becaufe it is but little in quantity. Its figure Is faid to refemble a pear:
but the neck thereof refemblts an oblong and round pipe or channel. Its connec­
tion is either by the neck or the bottom : the neck is knit by its ow n fubftance, and
by m em branes; but the bottom by f>eculiar ligaments. O n the fore fide the
neck is joined to the veftca and the ospubis9 by membranes from the peritoneum; on
the hind fide, to the osfacrum and intefiimm return; but about the vulva it grows to­
gether with the anus; on the fides it is loofely joined by membranes to th ^peritoneum.
T he fundus or bottom is not tied by its fubftance, but is free; but in its fides it is
fattened by two pair o f ligaments, which keep the wom b fjfpended or hanging loofe.
T h e upper pair is broad and membranous, which are joined to the os ilium9 and end
in the bottom, near the cornua: they are fofc and loofe, that they may diftend or con­
tract; and by Areteus they a'e likened to the wings o f bats: if thefe ligaments or
mufcles be loofened or broken, by difficult labour or other violence, it may caufe
the falling down o f the womb. T h e two lower ligaments are red like mufcles, and
round like earth-worms, and pervious to the clitoris, from whence, (like a goofe
foot,) deftitute altogether o f their hollownefs, they fpread chemfelves upon the
fore part o f the thigh. Thefe arife from the fides o f the bottom o f the wom b,
touching at their beginning the vafa deferentia; then, attending to the groins, they
pafs through the productions o f the peritoneum and the tendons o f the oblique de­
fendant mufcles o f the belly, and are partly obliterated in the membranesof the bones
near the clitoris, where they are joined, degenerating into a broad nervous thinnefs,
almoft like a goofe foot, as aforefaid; and partly run through the inner part o f the
thigh to the knee; hence it is that women in their firft months going with child
complain o f a pain in the infidc o f their thighs. T h e fubttance o f the womb is
i membranous,
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 3*
membranous, that it may be diftcndcd or contracted as need fliafi iccjuire: it 1$ full
o f wrinkles, which in women impregnated are extended to widen the womb,
which after exclufion o f the child, a$ alio in age, are again contracted. T h e mem­
branes of the womb are two, one common, the other proper. T h e common is
doubled, and grows to the fides on each hand : it arifes from the peritonaeum, and
is exceeding thick, firm, ftrong, fmooth every where except where the ipermatic
vefiels enter or the ligaments go out. T h e proper and internal membrane is
alfo double, between bjth which there are flefhy fibres, fuch as are found in the fto-
mach, with alfo here and there a kind of fpungy fubftance. T he womb has veins
and arteries accompanying one another, which are carried between the tunicles oi
coats thereof, and caft out their blood into its membranous pipes, but not into its
innermoft cavity: thefe vefiels arife both from above and beneath, viz. from theupper
and lower parts o f the body ; for the blood ought to come from the whole body,
that the whole may by the monthly terms be purged, and that, in the time when a
woman is impregnated, the child might be nourifhed. Thofe which defeend from
above run all the womb over, efpecially in the fundus or bottom, being derived from
the fpermatic vefiels, or thofe by which the vafa preparentia are conftituted, as alfo
from the hemorrhoidal branch, whence is the great confent between the womb and
the fpleen: the left ends alfo o f the veins and arteries arejoined with the right ends,
that the right fide may be fupplied with plenty o f blood. Through the arteries (in
women not with child) the menftru&l blood always flow s: wha: is not thus eva­
cuated, returns back again to the heart by the veins, which are joined to the arte­
ries by many anaftomofes. T h e veins and arteries that come from beneath, which
are larger than the former, fpring from the ramus bypogajlricus o f the cava and aorta,
and, running through the neck o f the womb and lower pare o f the bottom, are every
where joined with the fuperior ones by manifold anaftomofes. T h e mouths o f thefe
vefiels enter into the cavity o f the fundus, which, in the time o f the flowing o f the
terms, are opened, and gape, and, becaufe they refemble cups or faucers, are called
acctabuia or cotylidones: to thefe, when a woman is with child, the placenta is joined,
which receives the blood for nourifhment thereof. A n d , becaufe thele branches are
carried to the neck o f the wom b, by them women which are with child fometimes
alfo void their courfes. It is furnifhed with many nerves from the par vagtrn, and
the nerves o f the os facrum, which run to the os uteri and parts about the vulva for
delegation fake, and to the lower parcof thefundus, asalfoto the upper part thereof,
where they are interwoven like a net •, hence arifes the great fympathy between the
womb and the brain. T h e ufe of the womb is to atcraft, receive, retain, preferve,
and cherifh, the feed, inorder to conception : and after conception to contain and
nourilh
nourifh the foetus till the time o f birth. T h e fliort neck o f the wom b, which is its
inner neck, is that which contains the orifice, leading immediately into the cavity o f
the womb » this orifice is a hole not large, but fuch as may admit a probe or large
q jill, and like a mouth may be dilated or purfed in : this entrance is but a tranfverfe
line, which when it is exaftly opened becometh round : this hole after conception is
fo clofcly fhut, that it will not admit the point o f a bodkin ; but at the time o f deli­
very, it opens itfelf wide according to the magnitude o f the infant, be it ever fo
great. T h e cavity o f this neck is rough, arifing from wrinkles, whofe edges tend
inwards, left the feed which has been caff in fhould How out again, as is feen in fuch
barren women as have the Aipperinefs o f the wom b. T h e fundus, or bottom, is the
moft capacious part o f the wom b, feared above the os pubis, that it may be there
diftended. T h e external furface o f the womb is fmooth and even, covered as it
were with a kind o f hum idity: its inner furface is full o f porolities, which are
mouths through which, in time o f a woman’s breeding, blood paffes out o f the vef-
fclso f the wom b, to nourilh the child. W ithin the orifice o f the inner neck grows
a caruncle, which exafbly fhuts the bole*, in which caruncle are to be feen pores
which feem to be at the end of the vafa defereniia, terminating at the neck. T h is
neck o f the wom b is opened in fuperfoetation, in an abortion, in an eje&ion o f a
falfe conception, but efpecially after a wonderful manner at the time o f child-birth,
when it is widened according to them agnitude o f the child : at this (faith Galen) we
n ay wonder, but we cannot underftand it : therefore it is our duty to acknowledge
the wifdom and power o f him that made us. T h e external or greater neck o f the
womb, called fnm pudm s, is a long channel, hollow, (even while the child is in the
wom b,) and fituate between the vulva and internal orifice o f the wom b, being that
pafiage which receives the penis in coition. Its figure is long, (nearly feven inches,)
hollow, (large enough to entertain the penis,) and wrinkled within : but its length
and widenefs are hardly determinable \ fom efay it is as wide as the inteftinum reftum ,
but it is longer or Ihorcer, wider or narrower, according to the luft o f the woman,
the penis being always in coition clofely embraced by it. Its fubftance is a hard and
nervous kind of flefti, and a little fpungy like the yard, wrinkled within (chiefly in
its upper part; rhat it might be occafionally dilated. Laftly, towards rhe middle
or external pait o f this greater neck, in the fore and upper part, near the vulva, is the
infertion o f the bladder into fight, that from thence the urine may be voided by the
meatus urinarius, which is fhortand ftraight, but dilatable; it is without covered with
a flefliy fphin£ter, but within black, and o f the fame fubftance with the urethra in men.
T h e membrane called the hymen is the fign or f.ower o f virginity, becaufe
it can be found in none but virgins; it is called the flower o f virginity from t'he
blood
9 * C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . S3
blood which flows in the firft: aft o f coition. T h at there is fuch a thing is not
to be doubted; it was the legal fign o f a virgin among the ancient Hebrews, as
M ofes has at large declared, Deut. 22. Secondly, it was a received and known thing
in all the eaftern countries, as Leo Africanus affirm s; and the greateft anatomifts
conclude, that in virgins who have ufed no violence to the part, nor have it fretted,
eaten, or broken, by any defluxion o f lharp humours, it is never wanting. W h at
it is, we now come to enquire into: firft, fome fay, it is a tranfverfe membrane, and
they are indeed in the rig h t: but they who would have holes in it, like a ficve, are
deceived. Secondly, others fay, it is a tranfverfe membrane, going acrofs the neck
o f the womb, a little above the neck o f the bladder, which ref.fts the firft entrance
o f the penis. Thirdly, Sebizius faith, that if this membrane isabfent, we muft reft
in the ftraightnefs o f the neck and other m arks, which being widened in the firft
coition, pain and effufion o f blood follow, by reafon o f the folution o f the continuity.
Fourthly, Severinus Pinaeus (whofe opinion is the neweft o f all) faith, that the four
myrtle-fbaped caruncles, tied together by a fmall membrane, placed in the outer
part of the neck o f the womb, is the true hymen fo much fough; after; and without
doubt Pinseus is in the right: to this Bauhinus agrees; and Bartholinus faith, that
he could find no other in a young girl carefully diflefted. It is fituate in the neck
o f the womb, ju ft behind the infertion o f the neck o f the bladder, or a little more
inwards: but its fituation does now and then vary a little: there this membrane
goes acrofs the cavity, much like the diaphragma, or midriff. A s to its figure,
it has an hole in its middle, big enough to receive a pea, by which the menftrual
blood paffes: if it be without any hole, fo that thecourfes cannot flow, thence
come difeafes, and f if it be not opened) at laft death. It is connefted orbicularly
to the neck o f the womb, as if it grew out o f the fame, where it is thicker
than in the m iddle: its fubftance is partly membranous, partly flefhy, yet not
very th ick : it is interlaced with many little veins, which being broken in the
firft coition, pain and bloodfhed follow, even as they do in fome men, where the
frsnum or bridle o f the penis (being exceeding fhort and ftraight) is torn or rent
afunder. Its ufe is to defend the internal parts from injury; as alfo to be the fign o f
virginity.
T h e vulva is the external privity, which is that which offers itfelf to fight before
diffeftion, being located under the fore-region o f the os pubis. T h e more principal
internal parts are the wrinkled chinks, the four myrtle-fhaped caruncles, the orifice
o f the urinal paffage; and the clitoris: the more external parts are the wings, the
lips, the great chink, and the pubes, or hairy part. T h e wrinkled and inward chink,
is the immediate mouth o f the larger neck o f the womb, lying behind the myrtle-
32. B b fhaped
fliaped caruncles: it is o f a reafonable largenefs, and framed by nature to ftay the
feed caft into the neck from too qu ickly Hipping out. T h e myrtle-lhaped carun­
cles, are placed fo as to appear in a quadrangular form , one at each corner: one o f
them is placed before or above in the circumference o f the hole o f the urinary paflage
tc fhut the fame, it being largeft and forked, that it might receive the end o f the
ir.eacus urinarius, and hinder external things from entering: the fecond is oppofue
to the former, and is fituate below : the two remaining ones are placed collaterally:
their figure refembles a m yrde-berry: their magnitude is various in different fub-
jtiSls ; their fubftance is framed o f the reduplication o f the fle(hy neck o f the womb,
being partly flefiiy, partly membranous: they are connected with membranes or
valves: their ufes are for ticillation in the time o f coition, and alfo immediately to
lhut the orifice o f the neck, that air, duft, nor any other matter, may enter. T h e
orifice o f the urinal paffage, is a hole under the clitoris above the n eck; through
this women make water, and it feems to be fhut with a kind o f flelhy valve. T h e
clitoris, called by fome nympha, by others, lentigo, by others the woman’s yard, be-
caufe ic refembles a man’s yard in figure, fubftance, compofition, repletion with fpi-
rits, erection, and fituation. Its figure is fomewhat like the glans and praeputium
c f the penis; but it is commonly fm all, being feated in the middle o f the os pubis in
the upper and former end o f the foffa magna, where the alas or nymphre m eet; but in
its beginning for the moft part it lies hid under thenymphse, and afterwards (ticks
out a little. Its fubftance is like that o f a man’s yard, confifting o f two nervous bodies,
hard and thick, but within full o f a black fpungious matter, as in the lateral liga­
ments o f the yard. T h e two lateral ligaments arife from the internal knob o f the
ifehium : the third is between thefe, fpringing from the joining o f the os pubis. Its
mufcles are the fame in na:ure and number with thofe in a man. Its extremity is
the glans, which hath a fuperficial hollownefs, but not bored through; this is co­
vered with a very thin (kin as a prepucium, which fprings from the joining o f the
nymphae. It has veins and arteries, common to it and the privity, and a nerve from
the par vagum , larger than its body m ight feem to require, to give it an exquifite
fenfe, and caufe ereftion. In this is the feat o f delegation and luff. T h e ale or
nymphay commonly called wings, appear when the two lips are fevered, being two
productions made o f a foft and fpungy fiefh, and the reduplication o f the cutis, and
Htuated at the (ides o f the neck between the two lips: being joined above, they compafs
the clitoris: they arc in number tw o; in colour red like cock’s g ills; in figure almoft
triangular, but m uch refcmble a cock’s co m b ; in fubftance partly membranous,
partly flefhy. T h eir ufe is the fame with the caruncles, as alfo to convey the urine
ftraight out, that it might not wet the Ups. T h e labia,or lips, are two in number, by
which
94 C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 95
which the internal parts are covered: they are conftituted to the common teguments
o f the body, and a great deal o f fpungious fa t: the lower joinings o f thefe lips is
in virgins fomewhat ftraight, and feem o f a ligamentous fubftance for firmnefs, buc
in married women it is loofe, and in fuch as have had a child ftill loofer. T h e fojfa
or riantm
a%na^ begins at the os pubis, and is not much above a.i inchdiftant from
the anus, which being much larger than the inner chink, or cavity o f the neck o f
the womb, this is feen as foon as ever the lips are drawn aflde: in this fofla the lips
btingopened, two holes appear, (but lcarcely vifible,) out o f which a whiciih or
wheyiffi juice iflues, In this fofla, are alfo two collateral chinks, the right and left,
which are between the lips and the wings. T h zpubes> called alfo monticuli veneris,
in the part where the hair grows, and is properly termed the privity*, being longilh
hillocks, foft, and o f a fubftance the like whereof is not to be found again in the
whole body, being partly fkin, partly fpungy flefti, placed upon a portion o f hard fat;
The membranes infolding the child in the womb, are the firlt things which are
bred in the womb after conception, to defend the more excellent part o f the feed:
their efficient caufe is theformativefaculty, joined with the heat o f the womb : thefe
in human kind are in number only two, viz. the amniosand the chorion^to which latter
belongs the placenta or womb-cake. A ll thefe together make that which w ecall
fecundine, or after-birth. It is fo called, becaufe it is the fecond habitation o f the
child next the w om b; and alfo becaufe it comes away by a fecond birth, afterthe child
or firft birth, dmnios (from its foftnefs and thinnefs) is the firft membrane, it is the
thinneft o f the tunicles, white, foft, tranfparent, and furnifhed with fome few fmall
veins and arteries, which are difperled within its foldings. It compafles the child im­
mediately, and cleaves almoft every where to the chorion, efpecially at the ends *
, and
is united in the middle thereof, about the placenta, where the vafa umbilicalia come
forth, but it is eafily Separated from the chorion. It contains within it plenty o f
humidity and humours, in which the child does as it werefwim, that fo, i. the child
floating therein, may be the higher, and lefs. burthenfome to the mother. 2. T h at
the child may not ftrikeagainft any o f the neighbouring hard parts. 3. T h a t the
membranes being broke, and this humour running out at time o f birth, makes the
child's way, through the neck, o f the wom b,fm ooth, flippery, andeafy. T h is humour,
thus falling, is what midwives call the breaking o f the water. P a r tc f the amnios
does row and then hang about the head o f the child, and then the infant is faid to
be born wich a c a u l: fome take this for a prefageof good, fome of evil, fome o f fliort
life, fome o f long,, but it has relation to none o f thefe things, for it has been found on
the heads of both happy and miferable, and o f both fhorc and long lived, perfons.
Cbsrica is the fecond membrane, and compafles the child like a circle: this imme­
diately
diatcly compafles the former, and lies beneath it, whofe inner and hollow part it
isvelopes, extending itfelf according to the magnitude thereof: it is with fome dif­
ficulty feparated from the amnios, and ftrongly bears and unites the veffels to the
placenta. T h at Ode next to the child is fmooth and (lippery ; the other Ode is fixed
immediately to the wom b by the faid placenta, which is commonly on theupper and
fore fide: it does notencompafs the whole child, being conftituted o f an innumera­
ble company o f veins and arteries, between which, blood out o f the veffels feem to be
Ihed. T h e placenta uterr>or wom b-cake, (becaufe o f its fhape,) is a round mafs o f
flefh, furniflied with divers veffels, through which the ch id receives its nutriment.
Its fubftance feems to be conftituted o f an infinite number o f little fibres, with con­
gealed blood interpofed. It has veins and arteries runninq through it from the um ­
bilical veffels, which are at length loft: about the edges o f the placenta, m aking won­
derful contextures, and clofely knit to the fubftance thereof, being joined together
by various anaftomofes, through which the blood in the child runs back out o f the
arteries into the veins. It is, firft, to be a fupport to the navel veffels under which
it lie s: fecondly, to prepare blood to nourilh the child, as the true liver does in
grown perfons. T h is blood it fucks out o f the veins o f the wom b, and, preparing
it for ufe, fends it through the greater umbilical vein to the liver o f the child, that
fo it may be carried to the heart, out o f which it is fent by the arteries into the
whole body o f the child for nourilhment.
T h e um bilical or navel veflels, (fo called bccaufc, the child being excluded, they
are all found to centre in its navel,) are in number four, v iz. one vein, two arte­
ries, and the urachus\ all which are covered with one common membrane or coat,
which both inclofes all thole veflels, and diftinguilhes them one from another, that
they m ight neither be entangled or broken. T h e navel vein, pafling through the
two coats o f the peritonaeum, is inferted into the liver by a cleft, going through the
navel, fometimes Angle and fometimes double. It is about five feet and a half in
length, being meafured to the placenta: it is varioully rolled or twifted about, that
its length m ight not prove troublefom e: from the navel it goes over the breaft,
from whence it is obliquely carried over the right and left fides o f the throat and
neck, turning itfelf back at the hinder part o f the head, and fo over the middle o f
the forehead to the placenta: fometimes alfo it encompaffes the neck like a chain,
all which you are to underfland o f the whole cord or navel-ftring, with the reft o f
the veffels contained therein. Its ufe is to convey the maternal blood from the pla­
centa, through the navtl, to the child, for its nourifhment. In this navel-ftring
there are knots tranfparent in the veins, but not in the arteries, which are nothing
but am ore thick and flcfhy conftitution o f the membrana carnofa in thofe parts:
2 from
gS C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 97
from the number o f thefe knots midwives pretend to foretel how many children a
woman fhall have; but thefe are vain divinations, for there is often more knots in
the navel o f the laft child than o f the firft. It is about five feet and a half or fix
feet long, and about the thicknefs o f a man’s finger: when it is dry it becomes fmal-
ler, and is kept as a precious thing to haften the birth in other perfons. T h e child
being born, this navel-ftring muft be tied with a ftrong thread wound often about,
the diftance o f two or three inches from the belly o f the infant, and about three in­
ches from the binding it muft be cut ofF: afterwards the navel is to be carefully
looked to till it is dry, and falls o ff o f its own accord. Thefe veflels, after the child
is born, do, within the abdomen, degenerate into ligaments : the vein to a ligament
o f the liver, and the arteries into lateral ligaments o f the bladder, becaufe their ule
is now abolifhed, there being no longer any paflage o f the mother’s blood. T h e
urachus is a little cord or ligament, by which the bladder is fuftained and faftened to
to the peritonaeum, that, being difbnded with ur:ne, its neck might not be compref-
fed, which thing alfo is done by the arteries. Hence it appears, that the urine o f
a child in the womb is certainly voided by its yard into the membrane amnios,
(whence it is that it is fo full o f water,) a great part o f it yet remaining in the blad­
der, which is the caufe that always new-born children are for the firft days continu­
ally making water. If the urine were not in part thus voided, the bladder would
not only beover-ftretched, but broken.

whereas in beads it is fomewhat (harp, fo that m ankind only lies on the back. Its
Jubilance is partly boney, partly flefhy; boney, becaufe it contains not any parts much
to be didended; flefhy, becaufe it contains parts which ought to be m oved, as the
heart and lungs.
T h e breads, or dugs, are common to both fexes; in men they are framed o f the
catis, the membrana carnofa, fat, and the nipple, and are called mammilla. T h e
dugs in women have befides many remarkable veffels, glandules, and pipes, to make
and contain m ilk. T h e nipple or teat, called papilla, is fpungy, like theglans o f a
man’s yard, and perforated through the middle with many fmall holes for the m ilk
to pafs through. It is rougher than the other parts, that the infant may the more
firmly hold it, and o f an exquifue fenfe, that the nurfe (hould find pleafure when (lie
gives fu ck: round about it there is a circle, called areola; in virgins it is pale and
knotty; in nurds, brow n; and in old women, black. T h e veins are two-fold, viz.
external and internal: the external arife from the axillary, and are placed under the
(kin which moves the dugs, and are called thoracic# fyperiores, the upper breaft-
\eins: thefe, in women with child and fuch as give fuck, are often feen very
blue. T h e internal arife or defeend from the trunk o f the axillary vein, or ramus
lu b ch v iu s; and are called mammar'ue vena, or du g-vein s: thefe are met by other af-
cendant veins from the womb, and therefore, the child being born, the blood is
carried no longer to the womb, but to the breads; and hence it is that women
which give (uck leldom have their courfes. H o w m ilk is generated and made, the
opinions o f men arc various: l'ome think it to be made o f the venal blood, but they
are abfolutely deceived : fomc think it to be made only o f arterial blood, and thefe

err alfo from the truth: others fay, it is made o f blood and ch yle: but our opinion
is, that it proceeds from, and is generated of, the chylous juice, and a ferous part o f
the arterial blood: for that the ferofity o f the arterial blood (and not the fubftance
o f the blood itfelf) docs help to generate andconftitute the m ilk, we are induced to
believe, not only from the foregoing reafon, but becaufe no anaftomofes o f the arte­
ries with the latteal pipes o f the dugs could ever yet be found o u t: and truly this
opinion Bartholine feems to favour, where he faith, that ail the blood which is pour­
ed out o f the arteries into the breafts, is not turned into m ilk, but only themore fe­
rous or wheyifh part thereof; the reft (that which ferves for nourilhment excepted)
running back again, by the veins into the heart.
T h e membrane, called pleura, or inner covering o f the ribs, is a membrane white
thin, hard, and refemblingthe peritonaeum, but thicker and ftronger. It arifesfrom
the tur.ides which cover the intercoftal nerves proceeding from the back-bone, by
means o f which it is continued wkh the coats o f the brain: and therefore it is
thicker in the back, to whofe vertebras it cleaves as it were infeparabty. It is every
where double, that the veflels may be carried within the foldings thereof: the in­
ner parr, looking towards the lungs and inwards, is thickeft, fmootheft, and as it
•were bedewed with a waterifh humour, that it fhould not hurt the lungs by any
roughnefs; the outer part is thinner and rougher, that it might cleave the more
firmly to the rib s: between thefe the matter o f the pleurify is many times colle&ed,
and not only between the pleura and mufcles. A s to its figure, it is arched without,
hollow w ithin; above it is narrower, below broader, principally towards the fides.
From it arife fome nervous fibres, by which the lungs are tied to i t ; if thefe be too
ftraight, the motion o f the lungs is hindered, which caufes an incurable difficulty o f
breathing. Its ufes arc to cover the whole cavity o f the thorax, and render it fmooth,
that the lungs might not be hurt; and to wrap in all the vital parts, and to defend
them from all externa! injuries. T h e mediafiiaumis a membrane Handing in the mid­
dle o f the breaft, dividing the right fide from the left. It ariles from the pleura, be­
ing a double membrane. Its fubftance is membranous, yet fofter than the pleura;
its exterior part is rougher, becaufe o f the fibres, by which it is knit to the pleura -
y
but its inner fide, towards the lungs, is fm ooth; and about the veflels it is common­
ly full o f fat like the caul. T h e ufes o f the mediaftinum are, firft, to divide the
thorax into two parts, that, the breaft and lungs being hurt or wounded on one fide,
the other might be fa fe : fecondly, to hold up the pericardium firmly, wherein the
heart is contained, that it fhould not reft upon the back-bone, when we lie upon our
b a ck ; or, that it fhould fall upon the breaft-bone, when we bendourfelves towards
the ground ; nor touch the ribs, when we lie upon our fides: thirdly, to give a fate
paffage to the veflels which run through it ■, as alfo to fuftam the midrift', left it
fhould. by the weight o f the bowels, be drawn too much downwards. T h e
T \\zpericardium, or cvfiis o f the heart, is a membrane encompaffing the whole
heart, whole pyramidal figure it hath. It is fo far diftant from the heart as is tafli-
cient to give way for the motion o f the fame, and to contain the waterilh humour*
It has two membranes, one exterior from the mediaftinum, tied before and behind to
the pkurayand is fibrous; and one interior, from the external tunicles o f the vefiels
o f the heart; for within the pericardium, the vefiels want their common tunicle, it
having been fpent upon the pericardium. Theoriginal therefore o f the pericardium
is at the bafis from the tunicles which compafs the vefiels o f the heart, which pro­
ceed from the pleura. It is connected circularly to the mediaftinum, and the neigh­
bouring parts, with many fibres; but efpecially to the nervous circle o f the dia-
phragma, to which it cleaves lo exceeding faft, that it cannot be feparated from it
without rending; whereby the motion o f the heart is directed. W ithin this pericar­
dium (befides the heart) is contained a ferous or watery humour, tranfparently clear,
and in fome like water wherein flelh has been w alhed: in tafte it is neither fharp,
fait, nor acid. It proceeds out o f the vefiels o f the heart, being a watery part o f
the blood, as lym pha, and other juices, which go to their proper receptacles. T h e
' ufe o f this ju ice is to cool and moiften the heart, and to make it flippery, thereby to
facilitate its m otion: alfo, that the heart, by fwim m ing therein, may be lefs ponde­
rous, and not ftrike againft any part. T h ofe who have this humour confum edhave
their hearts dry ; if it be in too great a quantity, it raufes a palpitation o f the heart,
and fuffocation, and death follows therefrom ; if it be quite contained, acontam p-
tion o f the body happens.
T h e heart is a mufcular body, included in the pericardium and fituated nearly in
the middle o f the breaft, between the lobes o f the lungs *
, being the primary organ o f
the circulation o f the blood, and confequently o f life. Its figure is nearly conic,
the larger end being called its bafe, and the (mailer end its apex. Its lower part is
plane, and the upper part convex. Its fituation is nearly tranfverfe, or horizontal;
fo that its bafe is in the right, and its apex, with the greateft part o f its bu lk, is in
the left, fide o f the th o rax; and confequently it is there that the pulfation is felt.
The plane furfacc o f the heart lies on the diaphragm * the convex one is turned up­
wards. T h e heart is connected, ift, by the intervention o f the pericardium with the
nudiaftiiium, and w itha large part o f them iddle o f the diaphragm ; this is contrived
by nature, to prevent its being difplaced, inverted, or turned too rudely about,
in confcquence o f the various motions o f the body. 2. Its bafe is connected to its
common vefiels • but its apex is free, and is received in a kind o f cavity in the left
lobe o f the lungs. T h e length o f the human heart is about fix fingers breadth;
its breadth at the bafe is about five fingers; and its circumference about thirteen.

It is, both externally and internally, furrounded with a ftnooth membrane. There
is a quantity o f fat about it, which covers its bale and its apex, and fe rn s for lu­
bricating it, and for facilitating its motion. Its blood-veffels are o f two kinds,
common and proper j its common or peculiar vefiels being the coronary arteries
and veins. T h e common vefiels o f the heart are two veins, called the vena cava>
and the venapahnonalis; and two arteries, the pulmonary one and aorta. T h e nerves
o f the heart are fmall, and arife from the par vagum and intercoftals: the auricles are
two. There are alfo two cavities in the heart, called its ventricles: o f thefe the
right is thinner and weaker in its circumference, but ufually much more capacious,
than the le ft: it receives the blood from the vena cava and the right auricle, and
delivers it into the pulmonary artery, to be carried to the lungs. T h e left ventricle
is much ftronger and thicker in its Tides; but it is narrower and fmaller than the
rig h t: it receives the blood from the pulmonary vein, and the left auricle, and ex­
trudes it very forcibly into the aorta. T h e right ventricle is in the anterior part o f
the thorax; fo that they might be called the anterior and pofterior ventricles, m uch
more properly than the right and left. There are in the Tides of both the ventricles
o f the heart, and o f both its auricles, feverat column* earner or lacertuliy with fur­
rows between them, feeming fo many fmall and diftintt m ufcles; and, from the
concourfe o f the tend:nous fibres o f thefe in the heart, there are formed peculiar
membranes ficuated at the orifices o f the auricles o f the hear:: and there are alio
other columns o f this kind, which run tranfverfely from one fide o f the ventricles
to the other: thefe ferve partly to affift the contraction o f the heart in its l'yftole,
and partly to prevent its too great dilatation in its diaftole. T h e vahttU o f the
heart are o f three kinds, i. T h e tricufpidales *
, thefe are three in number, and are
ficuated at the ingrefs o f the vena cava in the right ventricle. 2. T h e mitrales;
thefe are two, and are (ituated in the left ventricle at the ingrefs o f the pulmonary'
v e in : thefe ferve to hinder the ingrefs o f the blood from the heart into the veins
again, while they are confirm ed. 3. T h e femilunar ones •, thefe are three, and are
fituated at the organ o f the aorta and pulmonary artery, and ferve to prevent the
reflux o f the blood from them into the heart: thefe, for the fake o f ftrength, are
furnifhed with a number o f flefhy fibres and fpheroidal corpufcles. T h e orifices of
the veins o f Thebefius and Verheyen, in the hollows o f the heart, are for carrying back
the blood from the fubftance o f the heart to its cavities. T h e fibres o f the heart
are o f a mufcular fubftance, and o f a moft amazing fabric. They are o f two kinds,
1. ftraight ones in the lefc ventricle; and, 2. fpiral ones, common to both ventricles,
and o f two orders. T h e exterior ones run to the left, from the bafe o f the heart:
the interior ones run to the right, and interfcCt the others *
, and, when they aCt,
they clofely conftringe the cavities o f the heart, and drive out the blood from them.
33. D d According
A ccording to this fabric, the heart may be refolved into two m ufcles, each o f which
conftitutes one o f its ventricles. T h e ufe o f the heart is for the circulation o f the
b lo od : it receives the blood from the veins, running from all parts of the b o d y;
and propels it again, by its own motion, to all thofe parts, through the arteries. O n
this depend life itfclf, the prefervation o f the frame, and the motions and altions o f
all its parts. B ut, that the reader may have as diftinft an idea as poflible o f this pri­
mary organ o f life, we (hall lay before him feveral views o f it in the plate annexed ;
where N o. i. reprefents the human heart feen in its convex part, and in its natural
fituation; B marks the branches o f the coronary vein ; C , the coronary artery;
D , the right auricle; E , branches o f veins going from the right auricle; G , the
trunk o f the aorta; H , the trunk o f the pulmonary artery; I, the afeending trunk
o f the vena c a v a ; L , L , & c . branches o f the aorta, rifing upwards; one o f the
branches o f the pulmonary ar:ery; N , N , & c . branches o f the pulmonary vein.
N o . %. reprefents the heart opened, to (hew the ftru&ure and form o f its ventricles;
where A exprefles the mufcular feptum , or partition, which divides the ventricles;
B , the right ventricle opening into the right auricle, and into the trunk o f the pul­
monary artery; C , the left ventricle, opening into the left auricle, and into the great
trunk o f the aorta. N o. 3. and N o. 4. reprefent the heart in different pofitions;
where A marks the afeending trunk o f the vena ca va ; B, the trunk o f the aorta;
C , branches o f the pulmonary v e in ; D , the defeending trunk o f the vena ca v a ;
and E , part o f tire right auricle, cu t away, to (hew the different arrangement o f the
internal fibres and venous dulls.
T h e lungs, or lights, are the inftruments o f breathing, and are the largeff vifeus
o f the thorax : they are ficuated in the two ffdes o f it, with the heart, as it were, be­
tween them : and are connected, by means o f the mediaftinum, with the fternum and
vertebrae; with the heart, by means o f the pulmonary veflels, and immediately
with the afpera arteria. T h e colour o f the lungs, in infants, is a fine florid red ; in
adults, it is darker; and in old people, livid, or variegated, with black and white.
W hen inflated, they have fome refemblance to the hoof o f an o x » and are convex
on the upper fide, and concave underneath. T h e y are divided into two large lobes,
the light and le ft; the left, which is the fmallcr, is divided again into tw o ; and
the right, which is larger, into three fmall ones. T h e membrane with which the
lungs are furrounded is continuous with the pleura. T h e fubitance o f the lungs is
Ipungeous, or veficulous, and they feem, indeed, entirely compofed o f a number o f
lmall vdicles o f a fleftiy texture, and o f a variety o f veflels. T h e veflels o f the
lungs are the bronchia, the bronchial artery and vein, the nerves, and the lymphatics.
T h e ufes o f the lungs are, 1. T o perform the office o f refpiration, by which the
blood is attenuated in the plexus o f the arteries called the rete vafculofum* 2. T o be

T H E origin o f the blood is in the chyle, which, palling the lafteals, is delivered
into the fubclavian ; where, mixing with the blood, they proceed together to the
right ventricle o f the heart \ and there, being yet more intimately mixed, they cir­
culate together through the whole body: till, after levcral circulations, and fecre-
tions at the fcveral drainers o f the body, they are afllmilated, fo as to make one uni­
form compound mafs, which appears to be nothing elfe but chyle altered by the
artifice o f nature, and exalted into blood ; there being no appearance o f any thing
extraneous mixed with the liquor circulating in the blood-veffels, but ch yle; ex­
cepting what had been before feparated from it, for lome particular purpofes, which
being once ferved, it is returned to it again: unlefs, perhaps, it may receive fome
portion o f air in the lungs.
T he blood, while in its vefiels, appears to the naked eye uniform and homoge­
neous; but, when let out and cold, it (eparates fpontaneoully into two different parts,
the one red and fibrous, which coheres into a mafs, and is called the cruor; the other
thin and tranfparent, which retains fluidity when cold, and, being fuppofed fpe-
cifically heavier than the other, fuftains and bears it up, and is called the firum. I f
the red part o f the blood bears too great a proportion to the ferum, which is the cafe
o f athletic perfons, and others who do not take a fufficient quantity o f drink with
their meat, the fault may be corrected by leffening the meat, or by increafing their
drink. In the beginning o f fevers, the proportion o f the red par: o f the blood to the
ferum is greater, and at the end o f them lefs, than it is in health. T h e change o f this
proportion is owing to perfons under this diforder living wholly on drink and liquid
nourifhment; and bodies loaded with ferous moifture, being an argument o f too
fmall a proportion o f the red part of the blood to the ferum, have been freed from
their load by abftaining wholly from drink. There are other cacfes befides the bare
quantities o f meat and drink, which vary the proportion o f the red part o f the blood
to the ferum; for this proportion is greater in country-people than in citizens, in
perfons who ufe exercife than in perfons who are inactive, and in perfons who live
upon flefh meats and fermented liquors than in perfons who live upon vegetables
and water. In fhort, this proportion is increafed by things which dry the body and
ftrengthen the fibres; and leffened by things o f a contrary nature. T o o great a pro­
portion o f the red part o f the blood to the ferum renders bodies fubjett to inflam­
matory
J04
marory fevers on taking cold. T h e blood is found to confift chiefly o f phlegm, as
the bafisor veh icle; for, from the beft experiments it appears, that in feven ounces
o f human blood, there are five ounces two drachms o f phlegm, three drachms o f a
fubtile fpirituous oil, a fmall quantity o f a thicker oil, two drachms o f fait, and about
two o f earth. From thefe conftituent parts o f the blood, varioufly combined and
diftributed by the circulatory motion imprefled by the heart, and by the ofcillatory
expanfive motion o f the interfperfed air, and the re-aCtion o f the contraCUle veflels,
flew all the properties and operations o f the blood. From this m ixture o f elements,
and their lax compofition, it becomes fufceptible o f various alterations and impref-
fion$; the principal whereof are, coagulation, which ufually attends it out o f the
body, fonictiincs in it, and fcaice ever without an attificial procurement, but always
mortal: and difiblution, which is ju ft oppofite to the former, and confifts in fuch a
com m unitionofthe fibrous parts o f the blood as indifpofes it for a reparation o f the
cruor from the ferum. T h is is frequently the confequence o f malignant and pefti-
lential fevers, & c. and is likewife occafioned by fome kinds o f poifons.
T h e circulation o f the vital blood is performed through the arteries: and its courfe
is from the heart towards the extremes o f the body: and this from every part o f
the body, internal and external $ ftill out o f a wider part into a narrower, out o f the
trunk into the branches. A nd it is on this principle alone, that all the blood
may be derived into an artery, and evacuated at it. F or it is evident, that all the
arteries o f the body are continually bringing the blood from the left part o f the
heart, through the trunks o f the arteries, into the branches; and on the contrary,
that all the veins, excepting the porta, are perpetually bringing back the blood from
the extreme parts into the heart. T h e blood being arrived here, its motion or cir­
culation is continued as follows. T h e auricles o f the heart, being large hollow muf-
cles, are furnifhed with a double feries o f ftrong fibres proceeding with a contrary
direftion to two oppofite tendons, the one adhering to the right ventricle, the other
to the finus venofus: as alfo with innumerable veins and arteries*, by the contractile
force o f thefe auricles, the blood is vigoroufly exprefled, and driven into the right
ventricle; which, upon this contraction, is rendered flaccid, em pty, and difpofed
to admit it. If now the right ventricle, thus full o f blood, by the contraction o f
its fibres prefs the blood towards the aperture again, venous blood, at the fame time
pouring in, will drive it back again into the cavity and mix it more intim ately; till
rifingup againft the parietes, it raifes the valvulae tricufpides, which are fo connect­
ed to the flcfhy columns extended on the oppofite fide, as that when laid quite down
they cannot d o le the parietes o f the right ventricle: thefe it thrufts towards the right
auricle, till being there joined they flop the pafiage very clofely, and prevent any
return. B y the fame means the fame blood riles up into the three femilunar valves,
2 placed
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 105
placed in the extremity o f the other mouth, and lying open to :he pulmonary ar­
tery : thele it ihuts clofe againft the fides o f the artery, and leaves a palTage into the
artery alone. T h e venous blood, therefore, that is, the blood o f the whole body,
continually moves out o f thefinus, or trunk o f the vena cava, through the right au­
ricle and right ventricle, into the pulmonary artery, in a continued and forcible
ftream. T h e blood carried by this artery into the lungs, and diftributed by its
branches through the whole fubftance thereof, is firft admitted into the extremities
o f the pulmonary vein, called arteriavenofa\ whence, palling into four large veflcls,
which unite together, it is brought to the leftfinus venofus, or trunk o f the pulmonary
vein ; by the force o f whofe mufculous ftru&ure it is driven into the left ventricle,
which on this occafion is relaxed, and by that means prepared to receive it. Hence,
as before, it is driven into the left ventricle, which is relaxed by the fame means;
and the valvula mitraks opening, admit it into the left ventricle, and hinder its re­
flux into the pulmonary vein. From hence it is forced into the aorta ; at whofe
orifice there are three femilunar valves, which alfo prevent a reflux by dolin g the
fame. A^d thus is circulation effected; all the blood fent into the lungs, and re­
ceived in the arteria venofa, finus venofus, left auricle and ventricle, being here con­
tinually propelled into the aorta, whofe ramifications are fpread throughout all the
reft o f the body, with a violent motion. T hu s is all the blood, in its return from
every part o f the body, internal and external, and from every part o f the heart and
its auricles, impelled into the right ventricle; out o f that into the lungs; thence
into the left ventricle, and thcncc through the whole extent o f the body; and thence
again brought back to the heart.
In a fa tus, the apparatus for the circulation is fomewhat different from that
above cefcribed. T h e feptum which feparates the two auricles o f the heart, is
pierced through with an aperture, called the foramen ovale; and the trunk o f the
pulmonary artery, a little after it has left the hearr, (ends out a tube in the defending
aorta, called the communicating canal. T h e blood in the lungs o f the foetus has
none o f the advantages o f air or r e fla tio n ; which yet being neceffary, nature, it
is fuppofed, takes care that it receives a portion o f air, mixed together with its mo­
ther’s blood, and tranfmitted to it by the umbilical veffels, to be diffufed through
the body. T his is confirmed hence; that, by conftringing the navel-ftring very
tight, the child dies like a man ftrangled; which appears to be owing to nothing
but the want o f air. A d d to this, that, as foon as the mother ceafes to refpire, the
foetus expires.
A s tc the velocity o f the circulating blood, and the time wherein the circulation
is completed, feveral computations have been made. B y D r. Keill’s account, the
blood is driven out o f the heart into the aorta, with a velocity which would carry it
33' E e fifty-two
fifty-two feet in a m inute; but this velocity is continually abated in the progFefs o f
the blood through the numerous feCtions, or branches, o f the arteries *
, fo that before
it arrives at the extremities o f the body, its motion is infinitely diminifhed* T h e
fpace o f time wherein the whole mafs o f blood may ordinarily circulate, is varioufly
determined. Some o f the iateft writers ftate it th u s: fuppofing the heart to make
aoo pulfes in an hour, and that at every pulfe there is expelled an ounce o f blood ;
as the whole mafs is not ordinarily computed to exceed 24 pounds, it muft be cir­
culated feven or eight times over in the fpace o f an hour. T h e impetus, occafioning
the circulation, is great enough in fome animals to raile the blood fix, feven, or
eight, feet high from the orifice it fpins out at *
, which, however, is far exceeded by
that o f the fap o f a vine in bleeding-time, which will fometimes rife upwards o f
forty feet high. T h e heat and motion o f the blood are always greater, from a greater
a&ivity in the foul, in the day than in the n igh t; and they are likewife ever greater
from the food taken in the day-time, for the pulfe is always quicker after eating
than before i t ; after a full neal than after a fpare one; and after a meal o f drier
and ftronger food, than after a meal o f food that is moifter and weaker.
O r t i i e P U L S E S .
T H E pulfe is that reciprocal motion o f the heart and arteries, whereby the warm
blood, thrown out o f the left ventricle o f the heart, is fo impelled into the arteries,
and fo diftributed throughout the whole body, as to be perceived by the finger. It
is certain, that life, health, and the due order o f the whole body, depend upon a
proper and equable circulation o f the blood and humours through the folid parts;
fo that, the better regulated and the more equable the circulation is, the more per­
fectly nature preferves herfclf, and cures the difeafes incident to h er; and, on the
contrary, the more this circulation recedes from a due and equable ftate, the weaker
nature is found to be, and the more fubjeCt to misfortunes and difeafes. N ow every
one m uft own, that the circulation o f the blood cannot be better inveftigated than
by feeling the pulfe, not in a fuperficial manner, but for a fuflicient tim e: for the
pulfe not only difeovers the imperfections and ftrength o f the whole body, but alfo
the nature o f the hinod, and ftate o f the various fecrerions. A n d , as a pendulum o f
a clock, by its equable and regular vibrations, manifefts the worth o f the clock, fo
the pulfe difeovers the habit o f the patient, and the vigour or deprivation o f all
the functions.
A moderate, conftant, and equal, pulfe, is the rule anc nieafure by which we are to
judge o f the reft. A moderate pulfe, is that which is large, but neither qu ick nor
flow, hard nor equal: this is the pulfe with which all others ought to be com ­
pared, and which denotes the beft ftate o f health, the abfcnce o f all preternatural

and fcreign things, and a due and temperate degree o f heat: for, when fuch a pulfe
is prefcnr, the fluids are duly fpiricuous, the fibres poflefled of their natural tone,
the blood temperate and fluid, and confequently the tranfpiration free, the nutrition
good, the animal funAions vigorous, the fecrctions duly carried on, and the patient
in a ftate o f good health. But, when the pulfe is quicker, and confequently more
frequent than ufual, it indicates a preternatural irritation o f the heart, as the ancients
exprefs it, unlefs it proceeds from external caufes. But, if fuch a pulfe continues
long, it infallibly denotes a diforder accompanied with an incrcafe, and even a fever.
It is generally produced by an inteftine motion o f the blood, and a change induced
on the crafis o f the fpirits, by an admixture o f heterogeneous and often cauftic par­
ticles. W hen the pulfe is vehement, and at the fame time quick, it indicates a fe-
verifli intemperature, an admixture o f fomething heterogeneous with the blood,
lymph, and fpirits; but at the fame time a large quantity o f health and fpirits. I f a
vehement and quick pulfe is alfo large, the circulation o f the blood is brilk, the heat
and thirft great, and the whole habit red and turgid. W here the pulfe is fmall, and
little blood is conveyed from the heart to the arteries, and from the veins to the heart,
the circulation o f the blood is faint and languid. Hence the tranfpiration and fecre-
tionsarebut fmall, and the ftrength little: but, if a fmall pulfe is at the fame time weak,
frequent, and quick, it denotes a great languor o f the ftrength, a preternatural in­
teftine motion, and a weak circulation o f the blood ; and, if this fpecies o f pulle
continues long, it indicates malignity and great danger.
A flow pulfe generally denotes a vifeidity, thicknefs, and weak circulation, o f the
blood, together with a languor o f the fecrecions» but, if it is at the fame time weak,
it is dangerous, and raifes a fufpicion o f a total lofs o f ftrength. B ut a pulfe which
is flow and large denotes fufficient remains o f ftrength, tenlion, and thicknefs o f the
fibres of the heart and arteries; and a vifeid and tenacious blood. A ll unequal
pulfes are very bad, fince they denote that there is neither a due influx o f the
fpirits, nor a proper and equal mixture o f the b lo od 5 but particularly fuch pulfes
always prognofticate unlucky events, when they are weak. Intermittent pulfes are
alfo o f a bad kind, or generally accounted the prefages o f death. But it is not uni.
verfally fo *. for an intermittent pulfe frequently happens without danger, where,
for inftance, the fymptoms are o f a bad kind, and the patient’s ftrength ftill entire.
Hence this fpecies o f pulfe frequently happens in hypochondriac and melancholic
patients, where the inteftine motion o f the blood is diminifhed by its thicknefs.
But, when the pulfe is weak and quick at the fame time, it generally prognoflricates
death. A n hard pulfe generally indicates pains, fpafms, and convulflons, becaufe
the fibres o f the heart and arteries are fpafmodically conftridfced, T h e irregular,
caprizating,
caprizating, and difcontinued, pulfes, denote a very bad ftace o f the body, both with
lefpecfc to the fluid and (olid pares.
It is carefully to be obferved, that one kind o f pulfe is not found in all perfons;
for the pulfe dejiends on the tone o f the m ufcular fibres, on the influx o f the fpirics,
and the nature and temperament o f the blood; and, as all thefe are furprifingly va ­
rious in human bodies, with refpedt to age, fex, the fcafon o f the year, the climate,
the method o f life, the fleep, and the pafflons o f the mind, fo alfo the pulfes vary
from each other according as thefe circumftances differ. T h u s men generally have
a large and vehement pulfe, and women one o f a more flow and weak kind *
, for the
former have ftronger fibres and a hotter blood than the latter. For this reafon alfo,
the circulation o f the blood is brifker in men than in women; and the former do
not generate luch loads o f redundant blood and humours as women, who are gene­
rally weaker, and more fubjedt to difeafes. Choleric perfons, and thofe o f fangui-
neo-choleric conductions, have a larger, quicker, and mere vehement, pulfe, than
phlegmatic and melancholic pe-fons; for which reafon the fluids move more qu ick­
ly, theexcretions are made more expeditioufly, and the blood is more fluid, in the
former than in the latter; for the blood o f the former is impregnated with a larger
quantity o f oleous and fulphureous parts, which are the fcurce and matrix o f heat
and fpirituous quantity. T hus alfo, thofe o f a flender habit, who have ftrong fibres,
and large veflels, have a larger and ftronger pulfe than thofe who are fat, have lax
fibres, and narrow veflels. H ence they are alfo founder, more robuft, and more
capable o f enduring fatigue. T h is is alfo the reafon why thofe who are naturally
thick and fat are more readily feized with ficknels, and deflroyed by it, than thofe
o f flender habits. In infants and children, the pulfe is frequent and foft *
, whereas,
in old perfons, it is flow and large, whilft in young perfons, and thofe fu ll grown,
it is large and vehem ent; for generally infants and children generate a larger quan­
tity o f humours (which are neceflary to their grow th), and colic# a great deal o f for-
des, which is the reafon why infants and children are more generally feized with fick-
nefs, and more readily die o f it, than youths and adults. O ld perfons have thick blood,
but rigid fibres s for which reafon their pulfe is hard, and makes a forcible impref-
fion on the to u ch ; but in infants and children the pulfe is foft, on account o f the
ter.dernefs and laxity o f the fibres. T h e pulfe is alfo changed by the feafon o f the
year, the exercife o f the body, the aliments, and theaffe#ion$ o f the mind. In the
middle o f the fpring, the pulfe is large and vehement *
, at this feafon alfo the ftrength
is greateft; for which reafon perfons are at that time moft rarely fick, and recover
m od cafily: in the middle o f the fummer the pulfe is quicker and weaker, becaufe
by the intenfe heat the ftrength is impaired, whilft the inteftine motion o f the fluids
is greater than it ufually is. In autumn the pulfe is flower, fofter, and weaker, than

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . ic^
the middle o f the fummer, thole which are cold to the winter, and fuch as are tem ­
perate to the fpring.
Exercife increafes the pulfe, and confequently the circulation o f the blood, whilft
an idle and inactive Rate renders the pulfe flow, weak, and languid, and diminifliex
the circulation o f the fluids. Spirituous aliments render the pulle large, and vehe­
ment, and frequent. T h e pulfe o f fuch as are afleep is flow, fmall, and languid;
but, as foon as they awake, it forthwith becomes large, quicker, and ftronger; the
pulfe o f thofe who are angry is large, vehement, and q u ic k ; that o f fuch as are
frighted, frequent, fmall, and inactive; and o f thofe who are forrowful, fmall, lan­
guid, and flo w ; hence the common and ordinary affections o f the body change the
pulle, fo that, without duly adverting to thefe affections, the pulle cannot be cer­
tainly underltood, nor can it be determined how far it recedes from a natural ftate
in confequence o f difeafes.
T h e natural pulfe is therefore to be felt and to be obferved, not immediately after
exercife, bathing, immoderate eating, drinking wine, or ether caufes which exagitate
the heart and fpirits •
> for we are to determine nothing about the pulfe till the force
o f external caufes has ceafed, and all perturbations o f the body are allayed •, for
the pulfe is the molt certain flgn and criterion for judging o f the motion o f the heart
and blood *
, but, if the pulfe alone is obferved, without paying a due regard to other
circumftances, it may lay a foundation for form ing a falfe ju dgm en t; fince the
pulfe may be difturbed by a thoufand abflraCt caufes.
A ll authors, both ancient and modern, agree, that a frequent pulfe, in every fpecies
o f fever, whether continual or intermittent, whether benign or malignant, whether
in its beginning or at its height, proves fuch a fever to be prefcnt; hence the quick
or frequent pulfe is confidered as the true elTential flgn o f fevers; but this
frequency is either greater or lefs, and aflociates itfelf with the great or vehement,
or with the fmall and weak, according to the diverfity o f fevers, and the times o f the
difeafe. A frequent pulfe, when weak and fmall, is fcarcely ever good ; fince it de­
notes a languid and flow circulation o f the b lo od ; but a frequent, large, and vehe­
ment, pulle, fuch as is generally obferved in the height o f continual fevers, denotes
a brisk circulation o f the blood, and an increafed heat o f the body. In inveftigating
the c&ufe o f a frequent pulfe, which is generally preternatural, and accompanies
leveral diforders, we fhall follow the accurate Bellini, who accounts for the motion
o f the heart from the influx o f the blood through the coronary arteries, and o f the
nervous fluid through the nerves, into the fibres o f the heart j whence he concludes,
that the mufcles o f the heart arem oft frequently moved when the nervous fluid is
moft frequently conveyed into them, which happens when it is forced into them
by afufRcient quantity o f blood flowing forcibly into the brain. N ow , by a fre-
33- 1*f quent
no
quent contra&ion o f the heart a frequent pulfe is produced, which indicates that a
properquasnityof blood is conveyed to the brain,and that the brain is forcibly preiTed,
which will happen, either when the blood ftagnates therein, in confequence o f an ob-
flruction o f its veins, or when the blood, contained in thefe veins, cannot flow in other
parrs,or in the lungs; or when the blood is thrown into aftateofelFervefcence, by which
it aflumes a tendency to move in every direction with a greater impetus, and by that
means prcfles the brain more powerfully ; the mufcles o f the heart alfo move more
frequently when irritated by any ftimulus. If, therefore, the blood is too acid or hot,
fo as to Sim ulate the finufes o f the heart, the heart will be more frequently contra&ed,
and the frequency o f the pulfe will indicate a Aimulating quality in the blood.
Since from the pulfe we thus form a judgm ent not only o f the circulation and
temperature o f the blood, but alfo o f the motion o f the fpirits, and the fttcogth
of the patienr, fo the knowledge o f the pulfe, and a due attention to it, becomes o f
Angular fervice, not only in invefligating the nature o f diforders, and form ing a
right judgm ent concerning them, but alfo in p referrin g medicines for their cure.
But they m ult be carefully, not fuperficially, confulted. T h e phyficians o f China
are far more careful in this refpeft than thofe o f Europe; for the Chinefe often fpend
a whole hour in feeling the pulfe, whilft the E nglifh phyficians have hardly patience
to feel above two pulfations; a practice highly culpable, fince, after ten ftrokes o f
the artery, an inequality or intermilfion often occurs, which happens when the un­
equally mixed blood pafies through the heart. T h e pulfe is alfo to be felt in both
wrilts, in the neck, and in the temples; fince it is certain, from experience, that the
pulfe in the wrifts frequently varies, and may be more commodioufly felt in one than
another. W e ought alfo to advert to the pulles o f other parts; thus, fometimes hy­
pochondriac patients perceive a large pulfe under the ribs on the left fide, which
happens when a quick and vifeid blood, exagitated by heat, or any other caufe, en­
deavours to procure a quick palfage through the pancreas and fpleen, but, flopping
in their narrow veflels, produces a pulfation, and a kind o f pricking pain.
In continual and malignant fevers a large internal pulfation in the veins o f the head
generally denotes a fubfequent delirium ; fince it is a fign that the blood there con-
gefted circulates flowly, till at laft, becoming ftagnant, it produces a violent inflam­
mation o f the meninges. I f a large pulfe arifes from an excefiive ebullition o f the
blood, fo that in fevers the veins o f the temples beat, and the face is turgid, with­
out a foftnefs o f the praecordia, there is reafon to fufpeft that the difeafe w ill be
long, and that it will not terminate without a large hajmorrhage from the nofe, an
hiccough, convulfions, or fciatic pains. T h e reafon o f this is, that the redundant
blood feeks for an outlet either by the nofe or the hasmorrhoidal vein s; and the
fooner this happens, the fooner the patient is free from his diforder.

W hen a pulfation is obferved in any part o f the body, where at other times it is
not felt, we may certainly conclude, that the part is inflamed and difpofed toafup -
puration, efpecially when it is accompanied with tumour and pain. A n hard pulfe
is almoft an infallible fign in the membranous parts ; for this fcardnefs o f the pulfe,
orexceflivetenfion and vibration o f the artery, indicates fomething o f a fpafmodic
nature, arifing from the content o f the parts, and produced by the inflammation and
pain. T h e pulfe o f perfons labouring under difordersof the breaft, or a palpitation
o f the heart, is frequent, unequal, and languid; but fuch a pulie, unltfs when
vehement, is accompanied with no preternatural hear, and happens becaufe the
blood does not pafs through the finufesof the heart and the lobes o f the lungs. In
weaknefs, and a difpofition o f fyncopes, the pulfe is generally fmall, rare, and lan­
gu id; but, if the pulfe is abfolutely imperceptible, the body covered with a cold
fweat, and the functions o f the mind are not totally deftroyed, 1 have obferved, that
the patient infallibly dies in fix hours: and fuch a fituation I have feen produced by
corrofive poifon. It is to be obferved, that about the critical times in fevers, when
nature endeavours to throw o ff the fuperfluous and peccant matter by ftool orfwear,
the pulfe, though languid, is yet more regular and lefs frequent, which is a certain
fign of recovery. B ut, if the pulfe is foft and undulating, it isafign th at afalutary
and critical fweat isju ft coming on.
It is alfo to be obferved, that the pulfe is changed by medicines. T h u s, after draf-
tic purgatives, which procure too many ftools, the pulfe is generally preternaturally
quick. A fter venaifadtion, efpecially in plethoric habits, the pulle becomes quicker,
a fign that the circulation o f the blood, in confequence o f its having a larger fpace,
is happily increafed, fince by this means afupprefiion o f themer.fesor hasmorrhoides
is generally removed. It is certain, not only from the authority o f Sydenham,
but alio from experience, that, after the ufe o f chalybeats, the pulfe is quicker, the
face redder, and the heat greater. Strong fudorifics, compofed o f volatile oleous
fubftances, greatly increafe the pulfation o f the heart and arteries; on the contrary,
anodynes, opiates, preparation of nitre, precipitating powders, acids, and fuch things
as diminifh the inteftine motion o f the blood and fix its fulphur, render the pulfe
calm and moderate in pains,.inflammations, and febrile intemperature. Some very
uieful and important rules for the exhibition o f medicines are drawn from the ftate
o f the pulfe: thus purging and vomiting are contra-indicated by a too quick and
vehement pulfe;for, when the blood is in a violent motion and ebullition, the feerc-
tions are generally very languid. If the ftrength is defective, which may be known
by the languid ftate o f the pulle, emetics and purgatives diminilh the ftrength ftill
m ore; fo that the phyfician ought to confult the pulfe before he exhibits them. For
when the pulfe is ftrong, and the motion o f the blood regular, thefe artificial evacu­
ations
I l l C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
ations arc m oil beneficial, and fucceed beft. T h e fame caution is neceffary in the
exhibition o f fudorifics and all analeptics, which convey heat and motion to the
blood; for, if the pulfe is ttrong and frequent, fuch fpirituous fubftances do more
injury than good; they rarefy the blood too m uch, and accelerate its inteftine m o­
tion; by which means a delirium and other inflammations are frequently brought
on. Great circum fpcftion and attention to the pulfe is alforequifue in the exhibition
o f narcotics or opiates; for, as thefe are poffefied o f a power o f (topping the motion
o f the blood and (pints, and confequently o f impairing ftrength, (o they ought never
to be exhibited when the pulfe is weak, languid, and fmall, but are to be avoided
like poifon.

D I S E A S E introduced the art o f M edicine, which in a primitive fenfe, com m uni­
cates the means o f preferving health when prefent, and o f reftoring it when loft. I f
we look back into the origin o f the medical art, we (hall find its firft foundations to
be owing to the accidental events, and natural inftinft. In the early ages, the Tick
were placed in crofs ways, and other public places, to receive the advice o f fuch
paflengers as knew a remedy fuitable to their com plaints; and, the better to pre-
ferve the memory o f every remarkable cure, both the difeafe and the remedy were
engraved on pillars, that patients in the like cafes might refort to them for inftruc-
tion and relief. H ence an infight into the virtues o f herbs and plants, o f metals and
minerals, was originally acquired.
A s to the part which reafon has afted in the improvement o f medicine, itfeem s to
have confided in obferving, i. T h a t difeafes attended with particular circuroltances,
called f>mptoms, were fometimes cured without the afliftance o f art, by fpontaneous
evacuations, as haemorrhages, diarrhoeas, vom itings, or fweats; whence bleeding,
purges, and vomits, took their rife. 2. T h a t the patients were often relieved by the
breaking out o f various tumours; whence arofe the application o f topical remedies.
A nd, indeed, it is the belt method o f im proving phyfic, to obferve carefully what
means nature, unaflifted by art, employs to free the conftitution from diftempers;
fince many important hints may be thence taken, for the relief o f other patients un­
der thelike circumftances. H e, who would advance the healing art, ought to colled
a (cleft treafureof practical obfervations, reft fatisfied with a few but well-chofen
medicines, be thoroughly acquainted with their virtues and efficacy in different con-
ftitutions and difeafes, defpife the cumberfome load o f recipes with which praftical
writers o f an inferior rank abound, rejeft the fo m uch extolled medicines o f theche-
mifts, and attempt the relief o f patients by a proper diet and exercife, and fuch me­
dicines
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y ,
uicines asobfervation and found philofophy recommend: for to the improvement o f
anatom) and natural philofophy is much o f the fuccefs o f phyfic to be attributed.
T h e knowledge o f medicines* or fuitable remedies, is alfo highly neceflary to thole,
who, in order to moderate the impetus in acute diforders, make evacuations, blunt
acrimony, dilute too thick fluids, condenfe thofe that are too thin, brace up too lax
parts, and relax fuch as are too much conftri&ed; they alfo drive the humours to
parts where they will be lead prejudicial, upon occafion mitigate pain, and in lan­
guors ufe (Simulating medicines. W ine, vinegar, barley, nitre, honey, rhubarb,
opium, and other fimples, are found both fafe and powerful medicines. Sydenham
tells us, that all manner o f difeafes may be cured by bleeding, purging, with a fub
lequcnt opiate, and proper regimen. In chronical cafes, mineral waters, fairs, dia­
phoretics, foap, mercury, ftcel, with a few vegetables, and proper exercife, will
generally efife<5t the cure. In a word, what is there in the m od elaborate preparation,
that is worth h a lf the pains taken about it? M ercury, opium, the Peruvian bark, and
other fimples, with fire and water, are acknowledged as the fureft remedies by the
abled matters o f the art; and thefe are found to be more efficacious in that crude
date, in which bountiful nature has imparted them to us, than after the m od ope-
rofe and artificial preparations. W ecan defpair o f nothing, while we follow fim-
plicity ; but the event o f intricate labour is fallacious.
Difeafes, in this and other countries, often flow from local circumftanccs; whence
they admit o f great mitigation, and fometimes o f being entirely prevented, particu­
larly if proper and timely means be taken for that purpofe. Difeafed parents, un-
wholefomefood, confined air, and uncommonly wet, cold, damp, or hot, feafons, are
the forerunners o f various diforders; and, as thefe are generally forefeen and known,
it fhould be the duty o f every individual to guard againfl them.
£ len are alfo expoled to particular difeafes from the occupations which they fol­
low. Chymifts, founders, glafs-makers, and feveral other artifls, are hurt by the
unwholefome air which they areobliged to breathe. T h is air is not only loaded with
the noxicus exhalations arifing from metals and minerals, but is fo charged with
phlogifton as to be rendered unfit for expanding the lungs fufficiently, and anfwer-
ing the other important purpofes o f refpiration. H ence proceed afthmas, coughs,
and confbmptions o f the lungs, fo incident to perfons who follow thefe employments.
Such artifts ought never to continue tco long at w ork; and when they give over they
(hould fuffer themfelves to cool gradually. T h ey ought never to drink large quan­
tities o f cold, weak, or watery, liquors, while their bodies are hot, nor to indulge in
any thing that is cold on the ftomach.
Miners, and all who work under ground, are likewife hurt by unwholefome air.
T h e air, by its ftagnation in deep mines, not only lofes its proper fpring and other
33. G g qualities
qualities neceffary for refpiration, “
but is often loaded wi:h fuch noxious exhalationj
as to become a moft deadly poifon. Miners are not only hurt by unwholefome air,
but likewife by the particles o f metal which adhere to their (kin, clothes, & c. T hele
arc abforbed, or taken up into the body, and occafion palfies, vertigoes, and other
nervous affections, which often prove fatal. Fallopius obferves, that thofe who
work in mines o f mercury feldom live above three or four years. L ead, and feveral
other metals, are likewife very pernicious to the health.
A ll who work in mines or metals ought to wafli carefully, and to change their
clothes as foon as they give over working. N othing would tend more to preferve
the health o f fuch people than a ftri£t and almoft religious regard to cleanlinefs.
Plumbers, painters, gilders, fmelcers, makers o f white lead, and many others who
work in metals, are liable to the fame difeafes as miners, and ought to obferve the
fame directions for avoiding them. Tallow-chandlers, boilers o f oil, and all who
work in putrid animal fubftances, are likewife liable to fuffer from the unwholefome
fmells or effluvia o f thefe bodies. T h ey ought to pay the fame regard to cleanlinefs
as miners j and when they are troubled with naufea, ficknefs, or indigeftion, they
fhould take a gentle purge.
T hofe who follow laborious employments are in general the m ofthealthyof man­
kind, yet the nature o f their occupations, and the places where they are carried on,
expoie them to fome particular difeafes. Hufbandm en, for exam ple, are expofed to
all the viciflitudes o f the weather, which, in this country, are often very great and
fudden, and occafion colds, coughs, quinfies, rheumatifms, fevers, and other acute
diforders. T h ey are likewife forced to w ork hard, and often carry burdens above
their ftrength, which, by overdrawing the veffels, occafions afthmas, ruptures, & c .
Such as bear heavy burdens, as porters, labourers, 5cc. are obliged to draw the
air with much greater force, and alfo to keep their lungs diftended with more v io ­
lence, than is neceffary for common refpiration: by this means the tender veffels
o f the lungs are overftretched, and often burft, infomuch that a fpitting o f blood or
fever enfues. Hippocrates mentions an inftance to this purpofe, o f a man, who,
upon a wager, carried an aft; but was foon after feized with a fever, a vom iting o f
blood, and a rupture. Carrying heavy burdens is generally the effect o f mere lazl-
nefs, which prompts people to do at once what fliould be done at twice. Sometimes
it proceeds from vanity or emulation. H ence it is, that the ftrongeft men arem oft
commonly hurt by heavy burdens, hard labour, or feats o f activity. It is rare to
find one who boafts o f his ftrength without a rupture, a fpitting o f blood, or fome
difeafe, which he reaps as the fruit o f his folly. W hen the mufcles are violently
(trained, frequent reft is neceffary, in order that they may recover their tone; with­
out this, the ftrength and conftitution will foon be worn out, and a premature old
ig c brought on.

Labourers.
i *5
Labourers in the hot feafon are apt to lie down and deep in the fun. T h is prac­
tice is fo dangerous, that they often wake in a burning fever. Thefe ardent fevers,
which provefo fatal about the end o f fummer and beginning o f autumn, are fre­
quently occafioned by this means. Fevers o f a very bad kind are often occafioned
among labourers by poor living. W hen the body is not fufficiently nourifiied, the
humours become vitiated, and the folids w eak» from whence the m od fatal confe-
quences enfuc. Poor living is likewife productive o f many o f thofe cutaneous dif-
eales fo frequent among the lower clafsof people. It is remarkable that cattle, when
pinched in their food, are generally affeCted with difeafes o f the (kin, which fcldom
fail to difappear when they are put upon a good pafture. T h is (hews how much a
good date o f the humours depends upon a fufficicnt quantity of proper nourifliment.
Poverty not only occafions, but aggravates, many o f the difeafes of the laborious,
and makes them miferable indeed. H ere the godlike virtue o f charity ought always
to exert itfelf. T o relieve the indudrious poor in didrefs, is furely the mod exalted
aft of religion and humanity. They alone, who are witnefTes o f thofe feenes o f ca­
lamity, can form a notion o f what numbers perifh in difeafes, for* want o f proper at-
fidance, and even for want o f the necedaries o f life:
Soldiers fuffer many hardfhips-from the inclemency o f feafons, long marches, bad
provifions, hunger, watching, unwholefome climates, bad water, & c. T hele oc-
cafion fevers, fluxes, rheunutifms, and other fatal difeafes, which generally do great­
er execution than the fword, efpecially when campaigns are continued too late in the
year. A few weeks o f cold rainy weather will often prove more fatal than an en­
gagement. Sailors may alfo be numbered am ongd the laborious. T h ey undergo
great hardfhips from change o f climate, the violence o f the weather, hard labour,
& c. One great fource o f the difeafes o f fea-faring people is excels. "When they get
on Ihore, after having been long at fea, without regard to the climate, or their own
conditutions, they plunge headlong into all manner o f riot, and even perfid till a
fever puts an end to their lives. T hus intemperance, and not the climate, is often the
caufe why fo many o f our brave failors die on foreign coads. Such people ought
not to live too low •, but they would find moderation the bed defence againd fevers,
and many other maladies. W e have reafon to believe, if due attention were paid
to the diet, air, clothing, and above all things to the cleanlinefs, o f fea-faring peo­
ple, they would be the m od healthy fet o f men in the world but, when they are neg­
lected, the very reverfe will happen.
Nothing can be more contrary to the health and nature o f man than a fedemary
life, yet this clafs comprehends the far greater part o f the fpecies. A lm od the whole
female world, and, in manufacturing countries, the major part o f the males, may be

feems to be no reafon why any perfon fhould be confined for life to ihefe alone. It
is conftant confinement that ruins the health. A man will not be hurt by fitting five
or fix hours a-day > but, if he be obliged to fit ten or twelve, in confined air, he will
foon become injured in his health. Unwholefom eair is the caufeof manydiforders.
Few are aware o f the danger arifing from it. People generally pay fome attention
to what they eat and drink, but feldom regard what goes into the lungs, though the
latter often proves more fuddenly fatal than the former. A fedentary life feldom
fails to occafion an univerfal relaxation o f the folids. T h is is the great fource from
whence moft o f the difeafes o f fedentary people flow. T h e fcrophula, confumption,
hyfterics, and nervous difeafes, now fo common, were very little known in this coun­
try before fedentary artificers became fo num erous: and they are very .little known
flill am ong fuch o f our people as follow a<ftive employments without doors, though
in great towns at leaft two-thircs o f the inhabitants are affiidted with them. In-
(lead o f m ultiplying rules for preferving the health o f the fedentary, we fhall re­
commend to them the following plan, viz. T h a t every perfon w ho follows a feden­
tary employment fhould cultivate a piece o f ground with his own hand. T h is he
might dig, plant, fow, and weed, at leifure hours, fo as to m ake it an exercife and
amufement, while it produced many o f the neceflaries o f life. A fter w orking an
hour in a garden, a man will return with more keennefs to his employment within
doors, than if he had been all the while idle. Labouring the ground is every way
conducive to health. Itn ot only gives exercife toevery part o f the body, but the
very fmell o f the earth and frelh herbs revives and cheers the fpirits, w hilft the per­
petual profpect o f fomething coming to maturity delights and entertains the mind.
W e are fo formed as to be always pleafed with fomewhat in profpeft, however
diftant or however trivial. Hence the happinefs that men feel in planting, fowing,
bu .lding, & c. Thefe feem to have been the chief employments o f the more early
ages: and, when kings and conquerers cultivated the ground, there is reafon to be­
lieve, that they knew as well wherein true happinefs confifted as we do. In a word,
exercife without doors, in one fliape or another, is abfoluicly neceflary to health.
Thofe w honegle& ic, though they may drag out life,can hardly be faid to enjoy it.
W eak and effeminate, they languifh for a few years, and foon drop into an untimely
grave.
Every difeafe may be confidered as an aflemblage o f fymptoms, and m ud be dif-
tinguilhed by thofe that are moft obvious and permanent} for, by a due attention
to them, the inveftigation o f difeafes in general will be found a much lefs difficult "
matter than people are ready to imagine. A proper attention to the patient’s age,
fex, temper o f m ind, conftitution, and manner o f life, will likewife greatly affift,
both in the inveftigation and treatment o f difeafes. In childhood the fibres are lax
and
i .-5 C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 1*7
and fofr, the nerves extremely irritable, and the fluids thin ; whereas in old age the
fibres are rigid, the nerves become almoft infenlible, and many o f the veflels im-
perviable. Thefe and other peculiarities render the difeafes o f the young and aged
very different, and ot courfe they m ud require a different method o f treatment. F e­
males are liable to many difeafes which do not affiiCt the other fex: befides, the
nervous fydem being more irritable in them than in men, their difeafes require to be
treated with greater caution. T h ey are lefs able to bear large evacuations ; and all
ftimulating medicines ought to be adminidered to them with a fparing hand. T h e
temper o f mind ought to be carefully attended to in all difeafes. Fear, anxiety, and
a fretful temper, both occafion and aggravate difeafes. In vain do we apply medi­
cines to the body to remove maladies which proceed from the mind. W hen that is a f •
feCted, the bed medicine is to foothe the paflions, to divert the mind from anxious
thought, and to keep the patient as eafy and cheerful as poflible. Few things are o f
greater importance, in the cure o f difeafes, than cleanlinefs. W hen a patient is dif­
fered :o lie in dirty clothes, whatever perfpires from his body is again reforbed, o r .
taken up into it, which ferves to nourifh the difeafe, and increafe the danger. M any
difeafes may be cured by cleanlinefs alone ; m od o f them may be mitigated by it,
and in all o f them it is highly neceflary both for the patient and thofe who attend him.
O f F E V E R S .
F E V E R S are not only the mod frequent o f all difeafes, but they are likewife the
m od com plex: in the m od Ample fpecies o f fever there is always a combination o f
feveral different fymptoms. T h e diftinguifliing fymptoms o f fever are, increafed
heat, frequency o f pulfe, lofs o f appetite, general debility, pain in the head, and a
difficulty in performing fome o f the vital and animal functions. T h e other fymp­
toms ufually attendant on fevers are, naufea, third, anxiety, delirium, wearinefs,
wading o f the flefh, want o f fleep, or the deep didurbed and not refrefhing. A s a
fever is only an effort o f Nature to free herfelf from an offending caufe, it is the bu-
iinefsof thofe who have the care o f the fick, to obferve with diligence which way
Nature points, and to endeavour to aflid her operations. O ur bodies are fo framed,
as to have a condant tendency to sxpel or throw o ff whatever is injurious to health.
T his is generally done by urine, fweat, dool, expectoration, vom it, or fome other
evacuation. There is reafon to believe, if the efforts o f nature, at the beginning o f
a fever, were duly attended to and promoted, it would feldom continue long; but
when her attempts are either neglected or counteracted, it is no wonder if the difeafe
proves fatal. There are daily inftances o f perfons who, after catching cold, have all
the fymptoms o f a beginning fever; but, by keeping warm, drinking diluting liquors,
batihng the feet in warm water, & c, the fymptoms in a few hours difappear, and the
34. H b dangejr
danger is prevented. W hen fevers o f a putrid kind threaten, the bed method o f
obviating their effects is by repeated vomits. A lm oft every perfon in a fever com­
plains o f great third, and calls out ford rin k, efpecially o f a cooling nature. T h is
at once points out the ufe o f water and other cooling liquors. W h at is fo likely to
abate the heat, attenuate the humours, remove fpafms and obdruftions, promote
peilpiration, increafe the quantity o f urine, and, in fhort, produce every falutary ef-
tcdl in an ardent or inflammatory fever, as drinking plentifully o f water, thin gruel,
or any other weak liquor o f which water is the bafts? T h e neceffity o f diluted li­
quors is pointed out by the dry tongue, the parched fkin, and the burning heat, as
well as by the unquenchable third, o f the patient. M any cooling liq-uors, which are
extremely grateful to patients in a fever, may be prepared from fruits, as deco&ions
o f tamarinds, apple-tree, orange-whey, and the like. M ucilaginous liquors might
alfo be prepared from marlhmallow roots, linfecd, lime-tree buds, and other m ild
vegetables particularly pointed out in the H erbal. T hefe liquors, efpecially when
acidulated, are highly agreeable to the patient, and fhould never be denied him.
In fevers the mind as well as body fhould be kept eafy. Company is fcldom agree­
able to one that is Pick. Indeed every thing that difturbs the imagination increafes
the difeafe; for whichreafon every perfon in afever ought to be kept perfectly quiet,
and neither allowed to fee or hear any thing that may in the lead affefl ordifeompofe
his mind. W h a t food the patient takes fhould be in fmall quantity, light, and o f
eafy digeftlon. It ought to be chiefly o f the vegetable kind, as panada, roafted ap­
ples, gruels, and fuch like. T h efreffi air fhould likewife be taken as m uch as pof-
fible; it not only removes his anxiety, but cools the blood, revives thefpirics, and
proves every way beneficial. A m on gd common people, the very name o f a fever
generally fuggeds the neceflity o f bleeding. T h is notion feems to have taken its
rile from m od fevers in this country having been form erly o f an inflammatory na­
ture^ but true inflammatory fevers are now fcldom to be met with. Sedentary o c­
cupations, and a different manner o f living, have fo changed the date o f dtfeafes in
Britain, that there is now hardly one fever in ten where the lancet is neceflary. In
m od low , nervous, and putrid, fevers, which are now fo common, bleeding is really
hurtful, as it weakens the patient, finks his fpirits, See. W e would recommend
this general rule, never to bleed at the beginning o f a fever, unlefs there be evident
figns o f inflammation. Bleeding is an excellent medicine when neceflary, but fliould
never be wantonly performed. It is likewife a common notion, that fweating is al­
ways neceflary in the beginning o f a fever. W hen the fever proceeds from an ob-
il fueled perfpiration, this notion is not ill-founded. I f the patient only lies in bed,
bathes his feet and legs in warm water, and drinks freely o f w ater-gruel,oranyother
weak diluting liquor, he w ill feldom fail to perfpire freely. T h e warmth o f the

bed. and the diluting drink, will relax the univerfal fpafm, which generally affe&s
the (kin at the beginning of a fever * it will open the pores, and promote the perfpi-
ration, by means o f which the fever may often be carried off. But, inftead o f this,
the common praftice is to heap clothes upon the patient, and to give him tilings ot
a hot nature, as fpirits, fpiceries, See. which fire his blood, increafe the fpafms, and
render the difeafe more dangerous. In all fevers a proper attention fhould be paid to
a patient’s longings. Thefe are the calls o f Nature, and often point out what may be
o f real ufe. #Patients are not indeed to be indulged in everything that the fickly ap­
petite may crave j but it is generally right to let them have a little o f what they
eagerly defire, though it may not feem altogether proper. W hat the patient longs
for, his ftomach will generally digeft; and fuch things have fometimes a very hap­
py effeft.
O f I N T E R M I T T I N G F E V E R S , o r A G U E S .
T H E feveral kinds o f intermitting fevers, or agues, take their names from the
period in which the fit returns, as quotidian, tertian, quartan, See, T hey are gene­
rally occafioned by effluvia from putrid flagnated water. T h is isevident from their
abounding in rainy feafons, and being molt frequent in countries where the foil is
marlhy, as in H olland, the Fens o f Cambridgefhire, the Hundreds o f E flex, & c .
T his difeafe may alfo be occafioned by eating too much (tone-fruit, by a poor watery
diet, damp houfes, evening dews, lying upon the damp ground, watching, fatigue,
depreffing paffions, and the like. W hen the inhabitants o f a high country retire to
a low one, they are apt to prove fatal. In a word, whatever relaxes the folids, dimi-
nifhes the (>erfpiration, or obftructs the circulation in the capillary or fmall vefTeK
difpofes the body to agues.
C U R E .— A s the chief intentions o f cure in an ague are to brace the folids, and
promote perfpiration, the patient ought to take as much exercife between the fits as
he can bear. I f he be able to go abroad, riding on horfeback, or in a carriage,
w ill be o f great fervice. B ut, if he cannot bear that kind o f exercife, he ought to
take fuch as his ftrength will permit. N othing tends more to prolong an intermit­
ting fever, than indulging a lazy indolent difpofition. In this dileale, the fiomach
is generally loaded with cold vifeid phlegm, and frequently great quantities o f bile
are difeharged by vom it;.w hich plainly points out the necefflty o f fuch evacuations.
Vom its are therefore to be adminiftered before the patient takes any other medicine.
But, if the patient be afraid to take a vom it, he ought to cleanfe the bowels by a dofe
or two of Glauber’s fait, jalap, or rhubarb: after this, two ounces o f the beft Pe­
ruvian bark, finely powdered, may be divided into twenty-four dofes. Thefe may
either be made into bolufles, as they are ufed, with a little fyrup o f lemon, or mixed
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . iv }
2 in
ir. a glaia or red w ine, a cup o f camomile-tea, water-gruel, or any other drink that
is more agreeable to the patient. In an ague which returns every day, one o f the
above doles may be taken every two hours during the interval o f the fits. In a ter-
rian, or third-day ague, it will be fuffictent to take a dole every third hour during
the interval; and in a quartan, every fourth. I f the patient cannot take fo large a
dofe o f the bark, he may divide each o f the powders into two parts, and take one
every hour, & c . F or a young perfon, a fmaller quantity o f this medicine w ill be
fu.'ficient, and the dofe muff be adapted to the age, conftitution, and violence o f the
fymptoms. T h e above quantity o f bark will frequently cure an a gu e; the patient,
however, ought not to leave o ff taking the medicine as foon as the paroxyfm s are
{topped, but ftiould continue to ufe ic till there is rcafon to believe the difeafe is
entirely overcome. M o ll o f the failures in the cure o f this difeafe are ow ing to
patients not continuing to ufe the medicine long enough. T h ey are generally di­
rected to take it till the fits are ftopped, then to leave it off, and begin again at fome
diftance o f tim e; by which means the difeafe gathers ftrength, and often returns
with as much violence as before. A relapfe may always be prevented, and the cure
greatly facilitated, by ufing the follow ing infufion for fome confiderable time as
a drink: take an ounce o f gen:ian root ♦, o f calamus aromaticus, and orange-peel,
each half an ounce, with three or four handfuls o f camomile Bowers, and an hand­
ful o f coriander-feed, all bruifed together in a m ortar; put h alf an handful o f thefe
ingredients into a tea-pot, and pour ihcieon a pine o f boiling water. A large
tea-cup full o f this infufion Ihould be drunk three or four times a day* by which
means a fmaller quantity o f bark than is generally ufed will be fufficient to cure an
ague. There is no doubt but many o f our own plants or barks, which are very
bi:ter and aftringent, would fucceed in the cure o f intermittent fevers, efpecially
when affifted by aromatics j and it is only by the ufe o f fundry o f thofe herbs re­
commended in the H erbal as antidotes againft agues, that many old women in
country places fo effectually cure the ague, after it has baffled every exertion o f
thedoftor. In obftinate agues, when the patient is old, the habit phlegm atic, the
feafon rainy, the fuuation damp, or the like, it will be neceflary to add to the above
two ounces o f the bark, half an ounce o f Virginian lnake-root, and a quarter o f an
ounce o f ginger, or fome other warm arom atic; or, if the fymptoms be o f an inflam­
matory nature, half an ounce of fait o f wormwood or fait o f tartar may be added to
the above quantity o f bark. A s autumnal and winter agues generally prove much
more obftinate than thofe which attack the patient in fprin gor fummer, it w ill be
neceflary to continue the ufe o f the foregoing medicines longer in the form er than
in the latter. If agues are not properly cured, they often degenerate into obftinate
chronical difeafes, as the dropfy, jaundice, & c . F or this reafon all poffible care

fhould be taken to have them radically cured, before the humours be vitiated, and
the confticution fpoiled. T o prevent agues, people fhould endeavour to avoid their
caufes. T h e following preventive medicine may however be o f ufe to fuch as are
obliged to live in low marfhy countries, or who are liable to frequent attacks o f this
difeafe. T a k e an ounce o f the beft Peruvian bark* Virginian fnake-root, and orange-
peel, o f each h alf an ounce; bruife them all together, and infufe for five or fix
days in a bottle o f brandy, H olland gin, or wine*, afterwards pour o ff the clear
liquor, and take a wine-glafs o f it twice or thrice a-day. T hofe who can bring
themfelves to chew the bark will find that method fucceed very well. Gen­
tian root, or calamus aromaticus, may alfo be chewed by turns for the fame pur-
pofe. A ll bitter herbs are antidotes to agues, efpecially thofe that are warm and
aftringent.
O f a m A C U T E C O N T I N U A L F E V E R .
T H I S fever is denominated acute, ardent, or inflammatory. It moft commonly
attacks the young, o r perfons about the prime or vigour o f life, efpecially fuch as
live high, abound with blood, and whofe fibres are ftrong and elaftic. It feizes peo­
ple at all feafons o f the year; but is moft frequent in the fpring and beginning o f
fummer. It may be occafioned by any thing that overheats the body, or produces
plethora$ as violent exercife, fleeping in the fun, drinking ftrong liquors, eating
fpiceries, a full diet, with little exercife, & c. It may likewife be occafioned by
whatever obftrufts the perfpiration ; as lying on the damp ground, drinking cold li­
quor when the body is hot, night-watching, or the like.
C U R E .— A s this difeafe is always attended with danger, the beft medical affift-
ance ought to be procured as foon as pofiible; and fuch medicines fhould be ufed
as are calculated to dilute the blood, correct the acrimony o f the humours, allay the
exceffive heat, remove the fpafmodic ftrifture o f the veflels, and promote the fecre-
tions. For this purpofe let the patient drink plentifully o f diluting liquors; as
water-gruel, or oatmeal-tea, clear whey, barley-water, baum-tea, apple-tea; which
may be fharpened with juice o f orange, jelly o f currants, rafpberries, and fuch like.
I f the patient be coftive, an ounce o f tamarinds, with two ounces o f ftoned raifins
o f the fun, and a couple o f figs, may be boiled in three Englifh pints o f water to a
quart. T his makes a very pleafant drink, and may be ufed at diferetion. T h e pa­
tient’s diet muft be very fpare and lig h t; and it will afford him great re lie f efpe-
cially in a hot feafon, to have frefh air frequently let into his chamber. T h is, how­
ever, muft be done in fuch a manner as not to endanger his catching cold. It is too
common in fevers to load the patient with bed-clothes, under the pretence o f m aking
him fweat, or defending him from the cold. T h is cuftom has many ill effects. It
34, J i increafes
122
incrcafes the heat o f the body, fatigues the patient, and retards, inftead o f promot­
ing, the perfpiration. In this and all other fevers, attended with a hard, fu ll, qu ick,
pulfe, Weeding is o f the greateft importance. T h is operation ought always to be
performed as loon as the fymptoms o f an inflammatory fever appear. T h e quantity
o f blood to be taken away m ult be in proportion to the ftrength o f the patient and
the violence o f the difeale. I f after the firft bleeding the fever fhould rife, and the
pulfe become more frequent and hard, there will be a neccffity for repeating it a fe-
cond, and perhaps a third, or even a fourth, time, which may be done at thediftance
o f twelve, eighteen, or twenty-four, hours from each other, as the fymptoms require,
k ' the pulfe continues foft, and the patient is tolerably eafy after the firft bleeding,
it ought not to be repeated. I f the heat and fever be very great, forty or fifty drops
o f the dulcified or fweet fpiric o f nitre may be m ade into a draught, with an ounce
o f role-water, two ounces o f common water, and h a lf an ounce o f fimple fyrup, o r a
hit o f loaf-fugar. T h is draught may be given to the patient every three orfour hours,
while the fever is violent; afterwards, once in five or fix hours w ill be fuffictenc.
I f about the tenth, eleventh, or tw elfth, day, the pulfe becomes more loft, the
tongue moifter, and the urine begins to let fall a reddifh lettlement, there is rcafon
to expett a favourable iflfue to the difeafe. B ut if, inftead o f thefc fymptoms, the
patient’s fpirits grew languid, his pulfe finks, and his breathing becomes difficult,
with a ftupor, trem bling o f the nerves, ftartiog o f the tendons, & c . there is reafon to
fear that the confequences will be fatal. In this cafe blifters m uft be applied to the
head, ancles, infide o f the legsor thighs, as there m ay be occafion; poultices o f wheat-
bread, m uftard, and vinegar, may likewife be applied to the loles o f the feet, and
the patient m uft be fupported with cordials, as ftrong white-wine whey, negus,
fago-gruel with wine in it, and foch like. Should the patient recover, he ought to
take fome gentle laxative. A n ounce o f tam arinds, and a drachm o f fena m ay be
boiled for a few minutes in a pint o f water, and an ounce o f manna difiolved in the
deco& ion; afterwards it may be (trained, and a tea-cup full drunk every hour till
it operates. T h is dofe may be repeated twice or thrice, five or fix days intervening
betwixt each, and the patient fhould be kept eafy till his ftrength and fpirits are fuf-
ficicntly recruited.

T H E pleurify is an inflammation o f that membrane called the pleura, which lines
the infide o f the breaft- It may beoccaftoned by w hateverobftru& s the perfpiration:
as cold northerly winds*, drinking cold liquors when the body is hot; deeping with­
out doors on the dam p ground; wet clothes; plunging the body into cold water,
or e x i t in g it to the cold air, when covered with fweat, & c. It may likewife be oc-
cafioned

cartoned by drinking ftrong liquors ; by the ftoppagc o f ufual evacuations; as old
ulcers, iflues, fw catingof the feet or hands, & c. the fudden ftriking in o f any erup­
tion, as the itch, the mealies, or the fmall-pox. A pleurifym ay likewife be occartoned
by violent exercife,as running, wreftling, leaping, or by fupporting great weights,
blows on the breaft, & c. T h e pulfe in this difeafe is commonly quick and hard, the
urine high-coloured; and if blood be let it is covered with a tough cruft, or buffy
coat. T h e patient’s fpittle is at firft thin, but afterwards it becomes grofier, and i’i
often ftreaked with blood.
C U R E .— Nature generally endeavours to carry o ff this difeafe by a critical dif-
charge o f blood from fome part o f the body, by expectoration, fwcat, ioofe ftools,
thick urine, or the like. W e ought therefore to fecond her intentions by lettering
the force o f the circulation, relaxing the vettels, diluting the humours, and promot­
ing expectoration. Copious bleeding, in the beginning o f a pleurify, has a much
better effect than repeated fmall bleedings. A man may lofe twelve or fourteen ounces
o f blood as foon as it is certainly known that he is feized with a pleurify. For a
younger perfon, or one o f a delicate conftitution, the quantity m ud belcfs. If, after
the firft bleeding, the ftitch, with the other violent fymptoms, fhould continue, it
will be necettary, at the diftance o f twelve or eighteen hours, to let eight or nine
ounces more. I f the fymptoms do not then abate, and the blood (hews a ftrong
buffy coat, a third, or even a fourth, bleeding may be requifite. But this operation
is feldom necettary after the third or fouith day o f the fever, and ought not then to be
performed, unlefs in the m od urgent circumftances. T h e blood may be attenuated
without bleeding; and the pain o f the fide abated by fomenting, bliftering, & c. Fo­
mentations may be made by boiling a handful o f the flowers o f elder, camomile, and
common mallows, or any other foft vegetables, recommended for this complaint in
the Herbal. T h e herbs m ay be either put into a flannel bag, and applied warm to
the fide, or flannels may be dipped in the decoCtion, afterwards wrung out, and
applied to the part affected, with as much warmth as the patient can eafily bear. F o­
mentations not only eafe the pain, but relax the vefiels, and prevent the ftagnation
o f the blood and other humours. Leaves o f various plants might likewife be ap­
plied to the patient’s fide with advantage. I have often feen great benefit from young
cabbage-leaves applied warm to the fide in a pleurify. T hefe not only relax the
parts, but likewife draw o ff a little moifture, and may prevent the neceffity o f blif-
ttting plafters; which, however, when other things fail, m uft be applied. W h at is
called the crifis, or height o f the fever, is fometimes attended with very alarming
fymptoms, as difficulty o f breathing, an irregular pulfe, convulfivc motions, & c.
T hefe are apt to frighten the attendants, and induce them, to do improper tilings, as
bleeding the patient, giving him ftrong ftimulating medicines, or the like. B ut they
are
*24
are only the ftruggles o f N ature to overcome the difeafe, in which (he ought to be
affifted by plenty o f diluting drink, which is then peculiarly neceflary. I f the pa­
tient's ftrength however be m uch exhaufted by the difeafe, it will be neceffary at
this time to fupport him with fmall draughts o f white-wine whey, negus, or the like.
W hen the pain and fever are gone, it will be proper, after the patient has recover­
ed fufficient ftrength, to give him fome gentle purges. H e ought likewife to ufe a
light diet o f eafy digeftion, and his drink (hould be o f a cleanfing nature.
T h e perapbrentis, or inflammation o f the diaphragm , is fo nearly connected with
the pleurify, and refemblcs it fo much in the manner o f treatment, that it is fcarce
neceiTary to confider it as a feparate difeafe. It is attended with a very acute fever,
and an extreme pain o f the part affefted, which is generally augmented by coughing,
freezing, drawing in the breath, taking food, going to (tool, m aking water, & c.
H ence the patient breathes q u ick, and draws in his bowels to prevent the motion o f
the diaphragm ; is reftlefs, anxious, has a dry cough, a hiccup, and often a delirium.
E very method (hould be taken to prevent a fuppuration, as it is impofiible to lave
the patient’s life when this happens. T h e regimen and medicine are in all refpeCfcs
the fame as in the pleurify. W e (hall only add, that in this difeafe emollient clyfters
are peculiarly ufeful, as they relax the bowels, and by that means make a deriva­
tion from the part afFedted.
O f I N F L A M M A T I O N S o f t h e LUNGS.
T H I S difeafe is generally fatal to thofe who have a flat breaft, or narrow cheft,
and to fuch as are affli&ed with an afthma, efpecially in the decline o f life. Som e­
times the inflammation reaches to one lobe o f the lungs only, at other times the
whole organ is affetted; in which cafe the difeafe can hardly fail to prove fatal. A n
inflammation o f the lungs is fometimes a primary difeafe, and fometimes it is the
confequence o f other difeafes, as a quinfey, a pleurify, & c. M oft o f the fymptoms
o f a pleurify likewife attend an inflammation o f the lun gs; only in the latter the
pulfe is more foft, and the pain lefs acute; but the difficulty o f breathing, and op-
preflion o f the breaft, are generally greater.
C U R E .— Bleeding and purging are generally proper at the beginning o f this d if­
eafe ; but, if the patient’s fpittle is pretty thick, as well as concoCted, neither o f them
are neceiTary. It w ill be fufficient to affift the expectoration by fome o f the (harp
medicines recommended for that purpofe in the p leu rify; blifters ought to be ap­
plied pretty early. I f the patient does not fpit, he m ult be bled according as his
ftrength will permit, and have a gentle purge admin iftered. Afterwards his body
m ay be kept open by clyfters, and the expectoration prom oted, by taking every fou r
hours two table-fpoonfuls o f the folution o f gu m ammoniac, with oxym el o f

Squills, & c . W hen an inflammation o f the breaft does not yield to bleeding, blis­
tering, and other evacuations, it commonly ends in a fuppuration, which is more or
lefs dangerous according to the part where it is Situated. W hen this happens in the
pleura, it Sometimes breaks outwardly, and the matter is discharged from the
wound. I f the Suppuration happens within the fubftance or body o f the lungs, the
matter may be difeharged by expectoration; but, if the matter floats in the cavity
o f the breaft, between the pleura and the lungs, it can only be difeharged by an in-
cifion made betwixt the ribs. I f the patient’s ftrengch does not return after the in­
flammation is to all appearance removed; if his pulfe continues quick though Soft,
his breathing difficult and opprefled; if he has cold fhiverings at times, his cheeks
flufhed, his lips d ry ; and if he complains o f thirft, and want o f appetite; there is
reaSon to fear a fuppuration, and that a consumption o f the lungs will enfue; the
proper treatment o f which w e Shall next conSider.
O f C O N S U M P T I O N S .
C O N S U M P T IO N S prevail more in England than in any other part o f the
w orld; owing perhaps to the great ule o f animal food and m altdiquors, the general
application to Sedentary employments, and the great quantity o f pit coal which is
bu rn t; to which we may add the perpetual changes in the atmofphere, or variable-
nefs of the weather. A s this difeafe So frequently proves fatal, we Shall point out
its caufes, in order that people may as much as pofllble endeavour to guard againft
i t : thefe are, confined or unwholefome a ir; violent paffions, exertions, or affec­
tions o f the mind ; grief, disappointment, anxiety, or clofe application to ftudy :—
great evacuations; as Sweating, diarrhoeas, diabetes, exceffive venery, the fluor al-
bus, an over discharge o f the menftrual flux, giving fuck too lo n g :— alfo the Sud­
den ftoppage o f cuflomary evacuations; as the bleeding piles, fweating o f the feet,
bleedingatthe nofe, the menfes, iffues, ulcers, or eruptions o f any kind. Con-
Sumptions arelikewife caught by fleeping with the difeafed ; for which reafon this
thould be carefully avoided; but more consumptive patients date the beginning o f
their disorders from wet feet, damp beds, night air, wet clothes, or catching cold
after the body has been heated, than from all other caufes put together. T his dif­
eafe however is Sometimes ow ing to an hereditary taint, or a fcrophulous habit; in
which cafe it is generally incurable— yet, let none defpair,
C U R E .— On the firft appearance o f a confumption, if the patient lives in any
place where the air is confined, he ought immediately to qu it it, and to make choice
o f a Situation in the country, where the air is pure and free. H ere he muft not
remain inactive, but take every day as much exercife as he can bear. It is a pity
thok who attend theSick Seldom recommend riding in this difeafe, till the patient
34* K k is
126
is either unable to bear it, or the malady has becom e incurable : patients are like-
wile apt to trifle with themfelves. T h ey cannot fee how one o f the common actions
o f life fhould prove a remedy in an obftioate difeafe, and therefore they reject it,
while they greedily hunt after relief from medicine, merely becaufe they do not
underftand ic. N ext to proper air and exercife, a due attention Ihould be paid to
diet, which ought to be calculated to leflen the acrimony o f the humours, and to
nourifh and fupport the patient. F or this purpofe he fhould keep chiefly to-the
ufe o f vegetables and m ilk. M ilk alone is o f more value in this difeafe than the
whole materia mediea. AfTcs m ilk is commonly reckoned preferable to any other ;
but it cannot always be obtained ; befides, it is generally taken in very fmall quan­
tity ; whereas, to produce any effects, ito u g h tto m ake a conflderable part o f the
patient’s food. Some extraordinary cures in confumptive cafes have been perform ­
ed by women’s m ilk ; and, could it be obtained in fulHcient quantity, we w ould re­
commend it in preference to any other. It is better if the patient can fu ck it from
the bread, than to drink it afterwards. A man who was reduced to fuch a d e g reeo f
weaknefs in a confumption, as not to be able to turn in bed, fucked his w ife’s
breads, not with a view to reap any advantage from the m ilk, but to m ake her eafy.
Finding him felf however greatly benefited by it, he continued to lu ck her till he
became perfectly w ell, and is at prefent a ftrongand healthy man. Some prefer but­
ter-m ilk to any other, and it is indeed a very valuable medicine, if the dom ach be
able to bear it. It does not agree with every perfon at fir d ; and is therefore often
laidafide without a fufficient trial. It fhould at flrd be taken fparingly and the
quantity gradually increafed, until it comes to be almoft the foie food. I never
knew it fucceed unlels where the patient alm od lived upon it. W holefom e air,
proper exercife, and a diet confident therewith, is the only courfe that can be de­
pended on in a beginning confumption. I f the patient has ftrengch and fufficient
refolution to perfift in fuch a courfe, he w ill feldom be difappointed o f a cure. In
the flrd Aage o f a confumption, the cough may fom etimesbeappeafed by bleeding;
and the expectoration may be promoted by the follow ing medicines. T a k e frefh
fquills, gum -am m oniac, and powdered cardamum feeds, o f each a quarter o f an
ounce; beat them together in a mortar, and, if the mafs proves too hard for p ills,
a little o f any kind o f fyrup may be added to it. T h is may be formed into pills o f
a moderate fize, and four or five o f them taken tw ice or thrice a-day, according as
the patient’s dom ach w ill bear them. A m ixture made o f equal parts o f lemon-
ju ice, fine-honey, and fyrup o f poppies, may likew ifc be ufed. F ou r ounces o f each
o f thefc may be fimmered together in a faucepan, over a gentle fire, and a table-
fpoonful o f it taken at any time when the cough is troublefome. It is common
in this d age o f the difeafe to load the patient’s dom ach with oily and balfatnic me-
i diciaes.

dicines. Thefe, inftead o f rem oving the caufe o f the difeafe, tend rather to increafe
it, by heating the blood* while they pall the appetite, relax the folids, and prove
every way hurtful to the patient. W hatever is ufed for removing the cough, be-
fides riding and other proper regimen, ought to be medicines o f a lharp and cleanf-
ing nature*, as oxym el, fyrup o f lemon, & c ; For the patient’s drink we would re­
commend infufions o f the bitter plants mentioned in the H erbal, fuch as ground-
ivy, the imaller centaury, camomile flowers, water trefoil, & c. Thefe infufions may
be drunk at pleafure. T h ey ftrengthen the ftomach, promote digeftion, rectify the
blood, and at the fame time anfwer all the purpofes o f dilutition, and quench thirft
much better than things that are lufeious or fweet. B ut, if the patient fpits blood,
he ought to ufe, for his ordinary drink, infufions or decoctions o f the vulnerary
roots, plants, & c. There are many other mucilaginous plants and feeds o f a heal­
ing and agglutinating nature, recommended in the H erbal, from which decoftions
or infufions may be prepared with the fame intention * as the orches, the quince-
feed, coltsfoot, linfeed, farfaparilla, See. T h e conferve o f rofes is here peculiarly
proper. It may either be put into the decoftion above preferibed, or eaten by it-
felf. N o benefit is to be expected from trifling dofes o f this medicine. It feldom
proves o f any fervice, unlefs three or four ounces at leaft are ufed daily for a confi-
derable time. In this way I have feen it produce very happy effects, and would
recommend it wherever there is a difeharge o f blood from the lungs. W hen the
fpitting up o f grofs matter, oppreflion o f the breaft, and the heCttc fymptoms, fhew
that an impofthume is formed in the lungs, the Peruvian bark is the only drug which
has any chance to counteract the general tendency which the humours then have to
putrefaction. A n ounce o f it in powder may be divided into eighteen or twenty
dofes, c f which one may be taken every three hours through the day, in a little fy­
rup, or a cup o f horehound tea. W e would not recommend the bark while there
are any fymptoms o f an inflammation o f the breaft* but, -when it is certainly known
that matter is collected there, it is one o f the beft medicines which can be ufed.
Few patients indeed have refolution enough to give the bark a fair trial at this '
period o f the difeafe, otherwife we have reafon to believe that great benefit might be
reaped from it.
A N E R V O U S C O N S U M P T I O N is aw aitin g or decay o f the whole body,
without any confiderable degree o f fever, cough, or difficulty o f breathing. It is
attended with indigeftion, weaknefs, and wane o f appetite, & c . T hole who are o f
a fretful temper, who indulge in fpirituous liquors, or who breathe an unwholefome
air, are moft liable to this difeafe. W e would recommend, for the cure o f a nervous
confumption, aligh t and nourifhing dier, plenty o f exercife in a free open air, and
the ufe c f fuch bitters as brace and ftrengthen the ftomach* as the Peruvian bark,
gentian
128
gentian root, camomile* horehound, & c . T hefe may be infufed in water or wine,
and a glafs o f it drunk frequently. Agreeable amufements, cheerful company, and
riding about, are preferable to all medicines in this difeafe. F o r which reafon, when
the patient can afford it, we would recommend a long journey o f pleafure, as the
m oft likely means to reftore his health. W h at is called afymptomatic confumption can­
not be cured without firft rem oving the difeafe by which it is occafioned. T h u s,
when a confumption proceeds from the fcrophula or king's-evil, from the fcurvy, the
afthma, the venereal difeafe, & c . a due attention m uft be paid to the malady from
whence it arifes, and the regimen and medicine directed accordingly. W hen ex-
ccfiivc evacuations o f any kind occafion a confumption, they m ud not only be re-
ftrained, but the patient’s ftrength m uft be reftored by gentle exercife, nourifhing
diet, and generous cordials. Y o u n g and delicate mothers often fall into confum p-
tions by giving fuck too long. A s foon as they perceive their ftrength and appetite
begin to fail, they ought immediately to wean the child, or provide another nurfe,
otherwife they cannot exp eft a cure.
O f t h e S L O W o r N E R V O U S F E V E R .
N E R V O U S F E V E R S may be occasioned by w hatever deprefles the fpirits, or
impoverishes the blood j as grief, fear, anxiety, want o f fleep, intenfe thought, livin g
on poor watery diet, unripe fruits, cucum bers, melons, mufhrooms, & c. T h ey m ay
likewife be occafioned by damp, confined, or unwholefome, air. H ence they are
very common in rainy feafons, and prove m oft fatal to thofe who live in dirty, low ,
houfes, crowded Streets, hofpitals, ja ils, orfuch-like places. Perlons whofe constitu­
tions have been broken by excefTive venery, frequent falivations, too free an ufe o f
purgative medicines, or any other excefliveevacuations, are very liable to this difeafe.
C U R E .— T h e patient muft not be kept too low. H is ftrength and fpirits ought
to be fupported by nourilhingdiet and cordials. F o r this purpofe his gruel, panada,
or whatever food he takes, m uft be mixed with wine according as the fymptoms m ay
require. Pretty ftrong white-wine whey, or fmall negus, Sharpened with the ju ice
o f orange or lemon, w ill be proper for his ordinary drink. W here a naufea, load,
and ficknefs at ftom ach, prevail at the beginning o f a fever, it w ill be neceffary to give
the patient a gentle vom it. Fifteen or twenty grains o f ipecacuanha in fine powder
w ill generally anfwer this purpofe very well. T h is may be repeated any time before
the third or fourth day, if the above fymptoms continue. Vom its not only clean the
ftom ach, but, by the general (hock which they g iv e, promote the perforation, and
have many other excellent effects in flow fevers, where there are no figns o f inflamma­
tion, and nature wants roufing. Such as dare not venture upon a vom it, may clean the
bowels by a fmall dole o f T u rk ey rhubarb, or infufion o f fenna and manna. In all
fevers,
C U L P E P E R ' S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N .
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 129
fevers, the great point is to regulate the fymptoms, fo as to prevent them from going
to either extreme. T h u s, in fevers o f the inflammatory kind, where the force o f
the circulation is too great, or the blood denfe, and the fibres too rigid, bleeding and
other evacuations are necefiary. B ut, in nervous fevers, where nature flags, where
the blood is vapid and poor, and the folids relaxed, the lancet muft be fpared, and
wine, with other cordials, plentifully adminiftered. T h o u gh bleeding is generally
improper in this difeafe, yet bliftering is highly necefiary. Blitters m aybe applied
at all times o f the fever with great advantage. I f the patient is delirious, he ought
to be bliftered on the neck or head *
, and it will be the fafeft courfe, while the infen-
fibilicy continues, as foon as the difcharge occafioned by one blitter abates, to apply
another to fome other part o f the body, and by that means keep up a continual fuc-
cefiion o f them till he be out o f danger. A miliary eruption fometimes breaks out
about the ninth or tenth day. A s eruptions are often critical, great care fhould be
taken not to retard Nature’s operation in this particular. T h e eruption ought nei­
ther to be checked by bleeding nor other evacuations, nor pufhed out by a hot
regim en; but the patientfhouldbe fupported by gentle cordials,as wine-whey, (mail
negus, fago-gruel with a little wine in it, and fuch like. H e ought not to be kept
too warm yet akindly breathing fweat fhould by no means be checked. In def-
perate cafes, where the hiccup and ftarting o f the tendons have already come on, we
have fometimes feen extraordinary effe&s from large dofes o f m ufk frequently
repeated. M ufk is doubtlefs an antifpafmodic, and may be given to the quantity o f
a fcruple three or four times a-day, or oftener if necefiary. Sometimes it may be
proper to add to the musk a few grains o f camphire, and fait o f hartfhorn, as thefe
tend to promote perfpiration and the difeharge o f urine. T h u s fifteen grains o f
musk, with three grains o f camphire, and fix grains o f fait o f hartfhorn, may be
made into a bolus with a little fyrup, and given as above. I f the fever fhould inter­
mit, which it frequently does toward thedecline, or if the patient’s ftrength fhould
be watted with colliquative fweats, & c. it w ill be necefiary to give him the Peruvian
bark. H a lf a drachm, ora whole drachm if the ftomach will bear it, o f the bark in
fine powder, may be given four or five times a-day, in a g la fso f red port or claret.
Should the bark in fubftancenot ficeafy on the ftomach, an ounce o f it in powder
may be infufed in a bottle o f Lifbon or Rhenifh wine for two or three days j after­
wards it may be ftrained, and a glafs o f it taken frequently.
O f the M A L I G N A N T , P U T R I D , or. S P O T T E D , F E V E R .
T H I S fever is occafioned by foul air, from a number o f people being confined
in a narrow place, not properly ventilated * from putrid animat and vegetable ef­
fluvia, & c . Hence it prevails in camps, jails, hofpitals, and infirmaries, efpccially
34* L l where
where fuch places are too m uch crowded, and cleanlinefs is negleCfed. Putrid, m a­
lignant, or fpotted, fevers, are highly infectious *
, and are therefore often com m uni­
cated by contagion. F o r which reafon all perfons ought to keep at a diftance from
thofe affeCted with fuch dileafes, unlefs their attendance is abfolucely neceflary. P u ­
trid fevers may be diftinguifhed from the inflammatory by the fmallnefs o f the
pulfe, the great dejettion o f m ind, the dilTolved date o f the blood, the petechias, or
purple fpots, and the putrid fmell o f the excrements. T h ey may likewife be dif-
tinguifhed from the low or nervous fever by the heat and third being greater, the
urine o f a higher colour, and the lofs o f drength, dejeCtion o f mind, and all the
other fym ptom s, more violent.
C U R E .— T h e duration o f putrid fevers is extrem ely uncertain ; fometimes they
terminate betwixt the feventh and fourteenth day, and at other times they are pro­
longed for five or fix weeks. T h eir duration depends greatly upon the conditution
o f the patient, and the manner o f treating the difeafe; in which we ought to endea­
vour, as much as poflible, to counteract the putrid tendency o f the humours ; to
fupporr the patient’s drength and fpirits; and to aflift nature in expelling the caufe
o f the difeafe, by gently prom oting perfpiration and the other evacuations. Befides
the frequent admiffion o f frefh air, which is extrem ely neceflary, we would recom ­
mend the ufe o f vinegar, verjuice,-juice o f lemon, Seville orange, or any kind o f
vegetable acid that can be m od readily obtained. T h efe ought frequently to be
fprinkled upon the floor,.the bed, and every part o f the room. T h e frefh fkins o f
lemons or oranges ought likewife to be laid in different parts o f the room, and they
fhould be frequently held to the patient’s nofe. T h e ufe o f acids in this manner
■ would not only prove very refrefhing to the patient, but would likewife tend to pre--
vent the infcCHon from fpreading among thofe who attend him. Strong-fcented
herbs, as rue, tanfy, rofemary, wormwood, & c . may likewife be laid in different
parts o f the houfe, and fmelled to by thofe who g o near the patient. I f a vom it
be given at the beginning o f this fever, it will hardly ever fail to have a good effeCl;
but, if the fever has gone on for fome days, and the fymptoms are violent, vom its
are not fo fafe. T h e body however is always to be kept gently open by clyders,
or mild laxative medicines. Bleeding is feldom neceffary in putrid fevers. I f there
be figns o f an inflammation, it may fometimes be permitted at the fird onfet; but
the repetition o f it generally proves hurtful. Bliders are never to be u fed unlefs in
the greated extremities. I f the petechias or fpots fhould fuddenly difappear, the
patient’s pulfe fink rem arkably, and a delirium, with other bad fymptoms, com e on,
buffering may be permitted. In this cafe the bliders are to be applied to the head,
and infide o f the legs or thighs. B ut, as they are fometimes apt to occafion a gan­
grene, we would rather recommend warm cataplafms or poultices o f mudard and
2 vinegar
i3o C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . *3 *
vinegar to be applied to the feet, having recourfe to bliflers only in the utmoft ex­
tremities. It is common in the beginning o f this fever to give the emetic tartar in
fmall dofes, repeated every fecond or third hour, till it fhall either vom it, purge, or
throw the patient into a fweat. T h is practice is very proper, provided it be not
pulhed fo far as to weaken the patient. In the m od dangerous fpecies o f this difeafe,
when it is attended with purple, livid, or black, fpots, the Peruvian bark fhould be
adminiftered; it m ult not only be given in large dofes, but be duly perfifted in.
T h e belt method o f adminiftering it is certainly in fubitancej but, for thofe who
cannot take it in fubftance, it m ay be infufed in wine. F o r preventing putrid fevers
w e would recommend a ftri£t regard to cleanllnefs, a dry fituation, fufficient exer-
cife in the open air-, wholcfome food, and a moderate ufe o f generous liquors* In­
fection ought above all things to be avoided. N o conftitution is proof againft i t ;
and when a putrid fever feizes any perfon in a fam ily, the greatelt attention is necef-
fary to prevent the difeafe from fpreading. A nyone, w ho is apprehenfive o f having
caught the infection, ought immediately to take a vom it, and to w ork it o ff by
drinking plentifully o f camomile-tea. T h is may be repeated in a day or tw o, if the
apprehenfions ftill continue, or any unfavourable fymptoms appear.

SO called, from the fmall puftules or bladders which appear on the fkin, refem-
bling, in fhape and fize, the feeds o f millet. T h e puftules are either red or white,
and fometimes both are mixed together. It chiefly attacks the idle and the phleg­
matic, or perfons o f a relaxed habit. T h e young and the aged are more liable to it
than chofe in the vigour and prime o f life. It is likewife more incident to women
than men, efpecially the delicate and the indolent, who, neglecting exercife, keep
continually within doors, and live upon weak watery diet. Such females are e x ­
tremely liable to be feized with this difeafe in childbed, and often lofe their lives by
it. W hen this is a primary difeafe, it makes its attack, like m od other eruptive
fevers, with a flight fhivering, which is fucceeded by heat, lofs o f flrength, a low
quick pulfe, difficulty o f breathing, with great anxiety and oppreffion o f the breaft;
and in child-bed women the m ilk generally goes away, and the other difeharges ftop.
C U R E .— Sometimes the miliary fever approaches towards a putrid nature, in
which cafe the patient's ftrength muft be fupported with generous cordials, joined
with acids; and, if the degree o f putrefcence be great, the Peruvian bark muft be
adminiftered. I f the head be much affe&ed, the body m uft be kept open by emol­
lient clyfters. I f the food and drink be properly regulated, there will be little occa-
fton for medicine. W here nature flags, and the eruption comes and goes, it may
be necefTary to keep u p a ftimulus, by a continual fucceffion o f fmall bliftering
piafters
plafters; but we w ould not recommend above one at a time. I f however the pulfe
fhould fink rem arkably, the puftules fall in, and the head be affedted, it will be ne-
ceffary to apply feveral blifters to the moft fenfible parts, as the infide o f the k g s
and thighs, & c . Bleeding is feldom neceffary in this difeafe, and fometimes it does
m uch hurt, as it weakens the patient, and depreffes his fpirits. I f the difeafe proves
tedious, or the recovery flow, we would recommend the Peruvian back, which may
either be taken in fubftance, or infufed in wine or water as the patient inclines. T o
avoid this difeafe, a pure dry air, fufficient exercife, and wholefom c food, are necef-
fary. Pregnant women fhould guard againft coftfvenefs, and take daily as m uch ex­
ercife as they can bear, avoiding all green fruits, and other unwholefbme things 5
and, when in child-bed, they ought ftri&ly to obferve a cool regimen.
O r t h e R E M I T T I N G F E V E R .
T H I S fever takes its name from a remiffion o f the fymptoms, which happens
fometimes fooner, and fometimes later, but generally before the eighth day. T h e
remiffion is commonly preceded by a gentle fweat, after which the patient feems
greatly relieved, but in a few hours the fever returns. Thefe remiffions return at
very irregular periods, and are fometimes o f longer, fometimes o f fhorter, duration;
the nearer however that the fever approaches to a regular intermittent, the danger is
thelefs. T h ey are m od frequent in clofe calm weatner, efpecially after rainy fea-
fons, great inundations, or the like. N o age, fex, or confticution, is exempted
from the attack o f this fe v e r: but it chiefly feizes perfons o f a relaxed habit, who
live in low dirty habitations, breathe an impure ftagnated air, take little exercife,
and ufe unwholefome diet. T h e firft fymptoms o f this fever are pains and gkldinefs
in the head, with alternate fits o f heat and cold. T h e pulfe is fometimes a little
hard, but feldom fu ll, and the blood, when let, rarely fhews any figns o f inflamma­
tion. In order to cure this fever, endeavours fhould be ufed to bring it to a regular
intermiffion. T h is intention may be promoted by bleeding, if there be any figns
o f inflammation *
, b u t, when that is not the cafe, bleeding ought by no means to be
attem pted, as it w ill weaken the patient, and prolong the difeafe. A vom it how­
ever will feldom be improper, and is generally o f great fervice. T w en ty or thirty
grains o f ipecacuanha will anfwer this purpofe very well 5 but, where it can be ob­
tained, we would rather recommend a grain or two o f emetic tartar, with five or fix
grain sof ipecacuanha, to bemade intoadraught, and given fo ra vom it. T h is may
be repeated once or twice at proper intervals, if the ficknefs or naufea continues.
T h e body ought to be kept open either by differs or gentle laxatives, as w eak in-
fufionsof fenna and manna, fmall dofes o f the lenitive eleftuary, cream o f tartar,
tamarinds, ftewed prunes, or the like j but all ftrongor draftic purgatives are to be
avoided,

avoided. B y this courle the fever in a few days may generally be brought to a pretty
regular or diftinft intermiflion, in which cafe, the Peruvian bark may be adminifter-
ed, and it will feldom fail to perfect the cure.

T H E fmall-pox is commonly caught by infection. Since the diieafe was firft
brought from A rabia into Europe, the infection has never been wholly extinguilhed ;
nor have any proper methods been taken for that purpofe; fo that now it has be­
come in a manner conftitutional. Children who have over-heated themfelves by
running, wreftling, & c. or adults after a debauch, are moft apt to be feized with the
fmall-pox. T h e difeafe is fo generally known, that a minute defeription o f it is
unneceffary. Children commonly look dull, feem liftlefs and drowfy, for a few days
before the more violent fymptoms o f the fmall-pox appear. T h ey arc likewife
more inclined to drink than ufoal, have little appetite for folid food, complain o f
wearinefs, and, upon taking exercife, are apt to fweat. T hefe are fucceded by flight
fits o f heat and cold in turns, which, as the time o f the eruption approaches, become
more violent, and are accompanied with pains o f the head and loins, vom iting, & c.
T h e pulfe is quick, with a great heat o f the Ikin, and reftleflnefs. W hen the patient
drops afleep, he wakes in a kind o f horror, with a fudden ftart, which is a very com ­
mon fymptom o f the approaching eruption; as are alfo convulfion-fits in very
young children. T h e moft favourable fymptoms are a flow eruption, and an abate­
ment o f the fever as foon as the puftules appear. In a m ild diftinlt kind o f fmall-
pox, the puftules feldom appear before the fourth day from the time o f fickening,
and they generally keep coming out gradually for feveral days after. Puftules
which are diftinft, with a florid red bafis, and which fill with thick purulent mat­
ter, firft o f a whitifh, and afterwards o f a yellowifh, colour, are the beft. It is a
moft unfavourable fymptom when petechias, or purple, brown, or black, fpots, are
interfperfed among the puftules. Thefe arefigns o f a putrid diflolution o f the blood,
and fhew the danger to be very great. Bloody ftools, or urine, with a fwelled belly,
are bad fymptoms; as is alfo a continual ftranguary. Pale urine and a violent throb­
bing of the arteries o f the neck are figns o f an approaching delirium, or o f convul­
fion-fits. W hen the face does not fwell, or falls before the pock comes to maturity,
it is very unfavourable. I f the face begins to fall about the eleventh or twelfth
day, and at the fame time the hands and feet begin to fwell, the patient generally
does well; but, when thefe do not fucceed to each other, there is a reafon to appre­
hend danger.
C U R E .— A ll that is necefiary, during the eruptive fever, is to keep the patient
cool and eafy, allowing him to drink freely o f fome w eak diluting liquors; as
35. M m baum-
baum-tea, barley-water, clear whey, gruel's, & c . M u ch m ifehief is done at this
period by confining the patient to his bed, and plying him with warm cordials or
fudorific medicines. E very thing that heats and inflames the blood increafes the
fever, and pufhes out the puftules prematurely. T h is has numberlefs ill effe&s.
It not only increafes the number o f puftules, but likewife tends to m ake them run
into one another; and, when they have been pufhed out with too great violence,
they generally fall in before they com e to m aturity. T h e food ought to be very
ligh t, and o f a cooling nature, as panada, or bread boiled with equal quantities o f
m ilk and water, good apples roafted or boiled with m ilk, and fweetened with a little
fugar or fuch like. T h e m od dangerous period o f this difeafe is what we call
the fecondary fever. T h is generally comes on when the pock begins to blacken
or turn on the face, and moft o f thofe who die o f the fm all-pox are carried o ff
b y this fever. N ature generally attempts, at the turn o f the fm all-pox, to relieve
the patient by loofe ftools. H er endeavours this way are by no means to be
counteracted, but prom oted; and the patient at the fame time fupported by food
and drink o f a nourifliing and cordial nature. If, at the approach o f the fecondary
fever, the pulfe be very qu ick, hard, and ftrong, the heat intenfe, and the breathing
laborious, with other fymptoms o f an inflammation o f the breaft, the patient m ult
immediately be bled. T h e quantity o f blood to be let m ud be regulated by the
patient's ftrength, age, and urgency o f the fym ptom s. B ut, in the fecondary
fever, if the patient be faintifh, the puftules become fuddenly pale, and if there be
great coldnefs o f the extrem ities, blifters muft be applied, and the patient m ult be
fupported with generous cordials. W ine and even fpirits have fometimes been
given in fuch cafes with amazing fuccefs. It is generally necdTary, after the fm all-
pox is gone off, to purge the patient. I f however the body has been open through
the whole courfe o f the difeafe, or if butter-m ilk and other things o f an opening na­
ture have been drunk freely after the height o f the fm all-pox, purging becomes
lefs neceffary ; but it ought never wholly to be negle<fted. For very young ch il­
dren, an infufton o f fenna and prunes, with a little rhubarb, may be fweetened with
coarfe fugar, and given in fmall quantities till it operates. T h ofe who are farther
advanced muft take medicines o f a lharper nature. F or exam ple, a child o f five
or fix years o f age m ay take eight or ten grains o f fine rhubarb in powder over
night, and the fame quantity o f jalap in powder next morning. T h is m ay be
wrought o ff with frefh broth or water gruel, and may be repeated three or four
times, five or fix days intervening betwixt each dofe. For children further ad­
vanced, and adults, the dofe muft be increafed in proportion to the age and confti-
tution. W hen a cough, a difficulty o f breathing, or other fymptoms o f a con-
fum ption, fucceed to the fm all-pox, the patient m uft be fent to a place where the air
is

Is good, and put upon a courle o f affes m ilk, with fuch other treatment as hath
already been directed in confumptions.
O f I N O C U L A T I O N .
T H I S falutary invention, which is the only effe&ual means o f (lopping the ravages
o f this difeafe, has been known in Europe above half a century ^ yet, like moft
ocher ufeful difcoveries, ft has, till o f late, made but flosv progrefs. N o dilcovery
can be o f general utility, while the pra&ice o f it is kept in the hands o f a few. T h e
fears, the jealoufies, the prejudices, and the oppofite interefts, of the faculty, are,
and ever will be, the moft effectual obftacles to the progrefs o f any falutary difeo-
very. Hence it is that the practice o f inoculation never became, in any meafure,
general, even in England, till taken up by men not bred to phytic. Thefe have
not only rendered the pra&ice m oreextenfive, but likewife more fafe, and, by a& ing
under lefs reftraint than the regular pra&itioners, have taught them that the patient’s
greateft danger arofe, not from the want o f medical care, but from the excefs o f it.
T h e prefent method o f inoculating in Britain, is to make tw o or three Hunting inci-
fions in the arm, fo fuperficial as not to pierce quite through the (kin, with a lancet
wet with frefli matter taken from a ripe puftule j afterwards the wounds are clofed
up, and left without any drefiing. Some make ufe o f a lancet covered with the dry
matter i but this is lefs certain, and ought never to be ufed unlefs where frelh mat­
ter cannot be obtained: when this is the cafe, the matter ought to be moiftened
by holding the lancet for fome time in the fteam o f warm water. W e do not find
that inoculation is at all confidered as a medical operation in foreign countries. In
T u rkey, whence we learned it, it is performed by the women, and in the Eaft Indies
by the brachmins or priefts. in this country, the cuftom , though ftill in its in­
fancy, has been pra&ifed by numbers o f the common people with aftonifhing fuc-
e'efs and, as the fmall-pox is now become an epidemical difeafe in moft parts o f
the known world, there feems no other choice left, but to render the malady as mild
as poflible. It is a matter o f fmall confequence, whether a difeafe be entirely
extirpated, or rendered fo m ild as neither to deftroy life nor hurt the conftitution 5
and that this may be done by inoculation, does not now admit o f a doubt. T h e
numbers who die under inoculation hardly deferve to be named. In the natural
way,one in four or five generally dies \but by inoculation not one o f a thoufand. N ay,
fome can boaft o f having inoculated ten thoufand without the lofs o f a fingle patient.
T h e moft proper age for inoculating children is betwixt three and five. T hole
who have conftitutional difeafes may neverthelefs be inoculated \ it will often
mend the habit o f body, but ought to be performed at a time when they are moft
healthy. Accidental difeafes Ihould always be removed before inoculation. It is
2 generally
generally thought neceflary to regulate the diet for fome time before the difeafe be
communicated. In children, however, great alteration in diet is feldom neceflary,
their food being com m only o f the moft fimple and wholefome kind, as m iik, water-
gruel, weak broths, bread, light pudding, mild roots, and white meats. W e would
recommend no other medicinal preparation than tw o or three mild purges, which
ought to be fuited to the age and ftrength o f the patient. T h e fuccefs o f inocula-
tors does not depend on the preparation o f their patients, but on their management
c l them while under the difeafe. T h eir conftant care fliould be to keep them cool,
and the;r bodies gently open, by which means the fever is kept low, and the eruption
greatly leflened. T h e danger is feldom great when the puftulcs are few *
, and their
number is generally in proportion to the fever which precedes and attends the erup­
tion. H ence the ch ief fecret o f inoculation coniifts in regulating theeruptive fever,
which generally may be kept fufficiently low by the methods mentioned above.
T h e regimen during the difeafe is in all refpe&s the fame as under the natural fm all-
pox. T h e patient m u ft be kept cool, his diet fhould be light, and his drink w eak
and diluting, & c . Should any bad fymptom appear, which is feldom the cafe, they
m uft be treated in the fame way as directed in the natural fmal)-pox. Purging is
not lefs neceflary after the fm all-pox by inoculation than in the natural way, and
ought by no means to be neglctted.
O f t h e M E A S L E S .
T H I S difeafe, like the fm all-pox, proceeds from infection, and is more or lefs dan­
gerous according to the conftitution o f the patient, the feafon o f the year, the cli­
mate, & c . It is ufually preceded by a fhort cough, a heavinefs o f the head and eyes,
drowfinefs, and a running at the nofe. T here is an inflammation and heat in the
eyes, with a defluxion o f fharp tears, vom iting, and great acutenefs o f fenfation,
fo that the patient cannot bear the light without pain. A bou t the fourth day, fmall
fpots, refembling flea-bites, appear, firft upon the face, then upon the breaft, and
afterwards on the extrem ities: thefe may be diftinguilhed from the fm all-pox by
their fcarcely rifing above the fkin. T h e fever, cough, and difficulty o f breathing,
inftead o f being removed by the eruption, as in the fm all-pox, are rather increafed;
but the vom iting generally ceafes. A b o u t the fixth or feventh day from the tim e
o f fickcning, the meafles begin to turn pale on the face, and afterwards upon the
body *
, fo that by the ninth day they entirely difappear. Such as die o f the meafles
generally expire about the ninth day from the invaflon, and are com m only carried o ff
by inflammation o f the lungs. T h e moft favourable fymptoms are, a moderate
loofenefs, a moift fkin, and a plentiful difehargeof urine. W hen the eruption fud-
denly falls in, and the patient is feized with a delirium , he is in the greateft danger.
I f
136 C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . *37
I f the meafles turn too foon o f a pale colour, it is an unfavourable fymptom, as are
alfb great weaknefs, vom iting, reftleflnefs, and difficulty o f fwallowing. Purple or
black fpots appearing am ong the meafles are very unfavourable. W hen a conti­
nual cough, with hoarfenefs, fucceeds the difeafe, there is reafon to fufpect an ap­
proaching confumption o f the lungs.
C U R E .— O ur bufinefs in this dileafe is to affift nature by proper cordials in
throwing outthe morbific matter, if her efforts be too languid *
, but when they are
too violent they muft be reftrained by evacuations, and cool diluting liquors, & c.
W e ought likewife to endeavour to appeafe the m od urgent fymptoms, as the
cough, reftleflnefs, and difficulty o f breathing. A cool regimen is neceflary here
as well as in the fmall-pox. T h e food coo m uft be light, and the drink diluting.
T h e m oftfuitable liquors are decodions o f liquorice with marfh-mallow roots and
farfaparilla, infufions o f linfeed, or o f the flowers o f elder, balm-tea, clarified whey,
barley-water, and fuch like. Bleeding is com m only neceflary, particularly when
the fever runs high, with difficulty o f breathing, and great oppreflion o f the breaft.
B u t, if the difeale be o f a m ild kind, bleeding may be om itted. I f at the turn o f
the difeafe the fever aflumes new vigour, and there appears great danger o f fuffoca-
tion, bleeding muft be repeated according to the patient’s ftrength, and blifters m uft
be applied, with a view to prevent the load from being thrown on the lungs, where
i f an inflammation fhould fix itfelf, the patient’s life w ill be in imminent danger. In
cafe the meafles fhould fuddenly difappear, the patient m uft be fupported with wine
and cordials. Blifters muft be applied to the legs and arm s, and the body rubbed
all over with warm flannels. Should a cough, with difficulty o f breathing, and
other fymptoms o f a confumption, remain after the meafles, fmall quantities o f
blood may be frequently let ac proper intervals, as the patient’s ftrength and confu­
tation will permit. H e ought likewife to drink afles m ilk, to remove to a free air,
and to ride daily on horfeback.
O f t h e S C A R L E T F E V E R ;
T H E fcarlet fever is fo called from the colour o f the patient’s fkin, which ap­
pears as if it were tinged with red wine. It begins, like other fevers, with coldnefs
and fhivering, without any violent ficknefs. Afterwards the skin is covered with
red fpots, which are broader, more florid, and lefs uniform, than the meafles. T h ey
continue two or three days, and then difappear j after which thecuticle, orfearf-skin,
falls off.
C U R E .— There is fcldom any occafion for medicine in this difeafe, unlefs it is
attended with putrid or malignant fymptoms, in which cafe it is always dangerous
the patient is then not only affeded with coldnefs and fhivering, but with languor,
35* N n ficknefs,
ficknefs, and great oppreluon *
, to thefe fuccced exceftive hear, naufea, and vom it­
ing, with a lbrenefs o f the throat j the pulfc is extremely qu ick, but finall and de-
prefled: the breathing frequent and laborious; the skin hot, but not quite dry >
the tongue m cift, and covered with a whitifh m ucus ; the tonlils inflamed and ul­
cerated. W hen the eruption appears, it brings no relief: on the contrary, the
fymptoms generally grow svorfe, and frefh ones com e on, as purging, delirium ,
6cc. Should this difeafe be miftaken for a Ample inflammation, and treated with
repeated bleedings, purging and cooling medicines, as is lometimes the cafe, it ge­
nerally proves fatal. T h e only medicines that can be depended on are cordials and
antifeptics, as the Peruvian bark, wine, fnake-root, and the like. T h e treatment
m ult be in general fim iiar to that o f the putrid fever, or o f the malignant ulcerous
ibre throat.
O p t h e B I L I O U S F E V E R ,
A C O N T I N U A L remitting or intermitting fever, accompanied with a copi­
ous evacuation o f bile, either by vom it or (tool, is denominated bilious. It generally
makes its appearance about the end o f fummer, and ceafes towards the approach
o f winter. It is moft fatal in warm countries, efpecially where the foil is m arlhy,
and when great rains are fucceeded byfultry heats. T hofe who work without doors,
and are expofed to the night air, are moft liable to this kind o f fever.
C U R E .— I f there are fymptoms o f inflammation, it w ill be neceflary to bleed,
and to put the patient upon cool diluting regimen, recommended in the inflamma­
tory fever. Saline draughts may likewife be frequently adminiftered, and the pa­
tient’s body kept open by clyftcrs or m ild purgatives. B u t, if the fever fhouldrem ic
or intermit, bleeding w ill feldom be neceflary. In this cafe a vom it may be admini­
ftered, and, if the body be bound, a gentle p u rg e; after which the Peruvian bark
w ill generally com plete the cure.
O f the E R Y S I P E L A S , or S t . A N T H O N Y ’ S F I R E .
T H E eryfipelas may be occafioncd by violent paflions or affeftions o f the
mind *
, as, fear, anger, & c. W hen the body has been heated to a great degree, and
is immediately expofed to the cold air, fo that the perforation is fuddenly checked,
an eryfipelas will often enfue. It may alfo be occafioned by drinking to excefs, by
continuing too long in a warm bath, or by any thing that over-heats the blood. I f
any o f the natural evacuations be obftru&ed, or in too fmall quantity, it may caufe
an eryfipelas. T h e fame eflfeft will follow from the fto p p a g eo f artificial evacua­
tions; asiflues, fetons, or the like. T h e diforder com es on with fhivering, thirft,
’ofs o f ftrength, pain in the head and back, hear, reftleflnefs, and a quick pulfe ; to
which

which may be added vom iting, and fometimcs a delirium. O n the fecond, third, or
fourth, day, the part fwells, becomes red, and fmall puftules appear: at which
time the fever generally abates. AYhen the eryfipelas is large, deep, and affects a
very fenfible part o f the body, the danger is great. I f the red colour changes into
a livid or black, it will end in a mortification. Sometimes the inflammation can­
not be difeuffed, but comes to a fuppuration ; in which.cafe fiflulas, a gangrene, or
mortification, often enl'ue. Such as die o f this difeafe arc commonly carried o ff by
the fever, which is attended with difficulty o f breathing, and fometimcs with a de-
l :rium and great drowfinefs. T h ey generally die about the feventh or eighth day.
C U R E .— In this complaint much m ilchief is often done by medicines, cfpecially
by external applications ♦>whereas the principal object fhould be to promote per-
fpiration, which has a great tendency to carry o ff the difeafe. It is common to bleed
in the eryfipelas *
, but this likewife requires caution. I f however the fever be high,
the pulfe hard and ftrong, and the patient vigorous, it w ill be proper to bleed *
, but
the quantity m ull be regulated by thefe circumftanccs, and the oi>eration re la te d
as the fyirptorr.s may require. I f the patient has been accuftomed toflron g liquots,
and the difeafe attacks his head, bleeding is abfolutely neceflary. Bathing the feet
and legs frequently in lukewarm water, when the difeafe attacks the face or brain,
has an excellent effect. It tends to make a derivation from the head, and feldom
fails to relieve the patient. W hen bathing proves incffcdlual, poultices, c r lharp
linapilms, may be applied to the foies o f the feet for the fame purpofe. In cafes
where bleeding is requifite, it is likewife necefiary to keep the body open. T his
may be effected by emollient clyfters, or fmall dofes o f nitre and rhubarb. Some
indeed recommend very large dofes o f nitre in the eryfipelas; but nitre feldom fits
eafy on the ftomach when taken in large dofes. It is however one o f the btft me­
dicines when the fever and inflammation run high. H a lf a drachm o f it, with four
or five grains o f rhubarb, may be taken in the patient’s ordinary drink, four times a
day. W hen the eryfipelas feizes the head, foas tooccafion a delirium orftupor, blit­
ters m ud be applied to the neck, or behind the ears, and ffiarp cataplafms laid to the
foies o f the feet. In what is commonly called the fcorbutic er)j/pe!as, which con­
tinues for a confiderable time, it will only be neceffary to give gentle laxatives, and
fuch things as purify the blood, and promote the perlpiration. A nd, after the in­
flammation has been checked by opening medicines, the decoCtion o f woods and
bitter herbs may be drunk, as recommended for this difeafe in the Herbal.
O f t h e I N F L A M M A T I O N of t h e B R A I N .
T H E fymptoms which ufually precede a true inflammation o f the brain, are pain
o f the head, rednefs o f the eyes, a violent flu lhin gof the face, diftyrbed fleep, or a'total
i want
want o f it, great drinefs o f the skin, coftivenefs, a retention o f urine, a fmall drop­
ping o f blood from the nofe, finging o f the ears, and extreme fenfibility o f the nerv­
ous fyftem. W hen the brain itfelf is inflamed, the pulfe is always foft and lo w ;
bur, when the inflammation only affects the integuments o f the brain, vi2. the dura
and pia mater, it is hard.
C U R E .— A s this difeafe often proves fatal in a few days, 'it requires the m oft
fpeedy applications. W hen it is prolonged, or improperly treated, it fometimes ends
in madnefs, or a kind o f flupidity which continues fo r life. T w o things are chiefly
to be attended to, in the cure, v iz. tq leflen the quantity o f blood in the brain, and
to retard the circulation towards the head. N othing more certainly relieves the pa­
tient than a free difcharge o f blood from the nofe. W hen this comes o f its ow n
accord, it is by no means to be (topped, but rather promoted, by applying cloths dip­
ped in warm water to the part. W hen bleeding at the nofe does not happen fponta-
neoufly, it may be provoked by putting a draw , or any other (harp body, u p
the noftril. Bleeding in the temporal arteries greatly relieves the h ead : but, as
this operation cannot always be performed, we w ould recommend in its dead bleed­
ing in the ju gu lar veins. W hen the patient’s pulfe and fpirits are fo low , that he
cannot bear bleeding with the lancet, leeches may be applied to the temples. T h efe
not only d ra w o ff the blood more gradually, but, by being applied nearer to the part
affedted, generally give more immediate relief. I f the inflammation o f the brain be
occafioned by the doppage o f evacuations either natural or artificial, as the menfes,
iflues, fetons, or fuch lik e , all means m ud be ufed to redore them as foon as poflible,
or to fubftitute others in their dead. T h e patient’s body m ud be kept open b y
dim ulating clyders or fm art p u rges; and fmall quantities o f nitre ought frequently
to be m ixed with his drink. T w o or three drachm s, or more, if the cafe be dan­
gerous, may be ufed in the fpace o f twenty-four hours. I f the difeafe proves obfti-
nate, and does not yield to the medicines, it w ill be neceffary to apply a bliflering-
plader to the whole head.
O f t h e I N F L A M M A T I O N of t h e E Y E S .
T H I S diforder is attended with acute pain, hear, rednefs, and fwelling.— T h e
patient is not able to bear the light, and fometimes he feels a pricking pain, as if
his eyes were pierced w ith a thorn. T h e pulfe is generally quick and hard, with
fomc degree o f fever. W hen the difeafe is violent, the neighbouring parts fw ell,
and there is a throbbing or pulfation in the temporal arteries, & c . A flight inflam­
mation o f the eyes, efpecially from an external caufe, is eafily cured ; but, when the
difeafe is violent, and continues long, it often leaves fpecks upon the eyes, or dim -
nefs o f fight, and fometimes total biiodnefs.

C U R E — T h e patient m ull abftain from every thing o f a heating nature. H is
food fhould confift chiefly o f mild vegetables, weak broths, and gruels. H is drink
may be barley-water, balm -tea, common whey, and fuch like. Bleeding, in a violent
inflammation o f the eyes, is always neceflary. T h is fhould be performed as near
the part affected as poffible. A n adult may lofe ten or twelves ounces o f blood from
the ju gu lar vein, and the operation may be repeated according to the urgency o f
the fymptoms. I f it fhould not be convenient to bleed in the neck, the fame quan­
tity may be let from the arm , or any other part o f the body. Leeches are often
applied to the temples, or under the eyes, with good effe<5t. T h e wounds muft be
fuffered to bleed for fome hours, and, if the bleeding flop foon, it may be promoted
by the application o f cloths dipt in warm water. In obftinate cafes, it will be ne­
ceflary to repeat this operation feveral times. O pening and diluting medicines are
by no means to be negle&ed ; but, if the inflammation does not yield to thefe evacu­
ations, bliflers muft be applied to the temples, behind the ears, or upon the neck,
and kept open for fome tim e. I have feldom known thefe, if long enough kept
open, fail to remove the m oft obftinate inflammation o f the eyes; but, for this pur-
pofe, it is often neceflary to continue the difeharge for feveral weeks. T h o le who
are liable to frequent returns o f this difeafe, ought conftantly to have an iflue in one
or both arms, or a feton cue betwixt the fhoulders. Bleeding or purging in the
fpring and autumn will be very beneficial to fuch perfons.
O f t h e Q U IN S E Y , o r I N F L A M M A T O R Y S O R E T H R O A T .
T H I S difeafe is frequently attended with great danger. W hen the inflammation
comes on, the parts appear red and fw elled; the patient complains o f pain in
{wallowing ; his pulfe is qu ick and hard, with other fymptoms o f a fever. I f blood
be let, it is generally covered with a tough coat o f a whitifh colour, and the patient
fpits a tough phlegm. A s the fwelling and inflammation encreafe, the breathing
and {wallowing become more difficult; the pain affefts the ears; the eyes generally
appear red; and the face fwells. W hen the breathing is laborious, with ftraight-
nefs o f the bread, and anxiety, the danger is great. T h o u gh the pain in fwallowing
be very great, yet, while the patient breathes eafy, there is not fo much danger;
A n external fwelling is no unfavourable fym ptom ; but, if it fuddenly falls, and the
difeafe affefts the bread, the danger is very great. W hen a quinfey is the confe-
quence o f fome other difeafe, which has already weakened the patient, his fituation
is dangerous. A frothing at the mouth, and a fwelled tongue, a pale ghaftiy coun­
tenance, and coldnefs o f the extremities, are fatal fymptoms.
C U R E — It is peculiarly neceflary that the neck be kept w arm ; for which pur-
pofe feveral folds of foft flannel may be wrapt round it. T h e jelly o f black cur­
rants is a medicine very m uch in efteem for complaints o f the throat $and indeed it
35* Oo is
14*
is o f fom eufe. It fhould be almoft conftantlykept in them outh, andfwallowed d ow n
lcifurely. It may likew ife be mixed in the patient's drink, or taken any other w ay.
W hen it cannot be obtained, the je lly o f red currants, or o f m ulberries, m a y b e
ufed in its (lead. G argles are alfo very beneficial; they may be made o f fage-tea,
w ith a little vinegar and hon ey; and may be uled three or four times a-d ay; and,
i f the patient be troubled with tough vilcid phlegm , the gargle may be rendered
more fharp and cleanfing by adding to it a teafpoon*full o f fpirit o f fal ammoniac. 1
T h ere is no difeafe wherein the benefit o f bathing the feet and legs in lukewarm
water is more apparent: that practice ought therefore never to be negledted. I f
the inflammation be violent, it will be proper, as foon as the fymptoms appear, to
bleed in the arm , or rather in the ju gu lar vein, and to repeat the operation i f cir-
cumftances require. T h e body fhould likewife be kept gently open. T h is may
bedone by givin g thepatientfor hisordinary drink a decottionof figs and tamarinds,

fal prune), or purified nitre, held in the m outh, and fwallowed down as it melts.
T h is promotes the difeharge o f faliva, by which means it anfwers the end o f a gar­
gle, while at the fame tim e it abates the fever, by prom oting the difeharge o f urine,
& c . Bliftering upon the neck or behind the ears, in violent inflammations o f the
throat, is very beneficial; and in bad cafes it will be neceflary to lay a bliftering-
plafter quite acrofs the throat, fo as to reach from ear to ear. A fter the plaflers
are taken off, the parts ought to be kept running b y the application o f iffue oint­
m ent, till the inflammation is g o n e ; otherwife, upon their drying up, the patient
w ill be in danger o f a relapfe. W hen a difficulty o f fwallowing is not attended
w ith an acute pain o r inflammation, it only requires that the part be kept warm ,
and the throat frequently gargled with fom ething that may gently ftim ulate the
glands, as a decoition o f figs with vinegar and honey, to which may be added a
little muftard, or a fm all o.uantity o f fpirits. Buc this gargle is never to be ufed
where there are figns o f an inflammation. T hofe w ho are fubjeit to inflammations
o f the throat, in orderto avoid that difeafe, ought to live temperate. Such as do
r.ot chufe to obferve this rule m uft have frequent recourfe to purging and other
evacuations, to difeharge the fuperftuous hum ours. T h ey ought likew ife to be­
ware o f catching cold , and fhould abftain from aliment and medicines o f an aftrin-
gent onftim ulating nature.

T H I S is evidently a contagious diftemper, and is generally communicated b y in­
fection. W h o le fam ilies, and even entire villages, often receive the infection from
one perfon. W hatever tends to produce putrid or malignant fevers may likewife

occafion the putrid ulcerous fo:c throat, as unwholtrfome air, damaged provifions,
negleft ofcleanlinefs, & c. It begins with alternate fits o f fliivering and heat. T h e
pulfe is quick, but low and unequal, and generally continues fo through the whole
courfe o f the difeafe. T h e tongue is white, and generally m oift, which diftinguifhes
this from an inflammatory difeafe. U pon looking into the throat, it appears fwelled,
and o f a florid red colour. Pale or afh coloured fpots, however, are here and there
interfperfed, and fometimes one broad patch or fpot, o f an irregular figure, and
pale white colour, furrounded with florid red, only appears. Tliefe whitifh fpots
or floughs cover fo many ulcers. T h e putrid ulcerous fore throat may be diftin-
guifted from the inflammatory by the vom iting and loofenefs with which it is gene­
rally ulhered in *
, the foul ulcers in the throat covered with a white or livid coat
and by the exceffivc weaknefs o f the patient j with other fymptoms o f a putrid fever.
C U R E .— T h e treatment in this kind o f fore throat is entirely different from that
which is proper in the inflammatory. A ll evacuations, as bleeding, purging, & c.
which weaken the patient, muft be avoided. C ooling medicines, as nitre and
cream o f tartar, are likewife hurtful. Strengthening cordials alone can be ufed
with fafecy j and thefe ought never to be negle<5ted. If, at the beginning, there is
a great naufea, or inclination to vomir, the patient muft drink an infufion o f green
tea, camomile flowers, or carduus benediBus, in order to cleanfe the (lomach. I f
thefe are not fuflicient, he may take a few grains o f the powder o f ipecacuanha, or
any other gentle vom it. I f the difeafe is m ild, the throat may be gargled with an
infufion o f fage and rofe leaves, to a gill o f which may be added a fpoonful or two
o f honey, and as much vinegar as will make it agreeably acid j but, when the fymp­
toms arc urgent, it will be o f a great benefit if the patient frequently receives into his
mouth, through an inverted funnel, the ftreams o f warm vinegar, myrrh, and honey.
B ut, when the putrid f>mptoms run high, and the difeafe is attended with danger,
the only medicine that can be depended upon is the Peruvian bark. It may be
taken in fubftance, if the patient’s ftomach will bear it. I f not, an ounce o f bark
grofsly powdered, with two drachms o f Virginian fnake-rooc, may be boiled in a
pint and a half o f water to h a lf a pint j to which a tea-fpoonful o f the elixir o f vi­
triol may be added, and an ordinary tea-cupful o f it taken every three or four
hours. Blifters are very beneficial in this difeafe, efpecially when the patient’s pulfe
and fpirits are low. T h ey m ay be applied to the throat, behind the ears, or upon,
the back part o f the neck. I f a difeharge o f blood from the nofe happens, the
fteams o f warm vinegar may be received up the noftrils frequently; and the drink
muft be fharpened with fpirits o f vitriol, or tinfture o f rofcs. In cafe o f a ftrangu-
ary, the belly muft be fomented with warm water, and emollient clyfters given
three or four times a-day. A fter the violence o f the difeafeis over, the body fhould
ftill be kept open with mild purgatives; as manna, fenna, rhubarb, or the like.

C O L D S are the effect o f an obftru&ed perfpiration*
, and almoft every cold is a
kind o f fever, which only differs in degree from fome o f thofe that have already
been treated of. N o age, fex, or conftitution, is exem pted from this difeafe; nei­
ther is it in the power o f any medicine or regimen to prevent it. T h e inhabitants
o f every clim ate are liable to catch cold, nor can even the greateft circum fpe&ion
defend them at all tim es from its attacks. Indeed, if the human body could be
k ep t conflancly in an uniform degree o f warm th, fuch a thing as catching cold
w ould be im poffible: b u t, as that cannot beeffedted by any means, the perfpiration
m ult be liable to many changes. W hen oppreflion o f the breaft, a fluffing o f the
nofe, unufual wearinefs, pain o f the head, & c . give ground to believe that the per­
fpiration is obftrudted, or, in other words, that the perfon has caught cold, he
ought immediately to lellen his diet, at lead the ufual quantity o f his folid food,
and to abftain from all drong liquors. W ou ld people facrifice a little time to cafe
and warmth, and pradlife a moderate degree o f abdinence when the fird fymptoms
o f a cold appear, we have reafon to believe, that m od o f the bad effcdts which flow
from an obdrudted perfpiration m ight be prevented. B u t, after the difeafe has
gathered ftrength by delay, all attempts to remove it often prove vain. A pleurify,
a peripneumony, o ra fatal confumption o f the lungs, are ofcen the effedts o f com ­
m on cold s; notwithdanding people affedt to treat them with fo m uch indifference
and negledt, merely becaufe they are only colds. H ence it is, that colds deftroy
fuch numbers o f m ankind. L ik e an enemy defpifed, they gather drength from
delay, till, at length, they become invincible. It is certain, however, that colds m ay
be too much indulged. W hen a perfon, for every flight cold, fhuts him felf u p in
a warm room, fwallows medicine, and drinks great quantities o f warm liquor, it
may occafion fuch a general relaxation o f the folids as w ill not be eafily rem oved.
Bathing the feet in warm water, lying in bed, and drinking warm water-gruel, or
other weak liquors, w ill fooner take o ff a fpafm, and reflore the perfpiration, than
all the hot fudorific medicines in the world. T h is is all that is neceffary for rem ov­
ing a common c o ld ; and, if this courfe be taken at the beginning, it w ill feldom
fail. W hen the fymptoms do not yield to abdinence, warm th, and diluting liquors,
there is reafon to fear the approach o f fome other difeafe, as an inflammation o f the
bread, an ardent fever, or the like, and the patient fhould then be treated accord­
ingly. T h e ch ief fecret o f preventing colds lies in avoiding as far as poffible, all
extremes either o f heat or cold, and in taking care, when the body is heated, to
letitcoc'. gradually.

A C O U G H is generally the effect o f a cold, which has either been improperly-
treated, or entirely neglefted. W hen it proves obftinate, there is always reafon to
fear the confequences, as thisfliew sa weak ftatc o f the lungs, and is often the
forerunnner o f a confumption. I f the cough be violent, and the patient young and
ftrong, with a hard quick pulfe, bleeding will be proper •, but, in weak and relaxed
habits, bleeding rather prolongs the difeafe. W hen the patient fpits freely, bleed­
ing is unneceflary, and fometimes hurtful, as it tends to leflen that difcharge.
W h en a co u gh is occafioned by acrid humours tickling the throat and fauces, the
patient Ihould keep fome fofc pejo r a l lozenges almoft conftantly in his m outh; as
the P o n tefraj liquorice cakes, barley-fugar, the common balfamic lozenges, Spa.
nifh juice, & c . Thefe blunt the acrimony o f the hum ours, and, by taking o ff
their ftim ulatingquality, help to appeafe the cough. In obftinate coughs, proceed­
ing from a flux o f humours upon the lungs, it will often be neceflary, befides ex-
p ejoratin g medicines, to have recourfe to iflues, fetons, o r fome other drain. In
this cafe I have often obferved the moft happy effej s from a Burgundy-pitch
plafter applied between the fhoulders. A bou t the bulk o f a nutmeg o f Burgundy-
pitch may be fpread thin upon a piece o f fofc leather, about the fize o f the hand,
and laid between the fhoulder-blades. It may be taken o ff and wiped every three
or four days, and ought to be renewed once a fortnight or three weeks. T h is is,
indeed, a cheap and Ample medicine, and confequently apt to be defpifed; but we
•will venture to affirm, that the whole materia medtca does not afford an application
more efficacious in almoft every kind o f cough. It has not, indeed, always an im­
mediate effej ; but, if kept on for fome time, it w ill fucceed where moft other
medicines fail. But coughs proceed from many other caufes befides defluxions
upon the lungs. In thefe cafes the cure is not to be attempted by pejo r a l medi­
cines. T hu s, in a cough proceeding from a foulnefs and debility o f the ftomach*
fyrups, oils, mucilages, and all kinds o f balfamic medicines, do hurt. T h e ftomach
cough may be known from one that is owing to a fault in the lungs by this, that
in the latter the patient coughs whenever he infpires, or draws in his breath fu lly;
but in the former that does not happen.
C U R E .-—T h e cure o f this cough depends chiefly upon cleanfing and le n g t h ­
ening the ftomach j for which purpofe gentle vomits and bitter purgatives are moft
proper. T hu s, after a vom it or tw o, the facred tinju r e , as it is called, may be
taken for a conflderable time in the dofe o f one or two table-fpoonfuls twice a-day,
or as often as it is found neceflary, to keep the body gently open. People may
m ake this tinju r e themfelves, by infufing an ounce o f hiera picra in an E ng-
lilh pint o f white-wine, letting it ftand a few days, and then ftraining it. In
35* P p coughs
coughs which proceed from a debility o f the ftomach, the Peruvian bark is like-
w ifeofconfiderablefervice. It may either be chewed,, taken in powder, or made
intoa tindurc along with other ftomachic bitters. A nervous cough can only be re­
moved by change o f air and proper exercife. Im merfing the feet and hands in
warm water will often appealethe violence o f a nervous cough. W hen a cough
is only the fymptoin o f fome other malady, it is in vain to attempt to rem ove it
without firft curing thedifeafe from which it proceeds. T h u s, when a cough is
occafioned by teething, keeping the body open, fcarifying the gum s, or whatever
facilitates the cutting o f the teeth, likewife appeafes the cough. In like manner,
when worms occafion a cough, fuch medicines as remove thefe vermin will generally
cure the cough ; as bitter purgatives, oily clyfters, and fuch like. W om en, dur­
ing the laft months o f pregnancy, are often greatly afilidled with a cough, which is
generally relieved by bleeding and keeping the body open. T h ey ought to avoid
all flatulent food, and to wear a Joofe eafy drefs.
O f t h e W H O O P I N G o r C H I N C O U G H .
T H I S cough feldom affects adults, but proves often fatal to children. W h a t­
ever hurts the digeftion, obftrufts the perfpiration, or relaxes the folids, difpofes to
thisdifeafe: confequently its cure muft depend upon cleanfing and {lengthening
the ftomach, bracing the folids, and, at the fame tim e, promoting perfpiration and
the different fecretions.
C U R E .— O ne o f the moft effc&ual remedies in the chin-cough is change o f air.
T h is often removes the m alady, even when the change feems to be from a purer
to a lefs wholefome air. T h is may in fomc meafure depend on the patient’s being
removed from the place where the infection prevails. M oft o f the difeafes o f chil­
dren are infettious > nor is it at all uncommon to find the chin-cough prevailing
in one town or village, when another, a ta very fmall diftance, is quite free from
it. Bur, whatever be the caufe, we are fure o f the fadl. N o tim e ought therefore
to be loft in rem oving the patient at fome diftance from the place where he caught
thedifeafe, and, if polfible, into a more pure and warm air. W hen the difeafe
proves violent, and the patient is in danger o f being fuffocated by the cough, he
ought to be bled, efpecially if there be a fever with a hard full pulfe. B ut, as the
chief intention o f bleeding is to prevent an inflammation o f the lungs, and to ren­
der it more fate to give vom its, it will feldom be neceffary to repeat the operation;
yet, if there be fymptoms o f an inflammation o f the lungs, a fecond, or even a third,
bleeding m a y r e q u i f i t e . Vom its not only cleanfe the ftomach, which in this
difeafe is generally loaded wirh vifeid phlegm, but they likewife promote the per-
Ipiration and other fecretions; and ought therefore to be repeated according to
the
146 C U L P E P E R ' S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 147
the obftinacy o f the difeafe. T hey fliould not be ftrongj gentle vomits frequently
repeated are lefs dangerous, and more beneficial, than ftrong ones. M any people
believe chat oily, pedtoral, and balfamic, medicines poflcfs wonderful virtues for
the cure o f thechin-cough, and accordingly exhibit them plentifully to patients
o f every age and conftitution, without confidering that every thing o f this nature
muft load the ftomach, hurt the digeftion, and o f courfe aggravate the diforder.
T h e millepedes, or woodlice, are greatly recommended for the cure o f a chin-cough.
Thofe, whochufe to make ufe ofthefe infects, may infufe two ounces of them
bruiled in an Englifli pint o f fmall white-wine for one night. Afterwards the
liquor may be (trained through a cloth, and a table fpoonful o f it given to the
patient three or four times a-day. Opiates are fometimes neceflary to allay the vio­
lence o f the cough. For this purpofe a little o f the fyrup o f poppies, or five,
fix, or feven, drops of laudanum, according to the age o f the patient, may be
taken in a c u p o f hyfiop or penny-royal-tea, and repeated occafionally. T h e gar­
lic ointment is a well known remedy in North-Britain for the chin-cough, it is
made by beating in a mortar garlic with an equal quantity o f hogs lard. W ith this
the foies o f the feet may be rubbed twice or thrice a-day ; but the beft method is
to fpread it upon a rag, and apply it in the form o f a plaftcr. It fliould be renew­
ed every night and morning at leaft, as the garlic foon lofes its virtue. T h is is
an exceeding good medicine both in the chin-cough and in m od other coughs o f
an obftinate nature. It ought not, however, to be ufed when the patient is very hot
or feverilh, left it fliould increafe thefe fymptoms.
I N F L A M M A T I O N o f t h e S T O M A C H .
A N inflammation o f the ftomach may proceed from any o f the caufes which pro­
duce an inflammatory fever; as cold liquor drunk while the body is warm ,obftruc-
ted perlpiration, or the fuddenftriking in o f any eruption. It is attended with a fixed
pain and burning heat in the ftom ach; great reftleflhefsand anxiety; a fmall, quick,
and hard, pulfe; vom iting, or, at leaft, a naufea and ficknefs; exedfive th ird ; cold-
nefs o f the extrem ities; difficulty o f breathing; cold clam my fw eats; and fometimes
convulfions and fainting fits. T h e ftomach is fwellcd,and often feels hard to the
touch. One o f the m od certain figns o f this difeafe is the fenfe o f pain, which the
patient feels upon taking any kind o f food or drink, efpccially if it be either too hot
or too cold.
C U R E .— AH acrimonious, heating, and irritating, food and drink are carefully
to be avoided. T h e weaknefs o f the patient may deceive the by-ftanders, and in­
duce them to give him wines, fpirits, or other cordials j but thefe never fail to
increafe the difeafe, and often occafion Hidden death. T h e inclination to vom it
may
2
i4S C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
m ay likew ife impofe on the attendants, and m ake them think a vom it neceflary;
but that too is alm oft certain death. Bleeding is abfolutely neceflary, and is alm oft
theonly thing that can be depended on. W hen the difeafe proves obftinate, it will
often be proper to repeat this operation feveral tim es, nor m ud the low ftate o f the
pulfe deter us from doing fo. T h e pulle indeed generally rifes upon bleeding, and,
as long as chat is the cafe, the operation is fafe. Frequent fomentations with
lukewarm water, or a decottion of emollient vegetables, as recommended in the
H erbal, are likewife beneficial. Flannel cloths dipped in thefe m ull be applied
to the region o f the ftom ach, and removed as they grow cool. In this, and all other
inflammations o f the bowels, an epifpaftic, or bliftering-plaifter, applied over the
part aflfe&ed, is one o f the bell remedies known. T h e only internal medicines
which can with fafety be recommended are mild clyfters. Thefe may be made o f
warm water, or thin w ater-gruel; and, if the patient is coftive, a little fweet oil,
honey, or manna, may be added. Clyfters anfwer the purpofe o f an internal fo­
mentation, while they keep the body open, and at the fame ti me nourifh the patienr,
who is often, in this difeafe, unable to retain any food upon his ftomach. For thefe
reafons they muft not be neglected, as the patient’s life may depend on them.
I N F L A M M A T I O N o f t h e I N T E S T I N E S .
T H I S is one o f the moft painful and dangerous difeafes that mankind is lia­
ble to. It generally proceeds from the fame caufes as the inflammation o f the
ftom ach; to which m ay be added coftivenefs, worm s, eating unripe fruits, or great
quantities o f nuts, drinking hard windy malt liquors, as ftale bottled beer or ale,
four wine, cyder, & c . T h e inflammation o f the inteftines is denominated iliac
paflion, enteritis, & c . according to the name o f the parts affefled. T h e treatment
however is nearly the fame, whatever part o f the inteftinal canal be the feat o f the
difeafe. T h e fym ptom s are nearly the fame as in the foregoing difeafe j only the
pain, if pofiible, is more acute, and is fuuated lower. T h e vom iting is likewife
more violent, and fometimes even the excrements, together with the clyfters and
fuppolitories, are difeharged by the mouth. W h ile the pain Ihifts, and the vom it­
ing only returns at certain intervals, and while the clyfters pafs downwards, there
is ground to hope; b u t, when the clyfters and faeces are vom ited, and the patient is
exceeding weak, with a low fluttering pulfe, a pale countenance, and a difagreeable
or {linking breath, there is great reafon to fear that the confequences w ill prove fa­
tal. Clam m y fweats, black foetid ftools, with a fm all intermitting pulfe, and a
total ceflation o f pain, are figns o f a mortification already begun,and o f approaching
death.
C U R E .— Bleeding, in this as well as in the inflammation o f the ftom ach, is o f
thegreateft importance. It fhould be performed as foon as the fymptoms appear,
and
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . *49
and muft be repeated according to the ftrength o f the patient and the violence o f
the difeafe. A blifter is likewife to be applied immediately over the part where the
m oft violent pain is. T his not only relieves the pain o f the bowels, but even
clyfters and purgative medicines, which before had no cffelt, will operate when the
blifter begins to rife. T h e patient’s feet and legs fhould frequently be bathed in
warm water, and cloths dipped in it applied to his belly. Bladders filled with
warm warermay likewife be applied to the region o f the navel, and warm bricks, or
bottles filled with warm water, to the foies o f the feet. I f the difeafe does not
yield to clyfters and fomentations, recourfe muft be had to pretty ftrong purgatives j
but, as thefe, by irritating the bowels, often increafe their contrattion, and by that
means fruftraee their own intention, it will be neceflary to join them with opiates,
which, by allaying the pain, and relaxing the fpafmodic contractions o f the guts,
greatly affift the operation o f purgatives in this cafe. W h at anfwers the purpofe of
opening the body very well, is a folution o f the bitter purging fairs. T w o ounces
o f thefe may be diflfolved in an Englifh pint o f warm water, or thin gruel, anda
tea-cupful o f it taken every half-hour till it operates. A t the fame time fifteen,
twenty, or twenty-five, drops o f laudanum may be given in a glafs o f ixpper-mint
or fimple cinnamon-water, to appeafe the irritation, and prevent the vom iting, & c.
B ut it often happens that no liquid whatever will ftay on the ftomach. In this
cafe, the patient muft take purging pills. I have generally found the follow­
in g anfwer very w e ll: T a k e jalap in powder, and vitriolatcd tartar, o f each
half a drachm ; opium one grain ; Caftiie foap as much as will make the mafs fit
for pills. Thefe muft be taken at one dofe* and, if they do not operate in a few
hours, the dofe may be repeated. It a ftool cannot be procured by any o f the
above means, it will be necelTary to immerfe the patient in warm water up to the
breaft. T his often fucceeds when other means have been tried in vain. T h e pa­
tient muft continue in the water as long as he caneafiiy bear it without fainting; and,
if one immerfion has not thedefired effect, it may be repeated as foon as the pa­
tient’s ftrength and fpirits are recruited. It is more fafe for him to go frequently
into the bath than to continue too long at a time i and it is often neceflary to repeat
it feveral times before it has the defired effett. In defperate cafes it is common to
give quickfilver. This may be given to the quantity o f feveral ounces, or even a
pound, but Ihould not exceed that. W hen there is reafon to fufpeCl a mortification
o f the guts, this medicine ought not to be tried. In that cafe it cannot cure the pa­
tient, and will only haften his death. But, when the obftrultion is occafioned by
any caufe that can be removed by force, quickfilver is noc only a proper medicine,
but the beft that can be adminiftered, as it is the fitteft body we know for making
its way through the inteftinal canal,
3^. O f -
O f t h e C H O L I C .
T H E cholic has a great refemblance to the tw o preceding difeafes, both in its
fymptoms and method o f cure. It is generally attended with coftivenefs and acute
pain o f the bowels *
, and requires diluting diet, evacuations, fomentations, & c.
Cholics are varioufly denominated, according to their caufes, as the flatulent, the
bilious, the hyfteric, the nervous, & c.
C U R E .— W hen the difeafeproceeds from windy liquor, green fruit, four herbs,
or the like, the beft medicine on the firft appearance o f the fymptoms is a d ra m o f
brandy, gin, or any good fpirits. T h e patient fhould likewife fit with his feet upon
a warm hearth-ftone, or apply warm bricks to th em ; and warm cloths may beap-
plied to the ftomach and bowels. T h is is the only cholic wherein ardent fpirits,
fpiceries, or any thing o f a hot nature, may be ventured upon. N or indeed are
they to be ufed here unlefs at the very beginning, before any fymptoms o f inflam*
mation appear. T h e bilious cholic is attended w ith very acute pains about the re*
gion o f the navel, T h e patient complains o f great third, and is generally coftive.*
H e vomits a hot, bitter, yellow-coloured, bile, which, being difcharged, feems to
afford fome relief, but is qu ickly followed by the fame violent pain as before. A s
the diftemper advances, the propenficy to vom it fometimes increafes fo as to become
almoft continual, and the proper motion o f the inteftines is fo far perverted, that
there are all the fymptoms o f an impending iliac paffion. I f the patient be young
and ftrong, and the pulfe full and frequent, it will be proper to bleed, after which
clyfters may be adminiftered. Clear whey or gruel, fharpened with the ju ice o f
lemon, or cream o f tartar, muft be drunk freely : it will be neceffary likewife to
foment the belly with cloths dipped in warm w ater; and, if this fhould not fucceed,
the patient muft be immerfed up to the bread in warm water. In the bilious cholic,
the vom iting is often very difficult toreftrain. W hen this happens, the patient
may drink a decottiqn o f toafted bread, or an infufion o f garden-mint in boiling
water. Such as are liable to frequent returns o f the bilious cholic fhould ufe flefh
fparingly, and live chiefly upon a light vegetable diet. T h ey fhould likewife take
frequently a dofe o f cream o f tartar with tamarinds, or any other cool acid purge.
T h e hyileric cholic bears a great refemblance to the bilious. It is attended with
acute pains about the region o f the ftomach, vom iting, & c. But what the patient
vom its in this cafe is commonly o f a greenifh colour. There is a great finking o f
the fpirits, with dejeftion o f mind and difficulty o f breathing, which are the cha-
ra&eriftic fymptoms o f this diforder. Sometimes it is accompanied with the jaun*
d ice; but this generally goes o ff o f its own accord in a few days. In this cholic
all evacuations, as bleedin g, purging, vom iting, & c . do hurt. E very thing that
i weakens
150 C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
weakens the patient, or finks the fpirits, is to be avoided. I f however the vom iting
fhould prove violent, lukewarm water, or fmall poflet, may be drunk, to cleanfe the
ftomach. Afterwards the patient may take fifteen, twenty, or twenty* five, drops o f
liquid laudanum in a glafs of cinnamon-water. T h is may be repeated every ten or
twelve hours till the fymptoms abate. T h e nervous cholic prevails among miners,

den veflels ufed in preparing that liquor. N o difeafe o f the bowels is attended with
more excruciating pain than this. N or is it foon at an end. I have known it con­
tinue eight or ten days with very little intermiflion, the body all the while continuing

however leaves the patient weak, and often ends in a palfy. T h e general treat­
ment o f this difeafe is the fame with that o f the iliac pallion, or inflammation o f the
bowels.

T H IS difeafe may proceed from any o f thofe caufes which produce an inflamma­
tory fever. It may likewife be occafioned by wounds or bruifes o f the kidnies ; fmall
Rones or gravel lodging within them*, by hard riding or w alking, efpecially in hot
weather; or whatever drives the blood too forcibly into the kidnies may occafion
this malady.
C U R E .* -E v e ry thing o f a heating or ftimulating nature is to be avoided. E m ol­
lient and thin liquors muft be plentifully drunk; as clear whey, or baum-tca fweet-
ened with honey, decoctions o f marfh-mallow roots, with barley and liquorice, & c .
Bleeding is generally neceflary, efpecially at the beginning. T en or twelve ounces
may be let from the arm or foot; and, if the pain and inflammation continue, the
operation may be repeated in twenty-four hours, efpecially if the patient be o f a
full habit. Leeches may likewife be applied to the hmmorrhoidal veins, as a dif-
charge from thefe will greatly relieve the patient. Cloths dipped in warm water,
or bladders filled with it, m uft be applied as near as poflible to the part affeCted, and
renewed as they grow cool. I f the bladders be filled with a decoition o f mallows
and camomile flowers, to which a little faffron is added, and mixed with about a
third part o f new m ilk, it w ill be (till more beneficial. Em ollient clyfters ought
frequently to be adminiftered; and, if thefe do not open the body, a little fait and
honey or manna may be added to them. T h e fame courfe is to be followed where
gravel or a ftone is lodged in the kidney; but, when the gravel or (tone is feparated
from the kidney, and lodges in the ureter, it will be proper, befides the fomenta­
tions, to rub the fmall o f the back with fweetoil, and to give gentle diuretics: asjit.

T H E inflammation o f the bladder proceeds, in a great mcafure, from the fame
caufes as that o f the kidoies. It is known by an acute pain towards the bottom o f
the belly, and difficulty o f paffing urine, with fome degree o f fever, a conftane in­
clination to g o to ftoo), and a perpetual defire to m ake water. T h is difeafe m uft be
treated on the fame principles as the one immediately preceding. T h e patient fhould
abftain from every thing that is o f a hot, acrid, and {Simulating, quality, and fhould
live entirely upon fmall broths, gruels, or m ild vegetables. B ut a ftoppage o f urine
may proceed from ocher caufes befides an inflammation o f the bladder*, as a fwelling
o f the hsemorrhoidal veins, hard fasces in the retu rn *
, a ftone in the bladder*, excre-
fcences in the urinary pafTages, a palfy o f the bladder, hyfteric affections, & c . In
all which cafes, mild and gentle applications are thefafeft; ftrong diuretic medicines,
or things o f an irritating nature, generally increafe the danger. 1 have known fome
ptrfons kill themfelves by introducing probes into the urinary paflages, to remove,
as they thought, fomewhat that obftru&ed the difeharge o f urine; and others bring
on a violent inflammation o f the bladder, by ufing ftrOng diuretics, as oil o f turpen­
tine, & c. for that purpofe.
I N F L A M M A T I O N o f t h e L I V E R .
T H I S difeafe is know n by a painful tenfion o f the right fide under the falfe ribs,
attended with fome degree o f fever, a fenfe o f weight, or fulnefs o f the part, difficul­
ty o f breathing, loathing o f food, great thirft, with a pale or yellowiffi colour o f the
Ikin and eyes. T h is difeafe, if properly treated, is feldom mortal. I f it ends in a
iuppuration, and the matter cannot be difeharged outwardly, the danger is then
great. W hen the feirrhus o f the liver enfues, the patient, if he obferves a proper re­
gimen, may neverthelefs live a number o f years; but, if he indulge in animal food
and ftrong liquors, or take medicines o f an acrid or irritating nature, the feirrhus
w ill be convered into a cancer, which m uft infallibly prove fatal.
C U R E .— T h e lam e regimen is to be obferved in this as in other inflammatory
diforders. A ll hot things are to be carefully avoided, and cool diluting liquors, as
whey, barley-water, & c . drunk freely. T h e food muft be light and thin, and the
body, as well as the mind, kept eafy and quiet. Bleeding is proper at the beginning;
and it will often be neceffary, even though the pulfe fhould not feel hard, to repeat
it.

it. AH violent purgatives are to be avoided ; the body however muft be kept gent­
ly open. A decoftion o f tamarinds, with a little honey or manna, will anfwer this
purpofe very well. T h e fide affe&ed muft be fomented in the manner directed in
the foregoing difeafes. M ild laxative clyfters fhould be frequently adminiftered ;
and, if the pain fhould notwithftanding continue violent, a bliftcring-plafter may
be applied over the part affetted. Medicines which promote the fecretion o f urine
have a very good effedl here. For this purpofe, half a drachm o f purified nitre, or
a tea-fpoonful o f the fweet fpirits o f nitre, may be taken in. a cup o f the patient’s
drink three or four times a-day. A ll inflammations o f the vilcera muft in general
be treated upon the fame principles as thofe already mentioned. T h e chief rule,
with refpett to all o f them, is to let blood, to avoid every thing that is ftrong, or o f
a heating nature, to apply warm fomentations to the part affected, and to caufe the
patient to drink a fufficient quantity o f warm diluting liquors.
O f t h e C H O L E R A M O R B U S .
T H E cholera morbus is a violent purging and vom iting, attended with gripes,
ficknefs, and a conftant defire to go to ftool. It comes on fuddenly, and is m od
common in autumn. There is hardly any difeafe that kills more quickly than this,
when proper means are not ufed in due time for removing it. It is generally pre­
ceded by the heart-burn, four belchings, and flatulences, with pain o f the ftomach
and inteftines, Tothefe fucceed exceflive vom iting, and purging o f green, yellow,
or blackifh, coloured bile, w ith a diftention o f the ftom ach, and violent griping
pains. There is likewife a great third, with a very quick unequal pulfe, and often
a fixed acute pain about the region o f the navel. A s the difeafe advances, the pulfe
often finks fo low as to become quite imperceptible, the extremities grow cold, or
cramped, and are often covered with a clammy fweat *
, the urine is obftru&cd, and
there is a palpitation o f the heart. Violent hiccup, fainting, and convulfions, are
the figns o f approaching death.
C U R E .— A t the beginning o f this difeafe, the efforts o f nature to expel the of­
fending caufe fhould be affifted, by promoting the purging and vom iting. For
this purpofe the patient m uft drink freely o f diluting liquors; as whey, butter­
m ilk, warm water, thin water-gruel, fmall poffet, or, what is perhaps preferable to
any o f them, very weak chicken broth. T h is fhould not only be drunk plentifully
to promote the vom iting, b u ta c ly fte ro f it given every hour in order to promote
the purging. W arm negus, or ftrong wine whey, will likewife be neceffary to
fupport the patient’s fpirits, and promote perfpiration. H is legs fhould be bathed
in warm water, and afterwards rubbed with flannel cloths, or wrapped in. warm
blankets, and warm bricks applied to the foies o f his feet. Flannels wrung out o f
36. R r warm
*54
warm fpirituous fomentations fhould likewife be applied to the region o f the fto­
mach. W hen the violence o f the difeafe is over, to prevent a relapfe, it w ill be
neceffary, for fome tim e, to continue the ufe o f fmall dofes o f laudanum. T e n or
twelve drops may be taken in a glafs o f wine, at feaft twice a-day, for eight o r ten
days. T h e patient's food ought to be nourifhing, but taken in fmall quantities,
and he fhould ufe moderate exercife. A s the ftomach and inteftines are generally
much weakened, an infufion o f the bark, or bitter herbs, in fmall wine, fharpend
with the elixir o f vitriol, may be drunk for fome time.
O f a D I A R R H C E A , o r L O O S E N E S S .
A L O O S E N E S S , in many cafes, is not to be confidered as a difeafe, but ratf&r
as a falutary evacuation. It ought therefore never to be (topped unlefs when it con*
tinues too long, or evidently weakens the patient.
C U R E .— A loofenefs, occafioned by the obitruftion o f any cultom ary evacua­
tion, generally requires bleeding. I f that does not fucceed, other evacuations may
be fubftituted in the room o f thofe which are obftrufted. A t the fame time, every
method is to be taken to reflore the ufual difeharges, as not only the cure o f the
difeafe, but the patient's life, may depend on this. A diarrhoea, or loofenefs, which
proceeds from violent paffions or affections o f the mind, muft be treated with the
greateft caution. V om its in this cafe are highly im proper. N or are purges fafe,
unlefs they be very m ild, and given in fmall quantities. Opiates, and other anti-
fpafmodic medicines, are more proper. T en or twelve drops o f liquid laudanum
may be taken in a cup o f valerian or penny-royal tea, every eight or ten hours, till
the fymptoms abate. Eafe, cheerfulnefs, and tranquility o f mind, are here o f the
greateft importance. W hen a loofenefs proceeds from acrid or poifonous fubftances
taken into the ftomach, the patient muft drink large quantities o f diluting liquors,
with oil or fat broths, to promote vom iting and purging. Afterwards, if there be
reafon to fufpeCt that the bowels are inflamed, bleeding will be neceffary. Sm all
dofes o f laudanum may likewife be taken to remove their irritation. From what­
ever caufe a loofenefs proceeds, when it is found neceffary to check it, the diet ought
to confift o f rice boiled with m ilk, and flavoured with cinnam on; rice-jelly; fago,
with red port; and the lighter forts o f flefh-meac roafted. T h e drink may be thin
water-gruel, rice-water, orweak broth made from lean veal, or with a fheep's head,
as being more gelatinous than m utton, beef, or chicken-broth.
O f V O M I T I N G .
V O M I T I N G may proceed from various caufes, as excefs in eating and drink­
ing, foulnefs o f the ftomach, the acrimony o f the aliments, a tranflation o f the
morbific
C U L P E P E R ' S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . m
morbific matter o f ulcers, o f the gout, the eryfipelas, or other difeafes, to the flo-
mach and bowels.
C U R E .— W hen vom iting proceeds from a foul ftomach or indigeftion, it is not
to be confidered as a difeafe, but as the cure o f a difeafe. It ought therefore to be
promoted by drinking lukewarm water, or thin gruel. I f this does not put a flop
to the vomiting, a dofe o f ipecacuanha may be taken, and worked o ff with weak
camomile-tea. I f vomiting proceeds from weaknefs o f the ftom ath, bitters w ill be
o f fervice. Peruvian bark infufed in wine or brandy, with as much rhubarb as w ill
keep the body gently open, is an excellent medicine in this cafe. T h e elixir o f
vitriol is alio a good m edicine; it may be taken in the dofe o f fifteen or twenty
<lrops, twice or thrice a day, in a g la fs o f wine or water. H abitual vomitings are
fometimes alleviated by m aking oyfters a principal part o f diet. A vom iting,
which proceeds from acidities in the ftomach, is relieved by alkaline purges. T h e
beft medicine o f this kind is the magnefia alba, a tea-fpoonful o f which may be
taken in a difh o f tea or a little m ilk, three or four times a-day, or oftener if necef-
fary, to keep the body open. I have always found the faline draughts, taken in the
a ft o f effervefcence, o f Angular ufe in flopping a vom iting, from whatever caufe it
proceeded. Thefe may be prepared by diffolving a drachm o f the fait o f tartar in an
ounce and a half o f frefh lemon juice, and adding to it an ounce o f peppermint-water,
the fame quantity o f Ample cinnamon-water,and a little white fugar. T h is draught
muft be fwallowed before the effervefcence is quite over, and may be repeated every
two hours, or oftener, if the vom iting be violent.
O f t h e D I A B E T E S .
IN a diabetes, the urine generally exceeds in quantity all the liquid food which
the patient takes. It is thin and pale, o f a fweetifh tafte, and an agreeable fmell.
T h e patient has a continual third, with fome degree o f fever; his mouth is dry, and
he l'pits frequently a frothy fpittle. T h e ftrength fails, the appetite decays, and the
flefh waftes away till the patient is reduced to fkin and bone. There is a heat o f the
bowels; and frequently the loins, tefticles, and feet, are fwelled.
C U R E .— T his difeafe may generally be cured at the beginning; but, after it has
continued long, the cure becomes very difficult. E very thing that ftimulates the
urinary paffages, or tends to relax the habir, muft be avoided. F or this reafon the
patient fhould live chiefly on folid food. H is thirft may be quenched with acids ;
as forrel, juice o f lemon, or vinegar. T h e mucilaginous vegetables, as rice, fago,
and falop, with m ilk, are the m od proper food. O f animal fubftanccs, fhell-fifh
are to be preferred; as oyfters, crabs, & c . T h e drink may be Briftol-water; when
that cannot be obtained, lime-water, in which a due proportion o f oak-bark has
i been
been macerated, may be ufed. T h e patient ought daily to take exercife, but itlhould
be fo gentle as not to fatigue him. H e fhould lie upon a hard bed or mattrefs; no­
thing hurts the kidnies more than lying too foft. Gentle purges, if the patient be
not too much weakened by the difeafe, have a good effed. T h ey may confift o f
rhubarb, with cardamum feeds, or any other fpiceries, infufed in wine, and may be
taken in fuch quantity as to keep the body gently open. T h e patient muft next have
recourfe to aftringents and corroborants. H a lf a drachm o f powder, made o f equal
parts o f alum and the infpifTated ju ice commonly called terra japonica, may be taken
four times a-day, or oftener, if the ftomach w ill bear i t ; otherwife, Peruvian bark
fteeped in red wine. Opiates are o f fervice in this difeafe, even though the patient
refts well. T h ey take off fpafm and irritation, and at the fame time leflfen the force
o f the circulation. T e n or twelve drops o f liquid laudanum may be taken in a cup
o f the patient’s drink three or four times a-day.
O f a S U P P R E S S I O N o f U R I N E .
A S U P P R E S S IO N o f urine may proceed from various caules; as an inflamma­
tion o f the kidnies or bladder, fmall Hones or gravel lodging in the urinary paf-
fages, hard faeces lying in the reftum , pregnancy, a fpafm or contraction o f the
neck o f the bladder, clotted blood in the bladder itfelf, a fwelling o f the haemor­
rh o id s veins, 8cc.
C U R E .— W e would chiefly recommend, in all obftruCtions o f urine, fomenta­
tions and evacuants. Bleeding, as far as the patient’s ftrength will permit, is necef-
fary, Specially where there are fymptoms o f topical inflammation. Bleeding in this
cafe not only abates the fever, by leffening the force o f the circulation, but, by re­
laxing the folids, it takes o ff the fpafm or ftridure upon the veffels which occafioned
the obftrudion. A fter bleeding, fomentations m uft be ufed. Thefe may either
confift o f warm water alone, or o f decodions o f m ild vegetables; as mallows, ca­
momile flowers, and fuch other herbs as are recommended in the H erbal. Cloths
dipped in thefe may either be applied to the pare affeded, or a large bladder filled
with the decodion may be kept continually upon it. Pcrfons fubjed to a fuppref-
fion o f urine ought to live very temperate. T h eir diet fhould be light, and their
liquor diluting. T hey fhould avoid all acids and auftere wines, fhould take fuffici-
ent exercife, lie hard, and avoid ftudy and fedentary occupations.
O f t h e G R A V E L a n d S T O N E .
T H E ftone and gravel may be occafioned by high living; the ufe o f ftrong af-
tringent wines; a fedentary life; lying too hot, foft, or too much on the back; the
conftant ufe o f water impregnated with earthy or ftony particles; aliments o f an
aftringent

aftringentor windy nature, & c. It may likewife proceed from an hereditary difpofi-
tion. Perfons in the decline o f life, and thofe who have been much afflifted with
the gout or rheumatifm, are m od liable to it.
C U R E .— Perfons afllidled with the gravel or (tone fhould avoid aliments o f a
windy or heating nature, as fait meats, four fruits, & c. Their diet ought chiefly to
confill o f fuch things as tend to promote the fecretionof urine, and to keep the body
open. Artichokes, afparagus, fpinnage, lettuce, parfley, fuccory, purflune, turnips,
potatoes, carrots, and raddiihes, maybe fafely eaten. Onions, leeks,andcelleryjare,
in this cafe, reckoned medicinal. T he m oll proper drinks are whey, butter-milk,
m ilk and water, barley-water*, decoftions or infufionsof the roots of marfh-mal-
lows, parfley, liquorice, or o f other mild mucilaginous vegetables, as linleed, lime-
tree buds or leaves, & c. I f the patient has been accuftomed to generous liquors, he
may drink fmall gin-punch without acid. In what is called a fit o f the gravel,
which is commonly occafioned by a ftone flicking in the ureter or fome part o f the
urinary pafiages, the patient m ud be bled ; warm fomentations fhould likewife be
applied to the part afFe<fted, emollient clyflers adminillered, and diluting mucilagi­
nous liquors drunk, & c. T h e treatment in this cafe m ull be the fame as pointed
out for an inflammation o f the kidnies and bladder, & c. Patients who are fubjrlt
to frequent Acs o f gravel in the kidnies, but have no ftone in the bladder, are advifed
to drink every morning, tw o or three hours before breakfaft, an Englifh pint o f oyf-
tcr or cockle-fhell lime-water; for, though this quantity m ight be too fmall to have
any fenfible effect in diflolving a ftone in the bladder, yet it may very probably pre­
vent its growth. W hen a ftone is formed in the bladder, A licant foap, and oyfter or
cockle-fliell lime-water may be taken in the following manner: the patient m ud
fwallow every day, in any form that is leaft difagreeable, an ounce o f the internal
part o f Alicant (bap, and drink three or four Englilh pints o f oyfter or cockle-fhell
lime-water. T h e foap is to be divided into three dofes; the largeft to be taken
fading in the morning early; the fecond at noon; and the third at feven in the even­
ing; drinking with each dofe a large draught o f the lime-water; the remainder o f
which he may take any tim e betwixt dinner and fupper, inftead o f other liquors.
T h e cauftic alkali, or foap-lees, is the medicine chiefly in vogue at prefent for the
ftone. It may be prepared by m ixing two parts o f quick-lim e with one o f pot-alhes,
and differing them to (land till the lixivium be formed, which m ud be carefully
filtrated before it be ufed. I f the folution does not happen readily, a fmall quantity
o f water may be added to the mixture. T h e patient m ud begin with fmall dofes o f
the lees, as thirty.or forty drops, and increafe by degrees, as far astheftom achw ill

I N V O L U N T A R Y difcharges o f blood are fo far from being always dangerous,
that they prove often falutary. W hen fuch difcharges are critical, which is fre­
quently the cafe in fevers, they ought not to be flopped. N o r indeed is it proper at
any time to flop them, unlefs they be fo great as to endanger the patient’s life.
M oft people, afraid o f the fmalleft difcharge o f blood from any part o f the body,
fly immediately to the ufe o f ftyptic and aftringent medicines, by which means an
inflammation o f the brain, or fome other fatal difeale, is occafioned, which, had the
difcharge been allowed co go on, might have been prevented. Periodical difcharges
o f blood, from whatever part o f the body they proceed, m ult not be flopped.
T h ey are always the efforts o f nature to relieve herfelf; and fatal difeafes have often
been the confequence o f obftru&ing them. It may indeed be fometimes neceffary
to check the violence o f fuch difcharges •, but even this requires the greateft cau­
tion. In the early period o f life, bleeding at the nofe is very common. T h ofe
who are farther advanced in years are more liable to b<tmoptocy or difcharges o f
blood from the lungs. A fter the middle period o f life, haemorrhoidal fluxes are
m oft com m on; and, in the decline o f life, difcharges o f blood from the urinary
pafiages. Bleeding at the nofe, to perfons who abound with blood, is very falutary.
It often cures a vertigo, the head-ach, a phrenzy, and even an epilepfy. In fevers,
where there is a great determination o f blood towards the head it is o f the utm oft
fervice. It is likewife beneficial in inflammations o f the liver and fpleen, and often
in the gout and rheumatifm. In all difeafes where bleeding is neceflary, a fponta-
neous difcharge o f blood from the nofe is o f m uch more fervice than the fame
quantity let with a lancet. W henever bleeding at the nofe relieves any bad fym p-
tom, and does not proceed fo far as to endanger the patient’s life, it ought not to
be flopped. B ut, when it returns frequently, or continues till the pulfe becomes
low , the extremities begin to grow cold, the lips pale, or the patient complains o f
being Tick, or faint, it m ull immediately be flopped.
C U R E .— L et the patient be fet nearly upright, with his head reclining a little,
and his legs immerfed in water about the warmth o f new m ilk. H is hands ought
likewife to be put in lukewarm water, and his garters may be tied a little tighter
than ufual. Ligatures may be applied to the arms, about the place where they are
ufually made for bleeding, and with nearly the fame degree o f tightnefs. T h efe
muft be gradually flackencd as the blood begins to flop, and removed entirely as
foon as it gives over. Sometimes dry lint put up the noftrils will Hop the bleeding.
W hen this does not fucceed, doflils o f lint dipped in ftrong fpirits o f wine, may
be put up the noftrils > or, if that cannot be had, they m aybe dipped in brandy.

I f the genitals be immerfed for fome time in cold water, it will generally flop a

A D IS C H A R G E o f blood from the haemorrhoidal veffels is called the bleeding
piles. W hen the veffels only fwell, anddifcharge no blood,but areexceeding pain-
fu l, the difeafe is called the blind piles. T h is difcharge, however, is not always to be
treated as a difeafe. It is even more falutary than bleeding at the nofe, and often
prevents or carries o ff difeafes. It is peculiarly beneficial in the gout, rheumatifm,
afthma, and hypochondriacal complaints, and often proves critical in cholics and
inflammatory fevers.
C U R E .— In the management o f the patient, regard m ud be had to his habit o f
body, his age, ftrength, and manner o f living. A difcharge, which might be excef-
five and prove hurtful to one, may be very moderate, and even falutary, to another.
T h at only is to be efteemed dangerous which continues too long, and is in fuch
quantity as to wafte the patient’s ftrength, hurt the digeftion, nutrition, and other
functions neceffary to life. T h e Peruvian bark is proper in this cafe, both as a
ftrengthener and aftringent. H a lf a drachm o f it may be taken in a glafs o f rod
wine,fharpened with a few drops o f the elixir o f vitriol, three or four times a--
day. T h e bleeding piles are fometimes periodical, and return regularly once a-
month, or once in three weeks. In this cafe they are always to be confidered as
a falutary difcharge, and by no means to be flopped. In the blind piles, bleeding is
generally o f ufe. T h e diet muft be light and thin, and the drink cool and diluting.
It is likewife neceffary that the body be kept gently open. W hen the piles are ex­
ceeding painful and fwelled, but difcharge nothing, the patient muft fit over the
fleams o f warm water. H e may likewife apply a linen cloth dipped in warm fpirits
o f wine to the part, or poultices made o f bread and m ilk, o ro f leeks fried with butter.
If thefe do not produce a difcharge, and the piles appear large, leeches muft be ap­
plied as near them as poflible, or, if they will fix upon the piles, thcmfelves, fo much
the better. W hen leeches w ill not fix, the piles may be opened with a lancet. T he
operation is veryeafy, and is attended with no danger. W hen the pain is very great,
a liniment made o f two ounces o f emollient ointment, and half an ounce o f liquid
laudanum, beat up with the yolk o f an egg, may be applied.

common obfervation, that thofe who have been fubjedl to bleeding at the nofe when
young, are afterwards mod liable to this complaint. It is often occafioned by
excefllvc drinking, running, w id tiin g, fuiging, or fpeaking aloud. Such as have
weak lungs ought to avoid all violent exertions of-that organ, as they value life.
T h ey fhould alfo guard againll violent paflions, exceflive drinking, and every thing

violent cough *

ting o f blood is not always to be confidered as a primary difeafe. Itis often only a
ivmptom, and infom c difeafes not an unfavourable one: this is the cafe in pleu-
rifics, peripneumonies, and lundry other fevers. In a dropfy, feurvy, or confump-
tion, it is a bad iym ptom , and fliews that the lungs are ulcerated.
C U R E .-—T h is, like the other involuntary difeharges o f blood, ought not to be
fuddenly flopped by allringent medicines. It may however proceed fo far as to
weaken the patient, and even endanger his life, in which cafe proper means m ud be
u»cd for retraining it. T h e body fhould be kept gently open by laxative diet, as
roafted apples, Hewed prunes, and fuch-like. I f chefe fhould not have the defired
efTedl, atea-fpoonful o f the lenitive electuary may be taken twice or thrice a-day, as
is found neceflary. I f the bleeding proves violent, ligatures may be applied to the
extremities,as directed for a bleeding at thenofe. I f the patient be hot orfcverifti,
bleeding and fmall doles o f nitre will be o f ufc; a fcruple or h alf a drachm o f nitre
may betaken in a c u p o f his ordinary drink twice or thrice a-day. I f ftrongeratlrin-
gents be ntcefljry, fifteen or twenty drops o f the acid elixir o f vitriol may be given
in a glafs o f water three or four times a-day.
V O M I T I N G o f B L O O D .
T H I S difeafe often proceeds from an obflru&ion o f the m enfesin women, and
fometimes from the flopping o f the hem orrhoidal flux in men. It may be occa­
fioned by any thing that greatly flimulates or wounds the flom ach, as flrong v o ­
mits or purges, acrid poifons, (harp or hard fubflances taken into the flom ach,,& c .
It is often the effect o f obflru&ions in the liver, the fpleen, o rfo m e o f the other
vifeera. It may likewife proceed from external violence, as blows orbruifes, or
from any o f the caufes which produce inflammation. In hyfleric women, vom iting
o f blood is a very common, but by no means a dangerous, fymptom.
C U R E .— A great part o f the danger in this difeafe arifes from the extravafaced
blood lodging in the bowels, and becoming putrid, b y which means a dyfentery or
putrid fever may be occafioned. T h e b e ftw a y o f preventing this, is to keep the
body gently open, by frequently exhibiting em ollient clyfters. A fter the difeharge
is over, as the patient is generally troubled with gripes, occafioned by the acrimony
o f the blood lodged in the inteflines, gentle purges w ill be neceflary.

T H I S dilcharge is more or lcfs dangerous, according to the different circum*
fiances which attend it. W hen pure blood is voided fuddenly without interruption
and without pain, it proceeds from the kidneys > but, if the blood be in fmall quan­
tity, o f a dark colour, and emitted with heatand pain about the bottom o f the belly,
it proceeds from the bladder. Bloody urine is always atcended with fome degree o f
danger; but it is peculiarly fo when mixed with purulent matter, as this (hews an
ulcer fomewhere in the urinary paflages.
C U R E .— W hen there is reafon to fufpeft an ulcer in the kidneys or bladder, the
patient’s diet m ud be cool, and his drink o f a foft, healing, balfamic, quality, asde-
cottions o f marfh-mallow roots with liquorice, folutions o f gum-arabic, & c. Three
ounces o f marfh-mallow roots, and half an ounce o f liquorice, may be boiled in two
Englifh quarts o f water to o n e; two ounces o f gum arabic, and half an ounce o f pu­
rified nitre, may be diffolved in the drained liquor, and a tea-cupful o f it taken four
or five times a-day. T h e early ufe ofadringencs in this difeafe has often bad con-
fequences. W hen the flux is flopped too foon, the grumous blood, by being con­
fined in the veflels, may produce inflammations, abcefs, and ulcers. I f however the
cafe be urgent, or the patient ieems to fuller from the lofs o f blood, gentle aftrin-
gents may be neceflary. In this cafe the patient may take three or four ounces of
lime-water, with halfanounceof thetinclure o f Peruvian bark, three times a-day.
O f t h e D Y S E N T E R Y , o r B L O O D Y F L U X .
T H I S difeafe is known by the flux o f the belly, attended with violent pain o f the
bowels, a conftant inclination to go to ftool, and generally more or lefs blood in the
ftools. It begins, like other fevers, with chillnefs, lofs o f ftrength, a quick pulle,
great third, and an inclination to vomit. T h e dools are at firdgreafy or frothy,
afterwards they are dreaked with blood, and, at lad, have frequently the appearance
o f pure blood, mixed with fmall filaments, refembling bits o f (kin.
C U R E .— N othing is o f more importance in this difeafe chan cleanlinefs. It con­
tributes greatly to the recovery o f the patient, and no lefs to the lafety o f fuch as at­
tend him. E very thing about the patient fhould be frequently changed. T h e ex­
crements (hould never be fuffered to continue in his chamber, but be removed imme­
diately, and buried under ground. A condant dream o f frefh air fiiould be admit­
ted into the cham ber; and it ought frequently to be fprinkled with vinegar, juice o f
lemon, or fome other drong acid. A t the beginning o f this difeafe it is always ne-
ceffary to cleanfe the fird paffages. F or this purpofe a vom it o f ipecacuanha m ud
be given, and wrought o ff with weak camomile-tea. Strong vomits are (eldont
3°* T t nectffary
262
neceflary here. A fcru pie, or at moft half a drachm , o f ipecacuanha, is generally
fufficient for an adult, and fometimes a very few grains will fuffice. T h e day after
the vom it, half a drachm , or two fcruples, o f rhubarb, m ult betaken-, or, what w ill
anfwer the purpole rather better, an ounce or an ounce and a h alf o fE p fo m Tales.
T h is dofe may be repeated every other day for tw o or three times. A fterw ards
fmall doles o f ipecacuanha may betaken for feme tim e. T w o or three grains o f
the powder may be m ixed in a table-fpoonful o f the fyrup o f poppies, and taken
three times a-day. T h efe evacuations w ill often be fufficient to effeft a cure.
Should it happen otherwife, the follow ing aftringent medicines may be ufed. A
clyfter o f ftarch or fat m utton-broth, with thirty or forty drops o f liquid laudanum
in it, may be adminiftered twicea-day. A t the fame time an ounce o f gum -arabic,
and half an ounce o f gum tragacanch, may be diflolved in anE nglifh pint o f barley-
water, over a flow fire, and a table-fpoonful o f it taken every hour. W hen dy-
fenteries prevail, we would recommend a d rift attention to cleanlinefs, a fpare ufe
o f animal food, and the free ufe o f found ripe fruits, and ocher vegetables. W e
would alfo advifefuch as are liable to them to take either a vom it or a purge every
fpring or autumn, as a preventive.
O f t h e J A U N D I C E .
T H E immediate caufe o f thejaundice is an obftruftion o f the bile. T h e patient at
firft complains o f excefiive wearinefs, and has great averfion to every kind o f m o­
tion. H is fkin dry, and he generally feels a kind o f itching or pricking pain over
the whole body. I f the patient be young, and the difeafe complicated with no other
m alady, it is feldom dangerous; but in old people; where it continues long, returns
frequently, or is complicated with the dropfy or hypochondriac fymptoms, it gene­
rally proves fatal. T h e black jaundice is generally more dangerous than the yellow.
C U R E .—-T h e patient fhould take as much exercife as he can bear, either on
horfeback or in a carriage*, w alking, running, and even jum ping, are likewife pro­
per, provided he can bear them without pain, and there be no fymptoms o f inflam­
mation. Patients have been often cured o f this difeafe by a long journey, after
medicines had proved ineflfeftual. I f the patient be young, o f a full fanguine ha­
bit, and complains o f pain in the right fide about the region o f the liver, bleeding
will be neceflary. A fter this a vom it m alt be adminiflered, and, if the difeafe proves
obftinate, it may be repeated once or twice. N o medicines are more beneficial in the
jaundice than vom its, efpecially where it is not attended with inflammation. H a lf
ad rach m o f ipecacuanha in powder w ill be a fufficient dofe for an adult. It may
be wrought o ff with w eak camomile-tea, or lukewarm water. Fom enting the parts
about the region o f the ftomach and liver, and rubbing them with a warm hand or
flefh-
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . >6?
flefh-brufh, are likewife beneficial; but it is ftill more Co for the patient to fit in a
bath of warm water up to the breaft. H e ought to do this frequently, and fhould
continue in it as long as his ftrength will permit. Num berlefs Britifh herbs are
certain cures for this difeafe, as maybefeen in the H erbal. I have known confidera-
ble benefit, in a very obftinatejaundice, from a deco&ion o f hempfeed. Four oun­
ces o f the feed m aybe boiled in two Englifh quarts o f ale, andfweetened with coarfe
fugar. T h e dole is half a pint every morning. It may be continued for eight or
nine days. A very obftinate jaundice has been cured by fwallowing raw eggs.
Perfons fubjeft to thejaundice ought to take as much exercife as poflible, and to
avoid all heating and aftringent aliments. I f it attacks maidens after the age o f pu­
berty, marriage is a certain cure.
O f t h e D R O P S Y .
T H E dropfy is often ow ing to an hereditary difpofition. It may likewife proceed
from drinking ardent fpirits or other ftrong liquors. It is true almoft to a proverb,
that great drinkers die o f a dropfy. T h e want o f exercife is alfo a very common
caufe o f the dropfy. H ence it is juftly reckoned among the difeafes o f the fedentary.
It often proceeds from exceffive evacuations, as frequent andcopius bleedings,
ftrong purges often repeated, frequent falivations, & c. T h e fudden ftoppage o f
cuftomary or neceflary evacuations, as the menfes, the haemorrhoids, fluxes o f the
belly, and, in fhort, whatever obftrutts the perfpiration, or prevents the blood from
being duly prepared, occafions a dropfy. It generally begins with a fwelling o f the
feet and ancles towards night, which, for fome time, difappears in the morning. In
the evening the parts, if prefled with the finger, will pit. T h e fwelling gradually
afeends, and occupies the trunk o f the body, the arms, and the head. Afterwards
thebreathingbecomes difficult, the urine is in fmall quantity, and thethirft great;
the body is bound, and the perfpiration is greatly obftru&ed. T o thefe fueceed
torpor, heavinefs, a flow wafting fever, and a troublcfome cough. T his laft is ge­
nerally a fatal fymptom, as it (hews that the lungs are affetted. W hen the difeafe
comes fuddenly on, and the patient is young and ftrong, there is reafon to hope for a
cure, efpecially if medicine be given early. But, if the patient be old, has led an
irregular or a fedentary life, or if there be reafon to fofpect that the liver, lungs, or
any o f the vifeera, are unfound, there is great ground to fear that the confequences
will prove fatal.
C U R E .-—T h e patient m ult abftain, as much as poffible, from all drink, efpe­
cially weak and watery liquors, and muft quench his third with muftard-whey, or
acids, asjuice o f lemons, oranges, forrel, or fuch like. H is aliment ought to be
dry, o f a ftimulacing and diuretic quality, as toafted bread-, the flelh o f birds, or
i other
other wild animals, roafted; pungent and aromatic vegetables, as garlic, muftard,
onions, creffes, horfe-raddifh, rocambole, fhalor, & c . H e may alfoeat fea-bifcuit
dipt in wine or a little brandy. T h is is not only nourifliing, but tends to quench
third. Some have been actually cured o f a dropfy by a total abftinence from all
liquids, and living entirely upon fuch things as are mentioned above. I f the pa­
tient m ull have drink, the Spa-water, or Khenilh wine, with diuretic medicines
infufed in it, are the bell. Exercife is o f the greatefl importance in a dropfy. I f
the patient be able to w alk, dig, or the like, he ought to continue thefe exercifes as
long as he can. I f he is not able to walk or labour, he m ull ride on horfeback, or
in a carriage, and the more violent the motion fo m uch the better, provided he can
bear it. I f thedifeafe has come on fuddenly, it may generally be removed by
ftrong vomits, brilk purges, and fuch medicines as promote adifeharge by fweat and
urine. F or an adult, h alf a drachm o f ipecacuanha in powder, and half an ounce
o fo x y m e lo f fquills, w ill be a proper vom it. T h is m ay be repeated as often as is
found neccflary, three or four days intervening between the dofes. T h e patient
muft not drink much after taking the vom it, otherwife he deftroys its effc&s. A
cup ortw o o f camomile-tea will be fufRcient to w ork it off. Betwixt each vom it,
on one o f the intermediate days, the patient may take the following purge: Jalap
in powder half a drachm , cream o f tartar two drachm s, calomel fix grains. T h efe
may be made into a bolus with a little fyrup o f pale rofes, and taken early in the
morning. T h e lefs the patient drinks after it the better. If he be much griped,
he may take now and then a cup o f chicken-broth. T h e patient may likewife take
every night at bed-time the following b o lu s: T o four or five grains o f cam phoradd
one grain of opium , and as much fyrup o f orange-peel as is fufiicient to m ake them
into a bolus. T h is will generally promote a gentle fweat, which Ihould be en­
couraged by drinking now and then a Imall cup o f white wine whey, with a tea-
fpoonful o f the fpiritsof hartfhorn in it. A tca-cupful o f the follow ing diuretic
infufionmay likewife be taken every four or five hours through the d a y : T a k e ju n i-
per berries, muftard Iced, and horfc-radifii, o f each h a lf an ounce, afhes o f broom
half a pound *
, infufe them in a quart o f Rhenifh wine or ftrong ale for a few days,
and afterwards drain o ff the liquor. Such as cannot take this infufion, may ufe the
dccotflion o f feneka-root, which is both diuretic and fudorific. I have known an
obftinate anafarca cured b y an infufion o f the allies o f broom in wine. T h e above
courfe w ill often cure an incidental dropfy, if the conftkution be g o o d ; but, when
thedifeafe proceeds from a bad habit, or an unfound ftate o f the vifeera, ftrong
purges and vom its are not to be ventured upon. In this cafe, the fafer courfe is to
palliate the fymptoms by the ufe o f fuch medicines as promote the fecretions, and to
fupport the patient’s ftyength by warm and nourifhing cordials. T h e fecretion o f
urine
164 C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 165
urine may be greatly promoted by nitre. Brookes fays, he knew a young woman
who was cured o f a dropfy by taking a drachm o f nitre every morning in adaughc
o f ale, after (he had been given over as incurable; and a large fpoonful o f unbruifcd
muftard-feed taken every night and morning, and drinking half a pint o f the de­
coction o f the tops o f green broom after it, has performed cures when other power­
ful medicines have proved ineffectual. W hen the difeafe does not evidently and
fpeedily give way to purgative and diuretic medicines, the water ought to be let oft'
by tapping. T his is a very fimple and fafe operation, and would often fucceed, it
it were performed in due tim e; bur, if it be delayed till the humours arc vitiated,
or the bowels fpoiled by long (baking in water, it can hardly be expelled that any
permanent relief will be procured. A fter the evacuation o f the water, the patient’
is to be put on a courfe o f ftrengthening medicines; as the Peruvian bark, the
elixir o f vitriol, warm aromatics, with a due proportion o f rhubarb infuled in wine,
and fuch like.
O f t h e G O U T .
T H E R E is no difeafe which fhews the imperfection o f medicine, or fets the ad­
vantages o f temperance and exercife in a (tronger light, than the gout. Excefs and
idlenefs are the true fources from whence it originally fprang, and all who would
avoid it muft be aClive and temperate. A s there are no medicines yet known that
w ill cure the gout, we fhall confine our obfervations chiefly to regimen, both in and
out o f the fit. In the fit, if the patient be young and ftrong, his diet ought to be
thin and cooling, and his drink o f a diluting nature; but, where the conftitution is
weak, and the patient has been accuftomed to live high, this is not a proper time
to retrench. In this cafe he muft keep nearly to his ufual diet, and Ihould take
frequently a cup o f ftrong negus, or a glafs o f generous wine. W ine-whey is a
very proper drink in this cafe, as it promotes the perfpiration without greatly heat­
ing the patient. It will anfwer this purpofe better if a tea-fpoonful o f fa l volatile
okofum, or fpirits o f hartfhorn, be put into a cup o f it twice a-day. It will like-
wife be proper to give at bed-time a tea-fpoonful o f the volatile tinlture o f
guaiacum in a large draught o f warm wine-whey. T h is will greatly promote
perfpiration through the night. A s the m od fafe and efficacious method o f
difeharging the gouty matter is by perfpiration, this ought to be kept up by all
means, efpecially in the affelted part. For this purpofe the leg and foot (hould
be wrapped in foft flannel, fur, or wool. T h e laft is m od readily obtained, and
feems to anfwer the purpofe better than any thing el(e. T h e people o f Lanca-
ftiire look upon wool as a kind o f fpecific in the gout. T h ey wrap a great quanti­
ty o f it about the leg and foot affelted, and cover it with a fkin o f foft drefled leather.
T h e wool which they ufe is generally greafed, and carded or combed. They clmfe
37. U u chc

the fofteft which can be had, and feldom or never remove it till the fit be entirely
gone off. A ll external applications that repel the matter are to be avoided as death..
T h ey do not cure the diftrafe, but remove it from a fafer to a more dangerous part
o f the body, where it often proves fatal. M any things will fhorten a fit o f the gout,
and fome will drive it o ff altogether *
, but nothing has yet been found which w ill do
this with fafety to the patient. In pain we eagerly grafp at any thing that promiies
immediate eafe, and even hazard life itfelf for a temporary relief. T h is is the true
reafon why to many infallible remedies have been propofed for the gout, and why
fuch numbers have loft their lives by the ufe o f them. It would be as prudent to
ftop the lm all-pox from rifing, and to drive it into the blood, as to attempt to
repel the gouty matter after it has been thrown upon the extremities. T h e latter is
as much an effort o f nature to free herfelf from an offending caufe as the form er,
and ought equally to be promoted. W hen the pain however is very great, and the
patient is reftlefs, thirty or forty drops o f laudanum , more or lefs, according to the
violence o f the fym ptom s, m aybe taken at bed-time. T his will eafe the pain,
procure reft, promote perfpiration, and forward the crifis o f the difeafe. T h o u gh
it may be dangerous to ftop a fit o f the gout by medicine, yet, if the conftitution can
be fo changed by diet and exercife, as to leffen or totally prevent its return, there
certainly can be no danger in follow ing fuch a courfe. It is well known that the
whole habit may be fo altered, by a proper regimen, as nearly to eradicate this dif­
eafe ; and thofe only who have fu/Rcient refolution to perfift in fuch a courfe have
reafon to expe<ft a cure. T h e courfe which we would recommend for preventing
the gout is as fo llo w s: in the firft place, univerfal temperance •
, in the next place,
fuftkient exercife. By this we do not mean fauntering about in an indolent m anner;
but labour, fweat, and toil. Thefe only can render the hum ours wholefome, and
keep them fo. G oing early to bed, and rifing betimes, are alfo o f great im por­
tance. W hen the gout attacks the head or lungs, every method muft be taken to
fix it in the feet. T h e y m uft be frequently bathed in warm water, and acrid cata-
pJafms applied to the foies. Bliftcrs ought likewife to be applied to the ancles or
calves o f the legs. Bleeding in the feet or ancles is alfo ntceffary, and warm fto-
machic purges. T h e patient ought to keep in bed for the moft parr, if there be
any figns o f inflammation, and Ihould be very careful not to catch cold. I f ic at­
tacks the ftomach with a fcnle o f cold, the moft warm cordials are neceflary * as
ftrong wine boiled up with cinnamon or other fpiccs, cinnamon-water, peppermint-
water, and even brandy or rum. T h e patient fliould keep his bed, and endeavour
to promote a fweat by drinking warm liquors; and, if he fhould be troubled with
a naufea, or inclination to vom it, he may drink cam cm ilc-tea, or any thing that
will make him vom it freely. Thofe who never had the gout, but who, from their
conftitution
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
conftitution or manner o f living, have reafon to exped it, ought Iikewife to be very
circum iped with regard to its firft approach. I f the difeafe, by wrong condud or
improper medicines, be diverted from its proper courfe, the miferable patient has a
chance to be ever after tormented with head-achs, coughs, pains o f the ftomach and
inteftines; and to fall, at la d , a vid im to its attack upon fome o f the more no­
ble parts.

O f t h e R H E U M A T I S M .
T H E caufes o f a rheumatifm are frequently the fame as thofe o f an inflammatory
fever j viz. an obftruded perfpiration, the immoderate ufe o f ftrong liquors, and
the like. Sudden changes o f the weather, and all qu ick tranfitions from heat to
cold, are very apt to occafion the rheumatifm. T h e acute rheumatifm commonly
begins with wearinefs, (hivering, a quick pulfe, reftleffnefs, third, and other fymp-
toms o f fever. Afterwards the patient complains o f Hying pains, which are in-
creafed by the lead motion. Thefe at length fix in the joints, which are often af-
feded with fwelling and inflammation. I f blood be let in this difeafe, it has gene­
rally the fame appearance as in the plcurify. In this kind o f rheumatifm the treat­
ment o f the patient is nearly the fame as in an acute or inflammatory fever. I f he
be young and drong, bleeding is neceflary, which may be re la te d according to the
exigencies o f the cafe. T h e body ought likewife to be kept open by emollient
clyders, or cool opening liquors *
, as decodions o f tamarinds, cream o f tartar,
whey, fenna tea, and the like. W arm bathing, after proper evacuations, has often
an exceeding good effed. T h e patient may either be puc into a bath o f warm wa­
ter, or have cloths wrung out o f it applied to the parts affeded. Great care m ud be
taken that he do not catch cold after bathing. T h e chronic rheumatifm is (eldom
attended with any confiderable degree o f fever, and is generally confined to fome
particular part o f the body, as the (houlders, the back, or the loins. There is
1‘eldom any inflammation o r fwelling in this cafe. Perfons in the decline o f life arc
m od fubjed to the chronic rheumatifm. In fuch patients it often proves extremely
obftinate, and frequently incurable. T hough this difeafe may not lcem to yield
to medicines for fome time, yet they ought to be perfided in. Perfons who are fub­
je d to frequent returns o f the rheumatifm, w ill often find their account in ufing me­
dicines, whether they be immediately affeded with the difeafe or nor. T h e chronic
rheumatifm is fimilar to the gout in this refpecl, that the m od proi>er time for ufing
medicines to extirpate it, is when the patient is m od free from the diforder. Therp
are feveral o f our plants pointed out in the H erbal which may be ufed with great
advantage in the rheumatifm. O ne o f the bed is the white mudard-, a table-
Ipoonful o f the Iced o f this plant may be taken twice or thrice a-tlay, in a glafs o f
i68
water or fmall wine. T h e water-trefoil is Ukewife o f great ufe in this complaint *
,
it may be infufed in wine or ale, or drunk in form o f tea. T h e ground-ivy, cam o­
m ile, and feveral other bitters, are alfo beneficial, and may be ufed in the fame man­
ner. N o benefit however is to be cxpeCted from thefe, unlefs they be taken for a
confiderable time. E xcellent medicines are often defpifcd in this difeafe, becaufe
they do not perform an immediate cure j whereas nothing would be more certain
than their effect, were they duly perfifted in. W an t o f perfeverance in the ufe o f
medicines is one reafon why chronic difeafes are fo feldom cured. Cold bathing,
efpecially in fait water, often cures the rheumatifm. W e would alfo recommend
riding on horfeback, and wearing flannel next the fkin. Iflues are likewife very
proper, efpecially in chronic cafes. I f the pain affeCts the fhoulders, an iflfue may
be made in the arm ; but, if it affefts the loins, it fhould be put in the leg or thigh.
O f t h e S C U R V Y .
T H E fcurvy is occafioned by cold moift air ; by the long ufe o f falted or fm oke-
dried provifions, or any kind o f food that is hard o f digeftion, and affords little
nourifhment. It may alfo proceed from the fuppreflion o f cuftomary evacuations-,
as the menfes, the haemorrhoidal flux, & c . It is fometimes owing to an hereditary
taint, in which cafe a very fmall caufe w ill excite the latent diforder. G rief, fear,
and other deprefling paflions, have a great tendency both to excite and aggravate
this difeafe. T h e fame obfervation holds with regard to neglect o f cleanlinefs;
bad clothing, the want o f proper exercife, confined air, unwholefome food, or any
difeafe which greatly weakens the body or vitiates the humours.
C U R E .— There is no way o f curing this difeafe fo effectually, as by purfuing a
plan direCtly oppofite to that which brings it on. It proceeds from a vitiated ftate
o f the humours, occafioned by errors in diet, air, or exercife; and this cannot be
removed but by a proper attention to thefe important articles. W hen the fcurvy
.has been brought on by a long ufe o f falted provifions, the proper medicine is a diet
confifting chiefly o f frefh vegetables; as oranges, apples, lemons, limes, tamarinds,
water-crcflcs, fcurvy-grafs, brook-lime, & c. T h e ufe o f thefe, with m ilk, pot­
herbs, new bread, and frefh beer or cyder, will feldom fail to remove a fcurvy o f
this kind, if taken before it be too far advanced; but, to have this effeCt, they m uft
be perfifted in for a confiderable time. I have often feen very extraordinary effects
in the land-fcurvy from a m ilk diet. T his preparation o f nature is a mixture o f
animal and vegetable properties, which, o f all others, is the m oil fit for reftoring a
decayed conftitution, and removing that particular acrimony o f the humours wh ich
feems to conftitute the very eflence o f the fcurvy and many other difeafes. B ut

with greedinefs flefli and fermented liquors, while m ilk is only deemed fit for their
hogs. T h e moft proper drink in the feurvy is whey or butter-m ilk. W hen thefe
cannot be had, found cyder, perry, or fpruce beer, may be ufed. W ort has lik e,
wife been found to be a proper drink in the feurvy, and may be ufed at fea, as malt
w ill keep during the longeft voyage. A. decoftion o f the tops o f the fpruce fir is
likewife proper. It may be drunk in the quantity o f an E n glifh pint twice a day.
Tar-water may be ufed for the fame purpofe, or decoftions o f any o f the mild muci­
laginous vegetables; farfaparilla, marfh-mallow roots, & c . Infufions o f the bitter
plants, as ground-ivy, the fmaller centaury, marfh-trefoil, & c. are likewife benefi­
cial. T h e peafants, in fome parts ofBritain, exprefs thejuice o f the lad-mentioned
plant, and drink it with good effect in thofe foul fcorbuticeruptions with which they
are often troubled in the fpringfeafon.
O f t h e S C R O P H U L A , o r K I N G ’ S E V I L .
T H I S difeafe proceeds often from an hereditary taint, from a fcrophulous nurfe,
& c. Children who have the misfortune to be born o f fickly parents, whofe confti-
tutions have been greatly injured by chronic difeafes, are apt to be afFc&ed with
the fcrophula. It may likewife proceed from fuch difeafes as weaken the habit or
vitiate the humours, as the fm all-pox, mealies, & c . A t firft fmall knots appear
under the chin or behind the ears, which gradually increafe in number and fize,
till they form one large hard tumour. T h is often continues for a long time with­
out breaking, and, when it does break, it only difeharges a thin watery humour.
Other parts o f the body are likewife liable to its attack, as the arm-pits, groins, feer,
hands, eyes, breads, & c. T h e white fwellings o f thejoints feem likewife to be o f
this kind. T h ey are with difficulty brought to a fuppuration, and, when opened,'
they only difeharge a thin ichor. There is not a more general fymptom o f the fcro­
phula than a fwelling o f the upper lip and nofe.
C U R E .— In this complaint medicine is but o f little ufe. It has been found,
that keeping the body gently open, for fome time, with fea-water, has a good effect.
Bathing in fait water, and drinking it in fuch quantities as to keep the body gently
open, will cure a fcrophula, when medicines have been tried in vain. W hen fait
water cannot be obtained, the patient may be bathed in frefii water, and his body
kept open by fmall quantities o f fait and water, or fome other mild purgative. N ext
to cold bathing, and drinking the fait water, we would recommend the Peruvian
bark. T h e cold bath may be ufed in fummer, and the bark in winter. T o an
adult half a drachm o f the bark in powder may be given, in a g la fs o f red wine,
four or five times a-day. H em lock may fometimes be ufed with advantage in
the fcrophula. Some lay it down as a general rule, that the fea-water is moft pro-
37* X x per
per before there are any fuppuration or fymptoms o f tabes; the Peruvian bark,
when there are running fores, and a degree o f hedtic fever \ and the hemlock in old
inveterate cafes, approaching to the fdrrhous or cancerous ftate. Either the ex­
tract or the frefh juice o f this plant may be ufed. T h e dofe mutt be fmall at firft,
and increafed gradually as far as the ftomach is able to bear it.
O f t h e I T C H ,
T H E itch is fcldom a dangerous difeafe, unlefs when it is rendered fo by negledt,
or improper treatment. I f it be fufFered to continue too long, it may vitiate the
whole mafs o f humours j and, if it be fuddenly thrown in, without proper evacua­
tions, it may occafion fevers, inflammationsof the vifeera, or other internal diforders.
C U R E .— T h e beft medicine yet known for the itch is fulphur, which ought to
be ufed both externally and internally. T h e parts moft affe&ed may be rubbed
with an ointment made o f the flour o f fulphur, tw o o u n ces; crude fal ammo­
niac, finely powdered, tw o drachm s; hogs lard, or butter, four ounces. I f a feru-
ple or h alf a drachm o f th eeflen ceo f lemon be added, it will entirely take away
thedifagreeable ftnell. A bou t the bulk o f a nutm eg o f this may be rubbed upon
the extremities, at bed-time, twice or thrice a week. Itisfeld o m neceflary to rub
the whole body j but, when it is, it ought not to be done all at once, but by turns,
as it is dangerous to (fop too many pores at the fame tim e. Before the patient begins
to ufe the ointment, he ought, if he be o f a fu ll habit, to bleed or take a purge or
two. It w ill likewife be proper, during the ufe o f it, to take every night and morn-
ingas much o f the flour o f brimftone and cream o f tartar, in a little treacle or new
m ilk, as will keep the body gently open. I never knew brimftone, when ufed as
dire£ted above, fail to cure the itc h ; and I have reafon to believe, that, if duly per-
fifted in, it never w ill fail j but, if it be only ufed once or twice, and cleanlinefe
neglected, it is no wonder if the diforder returns. T h e quantity o f ointment men­
tioned above w ill generally be fufHcient for the cure o f one perfon j but, if any
fymptoms o f the difeafe fhould appear again, the medicine may be repeated. It is
both more fafe andefficacious when perfifted in for a confiderable time, than when
a large quantity is applied at once. A s moft people diflike the ftnell o f fulphur,
they m uft ufe, in its place, the powder o f white hellebore root made up into an oint­
ment, in the fame manner, which w ill feldom fail to cure the itch. People ought
to be extremely cautious left they take other eruptions for the itc h ; as the ftoppage
o f thefc may be attended with fatal confequences. M an y o f the eruptive diforders
to which children are liable have a near refemblance to this difeafe j and I have often
known infants killed by being rubbed with greafy ointments, that made thefe erup­
tions ftrike fuddenly in, which nature had thrown out to preferve the patients life,
or prevent fome other malady.

O f t h e A S T H M A ,
T H E afthma is a dileafe o f the lungs, which feldom admits of a cure. Perfons
in the decline o f life are mod liable to it. It is diftinguifhed into the moift and
dry, or humoural and nervous. T h e former is attended with expe&oration or fpit-
tir.gj but in the latter the patient feldom fpits, unlefs fometimes a little tough
phlegm by the mere force o f coughing. A n afthma is known by a quick laborious
breathing, which is generally performed with a kind o f whrezing noife. Sometimes
the difficulty o f breathing is fo great, that the patient is obliged to keep in an ere£t
pofture, otherwife he is in danger o f being fufFocated. A fit or paroxyfm o f the
afthma generally happens after a perfon has been expofcd to cold eafterly winds, or
has been abroad in thick foggy weather, or has got wet, or continued long in a
damp place under ground, & c.
C U R E .— A ll windy food, and whatever is apt to fwcll in the ftomach, is to be
avoided. Strong liquors o f all kinds, efpecially malt-liquor, are hurtful. T h e
patient fiiould eat a very light fupper, or rather none at all, and Ihould never
fufFer himfelf to be long coftive. H is cloathing (hould be warm, efpecially in
the winter-fcafon. A s all diforders o f the breaft are much relieved by keep­
ing the feet warm, and promoting the perforation, a flannel (hire or waiftcoar,
and thick (hoes, will be o f Angular fervice. But nothing is o f fo great impor­
tance in the afthma as pure and moderately warm air. M any afthmatic per­
fons, who cannot live in Britain, enjoy very good health in the fouth o f France,
Portugal, Spain, or Italy. Exercife is likewife o f very great importance in the
afthma, as it promotes the digeftion, preparation o f the blood, & c. T h e blood o f
afthmatic perfons is feldom duly prepared, owing to the proper aftion o f the lungs
being impeded. For this reafon fuch people ought daily to take as much exercife,
either on foot, horfeback, or in a carriage, as they can bear. A lm oft all that can
be done by medicine in this difeafe, is to relieve the patient when feized with a violent
fit. Bleeding, unlefs extreme weaknefs or old age (hould forbid'it, is highly pro­
per. I f there be a violent fpafm about the breaft or ftomach, warm fomentations,
or bladders filled with warm m ilk and water, may be applied to the part affefted,
and warm cataplafms to the foies o f the feet. T h e patient muft drink freely o f
diluting liquors, and may take a tea-fpoonful o f the tincture o f caftor and o f faffron
mixed together, in a cup of valerian-tea, twice or thrice a-day. Sometimes a vomit
has a very good effect, and fnatches the patient, as it were, from the jaw s o f death.
T his however will be more fafe after other evacutions have been premifed. A very
ftrong infufion o f roafted coffee is faid to give eale in an afthmatic paroxyfm. In
the moift afthma, fuch things as promote expectoration or fpitting ought to be ufed;
as the fyrup o f fquills, gum ammoniac, and fuch like. A common fpoonful o f the
fyrup
172
fyrup o f oxym el o f fquills, mixed with an equal quantity o f cinnamon-water, may
be taken three or four times through the day *
, and four or five pills, made o f equal
parts o f afafoetida and gum-ammoniac, at bed-time. L arge dofes o f aether have
been found very efficacious in rem oving a fit o f the afthma. F or the convulfive or
nervous afthma, ancifpafmodics and bracers are the m oil proper medicines. T h e
patient may take a tea-fpoonful o f the paregoric elixir twice a*day. T h e Peruvian
bark is fometimes found to be o f ufe in this cafe. I t may be taken in fubftance,
or infufed in wine. In fhort, every thing that braces the nerves, or takes o ff fpafm,
may be o f ufe in a nervous afthma. It is often relieved by the ufe o f afles m ilk ; I
have likewife known cow s m ilk drunk warm in the morning have a good effeft in
this cafe. In every fpecies o f afthmas, fetons and iflues are o f great fervice; they
may either be put in the back or fide, and fhould never be allowed to dry up. W e
fliall here, once for all, obferve, that not only in the afthma, but in moft chronic
difeafes, ifiues are extrem ely proper. T h ey are both a fafe and efficacious remedy *
and, though they do not always cure the dileafe, yet they will often prolong the
patient’s life.

T H E immediate caufe o f an apoplexy is a compreflion o f the brain, occafioned
by an excefs o f blood, or a collection o f watery humours. T h e former is called a
/anguine, and the latter a ferous^ apoplexy. It may be occafioned by any thing that
increafes the circulation towards the brain, or prevents the return o f the blood from
the head; intenfe ftudy, violent pafiions, fuppreffion o f urine,excefs o f venery, the
fudden ftriking in o f any eruption, wounds or bruifes on the head, longexpofure to
excefiive cold, poifonous exhalations, &rc.
C U R E .— T h e ufual forerunners o f an apoplexy are giddinefs, pain and fwim-
m ing of the head, lofs o f memory, drowfinefs, noife in the ears, the night-mare, a
fpontancous flux o f tears, and laborious refpiration. W hen perfons have rcafon to
fear the approach o f a fit, they fhould endeavour to prevent it by bleeding, a (lender
diet, and opening medicines. In the apoplexy, if the patient does not die fuddenly,
the countenance appears florid, the face is fwclled or puffed up, and the blood-vef-
fels, cfpecially about the neck and temples, are turgid ; the pulfe beats ftrong, the
eyes are prominent and fixed, and the breathing is difficult, and performed with a
fnorting noife, T h e excrements and urine are often voided fpontaneoufiy, and the
patient is fometimes fei2ed with vom iting. In this ftage, every method muft be
taken to leffen the force o f the circulation towards the head. T h e garters fhould
be tied pretty tight, by which means the motion o f the blood from the lower extre­
mities will be retarded. T h e patient fhould be bled freely in the neck or arm, and,
if
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . x:3
if there be occafion, the operation may be repeated in two or three hours. A laxa­
tive clyfter, with plenty o f fweet oil, or frelh butter, and a-fpoonful or two o f com ­
mon fait in it, may be adminiftered every two hours; and bliftering plaifters applied
betwixt the fhoulders and to the calves o f the legs. A s foon as the fymptoms area
little abated, and the patient is able tofw allow , he ought to drink freely o f forne
dilutingopening liquor, as a deco&ion o f tamarinds and liquorice, cream-tartar-
whey, or common whey with cream o f tartar diflblved in it. O r he may take any
cooling purge, as Glauber’s falts, manna diflblved in an infufion o f fenna, or the
like. A ll fpirits and other ftrong liquors are to be avoided. Even volatile falts
held to the nofc dom ifehief. Vom its, for the fame rcafon, ought not to be given,
nor any thing that may increafc the motion o f the blood toward the head. W hen
apoplectic fymptoms proceed from opium , or other narcotic fubftances taken into
the itomach, vomits are ncceflary. T h e patient is generally relieved as foon as he
has difeharged the poifon in this way.
O f t h e H E A R T - B U R N .
W H A T is commonly called the heart-burn is not a difeafe o f that organ, but an
uneafy fenfation o f heat or acrimony about the pit o f the ftomach, which is fome-
times attended with anxiety, naufea, and vomiting. W hen the heart-burn pro­
ceeds from debility o f the ftomach or indigeftion, the patient ought to take adofe
or two o f rhubarb * afterwards he may ufe infufions o f the Peruvian bark, or any
other o f the ftomachic bitters, in wine or brandy. Excrcife in the open air will
likewife be o f ufe, and every thing that promotes digeftion. W hen bilious humours
occafion the heart burn, a tea-fpoonful o f the fweet fpirit o f nitre in a g la fso f water,
or a cup o f tea, willgenerally give eafe. If it proceeds from the ufe o f greafy ali­
ments, a dram of brandy or rum may betaken. I f acidity or fournefs o f the fto­
mach occafions the heart-burn, abforbents are the proper medicines. In this cafe
an ounce o f powdered ch alk,h alf an ounce o f fine fugar, and a quarter o f an ounce
o f gum-arabic, may be mixed in an Englifh quart o f water, and a tea-cupful o f
it taken as often as is neceffary. But the fafeftand beftabforbentis magnefla alba.
T h is not only a£ts as an abforbent, but likewife as a purgative j whereas chalk, and
other abforbents o f that kind, are apt to lie in the inteftines, and occafion obftruc-
tions. I f wind be the caufe o f this complaint, the moft proper medicines are thofe
called carminatives; as annifeeds, juniper-berries, ginger, canella alba, cardamom
feeds, & c. Thefe may either be chewed, or infufed in wine, brandy, or other fpirits.
I have frequently known the heart-burn cured, particularly in pregnant women, by
chewing green tea.

N E R V O U S difeafes not only affcdt the body, but the mind likewife fuffers, and
is often thereby rendered extremely weak and peevifh. T h e low fpirits, timorouf-
nefs, m elancholy, and ficklenefs o f temper, which generally attend nervous disor­
ders, induce many to believe, that they are entirely difeafes o f the mind ; but this
change o f temper is rather a confequence, than the caufe, o f the difeafe. E very
thing that tends to relax or weaken the body difpofes it to nervous difeafes, as in­
dolence, excefllve venery, drinking too much tea, or other weak watery liquors,
frequent bleeding, purging, vom iting, & c .
C U R E .— Perfons afflicted with nervous difeafes ought never to faft long. T h eir
food fhould be folid and nourifhing, but o f eafy digeftion. F at meats, and heavy
fauces, are hurtful. A ll excels fhould be carefully avoided. T hey ought never to
eat more at a time than they can eafily digeft j but, i f they feel themfelves weak and
faint between meals, they ought to eat a bit o f bread, and drink a glafs o f wine.
H eavy fuppers are to be avoided. T hough wine in excefs enfeebles the body, and
impairs the faculties o f the mind, yet, taken in moderation, it ftrengchens the fto-
mach, and promotes digeftion. Exercife in nervous diforders is fuperior to
all medicines. Even change o f place, and the fight o f new objetts, by divert­
ing the mind, have a great tendency to remove thefe complaints. F or this
reafon a long journey, or a voyage, is o f much more advantage than riding Ihort
journies near home. T h o u gh nervous difeafes are feldom radically cured, yet
their fymptoms may fometimes be alleviated, and the patients life rendered, at
leaft, more com fortable, by proper medicines. W hen digeftion is bad, or the fto-
mach relaxed and w eak, the follow ing infufion o f Peruvian bark and other bitters
m ayb eu fed with advantage. T a k e o f Peruvian bark an ounce, gentian-root,
orange-peel, and coriander-feed, o f each h alf an o u n ce; let thefe ingredients be all
bruifed in a mortar, and infufed in a bottle o f brandy or whilkey for the fpace o f
five or fix days. A table- fpoonful o f the ftrained liquor may be taken in half a glafs
o f water, an hour before breakfaft, dinner, and fupper. Few things tend more to
ftrengthen the nervous fyftem than cold bathing. T h is practice, if duly perfifted
in, w ill produce very extraordinary effects; bur, when the liver or other vifeera are
obftrufted, or otherwife unfound, the cold bath is improper. It is therefore to be
ufed with very great caution. T h e moft proper feafons for it are fummer and au­
tumn. It w ill be fufficient,efpecially for perfons o f a fpare habit, to go into the
cold bath three or four times a week. I f the patient be weakened by it, or feels
chilly for alon g time after com ing out, it is improper. Opiates are generally ex­
tolled in thefe m aladies; but, as they only palliate the fymptoms, and generally
afterwards increafe the difeafe, we would advife people to be extremely fparing in
the
J74 C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . *75
the ufe o f them, left habit render them at laft abfolutely neceflary. W hoever wifhes
for a thorough cure o f this difeafe, Ihould pay the ftiicteft attention to diet, air,
exercife, and amufement.
O f t h e P A L S Y .
T H E palfy is a lofs or diminution o f fenfe or motion, or o f both, in one or more
parts o f the body. O f all the affections called nervous, this is the moft fuddenly
fatal. T h e immediate caule o f palfy is any thing that prevents the regular exer­
tion o f the nervous power upon any particular mufcle or part o f the body. T h e
occafional and predifpoftng caufes are various, as drunkennefs, wounds o f the brain
or fpinal marrow, preffure upon the brain or nerves, very cold or damp air, the fup-
preflion of cuftomary evacuations, hidden fear, want o f exercife, or whatever greatly
relaxes the fyftem.
C U R E .— In young perfons o f a full habit, the palfy m uft be treated in the fame
manner as the apoplexy. T h e patient muft be bled, bliftered, and have his body
opened by lharp clyfters or purgative medicines. B ut, in old age, or when the dif­
eafe proceeds from relaxation or debility, which is generally the cafe, a quite con­
trary courfe muft be purfued. T h e diet muft be warm and invigorating, fcafoned
with fpicy and aromatic vegetables, as muftard, horfe-raddifh, & c . T h e drink may
be generous wine, m uftard, whey, or brandy and water. Friction with the flefh-
brufh, or a warm hand, is extremely proper, efpecially on the parts affcfted. Biif-
ters may likewife be applied to the affeCted parts with advantage. One o f the beft
external applications is electricity. T h e fhocks Ihould be received on the part af-
feCted; and they ought daily to be repeated for feveral weeks. Vom its are very
beneficial in this kind o f palfy, and ought frequently to beadminiftered. T he wild
valerian-root is a very proper medicine in this cafe. It may either be taken in an in-
fufion with fage-leaves, or h alf a drachm o f it in powder may be given in a glafs o f
wine three times a-day. I f the patient cannot ufe the valerian, he may take o f fal
volatile oleofum, compound fpirits o f lavender, and tinChire o f caftor, each half an
ounce; m ix thefe together, and take forty or fifty drops in a glafs o f wine, three or
four times a-day. A table-fpoonful o f muftard-feed taken frequently, is a very good
medicine. T h e patient ought likewife to chew cinnamon-bark, ginger, or other
warm fpiceries. Exercife is o f the utmoft importance in the palfy; but the patient
muft beware o f cold, damp, and moift, air. H e ought to wear flannel next his Ikin;
and, if poflible, Ihould remove into a warmer climate.

T H E epilepfy is a fudden deprivation o f all the fenfes, wherein the patient fall.-;
fuddenly down, and is affected with violent convulflve motions. It is fometitnes
x hereditary.
hereditary. It may likewife proceed from frights o f the mother when with child j
from blows, bruifes, or wounds, on the head •
>a collection o f water, blood, or ferous
humours, in the brain; a polypus, tumours, or concretions within the Ikull, excef-
five drinking, intenfe ftudy, excefs o f venery, worms, teething, fuppreflion 'of cufto-
mary evacuations, too great emptinefs or repletion ; violent paffions or affeftions o f
the mind, as fear, jo y , &:c. hyfteric affections, contagion received into the body, as
the infection o f the fm all-pox, meafles, & c . In an epileptic fit, the patient generally
makes an unufual noife; his thumbs are drawn in towards the palms o f the hands,
his eyes are diftorted, he ftarts and foams at the m outh, his extremities are bent o r
twifted various ways, he often difeharges his feed, urine, and fasces, involuntarily,
and is quite deftitute o f all fenfe and reafon. A fter the fit is over, his fenfes gra­
dually return, and he complains o f a kind o f ltupor, wearinefs, and pain o f his
head; but has no remembrance o f what happened to him during the fit.
C U R E .— I f the patient be o f a fanguine temperament, and there be reafon to
fear an obftruCtion in the brain, bleeding and other evacuations will be neceffary,
W hen the difeafe is occafioned by the ftoppage o f cuftom ary evacuations, thefe, if
poflible, m ult be reftored; if this cannot be done, others may be fubftituted in their
place. 1flues or fetons, in this cafe, have often a very good effeCt. W hen there is
reafon to believe that the difeafe proceeds from worm s, proper medicines muft be
ufed to kill, or carry off; thefe vermin. W hen the difeafe proceeds from teething,
the body fhould be kept open by emollient clyftcrs, the feet frequently bathed in
warm water, and, if the fits prove obftinate, a blifter may be put betwixt the fhoul-
ders. T h e fame method is to be followed, when epileptic fits precede the eruption
o f the fm all-pox, or mealies, & c . T h e flowers o f zinc have o f late been highly e x ­
tolled for the cure o f the epilepfy. T h ou gh this medicine will not be found to an-
fwer the expectations which have been railed concerning it, yet in obftinate epi­
leptic cafes it deferves a trial. T h e dofe is from one to three or four grains, which
may be taken either in pills, or a bolus, as the patient inclines. T h e beft method is
to begin with a fingle grain four or five times a-day, and gradually to increafe the
dofe as far as the patient can bear it. M u fk has fometimes been found to fticceed
in the epilepfy. T e n o r twelve grains o f it, with the fame quantity o f factitious
cinnabar, may be made up into a bolus, and taken every night and morning.
Sometimes the epilepfy has been cured by electricity. Convulfion fits proceed from
the fame caufes, and m uft be treated in the fame manner, as the epilepfy.

the m od powerful aromatic and antifpafmodic medicines. T h e principal o f thefe is
rnufk j fifteen or twenty grains o f which may be made into a bolus* and repeated
occaftonally. Opiates are likewife o f fervice; but they m uft be uied with caution.
A bit o f fugar dipped in compound fpirits o f lavender, or the volatile aromatic tine*
ture, may be taken frequently. External applications are fometimes alfo benefi­
cial ; as the ftomach plainer, or a cataplafm o f the Venice treacle, applied to the
region o f the ftomach.
C R A M P OF THE S T O M A C H .
T H I S difeafe often feizes people fuddenly, is very dangerous, and requires imme­
diate afliftance. It is moft incident to perfons in the decline o f life, efpecially the
nervous, gouty, hyfteric, and hypochondriac.
C U R E .— L et the ftomach be fomented with cloths dipped in warm water; or
bladders filled with warm m ilk and water conftantly applied to it. Thefe often
produce the moft happy effects. In very violent and lafting pains o f the ftomach,
fome blood ought to be let, unlefs the weaknefs o f the patient forbids it. W hen the
pain or cramps proceed from a fuppreflion o f the menfes, bleeding is o f ufe. I f they
be owing to the gout, recourfe muft be had to fpirits, or fome o f the warm cordial
waters. Blifters ought likewife, in this cafe, to be applied to the ancles. Violent
cramps and pains o f the ftomach are often removed b y covering it with a large
plaifter o f Venice treacle.
O f t h e N I G H T - M A R E .
IN this difeafe the patient, in time o f fleep, imagines he feels an uncommon op-
prefllon or weight about his breaft or ftomach, which he can by no means fhake oft*.
H e groans, and fometimes cries out, though oftener he attempts to fpcak in vain.
Sometimes he imagines him felf engaged with an enem y, and in danger o f being
killed, attempts to run away, but finds he cannot. Sometimes he fancies himfelf
in a houfe that is on fire, or that he is in danger o f being drowned in a river. l i e
often thinks he is falling over a precipice, and the dread o f being dafhed to
pieces fuddenly awakes him . T h is diforder has been fuppofed to proceed from
too much blood; from a ftagnation o f blood in the brain, lungs, & c . But
it is rather a nervous afte&ion, and arifes chiefly from indigeftion. Hence we
find that perfons o f weak nerves, who lead a fedentary life, and live full, are moft
commonly afflitted with the night-mare. N othing tends more to produce it than
heavy fuppers, efpecially when eaten late, or the patient goes to bed loon after.

fome noife in the fit, they ftiould be waked or fpok.cn to by fuch as hear them, as
the uneafinefs generally goes o ff as foon as the patient is awake, or any one lim b re­
moved *
, but there is oftentimes an univerfal laffitude o f the whole body left be­
hind, which remains for fome fpace o f time. Some fay a dram o f brandy, taken at
bed-time, will prevent this difeafe. T h a t, however, is a bad cuftom , and, in time,
lofes its effect W e w ould rather have the patient depend upon the ufe o f food o f
eafy digeftion, cheerfulnefs, exercife through the day, and a light fupper taken early,
than to accuftom him felf to drams. A glafs o f peppermint-water will often pro­
mote digeftion as m uch as a glafs o f brandy, and is much fafer. A fter a perfon o f
weak digeftion, however, has eaten flatulent food, a dram may be neceffary; in this
cafe we would recommend it as the moft proper medicine. Perfons who are young,
and full o f blood, if troubled with the night-m are, ought to take a purge fre­
quently, and ufe a fpare diet.
T h e night-mare was fuppofed by the ancients -not to be any real diforder o f the
body, but to be an effeft, or fenfation, derived from carnal contact in the night
with fome evil fpirit o r daemon during the hours o f fleep. T h ey contended, that
perfons o f a luftful inclination, who, during the day, indulged in ftrong defires o f
copulation, and had dreams anfwcrable thereto in the night, were frequently vifitcd
by thefe evil fpjrits, whofe bufinefs it was to watch fo r favourable opportunities o f
feducing the mind, already half alienated from virtue and chaftity, to the moft lafci-
vious imaginations, the better to compleac their purpofe o f carnal indulgence and
delight. W hen the weight and opprefiion on the breaft and ftomach produced by
this diforder happened to females, it was called iruubus, or a male monfter j and,
when to males, it was called fuccubus, or afemale daemon, which had contact with the
man, fimilar to the male monfter with the woman i and the laffitude and fatigue left
on the body by the difeafe were fuppofed to be the natural effect o f this abominable
copulation. A bfurd as was the do&rine, whole volum es have been written upon
it •
, and in former days it opened a large field for prieft-crat'c and feduftion o f poor
ignorant unfufpetting girls. H ow many reafons have we to be thankful for the
lights o f the gofpel diipenfed in our own tongue, and for the illuminations o f the
prefent sera!

A L L nervous patients, without exception, are afflicted with wind or flatulencies
in the ftomach and bowels, which arife chiefly from the want o f cone or vigour in
thefe organs. Crude flatulent aliment, as green peas, beans, coleworts, cabbages,
and fuch like, may increafe this com plaint; but llrong and healthy people are lei-

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . m
dom troubled with wind, unlcfs they either overload their ftomachs, or drink liquors
that are in a fermenting (late, and confequently full o f elaflic air. W hile therefore
the matter o f flatulence proceeds from our aliments, the caufe which makes air fe-
parate from them in fuch quantity as to occaflon complaints is almoft always a
fault o f the bowels themfelves, which are too weak either to prevent the produc­
tion o f elaftic air, or to expel it after it is produced.
C U R E .— T o relieve this complaint, fuch medicines ought to be ufed as have a
tendency to expel wind, and, by ftrengthening the alimentary canal, to prevent its
being produced there. T h e lift o f medicines for expelling wind is very numerous;
they often however difappoint the expectations o f both the phyfician and his pa­
tient. T h em o ft celebrated among the clafs o f carminatives are junior-berries ;
the roots o f ginger and zedoary; the feeds o f anife, caraway, and coriander;
gum afafcetida and opium ; the warm waters, tinCturcs, and fpirits, aromatic wa­
ter, tintfture o f woodfoot, volatile aromatic fpirir, jether, & c. For ftrengthening
the ftomach and bowels, and confequently for leflening the production o f flatu­
lence, the Peruvian bark, bitters, chalybeates, and exercife, are the bcft remedies.

T H E S E belong to the numerous tribe o f nervous difeafes, which may be ju ftly
reckoned the reproach o f medicine. W om en o f a delicate habit, whofe ftomach
and inteftines are relaxed, and whofe nervous fyftcm is extremely fenfible, are moft
fubjeCt to hyfteric complaints. In fuch perfons an hyfteric fit, as it is called, may
be brought on by an irritation o f the nerves o f the ftomach or inteftines, by wind,
acrid humour, or the like. A hidden fuppreflion o f the menfes often gives rife to
hyfteric fits. T hey may likewife be excited by violent paflions or affections o f the
mind, as fear, grief, anger, or great difappointments.
C U R E .— T he radical cure o f this diforder will be beft attempted at a time when
the patient is moft free from the fits. It will be greatly promoted by a proper at*
tention to regimen. A m ilk and vegetable diet, duly perfifted in; will often per­
form a cure. If, however, the patient has been accuftomed to a more generous diet,
it will not be fafe to leave it o ff all at once, but by degrees. T h e moft proper
drink is water with a fmall quantity o f fpirits. A cool dry air is the beft. Cold
bathing, and every thing that braces the nerves, and invigorates the fyftem, is be­
neficial; but lying too long in bed, or whatever relaxes the body, is hurtful. It is
o f the greateft importance to have the mind kept conftantly eafy and cheerful, and,
if poftible, to have it always engaged in fome agreeable and interefting purfuic. T h e
proper medicines are thofe which ftrengthen the alimentary canal and the whole ner­
vous fyftem, as the preparations o f iron, the Peruvian bark, and other bitters.
1 Twenty
T wenty drops o f the elixir o f vitriol, in a cup o f the infufion o f the bark, may be
taken twice or thrice-aday. T h e chalybeate waters generally prove beneficial in
this diforder. H yfteric women are often afHi&ed with cramps in various parts o f
the body, which are m oft apt to feize them in bed, or when afleep. T h e moft effi­
cacious medicines in this cafe are opium , bliftering-plaifters, and warm bathing or
fomentations. W hen the cramp or fpafm is very violent, opium is the remedy m oft
to be depended on. Cram ps are often prevented or cured by compreflion. T h u s
cramps in the legs are prevented, and fometimes rem oved, by tight bandages; and,
when convulfions art/e from a flatulent diftenflon o f the inteftines, or from fpafms
beginning in them, they may be often leflenedor cured by m aking a pretty Prong
compreflion upon the abdomen by means o f a broad belt. A roll o f brimftone held
in the hand is frequently uled as a remedy for cram ps: though this feems to owe
its effect chiefly to imagination, yet, as it fometimes fucceeds, it merits a trial.
W hen fpafmsor convulflve motions arife from /harp humours in the ftomach and
inteftines, no lading relief can be procured till thefe are either corrected or expelled.
T h e Peruvian bark has fometimes cured periodic convulfions after other medicines
have failed.

T H E S E generally attack the indolent, the luxurious, the unfortunate, and the
ftudious* and are daily increafcd by luxury and fedentary employments. M en o f
a melancholy temperament, whofe minds are capable o f great attention, and whofe
paflions are not eafily m oved, are, in the advanced periods o f life, moft liable to this
difeafe. It is ufually brought on by long and ferious attention to abftrufe fubjerts,
grief, the fuppreflion o f cuftomary evacuations, excefs o f venery, the rep u lfion of
cutaneous eruptions, long-continued evacuations, obftru&ions in fome o f th evif-
cera, as the liver, fpleen, & c.
C U R E .— Chcerfulnefs and ferenity o f mind are by all means to be cultivated.
E xercife o f every kind is ufeful. T h e cold bath is likewife beneficial; and, where
it does not agree with the patient, friftions with the fkfh-brufh or a coarfe cloth
may be tried. I f the patient has it in his power, he ought to travel either by fea or
land. A voyage or a long journey, efpccially towards a warmer climate, w ill be o f
more fcrvice than any medicine. T h e general intentions o f cure, in this difeafe, are
to ftrengthen the alimentary canal, and toprom ote thefecretions. Thefe intentions
w ill be beft anfwercd by the different preparations o f iron and the Peruvian bark,
which, after proper evacuations, may be taken in the fame manner as directed in the
preceding difeafe.

A S C IR R P IU S is a hard indolent tumour feated in fome o f the glands, as the
breads, the arm-pits, & c. I f the tumour becomes large, unequal, o f a livid,
blackilh, or leaden, colour, and is attended with violent pain, it gets the name o f an
occult cancer. W hen the fkin is broken, and a fames or ichorous matter o f an abo­
minably foetid fmell is difcharged from the fore, it is called an open or ulcerated can­
cer. Perfons after the age o f forty-five, particularly women, and thole who lead an
indolent fedentary life, are m od fubjeft to this difeafe. A cancer is often owing
to fupprefied evacuations*, hence it proves fo frequently fatal to women o f a grofs
habit, particularly old maids and widows, about the time when the mendrual flux
ceafes. It may alfo be occafioned by the long-continued ufe o f food that i$ coo
hard o f digeftion, or o f an acrid nature; by barrennefs, celibacy, indolence, cold,
blows, frittion, preflure, or the like. W om en often differ from the lad o f chefc by
means o f their days, which fqueeze and comprcfs their breads fo as to occafion
great mifehief. T h is diforder feems often very trifling at the beginning. A hard
tumour about the fize o f a hazle-nut, or perhaps fmallcr, is generally the fird fymp-
tom. T h is will often continue for a long time without Teeming to increafe, or giv­
ing the patient great uneafinels; but, if the conditution be hurt, or the tumour ir­
ritated by preffure, or improper treatment o f any kind, it begins to extend itfelf to­
wards the neighbouring parts, by pufhing out a kind o f roots or limbs. It then
gets the name o f cancer, from a fancied refemblance between thefc limbs and the
claws o f a crab. T h e colour o f the Ikin begins to change, which is firtl red, after­
wards purple, then bluifli, livid, and at lad black. T h e patient complains of heat,
■ with a burning, gnawing, (hooting, pain. T h e tumour is very hard, rough, and un­
equal, with a protuberance, or riling, in the m iddle; its fize increafes daily, and
the neighbouring veins become thick, knotty, and o f a blackilh colour. T h e fkin
at length gives way, and a thin lharp ichor begins to flow, which corrodes the
neighbouring parts till it forms a large unfightly ulcer. M ore occult cancers arife,
and communicate with the neighbouring glands. T h e pain and dench become
intolerable; the appetite fails; the ftrength is exhaufted by a continual heiftic fe­
ver ; at lad, a violent haemorrhage, or difeharge o f blood, from fome part o f the
body, with faintings, or convulfion fits, generally put an end to the miferable
patients life.
C U R E .— T h is is one o f thofe difeafes for which no certain remedy is yet known.
Its progrefs however may fometimes be retarded, and fome o f its m od difagrreable
fymptoms mitigated, by proper applications. One misfortune attending the difeafe
is, that the unhappy patient often conceals it too long. W ere proper means ufetl in
3^ 3 A due
due time, a cancer m ight often be cured ; but, after the diforder has arrived at a
certain height, it generally fets all medicine at defiance. W hen a fcirrhous tum our
is firft difcovered, the patient ought to obferve a proper regimen, and to take twice
or thrice a-week a dofe o f the common purging mercurial pill. Some blood may
alfo be let, and the part affe&cd may be gently rubbed twice a-day with a little o f
the mercurial ointm ent, and kept warm with fur or flannel. T h e food m u ll be
light, and an E nglifh pint o f the deco&ion o f farfaparilla may be drunk daily.
Should the tum our not yield to this treatment, but, on the contrary, become larger
and harder, it w ill be proper to extirpate it, either by the knife or cauftic. Indeed,
whenever this can be done with fafety, the fooner it is done the better. It can an-
fwer no purpofe to extirpate a cancer after the conftitution is ruined, or the whole
m afsof humours corrupted, by itT T his however is the common way, which makes
the operation fo feldom fucceed. Few people w ill fubmit to the extirpation till
death flares them in the face •, whereas, if it were done early, the patient’s life would
not be endangered by the operation, and it would generally prove a radical cure.
T h e medicine moft in repute for this difeafe is hem lock. D r. Stork, phyfician at
Vienna, has o f late recommended the extract o f this plant as very efficacious in can­
cers o f every kind. T h e D oflor fays, he has given fome hundred-weights o f it
without ever hurting any body, and often with manifeft advantage. H e adviJes the
patient however to begin with very fmall dofes, as tw o or three grains, and to increafe
the dofe gradually till fome good effect be perceived, and there to reft without fur­
ther increafe. From two or three grains at firft, the D ottor fays he has increafed the
dofe to two, three, or four, drachms a-day, and finds that fuch doles may be conti­
nued for feveral weeks without any bad co n flu en ces. T h e D o& or does not pre­
tend to fix the time in which a cancer may be lefolved by the ufe o f hem lock, but
fays he has given it for above two years in large dofes without any apparent benefit-9
neverthelefs the patient has been cured by perfifting in the ufe o f it for h alf a year
longer. T h is is at leaft encouragement to give it a fair trial. T h e powder o f hem ­
lock is by fome preferred to the extradl. l'h e y are both made o f the frefh leaves,
and may be ufed nearly in the fame manner. D r. N icholfon, o f Berw ick, fays, he
gradually increafed the dofe o f the powder from a few grains to h alf a drachm, and
gave near four drachms o f it in the day with rem arkably good effeds. T h e hem­
lock may alfo be ufed externally either as a poultice or fomentation. T h e fore m ay
likewife be kept clean by injefling daily a ftrong decoftion o f the tops and leaves in­
to it. Few things contribute more to the healing o f foul fordid ulcers o f any kind
than keeping them thoroughly clean. T h is ought never to be negle&ed. T h e beft
application for this purpofe feems to be the carrot poultice. T h e root o f the com ­
mon carrot may be grated, and moiftened with as m uch water as w ill bring it to the
confidence*

confidence o f a poultice or cataplafm. T h is m ud be applied to the fore, and re­
newed twice a-day. It generally cleans the fore, eafes the pain, and takes away the
difagreeable fm ell, which are obje&s o f no fmall importance in fuch a dreadful dis­
order. W ort, or an infufion o f m alt, has been recommended not only as a proper
drink, but as a powerful medicine, in this difeafe. It m ud be frequently made
frefh, and the patient may take it at pleafure. T w o , three, or even four, Englifh
pints o f it may be drunk every day for a conliderable time. N o beneBt can be e x ­
pected from any medicine, in this difeafe, unlefs it be perfifted in for a long time. It
is o f too obftinate a nature to be foon rem oved; and, when it admits o f a cure at all,
it m ud be brought about by inducing an almott total change o f the habit, which
m ud always be a w ork o f time. Setons or iflues in the neighbourhood o f the can­
cer have fometimes good edicts. W hen all other medicines fail, recourfe m ud be
had to opium, as a kind o f folace. T h is will not indeed cure the difeafe, but it wiU
cafe the patient’s agony, and render life more tolerable while it continues. T o avoid
this dreadful diforder, people ought to ufe wholefome food, to take diffident exer-
cife in the open air, and carefully to guard againd all blow s, bruil'es, and every
kind o f predure upon the breads or other glandular parts.

E V E R Y perfon ought, in fome meafure, to be acquainted with the nature and
cure o f poifons. T hey are generally taken unawares, and their effects are often lb
fudden and violent, as not to admit o f delay, or allow time to procure the affidance
o f phyficians. H appily indeed no great degree o f medical knowledge is here ne-
cefiary * the remedies for m od poifons being generally at hand, or eafily obtained,
and nothing but common prudence needful in the application o f them. T h e cure
o f all poifons taken into the domach, without exception, depends chiefly on dif-
charging them as foon as poffible. F or this purpofe the patient fliould drink
large quantities o f new m ilk and fallad-oil till he vom itsj or he may drink warm
water mixed with oil. Fat broths are likewife proper, provided they can be got
ready in time. W here no oil is to be had, frelh butter may be melted and mixed
with the m ilk or water, Thefe things are to be drunk as long as the inclination to
vom it continues. Some have drunk eight or ten quarts before the vom iting ceafed j
and it is never fafe to leave o ff drinking while one particle o f the poifon remains in
the domach. Thefe oily or fat fubdances not only provoke vom iting, but like­
wife blunt the acrimony o f mineral poiion, and prevent its wounding the bow els;
but, if they Ihould not make the perfon vom it, half a drachm or two fcruplesof the
powder o f ipecacuanha m ud be given, or a few fpoonfuls o f the oxymel or vinegar
•of fquills may be mixed w ith the water which he drinks. Vom iting may likewife
be
be excited by tickling the infide of-the throat with a feather. Should thefe methods
however fail, half a drachm o f white vitriol, or five or fix grains o f emetic tartar,
muft be adminiltered. I f tormenting pains are felt in the lower belly, and there is
rcafon to fear that the poifon has got down to the inteftines, clyfters o f m ilk and oil
m ull be very frequently thrown u p ; and the patient m ull drink emollient decoc­
tions o f barley, oatmeal, marlh-mallows, and fuch-like. H e m ull likewife take an
infufion o f fenna and manna, a folution o f G lauber’s falts, or fome other purgative:
A fter the poifon has been evacuated, the patient ought, for fome time, to live upon
fuch things as are o f a healing and cooling q u a lity ; to abftain from flelh and all
llrong liquors, and to live upon m ilk, broth, gruel, light puddings, and other fpoon-
meats o f eafy digeftion. H is drink Ihould be barley-water, linfeed-tea, orinfufions
o f any o f the mild mucilaginous vegetables. T hough vegetable poifons, when
allowed to remain in the ftomach, often prove fa ta l; yet the danger is generally
over as foon as they are difeharged. N ot being o f fuch a caullic orcorrofive na­
ture, they are lefs apt to wound or inflame the bowels than mineral fubftances; no
tim e however, ought to be loft in having them difeharged. F or the bites o f poi-
l'onous animals, a great variety o f certain and immediate cures are pointed out in
the H erbal. For the bite o f a viper, however, the wound Ihould be well fucked,
and afterwards rubbed with warm fallad-oil. A poultice o f bread and m ilk, (oft.
ened with fallad-oil, Ihould likewife be applied to the wound; and the patient ought
drink freely o f vinegar-whey, or water-gruel with vinegar in it, to m ake him
fweat. Vinegar is one o f the bell drinks which can be ufed in any kind o f poifon,
and ought to be taken very liberally. I f the patient be fick, he may take a vom it.
T h is courfe will be fufficient to cure the bite o f any o f the poifonousanimals o f this
country. It is the happinefs o f this ifland to have very few poifonous animals, and
thofe which we have are by no means o f the m olt virulent kind. W e cannot how­
ever make the fame obfervation with regard to poifonous vegetables. Thefe abound
every where, and prove often fatal to the ignorant and unwary. T h is indeed is
chiefly owing to careleflnefs. Children ought early to be cautioned againft eating
any kind o f fruit, roots, or berries, which they do not know •, and all poifonous
plants to which they can have accefs, ought, as far as poffiblc, to be deftroyed.
T h is would not be fo difficult a talk as fome people imagine, were this H erbal kept
in all families, and their children made to read leflons from it, as an eafy occafional
talk. T h is, I think, will appear an indifpenfible duty in parents, when we refle£l,
that feldom a year pafles but we have accounts o f feveral perfons poifoned by eating
hemlock-roots inftead o f parfnips, or fome kinds o f fungus which theyhkd ga­
thered for mulhrooms. Thefe examples ought to put people upon their guard with
Tefpeft to the form er, and to put the latter eatirely out o f ufe. W e m ight here

mention many other plants and animals o f a poifonous nature which are found in
foreign countriesi but, as our obfervacionsare chiefly intended for this ifland, we
fhall pafs thefe over. It may not however be amifs to obferve, for the behoof o f
fuch o f our countrymen as go to Am erica, that an effectual remedy is now faid to be
found for the bite o f the rattle-fnake.— T h e prefeription is as follows : T ak e o f the
roots o f plantain and horehound, in fummer, roots and branches together, a fu/fi*
cient quantity j bruife them in a mortar, and fqueeze out the juice, o f which give,
as foon as pofllble, one large fpoonful; if the patient be fwelled, you mufl: force it
down his throat. T his generally w ill cu re; but, if he finds no relief in an hour
after, you may give another fpoonful, which never fails.— I f the roots are dried, they
m ull be moiftened with a little water. T o the wound may be applied a leaf o f good
tobacco moiftened with rum. W e give this upon the faith o f D r. Brookes, who
fays it was the invention o f a negro *
, for the difeovery o f which he had his freedom
purchafed, and a hundred pounds per annum fettled upon him during life, by the
General Aflem bly o f Carolina.

F R O M whatever caufe an inflammation proceeds, it m ud terminate either by dif-
perfton, fuppuration, or gangrene. T hough it is im poffibletoforetel with certainty
in which o f thefe ways any particular inflammation will terminate, yet a probable
conjecture may be formed with regard to the event, from a knowledge o f the pa­
tient’s age and conftitution. Inflammations happening in a flight degree upon
colds, and without any previous indifpofition, will m od probably be difperfed»thofe
which follow clofeu p on afever,or happen to perfons o f a grofs habit o f body, w ill
generally fuppurate; and thofe which attack very old people, or perfons o f a dropfi-
cal habit, will have a ftrong tendency to gangrene.
C U R E — I f the inflammation be flight, and the conftitution found, the difper-
fion ought always to be attempted. T h is will be belt promoted by a flender dilut­
ing diet, plentiful bleeding, and repeated purges. T h e part itfelf m ufl be foment­
ed, and, if thefkin beverytenfe, it may be embrocated w ith a mixture o f three-
fourths o f fweet oil, and one-fourth o f vinegar, and afterwards covered with a
piece o f wax plaifter. If, notwithftanding thefe applications, the fymptomatic fe­
ver increafes, and the tumour becomes larger, with violent pain and pulfation, it
w ill be proper to promoted the fuppuration. T h e beft application for this purpofc
is afoft poultice, which may be renewed twice a-day. I f the fuppuration proceeds
but (lowly, a raw onion cu t fmall or bruifed may be fpread upon the poultice.

may be opened either with a lancet or by means o f cauftic. T h e laft way in which
an inflammation terminates is in a gangrene or mortification, the approach o f which
may be known by the following fym ptom s: T h e inflammation lofes its rednefs, and
becomes dufkifli or livid 5 the tenfion o f the skin goes off, and it feels flabby 5 lit*
tie bladders filled w ith ichor o f different colours fpread all over it i the tum our fub-
fides, and from a duskifh com plexion becomes black a quick low pulfe, with cold
clammy fweats, are the immediate forerunners o f death. W hen thefe fymptoms
firft appear, the part ought to be drefled with London treacle, or a cataplafm , made
o f lixivium and brans fhould the fymptoms become worfe, the part rauft be fcari-
fied, and afterwards drefled with bafilicum foftened with oil o f turpentine. AH
the drefilngs muft be applied warm. W ith regard to internal medicines, the patient
muft be fupported with generous cordials, and the Peruvian bark exhibited in as
large dofes as theftonuch will bear it. I f the mortified parts fhould feparate, the
wound will become a common ulcer, and muft be treated accordingly. T his article
includes the treatment o f all thofe difeafes, which, in different parts o f the country,
go by the names of bi les, impofthumes, whitloes, & c . T h ey are all abfeefles in con-
fequcnce o f a previous inflammation, which, if poffible, ought to be difeuffed, bur,
when this cannot be done, the fuppuration fhould be promoted, and the m atter dif-
charged by an incifion, if neceflary; afterwards the fore may be drefled with yellow
bafilicum , or fome other digeftive ointment.
O f W O U N D S .
N O part o f medicine has been more m'tftaken than the treatment or cure o f
wounds. It is however a fa d , that no external application whatever contributes
towards the cure o f a wound, any other way than by keeping the parts foft, dean,
and defending them from the external air, which may be as effc&ually done b y dry
lint as by the moft pompous applications, while it is exempt from many o f the bad
confequences attending them. T h e fame obfervation holds with refpeCt to inter*
nal applications. T h efe only promote the cure o f wounds as far as they tend to
prevent a fever, or to remove any caufe that m ight obftruCt or impede the opera­
tions o f nature. It is nature alone that cures wounds *
, all that art can do is to re­
move obftacles, and to put the parts in fuch a condition as is the moft favourable to
nature’s efforts.
C U R E .— T h e firft thing to be done,when a perfon has received a wound, is to
examine whether any foreign body be lodged in it, as wood, (tone, iron, lead, glafs,
dirt, bits o f cloth, or the like. T hefe, if poflible, ought to be extracted, and the
wound cleaned, before any dreflings be applied. W hen that cannot be effected
with
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
with fafety, on accopnt o f the patient’s weaknefs, or lofs o f blood, they m ud be
fuffcred to remain in the wound, and afterwards extracted when he is more able to
bear it. W hen a wound penetrates into any o f the cavities o f the body, as the
bread, the bowels, & c . or where any confiderable blood-veflel is cut, a skilful fur-
geon ought immediately to be called, otherwife the patient may lofe his life. But
fometimesthe difcbarge o f blood is fo great, that, if it be not flopped, the patient
may die, even before a furgeon, though at no great diftance, can arrive. Jn this
cafe, fomething muft be done by thofe who are prefent. I f the wound be in any o f
the limbs, the bleeding may generally be flopped by applying a tight ligature or
bandage round the member a little above the wound. In parts where this bandage
cannot be applied, various other methods may be tried to flop the bleeding, as the
application o f ftyptics, aflringents, & c . Cloths dipped in a folution o f blue vitriol
in water, or the llyptic water o f the difpenfatones, may be applied to the wound*
W hen thefe cannot be obtained, flrong fpirits o f wine may be ufed. Some recom­
mend the agaric o f the oak as preferable to any o f the other ftyptics; and indeed it
deferves confiderable encomiums. It is eafily obtained, and ought to be kept in
every fam ily, in cafe o f accidents. A piece o f it m ud be laid upon the wound, and
covered with a good deal o f lint, above which a bandage may be applied fo tight as
to keep it firmly on; T h ou gh fpirits, tinttures, and hot balfams, may be ufed, in
order to flop the bleeding when it is exceflive, they are improper at other times.
T h ey do not promote but retard the cure, and often change afim ple wound into an
ulcer. People imagine, becaufe hot balfams congeal the blood, and feem, as it were,
to folder up the wound, that they therefore heal it-, but this is only a deception.
T hey may indeed flop the flowing blood, by fearing the mouths o f the vefiels * but,
by rendering the parts callous, they obftrufl the cure. W hen a wound is greatly
inflamed, the mofl proper application is a poultice o f bread and m ilk, foftened with
a little fweet oil or frefh butter. T h is muft be applied inftead o f a plaifter, and
Ihould be changed twice a-day. If the wound be large, and there is reafon to fear
an inflammation, the patient fhould be kept on a very low diet. H e muft abftain
from flefh, flrong liquors, and every thing that is o f a heating nature. If he be o f a
fu ll habit, and has loft but little blood from the wound, he muft be bled ; and, if
the fymptoms be urgent, the operation may be repeated. But, when the patient has
been greatly weakened by lofs o f blood from the wound, it will be dangerous to
bleed him even though a fever fhould enfue. Nature fhould never be too far ex-
haufted: it is always more fafetoallow her to ftruggle with the difeafe in her own
way than to fink the patient’s ftrengthby exceffive evacuations.

IN flight burns which do not break the skin, it is cuflom ary to hold the part near
the fire for a competent time, to rub it with fait, or to lay a comprefs upon it dip­
ped in fpiritsof wine or brandy. But, when the burn has penetrated fo deep as to
blifter or break the skin , it muft be dreffed with fome o f the liniments for burns,
or with the emollient and gently drying ointment, commonly called Turner's ce­
rate. T h is may be mixed with an equal quantity o f frefh olive oil, and fpread upon
a foft rag, and applied to the part affeded. W hen this ointment cannot be had,
an egg may be beat up with about an equal quantity o f the fweeteft fallad oil. T h is
w ill ferve very well till a proper ointment can be prepared. W hen the burning is
very deep, after the firft two or three days, it fhould be dreffed with equal parts o f
yellow bafilicum and Turner’s cerate mixed together. W hen the burn is violent,
or has occafloned a high degree o f inflammation, and there is reafon to fear a gan­
grene or mortification, the fame means muff be ufed to prevent it as are recommend­
ed in other violent inflammations. T h e patient, in this cafe, m uft live low , and
drink freely o f weak diluting liquors. H e muff likewife be bled, and have lus
body kept open. B ut, if the burnt parts fhould become livid or black, with other
fymptoms o f mortification, it will be neceflary to bathe them frequently with warm
camphorated fpirits o f wine, tin d u rc o f myrrh, or other antifeptics, mixed .with a
d ecod ion o f the bark. In this cafe the bark muff likewife be taken internally, and
the patient’s diet m uft be more generous.
O f B R U I S E S.
IN flight bruifes it will be fufficient to bathe the part with warm vinegar, to
which a little brandy or rum may occafionally be added, and to keep cloths wet
with this mixture conftantly applied to it. T h is is more proper than rubbing it
with brandy, fpirits o f wine, or other ardent fpirits, which are commonly ufed in
fuch cafes. In fome parts o f the country the peafants apply to a recent bruife a
cataplafm o f frefh cow-dung. I haveoften feen this cataplafm applied to violent
contufions occafloned by blows, falls, bruifes, and fuch like, and never knew it
fail to have a good effed. W hen a bruife is very violent, the patient ought im m e­
diately to be bled, and put upon a proper regimen. H is food fhould be light and
cool, and his drink w eak, and o f an opening natures as whey fweetened with honey,
decodions o f tam arinds, barley, cream-tartar-whey, and fuch-like. T h e bruifed
part muft be bathed with vinegar and water, as direded above; and a poultice
made by boiling crum b o f bread, elder-flowers, and camomile-flowers, in equal
quantities o f vinegar and water, applied to it. T h is poultice is peculiarly proper
when
i
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 189
when a wound is joined to the bruife. It may be renewed two or three times a-day.
A s the ftru&ure o f the veffels is totally deftroyed by a violent bruife, there often
cnl'ues a great lofs o f fubftance, which produces an ulcerous fore very difficult to
cure. I f the bone be affe&ed, the fore will not heal before an exfoliation takes
place; that is, before the difeafed part o f the bone feparates, and comes out through
the wound. This is often a very flow operation, and may even require feveral years
to be completed. Hence it happens, that thefc fores are frequently miftaken for the
kin g’s evil, and treated as fuch, though, in fadt, they proceed folely from the injury
which the folid parts received from the blow. Patients in this ficuation are peftered
with different advices. E very one who fees them propofes a new remedy, till the
fore is fo much irritated with various and oppofite applications, that it is often at
length rendered abfolutely incurable. T h e belt method o f managing fuch fores is,
to take care that the patient’s conftitution does not fuffer by confinement, or im ­
proper medicine, and to apply nothing to them but fome Ample ointment fpread
upon foft lint, over which a poultice o f bread and m ilk, with boiled camomile-
flowers, or the like, may be put, to nourifli the part, and keep it foft and warm.
Nature, thus affifted, will generally in time operate a cure, by throwing o ff the dif-
eafed pares o f the bone, after which the fore foon heals.
O f U L C E R S.
U L C E R S may be the confequence o f wounds, bruifes, or impofthumes, impro­
perly treated; they may likewife proceed from an ill ftate o f the humours, or what
may be called a bad habit o f body. In the latter cafe, they ought not to be haftily
dried up, otherwife it may prove fatal to the patient. U lcers happen m oll com ­
monly in the decline o f life and perfons who negtedt exercife, and live grofsly, are
m olt liable to them. T hey m ight often be prevented by retrenching fome part o f
the folid food, or by opening artificial drains, as iffues, fecons, or the like. It re­
quires confiderable fkill to be able to judge whether or not an ulcer ought to be
dried up. In general, all ulcers which proceed from a bad habit o f body Ihould be
fuffered to continue open, at lead till the conftitution has been lb far changed by
proper regimen, or the ufe o f medicine, that they feem difpofed to heal o f their own
accord. Ulcers which are the effect o f malignant fevers, or other acute difeafes,
may generally be healed with fafety after the health has been reftored for fome time.
T h e cure ought not, however, to be attempted too foon, nor at any time without the
ufe o f purging medicines and a proper regimen. W hen wounds or bruifes have, by
wrong treatment, degenerated into ulcers, if the conftitution be good, they may
generally be healed with fafety. W hen ulcers either accompany chronical difcafes,
or come in their Head, they m ud be cautioufly healed. I f an ulcer conduces to the
3$* 3 C patient’s
patient’s health, from whatever caufc it proceeds, it ought not to be healed; but
if, on the contrary, it wades the drength, and confumes the patient by a How fever,
it fhould be healed as loon as poffible. W e would earnedly recommend a d rift at­
tention to thcle particulars, to all who have the misfortune to labour under this
diforder, particularly perfons in the decline o f life ; as we have frequently known
people throw away their lives by the want o f it, w hile they were extolling and gc«
neroufly rewarding thofe whom they ought to have looked upon as their execu­
tioners. T h e m od proper regimen for promoting the cure o f ulcers, is to avoid all
fpiccs, falted and high-feafoned food, all drong liquors, and to leflen the ulual
quantity o f flefli meat. T h e body ought to be kept gently open by a diet confid­
ing chiefly o f cooling laxative vegetables, and by drinking butter-m ilk, whey
fweetened with honey, or the like. A fidulous ulcer can feldom be cured without
an operation. It m uft either be laid open fo as to have its callous parts dedroyed by
fome corrofive application, or they m ud be entirely cut away by the kn ife; but, as
this operation requires the hand o f an expert furgeon, there is no occafion to deferibe
it. U lcers about the anus are m od apt to becom e fidulous, and are very difficult
to cure. Some, indeed, pretend to have found W ard ’s filtula pafte very fuccefsful
in this complaint. It is not a dangerous medicine, and, being cafily procured, it
may deferve a trial; but, as thefc ulcers generally proceed from an ill habit o f body,
they will feldom yield to any thing except a long courfe o f regimen, affifted by me­
dicines, which are calculated to correft that particular habit, and to induce an
almoft total change in the conditution.
O f D I S L O C A T I O N S .
W H E N a bone is moved out o f its place or articulation, fo as to impede its pro­
per funftions, it is faid to be luxated or diflocaced. A s this often happens to per­
fons in fituations where no medical affiftancc can be obtained, by which means
lim bs, and even lives, are frequently lod , we (hall endeavour to point out the me­
thod o f reducing the m od common luxations, and thofe which require immediate
affiftance. A n y perfbn o f common fenfe and refolution, who is prefent when a
diflocation happens, m ay often be o f more fervice to the patient than the m od expert
furgeon can after the fwelling and inflammation have come on. W hen thele are
prefent, it is difficult to know the date o f the jo in t, and dangerous to attempt a re­
duction ; and, by waiting till they are gone off, the mufcles become fo relaxed, and
the cavity filled up, that the bone can never afterwards be retained in its place. A
recent diflocation may generally be reduced by cxrcnfion alone, which m ud always
be greater or k fs according to the drength o f the mufcles which move the joint,
the age, robudnefs, and other circum dances, o f the patient. W hen the bone has
t been
i9o C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 191
been out o f its place for any confiderable time, and a fwelling or inflammation has
come on, it will be neceflary to bleed the patient, and, after fomenting the part, to
apply foft poultices with vinegar to it for fome time before the reduction is attempt­
ed. A ll that is neceflary after the reduction, is to apply cloths dipped in vinegar or
camphorated fpirits o f wine to the part, and to keep it perfectly eafy. M any bad
confequences proceed from the neglett o f this rule. A diflocation feldom happens
without the tendons and ligaments o f the joint being ftrecched and fometimes torn.
W hen thefe are kept eafy till they recover their ftrength and tone, all goes on very
w e ll; but, if the injury be increafed by too frequent an exertion o f the parts, no
wonder if they be found weak and difeafed ever after.
D i s l o c a t i o n * of t h e J a w .— T h e ufual method o f reducing a diflocatcd jaw , is
to fet the patient upon a low ftool, fo as an afliftanc may hold the head firm by pref-
fing it againft his bread. T h e operator is then to thruft his two thumbs, being firft
wrapped up with linen cloths that they may not flip, as far back into the patient’s
mouth as he can, while his fingers are applied to the jaw externally. A fter he has
got firm hold o f the jaw , he is to prefs it ftrongly downwards and backwards, by
which means the elapfed heads o f the jaw may be eafily puthed into their former
cavities. T h e peafants, in fome parts o f the country, have a peculiar way o f per­
forming this operation. O ne o f them puts a handkerchief under the patient’s chin,
then, turning his back to that o f the patient, pulls him up by the chin fo as to fuf-
pend him from the ground. T h is method often fucceeds, but we think it a dange­
rous or.c, and therefore recommend the former.
D i s l o c a t i o n of t h e N e c k .— T h e neck may be diflocatcd by falls, violent
blows, or the like. In this cafe, if the patient receives no afililance, he loon dies,
which makes people imagine the neck was broken: it is, however, for the molt
part, only partially diflocated, and may be reduced by almoft any perfon who has
rtfolution enough to attempt it. A complete diflocation o f the neck is inltancaneous
death. W hen the neck is diflocated, the patient is immediately deprived o f all lenl’e
and m otion; his neck fwells, his countenance appears bloated, his chin lies upon
his breaft, and his face is generally turned towards one fide. T o reduce this dif­
location, the unhappy perfon fhould immediately be laid upon his back on the
ground, and the operator m uft place himfelf behind him fo as to be able to lay hold
o f his head with both hands, while he makes a refinance by placing his knees
againft the patient’s Ihoulders. In this pofture he m ull pull the head with confi­
derable force, gently tw illing it at the fame time, if the face be turned to one fide,
till he perceives that the joint is replaced, which may be known from the naile
which the bones generally make when going in, the patient’s beginning to breathe,
and the head continuing in its natural pofture. A fter the neck is reduced, the pa­
tient
192
tient ought to be bled, and fhould be fuffered to reft for fome days, till the parts
recover their proper rone.
D i s l o c a t i o n of t h e S h o u l d e r .— T h e humerus or upper bone o f the arm may
be diflocated in various directions: it happens however m od frequently down­
wards, but very feldom dircCtly upwards. From the nature o f its articulation, as
well as from its expofure to external injuties, this bone is the m od fubjeCt to diflo-
cation o f any in the body. A diftocation o f the humerus may be known by a de-
preflion or cavity on the top o f the (boulder, and an ioaoilicy to m ove the arm.
W hen the diflocation is downward or forward, the arm is elongated, and a ball
or lum p is perceived under the arm -pit; but when it is backward, there appears a
protuberance behind the (boulder, and the arm is thrown forwards coward the
breaft. T h e ufual method o f reducing diflocations o f the (houlder is to feat the
patient upon a low ftool, and to caufe an aftiftant to hold his body fo that it m ay
not give way to the extenfion, while another lays hold o f the arm a little above the
elbow, and gradually extends it. T h e operator then puts a napkin under the pa­
tient’s arm, and caufes it to be tied behind his own n eck ; by this, wnile a fu(H-
cient extenfion is made, he lifts up the head o f the bone, and with his hands directs
it into its proper place. There are various machines invented for facilitating this
operation, but the hand o f an expert furgeon is always more fafe. In young and
delicate patients, it is a very eafy matter to reduce the fhoulder by extending the
arm with one hand, and thrufting in the head o f the bone with the other. In m ak­
ing the extenfion, the arm ought always to be a little bent.
D i s l o c a t i o n of t h e E l b o w .— T h e bones o f the fore-arm may be diflocated
in any direction. W hen this is the cafe, a protuberance may be obferved on that
fide o f the arm towards which the bone is pu(hed, from which, and the patient's in ­
ability to bend his arm, a diflocacion o f this joint may eafily be known. T w o af-
fiftants are generally neceflary for reducing a diflocation o f the elbow ; one o f them
muft lay hold o f the arm above, and the other below, the joint, and make a pretty
ftrong extenfion, while the operator returns the bones into their proper place. A f ­
terwards the arm muft be bent, and fufiiended for fome time with a (ling about the
neck. Luxations o f the wrift and fingers are to be reduced in the fame manner as
thofe o f the elbow, viz. by m aking an extenfion in different directions, and thruft­
ing the head o f the bone into its place.
D i s l o c a t i o n of t h e T h i g h .— W hen the thigh- bone is diflocated forward and
downward, the knee and foot are turned out, and the leg is longer than the other;
but, when it is difplaced backward, it is ufually pulhed upward at the fame time,
by which means the lim b is fhortened, and the foot is turned inwards. W hen the
thigh-bone is difplaced forward and downward, the patient, in order to have it
reduced,
C U L P E P E R ' S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . m
reduced, m ull be laid upon his back, and made fad by bandages, or held by aflif-
tants, while by others an extenfion is made by means o f flings fixed about the bot­
tom o f the thigh a little above the knee. W hile the extenfion is made, the opera­
tor muft pulh the head o f the bone outward, till it gets into the focket. I f the
difiocation be outward, the patient tnufl be laid upon his face, and, during the
extenfion, the head o f the bone m ull be pufhed inward. Diflocations o f the knees,
ancles, and toes, are reduced much in the fame manner as thofe o f the upper e x ­
tremities, viz. by m aking an extenfion in oppofite directions, while the operator
replaces the bones. In many cafes, however, the extenfion alone is fufiicient, and
the bone w ill flip into its place merely by pulling the lim b with fufiicient force. It
is not hereby meant, that force alone is fufiicient for the reduction o f diflocations.
O f B R O K E N B O N E S , & c.
T H E R E is, in moft country villages, fome perfon who pretends to the art o f re­
ducing fractures. T hough, in general, fuch peribns arc very ignorant, yet fome o f
them are very fuccefsful; which evidently proves, th a ta fm a ll degree o f learning,
with a fufiicient lhare o f common fenfe and a mechanical head, will enable a man to
be ufeful in this way. W e .would, however, advife people never to employ fuch
operators, when an expert and fltilful furgeon can be had •
, but, when that is im­
practicable, they mult be em ployed: we ihall therefore recommcnJ the following
hints to their conflderation: when a large bone is broken, the patient’s diet ought,
in all refpe&s, to be the fame as in an inflammatory fever. H e (hould likewife be
kept quiet and cool, and his body open by emollient clylters, or, if theie cannot be
conveniently adminiftered, by food chat is o f an opening q u ality; as ftewed prunes,
apples boiled in m ilk, boiled fpinage, and the like. It ought however to be here
remarked, that perfons who have been accuftomcd to live high are not all o f a
fudden to be reduced to a very low diet. T his might have fatal cficCh. There is
often a neceflity for indulging even bad habits, in fome meafure, where the nature
o f the difeafe might require a different treatment. It will generally be neceflary to
bleed the patient immediately after a fraCfcure, efpecially if he be young, o f a full
habit, or has, at the fame time, received any bruife or contufion. T his operation
fhould not only be performed foon after the accident happens, but, if the patient be
very feverifh, it may be repeated next day. W hen fcveral o f the ribs are broken,
bleeding is peculiarly neceflary. I f any o f the large bones which fupport the body
are broken, the patient muft keep his bed for fcveral weeks. It is by no means ne­
ceflary, however, that he fhould lie all that time, as is cuftomary, upon his back.
T h is fituation finks the fpirits, galls and frew the patient’s fkin, and renders him
very uneafy. A fter th$ fecond week he may be gently raifed up, and may fit feveral
3$f. 3 D hours,
194
hours, fopported by a bed-chair, or the like, which will greatly relieve him. G reat
care, however, m aft be taken in railing him up, and laying him down, that he make
no exertions himfelf, otherwife the aftion o f the mufcles may pull the bone out o f
its place. It has been cuftomary, when a bone was broken, to keep the lim b for
five or fix weeks continually upon the ftretch. B ut this is a bad pofture. Ic is
both uneafy to the patient and unfavourable to the cure. T h e beft; fituation is to
keep the limb a little bent. T h is is the pofture into which every animal puts its
limbs when it goes to reft, and in which feweft mufcles are upon the ftretch. It is
eafily effected, by either laying the patient upon his fide, or m aking the bed fo as to
favour this pofition o f the limb. A ll that art can do towards the cure o f a broken
bone, is to lay it perfectly ftraight, and to keep it quite eafy. A ll tight bandanges
do hurt. T h ey had much better be wanting altogether. A great many o f the bad
confequences which fucceed to fra&ured bones are owing to tight bandages. T h e
beft method o f retention is by two or more fplints made o f leather or pafteboard.
T hefe, if moiftened before they be applied, foon afiiime th e fh a p e o f the included
member, and are fufficient, by the afliftance o f a very flight bandage, for all the
purpofes o f retention. T h e fplints fhould always be as long as the lim b, with holes
cut for the ancles when the fracture is in the leg. In fractures o f the ribs, where a
bandage cannot be properly ufed, an adheflve plaifter may be applied over the part.
T h e patient, in this cafe, ought to keep him felf quite eafy, avoiding every thing that
may occafion fneezing, laughing, coughing, or the like. H e ought to keep his
body in a ftraight pofture, and fhould take care that his ftomach be conftantly dif-
tended, by taking frequently feme light food, and drinking freely o f weak watery
liquors. T h e moft proper external application fo r a frafture is oxycratey o r a
mixture o f vinegar and water. T h e bandages fhould be wet with this at every
drefling.
O f S T R A I N S .
S T R A I N S are often attended with worfe confequences than broken bones. T h e
reafon is obvious, they are generally negledtcd. W hen a bone is broken, the patient
is obliged to keep the member eafy, becaufe he cannot m ake ufe o f i t * bur, when
a joint is only (trained, the perfon, finding he can (till make a fhift to move it, is
forry to lofe his time for fo trifling an ailment. In this way he deceives himfelf, and
converts into an incurable malady what m ight have been removed by only keeping
the part eafy for a few days. Country people generally immerfe a (trained lim b in
cold water. T h is is very proper, provided it be done immediately, and not kept in
too long. B ut the cuftom o f keeping the part immerfed in cold water for a long
time, is certainly dangerous. It relaxes inftead o f bracing the part, and is more
I likely

likely to produce a difeafe chan remove one. W rapping a garter, or Come other
bandage, pretty tight about the ftrained parr, is likewife o f ufe. It helps to restore
the' proper tone o f the veffels, and prevents the action o f the parts from increafing
thetfifeafe. It fhould not however be applied too tight. Bleeding near the af­
fected part will frequently have a very good effect: but what we would recom­
mend above all is eafe. It is more to be depended on than any medicine, and fcl-
dom fails to remove the complaint.
O f R U P T U R E S.
C H IL D R E N and very old people are moft liable to this difeafe. In the former
it is generally occafioned by exceflive crying, coughing, vom iting, or the like. In
the latter, it is commonly the effelfc o f blows or violent exertions o f the ftrength, as
leaping, carrying great weights, & c. In both, a relaxed habit, indolence, and an
oily or very moift diet, difpofe the body to this difeafe. A rupture fometimes proves
fatal before it is difeovered. W henever ficknefs, vom iting, and obftinate coftive-
nefs, give reafon to fufpelt an obftrultion o f the bowels, all thofe places where rup­
tures ufually happen ought carefully to be examined. T h e protrufion o f a very
fmall part o f the gut will occafion all thefe fymptoms ; and, if not returned in due
time, will prove mortal. O n the firft appearance o f a rupture in an infant, it ought
to be laid upon its back, with its head very low. W hile in this pofture, if the gu t
does not return o f itfelf, it m ay eafily be put up by gentle preffure. A fter it is re­
turned, a piece o f fticking-plaifter may be applied over the part, and a proper trufs
or bandage muft be conftantly worn for a confiderable time. T h e method o f m ak­
ing and applying theie rupture-bandages for children is pretty well known. T h e
child muft, as far as poffible, be kept from crying, and from ail violent motion, till
the rupture is quite healed. In adults, when the gut has been forced down with
great violence, or happens, from any caufe, to be inflamed, there is often great dif­
ficulty in returning it. T h e patient fhould be bled ♦, after which, he muft be laid
upon his back, with his head very low, and his breech railed high with pillows. In
this fituation flannel cloths wrung out o f a decoction o f mallows and camomile?
flowers, or, if thefe are not ac hand, o f warm water, muft be applied for a confider-
able time. A clyfter made o f this decoition, with a large fpoonful o f butter and a
little fait, may be afterwards thrown up. I f thefe fhould not prove fuccefsful, re-
courfe muft be had to preffure. I f the tumour be very hard, confiderable force will
be necelfary * but it is not force alone which fucceeds here. T h e operator, at the
fame time that he makes a preffure with the palms o f his hands, muft with his fingers
artfully conduit the gut in b y the fame aperture through which it came out. T h e
manner o f doing this can be m uch eafier conceived than deferibed. Should thefe
endeavours
endeavours prove ineffectual, clyfters o f the fmoke o f tobacco may be tried. Thefe
have been often known to fucceed where every other method failed. A n adult, af­
ter the gut has been returned, muft wear a fteel bandage. It is needlefs tpj de-
feribe this, as it may always be had ready-made from the artifts. Such bandages
are generally irkfome to the wearer for fome time, but by cuftom they become quite
eafy. N o perfon who has had a rupture after he arrived at man's eftate lhould ever
be without one o f thefe bandages. Perfons who have a rupture ought carefully to
avoid all violent exercife, carrying great weights, leaping, running, and the like.
T h ey tfiould likewife avoid windy aliment and ftrong liquors; and fhould carefully
guard againft catching cold.

W H E N a perfon has remained above a quarter o f an hour under water, there can
be no confiderable hopes o f recovery. B ut, as feveral circumftances may happen
to have continued life, in fuch an unfortunate fituation, beyond the ordinary term,
we fhould never too foon refign the unhappy objeCl to his fate, but try every m e­
thod for his relief, as there are many well-attefted proofs o f the recovery o f perfons
to life and health who had been taken out o f the water apparently dead, and w ho
remained a confiderable time without exhibiting any figns o f life. T h e firft thing
to be done, after the body is taken out o f the water, is to convey it, as foon as pof-
fible, to fomc convenient place where the neceflary operations for its recovery may­
be performed. In attem pting to recover perfons apparently drowned, the principal
intention to be purfued is, to reftore the natural warm th, upon which all the vital
functions depend; and to excite thefe functions by the application o f ftim ulants,
not only to the (kin, but likewife to the lungs, intertines, See, T h ou gh cold was by
ro means the caufe o f the perfon's death, yet it will prove an effectual obftacle to his
recovery. For this reafon, after dripping him o f his wet clothes, his body m uft be
ftrongly rubbed for a confiderable time with coarfe linen cloths, as warm as they can
be made j and, as foon as a well-heated bed can be got ready, he may be laid in it,
and the rubbing Ihould be continued. W arm cloths ought likewife to be frequent­
ly applied to the ftomach and bowels, and hot bricks, or bottles o f warm water, to
the foies o f the feet, and to the palms o f the hands. Strong volatile fpirits (hould be
frequently applied to the uofe; and the fpineof the back and pic o f the ftomach
may be rubbed with warm brandy or fpirit o f wine. T h e temples ought always to
be chafed with volatile fpirits; and Itimulating powders, as that o f tobacco or mar* )
joram , may be blown u p the noftrils. T o renew the breathing, a ltrong perfon may
blow his own breath into the patient’s mouth with all the force he can, holding his
nortrils at the fame tim e. W hen it can be jperceived, by the riling o f the chert or
belly,

belly, that the lungs are filled with air, the perfon ought to defift from blowing, and
(hould prefsthe bread: and belly fo as to expel the air again ; and this operation may
be repeated for fome time, alternately inflating and deprefling the lungs fo as to imi­
tate natural refpiration. B u t the author, after along and laborious courfe o f prafti-
cal chemiftry, has difcovereda liquid medium called the S O L A R T I N C T U R E ,
which poflefling all the properties o f animated blood, w ill, by being poured into the
ftomach, reanimate, and reftore fufpended life ; and, for this benevolent purpofe,
it fuperfedes every other a ft and invention, Thofe who have ftudied the admira­
ble conftruftion o f the human machine know, that its difTolution cannot naturally
happen but by a general decay o f the whole fyftem, when the vefTels become imper­
vious to the fluids, the circulation weakened or deftroyed, and the vital organs no
longer able to perform their office. But, when their functions are merely fufpended
by fome fuddenftiock, it may be likened to the ftate o f a watch flopped by a fall,
which refumes its motion the inftant that injury is repaired. In the animal cecono-
m y, “ the B L O O D is the L I F E t h e r e f o r e , if its circulation be fufpended or de-
flroyed, death follows. B ut if the blood can be re-agitated, and its circulation re­
fumed, life will o f neceflity be reftored. For this purpofe let two or three table
fpoonfuls o f the Solar T in ftu re be introduced as early as poffible into the
ftomach, and rubbed profufely in by a warm hand, upon the fp in eof the back,
loins, breaft, and region o f the heart, and poured into the wound, if there
be any, the warm ftimulating quality o f the medicine, afllfted by the exter­
nal heat and friftion, w ill rouze the ftagnant blood and juices, particularly in the
grandrefervoirthe heart, where rarefying, prefling every way, and being refilled by
the valves, will fwell fo asto fill the flaccid right auricle o f the heart, which by the
(hock had become empty and at reft; and thus ftim ulating its fibres, will put them
into motion. T h e right auricle being thus filled, and ftimulated into contraction,
fills the ventricle; which, by this means being irritated, likewile contracts and emp­
ties itlelf into the pulmonary artery; and, the moment this is done, the circulation
begins again where it left off*, and the lungs, being filled by thcdephlogifticaccd air
contained in the medicine, begin to aft, and life is reftored, provided the organs and
juices are in a fit difpofition for it, which they undoubtedly are m uch oftener than is
imagined. N or is this ftimulating aftion o f the T infture upon the heart at all fur-
prifing; for every medical man knows, or ought to know , that the heart, even after
it is taken out o f the body, if it be pricked with a pin, or hath warm water thrown
upon it, will beat afrefti, and endeavour to exert its funftions, though for fome time
before it had been motionlefs. N o perfon therefore ought to be confidered dead, un­
til the energy o f the blood is fofar gone, that it can never again be agitated fo as to
fill and (limulate into contraftion the right Jinus venofus and auricle o f the heart.
T o demonftrate the reanimating powers o f this medicine, experiments may be made

they are apparently dead, or piercing them through the head, or any part o f the bo*
dyexcept the heart; by luffocation, or an elettrical fhock ; forfudden death, how-
tbever it happens, whether by drowning or otherwise, is much the fame as to its e f­
fects on the vital organs, confequently they are all to be treated in a fimilar manner.
T h is medicine is likewife an abfolutecure for the fcurvy, in its m oll advanced fta-
ges*, and isafovereign remedy for relaxations, debility, laflitude, tremors, finking
o f the fpirits,and all thofe nervous afteftio.ns which harrafs and opprefs the w eak,
fedentary, and delicate, and are often the confequences o f high living, and luxuriant
indulgences, without bodily exercife and frefh air. In all thefe cafes, the Solar
T in ftu re is calculated to warm and fteady the cold tremulous nerves; to fheath and
invigorate the m ufcular fyftem ; to animate the fpirits *
, and renovate the whole man,
whereby the chill watery fluids become rich and balfamic, and the circulation re­
fumes its healthful ftate. It may be had o f every flationer who fells my works.

C O N V U L S I O N fits often conftitute the laft feen e o f acute or chronic difor-
ders. W hen this is the cafe, there can remain but fmall hopes o f the patient’s re­
covery after expiring in a fit. B ut when a perfon, who appears to be in perfect
health, is fuddenly feized with a convulfion fit, and feems to expire, fome attempts
ought always to be made to reftore him to life. Infants are m oil liable to convul-
fions, and are often carried o ff very fuddenly by one or more fits about the tim e o f
teething. There are many well-authenticated accounts o f infants having been re-
ftored to life, after they had to all appearance expired in convulfions; but we Ihall
only relate the follow ing inftance mentioned by D r. Johnfon in his pamphlet on the
practicability o f recovering perfons vifibly dead: In the parilh o f St. Clemens, at
Colchefter, a child o f fix months old, lying upon its mother’s lap, having had the
bread, was feized w ith a ftrong convulfion fit, which laded fo long, and ended with
lb total a privation o f motion in the body, lungs, and pulfe, that it was deemed
abfolutely dead. It was accordingly ftripi>ed, laid out, the pafling-bell ordered to
be tolled, and a coffin to be made; but a neighbouring gentlewoman, who ufed to
admire the child, hearing o f its fudden death, hailened to the houfe, and upon exa­
mining the child found it not cold, its joints lim ber, and fancied that a glafs fhe
held to its mouth and nofe was a little damped with the breath ; upon which fhe
took the child in her lap, fat down before the fire, rubbed it, and kept it in gentle
agitation. In a quarter o f an hour fhe felt the heart begin to beat faintly; Ihe then
put a little o f the mother’s m ilk into its mouth, continued to rub its palms and
foies, found the child begin to move, and the m ilk was fwallowed ; and in another
quarter o f an hour Ihe had the fatisfa&ion o f reftoring to its difconfolate mother the
babe
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . m
babe quite recovered, eager to lay hold o f the breaft, and able to fuck again. T he
child throve, had no more fits, is grown up, and at prefent alive. There are many
other things which might be done, in cafe the above fhould not fuccecd; as rubbing
the body with ftrong fpirits, covering it with warm afties or falc, blowing air into
the lungs, throwing up warm ftimulating clyfters, or the fmoke o f tobacco, into
the inteftines, and fuch-like. W hen children are dead born, or expire foon after
the birth, the fame means ought to be ufed for their recovery as if they had expired
in circumftances fimilar to thofe mentioned above. Thefe directions may likewife
be extended to adults, attention being always paid to the age and other circum­
ftances o f the patient. T h e rtteafts ufed with fo much efficacy in recovering
drowned perfons are, with equal fuccefs, applicable to a number o f cafes where the
powers o f life feem in reality to be only fufpended, and to remain capable o f renew­
ing all their functions, on being put into motion again. It is (hocking to reflect,
that for want o f this confideration many perfons have been committed to the grave,
in whom the principles o f life might have been revived. T h e cafes wherein fuch
endeavours are m od likely to be attended with fuccefs, are all thofe called fudden
deathsfrom an invifible caufe, as apoplexies, hyfterics, faintings, and many other
diforders wherein perfons in a moment fink down and expire. T h e various cafual-
ties in which they may be tried are, fuffocations from the fulphureous damps o f
mines, coal-pits, & c. the unwholefome air o f long-unopened wells or caverns; the
noxious vapours arifing from fermenting liquors \ the (teams o f burning charcoal *
fulphureous mineral acids j arfenical effluvia, & c. &c»
O f C O L D B A T H I N G .
IM M E R S IO N in cold water is a cuftom which lays claim to the molt remote
antiquity: indeed it muft have been coeval with man himfelf. T h e neceflity o f
water for the purpofesof cleanlinefs, and the pleafure arifing from its application to
the body in hot countries, m uft very early have recommended it to the human fpe-
cies. Even the example o f other animals was fufficientto give the hint to man. B y
inftinCt many o f them are led to apply cold water in this m anner; and feme, when
deprived o f its ufe, have been known to languifh, and even to die. But whether the
practice o f cold bathing arofe from neceflity, reafoning, or imitation, is an inquiry o f
no importance-, our bufinefs is to point out the advantages which may be derived
from it, and to guard people againft an improper ufe o f it. T h e cold bath recom­
mends itfelf in a variety o f cafes and is peculiarly beneficial to the inhabitants o f
populous cities, who indulge in idlenefs and lead fedentary lives. In perfons o f this
defcription the aftion o f the fofids is always too weak, which induces a languid
circulation, a crude indigefted m afsof humours, and obftruftions in thecapillary
i vcflels
2C
O
veflels and glandular fyftem . C old water, from its gravity, aswell as its tonic power,
is well calculated either to obviate or remove thefe fymptoms. It accelerates the
motion o f the blood, promotes the different fecretions, and gives permanent vigour
to the folids. B ut all thefe important purpofes w ill be more efientially anfwered by
the application o f fait water* T h is ought not only to be preferred on account o f
its fuperior gravity, but likewife for its greater power o f Sim ulating the skin, which
promotes the perfpiradon, and prevents the patient from catching cold. It is ne-
ceflary, however, to obferve, that cold bathing is more likely to prevent than to
remove obftru&ions o f the glandular or lym pahatic fyftem. Indeed, when thefe
have arrived at a certain pitch, they are not to be removed by any m ean?' In this
cafe the cold bath w ill only aggravate the fymptoms, and hurry the unhappy patient
into an untimely grave. It is therefore o f the utm oft importance, previous to the
patient’s entering upon the ufe o f the cold bath, to determine whether or not he la­
bours under any obftinate obftrudlions o f the lungs or other vifcera; and, where
this is the cafe, cold bathing ought ftriftly to be prohibited. In what is called a
plethoric ftate, or too great a fulnefs o f the body, it is likewife dangerous to ufe the
cold bath, without due preparation. In this cafe there is great danger o f burfting a
blood-veflel, or occafioning an inflammation o f the brain, or fome o f the vifcera.
T h is precaution is the more neceflary to citizens, as moft o f them live fu ll, and are
o f a grofs habit. Y e t, whar is very remarkable, thefe people refort in crouds every
feafon to the fea-fide, and plunge in the water w ithout the leaft co n fu tatio n . N o
doubt they often efcape with impunity, but does this give a fanttiontothe practice?
Perfons o f this defeription ought by no means to bathe, unlefs the body has been
previoufly prepared by fuitable evacuations. Another cla fso f patients, who ftand
peculiarly in need o f the bracing qualities o f cold water, is the nervous. 'Phis in­
cludes a great num ber o f the male, andalm oft all the female, inhabitants o f great
cities. Y et even thofe perfons ought to be cautious in ufing the cold bath. N er­
vous people have often weak bowels,and may, as well as other, be fubjeft to con-
geftions an d obftru d ionsof the vifcera*, and in this cafe they will not be able to bear
the effects o f the cold water. For them, therefore, and indeed for all delicate people,
the belt plan would be to accuftom themfelves to it by the moft pleafing and gentle
degrees. T h ey ought to begin with the temperate bath, and gradually ufe it cooler,
till at length the coldeft proves quite agreeable. N ature revolts againft all great
tranfitions; and thofe who do violence to her di&ates have often caufe to repent o f
their temerity. T o young people, and particularly to children, cold bathing is o f
the laft importance. T h eir lax fibres render its tonic powers peculiarly proper. It
promotes their grow th, increafes their ftrength, and prevents a variety o f difeafes
incident to childhood. T h e moft proper time o f the day for ufing the cold bath is
no
C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 201
no doubt the morning, or at leaft before dinner; and the beft mode, that o f quick
immerfion. A s cold bathing has a conftant tendency to propel the blood and other
humours towards the head, it ought to be a rule always to wet that part as foon as
poflible. By due attention to this circuniftance, there is reafon to believe, that vio-
lent head-achs, and other complaints, which frequently proceed from cold bathing,
might be often prevented. T h e cold bath, when too long continued in, not only
occafions‘ an exceffive flux o f humours towards the head, but chills the blood,
cramps the mulcles, relaxes the nerves, and wholly deteats the intention o f bathing.
Hence, fey not adverting to this circumftance, expert fwimmers are often injured,
and fomtftimes even lofe their lives. A ll the beneficial purpofes o f cold bathing
are anfwered by one fingle im m erfion; and the patient ought to be rubbed dry the
moment he comes out o f the water, and fliould continue to take txercife for fomc
time after. W hen cold bathing occafions chilncfs, lofs o f appetite, lifUcflhefs, pain
o f the breaft or bowels, a proftration o f ftrength, or violent head-achs, it ought to
be difeontinued.

T H E waters moft in ufe for medical purpofes in Britain, are thofe impregnated
with fairs, fulphur, iron, and mephitic air, either leparately, or varioufly combined.
T h e errors which fo often defeat the intention o f drinking the purgative mineral
waters, and which fo frequently prove injurious to the patient, proceed from the
manner o f ufing them, the quantity taken, the regimen purfued, or uling them in
cafes where they are not proper. D rinking the water in too great quantity, not only
injures the bowels and occafions indigeftion, but generally deteats the intention tor
which it is taken. T h e difeafes for the cure o f which mineral waters are chiefly
celebrated, are moftly o f the chronic k in d ; and it is well known that fuch difeafes
can only be cured by the flow operation o f alteratives, o r fuch medicines as a d by
inducing a gradual change in the habit. T h is requires length o f time, and never
can be effeded by medicines which run o ff by ftool, and operate chiefly on the firft
paffages, Thofe who wifh for the cure o f any obftinate malady from the mineral
waters, ought to take them in fuch a manner as hardly to produce any effed what­
ever on the bowels. W ith this view a half-pint glafs m ay be drtmk at bed-time,
and the fame quantity an hour before breakfaft, dinner, and fupper. T h e dofe,
however, muft vary according to circumftances. Even the quantity mentioned
above will purge fome perfons, while others will drink twice as much without being
in the leaft moved by it. Its operation on the bowels is the only ftandard for ufing
the water as an alterative. N o more ought to be taken than barely to move the
b o d y; nor is it always neceffary to carry it this length, provided the water goes o ff
39- 3 & by
202
by the other em unftories, and does not occafion a chilnefs, or flatulency in the fto-
mach or bowels. W hen the water is intended to purge, the quantity mentioned
above may be all taken before breakfaft. T o promote the operation o f mineral
waters, and to carry them through the fyftem, exercife is indifpenfably neceflary.
T his may be taken in any manner that is moft agreeable to the patient, but he
ought never to carry it to excefs. A s a purgative, thefe waters are chiefly recom ­
mended in difeafes o f the firft paflages, accompanied with, or proceeding from , in­
activity o f the ftomach and bowels, acidity, indigeftion, vitiated bile, worm s, putrid
fores, the piles, and jaundice. In molt cafes o f this kind, they are the belt m edi­
cines that can be adminiftered. But, when ufed with this view, it is fuflicient to
take them twice, or at m od three times, a week, fo as to move the body three or four
tim es; and it will be proper to continue this courfe for fome weeks. But the ope­
ration o f the more a& ive mineral waters is not confined to the bowels. T h ey often
promote the difcharge o f urine, and not unfrequently increafe the perfpiration.
T h is fhews that they are capable o f penetrating into every part o f the body, and o f
Sim ulating the whole fyftem. H ence arifes their efficacy in rem oving the m od
obftinate o f all diforders, obftru&ions o f the glandular and lym phatic f>ftem. U n ­
der this clafsis comprehended the fcrophula or king’s evil, indolent tum ours,obftruc-
tions o f the liver, fpleen, kidneys, and mefenteric glands. When thefe great pur-
pofes are to be effected, the waters m ud be ufed in the gradual manner mentioned
above, and perfifted in for a length o f time. It will be proper, however, now and
then to difeontinue their ufe for a few days. T h e next great clafs o f difeafes, where
mineral waters are found to be beneficial, are thofe o f the fkin, as the itch, fcab,
tetters, ring-worms, fcaly eruptions, leprofies, blotches, foul ulcers, & c. T h ou gh
thefe may feem fuperficial, yet they are often the m oft obftinate which the phyfician
has to encounter, and riot unfrequently fee his fkill at defiance: but they will fome-
tirnes yield to the application o f mineral waters for a fufficient length o f time, and
in moft cafes o f this kind thefe waters deferve a trial.

I T is peculiarly unfortunate for the unhappy perfons who contract this difeafe,
that it lies under a fort o f difgracc. T h is renders difguife neceflary, and makes the
patient either conceal his diforder altogether, or apply to thofe who promife a fud-
den and lecret cure; but who in fa& only remove the fymptoms for a time, while
they fix the difeafe deeper in the habit. By this means a flight infe&ion, which
m ight have been eafily removed, is often converted into an obftinate, and fometimes
incurable, malady. Another unfavourable circumftance attending this difeafe is,
that it affumes a variety o f different fhai>cs, and may with more propriety be called
an
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 203
an aflemblage o f difeafes, than a Angle one. N o two difeafes can require a more dif­
ferent method o f treatment than this does in its different ftages. Hence the folly and
danger o f trufting to any particular noftrum for the cure o f it. Such noftrums arc
however generally adminiftered in the fame manner to all who apply for them, with­
out the lead regard to the date o f the difeafe, the conftitntion o f the patient, the de­
gree o f infection, and a thoufand other circumftances o f the utmoft imjjortance.
T hough the venereal difeafe is generally the fruit o f unlawful embraces, yet it may
be communicated to the innocent as well as the guilty. Infants, nurfes, midwives,
and married women whofe hufbands lead diflolute lives, are often affe&edwith ir,and
frequently lofe their lives by not being aware o f their danger in due time. T h e un­
happy condition o f fuch perfons certainly requires that we fhould endeavour to point
out the fymptoms and cure o f this too common difeafe.
O p t h e V I R U L E N T G O N O R R H CE A .
T H E virulent gonorrhoea is an involuntary difeharge o f infectious matter from
the parrs o f generation in either fex. It generally makes its appearance within
eight or ten days after the infection has been received •, fometimes indeed it appears
in two or three days, and at other times not before the end o f four or five weeks.
Previous to the difeharge, the patient reels an itching with a fmall degree o f pain in
the genitals. Afterwards a thin glary matter begins to diftil from the urinary paf-
fage, which ftains the linen, and uccafions a fmall degree o f titillation, particularly
in the time o f making water *
, this, gradually increafing, arifes at length to a degree
o f heat and pain, which are chiefly perceived about the extremity o f the urinary
paflage, where a flight degree o f rednefs and inflammation begin to appear. A s the
diforder advances, the pain, heat o f urine, and running, increafe, while frefh fymp-
toms daily enfue. In men the erections become painful and involuntary, and are
more frequent and lading than when natural. T h is fymptom is moft troublefome
when the patient is warm In bed. T h e pain, which was at firft only perceived to­
wards the extremity, now begins to reach ail up the urinary paffage, and is molt
intenfe ju ft after the patient has done m aking water. T h e running gradually re­
cedes from the colour o f feed, grows yellow, and at length puts on the appearance
o f matter. W hen the diforder has arrived at its height, all the fymptoms are more
intenfe; the heat o f urine is Cogreat, that the patient dreads the m aking water, and,
though he feels a conftant inclination this way, yet it is rendered with the gveateft
difficulty, and often only b y drops : the involuntary erections now become ex­
tremely painful and frequent *
, there is alfo a pain, heat, and fenfe o f fulnefs, about
the feat, and the running is plentiful and (harp, o f a brown greeni/h, and fometimes
o f a bloody, colour.

C U R E __ W hen a perfon has reafon tQ fufp£& that he has c.aught the venereal
infection, he ought m oft ftridtly to obfcrvc a cooling regimen, to avoid every thing
o f a heating nature, as wines, fpirituous liquors, rich fauces, fpiced, faked, high-fea-
foned, and fm oke-dried, provifions, & c. as alfo all aromatic and ftimulating vegeta­
bles, as onions, garlic, lhallot, nutmeg, muftard, cinnamon, mace, ginger, and
fuch-like. H is food ought chiefly to confift o f m ild vegetables, m ilk, broths,
light puddings, panado, gruels, See. H is drink may be barley-water, m ilk and
water, deco&ions o f marfh-mallows and liquorice, linfeed-tea, or clear whey. O f
thefe he ought to drink plentifully. Violent exercife o f all kinds, efpecially riding
on horfeback, and venereal pleafures, are to be avoided.. T h e patient muft beware
o f cold, and, when the inflammation is violent, he ought to keep his bed. A viru­
lent gonorrhoea cannot always be cured fpeedily and effe&ually at the fame time.
T h e patient ought therefore not to expett, nor the phyfician to promife, it. It w ill
often continue for two or three weeks, and fometimes for five or fix, even where the
treatment has been very proper. Sometimes indeed a flight infection may be carried
oft* in a few days, by bathing the parts in warm m ilk and warer, and injecting fre­
quently up the urethra a little fweec oil or linfeed-tea about the warmth o f new
m ilk. Should thefe not fucceed in carrying o ff the infection, they will at leaft have
a tendency to leflen its virulence. T o effeft a cure, however, aftringent inje&ions
w ill generally be found neceflary. Thefe may be various ways prepared, but thofe
made with the white vitriol are both moft fafe and efficacious. T h ey can be made
ilronger or weaker as circum ftances may require, but it is beft to begin with the
more gentle, and increaie their power if neceflary. A drachm o f white vitriol may
be difiolved in eight or nine ounces o f common or rofe-water, and an ordinary
fyringe fu ll o f it thrown up three or four times a-day. I f this quantity does not
perform a cure, it may be repeated, and the dole increafed. W hether injections be
tiled or not, cooling purges are always proper in the gonorrhoea. T h e y ought not
however to be o f the ftrong or draftic kind. W hatever raifes a violent com m o­
tion in the body increafes the danger, and tends to drive the difeafe deeper into the
habit. Procuring tw o or three ftools every fecond or third day for the firft fort­
night, and the fame number every fourth or fifth day for the fecond, w ill generally
be fufficicnt to remove the inflammatory fym ptom s, to diminiih the running, and
to change the colour and confidence o f the matter, which gradually becomes more
clear and ropy as the virulence abates. W hen the inflammatory fymptoms run
high, bleeding is always neceflary at the beginning. T h is operation, as in othertopi-
cal inflammations, m uft be repeated according to the ftrength and conftitution o f the
patient, and the vehemence and urgency o f the fymptoms. Medicines which pro­
mote the fecretion o f urine are likew ife proper in this ftage o f the diforder. F or

thispurpofe an ounce o f nitre and two ounces o f gum arabic, pounded together,
may be divided into twenty-four dofes, one o f which may be taken frequently, in a
cup o f the patent's drink. I f thefe fhould make him pafs his urine fo often as to
become troublefome to him , he may either take them lefs frequently, or leave out
the nitre altogether, and takeequal parts o f gum arabic and cream o f tartar. Thefe
may be pounded together, and a tea-fpoonful taken in a cup o f the patient's drink
four or five times a day. I have generally found this anfwer extremely well both
as a diuretic, and for keeping the body gently open. W hen the pain and inflam­
mation are feated high, towards the neck o f the bladder, it will be proper frequently
to throw up an emollient clyfter, which, befides the benefit o f procuring ftools, will
ferve as a fomentation to the inflamed parts. Soft poultices, when they can conve­
niently be applied to the parts, are o f great iervice. T h ey may be made o f the flour
o f linfeed, or o f wheat-bread and m ilk, fofeened with frefli butter or fweet oil.
W hen poultices cannot be conveniently ufed, cloths wrung out o f warm water, or
bladders filled with warm m ilk and water, may be applied. Few things tend more
to keep o ff inflammation in the fpermatic veffels than a proper trufs for the ferotum.
It ought to be fo contrived as to fupport the tefticles, and fhould be worn from the
firft appearance o f the difeafe till it has ceafed fome weeks. M any people, on the
firft appearance o f a gonorrhoea, fly to the ufe o f m ercury. T h is is a bad plan.
M ercury is often not at all neceffary in a gonorrhoea*, and, when taken too early, it
does mifehief. It may be neceffary to complete the cure, but it can never be proper
at the commencement o f it. W hen bleeding, purging, fomentations, and the other
things recommended above, haveeafed the pain, foftened the pulfe, relieved the heat
o f urine, and rendered the involuntary eredions lefs frequent, the patient may begin
to ufe mercury in any form that is leaft difagrecable to him. I f he takes the com ­
mon mercurial pill, two at night and one in the morning w ill be a fufficiene dole at
firft. Should they affect the mouth too m uch, the dofe m uft be leffened j if not at
all, it may be gradually increafed to five or fix pills in the day. I f calomel be
thought preferable, two or three grains o f it, formed into a bolus with a little o f the
conferve o f hips, may be taken at bed-time, and the dole gradually increafed to
eight or ten grains. One o f the moft common preparations o f mercury now in ufe
is the corrofive fublimate. T h is may be taken in the manner hereafter recommend­
ed under the confirmed lues or p o x : it is one o f the moft fafe and efficacious medi­
cines when properly ufed. T h e above medicines may either be taken every day or
every other day, as the patient is able to bear them. T h ey ought never to be taken
in fuch quantity as to raife a falivation, unlefs in a very flight degree. T h e difeafe
may be more fafely, and as certainly, cured without a falivation as with it. W hen
the mercury runs o ff by the m outh, it is not fo fuccefsful tn carrying o ff the difeafe,
39* 3 G as
as when it continues longer in the body, and is difcharged gradually. Should the
patient be purged or griped in the night by the m ercury, nem uft take an infufxonof
fenna, or fome other purgative, and drink freely o f water-gruel to prevent bloody
flools, which are very apt to happen fhould the patient catch cold, or if the m ercury
has not been duly prepared. W hen the bowels are w eak, and the mercury is apt
to gripe or purge, thefe difagreeable confequences may be prevented by taking,
with the above pills or bolus, half a drachm or two fcruples o f diafeordium, or o f
the Japonic confeftion. T o prevent the difagreeable circum flanceof the m ercury's
aHefting the mouth too m uch, or bringing on a falivation, it may be combined with
purgatives. W ith this view the laxative mercurial pill has been contrived, the
ufual dole o f which is h alf a drachm, or three pills, night and morning, to be re­
peated every other d a y; but the fafer way is for the patient to begin with two, or
even with one, pill, gradually increafing the dofe. T o fuch perfons as can neither
fwallow a bolus nor a pill, mercury may be given in a liquid form , as it can be fuf-
pended even in a watery vehicle, by means o f gum -arabic ♦, which not only ferves
this purpofe, but likewife prevents the mercury from affefting the m outh, and ren­
ders it in many refpefts a better medicine. T a k eq u ick filv e r one drachm ; gum -ara­
bic reduced to a m ucilage, in a marble mortar, until the globules o f m ercury
entirely difappear: afterwards add gradually, Hill continuing the trituration, h alf
an ounce o f balfamic fyrup, and eight ounces o f iim ple cinnamon-water. T w o
table-fpoonfuls o f this folution may be taken night and morning. It happens very
fortunately for thofe who cannot be brought to take m ercury inwardly, and likewife
for perfons whofe bowels are too tender to bear it, that an external application o f it
anfwers equally well, and, in fome refpefts, better. It m ull be acknowledged, thac
m ercury, taken inwardly for any length o f time, greatly weakens and diforders the
bow els; for which reafon, when a plentiful ufe o f it becomes necefiary, we would
prefer rubbing to the mercurial pills. T h e common mercurial or blue ointment,
w ill anfwer very well. O f that which is made by rubbing together equal quanti­
ties o f hog’s-lard and quickfilver, about a drachm may be ufed at a time. T h e
belt time for rubbing ic on is at night, and the m olt proper place the inner-fide o f
the thighs. T h e patient fhould ftand before the fire when he rubs, and fhould wear
flannel drawers next his fkin at the time he is ufing the ointment. I f ointment o f
a weaker or (Ironger kind be ufed, the quantity m uft be increafed or diminilhed in
proportion. If, during the ule o f the ointment, the inflammation o f the genital
parts, together with the heat and fcverifhnefs, fhould return, or, if the mouth fhould
grow fore, the gums tender, and the breath become offenfive, a dofe or two of G lau ­
ber's fahs, or fome other cooling purge, may be taken, and the rubbing intermitted
for a few days. A s foon, however, as the figns o f fpitting are gone off, if the viru-

lency be not quite corrected, the ointment m ud be repeated, but in fmaller quanti­
ties, and at longer intervals, than before. W hatever way mercury is adminiftered,
its ufe muft be perfifted in as long as any virulency is fufpe&ed to remain. W hen
the above treatment has removed the heat o f urine, and forenefs o f the genital parts -

when the quantity o f running is confiderably lcflened, without any pain or fuelling
in the groin or tefticle fuperventing-, when the patient is free from involuntary
erections; and laftly, when the running becomes pale, whitifli, thick, void o f ill
fmell, and tenacious or ro p y; when all or m od o f thefe fymptoms appear, the go­
norrhoea is arrived at its lafl: ftage, and we may gradually proceed to treat it as a
gleet with aftringent and agglutinating medicines.
O f G L E E T S ,
A G O N O R R H O E A frequently repeated, or improperly treated, often ends in a
gleet, which may either proceed from relaxation, or from fame remains o f the difeale.
It is, however, o f the greateft importance, in the cure o f the gleet, to know from
which o f thefe caufes it proceeds. W hen the difeharge proves very obftinate, and
receives little or no check from aftringent remedies, there is ground to fufpedt that
it is owing to the latter ; but, if the drain is inconftanc, and is chiefly obfervable
when the patient is ftimulated by lafeivious ideas, or upon (training to go to (tool,
we may reafonably conclude chat it is chiefly owing to the former. In the cure o f a
gleet proceeding from relaxation, the principal defign is to brace, and reftore a pro­
per degree o f tenfion to the debilitated and relaxed vefTcls. For this purpofe, be-
fides the medicines recommended in the gonorrhoea, the patient may have recourfe to
ftronger and more powerful aftringents, as the Peruvian bark, alum , vitriol, galls,
tormentil, biftore, balauftines, tincture o f gum -kino, & c . T h e injections may be
rendered more aftringent by the addition o f a few grains o f alum , or increaling the
quantity o f vitriol as far as the parts are able to bear it. T h e lalt remedy which we
ihall mention in this cafe is the cold bath, than which there is not perhaps a more
powerful bracer in the whole compafs o f medicine. It ought never to be omitted
in this fpecics o f gleet, unlcfs there be fomething in the confticution o f the patient
which renders the ufe o f it unfafe. T h e chief objections to the ufe o f the cold bath
are, a full habit, and an unfound ftate o f the vifccra. T h e danger trom the former
may always be leflened, if not rem oval, by purging and bleeding; but the latter is
an unfurmountable obftacle, as the preifure o f the water, and the hidden contraction
o f the external veflels, by throwing the blood with too m uch force u|>on the inter­
nal parts, are apt to occafion ruptures o f the veflels, or a flux o f humours upon
the difeafed organs. B ut, where no objection o f this kind prevails, the patient
ought to plunge over head in water every morning fatting, for three or four weeks
together.
together. H e fhould not, however, flay long in the water, and fhould take care to
have his fkin dried as Toon as he comes out. T h e regimen proper in this cafe is the
fame as was mentioned in the laft ftage o f the gonorrhoea : the diet m ud be drying
and aftringent, and the drink Spa, Pyrm ont, or Briftol, waters, with which a little
claret or red wine may fometimes be mixed. A n y perfon may now afford to drink
thefe waters, as they can be every where prepared at almoft no txpence, by a m ix­
ture o f common chalk and oil o f vitriol. W hen the gleet does not yield to tild e
medicines, there is reafon to fufpedfc that it proceeds from ulcers. In this cafe, re-
courfe m ud be had to m ercury, and fuch medicines as tend to correct any predomi­
nant acrimony with which the juices may be affedted, as the decodtionof china, far-
fapariila, faflafras, or the like. T h e beft remedy for the cure o f ulcers in the uri­
nary paflage, are the fuppurating candles or bougies ♦, as thefe are prepared various
ways, and are generally to be bought ready-made, it is needlcfs to fpend tim e in
enumerating the different ingredients o f which they are compofed, or teaching the
manner o f preparing them : before a bougie be introduced into the urethra, how­
ever, it fhould be fmeared all over with fweet oil, to prevent it from flim ulating too
fuddenly; it may be fuffered to continue in from one to feven or eight hours, ac­
cording as the patient can bear it. Obftinace ulcers are not only often healed, but
tumours and excrefcences in the urinary paffages taken away, and an obftrudbon o f
urine removed, by means o f bougies.
O f t h e S W E L L E D T E S T I C L E .
T H E fwelled tefticle may either proceed from infedtion lately contracted, o r from
the venereal poifon lurking in the blood: the latter indeed is not very com m on,
bu* the former frequently happens both in the firft and fecond ftages o f a g o ­
norrhoea * particularly when the running is unfeafonably checked, by cold, hard
drinking, ftrong draflic purges, violent exercife, the too early ufe o f aftringent m e­
dicines, or the like. In the inflammatory ftage bleeding is neceflary, which m uft be
repeated according to the urgency o f the fymptoms. T h e food muft be light, and
the drink diluting. High-feafoned food, flefh, wines, and every thing o f a heating
nature, are to be avoided. Fomentations are o f Angular fervice. Poultices o f
bread and m ilk, foftened with frefh butter or o il, are likewife very proper, and
ought conftantly to be applied when the patient is in bed : when he is up, the tef-
ticlc fhould be kept warm , and fupported by a bag or trufs, which may eafily be
contrived in fuch a manner as to prevent the weight o f the tefticle from having any
effedt. Jf it fhould be found impracticable to clear the tefticle by the cooling regi-
*ncn now pointed out, and extended according to circum ftances, it will be neceflary

againft any future uneafinefs. For this purpofe, befides rubbing the mercurial
ointmenton the part, if free from pain, or on the thighs, as directed in the gonorrhoea,
the patient muft be confined to bed, if neceflary, for five or fix weeks, fufpending
the tefticleall the while with a bag or trufs, and plying him inwardly with ftrong
decoctions o f farfaparilla. W hen thefe means do not fucceed, and there is reafon to
fufpeft a fcrophulous or cancerous habit, either o f which may fupporc a fcirrhous
induration, after the venereal poilon is corre&ed, the parts fhould be iomented daily
with a deco&ion o f hem lock, the bruifed leaves o f which may likewife be added to
the poultice, and the extract at the fame time taken inwardly. By this method, dif-
eafed tefticles o f two or three years ftanding,even when ulcerated, and affe&ed with
pricking and lancing pains, have been completely cured.

V E N E R E A L buboes are hard tumours feated in the groin, occafioned by the
venereal poifon lodged in this part. They are o f two k in d s; viz. fuch as proceed
from a recent infection, and fuch as accompany a confirmed lues. T h e cure o f re­
cent buboes, that is, fuch as appear foon after impure coition, may be firft attempted
by difperfion, and, if that fhould not fucceed, by fuppuration* T o promote the
difperfion o f a buboe, the fame regimen muft beobferved as was directed in the firlt
ftage o f a gonorrhoea. T h e patient muft likewife be bled, and take fome cooling
purges, as the decoction o f tamarinds and'lenna, G lau bers falts, and the like.
by this courfe, the fwelling and other inflammatory fymptoms abate, we may fafely
proceed to the ufe o f mercury, which m uft be continued till the venereal virus is
quite fubdued. B ut, if the buboe fhould, from the beginning, be attended with
great heat, pain, and pulfation, it will be proper to promote its fuppuration. For
this purpofe the patient m ay be allowed to ufe his ordinary diet, and to take now
and then a glafs o f wine. Em ollient cataplafms, confifting o f bread and milk
foftened with oil or frefh butter, may be applied to the p a rt; and, in cold confticu-
tions, where the tumour advances (lowly, white-lily-roots boiled, or fliced onions
raw, and a fufficient quantity o f yellow bafilicon, may be added to the poultice.
W hen the tumour is ripe, which may be known by its conical figure, the fofenefs
o f the (kin, aud a fluttuation o f matter plainly to be felt under the finger, it may
be opened either by cauftic or a lancet, and afterwards drefTed with digeftive oint­
ment. It fometimes, however, happens that buboes can neither be dilperfed not
brought to a fuppuration, but remain hard indolent tumours. In this cafe the in­
durated glands muft be confumed by cauftic j if they fhould become fcirrhous, they
muft bediffolved by the application o f hem lock, both externally and internally, as
directed in the fcirrhous tefticle.

O f C H A N C R E S .
C H A N C R E S are foperfidal, callous,eating, ulcers; which may happen either
with or without a gonorrhoea. T h ey are com m only fcated about the glans, and
make their appearance in the follow ing m anner: firft a little red pim ple arifes,
which loon becomes pointed at top, and is filled with a whitifh matter inclining to
yellow. T h is pimple is hot, and itches generally before it breaks : afterwards it
degenerates into an obftinate ulcer, the bottom o f which is ufually covered w ith a
vil'cid mucus, and whofeedges gradually become hard and callous. Sometimes the
firft appearance refembles a fimple excoriation o f the cuticle-, which, however, if
the caufe be venereal, foon becomes a true chancre. A chancre is fometimes a
pri mary affection, but it is much oftener fymptomatic, and is the m ark o f a con*
firmed lues. Primary cancres difcover themfelves foon after impure coition, and
are generally feated in parts covered with a thin cuticle, as the lips, the nipples o f
women, the glanspen:sof men, & c . W hen venereal ulcers are feated in the lips, the
infection may be communicated by killing. W hen a chancre appears foon after
impure coition, its treatment is nearly fim ilar to that o f the virulent gonorrhoea.
T h e patient muft obferve the cooling regimen, lofe a little blood, and take fom e
gentle dofes o f falts and manna. T h e parts affeded ought frequently to be bathed,
or rather foaked, in warm m ilk and water, and, if the inflammation be great, an
emollient poultice or cataplafm may be applied to them . T h is courfe w ill, in m oil
cafes, be fufficient to abate the inflammation, and prepare the patient for the ufe o f
mercury. Symptom atic chancres are com m only accompanied with ulcers in the
throat, notturnal pains, fcurfy eruptions about the roots o f the hair, and other fym p-
toms o f a confirmed lues. T h ou gh they may be feated in any o f the parts mentioned
above, they commonly appear upon the private parts, or the infide o f the thigh.
T h ey are alfo lefs painful, but frequently m uch larger and harder, than primary
chancres. Thisdiforder is ufually attended withaftranguary orobftru&ion o f urine,
a phymofis, & c . A ftranguary may be occafionedeitherbyafpafm odic conftriftion,
or an inflammation o f the urethra and parts about the neck o f the bladder. In the
former cafe, the patient begins to void his urine w ith tolerable eafe; but, as foon as
it touches the galled or inflamed urethra, a hidden conftriftion take place, and the
urine is avoided by fpirts, and lometimes by drops only. W hen the ftranguary is
owing to an inflammation about the neck o f the bladder, there is aconftantheat and
unealinefs o f the part, a perpetual defire to make water, while the patient can only
render a few drops, and a troublcfome cenefmus, or conftant inclination to go to ftool.
W hen the ftranguary is owing to fpafm, fuch medicines as tend to dilute and blunt
the falts o f the urine w ill be proper. For this purpofe, befides the common diluting
liquors,
C U L P E P E R ' S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 211
liquors, foft and cooling emul lions, fweetened with the fyrup o f poppies, may be ufed.
Should thefe not have the defired effect, bleeding, and emollient fomentations, will
be neceffary. W hen the complaint i$ evidently owing to an inflammation about
the neck o f the bladder, bleeding muft Le more liberally performed, and repeated
according to the urgency o f the fymptoms. A fter bleeding, if the ftranguary ftill
continues, foft clyfters, with a proper quantity o f laudanum in them, may be ad-
miniftered, and emollient fomentations applied to the region o f the bladder. A t the
fame time, the patient may take every four hours a tea-cupful o f barley-water, to an
E nglifh pint o f which fix ounces o f the fyrup o f marfh-mallows, four ounces o f the
oil o f fweet almonds, and half an ounce o f nitre, may be added. I f thefe remedies
ihould not relieve the complaint, and a total luppreflion o f urine fliould come on,
bleeding muft be repeated, and the patient fet in a warm bath up to the middle* It
w ill be proper, in this cafe, to difeontinue the diuretics, and to draw o ff the water
with a catheter-, but, as the patient is feldom able to bear its being introduced, we
w ould rather recommend the ufe o f mild bougies. Thefe often lubricate the paf-
fage, and greatly facilitate the difeharge o f urine. W henever they begin to ftimu-
late or give any uneafinefs, they may be withdrawn. T h e phymofls is fuch a con-
ftridlion o f the prepuce over the glans as hinders it from being drawn backwards;
the paraphymofis, on the contrary, is fuch a conftri&ion o f the prepuce behind the
glans as hinders it from being brought forwards. T h e treatment o f thefe fymptoms
is fo nearly the fame with that o f the virulent gonorrhoea, that we have no occafion
to enlarge upon it. In genera), bleeding, purging, poultices, and emollient fomen­
tations, are fufficient. Should thele, however, fail o f removing the ftricture, and
the parts be threatened with a mortification, twenty or thirty grains o f ipecacuanha,
and one grain o f emetic tartar, may be given for a vom it, and may be worked o ff
with warm water or thin gruel. It fometimes happens, that, in fpite o f all endea­
vours to the contrary, the inflammation goes on, and fymptoms o f a beginning
mortification appear. W hen this is the cafe, the prepuce m uft be fcarified with a
lancet, and, if neceffary, divided, in order to prevent a ftrangulation, and fet the
imprifoned glans at liberty. W e (hall not deferibe the manner o f performing this
operation, as it ought always to be done by a furgeon. W hen a mortification has
actually taken place, it will be neceffary, befides performing the above operations,
to foment the parts frequently with cloths wrung out of a ftrong decoction o f camo­
mile flowers and bark, and to give the patient a drachm o f the bark in powder every
tw o or three hours. W ith regard to the priapifm, chordee, and other diftortions o f
t\tp m s>their treatment is no way different from that o f the gonorrhoea. W hen
they prove very troublefome, the patient may take a few drops o f laudanum at
night, efpecially after the operation o f a purgative through the day.

O f a C O N F I R M E D L U E S .
T H E fymptoms o f a confirmed lues are, buboes in the groin, pains o f the head
and joints, which are peculiarly troublefome in the night, or when the patient is
warm in bed; fcabs and feurfs in various parts o f the body, efpecially on the head,
o f a yellowifh colour, refembling a honey-com b; corroding ulcers in various parts
o f the body, which generally begin about the throat, from whence they creep gra­
dually, by the palate, towards the cartilage o f the nofe, which they deftroy ; excres­
cences or exoltofes arife in the middle o f the bones, and their fpongy ends become
brittle, and break upon the lead accident; at other times, they are foft, and bend
like w ax; the conglobate glands become hard and callous, and form, in the neck,
armpits, groin, and menfentery, hard moveable tumours, like the king’s e v il; tu­
mours o f different kinds are likewife formed in the lymphatic veffels, tendons,
ligaments, and nerves, as the gummata, ganglia, nodes, tophs, & c . the eyes are
affc&ed with itching, pain, rednefs, and fometimes with total blindnefs, and the
ears with a finging noife, pain, and deafnefs, whiift their interna) fubftance is exul-
cerated and rendered carious; at length all the anim al, vital, and natural, func­
tions, are depraved; the face becomes pale and liv id ; the body emaciated and
unfit'for motion, and the miferable patient falls into an atrophy or w ading confump-
tfon. W om en have fymptoms peculiar to the fex; as cancers o f the bread, a fup-
preffion or overflow ing o f the menfes, the whites, hyderic aflfe&ions, an inflamma­
tion, abfeefs, feirrhus, gangrene, cancer, or ulcer, o f the w om b ; they are generally
either barren or fubjeft to abortion; or, if they bring children into the world,
they have an univerfal eryfipelas, are half rotten, and covered with ulcers. Such is
the catalogue o f fymptoms attending this dreadful difeafe in its confirmed date.
Indeed they are feldom to be met with in the fame perlon, or at the fame tim e; fo
many o f them, however, are generally prefent as are fufficient to alarm the patient;
and, if he has reafon to fufpelt the infe&ion is lurking in his body, he ought im­
mediately to fet about the expulfion o f it, otherwife the m od tragical confequences
w ill enfue. T h e only certain remedy hitherto known in Europe, for the cure o f
this difeafe, is mercury, which may be ufed in a great variety o f forms, with nearly
the fame fuccefs. Some time ago it was reckoned impoflible to cure a confirmed
lues without a falivation ; this method is now, however, pretty generally laid afide,
and mercury is found to be as efficacious, or rather more fo, in expelling the vene­
real poifon, when adminidered in fuch a manner as not to run o ff by the falivary
glands. T h e only chemical preparation o f mercury which we fhall take notice o f
is the corrofive fublitnate. T h is was fome time ago brought into ufe for the vene­
real difeafe in Germ any, by the illudrious Baron V an Sw ieten; and was foon after
i introduced
ate C U L P E P E R ' S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y . 213
introduced into Britain by the learned Sir John Pringle, at that time ph> fician to the
army. T h e method o f giving it i$ as follow s: one grain o f corrofive fublimate i;
diflolved in two ounces o f French brandy or rnalt fpirits; and o f this folution, an
ordinary cable-fpoonful, or the quantity o f half an ounce, is to be taken twice a-
day, and to be continued as long as any fymptoms o f the diforder remain. T o tiiofe
whole ftomach cannot bear the folution, the fublimate may be given in form o f pills.
Several roots, woods, and barks, have been recommended for curing the venereal
difeafe; but, though none o f them, when adminiftered alone, have been found,
upon experience, to anfwer the high encomiums which have been bellowed
upon them, yet, when joined with mercury, many o f them are found to be
very beneficial in promoting a cure. T he bed we know yet is farfaparilla,
and the mezereon-root, which are powerful afliftants to the lilblinute, or to any
other mercurial. Thofe who chufe to ufe the mezereon by icfclf, may boil an ounce
o f the frefh bark, taken from the root, in twelve Englifh pints o f water to eight,
adding towards the end an ounce of liquorice. T h e dole o f this is the fame as o f
the decoction o f farfaparilla. W e have been told that the natives o f Am erica cure
the venereal difeafe, in every ftage, by a deco&ion o f the root o f a plant called the
Lobelia. It is ufed either frefh or dried ; but we have no certain accounts with re­
gard to the proportion. Sometimes they mix other roots with it, as thofe o f the
ranunculus, the ceanothus, See. but whether thefe are dcfigned to difguife or affid
it, is doubtful. T h e patient takes a large draught o f the decoition early in the
morning, and continues to ufe it for his ordinary drink through the day. M any
other roots and woods are highly extolled for curing the venereal difeafe, as the roots
o f foap-wort, burdock, & c. as alfo the wood o f guaiacum and faflafras *
, but, being
particularly pointed out in the H erbal, we fhall, for the fake o f brevity, pafs them
over in this place, with only remarking, that, though we are (till very much in the
dark with regard to the method o f curing this difeafe among the natives o f Am erica,
yet it is well known, that they do cure it with fpeed, fafety, and fuccefs, by the ufe
o f vegetables only, and that without the lead knowledge o f mercury. Hence it
becomes an object o f confiderable importance to difeover a method o f cure in this
iiland, by the ufe o f vegetables only, by making trfals o f all the various plants
which are found in it, and particularly fuch as Culpeper was known to make

bal. Indeed there can be no doubt, but plants o f our own growth, were proper
pains taken to difeover them, would be found as efficacious in curing the venereal
difeafe here, as thofe o f Am erica there; for it m ull be remembered, that what will
cure a patient o f the venereal difeafe in one country will not have equal fuccefs if
carried into another; a plain demonflration that every country produces that which
is mod congenial to the health o f its own native inhabitants.

M ercury ought not to be adminiftered to women in the menftrual flux, or when
the period is near at hand. Neither fliould it be given in the laft ftage o f pregnancy.
]f, however, the woman be not near the time o f her delivery, and circumftances ren­
der it neceflary, mercury may be given, but in fnialler doles, and at greater intervals
than u fu al: with thefe precautions, both the mother and child may be cured at the
fame tim e; if not, the diforder will at lealt be kept from growing worfe, till the
woman be brought to bed, and fufflcicntly recovered, when a more effectual me­
thod may be purfued, which, if flhe fuckles her child, will, in all probability, be
fufHcient for the cure o f both. M ercury ought always to be adminiftered to infants
with the greateft caution. T h eir tender condition unfits them for fupporting a fa-
livation, and makes it neceflary to adminifter even the mildeft preparations o f mer­
cury to them with a fparing hand. A fimilar condu& is recommended in the treat­
ment o f old perfons, who have the misfortune to labour under a confirmed lues.
N o doubt the infirmities o f age muft render people lefs able to undergo the fatigues
o f a falivation ; but this, as was formerly obferved, is never neceflary; befides, we
have generally found, that mercury had much lefs effeft upon very old perfons than
on thofe who were younger. T h e moft proper feafons for entering upon a courfe o f
mercury, are the fpring and autumn, when the air is o f a moderate w arm th; if the
circumftances o f the calc, however, will not admit o f delay, we muft not defer the
cure on account o f the feafon, but muft adminifter the mercury ; taking care, at
the fame time, to keep the patient’s chamber warmer or cooler, according as the
feafon o f the year requires. A proper regimen muft be obferved by fuch as are under
a courfe o f mercury. Inattention to this not only endangers the patient’s life, but
often alfo difappoints him o f a cure. A much fmaller quantity o f mercury will be
fuflicicnt for the cure o f a perfon who lives low, keeps warm, and avoids all manner
o f excels, than o f one who cannot endure to put the fmalleft reftraint upon his ap­
petites : indeed it but rarely happens that fuch are thoroughly cured. There is
hardly any thing o f more importance, either for preventing or rem oving venereal
infection, than cleanlinefs. By an early attention to this, the infection m ight often
be prevented from entering the b o d y; and, where it has already taken place, its
effects may be greatly mitigated. T h e moment any perfon has reafon to fufpeft
that he has received the infection, he ought to waih the parts with water and fpirits,
fweet oil, or m ilk and w ater; a finall quantity o f the laft may likcwife be injefted
up the urethra, if it can be conveniently done. L e t him pay a ftrid regard to clean­
linefs, abftain from fpirituous liquors, and pcrfcverc in a few bcttles o f the Solar
T in ltu rc, which w ill eficflually preferve the bleed from infeftion, or expel the
podon, it it has taken place, and will ix:rform a radical and perfect cure in lefs than
a month.

IN all civilized nations, women have the management o f domeftic affairs; and it
is very proper they fliould, as nature has made them lefs fit for the more active and
laborious employments. T h is indulgence, however, is often carried too fa r ; and
females, in(lead o f being benefited by it, are greatly injured, from the want o f exer-
cife and free air. T o be facisfied o f this, one need only compare the frefh and ruddy
looks o f a milk-maid with the pale complexion o f thole females whole whole time
is fpenc within doors. T hough nature has made an evident diftinltion between the
male and female with regard to bodily ftrength and vigour, yet Ihe certainly never
meant, either that the one fliould be always without, or die other always within,
doors. T h e confinement o f females, befides hurting their figure and complexion,
relaxes their folids, weakens their minds, and diforders all the functions if the
body. Hence proceed obftrultions, indigeftion, flatulence, abortions, and the whole
train o f nervous diforders. Thefe not only unfit women for being mothers and
nurfes, but often render them whimfical and ridiculous. A found mind depends fo
m uch upon a healthy body, thar, where the latter is wanting, the former is rarely to
b e found. W om en who are chiefly employed without doors, in the different
branches o f hufbandry, gardening, and the like, are almoft as hardy as their huf-
bands, and their children are likewife ftrong and healthy. B ut, as the bad effects o f
confinement and inactivity upon both faxes have been already (hewn, we fhall pro­
ceed to point out thofe circumftances in the ftrulture and defign o f females, which
fubject them to peculiar difeafes; the chief o f which are, their monthly evacua­
tions, pregnancy, child-bearing, & c.

A b o u t the firft appearance o f this difeharge, the cooftieution undergoes a very con-
fiderable change, generally indeed for the bectcr, though fomecitnes for the worfe.
T h e greateft care is therefore necefiary, as the future health and happinefs o f the
female depends, in a great meafure, upon her conduit at this period. It is the duty
o f mothers, and thofe who are intruded with the education o f girls, to inftrult them
early in the conduit and management o f theinfelves at this critical period ot their

this time, are the fourccs o f many difeafes and misfortunes in life, which a few fen-
Able leflbns from and experit need matron m ight have prevented. N or is care lefs
neceflary in the fubfequent returns o f this discharge. T a k in g improper food, vio*
lent affc&ions o f the m ind, or catching cold at this period, is often fuflicient to ruin
the health, or to render the female ever after incapable of.procreation. I f a girl
about this time o f life be confined to the houfe, kept conftantly fitting, and neither
allowed to romp about, nor employed in any active bufinefs, which gives exercife
to the whole body, (he becomes w eak, relaxed, and puny her blood not being duly
prepared, Ihe looks pale and wan her health, fpirits, and vigour, decline, and (he
finks into a valetudinary for life. Such is the fate o f numbers o f thole unhappy
iemales, who, either from too much indulgence, or their own narrow circumftances,
are, at this'critical period, denied the benefit o f exercife and free air. A lazy indo­
lent difpofition proves likewife very hurtful to girls at this period, One feldom
meets with complaints from obftru&ions amongft the more active and induftrious
part o f the fex* whereas the indolent and lazy are feldom free from them. T hefe
are, in a manner, eat up by the cblerqfis, orgreen-ficknefs, and other difeafes o f this
nature. W e would therefore recommend it to all who wifli to efcape thefe calami­
ties, to avoid indolence and inactivity, as their greateft enemies, and to be as much
abroad in the open air as poflible. A fter the menfes have once begun to flow, the
greateft care fliould be taken to avoid every thing that may tend to obftruCt them.
Cold is extremely hurtful at this particular period. M ore o f the fex date their dis­
orders from colds, caught while they are out o f order, than from all other caufes.
T h is ought furely to put them upon their guard, and to make them very circum -
fpeCt in their conduct at fuch times. A degree o f cold that will not in the leaft hurt
them at another tim e, w ill, at this period, be fufficitnt to ruin their health and con-
ftitution j therefore, from whatever caufe this flux is obftruCted, except in the Rate
o f pregnancy, proper means fhould be immediately ufed to reftore it. B ut the
menftrual flux may be too great as well as too fmall. W hen this happens, the pa­
tient becomes weak, the colour pale, the appetite and digeftion are bad, and cedema-
tous fwclllngs o f the feet, dropfies, and confumptions, often enfue. T o reftrain the
flux, the patient fhould be kept quiet and eafy both in body and m ind. I f it be
very violent, (he ought to lie in bed with her head low j to live upon a cool and
(lenderdiet, as veal or chicken-broths with bread-, and to drink decoftions o f net­
tle-roots, or the greater comfrey. I f thefe be not fuflicient to flop the flux, ftronger
aftringents may be ufed, as Japan earth, allum , elixir o f vitriol, the Peruvian bark,
& c. T w o drachms o f allum and one o f Japan earth may be pounded together, and
divided intoeight or nine dofes, one o f which may be taken three times a-day. Per-
fons whofe ftomachs cannot bear the allum , may take two table-fpoonfuls o f the
tinfture o f rofes three or four times a-day, to each dofe o f which ten drops o f lauda-

nuni may be added. I f thefe fhould fail, half a drachm o f the Peruvian bark, in
powder, with ten drops o f the elixir o f vitriol, may be taken in a glafs o f red wine
four times a-day. T h at period o f life at which the menfes ceafe to flow is likewife
very critical to the fex. T h e ftoppage o f any cuftomary evacuation, however fmall,
is fufficient to diforder the whole frame, and often to dedroy life itfclf. Hence it
comes to pafs, that fo many women either fall into chronic diforders, or die, about
this time. Such o f them, however, as will perfevere in taking the Lunar Tincture
previous to the time their menfes leave them, will become more healthy and hardy
than they were before, and enjoy ftrength and vigour to a very great age.
O f t h i G R E E N - S I C K N E S S .
T H E green-ficknefs is an obftru&ion in the womb-vefifels o f young females,
under or about the time o f their courfes beginning to flow. It is attended with a
vifeidity o f all the juices, a fallow, pale, or greenifh, colour o f the face, a difficulty
o f breathing, a ficknefs in the ftomach at the fight o f proper food, and an unnatural
defire o f feeding on fuch things as are accounted hurtful, and unfit for nourifhment.
It is alfo called by phyficians the white fever, the love fever, the virgin’s difeaic, and
the white jaundice. It fometimes feems to proceed from an alteration o f the fluids,
about the time that the menfes firft begin to flow, or from the inaptitude o f the vcf-
fels to perform thofe difeharges which nature then calls for. It may alfo proceed
from an obftru&ion in the bowels, or a fluggifh languid motion o f the blood, whe­
ther natural, or acquired by eafe, indulgence, or want o f exercifc: and this latter,
no doubt, is the cafe, when the diftemper happens to very young girls, who are not
capable o f fuffermg an hyfteric diforder. Finally, it may proceed from a longing
defire after the enjoyment o f fome particular perfon; or, in general, from a violent
inclination to exchange a Angle life for the ftate o f m atrim ony; and, when this is
the cafe, there is an univerfal dulnefs and difinclination to exercife, and the patient
complains o f a preflure or weight, chiefly about the reins and loins. Upon any
brifk motion comes on a difficulty o f breathing, and a tenfion and quick pulfation
o f the arteries in the temples, which feem to beat with great violence; alfo a heavy,
and frequently a lading, pain o f the head, and palpitation o f the heart. T h e pulfe
is quick and low, attended with a fmall feverifhnefs, and a lofs o f the natural appe­
tite •, but chalk, coals, (tones, clay, tobacco-pipes, and other things o f like unwhole-
fome nature, ought to be kept as much as pofiible out o f the patient’s w ay; for (he
generally has more inclination to thefe than to a proper diet. T h e green-ficknefs is
feldom dangerous, though it often proves o f long continuance; but when very vio­
lent, and too much neglected, proceeding from a fuppreflion o f the monthly courfes,
and attended with the whites, it may in time bring on wcaknefles, hard lwellings,
40. 3 K and
and barrennefs. W hen it happens fome time before the menfes ought to appear,
and they break forth without obftruftion, it is ufually cured upon this eruption,
without farther means. I f the whites come after the green-ficknefs has been long
fixed, it is held to be a bad fign *
, if before, and it happens upon the ftoppage o f
the menftrual flux, it often proves critical: if the courfes flow regularly during the
diftemper, it is accounted a good fymptom, and there is no danger. T o forward a
cure, the patient ought to be placed in a thin and dear air, to drink tea, barley-
water, and other attenuating liquors, warm, and made agreeable to the palate. H er
food fhould be nourifhing, but eafy o f digeftion, and not fuch as may inflame.
M oderate exercife every day, fuch as walking, riding, ftirring about the houfc, is
very ferviceable, notwithftanding the difficulty and uneafinefs that attend it, and
the great antipathy o f the patient to any fort o f motion. Sleep ought to be mode­
rate, and taken at a due diftance from meals, not till an hour or two, at leaft, after
{upper. A ll paffions o f the mind, efpecially thofe o f melancholy and defpair, are
highly prejudicial; if the difeafe, therefore, be found to proceed from a fettled in­
clination after marriage, the parents o f the patient fiiould endeavour to provide her
a fuitable match, as the moft effectual cure*, or, i f the defire be after a particular
perfon, to let her have him at all events, if they approve her choice. B ut, if matri­
mony be not judged convenient for her, either on account o f youth, or for any other
reafon, they muft then have recourie to phyfical remedies, according to the following
direflions. I f the patient be at all plethoric, that is, if her veins be well ftored with
blood, bleeding w ill be highly proper to begin the cure •, and this is to be fucceeded
by proper purgatives. In fome cafes, efpecially when the patient is very young, a
vom it is often fuccefsful, being exhibited before purgation. T hofe cathartics, that
are either mixed along with alterative medicines, or given in fuch quantities as to
make them aft as alterants, or lie a confiderable time in the body before they ope­
rate, are ufually very efficacious, and in weakly conftitutions preferable to other pur­
gatives. T h e following w ill, in general, be found to perform a cure:— 'Takecaftor,
faffron, myrrh, black hellebore-root, all in powder, each one drachm ; gum ammo­
niac, one drachm and n h alf; fait o f Heel, four fcruples; beft aloes powdered, tw o
drachms *
, oil o f cinnamon, fifteen drops; fyrup o f the five roots, a fuflicienc quan­
tity. M ake ten pills out o f every drachm, o f which let five be taken every night,
drinking after them briony-wacer, and penny-royal water, o f each two ounces.
Thefe are excellent to warm and com fort the nerves, thin the blood and juices, and
caufe them to circulate freely. T h ey muft be continued regularly for ten or
t welve days. A nd indeed all cathartics o f this nature, that are intended to make an
alteration in the whole animal f>ftem, which is often necefiary in thefe cafes, muft
have much more time to operate than thofe which are intended only to purge the
i inteftines.

inteftines. W hen the green-ficknefs proves obftinate, it is proper to have recourfe
to the cold-bath, and to the ufe o f mineral waters: or, an infufion may be made in
lime-water, with chips o f guaiacum , fafiafras, faundcrs, a little gentian and ange­
lica-root, winter-bark, and Roman worm wood; to which add tin&ure o f fteel, a
fufficient quantity in proportion to the other ingredients*, or infufe filings o f fteel
with the woods and roots. T h is may be drunk inftead o f the chalybeat-waters,
and will frequently anfwer the fame purpofe. Deco&ions or other preparations o f
the Jefuits bark, with fteel wine, and tinctures o f black hellebore and cinnamon,
being continued a confidered time, are alfo very effe&ual in lax conftitucions, and
where the juices are vifeid *
, but, when the green-ficknefs is attended with the whites,
nothing is fo certain a cure as the Lunar Tinfture. #

T H I S difeafe m3y be caufed by falls, fprains in the back, purging to excefs, ef-
pecially with mercurials, and when the body is weak and lax * or it may be the
effects o f a venereal infe&ion, which, though cured, leaves the glands and other
veftels in a relaxed ftate, which is very difficult to repair. T h e whites come away
fometimes in a large and fometimes in a fmall quantity *
, and it is obiervable, that
the running generally increafes after violent exercife, and that it is in greateft plenty
at about the middle o f the time between the monthly periods: the matter often
proves variable, being fometimes white mixed with yellow, and at others o f a thin
wacerifh confiftence, greenifh, and inclining to black ; (harp, corrofive, o f an ill
fm ell, occafioning heat o f urine, and now and then ulcers. It then caofes great
weaknefs, efpccially in the fmall o f the back and the loins*, a pale colour in the face,
faintnefs, loathing o f food, indigeftion, fwelling o f the legs, irregularity in the
courfes. Sometimes it degenerates into a confumption, or dropfy, and proves mor­
tal: at others, it caufes incurable barrennefs. T h e urine, under this dilorder, is
generally vifeid, thick, and flimy, and fometimes appears as if fmall threads were
mixed with it: nor does it fettle fo freely as in other calcs. It has ufually been
thought difficult to diftinguifh the whites from the venereal difeafe; and fume
women, who have had bad hufbands, have laboured under the latter for a long time
together, imagining it all the while to be only the form er: others have miftaken a
running, occafioned by an ulcer in the womb, for that difeafe. N o.v, as it is highly
neceflary every woman Ihould learn the fymptoms by which chele are known afun-
der, let it be obferved, that, whenever the courfes come down, the whites always
ceafe, and do not trouble the patient again till the courfes arc over; whereas a ve­
nereal running remains conftantly upon the paticnr, appears and daes not ceafe
during the monthly difeharges: it is alfo much lefs in quantity than the whites. A s
to
220
to an ulcer in the w om b, it is belt known by the fharp and growing pains that it oc-
caflons in the wom b, from the very beginning o f the difeafe; whereas in the whites,
though fomctimes the humour be fo (harp as to caufe great pain, and even an ulcer,
yet this is not till after they have continued long enough on the patient to be
diftinguifhe \ by their other fymptoms. T h e matter that flows from an ulcer is alfo
frequently bloody, which the whites never are. M aids o f a weakly conftitution are
often afflicted with this diftemper, as well as married women and widows * and in­
deed there arefew o f the fair fex, efpecially fuch as are any way fickly, but who have
known it more or lefs, it being often occafioned b y other dileafes. For whatever
difeafe renders the blood poor, foul, or vifeous, and reduces a woman to a languid
condition, is com m only fucceeded by the whites, which, when they com e in this
manner, continue to weaken the body more and more, and are in great danger,
without fpeedy remedy, o f wearing away the patient, and m aking her a miferable
victim to death. L e t no woman, therefore, negleft this diftemper, when lhe finds
it on her, but endeavour to prevent its getting too much a-head. T h e diet, in the
■ cure o f this diftemper, ought to be nourifliing, and much the fame with that pre-
feribed in confumptions, confiding o f broths, boiled with fhavings o f hartfliorn,
lorm entile-root, biftort, com frey, conferve o f red roles, ifinglafs, red rofc flowers,
gum -arabic, nutm egs, mace, cinnamon, and other ftrengthening and agglutinating
ingredients. Sago and jellies are alfo ferviceable in this cafe, particularly that o f
hartfliorn. Some drink every morning, with very good fuccefs, a quarter o f an
ounce o f ifinglafs, diflolved in a pint o f m ilk, and fweetened with fugar. E xer-
cife fhould be moderate, and taken, as much as can be, in a warm and dry a ir ; and
the continuance o f this for fome time, with a m ilk diet, have been found prevalent,
when other means, though the beft that could be made ufe of, have failed. Bleed­
ing ought here to be om itted, unlefs the perfon be plethoric, or her monthly courfes
are obftru& ed: for it is not proj^er to weaken her who is already too weak. P u r­
gatives, however, are held to be proper, but without calomel, efpecially when the
difeafe is in its infancy, and appears but in fmall quantity. But, when it is o f long
ftanding, and the matter which flows is thin, difcoloured, and o f an ill fmell i if
ulcers are apprehended in the uterus \ if any venereal infe&ion has preceded, and
part o f the virulence is ftill fuppofed to remain, mercurials and other m edicines
fuited to virulent cafes are undeniably proper: and the cure here differs little from
the cure o f the venereal dileafe itfelf, only the purges fhould not be too violent, nor
the calomel given in too large dofes. In fuch cafes, however, a perfeverance in the
Solar and Lunar Tinctures alternately, as preferibed in the Treatifes round each
bottle, may be depended on as the moft eafy, fafe, fpeedy, and elegant, cure.

T H E R E are foine diforders contracted by the fair fax, thecaufe a i c u r e o f
■ which are o f fuch a nature, that for feveral reafons, chiefly though fhame, they are
likely to conceal them, and therefore may fuffer worfeconfcquences than can here be
<lefcribed. T o tell, in few words, what I mean by fuch difcafcs as are contracted,
they are all fuch as the patient, by a criminal indulgence o f her paflions, has herfelf
been inftrumental in caufing. For that many o f the fair, efpecially in their younger
years, have fuffered much from a fecret vice, by which they have endeavoured to
procure themfelvcs thofe pleafurable fenfations which G od has ordered to be the
effects o f a mutual commerce between the fexes, is a matter o f late become too noto­
rious to be doubted, and too dreadful in its consequences to be indulged in ; I mean
that abominable vice onanifm, or fecret venery. A nd certainly none o f them can
take it amifs if, for their advantage, I venture fo far to expofe this practice, as to
remove the evil confequenccs o f it ; and to prevent, as much as poflible, its continu­
ance. T h e fecret vice before-mentioned is chiefly a fau lt o f the youth o f both
fexes; and nothing is o f more importance to the prefervation o f human-kind in g e ­
neral than the endeavouring to prevent a practice that ftrikes at the very root o f
fecundity. A m ong the motives to this crime o f felf-abulc, the three following
have, I think, with a great deal ofjuftice, been atfigned as the principal. Firft, ig­
norance o f its nature and con flu en ces. A s to its nature, there is no exprefs pro­
hibition o f it; and therefore, many may unhappily be induced to imagine, when
either by ill example, their own lafeivious inclinations, or any accidental caufe, they
have been betrayed into an acquaintance with the practice o f ir, that there can be no
harm in procuring to themfelvcs that fenfation, which, in their prefent circum-
ftances, they cannot ocherwife acquire, without a nunifeft violation o f the national
laws, and the hazard of expofing thcmfclves to flum e and infamy. I f it were not
for this unfortunate miftake, we have little reafon to imagine, that perfonsotherwife
pious, and the moft obfervant o f what is fecmly in other particulars, would be guilty
c f fuch an offence, both againft religion and decency. T h e cafe o f Onan, however
whom God flew(fee Genefis, ch. xxxviii. ver. 9.) for thus wickedly defeating the
purpofes o f generation, may anfwer the end o f a precept, and wicnefs the divine de-
teftation o f this-kind o f uncleannefs. N or is this example lefs applicable to women
than it is to men, fince we fhall fliew in the following inftances that they are as ca­
pable to render themfelvcs unapr, by fimilar practices, for the buflnefs o f procre­
ation. And as to its confequences, they are no lefs fatal to this fex than to the other,
as will be abundantly fhewn in the fame inftances. T h e fecrefy with which this
crime may be committed is a fecond in ducement to it. There muft be another
party in all other afts o f uncleannefs; but in this, there i$ neither partaker
jp* 3 L nor
221
nor wirnefs. A n d this, above all other motives, feems to have been the m oft
dangerous to women in particular, who are naturally more bafhfu l than men,
and whom cuftom has precluded from m aking any advances towards a m utual
commerce with the other fex. T h ird ly, there is no fpecific punifliment to deter
from this practice; but every one, who w ill, commits it with impunity. A d u l­
tery, in many countries, is punifhed with death: and with us, it fubjeCts a man to
pecuniary fines, and inflicts eternal infamy on the woman who is known to be guilty
o f it. Even fornication, though regarded with lefs fevericy, is yet moft fcandalous
to the fair fex in particular; efpecially when they bring into the world, as the fruit o f
it, a living witnefs o f their crim e. But for felf-abufe there is no infliction, no ocher
punifliment, but felf-confciouinefs. A nd indeed, how can there beany other ? T h e
very nature o f it, which renders it fecure againft detection, would fruftrateany pro­
vision that could be made in this cafe by the legiflature. A n d , befides this fecurity
from legal animadverfion, it is fafe from the confeq.uence which Angle women m uft
fear in their commerce with men, that o f becom ing pregnant. I might add, chat
feme give into this way out o f caution. T h ey are loth to truft their fortunes and
prerogatives in the hands o f a man, and therefore w ill not m arry; and, as to un­
lawful embraces, they dare not venture on them for many reafons. But I proceed
to Ihew, that there can be no excufe for a practice, which, befides its wickednefs is
the moft prejudicial that can be to the human confutation. Its bad effects on the
body are many and great. I f praCtifed often, it relaxes and fpoilsthe retentive fa­
culty. Icoccafions the whites in women, and gleets in men. It ruins the com ­
plexion, and makes them pale, fwarthy, and hagged. It produces a long train o f
hyftcric diforders; and fometimes, by draining away the radical moifture, induces
confumptions. It brings on heats in the privities, belly, thighs, with (hootingpains
in the head, and all over the body. It fometimes brings on that fatal malady, afuror
uterinus, or, infatiable appetite to venery. B ut what it is moft liable to produce is
barrennefs, by caufing an indifference to the pleafuresof Venus, and in time, a total
inability or inaptitude to the aCt o f generation itfelf. V irgins, who indulge them-
felves over-eagerly in th isab u feo f their bodies, deflower themfelves, and deftroy the
valuable badge o f their chaftity, which it is expeCted they fhould not part with be­
fore m arriage; but w hich, when loft, can never be retrieved. W ith regard to
maids, who have hereby deprived themfelves o f thatfacred badge, the lofs o f which
before marriage, was fo leverely punifhed among the Jew s, under what apprehenfions
m uft they continually lie !— with what terrors muft: they approach the marriage-bed,
which heaven has defigned for the feat o f the higheft fenfiblc enjoym ent! when
they refieCt that their virtue, on the firft amorous encounter, is liable to fuch fuf-
picions as may never be worn off, but which may render uncomfortable the whole
life, both o f her and her otherwife affectionate hufband ! B ut, befides this difgrace,
fuppofe women have actually entered with reputation in all other rcfpeCts on the

conjugal date, how muft it grieve them, when they find the ends o f it unanfwered,
and have room to charge their inaptitude to procreation on their own fa u lt! Both
huiband and wife, perhaps, may be paflionately defirous o f ifiue*, and the good
man may think it a defeat in himfeif, that their nuptial embraces are perpetually
fruitlefs. But, where a woman can charge herfelf with fuch a courfe o f felf-abufe,
as hath fenfibly weakened and debilitated her organs o f generation, hath fhe not all
the room in the word to be for ever unhappy, in the remembrance o f her folly and
wickednefs; and to believe, with juftice, that another woman in her cafe would not
be infertile ? H ow much more tormenting muft it be, if, befides her having ren­
dered ineffectual the ufe o f the marriage-bed, (he feels in herfelf no inclination to
the enjoyment o f it, and is thereby not only infenfible, as to her own particular, but'
makes imperfeCt to her hufbund that exquifite pleafure which ought to refult from
their mutual embraces I Suppofing neither o f the aforefaid calamities to befal her,
but that fhe is capable o f bringing forth heirs to her hufband; yet, if fhe is con-
fcious o f having weakened her body, and brought on herfelf a miferable train o f
pains and infirmities, what anxiety, what remorfe, muft not a woman endure on that
account! Every guilty female, who finds in herfelf any o f the difmal fymptoms here
enumerated, will not readily forget what fenfibly affeCts her* nor will file eafily for­
give herfelf thofe unnatural Tallies, whofe fatal confequences reft heavily upon her,
and abridge her of half thofe enjoyments, which her fex, her confticution, and the
various benefits o f nature, had made her capable o f partaking. W hat I have al­
ready faid, if duly attended to, will be fufHcient to render this practice deteftable;
to deter the young, and hitherto innocent, from m aking themfclves miferable, and
to ftop the courfe o f thofe who have already advanced far in the road to deftruction.
A fudden and refolute ftand, to all old offenders, is what I would in the firft place
ferioufiy advife, as the moft eflential ftep towards reftcring to themfclves a found
conftitution, and that peace o f mind, which they cannot otherwife enjoy. There
are few cafes fo bad, but whar, if taken in any reafonable time, a due regimen, and
the ufe o f the Solar and Lunar TinCtures, may be effectual in the relief of. L et
the guilty refolve then, that they w ill do fo no more. L e t them, as much as pofli-
ble, abftain from every thought, but efpecially from every aCtion, that may raife
irregular defires. L et them , when any way tempted, reflect on the miferable condi­
tion o f many, who, in galloping confumptions, have died terrible examples to all
thofe who perfift in this vice. As the moft ufuat complaints o f thofe who have been
guilty o f this practice regard the weaknefs and infertility o f the genitals, they muft
have rccourfe to the Solar TinCture alone, which, from its warm and Sim ulating
aCtion on the mufcular f>ftem, will reanimate the parts, quicken the circulation,
invigorate the nerves, and renovate the whole body, how much foever it might be
be debilitated, relaxed, and weakened.

T H E furor uterinus is fuch a particular complication o f hyftcrical fymptoms,
from an extraordinary fulnefs or inflammation o f the vefiels o f the womb, as forms
a fort o f madnefs, wherein the patient is preternamrally difpofed, or involuntarily
excited, 3s it were, to venereal embraces. It is a diftemper not very frequent, but
which fometimes happens. T h e figns o f it are very manifeft, both by the geftures
o f the body and the tendency o f the patient’s difcourfe; which, how great foever
her natural roodefty m ay be, w ill be extravagantly lewd. T h e caufes o f this difeafe
are ufually the fame w ith thofe o f other hyftcrical diforders-, but, by falling on the
organs o f generation, are more violent in their effefts. A vigorous, healthy, and
fanguine, conftitution, high feeding, want o f exercife, or a mixed converfation, may
rfifpofe to i t : as may alfo too large a dole o f cantharides, and other provocative m e­
dicines * or indulging vehement defircs, and too great fam iliarity, but Ihort o f en­
joym ent, with the other fex. Some time before the fit, the patient often appears
lilent and forrowful, with a bafhful, down-caft, look, and an unufual flulhing all
over the face. H er pulfe is irregular, varying from high and ftrong to low and
w eak, and then with long intervals, heaving it out, as it were, with a figh. T h efe
fymptoms increafe gradually, till the fit a&ually conies on : then the patient burfts
out into a fit o f crying* when the tears are plentifully fhed, if a man comes in her
way,, fhe is apt to lay hold o f him, and treat him with indecent fondnefs. In fine,
thofe who labour under this difordcr appear to be mad by intervals, and fay and do
a thoufand things which they arc unconfcious o f when the fit is over. I f the fym p­
toms are violent, the fit frequent and o f long continuance, and efpecially if the
patient be o f a fanguine conftitution, unmarried, a id the cafe originally proceeds
from a fixed amour, it is difficult o f cure, and fometimes degenerates into a con­
tinued madnefs. B ut, i f the diftemper proceeds from an obftru&ion or fuppreffion
o f the monthly courfes, from too great a quantity o f blood, or from a too indulgent
life, ic is more eafily remedied. T h e perfon thus affii&ed fhould be removed into
a clear and open air, if fhe be not in fuch already; and, if fhe be, a change per­
haps may be o f fervice. H er diet fhould be thin and cooling, and not taken in large
quantities: her exercife, between the fits, moderate. L et her be kept, as much as
poffible, from the com pany o f m en; and efpecially, i f love be the fufpetfted caufe,
from that man whom fhe is known to regard, unlefs it be to bring them entirely to­
gether, and cure the difeafe by removing its origin. D urin g the fir, bleed direftly,
and that in a confiderable quantity, efpecially if any evacuations have been fup-
prefledj afterwards exhibit the follow ing opiate: take black-cherry water and
white
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y .
white-wine vinegar, o f each one ounce *
, camphire half a fcruple*, white fugar, two
ounces ; liquid laudanum, forty drops: m ix them well, for a lingle draught: alfo,
take (pring-water, twelve ounces ; lemon-juice and white-wine vinegar, o f each one
ounce and an half-, white fugar, a fufficient quantity to make it palatable: mix them
well, and let her ufe it for common drink. T a k e m ilk, half a pint; tinfture o f
afafoetida, two ounces; camphire, fugar o f lead, and troches o f myrrh, o f each two
drachm s: m ix them, and injelt cold into the privities, with a proper inftrumenc.
I f thefe fail o f fuccefs, repeat the opiate; and, if the fit Rill increase, let the patient
be had to the cold bath. BliReringalio has been found ferviceable in fome women.
A whey diet, together with the ule o f the cold-bath continued for a month or two,
are excellent; and during all this time, clyfters and injections may be uled between
whiles, made according to the form above, without any mixture o f more Rimulating
ingredients. W hen this difeafe degenerates into a madnefs, it muR be treated ac­
cordingly, and the belt advice fhoukl bo immediately had.; for, if it remains long
in a confirmed Rate, it will feldom admit o f a cure.

W H E N almighty G od created the world, he fo ordered and difpofed o f the ma-
teries mundi, that every thing produced from it fhould continue fo long as the world
fhould Rand. N ot that the fame individual fpecies Ihould always remain; for they
were in procefs o f time to perifh, decay, and return to the earth from whence they
cam e; but that every like fhould produce its like, every fpecies produce its own
kind, to prevent a final deflru<5tion o f the fpecies, or the nccefiicy o f a new creation.
For which end he laid down certain regulations, by which each fpecies was to be
propagated, preferved, and fupported, till, in order and courie o f time, they were to
be removed hence : for without that, thofe very beings, which were created at BrlV,
mufi have continued to a final difTolution o f all things; which almighty God, o f his
infinite wifdom, did not think fit. Bur, that he might (till the more manifeft his
omnipotence, he fet all the engines o f his providence to w ork, by which one effect
was to produce another, by means o f certains laws or rules, laid down for the pro­
pagation, maintenance, and fupport, o f all created beings. T h is his divine provi­
dence is called nature, and thefe regulations are called the laws o f nature, by which
it ever operates in its ordinary courfe, producing conception and generation o f ail
things, as it were, from the beginning.
T h e procefs of generation o f the human fpecies, lb far as the male contributes to
it, is as follows : the penis being erefted by an affufion o f blood > the glands at the
fame time tum efied; and the nervous papillx in the glands much robbed, and highly
excited, in coition;, an ejaculatory contraction follows, by which the feed is prcfTcd
40. 3 M ouc
2

6 C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P . H Y S I C I A N ,
out o f the feminal veficles, ancl expelled with fome confiderable force. T h e procefs
o f generation on the part o f the female is th u s: the clitoris being erefted, after the
like manner as the penis in man •, and the neighbouring parts all diftended w ith
blood ; they more adequately embrace the penis in coition : and, by the intumes­
cence, prefs out a liquor from the glands about the neck o f the womb, to facilitate
the paflage o f the penis. A t the fame time, the fibres o f the womb, contra&ing,
open its mouth (which at other times is extremely clofe) for the reception o f the
finer part o f the feed.
From this contact o f the fexes, follows conception, or the production o f an embryo,
which is dfcCted in the following manner: In the fuperficesof the tefticles or ova­
ries o f women, there are found little pellucid fpherules, con fiftingof two concen­
tric membranes, filled with a lymphatic humour, and connected to the furface o f the
ovaria, underneath the tegument, by a thick calix, contiguous to the extremities o f
the minute ramifications o f the Fallopian tubes. T hefe fpherules, by the ufe o f
venery, grow, fwcll, raife, and dilate, the membranes o f the ovary into the form o f
papilla;; till, the head propending from the ftalk*, it is at length feparated from i t ;
leaving it a hollow cicatrix, in the broken membrane o f the o va ry; which, how­
ever, foon grows up again. N ow , in thefe fpherules, while fiill adhering to the
ovary, foetufes have been frequently found: whence it appears, that thefe are a
kind o f ova, or eggs, deriving their ftru&ure from the veffels o f the ovary, and their
liquor from the humours prepared therein. Hence, alfo, it appears, that the F allo ­
pian tubes being fwelled, and ftiffened by the a«
5t o f venery, with their m ufcular
fimbrise, like fingers, may embrace the ovaries, comprefs them, and by that cotn-
prefiion expand their own m ouths: and thus the eggs, now mature, and detached as
before, may be forced into their cavities; and thence conveyed into the cavity o f the
uterus j where they may either be cherifhed and retained, as when they meet with
the male feed; or, if they want that, again expelled. Hence the phenom ena o f
falfe conceptions, abortions, foetufes found in the cavity o f the abdomen, the F a l­
lopian tubes, Szc. F o r, in coition, the male feed, abounding with living animal­
cules, agitated with a great force, a brifk hear, and, probably, with a great quantity
o f animal fpirits, is violently impelled through the mouth o f the uterus, which on
this occafion are laxer than ordinary, into the uterus itfelf* which now, in like
manner, becomes more aftive, turgid, hot, inflamed, and moiftened with the flux o f
its lymph and fpirits, by means of the titiilation excited in the nervous papillae by
the attrition againft the rugae o f the vagina. T h e femen thus difpofed in the uterus,
is retained, heated, and agitated, by the convulfive conftrittion o f the uterus itfelf j
till, meeting with the ova, the fineft and moft animated part enters through the di-
i lated
a n d f a m i l y d i s p e n s a t o r y . 227
laced pores o f the membranula o f the ovum , now become glandulous, is there retain­
ed, nourifhed, dilated, grows to its um bilicus, or navel; ftifles the other lefs lively
animalcules ; and thus is conception cfFe&ed.
T h e egg in the ovarium o f a woman, when impregnated with the male feed, may
be compared to the fmall round white fpot o f the fize o f a fmall pea on the yolk o f
an hen’s e g g ; in which fmall. part, if it is impregnated, the chicken begins to form,
and which is commonly called the tread; though this part is always to be found in
the eggs o f thofe hens that have not cohabited with the cock, but fmaller, and
thefe, not having received the male feed, produce no chickens. Therefore fince an
egg is fo nearly compleated in a hen, without communication with a cock, and fince
there are parts in a woman equally adapted for this purpofe*, it may be prefumed,
that the unimpregnated egg o f a woman, when it proceeds from the ovarium , con-
fifts o f thofe parts which are the rudiments o f the foetal part o f the placenta, and
m em branes; and moft likely, a part, at leaft, o f the rudiments o f the child icfelf;
and may be called the ovarial portion, which when impregnated by the addition o f
the male feed, and afterwards conveyed into the wom b, acquires a further addition
from the womb ictclf♦»which may be called the uteral portion but, if not impreg­
nated, it is difcharged from the womb, without any further growth. T h e firft
thing that appears o f a foetus, is the placenta, like a little cloud, on one fide o f the
external coat o f the e g g : about the fame time the fpine is grown big enough to be
v ifib le ; and a little after the cerebrum and cerebellum appear like two fmall blad­
ders: next, the eyes ftand prominent in the head: then the puodtum (aliens, or
puliation o f the heart, is plainly feen. T h e extremities difeover themfelves lad
o f all. T h e formation o f the bones in a foetus is very gradual and regularly per­
formed. In the firft two months there is nothing o f a bony nature in the w hole;
after this, the hardnefs o f the parts where the principal bones are to be fituated be­
comes by degrees perceptible. D r. Kerkring deferibes the progrefs o f the oftifica-
tion from fkelc-tons which he had prepared from foctufes o f tw o months, and thence
u p to nine. In the firft two months, or till the end o f that tim e, there appears not
any thing b o n y; after this, in the third and fourth months, and fo on, (he (evcral
parts, one after another, acquire their bony nature. In the firft ftages every thing
is membranous, where the bones are to b e ; thefe by degrees tranfmigrate into car­
tilages ; and from thefe, by the fame fort o f change continued, the bones themfelves
are by degrees formed. A ll this is done by nature, by fuch flow, though luch cer­
tain, progreflions, that the niceft eye can never fee it doing, though it eafily fees it
when done.
T hough the ftate o f pregnancy is not a difeafe, yet it is attended with a variety of
complaints which merit great attention, and often require the afiiftance o f medicine;
Some
22$ C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
Som e women indeed are more heahhy during their pregnancy than at any other
tim e v but this is by no means the general cafe: m od o f them breed in forrow, and
are frequently indifpofed during the whole time o f pregnancy. Few fatal difeafes,
however, happen during that period; and hardly any, except abortion, that can be
called dangerous. E very pregnant woman is more or lefs in danger o f abortion.
T h is Ihould be guarded againft with the greateft care, as it not only weakens the
conftitution, but renders the woman liable to the fame misfortune afterwards. A b o r­
tion may happen at any period o f pregnancy, but it is m od common in the fecond
or third month. Sometimes, however, it happens in the fourth or fifth. I f it hap­
pens with the firft m onth, it is ufually called a falfe conception; if alter the feventh
m onth, the child may often be kept alive by proper care. T h e common caufes o f
abortion are, the death o f the ch ild ; weaknefs or relaxation o f the mother* great
evacuations; violent exercife; jum ping, or flepping from an eminence; vom it­
ing, coughing, convulfion-fits, ftrokes on the belly, falls, fevers, difagreeable
fm ells, excefs o f blood, indolence, high living, or the contrary, violent palfions or
affections o f the mind, as fear, grief, & c . W hen any figns o f abortion appear, the
woman ought to be laid in bed on a mattrafs, w ith her head low. She fhould be
kept quiet, and her mind foothed and comforted. She ought not to be kept too hot,
nor to take any thing o f a heating nature. H er food Ihould confift o f broths, rice
and m ilk, jellies, gruels made o f oat-meal, and the like, all o f which ought to be
taken cold. I f fhe be able to bear ir, fhe Ihould lofe, at leaft, half a pound o f blood
from the arm. H er drink ought to be barley-water, Ihar|)ened with ju ice o f lem on;
or Ihe may take half a drachm o f powdered nitre, in a cup o f water-gruel, every
five or fix hours. I f the woman be feized with a violent loofenefs, Ihe ought to
drink the decoction o f calcined hartfhorn prepared. I f Ihe be affeCted with vom it­
ing, let her take frequently forty drops o f the L unar TinCture in a wine-glafs o f cold
fpring water. In general, opiates are o f fervice, but they fhould always be given
with caution. Sanguine robuft women, who are liable to mifearry at a certain time
o f pregnancy, ought always to be bled a few days before that period arrives. By
this means, and perfevering in the Lunar TinCture, they might always efcape that
misfortune.

T H O U G H the management o f women in child-bed has been praCbifed as an em­
ployment fince the ear Ileft accounts o f time, yet it is Hill, in m oll countries, on a
very bad looting. Few women think o f follow ing this employment till they be re­
duced to the neceflity o f doing it for bread. H ence not one in a hundred o f them
have any education, or proper knowledge o f their bufinefs. It is true, that nature,
i: left to hcrfclf, will generally expel the foetus; but it is equally true, that m oll
women
A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y , 22$
women in child-bed require to be managed with (kill and attention, and that they
are often hurt by the fuperflitious prejudices o f ignorant and officious midwives.
T h e mifehief done in this w ay is much greater than is generally imagined ; m oil
o f which might be prevented by allowing no women to pradlife midwifery but fuch
as are properly qualified. W ere due attention paid to this, it would not only bo
the means o f faving many lives, but would prevent the neceffity o f employing men
in this indelicate and difagreeable branch o f medicine, which is, on many accounts,
m ore proper for the other fex. In order to obtain a perfedl idea o f the procefs
o f delivery, and to form a competent knowledge o f difficult child-births, it is ne-
cefTary we fhould firft underftand thofe that are natural. T h e time o f the natural
birth is from the 15th day o f the ninth month to the end o f the 30th o f the fam e:
yet fome women affirm it m ay be fooner or later. H offm an fays, the ufual time
is nine folar months ; and Junker, that, excretions from the uterus being by women
referred to certain lunar phales, they reckon their going with child by the weeks,
and that they ufually exclude the foetus forty weeks from the time o f their being
w ith child, commonly on that very day they wereufed to have their menfes. W hen
this time is arrived, which m ay be known by a remarkable defeent o f the wom b,
and a fubfidence o f the belly, the foetus is mature for d elivery; it then turns round,
and its head falls towards the orifice o f the wom b, asintheannexed plate, where A A
denotes the portion o f the chorion diffedled and removed from its proper place; B ,
a portion o f the am nios; C C the membrane o f the womb d iffe re d ; D D the pla­
centa endued with many fmall veffels by which the infant receives its nourifhment ;
E E the varication o f the veffels which makes up the navel firin g; F F the navel
firing, by which the um bilical veffels are carried from the placenta into the n ave';
G G the infant as it lieth perfedl in the womb ready for delivery ; H the infcrtion
o f the umbilic veffels into the navel o f the infant. T h e orifice o f the womb dilates
by the weight and preffure o f the child; and the chorion and amnios, being dri­
ven forward with the waters they contain, form a kind o f pouch or bladder, at the
faid orifice; which fhould be fuffered to break o f itfelf, or, at leafl, it fhould not
be burft till the woman is in labour. There is a flux o f whitifh matter from the
faid orifice: pains which extend from the loins and groin towards the genital parts:
there is a frequent defire to m ake water, or t o g o to flo o b or a continual tenefmus:
a flux o f the waters from the membranes which contain the child immediately be­
fore the birth, or more early : a trembling o f the lower jo in ts: fometimes the head
achs, and the face looks intenfely red. In this ftate o f things, the midwife ought to
examine the ftate o f the uterus, and relax the vagina by fome oily and m ollifying
remedy, which ought to be kept in readinefs; fhe fhould likewife examine by the
touch, with the fore and middle fingers, introducing them from time to time into
41. 3 N the
the orifice o f the wom b, to djfcern whether it be dilated, contracted, or in an oblique
or ftraight direction * from whence a judgm ent may be formed whether it w ill
com ecafily, or difficultly, Sec. as reprefented in N o. i. o f the annexed plate, where
A denotes the uterus * B B the vagina laid open j C C the os uteri internum, as yet
concra&cd, but in its right fituation ; I) reprefents the manner o f examining the os
uteri with one or more o f the fingers, which if obliquely fituated either forwards to­
ward the os pubis, backwards on the os facrum, o r towards either fide, denotes a
difficult delivery. A s the infant gradually advances, the above-mentioned protube­
rance continually enlarges the pafifage, till the crown o f the head m ayb e fe lt; the
birth is then faid to be advanced one third, and the m idwife may now affift the ex-
dufion. W hen the infant is advanced forward as far as his ears, he is faid to be in
the pafiage, as fiiewn in N o. 2. o f the annexed plate, which reprefents the natural
pofiure o f the infant in the birth, with its head protruding into the os uteri, under
the arch o f the os pubis : A the infant, B B the womb laid open, C C the ofia pubis,
D D the ofia ifehii, E E the ofia ilei, E the navel-firing, G the fecundines adher­
ing to the womb. I f the membranes are not already burfi, they may now be
opened, and the waters, by their effufion, will render the vagina flippery, and pro­
mote the expulfion o f the infant. W hen the child is born, the midwife fhould lay
it on her knees fo as to give iflue to the waters from the mouth, if any has been
imbibed : foon alter, the placenta appears o f itfelf, if not attached to the uterus: if
otherwife, the midwife m uft feparate it gently, by introducing her hand. T h e
navel-firing muft now be cut, having firft made a ligature as well on the child’s fide
as on the mother’s to prevent an haemorrhage. A fte r the child is born, and the
akcr-birth brought away, let a warm linen cloth be applied to the parts, but not
fo as to hinder the flowing o f the loch ia. A n hour after, let the mother take a little
oil o f fweet almonds, to cafe the after-pains, and let a cataplafm o f the oil o f fweet
almonds two ounces and two or three new-laid eggs be boiled together, and laid to
the parts, renewing it every fix hours, for two days: fifteen days after the birth,
the parts may be bathed with an aftringent decoCtion o f redrofes, balauftines, or nut-
galls, in red wine, in order to brace them. I f the labour is long and difficult, it will
be proper to bleed, to prevent inflammations, and to give a little Alicant-w ine,
with the addition o f cinnamon-water, or confectio alkermes.
A difficult delivery is fometimes brought on by the mother, the midwife, or the
fcctus. T h e fault is in the mother, if, when the orifice o f the womb is open, and the
child rightly placed, (he has not ftrengch to expel the foetus, efpecially if the waters
are come away, and the pains ceafe*, or when the mother will not exert herfelfj or
there is a natural fault in the genital parts. In a defeCt o f ftrength, or pains all elfe
being right, a draught o f generous wine (hould be given, with cinnamon and mace,
1 again
X p C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
again and again, if the w ork does not go forward. I f there wants a greater ftimu-
lus, borax, cinnamon, or myrrh, may be given, with a proper drink, which muft be
repeated in an honr or two, if occafion requires. But the abufeof forcing medicines
is dangerous: ftimulating clyfters may be inje&ed now and then, efpecially if the
woman is coftive. T h e midwife fhould alfo prefs back the os coccygis, which tends
to excite the pains, and to eafe the labour. I f the parts are over ftraic, as in the firft
birth, efpecially if the woman is not young, emollient liniments are to be ufed, and
the parts muft be anointed with frefh butter, or oil, and to be diiated gently with
the fingers. I f there is a tum our, caruncle, or membrane, oppofing the birth, a
furgeon’s afiiftance is required. T h e midwife is in fault, when (he haftens the la­
bour before the time, when there are no true pains, when the orifice o f the uterus is
not open, which alone diftinguifhes the true pains from fa lfe: the true time o f birth
muft be waited fo r : the woman muft be compofed, and her fpirits kept up with
comfortable liquors. I f the fault is with the foetus, and the head too large, or the
lhape monftrous, or the fituation preternatural, then forcing medicines are fruitlefs
and noxious; and the foetus muft be brought forth by the feec, by a fkilful hand, or
theinftrument called embry ulcus, as in N o. 9. o f the annexed plate, whether alive
or dead. I f the feec prefent firft, as in N o. 3. the midwife muft be wary, left there
be twins, and left (he fhould take a foot o f each : the feet muft be wrapped in
a dry napkin, and the child m uft be drawn gently, till the wafte is in the orifice o f
the uterus: then the infant’s hands fhould be drawn d o le by the fides *
, and if the
nofe be towards the os pubis, it fhould be turned towards the coccyx, to prevent an
obftacle. Then, the orifice muft be dilated with the fingers, and the woman’s
throws fhould affift the m idwife’s efforts to educe the child. I f the chin is embar-
raffed, the midwife muft difengage it, by putting her finger into the mouth, in order
to turn it to advantage. I f the infant’s head prefents acrofs, as in N o. 4. it muft be
put back, and gently turned to its natural fituation; and if the fhoulder or back
prefents, as in N o. 5. and 6. the fame art muft be ufed. I f the belly, hip, or thigh,
appears firft, as in N o. 7. and 8. the child muft be extracted by the feet, and the mo­
ther muft lie horizontally on her back. I f one or both hands are directed upwards,
2nd lie clofe to the head, the cafe is not lo bad a lome apprehend, for they w ill keep
the orifice dilated, till the head pafies, and prevents ftrangling. I f one k g , or the
feet and hands, appear, they m uft be returned, and the infant brought forth by the
feet, as in N o. 10. and 11. I f the infant is dead, there is generally a collapfion o f the
abdomen; the breaftsare flaccid; the infants bears on the lower partof the pelvis;
and the child, upon motion, rolls like a lum p o f lead. T h e bones o f the fkull are
wrapped over one another; an ichorous lymphatic fanies flows from the uterus;
the mother is fubjeft to fainting. There is no pulfation in the navel firing > it is

foft and indolent to the touch, and abfolutely deprived o f motion. I f the placenta
comes firft, and is hot, the child is alive. A b o ve all, if any part o f the infant’s
body appears, and is fu ll o f fmall veficles livid, foft, and brittle, it is not only dead,
but beginning to putrify. In thefe cafes it muft be extracted by the feet, and if it
cannot be done otherwife, with an inftrum ent; but a man-midwife's affiftance m uft
not be neglefted. W hen the foetus dies before the tim e o f birth, and the membranes
continue whole, it w ill not p u trify; therefore the w ork m uft be left to nature, fo r
birth-pains w ill at length com e on fpontaneoufiy. I f the navel-ftring appears firft,
and is comprefied foon after by the head o f the infant, its life is in danger, and the
remedy is to return the infant, and reduce the cord, till the head fills the orifice ;
but, if this cannot be done, the woman m uft be put in a fuitable pofture, and the
child m uft be extracted by the feet. W hen the placenta prefents itfelf, which is
known by its fpungy, foft, texture, and the great quantity o f blood flowing at the
fame time, it requires fpeedy afiiftance. I f the membranes are entire, they fhould be
broken ; the placenta and membranes fhould be reduced into the uterus, and the
child beextrafted by the feet j which is more eafily performed in the membranes
than in the uterus, and put into a proper fituation: but, if the placenta is dilen-
gaged from its membranes, and thefe are broke, and the placenta, or both, appear
before the infant, they may be brought away firft, and the infant immediately after­
wards. W hen there is a great flux o f blood from outward accidents, the infant
Ihould be immediately delivered by art, though the mother is not in true labour. I f
the uterus is opened, and the vagina relaxed, as in this cafe they commonly are, the
child m uft be extracted by the fe e t; if not, they m uft be mollified with frcfh oil,
and the infant delivered as before. A fter all laborious births, the woman is gene­
rally w eak, and apt to fa in t: therefore, her fpirits (hould be kept up by a glafs o f hot
w ine, or analeptic water, which m uft be repeated as o ft as there is occafion. If, after
the child is born, the placenta does not foon follow , and it adheres to the w om b, the
woman is not to change her pofture immediately, b u t the m idwife's hand is to be
introduced into the wom b, as far as the placenta, taking the navel-ftring fo r a
g u id e ; and, taking hold o f it, fhe is to m ove it gently to and fro, in order to loofen
and extract it. I f it adheres too clofely, it is not to be pulled forcibly, or broken :
it w ill be beft to wait half an hour, keeping the hand in the uterus, for fear o f its
clofing, till it comes away o f itfelf, or may be feparated without force, as in N o.
12, which exhibits the method o f feparating and extracting the placenta from the
wom b, when it does not eafily follow the infant. There the navel-ftring A A is
held by the left hand B , while the right hand D is thereby guided in the collapfed
uterus C C to the placenta E , which is hereby feparated from the uterus. If, through
the unfkilfulnefc o f the m idwife, the orifice o f the womb clofes, before it is com e
aw ay,

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y .
aw ay, aloetic pills muft be taken every evening. I f it putrifies, the patient dies, or
falls into dangerous fevers. A fter delivery, the woman fhould be put into bed, and
a folded fheet put under her hips, in order to receive the lochia. W arm linen fhould
fee applied to the genital parts, to keep out the air, and a comprefs, dipped in warm
vin e, Ihould be applied to the belly, but not too tight. I f there are violent pains
after delivery, they generally proceed from the after-birth’s being retained, or part o f
i t ; from blood clotted, or concreted, in the uterus; from hard labour j from adefedt
in the flux of the lochia ; or from wind, efpetially if the woman has not been fwath-
ed in a proper way. In this cafe, hot diluents are proper, oi* an infufion o f camomile
flowers, drunk as tea, or broths with carraway-feeds; or wormwood, or thin orange-
peel one ounce, or a bitter tindture in a proper infufion, taken hot. A n ounce or two
o f oil o f fweet almonds, taken in a hot vehicle, is alfo excellent.
I f violent pains continue after delivery of-the child, fo as to give fufplcion o f more,
being left behind, the greateft care and circumfpeftion fhould be ufed in examining
the ftateof the uterus, and watching an opportunity to extra tt them in thofe favour­
able moments when the efforts of nature and the mother’s throws mutually confpire
to promote the birth ; and in which the utmoft (kill and caution is requifite, or both
mother and offspring are liable to perifh. Thefe cafes, when they happen, are ge­
nerally attended with the more difficulty from the mid wife not knowing the ufualpo-
fition o f a plural conception. I have therefore given the annexed plate o f a recent
cafe, where three children werefafely delivered, who, withthemother, arc all in a fair
way o f doing well.
T h e moil ratal diforder consequent -upon delivery is the puerperal or child-bed
fever-, and there is not any difeafe that requires to be treated with more (kill and
attention than this; confequently the bed afliftancc ought always to be obtained as
fbon as poffible. In women o f plethoric conftitutions, bleeding will generally be
proper at the beginning* it ought however to be ufed with caution, and not to be
repeated unlefs where the figns o f inflammation rife h igh ; in which cafe it will alfo
be necefiary to apply a blifter-to the region o f the womb. D uring the rigour, or
cold fir, proper-means fhould be ufed to abate its violence, and fhorten its duration.
F o r this purpofe the patient may drink freely o f warm diluting liquors, and, if low,
may take now and then a cup o f white-wine-whey, warm applications to the ex­
tremities, as heated bricks, battles or bladders filled with warm water, and fuch-
like, may alfo be ufed with advantage. Emollient clyfters o f m ilk and water, or
o f chicken water, ought to be frequently adminiftered through the courfe o f the
tiHeafe. Thefe prove beneficial by promoting a difeharge from the inteftines, and
alfo by ailing as a kindly fomentation to the womb and parts adjacent. Great care
however is-requifite in giving them, on account o f the tendernefs o f the parts in
4 t. 3 0 the
the pelvis at this time. T h e medicine always found to fucceed beft in this difeafe is
the Lunar T in ttu re. T h is, if frequently repeated, w ill often put a flop to the vo­
m iting, and at the fame time leflen the violence o f the fever. I f it runs o ff by (loo),
or if the patient be reftlefs, a few drops o f laudanum, or fome fyrup o f poppies, may
occafionally be added. T o avoid this fever, every woman in child-bed ought to be
kept perfectly eafy > her food fhould be light and Ample, and her bed-chamber cool,
and properly ventilated. There is not any thing more hurtful to a woman in this
fituation than being kept too warm. She ought not to have her body bound too tight,
nor to rife too foon from bed, after delivery; catching cold is alfo to be avoided;
and a proper attention fhould be paid to cleanlinefs. T o prevent the m ilk-fever,
the breads ought to be frequently draw n; and, if they are full previous to the on-
fet o f a fever, they fhould, upon its firft appearance, be drawn, to prevent the m ilk
from becoming acrid, and its being abforbed in this ftate.

I T is proper, immediately after children are born, to fearch narrowly whether they
have received any injury, either in the womb or in the delivery itfelf. Brpifes in-
the head, or elfewhere, occafioned by the rough treatment o f the midwife j and
fwellings, occafioned by a prefTure againft the internal orifice, may be cured or dif-
cuffed by the follow ing m ixture: take camphorated fpirit o f wine and oil o f fw eet
almonds, o f each two drachm s; compound fpirit o f lavender, half a drachm : mix*
L et the injured part be frequently anointed therewith. It may alfo be now and then
fomented with warm m ilk. But, if the fwelling tends to fuppuration, it ought to be-
immediately forwarded with mucilage plaifter, diachylon with gum , or a poultice o f
bread and m ilk. A n d after the difcharge o f matter,, ufe Arcteus’s liniment, warm ,
and mixed with a little Peruvian balfam, for the dre/Tings, covering them w ith a-
Ample diachylon plaifter.
T h e gripes in children fometimes prove fo violent, as to throw them into univer-
fal convulfions, or to caufe what is called a convulfion o f the bowels. W hen the
diet is fufpefted to caufe this diforder, it is ufual to boil carraway-fecds and laurel-
leaves along with the panada, or to m ix with it a little wine or brandy. I f the me­
conium has not been duly purged away, five grains- o f rhubarb fhould be givea,
twice a-week, till the bowels are evacuated ; or a little oil o f fweet alrnonds, and
fyrup o f violets-, where the infant is weak. W hen the taking in too much m ilk is
fufr^cted to be the caufe, let it be debarred the breaft a Ihort time, and in the mean
while exhibit the following m ixture: take fyrup o f peach blofl'oms and rhubarb,
o f each half an oun ce; o f annifeed, two d ro p s: m ix. L e t a fmall fpoonful o f this
be given occasionally, while the fymptoms laft. W hen the curdling o f the m ilk
cdufes
234 C U L P E P E R ' S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,

caufes the gripes, proceed as follow s: take rhubarb powdered fine, and magncfut
alba, o f each ten grains; oil o f annifeed, one drop: m ix, G ive half this fo ra
purge, in afpoonful o f the mother’s m ilk, and repeat the dofe two or three times
if there be occafion. W hen worms are the caufe o f the gripes, the readicft way to
remove them is by giving iE thiop’s mineral and rhubarb mixed in equal quantities,
about five grains at a time, twice a*day. I f wind be the caufe, the belly o f the child
may be anointed with a m ixture o f two parts oil o f fweet almonds and one part
French brandy; wrapping the part up warm afterwards with a flannel.
T h e fymptoms o f cutting teeth generally begin about the fifth or fixth month, at
which time fome o f the fore teeth rife, and occafion great pain, or even convulficns.
Children have then com m only an itching, heat, pain, and fwelling, in the gu m s;
their fpittle rifeth m u ch ; they are refllefs and feverifh, fomctimes loofe, and fome-
times coftive. A few days before any tooth is cut, the gum immediately above ic
appears thin and whitifh, its Tides being fwelled and inflamed. Children o f g ro iV
habit, and who breed their teeth with coflivenefs, are generally in m oll danger T h e
following mixture, given occafionally, will mitigate the pain, during cutting o f
teeth: take black cherry water, two ounces; compound piony»;'ater, two drachms;
confection o f kermes, two fcruples; Sydenham’s liquid Vaudanum, fifteen drops:
mix. L et one fpoonful be given at a time, when tue child is very reftlcfs.
T h cfe little ulcerous eruptions in the-^outh called the thrufh, which fometimes
appear early, and f o m e t i m e s t i l l the third or fourth year, are accounted danger­
ous when jo ii*£ \vich a fever, and arc always troublefome. T h e child here fliould
be kept moderately cool, as in a common fever, and a fm all blifler may be applied
to the neck, if the diforder be great. In the mean time ufc the following ju le p :
take black cherry water, four ounces; treacle water, one ou n ce; lemon juice, fix
drachms; fpirit o f fweet nitre and fpt. volatile oleofum, o f each fifteen drops:
m ix. G ive a fpoonful or tw o every third or fourth hour; and let the ulcers in the
mouth be cleanfed with the follow ing gargle: take barley deco&ion, three ounces $
beft vinegar, one ounce; fyrup o f mulberries, fix drachms : mix. T h is fliould be
ufed twice or thrice a-day, w ith a fofe linen rag, or the nurfe’s finger.
Coughing, crying, violent motion, and tight fwathing, are apt ro caufe ruptures
in the tender bodies o f infants. W h ile the rupture is frefh, it may be remedied by
the conftant wearing o f a trufs, made for that purpofe. Aftringent fomentations,
made o f pomegranate peels, balauftine, and red rofe flowers, boiled in lime water,
and mixed with red wine, m ay be ufed after the inteftines are replaced, which flrnild
be immediately done. Sm all ruptures in the groin and privities, happening fre­
quently in children, are ufually cured with fmall difficulty, by only plaifters and
bandages; but, when they continue obftinate, the child fhould be kept in the cra­
dle, as quiet as poflible.

W hen the futures o r joining Teams o f the head continue to long open, it is
thought a bad fign. In this cafe it is ufual to rub the head often with a little warm
rum or brandy, m ixed with the white o f an egg, and palm o il; a red cloth being
conftantly worn over the part. B ut, when this diforder proceeds from a collection
o f water in the head, it muft be cured by iflues in the neck, perpetual blotters, and
purgatives. A . purgative diet-drink may be made o f rhubarb and fweet fennel feeds,
to be drunk daily. W hen there is a diforder direCtly oppofite to this, called head-
mouldfhoty which Agnifies a too clofe locking o f the futures, it is ufually left to
nature, as admitting o f no help from medicine.
Breakings-out in children, when they are fuperficial, contain a thin ^yellow m at'
ter, and leave the ik in beneath red when the fcabs fall off, are rather falutarythau
hurtful. It is cuftom ary, however, to purge with a few grains o f rhubarb, and
anoint the puftules with cream, or oil o f almonds, o r extra& o f Saturn, com m only
called G oulard. A little bafilicon likewifc, fpread thin upon lint, has been found
ufesul; and the body fhould be kept open. B u t, when thefe cafes grow inveterate
and ftubborn, there can be no fafer method than a courfe o f A ithiop’a mineral and
rhubarb.
T h e rickets is a diforder o f the bones o f children, caufing a bunching out or
crookednefs thereof. It may be occafioned byfw athing a child too tight in fome
places, and too loofc in others; by placing it in an inconvenient, or too often in
the fame, pofture *
, fufFering it to be long w e t; not giving it proper m otion, or
ufing it to one arm only: It may alfo be owing to the parents, or fome defeat in
the digeftive faculty, or a vifeidity o f the blood. B ut the moft evident caufe o f the
rickets, is the violence done tothe body by.prefTc.re or fwathing, while the bonesare
but in a cartaliginous Rate. A d d to this, external injury by falls, blows, difloca-
tions, or fradures, which fpecics fometimes brings on an afthma, confumption, or
crookednefs o f the back. U pon the firft appearance o f this difeafe, which ufually
happens between the eighth month and the fifth year, the part it affe&s grows
flaccid .and w eak; the childbecom es pale, fickly, Hothful, and lofes the ufe o f its
feet, though it had it before; the head grows too large for the trunk, and cannot
be managed by the mufcles o f the n eck ; knotty excrefcences appear in the wrifts,
ancles,-and tops o f the ribs; the bones o f the legs and thighs become crooked,
which makes the motion difagreeable; and fometimes the arms alfo arediftorted,
and appear knotty. I f thefe fymptoms continue long, a difficulty o f breathing,
cough, and hyfteric fever, come on; the belly fwells, the pulfe grows weak, and
the child’s life is in danger. T h e rickets is moft com m only cured, when taken in
tim e, and while the child is very young. B ut, if it continues long, the patient gene­
ral lg

rally becomes a dwarf, and is fickly or phthifical during life, efpecially if the
back be any way affcfted. A ricketty child Ihould be ufed to motion, and kept as
m uch as poflible in a pofture oppofite to that which his bones arc inclined to. It is
alfo ferviceable, before the diftemper is confirmed, to plunge the child two or three
times every morning in a tub o f cold water, during the months o f M ay and June
efpecially. A fter being taken out the laft time, it is to be well dried, and put im ­
mediately into a bed or cradle, there to fweat freely for an hour or more, as the
ftrength will b ear; and, when it grows cool again, it m ay be taken up and fhifeed.
T h e back-bone alfo, and joints, may every night be anointed before the fire, with
the white o f an eg g , beat into a water with a whifk or fp o on ; or with a liniment of
rum and palm oil. It is ufual likewife to apply a plaifter o f minium and oxy-
croceum along his back, and to rub him all over before the fire, but niolUy the
parts affe&ed, with a dry Imen cloth. B ut perhaps nothing can exceed the follow­
ing liniment and plaifter; the former for anointing the joints, and principal parts
aflfe&ed, with a warm hand,once or twice a-day; and the latter for applying to the
back, or any particular part, being fpread upon leather. T a k e nerve ointment,
w ith oils o f palm and bays, o f each one ounce •, balfam o f Peru, and oil o f nutmeg
by expreffion, o f each two drachms*, oil o f cloves and chem ical oil o f amber, o f
each ten drops; compound fpirit o f lavender, one ounce; fpirit o ffa l ammoniac,
two drachm s: m ix for a liniment. T a k e plafters o f cum m in, brown minium, and
herniaoi and oxycroceum, o f each haif an ounce*
, balfam o f Peru, one drachm ;
powder o f red rofe flowers, and armenian bole, o f each half an ounce; oils o f amber
and camphire, o f each one drachm ; oil o f parfley, enough to m akea confidence for
a plafter. W hen the diftemper feems fixed and obftinate, iffiies may be cut in the
arms and neck, efpecially if the head be large, and the child o f a grofs habit.
O f B A R R E N N E S S i s W O M E N , a n d I N S U F F I C I E N C Y i s M E N .
B A R R E N N E S S is fuch a ftate o f a woman's body as indifpofes it, upon the
ufe o f the natural means, to conceive and propagate her fpecies. T h is diftemper
proceeds from many fources, which may be reduced to thefe two general heads:
F irft,— A n indifpofition o f the parts to receive the male lemen in the a<ft o f copu­
lation, or that vital effluvium dreaming from it which alone can impregnate the
ovaria. Secondly,— A n inaptitude to retain and nourifh the vital particle after it
is injected, fo as to make it grow and expand its parts, till it becomes a proper foe­
tus. T h e reception o f the feed is hindered by many caufes *
, as, immature age,
when by reafon o f the narrownefs o f the genital pafTagcs the woman cannot admit
the virile member, or at leaft not without great pain, which makes her diflike co­
pulation; and old age hath fometimes the fam eeffeft; for, in elderly virgins, the
41. 3 R parts
parts are fo ftraitened for want o f ufe, that they cannot without difficulty con­
tribute to the means o f generation. W om en who are lame alfo, or have their
limbs distorted, or their hips depreffed, cannot always lie in fuch a polture as is ne-
cefiary for a fit reception o f the fcmen. T o o m uch fat likewife ftops the paflage,
particularly, when the omentum preffes upon the orifice o f the wom b, and renders
the copulation incommodious. A n d , when a woman is troubled with a cold intem­
perament o f the w om b, fhe becomes dull and indifferent as to conjugal embraces,
in which file hardly enjoys any pleafure, or is fo fiow ly m oved, that the inner orifice
o f the womb does not ojnm feafonably to receive the man’s feed. T h e paffions o f
the mind are alfo a great hindrance to fertility, efpecially hatred between man and
wife, whereby the wom an, having an averfion to enjoyment, does not fupply fpirics
fuffieient to make the genital parts turgid at the tin e o f coition: nor can the wom b
then kindly meet the effluvium , and draw it into its cavity in a due manner. Sw el­
lings, ulcers, callofities, obftruttions, diftortions o f the genital or neighbouring
parts, may be fo many impediments to the proper reception o f the male femen, or its
retention and nutriment after reception. A ftone in the bladder may have the fame
effect, as may a too great moiftnefs and fiipperinefs o f the womb or vagina, when
they are filled with excrem em itious humours, and rendered too lax. Conception is
alfo hindered by a hettic, hydropic, or feverifh fickly, habit j by a deficiency or ob-
ftru&ion o f the m onthly courfcs, when the natural brifknefs o f the blood is w anting;
by an immoderate flux o f the co'urfes, which impoverifhes the flu id s; by the whites,
which, continuing too long, relax the glands o f the w om b, and drown, as it were,
the prolific particles and too often by fecret vemr)\ which utterly deftroys the tone
and vigour o f the parts. T h is may particularly happen on the fide o f the man,
fince it induces a feminal weaknefs, and a want o f a proper ere&ion. A virulent
gonorrhea or ill-cured venereal cafe, faft living, a worn-out conftitution, and want
o f animal fpirits, or fuffieient feed, are fo many obftacles to procreation. Som e­
times, indeed, there may be no defeat difcoverable on either fide, and yet the parties
remain without iflue, notwithftanding their moft earneft endeavours to the contrary.
W hen a fwelling actually appears in the uterine vefTels, when the menfes arc irregu­
lar, or the whites have continued long, if, by the ufe o f proper means, the woman
does not conceive under thefe circumftances, her own rcafon will di&ace to her, that
fhe mufl have immediate recourfe to the remedies preferibed for thofe particular
complaints. W hen fhe is very fat and bulky, and has room to think her concep­
tion is thereby hindered, her only way is to corredl that vicious habit by a thin fpare
diet, and proper evacuations. I f the lips o f the privities, or the entrance o f the va­
gina, are clofed, it is manifeft to the fig h t: bur, when the orifice o f the womb is Ihut
up, it is difficult to be known, while the patient is very young, and till her courfes
come

A N D F A M I L Y D I S P E N S A T O R Y .
com e d ow n : but, when the patient Is once certain that it happens by any o f thefe
caufes, it may not be rafh to fay, that conception is impracticable till they are re­
m oved . W hen there is a total want o f erection, or o f leminal matter, on the fide o f
the male, generation is not only impoflible, but the cure very precarious and diffi­
cult. Preparatory to the cure o f infertility in either fex, it is proper to ufe evacua­
tions, unlefs any particular fymptom fliew them to be dangerous. Bleeding, lenient
purgatives, fuch as the folutive eleCtuary, and a gentle vom it o f ipecacuanha, efpe-
cially if the perfon be plethoric, or cacochymic, cannot but be o f great fervice;
becaufe molt o f the medicines to be preferibed, in this caie, being aromatic, or
highly nourilhing, may otherjpile bring on inflammatory diforders, as the pleurify,
inflammation o f the lungs, and the like. D ue evacuations having been complied
with, proceed with the following le n g th e n in g electuary: take roots o f fatyrion
and eringo candied, o f each one ou n ce; powders o f cinnamon, fweet fennel feeds,
and preserved ginger, o f each half an ounce j m3cc, roots o f contrayerva and Spa-
nilh angelica, o f each one drachm ; troches o f vipers, one ounce; juice o f kermes,
fix drachm s; tincture o f cantharides, half a drachm ; fyrup o f cloves, a fufficienc
quantity to make an ele&uary. Let the quantity o f a large nutmeg be taken every
morning early, at about five o’clock every afternoon, and at night going to bed;
and let this courfe be continued as long as the cafe requires. Three fpoonfuis o f
the following wine Ihould be drunk after each dofe, to the efficacy o f which it will
m ake a confiderable addition. T a k e canary wine, two quarts; cloves, nutmegs,
long pepper, fmaller cardamum feeds, Virginia fnake-root, and cochineal, o f each
one drachm and a h a lf; fyrup o f citron peels, four ounces : infule the aromatics,
and mix in the fyrup. I f thefe, upon trial, fhould not be found eftedhial; the fol­
lowing, which is more ftimulating and powerful, Ihould be taken, viz. takeconferve
o f orange-peels, one ounce; Venice treacle, and confe&ion o f kermes, o f each half
an ounce; fpecies o f diambrse, winter’s bark, powder o f faffrorv, fmaller carda­
mum feeds, carraways, powdered nutmegs, Virginian fnake-root, and cloves, o f each
one drachm ; viper’s fle(h, an ou n ce; balfamic fyrup, enough to make an ele&uary.
L e t this be taken in the fame quantities, and at the fame intervals, as the other,
drinking after it four fpoonfuis o f the following infufion: take cinnamon |>ow-
dered, one ounce; fweet fennel feeds, bruifed, and lavender flowers, o f each h alf
an ounce; Spanifh angelica root, ginger, contrayerva, mace, and cochineal, o f each

raifes the appetite to venereal embraces, but removes the ufual obftruttions o f ferti­
lity ; prepares the femen for perform ing its office, and the ova for impregnation. In
old age it warms, com forts, and excites the generative parts to admiration, and
feldom fails o f perform ing a cure in forty or fifty days, if duly followed, and the
barrennefs or im becility be not abfolutely incurable by medicine ; particularly if
affifted with a nourifhing diet, o f which plenty o f good potatoes and rich m ilk
ought to make a confiderable part. W hen there is a fufficient ereCtion, and only
the feed is wanting, all ftim ulating and aromatic medicines m ull be entirely om it­
ted, and the cure attempted with the TinCture only, affifted with a nourifhing diet •,
to which the ufe o f external liniments muft be added. T a k e nerve ointment, tw o

drachm s; chym ical oils o f lavender, cloves, and rhodium , o f each four drops: m ix.
Anoint the parts between whiles with this linim ent; that is to fay, the penis and fero-
tuni if it be for a man, and the pudendum if for a Woman, and it will not fail o f ad-
miniftering com fort and ftrength. I f any thing yet more ftim ulating be defired, a
drachm and a half, or tw o drachms, o f tinCture o f cantharides, may be added to ei­
ther preparation. B ut I would not advife any debilitated perfonto be too bufy with
high provocatives, becaufe they may incite to the ufe o f venery before nature is pre­
pared for it, and lb exhauft the animal fpirits more by one fingle a£t o f coition than
it would be by twenty in the common way. It is better, therefore, for m oll per-
t'ons, to keep to the liniments and TinCture only, that their ftrength and ability
may be always equal to their inclination. T o recover the tone and vigour o f the
internal parts in wom en, ule the fo llo w in g: take cloves, nutmegs, ginger, Spaniffi
angelica, o f each one d rach m ; aloes wood, mace, cardamuin feeds, o f each one
fcruple*, mint-leaves, one handful; cantharides, tw o drachm s; infufe them in a
pint o f white wine, and boil over a gentle fire till it is reduced to twelve ounces :
then ftrain it, and injeCt two ounces warm into the uterus every night going to bed,
taking at the fame time forty drops o f the Lunar T in ftu re in a wine-glafs o f cold wa­
ter. W hen the parts abound with moifture, reftringent or aromatic fum igations
may bcufed to advantage, as in the cafe o f the whites, and o f the falling down o f the
wom b and fundament. T h e ingredients proper in the prcfcnt cafe, are ftorax, cloves,
nutm egs, caftor, ginger, Spaniffi angelica roor, and galangals. E qual quantities o f
thefe may be taken powdered, and m ixed together, and about an ounce o f the m ix­

S ievin g before cautioned againft the too frequent ufe o f venery, especially for thofe
w ho feem to be infertile through weaknefs, it will be proper ju ft to hint the moft
aufpiciousfeafons for performing the conjugal aft to good purpofe. It has been
found, that, though a woman may conceive at any time during the three weeks that
her courfes are entirely off, yet (he is more apt to do fo immediately after their
ceafing, than at any other time between the j>eriod$ o f their return. T h is hint may
be made ufe o f by weakly people, where the man and the woman are both equally
prudent and temperate. W hen the lips o f the privities grow together, they are
cautioufly to be feparated by tncifion, and the fides kept afunder for fome time by
rags dipped in a proper ointment. And, if the mouth o f the womb fhould happen
to be d o led , a proper-peffary o f cork, cafed over with wax, may be introduced to
keep it open. But, the afliftanceofa fkilful furgeon being always neceffary in (hefe
extraordinary cafes, Ichooien ot to infift on them any longer. I flail add only a few
words, direfted peculiarly to the men, who find themfelves incapable to propagate
their fpecies, though they have not any natural defeft in the inftruments o f genera*
tio n : for, as to abfoluee impotcncy and incapacity o f copulation, as it m ud be ma-
nifeft to the fight, either from the want o f ereftion, or due proportion o f the penis
or a deficiency o f the tefticles, fo it is what no man will pretend to cu re; on which
account our laws have given the wife a remedy, where there can be none for the
hufband, by allowing her to fue out a divorce, and marry another man. A fimple
gleet, brought on by felf-pollution, is one o f the greateft caufcs o f infufficicncy. It
greatly debilitates the whole man, is attended with weaknefs, and oftentimes pain in the
back, heavinefs and pain in the tefticles, and without help ufually terminates in that
kind o f confumption which is called a tabes dorfalis,orconlum ption o f the back. It
is a conftant oozing o f a clear feminal matter, which diftinguifhes ic from an impure
venereal running. A man that is troubled with this (hocking complaint, either
from natural infirmity, or habitual vice, (hould never attempt to propagate his fpe­
cies, till fuch time as he is perfectly cured* for, befides that his endeavours would
be ineffeftua), they would infallibly heighten his infirmity. T h e beft medicines in
th e whole body o f phyfic for this dangerous diftemper, are thole ju ft before men*
tioned i and the fame directions fliould be cxaftly followed b y thofc men whofe feed
is rendered too thin and watery, though without any fuch luxation o f die feminal
veficls as occafions a fimple gleet * and alfb by thofe men, who through weaknefs o f
•the pa. is, are apt to emit their feed as foon as they entertain any amorous thoughts,
b y which means they are not only hindered from copulation, but even from fruition
itfelf. In both thefe cafes, as well as in a fimple gleet, abftinence from conjugal
em braces, and perfevering the ufe o f the Solar T in ftu re, with invigorating
4 ** 3 £ food
food, fuch as jellies, broths, oyftcrs, and all agglutinating meats, are the molt effe ct
tual means o f obtaining a cure.
T here is a certain occu lt and feeret fpecies o f barrennefs, that cannot be attributed
to any o f the caufes before afligned, or indeed to any vifible caufe at all. Tht$v
happens when no manner o f d e fcd is difcoverable, on the fide either o f the male or
fem ale, and yet they fhall, againft their inclinations, remain without jflue. M any
odd conjectures have been darted on this account, concerning the jx>ffiblc caufes o f
fterility, when neither perfon appears to be in fault. Som e fuperftitiouspeople have
im puted.it.to forcery, and recourfe has been had to incantations, amulets, charm s,
and magic rites, in order to the cure. But people o f undem anding give no heed to>
fuch fables, being fatisfied, that when both parties are o f fuitable years, brifk, and
not labouring under any apparent weaknefe or indifpofition, if fertility do not fol-
low their nuptial intercourfe, therem uft be fome real and mechanical reafon for it,
though not apparent to the fenfes. W hen there appears no deficiency or defeCt in
either the man or wom an, and none o f the before-memioned.caufes o f barrennefe
exift, we mutt then recur to the real phyfical caufe, which is confidered and under­
wood by very few. It is what is called the temperament^ conjiUtUton, or complexion \ if
the man be o f a hot temperament,, the woman ftiould be o f a cold o n e; if he be o f
die dry temperament, fhe ftiould be o f the m oift: but, if both be o f a dry or both,
o f a moift confiscation, they cannot propagate, though neither may be barren, fingly
confidered, and, if joined with an apt conftitucion, m ight both become fru itfu l.
It muft fall under every one’s obfervation, that both women and men,, who m arry
more than once, will have children by one marriage, and not by another; which,
w ill certainly confirm what is above afierted. A n d again,, there are other caufes
in nature, much more abftrufe and occult than the foregoing, whereby men and
women prove barren, though, to all external appearances, their conformation is
every way congenial to procreation. T h is caufe, foftered in the mother’s wom b,
and having its root in the conftruftion o f the zodiacal figns and planetary influence .
under which the em bryo is conceived and nourifhed, is totally incurable. So like-
wife the variety o f parts, both male and female, have their caufe in the conftrudtion
o f the heavenly bodies, which predominate and govern their conception and birth *
,
for it is certainly found; that, if the Sun be configurated with the M oon, in the
degrees o f M ercury, and M ars and Venus irradiate tho fame, in mafeuline figns,
the man born under fuch an influence will exceed in-chat which is natural, having
thofc parts in excefs which ace proper to men* but the women fo born will have a
conformation o f parts preternatural and mixed *
,- but, if M ars and Venus be confti-
tuted after a mafeuline manner in feminine figns, the men will be fubjeft to a m ix*
cure o f fex, and the women to excefs o f parts and violent luft. A ll thefe fpecula-

eTons, wonderful as they are, and a thoufand others, whole cffedb, though unfeen,
are molt fenfibly felt, are fully explained in my Illuftration and Difplay o f the O c­
cu lt Sciences ; where it is plainly Ihewn, that, the more we enquire into the pathlefs
ways o f nature, the more readily we deduce a radical caufe for all her operations.
O f S Y M P A T H Y a n d A N T I P A T H Y .
T O underftand the properties o f fympathy and antipathy, is, in fa£t, to take into
our comprehenfion the univerfal fyftem o f nature, with her obvious and occult pro­
perties, and the gradations and confent o f parts o f all its atoms. T h is ftudy be­
comes all men ♦, but- more efpecially thofe who* pra&ife phyfic, fince their effects
not unfrequently .preferve life, or deltroy it •, and* in the beginning, middle, and
end, o f difeafes, the refult m ay be always known. Sympathy and antipathy are
found in all things*, and, if traced, account for thofe wonderful occurrences in na­
ture, which otherwife appear altogether inexplicable. A ll vegetable and mineral
productions have not only a wonderful fympathetic power with their own fpecies,
but fo likewife has all animated.nature ; and. more particularly man. It is certainly
true that this celeftial invifible principle is born with us, and emanates from the
centre o f the intellectual foul,, combined with the cerreftrial body ; and, parting
through its nerves, forms an atmofphere. around us,, whereby the fenfations o f fym­
pathy and antipathy, o f love and.hatred^ofjo y and grief, and all the propenfities o f
human nature,, are by a collifion o f rays, which reciprocally cohere or repel what­
ever comes in contact with them, that the effect is made manifest to our fenfes.
H ence it is, that favoury high-feafoned meats, feen or fmelt, excite the appetite and
affect the glands and parts o f the mouth ; that an impudent or (hameful thing, feen
or heard, affefts the cheeks with blulhes; and fo, on the contrary, if a thing pleafe,
it afi&ts the praecordia, and excites the mufcles o f the face-and mouth to laughter;
if it grieve, it affedks the glands o f the eyes, fo as to cccalion tears, and irritates th e ,
mufcles o f the face into an afpeft o f cryin g; fo kitting, though the delirium or
pleafure is excited by. the lips, yet the moft fenfible irritation falls upon the genital
parts, which are rendered turgid, ftiflF, and apt for procreation, as the fum and
centre, or full end and com pletion, o f all fublunary enjoyments. And hence the
caufe o f thofe indefcribable pattions, love, luft, inclination, fympathetic afFc&ion,:-
& c . for if wc fee a limb amputated, or a.violent blow ftruck, we cannot help feeling-
a fympathetic pain in the fclf-fame member o f our own bodies; whichris-the reafon
w hy thofe perfons can never make good furgeons, whofe conception,and birth were
irradiated by the Itrong fympathetic rays c f benefic ftars, or,' as it is commonly
termed, inherit ftrong fym pathizing pattions. So again, if either man or woman.

look upon brutes in the aft o f copulation, it fympathetically affefts the fame organs
in themfelves, and excites to lafcivioufnefs and luft.
Some perfons, we find, are fo delicately organized, as to become violently ena­
moured with an objefl at firft fight, without ever having exchanged a fingle w ord;
and itoften happens that there is no alternative but death or the immediate enjoyment
o f the beloved •perfonl T his is produced by a fympathy o f fouls, united by a com ­
bination o f felf-reflefted rays, which reciprocally cohere from the male to the fem ale,
and from the female to the male, by the aftion o f the intelleftual foul on the folids
and fluids o f the body ; and, as this combination o r collifion o f rays is formed ac­
cording to the different principles from whence it afits, and the organs o f fenfe on
which it ftrikes, fo it excites a fweet vibratory delirium in the brain, which confti-
tutes that ardent affeflion and longing defire-for the perfon, whofe genial effluvium
had thus drawn forth or excited the pafflon o f love. A n d , it is by this alone, we can
account for thofe perfections o f beauty and merit difcoverable by one man's fenfes,
to which another w ill continue for ever infenfible and blind.
It is from a fimilar caufe that we define the longing o f a pregnant woman, and
its effeCt upon the foetu s; for, as like produces its like, and the child takes its
frame from the external members o f its parents in the aCl o f coition, fo there is a
fympathy and concordancy betwixt the child’s members and thofe o f its m other;
therefore, whatever member the mother touches atuhe time her foul is drawn forth
in longing after feme elementary fubftance, the fame member o f the child receives
the imprefllon, and an external mark is produced, according to the nature and qua­
lity o f the thing longed for. B u t, this imprefflon can only take place before the em ­
bryo has quickened; for, till then, the child is paftxve, and the generative cflence o f
the mother aCrive, whence follows a confent o f p arts; but, when the light o f life
is kindled in the foetus, it lives in its own fpirit, and is no longer fubjed to this
affcCtion, nor fo liable to abortion.
W e might here adduce ten thoufand curious inftances o f the effeCts o f fympathy
and antipathy, as well from natural hiftory as from the O ccu lt Sciences; bur, as
this would be foreign to my purpofe, and too m uch enlarge the prefent publication, I
fhall referve a very fu ll difeuffion o f this fubjed for a work 1 fhcrtly intend to publifh,

prevent its returning into the blood ; therefore it is cf-
teemed ufeful in fomc inflammatory fevers, droplics, and
certain Rages of the chryHaUme or watery fmall-pox;
cfpecially if the puftules fubfide, and the extremely vifeid
matter of the difeafe can neither be brought to fuppiu

fuch as arc of an acid nature do more harm titan good,
by contracting the emunitorics of the fativa and mucus,

The foap here is added purely to promote the diflolu-
tionof the aloes in theftoraacli; for, pills made up of
raifins, and fubflances not eafily ditToluble, frequently
pafs through the body entire: hence, by the purgative
quality of the aloes, and detergent property of tire foap,
the glaires and vifeidities of the inteftines are diflolved
and carried off; therefore the pills are flomachic, anti,
febrile, and excellent in nephritic and cholic pains.—
Moreover, the aloes, being hepatic, forward the dif-
charge of the bile, whilft, by the concomitancy of the
foap, it breaks the obflrullions of the liver, blends and
aflimilates the humours. Hence it appears how advan­
tageous and effcnt'ul it is to adapt and combine medicines
judictoufly.

ties. The llrong purges incrcafcd the diftemper. Soap,
lixivial falts, balfam of gilcad, nitre, and the like, all
proved abortive. Tins draught brought unexpected re­
lief, by procuring reft, and caufing a copious difehargr
of water. By repeating the medicine for fomc time,
every eight hours, and then only twice a-day, and after­
wards ufing corroborants, or medicines that produce
ftrength of body, &c. the cure was perfectly completed.

to cure an afthnia, but particularly the WHOOPING-

T
H E temperature, virtues, and ufe, o f Plants, as ferving to heal or fuf-
tain the body in health ; as alfo their dangerous qualities, and the remedies
againft them *
, are well worthy our enquiry. T h is fpeculation is divided
into two parts, t. Therapeutic or curatory. 2. Threptic or alimentary. In both
which, vegetables may be confidered according to their fubftance and confiftence,
or elfe according to their accidents.I
.
I. A ccording to their fubftance or confiftence, they are, 1. T hin or grofs. 2. L a x
or conftrift. 3. Clam m y o f brittle. 4. H eavy or light. Tenuity o f parts is in
thofe things which areaeriousin eflence and fubftance j which, being fubtile, doeaftly
communicate their virtue unto any liquor, and are o f eafy diftribution in the body,
eaftly actuated, and not long abiding; and is in matter not much compact, but
eaftly d ivi.ed by natural heat, having little o f earth, and that mixed with much hu~
m idity, or elaborated by fiery heat, as in things very acid, lharp, and friable for the
moftpart. Craffitude o f parts is in thofe things which are terrene*, which, being more
grofs, do not quickly communicate their virtues unto liquids, and therefore the vir­
tues thereof are exerted in theftom ach, and feldom or everpafs unto the liv e r; and
N o. 2. B fuch
fuch have much matter, as in mixtures very terrene, or exquifite mixtures o f the
aqueous humidity and terrene, without much prevalency o f heat, fo for the m oft
part are auftere, acerb, fweet, bitter, fait, and few infipid. Rarity is in dry bodies ;
hardnefs in the dry and terrene. Clamminefs in m oift bodies: .brittlenefs in dry.
Heavinefs in thick bodies : anti lightnefs in the rarefied. Tenuity loofeneth and pe­
netrated) ; craflitude obftruCts j foftnefs lenifies and conglutinates j and hardnefs
refifteth and dryeth up.
II. A ccording to their accidents, they may be taken notice of, as medicamentous
and alimentary, i. A s medicamentous, and fo according to their immediate and
more remote accidents. 2. A ccording to their more immediate, i. e. the qualities,
and way o f finding them out.
T h e Pototetology, or qualities, firft, fecond, third, and fourth. T h e firft are,
Calidity, or heat, which caufcth motion, and difpofeth the parts by a right con­
junction and fituacion thereof. It heateth, fubtilizeth, digefteth, openeth, mutura-
teth, andrarifieth, and caufeth agility : if exceflive, it doth notafeend, inflame, attract,
or difturb, as thapfta, & c . 2. Frigidity, or coldnefs, doth coo), conjoin, infpifiTace,
and hinderdigeftion, by the obtrufion o f calidity,and b y fhutting the paflages hinder-
eth dittribution : alfo, if exceflive, it fo filleth that it expels the ju ice, coagulates,
and congeals, as poil'on, & c . 3. H um idity, or m oifture, iso fea fy feparation, lenify-
ing and lu b rifyin g: if exceflive, it burdencth the fpirits and loadeth the fam e: and,
if aqueous, it caufeth naufeoufnefs, and fuffocatcs the excitation o f heat, caufeth fla­
tulencies, oppilations, flownefs o f aCtion, and debility o f motion, in all the p arts:
otherwife it lenities, lubrities, loofeneth, maketh the blood and fpirits more grofs, and
obtunds the acrimony o f humours, as m allows, See, 4. Siccity, or drinefs, doth
colligate and bind, and cauies a ftronger difpofition o f the body: if exceflive, it con-
ftringeth the paflages and hindereth the excretion, prefles forth thejuices out o f the
body, and caufcth tabefaCtion : if in the laft degree, it conlumeth moifture, caufeth
interception, fuffocation, and death, as crefles, Sec, H ere the degrees are four.
T h e ift fcarce fenfibly altereth the body. T h e 2d m anifeftly, yet without trouble
or hurt. T h e gd vehemently, but without corruption. T h e 4th moft: violently, and
with great hurt unto the body. In each o f which degrees there are three manfions
acting remifsly, intenfely, or in a m ean; or in the beginning, middle, or end, thereof.
T h e chemifts, inftead o f thefe four qualities or elements, fubftitute, t, their S al,
from which is all fapour or tafte, which is as it were the allies o f a body 5 for laic is a
dry
i C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D C O M P L E T E H E R B A L . 3
dry body, defending mixed bodies from putrefaction, o f excellent faculty to diffolve,
coagulate, cleanfe, and evacuate; from which arifeth all folidity o f body, denomi­
nations, taftes, and many other virtues analogous to the earth, as being firm, fixed,
and the fubjeCt o f the generation o f all bodies, and is therefore called by chemifts,
Sal, fal commune, acerbum & aware, corpus, materia, patiens, fixum, ars, feu/us materiale.
2. Sulphur, whence all odour or fmcli arifeth, and is like the flame ; or fulphur is
that fweec balfam, oily and vifeid, which preferves the natural heat o f the parts; the
inftrument o f all vegetation, accretion, and tranfmutation, and the original o f all
fmells, both pleafant and unpleafant: therefore it is compared to the fire, eafily re­
ceiving the flames, as all oily and refinous bodies d o : alfo it lenifieth and congluti-
nates or conjoineth contrary extremes, as Sal and M ercury, that being fixed and this
volatile, it participating o f both extremes, fo it tempereth the drinefs of Salt and
moifture o f M ercury as being vifeous; the denfity o f Salt and penetration o f M er­
cury by its remifs fluidity, and tire bitternefs o f Salt and acidity o f M ercury by its
fweetnefs ♦, therefore it is called, Sal Petre, duke, animaforma, agens>infiammabile, na-
Utra,judicium, fc?fpiriluale, by the chemifts. 3. M ercurius, whence is all colour, and
is reprefented by finoke or fume ♦,or M ercury is that acid liquor, permeable, penetra­
ble, etherious, and moft pure, from which arifeth all nourifbmenr, fenfc, m otion,,
ftrength, colour, and ratardation o f preproperantold age; 16 it is compared to the
element o f air and water : to the firft, as being turned into vapours by the vicinity
o f heat; and to this, as being hardly contained by its own term, but eafily in fome
ethers : or it is that efiential body, that by its aerca], moft lubtle, vivific, and fpi-
rituous, fubftance, is the pabulum o f life, and the proximate inftrument o f theeflence
or form , and is called by chemifts, Sal ammoniacum, acidum, Jpiritus, idea, infermans
out movens, vaporofttm> intclligcntia, intelletlus, gloriofum l A lfo M ercury containeth a
fulphureous and faline fubftance; Sulphur a l'alc and mercurial, and Salt an oleagi­
nous and m aterial; and the phlegm and caput mortuum are not principles, buc
their integuments, and without all H ippocratic virtu e; the firft being only moift,
the other dry and emplaftic. A lfo if M ercurial acid and (harp vapours abound,
there arifeth the epilepfy, apoplexy, palfy, and ail kinds o f catarrhs and defluxions,
and epidemic and contagious difeafes if venomous. Sulphur, if abounding, caufeth
inflammations and fevers, and the narcotica foporiferous difeafes. Salt exuperanc
caufeth corrcftons, ulcers, neat o f urine if difTolved, and tumours if coagulated.
Thereto belongs T artar, caufing the ftone, gout, & c .
T h e fecond qualities a: e, 1. T h e m ala&ic or m ollifying, to which the ecquetic
or fuppurating hath affinity; for both have an equal and lymmetric heat, and a
correfpondeut ficcicy, yet uiflfcring in mode. T h e fuppurating doth produce heat
1 moft
4
m oft like unto that o f the body, without any confumption or addition o f humidify.*
T h e em ollient afcends heat a little beyond the proportion o f nature, and contracts a
little hum idity, wherefore that rather 0|jerates by quantity than by the quality o f
heat, but the em ollient rather by quality. Therefore that which is exactly fuppura-
tory is emplaftic *
, yet fometimes emollition is the confequence o f hum idity, if joined
with moderate calidity or heat, and is uleful in fcirrhufTcs and tum ors; and, though
emollition may be by humtCtation and evacuation, yet it is properly by healing,
loofening, and callignation. Em ollients being moderately dry and hor, 20 or 30
in feirrhufles, and proportionably in ocher tumours. H ereto belongs the calaftic or
loofening; yet this is lefs hot and more moiftening than the em ollient, and o f a
thin fubftance. 2. Scleryntic or hardening, which properly is that which doth exfic-
cace without any excefs o f heat or cold ; for cold alfo may m ake obdurate, as aifo
too much heat, after another manner than only by exficcation, for, though that
which is dry is hard, yet all that is hard is not dry. B u t ficcity doth dry and indurate
two w ays; i. e. by alcering and m aking more dry the tflence o f the parts, which is
moft properly; or by con fuming the humours in the pores; yet fometimes obduration
may alfo be caufcd by repletion or fulnefs ; and, fomc fay, by cold and drinefs.
3. Araiotic and rarefying, or diaphoretic and rcfolving, which are moderate­
ly hor, with tenuity o f parts, and very little rcficcant or drying, for exceflive
heat doth not rarefy but burn, and by aduftion doth condenfate and dry. B ut m o­
derate heat openeth the paflages, and deeply penetratech by the tenuity o f its fub-
ftance, and eafeth pain; alio ic openeth the pores and attenuates the fubftance. T h e
proper diaphoretics are hot, dry, and o f thin parts, attenuant, m ollifying, and dif-
culling wind ; and the rarefacient moderately hot, like our own heat, moiftening
and o f thin parts. 4. Pycnotic or condenfating, contrary to the rarefacienr, con­
tracting the pores, and incraflating what is rarefied and humid, and m aking ic more
folid, which is in thofe things which refrigerate, yet are not terrene, oraerious, but
aqueous, and are not at all or but little aftringent; for thele do weaxly contract
and bind, i. e. by rcafon o f their foftnefs. 5. Anaftom otic or aperient, opening
the mouths o f the veflels, and is in thofe tilings that are o f grofs parts, hot be­
yond the firft degree, fharp, and biting. 6. Stegnocic or binding, contracting
occluding, and conftringing ; (hurting the mouths o f the veflels, and reftraining
fenfible excretion; and is, in thofe things which are frigid, o f grofs parts, and without:
acrimony, as many terrene bodies are: for thofe things, which ought ftrongly to
conftipate and bind, m oft alfo have a more ftrong and renitenc facu lty; yet fome
binders are hor and dry, and o f thick fubftance-, and others glutinous. 7. H elc-
tic, epifpaftic or drawing, attracting the humours from the center, and is in thofe
things which arc hot and o f thin parts: for that which is hot attra&eth, and that
more
C U L P E P E R ’S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D C O M P L E T E H E R B A L ; 5
more ftrongly which hath a conjunct tenuity o f parts; but thofe moderately attract
which are hot and dry in the fecond degree; if in the third, more efte&oaHy ; and
chiefly thofe that are fo in the fourth : for the attra&ion is according to the degree
o f hear, and is either more natural, or by putrefaction. Y e t fome things attract
fpecifically, and not by a manifeft qu ality: as things that are cathartic or purg-
ing, and alexitery or refilling poifon. 8. Apocrouftic or repercutienr, repelling
the humours flowing from the center, as in thofe things which are frigid and o f
grofs parts. F or that which is cold repelleih, and, if it hath a craflitude o f parts
alfo, it is more violent, as that which is acerbe or auftere; yet thofe things alfo
repel which are aftringent, efpecially thofe which are helped by the tenuity o f
their parts: for the thinnefs o f the fubflance doth m uch conduce to aftriCtion;
therefore other things that are aftri&ive, by reafon o f the craflitude o f their fub­
ftance, cannot eafily penetrate the more remote parts, precluding the paflages. Here­
to may the defenflve and the intercipient be reduced, being cold, aftringent, and re-
pulftvc. $. R yptic, abftergent clcanfing, or rem oving glutinous and clammy hu­
mours in the fuperfleies, or adhering to the pores o f the Ikin, or ulcers, and is in thole
things which have power to exliccate with tenuity o f fubftance; neither is it o f any
great moment whether they are hot or cold, by reafon that neither quality hinders
aCtion, except exceflive; yet fome count them hot chiefly, and dry, with a certain
thicknefs o f parts to vellscate the humours. 10. Eccathartic, ecphraCtic, and ex­
purgatory, or removing obftruCtions; not only opening the pores o f the ikin, but
the inferior duQus o f the bow els; as in thofe things that are nitrous and bitter, al­
though they have fome fmall aftriCtion, and by reafon o f fubftance do not differ from
thofe that are abftcrfivc, but in degree; for thofe things that cleanfe the pores and in­
ward paflages have a great tenuity o f parts, and are moderately hoc; as thofe things
which are nitrous and b itter: but thofe things, which, being outwardly applied to
the Ikin, do cleanfe the Ikin and ulcers from their excrements, are deftitute o f the
♦ aftriftive facu lty; but being taken inwardly, although having a certain aftriCtion,
yet neverthelefs they may purge, and cleanfe the greater paflages, and withal ftrength-
en the fame. A lfo fome things lenify or purge by iubrifying, as fat things; by walk­
ing and abfterflon, as whey and beets ; by compreflion, as quinces; by extinaula-
tion, as things hot, (harp, fair, and o f thin parts; and others cleCtively and properly.
A nd emetics caufe vomit by relaxation and fttmulation, the mouth o f the Itomach
being w eak; if the lower part, ufe deje&ories. n . Leptyntic or attenuating and
making thin, as in all thofe things that are expurgatory, hot, and o f thin parts: ex­
tenuating grofs and tough hum ours; and are for the m od part hot and dry, 2d or
^d, as things iharp and arom atical; yet fome are cold, as lemons, & c. but o f thin
parts. Hereto belongs the temetic, or inciding againft vifeid humours, which are
N o . 2. C more
6
more ftrong. A nd ditfolvers o f grumous matter, and coagulated 5 as alfo extentr-
a n cso ffa t, hot and dry, 3d, and o f thin parts : and the charaftic or laxants, m o­
derately hot, moift, and thin. 12. Em plaftic, vifcid, or clam m y, contrary to the
abfterfive ; for, heing applied, it doth tenacioufly inhere in the pores o f the fkin, fill
and obftruft the fame, as in thofe things that are fat and glutinous; as alfo terrene,
wanting acrimony and afperity, or roughnefs. H ereto may be referred the epice-
raftic or levigating, helping afperity by being em plaftic or moderately moift.
A n d the emplaftics are temperate, without evident heat, cold, or acrim ony: fom e
alfo have a thick terrene eflence or confidence, drying without b itin g; and others
aqueous or aereal, and lo are tenacious. 13. Em phra& ic or obftru& ing, pachyntic
or thickening, which are the fam e: for, as thofe things which are detergent and
purging do free the pores and paflages from obftruftion, fo thefe obftruft and fill
the fam , and make the humours o f the body tough and thick j and are cold, or
temperate, without any acrimony, and of a thick terrene fubftance. 14.. Anodyne,
paregoric, or eafing pain, as in thofe things which have thin parts, and are mode­
rately hot, not much exceeding the temperate, i. e. being hot in the firft degree, and
rarefacient; fo evacuating, digefting, rarefying, extenuating, concofling, and equa­
lizing, whatfoever hum our, either fharp, tough, or grofs, is inhering in the fmaller
pores, or grieved parts : and all vaporous crai's, grofs or cold fpirits, not finding
way o f evacuation; and are moiftening, aqueous or aereal, o f thin fubftance, and
not aftringent. 15. N arotic, or ftupifying the parts by its coldnefs, and not pro­
perly m itigating the pain, nor taking away the caufes o f the g rie f; yet ftupor is
fomewhat lefs than infenfibilicy, or the privation o f fenfe: the fame alfo is hypno­
tic, or fomnific, and caufeth deep, being taken, i. e. its fubjeft, which doth vehe­
mently refrigerate, i. e. in the 4th degree; fo that it doth not only ftupify the fenfe,
but, being liberally taken, caufeth death, as opium, and that not only by its exu-
perant quality, but alio by a certain propriety o f fubftance and its concurring eflence,
its narcotic vehemency being but little reprefled by the mixture o f hot correctors,
though it hath fome bitter parts. 16. A m yttic, metafyncritic, or rubefacient, cauf-
ing rednefs, contrary to the former, caufing pain, as in thofe things which heat and
diffolve unity ; o f this kind alfo are efcharotics, caufing crufts, which are hotter,
cauftic or bu rn in g; not only hot and dry in the fourth degree, but alfo o f a grofs
confidence, therefore, being fixed in any part, excruciate and torment the fame
by their ftiflhefs : like unto thefe are thofe things that are fcptic or corrofive, which
are vehemently hot and d ry, but o f thin parts and confidence; which therefore,
with a little pain and biting, or elfe without any fenfe o f pain, eliquate the part, and
are called alfo putrtfaClives: hereto alfo belong the pfilothra, extirpating the hair ;
and veficatories, very hot, and o f thin parts.

T h e
A N D C O M P L E T E H E R B A L 7
T h e third qualities arife from the mixture o f the firft and fecond, and are, r. T h e
Ecpuetic or fuppurating, turning into matter contufed flelh and humours remain-
ingin fwellings, as in thofe things which are moderately hot, and next unto em ol­
lients, yet differing in this, that they have alfo an em plaflic faculty, obftruCting
the pores, increafing the fubftance o f heat, and not intending the quality *
, and are
alfo called peptics or maturatives. 2. Sarcotic or generating fiefh, as in thofe
things which produce flefti in hollow ulcers, and fill the cavities, and are hot in the
firft degree, a little deterfive, and that without biting and aftriCtion. A lfo mode­
rately drying, viz. under the fecond degree. A nd fuch as impinguate, or make far,
are heating, nourilhing, im pulfive, attractive, retentive, or fpecific ; as the feed o f
hemp, kernel o f the Indian nut, and powder o f charcoal. 3. Colletic or conglu-
tinating, as in thofe things which dry in the fecond degree, and are in a mean as to
thofe which generate fiefh, and cicatrize; they are not abfterfive, butaftringent, and
prohibit the flux o f humours to the lips o f wounds, ulcers, and fiftulas; they are
alfo called fymphytics, traumatics, and enaima ; and are temperate, and o f a
thick fubftance, ftronger or weaker according to the perfbn or part. 4. Epulotic
or cicatrizing, as in thofe which greatly dry and bind without biting, drinking
the humidity o f the flefh, and contracting the fame, and covering with a thin callus­
like unto the fkin ; therefore do more dry than incarnatives or glucinatives, for they
bind, contract, conftipate, and indurate; and are o f thick fubftance, and cold : there
is alfo a (harp and biting epulotic that confumes dead fiefh, called cathairecic,
and a third drying without aftriCtion. 5. Porotic or generating callus, by which
broken bones are ferruminated and knit, and is neither bone nor fiefh, but betwixt
both, being a hard, dry, white, body 5 to the generation o f which are required a.
convenient diet, and medicines applied which are emplaftic and moderately hot,
drying, thickening, hardening, and binding. 6. D iuretic or provoking urine, as,,
i. In thofe things that are moift and liquid, and o f a thin confiftence, andeafy pe­
netration, encreafing the quantity o f urine ; fo operate by accident. 2. Jn thofe
things which purge and attenuate, and open the paffages, fome o f which are cold,
and o f thin parts ; fometimes expelling what fticks in the paffages : which operate
after a middle way, fometimes by accident, tempering exuperant heat which feiz-
eth on the veins and refolvech the ferous humidity, that the humours may be more
eafily attracted by the reins, and defeend by the bladder. 3. In thofe things which
purge the pafTages, and open the fame, extenuate grofs humours and the blood,
and feparate what is extenuated from the more grofs parts : which the reins then
eafily attraCfc and fend away by the urinary paffages ; which kinds o f diuretics arc
very hot and dry, to wit, in the third degree, fharp, and o f a very, thin fubftance,
coaCtive
8
corttive and feparating. 7. Lithrontripcic or breaking the done, diflblving and ex­
pelling the gravel, a* in thofe things which are diuretic, hot, dry, and o f thin
pasts; (harp, but more rcmifsly, and fomewhat bitter. A lio fome do it by in-
cifion and deterflon, without much heat; fome by afperity •, and others by o c ­
cult property. 8. Em m cnonagogic, or drawing out the terms, as in thofe things
which are hot and o f thin parts, that they may concoCt and digeft crude humours,
extenuate and incide thegrofs and rough, and remove obftruCtions by clcanfing
the paflages : fuch as are all proper diuretics: which alfo promote the e x ­
purgation o f the menfes ; and, if they are alfo (linking or bitter, they are more
effectual : (linking things deprefTmg the wom b, and the bitter being purging.
There are alfo accidental hyfterics; as thofe which are analeptic, or (le n g th ­
ening after extenuation ; or which refrigerate and hum eft the body dried by too
m uch heat : to thefe alfo have affinity thofe things which expel the fecundine
and dead-birth; efpecialJy thofe wh ch are more drong, i. e. hot and o f thin parts,
(linking and bitter with acrimony, efpecially if taken in a great quantity and
often. T h e proper are hot 2° or 3*, and dry 1* or 20, o f meanly grofs fub-
ftance, and bitter with acrim ony: the contrary are the aftringents. 9. Bcchic,
or helping the cough, as in thofe things which caufe or flop the (ame : for
thofe things which conduce much to the expectoration o f grofs humours do alio
caufe coughing ; but, on the contrary, thofe things which much incraflatc thin hu­
mours flop and eafe it : but thofe things are hot and o f very thin parts, and extenu­
ating, which expectorate tough hum ours; yet there are other things which in fom e
meafure purge the bread-, not much hot, nor very dry, but only a little moiftening,
or at lead lenifying what is exafpereted ; yet all diuretics o f the middle kind alfo >
are agreeable to the bread and lu n g s; which, if they are cold, incraflate the thin
humours and flop coughing, efpecially thofe kinds that are narcotic, or ftupif>ing.
10. Galattogenetic, or generating m ilk, as partly in meats, partly in medicines :
as for meat, it is fuch as is euchym ic and polytrophic, or o f good ju ice and o f
much nourifhment, and a little hotter and drier i f the blood be cold and pi-
tu ito u s; but more moift and lefs hot if troubled with choler. Medicaments
caufing m ilk are o f thin parts and hot, and o f affinity to thofe things which pro­
perly provoke urine, yet m od gentle; but thofe things which are more drong,
and provoke the courfes, hinder the generation thereof by too much eliquation
o f the humours. A lfo things too cold, thickening, digeding, or drying, hinder
the fame. 11. Spermatogenetic, or generating fperm, as in thofe things which
are hor, and not very dry, but flatulent, as alfo aliment o f good juice, and what-
foever increafeth the quantity o f blood. A lfo it is dimulated by things that are
ffiarp, and hindered by things very cold and difeutient. 12. H ydrotic or pro-
1 yoking
C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
A N D C O M P L E T E H E R B A L . 3
yoking fweat, as in things o f thin parts, and h o t *
, yet fome arc aflringenc and
cold, w orking occultly. A lfo the cofm etic, for the (kin, is extenuating, lax­
ative, emollient, cleanfing, and difeufling; for the teeth, ch a ding and binding ;
for the hair, healing, drying, and binding *
, for feurf, cleanfing and dilcufling.
N ote, as for the pharmic or fternutatory quality, it is in thole things that are
acrimonious, caufing an irruption o f the expulhve faculty ; as errhines, that are
hot, nitrous, exterfive, and (harp; as white pepper, hellebore, ginger, pellitory
o f Spain, caftor, cloves, fneefe-wort, and euphorbium finely powdered. A lfo the
apophlcgmatic is in things hoc and acrimonious ; yet fonietimes do it occultly,
as in maftic, raifins, nyfiop, organy, marjoram, pellitory o f Spain, ginger, white and
black pepper, and muftard-leed. T h e fcolerobrotic is in things bitter and (harp,
& c. as wormwood, coraline, & c .
T h e fourth qualities are fuch as follow the fubftance or property o f the
efience, and are found ou t only by experience; and are therefore called occult,

learned authors, is fignature. T h e poiotichnology, or way o f finding out thefe
qualities, is by manifeft reafon. i. B y ofm ellogy, or odour or fmell, which is
either fweet, familiar unto the fpirits o f the brain, and a fign o f hear, or (linking
and offenfive, cold and m oift ; the firft is in hot bodies, o f thin parts, among which
there is difference according to the degrees thereof; but thofe things which are
without odour are o f a g ro fs efience and humid, as thofe things which are fait
and auftere; alfo fuch things as are o f a mordicant and bitter fmell are hot,
but thofe that fmell like vinegar and acerb are cold, for in fome things the fenfe
o f odours is like that o f fapors, yet not o f fo fafe conjecture, by reafon o f the
inequality o f fubftance; fo r moft bodies are o f an unlike confidence, o f each o f
which parts odour (heweth not the temper, but where there are tenuous efflu­
viums or vapours, whereof the fweet ftrengthen the heart, the rank excite the
animal fpirits, the (linking help the fuffocation o f the m atrix. 2. By chroma.ology,
or colour, which is either, 1. L ucid, exciting the animal fpirits, and drawing them
outwards, as the white. 2. O rtenebrofe, calling them inwards, and caufing deep,
as the black. 3. Y ellow , helping the jaundice. 4. Green, ufeful for the e y e s:

I. A c t i v e . 1. Bitter, worm wood-like, gallifh, faline, or aloetic, which is
contrary to the nature o f living creatures, the tafte w hereof doth vellicate the
tongue. It confifteth o f terrene com buft parts, o f w hich, fome are more fubtile :
others, more grofs and terrene, exficcated by cxuper2nt hear, or coagulated by
cold, as appears in opium and aloes. It is not nutritive, it opcneih the m ouths
o f the veins, caufeth hemorrages, and thirft, and makes the blood fluxible : icac-
tenuateth, incideth, biteth, exafperateth, cleanfeth, melteth, attraifleth, \et more
moderately dricth and heateth ; it confumeth and refifteth putrefaction, drinking
up fupervacaneous humours, and refilling fweetnefs : it is hot and dry in the le-
cond degree, terra tifta. 2. Sharp, aromatical, biting, feptic or arfenical, hor,
dry and burning, pricking the tongue, and biting the mouth *
, it confifteth o f thin,
dry, and hot, parts, as pepper, onions, & c . I f it be not vehement, and hot under
the third degree *
, taken inwardly it doth penetrate, open, and attenuate, thick hu­
mours : applied outw ardly, it rarefieth the fkin, and draweth forth humours :
if it be hot above the third degree, it troubleth the head with thin vap ou rs: if it
be o f a more grofs eflencc, it is cauftic, and caufcth blifters and fcabs : and, if it
be o f an adverfe fubflance, it is feptic and deadly : alfo it is o f quick operation,
and

and ftron g; it attra&cth from remote parts, it feparates, corrodes, incidcth, heat-
eth, burneth, and inflametn; it refolveth, difcufleth, excoriateth, exulcerateth, and
ftrongly mciieth to expurgation j if o f more thin parts, it is diureticalj if o f
thicker, cau ftic: it is more intenfc in drier bodies, and more remifs where
there is an aqueous humidity. It is hot and dry, exaqua fs* terra attenmta. 3. A cid ,
or ammoniacal. It penetrateth the tongue with its tenuity, yet without any ma-
nifeit heat. It confilteih o f tenuous, cold, and dry, parts, as vinegar, the ju ice
o f lemons, dec. It penetrateth and incidcth no lefs than the iliarp fapor,
therefore it incideth, attenuateth,. biceth, detergeth, relei atesobftru&ions, repelleth,
and drieth: and, by reafon o f its penetrating coldnefs, it repels all fluxions •, and
by its flccity flops all eruptions o f blood. A lfo it helps naufeoufnefs, corrodes
and condenfates without h eat: it exalperates and refifts putrefaction. It is o f
doubtful qualities, fiery and aqueous, hot and cold, and o f all contraries. It is
cold and dry in the fecond degree, aqua ignita cum balitu terreo. 4. N itrous, which
is in a mean between fait and bitter; yet weaker than this, and more intenle than the
o th er: it is biting and corroding, as nitre. It openeth the belly, and purged*
the reins, ttrra Jpiritibus compulfa. 5. Salt, or ferous. It corrodeth the tongue
by exOccation, yet heateth not m u ch : it confifteth in a mean matter with heat
and drinefs, and is generated o f that which is terrene and dry, attenuate and
preaflate by heat with an aqueous humidity, fo not altogether terrene, as fa it;
therefore it contratteth the pores, inciticth, detergeth, digefteth, and drinketh up
humidity, by its drinefs, without any manifefl fenfe o f hear, and fo refifts putre­
faction. It openeth, bitech, txafperaceth, abftergeth, cleanfeth, troubleth, pro-
voketh to expulfion, purgeth, fubverteth, the ftomach, caufeth thirft, drieth, de-
cbftructeth, a gregateth, condenfeth, roborateth, and contraCleth. It is hoc and dry
io the fecond degree, and corrofive. 6. Sweet, far, honey-like, or faccharine. It
dilateth the tongue, and is plealant, having no exuperanc quality, and being in a
mediocrity, as fugar and honey, therefore it levigates what is exafjjerated, leni­
ties, maturates, concoCts, is anodyne, and only nourifheth ; alfo it digefts, rarefies,
diftributes, loofeth, fillcth the liver, ftoppeth the fplecn, and is hot and moift in
the firft degree, and o f terraqueous parts. 7. A cerb, aftri&ory, pontic, or alu­
minous. It contraCteth the tongue, and doth unequally exafperate the fame by
exficcation j it is near to the auftere, but more troublefomc to the tongue, aftrin-
gent, cold, and dry. T h e matter thereof is terrene and dry, without any manifeft
moifture, in which coldnefs is exaftly predominant with ficcity, as fervices:
therefore as cold it repelleth jluxions, as afiringent it ftoppeth the force o f hu­
mours-, as dry, it doth coarclate, condenfe, and cicatrize wounds y as terrene, it in-
crafTates
A N D C O M P L E T E H E R B A L . n

craflates humours, and condenfates the fuperficies •, it fhuts, corrugates, and in­
durates, fo the auftere. It refills poifon, and is cold and dry in the fecond de­
gree. 8. Auftere, ftvptic, aftringent, or vitriolate. It moderately bindeth the
tongue and m outh, coarttates the fame with a certain afpericy, and doth in fome
meafure refrigerate and dry. It confifts in a mean matter, participating o f that which
is terrene and watery, in which frigidity is predominant, as medlars and wild pears,
& c . It manifeftly refrigerateth, extinguifheth, bindeth, and contra&eth, mode­
rately ftops fluxions, and repelleth. It is fubacerb, lefs cold and dry, and exafperat-
ing, flopping, roborating, and indurating, terra fpiritu-cmmta, as vitriol. T h e
aftringent is weaker, as quinces. M at. M ed. ficc. craff.

that w hich is moift, aerious, and moderately hot, b y elaxation o f the watery part,
whereby it becomes moTe aerial, as oil. It is flow and weak in operation, flo p ­
ping the guftic or tailing organs. It doth humedt, lenify, and l'ofcen, loofen,
obftru ft, and caufe flatulencies and naufeoufnefs, having a certain obfeure and
remifs fweetnefs, and mean Jubilance. 2. H u n .ilen t: the matter thereof is grofs,
tough, aqueous, in which the earth, being well m ixed, caufeth corpulency * and
it is humid, little affetting thetafte, more grofs and crude than the fweet. It is
em plaftic, flopping the paffages, conglutinatis what is disjoined, lenifies what
is exafperated, and doth incraffate, as m ucilages, & c . M at. craff. frig, obfeure.
3. Acquinflpid. It is fcarce perceived by the tongue, hardly participating o f any
terrene flccity, and confifling in a crude ju ic e ; it is rather a privation than a fa-
p o r : its matter is fomewhat grofs, yet not altogether terrene, dry, or aftringent,
but moiftened with a certain hum idity, which alfo is not exquifltely mixed by
the activity o f heat, as water. It is emplaftic, flopping and obftru&ing, lenify-
ing what is exafperated, and conglutinating that which is disjoined: and, although
it hath fome affinity to fweet, yet it differeth in this, ihat it confifteth in a matter a
little more grofs and cru d e: it refrigerateth, and doth more moiften, i. e. from the
fecond to the third degree.I

H ere let it be remembered, that in all thefe the fympathy and antipathy o f the
flgns and planets are to be obferved ; both eflential, by houfe and exaltation, tem­
perature, or quality, or conditions ; or clfe accidental, by configurations ; o f which
fome are obnoxious and hateful, as a quartile and oppofition ; as alfo the conjunc­
tion o f bad planets: others are healthful, as a Textile and trine, and the conjunction
o f good planets. N ext confider what difeafes every planet caufeth diftinCtly o f
himfelf, and what under the figns o f the zodiac; what parts the planets gene­
rally rule, and what o f the figns they are under, and houfes o f the heaven in a ce-
leftial l'cheme; and what part each planet particularly rules, according to his tranfit
through each fign. T h en may the nature and kind o f the difeafe be found out by
the figure o f the decum biture. i. B y the houfes o f heaven; o f which, the fixth,
feventh, and twelfth, fignify difeafes. 2. B y the nature o f the figns; as fiery,
earthy, airy, and watery. 3. B y the planets, and their afpeCts. T h e part may be
found out by confidering the government o f the fign; and mafeuline planets fig­
nify the right fide, and the feminine the left, and afflict where ruling. A s for the
length o f thedifeafe, it may be found out bythe nature o f the planets, as follow eth;
Saturn caufeth long ficknefles; the Sun and Jupiter, fhort; M ars, ihorter, buc
acute; Venus, m ean; M ercury, inconflant, asafpe& ed; the M oon gives fuch as
often return. W hether it fhall end by life or death, well or ill, may be conjeftured
from afpeCts. T h e Sun giveth vital heat to the creation, the M oon giveth radical
moifture, Saturn fixeth and putrifieth this, Jupiter turneth it into nourifhment,
M ars calcines it, Venus makes it fruitful, and M ercury makes it rational. A s for
elements, the fire preferves the earth, that it be not drowned or deftroyed by a con­
tinual flux o f water upon i t ; the air preferves the fire, that it be not extinguifbed ;
the water preferves the earth, that it be not burned ; and the earth is the deCticon
o f all. T h e air and fire are thin and aCtive; water and earth, thick and paflive,
with a proportionable difference; or, as others fay, air hath motion, thinnefs, and
darknefs fire hath the tw o firft, and brightnefs; water hathmotion, darknefs, and
thicknefs, the earth hath the two laft, and quietnefs. A lfo the Sun is chief in chro­
nical difeafes; and the M oon in the acute with the afeendant. T h e occult qua­
lities are found out by peiralogy, or experience, which is more fure and fafe.

Xogy, or place o f gathering them *
, thus, i. Herbs are to be gathered in mountains,
hills, and plain places; in thofe that are higheft efpecially, and expofed to the fun
and winds; except fome few , as germander and ground pine, which are more odo­
riferous and frequent on h ills: but thofe that grow only in plain places are to be
gathered in more dry places, and more remote from lakes and rivers, except they
delight in more moifture, as water-caltrops, water-lilies, & c. 2. Flowers are to be
gathered in the fame places, in which there are the belt plants. 3. So fruits. 4. And
feeds. 5. So roots alfo. 6. W oods are to be taken from trees where they are well
grown. 7. Barks, where their plants are beft. 8. Juices are to be taken from the
beft herbs, chiefly the well grown and greater, as being lefs excremcntitious, and
that before they grow woody and rotten. 9. Liquors and gum s, & c. are to be
taken from mature Balks, which are the belt in their kind, as the reft. 2. T h e
chronology or time. T h u s, 1. H erbs are to be gathered in the time o f their llou-
rifliing, and beginning to g o to feed; which is for the m oft part in July, if they
are to be kept, and that at noon in a clear day, being fome confiderable time or
certain days before; freed from (bowers and not too dewy, or fcorchcd by coo
much heat o f the fun, which is chiefly in the fpring or beginning o f Cummer. But
thofe which grow green all the year in gardens may be gathered at any tim e; and
thofe that have neither ftalk, flower, nor feed, as maiden-hair, fpleenwort, & c. are
to be gathered in die vigour o f their leaves, i. e. when they are moft green and
greateft ; yet fome, becaufe while they flower or bear feed they are woody and dry,
are to be gathered before that time, as fuccory, beet, & c . 2. Flowers, in the vi­
gour o f their maturity, when opened (except the rofe) at noon in fair weather, after
the fun hath taken o ff the dew, and before they wither or fall off, which for the
moft part is in fpring. 3. Fruits, when they are ripe, and before they wither.
4. Seeds, out o f fruits thorough ripe, when they begin to be dry, and before they
fall o ff; and out o f plants when dry and are no longer green, as in the fummer,
i. e. June or July. 5. T he ju ice o f plants is to be preffed out whilft they are green,
and their leaves yet tender, and efpecially out o f the well grown and greater. 6. T h e
barks o f fruits are to be taken when the fruits are full ripe, and thofe o f roots when
the herbs have loft their leaves, but thofe o f trees when they are in their vigour.
7. W oods, when the trees are full grown. 8. Liquors and gum s, & c. are taken by
opening the ftalk in the vigour- thereof, and gums when congealed and mature.
9. Roots, when the fruit is fallen off, and the leaves alfo begin, which for the moft
part is in autumn, and are to be digged up in fair w eather; which is neceffary al-
N o. 3. X ways

ways to be obferved: as alfo (according to fome) the decreafing o f the moon, the
day o f decreafing, and the morning, that time being balfam ica!: as alfo the for*
titude o f the planet, fam iliar to the thing to be gathered, and the fign o f the zo ­
diac. 3. T h e dropology, or manner o f gathering them ; as fome affirm, fome
plants having diverfe faculties, according to the diverfe manner o f gathering them ,
as upwards or dow nw ards; fo hellebore, the leaves drawing the humours upwards or
downwards accordingly : fo the root o f elder alfo, and the buds, which, being ga­
thered upwards, caufe vom iting, and purge if downwards: alfo fome obferve, the
feite o f the regent planers, as whether they are oriental or occidental, & c . 4. T h e
parafceuology, or manner o f preparing them for aftervation. T h u s, 1. Flow ers,
are kept for the moft part feparated from the ftalks and leaves. 2. H erbs or leaves,
if they are greater, and having more thick ftalks, they are kept apart from them ;
but, if more (lender, they are kept together, and fometimes with the flowers.
3. Fruits, as apples, Sec. are to be placed with their ftalks downwards, and laft
longer if laid on a heap o f barley. 4. R oots, fom e are kept whole, as thofe o f
birthwort, gentian, hermodadtils, fatyrion, & c . others are d iffered , as thofe o f
briony, elecampane, flower-de-luce, See. alfo fome have the woody matter taken
away, as thofe o f fennel, ftone-parfley, & c . 5. T h e phylacology, or way and
place o f keeping them *
, which in general ought to be pure, convenient, high, dry,
open, o f a north or fouth fituation, where they m ay not be burnt by the fun, or
mosftened by the w alls, & c . more particularly: as 1. Flow ers, are to be dried in
the fhade, anti then they (efpecially thofe o f good odour) are to be kept in teile
cafkets. 2. H erbs, are to be dried in the fhade, except thofe that have thicker
(talks, and moifter leaves, and lb fubjeCt to putrefaction, which m uft therefore be
dried by the more intenfe heat o f the fun, or fome other w a y; and when they are
well dried, they are to be kept in linen bags, or, which is better, in wooden caf­
kets, that they may be defended from duft. 3. Seeds, are to be kept in a dry
place, and in a wooden or glazed veffel, being wrapped up in papers, that they may
laft the longer, and without im purity. 4* Fruits, in boxes, panniers, or fcuttles.
5. G um s and dry rofios, in a dry place, and in wooden veflels, but the more liquid
in pitchers. 6. Barks, in wooden coffers, and a dry place. 7. R oots, in a dry air,
and the fmaller and more thin (whofe virtues may be eafily di/fipated by the heat o f
lire or the fun) are to be dried in thefhadowand wind, as thole o f parfley, fennel, & c .
but the more grofs by the fun or wind, as thofe o f briony, gentian, mandrake, and
rhubarb. 6. T h e m onelogy, or duration o f them. W here note, the time o f keep­
ing them muft not exceed that o f their duration, which is diverfe, according to the
gteacer or fmaller folidity o f the fubftance, by which they are more or lefs fubjeft to

difHpation. In particular; i. Vegetables: as, i. Flow ers may be kept (olong as
they retain their colour, knell, and tafte, which for the moft part is h alf a year;
therefore they are to be changed every year. N ote alfo, they are belt when frclheft.
2. H erbs may be kept longer, yet it is better to change them yearly. 3. Seeds, by
how much they are more hot, (harp, and aromatical, by fo much alfo are they more
durable, therefore may be kept two or three years; but thofe that are fmallcr and
colder mjift be changed every year, and muft be kept carefully, leaft they grow
mouldy. -.4. Fruits muft be changed every year; but the exotic, that have a harder
bark or (hell, See. may be kept two or three years. 5. G um s and rofins are more
durable. 4k Barks laft a year or more. 7. R oots, if they are little, (lender, and thin,
are changed every year*, as thofe o f aflarabecca, fperage, & c . but the greater,
and having a grofs fubftance, laft two or three years; as thofe o f birthwort, briony,
gentian, rhubarb, and hellebore, See.
T hus far we have confidered the faculties o f m edicinals; now follow thofe o f
aliments, which are fuch vegetables, & c . as nourifh and increafe the bodily fub­
ftance, by reftoring that which is deperdite, the body being ina perpetual decay, and
therefore wanting refection by meat and d rin k : and this, if it do not greatly afteft
the body by any other quality, is properly and (imply called aliment, and is in
fome meafure like unto the fubftance o f the body, into which it is to be converted,
but, if it change the body by any exuperant quality, it is not (imply aliment, but
medicamencous : fuch are thofe things which with fweetnefs have adjoined an acid,
acerb, bitter, or (harp, qual ity ; and from hence arifeth the difference o f aliments ;
which, 1. in refpeft o f fubftance are hard and fofc; heavy, vifeid, or lig h t; firm or
infirm ; eafily or hardly conco&ed or corrupted. In refpedt o f quality, they are
hot, cold, moift, or d ry ; fweec or b itter; four, fait, (harp, acid, acerb, orauftere;
of good or bad ju ic e ; Ample or m edicamentous; wholefome or unwholefome; belt
or w orft; o f which fome are, 1. Euchym ic, or o f good juice, fweet in tafte, plea-
fanttothe palate, and not o f any unpleafani fm ell; as alfo fat things, and fome o f
which are inftpid, as bread o f the beft wheat, See. 2. Cacochym ic, or o f evil juice,
which befides fweetnefs, have fome other quality mixed therewith, as lliarpnefs,
bitternefs, faltnefs, acerbity, and two much acidity *
, alfo all fetid things, o f an un-
pleafant fmell, and corrupted; as the oleraceous, (efpecially the wild J except let­
tuce and fuccorv, alfo cucumbers, corrupt corn, things growing in cenofe and dirty
places, as alfo thick, auftere, and acid ; beer made o f bad grain, & c. and fome o f

as pulfes, efpecially lentils, and cabbage. 3. O f grofs nourishment, as thofe things
which have a ftrong and hard fubftance, as bread baked under afhes, and whatfo-
cveris made o f meal without leaven; chcfnuts, acorns, frogftools, thick, fweet,
and black, wine and ale *
, alfo whatfoevcr is vilcid and glutinous, and are to be
(hunned by all that live at eafe, and ufe no exerdfe before meat 5 but thofe are
the belt for diet that are in a mean between incraflating and attenuating. 4. O f thin
ju ice, as things which are not tough or vifcid, and have not a ftrong fubftance, but
thin and friable, efpecially if joined with acrimony j as garlic, onions, leeks, hyflop,
organy, favory, bread o f wheat well fermented, and twice baked, bitter almonds,
peaches, and thin white wines*, thefe alfo open the paflages, clean away what is
vilcous, incide and extenuate what is grofs; but are to be fhunned by thofe who
are o f a choleric temperature ; the long ufe o f them caufing bilious and ferous e x ­
crem ents, yet are agreeable to thole whofe body and veins are full o f a crude, pitui-
tous, and m elancholic, juice. H ere note, an attenuating diet differech from a flender
one, the laft prefixing a mode in the quantity, and the other being fo called by rea-
fon o f the tenuity o f the alimentary ju ice. 5. Eupeptic, or o f eafy concoftion, as
things which have not a folid or firm fubftance, but either rare or eafily refoluble,
conco& td, or corrupted, as moft fruits and things oleraceous; but thefe, as they
are quickly and eafily conco&ed, fo alfo are they eafily altered and corrupted: for,
if taken into a ftomach whofe heat is fliarp, biting, and febriculou$,or into which
fome bilious humour doth flow, they are not turned into aliment, but fome evil
humour but thofe things that are not eafily concodted are alfo neither altered nor
corrupted. 6. Difpeptic, or o f hard conco&ion, as all things o f a folid fubftance
and thick ju ice j as unleavened bread, cabbage, dates, chefnuts, unri(>e fervices,
acorns,and acid wines. T hefe, if taken into a hot ftom ach, are fooner con-
cofled than if into a m ean: and, in a weak and cold one, they are either concotted
not at all, or very flowly.
A n experiment o f all thefe may be made by dcco&ion in water. F or the liquor,
if fweet, flieweth the thing to be o f g o o d ju icej if (hick, o f grofs ju ice, if thin, o f

O N S I D E R I N G diverfe fhires in this nation give divers names to one
and the fame herb, and that common name which it bears in one county
is not known in another; I fhall take the pains to let down all the names
that I know o f each herb. Pardon me for letting that name firft which is moft
common to m yfelf; belides amara-dulcis, fome call it morral, others bitter-fweer,
fome woody-nightfhade, and others felon-wort.
D escription. It grows up with woody (talks even to a man’s height, and fome-
times higher: the leaves fall o ff at the approach o f winter, and fpring out o f the fame
(talk again at fpring tim e; the branch is encompafied about with a whitilh bark,
and hath a pith in the m iddle o f i t ; the main branch brancheth itfelf out into ma­
ny fmall ones, with clafpers, laying hold on what is next to them, as vines d o ; it
bears many leaves, they grow in no order at all, or at leaftwife in no vulgar order;
the leaves are longilh, though lomewhat broad and pointed at the ends; many o f
them have two little leaves grow ing at the end o f their footftalk, fome o f them have
but one, and fome none; the leaves are o f a pale green colo u r; the Rowers are o f
a purple colour, or o f a perfedt blue, like to violets, and they (land many o f them
together in kn ots; the berries are green at the firft, but when they are ripe they are
very red; if you tafte them, you fhall find them ju ft as the crabs which we in SufTcx
call bitter-fweet, viz, fweet at firft, and bitter afterwards.
N o. 5. ‘ P P e a c e .
P lace. T h e y grow com m only almoft throughout E ngland, efpecially in moiffc
and fhady places.
I T im e. T h e leaves fhoot out about the latter end o f M arch *
, if the temperature
o f the air be ordinary, it fiowereth in Ju ly, and the feeds are/ipe foon after, ufuaUy
in the next month.
G overnmentand V irtue?. It is under the planet M ercury, and a notable
herb o f his alfo, if it be rightly gathered under his influence. It is excellent good
to remove witchcraft, both in men and b ead s; as alfo all fudden difeafes what-
foever. Being tied about the neck, it is one o f the moft admirable remedies for
the vertigo, ordizzinefs in the head, and that is the reafon (as T ragus faith) the
people in Germany com m only hang it about their cattle's neck when they fear any
fuchevil hath befallen them . Country people com m only ufe to take the berries o f
it, and, having bruifed them , they apply them to felons, and thereby foon rid their
fingers o f fuch troublefome guefts.
W e have now fhewn you the external ufe o f the herb *
, we (hall fpeak a word or
two o f the internal, and fo conclude. T a k e notice, that it is a mercurial herb, and
therefore o f very fubtle parts, as indeed all mercurial plants are ; therefore take a
pound o f the wood and leaves together, bruife the w ood, (which you may eafily
do, for it is not fo hard as oak,) then put it in a pot, and put to it three pints o f
white wine, put on the pot-lid, and fhut it clofe, then let it infufe hot over
a gentle fire twelve hours, then ftrain it o u t; fo you havea moft excellent drink
to open obftruftions o f the liver and fpleen, to help difficulty o f breath, bruifes, and
falls, and congealed blood in any part o f the body, to help the yellow jaundice,
the dropfy, and black jaundice, and to deanfe women newly brought to bed. Y o u
may drink a quarter o f a pint o f the infufion every m orning; it purgeth the body ve­
ry gently, and not churlifhly as feme hold. A n d , when you find good by this, re­
member me.

I T is called alheal, H ercules’s alheal, and H ercules’s w oundw ort; becaufe it is
fuppofed that Hercules learned the virtues o f this herb from Chiron, when he learn­
ed p h yfico f h im : fom ecall it panay,and others opopanawort.
D e s c r i p t i o n . Its root is long, thick, and exceeding full o f ju ice, o f a hot and
biting tafte; the leaves are great and large, and winged almoft like afh-tree leaves,
but that they are fom ewhat hairy, each leaf confiding o f five or fix pair o f fuc-h
wings fet one againft the other, upon footftalks, broad below, but narrow toward

mouth. From among thofe rifeth up a (talk, green in colour, round in form, great
and ftrong in magnitude, five or fix feet high in altitude, with many joints and
fome leaves thereat j towards the top come forth umbels o f fmall yellow flowers,
after which are patted away, you may find whitifh, yellow , (horc, flat, feeds, bitter
alfo in tafte.
P l a c e . H aving given you the defcription o f the herb from the bottom to the
top, give me leave to tell you that there are other herbs called by this nam e; but,
becaufe they are ftrangers in England, I gave only the defcription o f this which is
eafy to be had in the gardens o f divers.
T i m e . A lthough Gerrard faith, that they flower from the beginning o f M ay
to the end o f December, experience teacheth them that keep it in theirgardens, that
it flowers not till the latter end o f the fummer, and iheds its feeds prefently after.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . It is under the dominion o f Mars*, hot, biting,
and choleric *
, and remedies what evils M ars afflicts the body o f man with by fym-
pathy, as viper’s fletti attracts poifon, and the loadftone iron. It kills the worms,
helps the gout, cramp, and convulfions •, provokes urine, and helps all joint-achs-,
it helps all cold griefs o f the head; the vertigo, falling ficknefs, and lethargy; the
wind cholic, obftruttions o f the liver and fpleen, ftone in the kidnies and bladder.
It provokes the terms, expels the dead b irth ; it is excellent good for the grief o f
the finews, itch, fores, and tooth-ach; the biting of mad dogs andvenomous beafts i
and purgeth choler very gently.

B E S ID E S the common name, it is called orchanet and Spanifh buglofs, and, by
apothecaries, anchufa.
D escription. O f the many forts of this herb, there is but one to grow com­
monly in this nation, of which one take this defcription: it hath a great and thick
root of a reddifh colour, long, narrow, and hairy leaves, green like the leaves o f
buglofs, which lie very thick upon the ground, and the (talks rife up compafled
about thick with leaves, which are lefs and narrower than the former; they are ten­
der and (lender; the flowers are hollow, fmall, and o f a reddifh purple colour; the
feed is greyifh.
Place. It grows in K ent near Rochefter, and in many places in the weft coun­
try, both in Devonfhire and Cornwall.

T ime. T h ey flower in July and the beginning o f A u gu ft, and the feed is ripe
foon after, but the root is in its prime, as carrots and parfnips are, before the herb
runs up to ftalk.
G overnment a n d V irtues. It is an herb under the dominion o f Venus, and
indeed one o f her darlings, though fomewhat hard to come by. It helps old ulcers,
hot inflammations, burnings by common Are, and Sc. Anthony’s Are, by antipathy to
M a rs; for thefe ufes, your beft way is to make it into an ointment. A lfo if you
m ake a vinegar o f it, as you make vinegar o f rofes, it helps the morphew and le-
profy -, if you apply the herb to the privities, it draws forth the dead child ; it helps
the yellow jaundice, fpleen, and gravel in the kidnies. Diafcorides faith, it helps
fuch as are bitten by venomous beaft% whether it be taken inwardly or applied to
the w ound; nay, he faith further, if any one that hath newly eaten it do but fpit in
the mouth o f a ferpent, the ferpent inftantly dies. It ftays the flux o f the belly,
kills worms, helps the Acs o f the m other; its deco&ion made in wine, and drunk,
ftrengthens the back, and eafeih the pains thereof; it helps bruifes and falls, and is
as good a remedy to drive out the fmall pox and meafles as can be. A n ointm ent
made o f it is excellent for green wounds, pricks, or thrufts.

D escription. T H I S fmall herb hath but one leaf, which grows with the fta lk a
finger’s length above the ground, being fat, and o f a frefh green colour, broad like
the water plantane, but lefs, without any middle rib in it ; from the bottom o f which
leaf on the infide, rifeth up ordinarily one, fometimes two, or three, fmall /lender
ftalks, the upper half w hereof is fomewhat bigger, and dented with fmall round
dents o f a yellowifh green colour, like the tongue o f an adder or ferpent. T h e
root continues all the year.
P lace. It groweth in moift meadows, and fuch-like places.
T ime. It is to be found in A pril and M ay, for it quicklyperifhcth w ith a lit­
tle heat.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V irtues. It is an herb under the dominion o f th eM o o n in
Cancer, and therefore, if the weaknefs o f the retentive faculty be caufed by an^ vil
influence o f Saturn, in any part o f the body governed by the M oon, or'under the
dominion o f Cancer, this herb cures it by fym pathy. It cures thofe difeafes after
fpecified in any part o f the body under the influence o f Saturn by antipathy.
It is temperate in refpeft o f heat, but dry in the fecond degree. T h e ju ice o f the
leaves drunk with the di Allied water o f horfetail is a lingular remedy for all manner
o f wounds, in the breaft, bowels, or other parts o f the body, and is given with good

futcefsunto thofe who are troubled with calling, vom iting, or bleeding at the mouth
or note, or otherwiie downwards. T h e laid juice, given in the diftiUed water o f
oaken buds, is very good for women who have their ufual courfcs, or the whites,
flowing down too abundantly. It helps lore eyes. T h e leaves infilled or boiled in
oil omphacine, or unripe olives fet in the l'un for certain days, or the green leaves
fu/nciently boiled in the laid oil, will make an excellent green balfam, not only for
green and frclh wounds, but alfo for old and inveterate ulcers * efpecially if a little
fine clear turpentine be difiolved therein. It alfo ftayeth and reprefifeth all inflam­
mations that arife upon pains, by hurts or wounds, either taken inwardly or out­
wardly applied. For ruptures or burden bellies, take as m uch o f the powder o f the
dried leaves as will lie on a fixpence, o»* lefs, according to the age o f the party, in
two ounces o f horfe-tail, or oak-bud water, fweetened with fyrup o f quinces. Uie
it every morning for the fpace o f fifteen days. But, before you enter upon the ulc
o f this or any other medicine, the gu t, if it fall into the ferotum, muft be reduced by
a furgeon, and a trufs muft be worn to keep it u p ; alfo the party m ud avoid all
violent motions, and lie as much as may be in bed, or on a couch. Fabritius Hilda-

hairy, brown ftalk, two or three feet high, with fmaller leaves fet here and there
upon it; a: the top whereof grow many yellow flowers one above another in long
fpikes, after which come rough heads o f feeds hanging downwards, which will
cleave to and ftick upon garments, or any thing that fhall rub againft them. T h e
root is black, long, and fomewhat woody, abiding many years, and fhooting afrefli
every fpring; which root, though fmall, hath a reafonable good feent.
P lace. It grows upon banks, near the fides of hedges or rails.
T ime. It flowereth in Ju ly and A u gu ft, the feed being ripe ftiortly after.
G overnment and V irtues. It is moderately hot and moift, according to the
mature o f Jupiter. It is under Jupiter and the fign Cancer, and ftrengthens thofe
parts under that planet and fign, and removes difeafes in them by fympathy, and thofe
under Saturn, M ars, and M ercury, by antipathy, if they happen in any part o f
the body governed by Jupiter, or under the figns Cancer, Sagittarius, or Pifces,
and therefore muft needs be good for the gout, either ufed outwardly in an oil or

the latter end o f the book. It has however been recommended in dropfies and the
jaundice. Externally, it has indeedits ufe: I have feen very bad fore legs cured by
baching and fomenting them with a decottion o f this plant,
It is o f a cleanfing and cutting faculty, without any manifeft heat, moderately
dryingand binding. Itopenech and cleanleth the liver, helpeth the jaundice, and
is very beneficial to the bowels, healing all inward wounds, bruifes, hurts, and
other diftempers. T h e deco&ion o f the herb made with wine, and drunk, is good
againB the biting and fringing o f ferpents, and helps them that have foul, troubled,
or bloody, water, and caules them to make water clear and fpeedily. Italfo helpeth
the cholic, cleanfech the breaft, and rids away the cough. A draught o f the d e­
ception, taken warm before the fit, firft removes, and in time rids away, the tertian or
quartan agues. T h e leaves and feed, taken in wine, flay the blood y-flux; out-
wardly applied, being m ixed up with old fwine’s greafe, it helpeth old fores, cancers,
and inveterate ulcers j and draweth forth thorns, fplincers o f wood, nails, or any
other fuch things, gotten into the Belli. It helpeth co Brengthen the members that
be out o f jo in t; and, being broifed and applied, or the ju ice dropped in, it helpeth
foul and impoBhumed ears.
T h e diflilled water o f the herb is good to all the faiJ purpofes, either inwardly or
outwardly, but is a great deal weaker.
I cannot Band to give you a reafon in every herb why it cureth fuch difeafes, but,
if you plcafe to perufe my judgm ent in the herb worm wood, you fliall find it th ere;
and it will be well worth your while to confider it in every h erb ; you (hall find them
true through the book.

ny, only this belongs to the celeftial fign Cancer. It hcaleth and drieth, cutteth
and cleanfeth thick and tough humours o f the bread, and for this I hold it inferior
to but few herbs that grow ; it helps the cachexia, or evil difpofition o f the body;
thedropfy and yellow jaundice *
, it opens obftruttions o f the liver, and mollifies the
hardnefs o f the fpleen; being applied outwardly, it breaks impoflhumes >taken in­
wardly, it is an excellent remedy for the third-day ague ♦, it provokes urine and the
terms, it kills worms, and cleanfeth the body o f Iharp humours, which are the
caufe o f itch, fcabs, & c. T h e fmoke o f the herb, being burnt, drives away flies,

find icall the year long, except the year be extreme frofty. It is quick, fliarp, and
bitter, in tafte, and is thereby found to be hot and dry; a fingular herb for all in­
ward wounds, exolcerated lungs or other parts, either by itfelf, or boiled with other
the like herbs; and, being drunk, it in a fhort time ealeth all griping pains, windy
and choleric humours in the ftomach, fpleen, or belly ; helps theyellow jaundiceby
opening the (loppings o f the gall and liver, and m elancholy; by opening the (lop­

alfo the gout in the hands, knees, or fe e t; and, if you put to the decoflion fome ho­
ney, and a little burnt allum , it is excellent good to gargle any fore mouth orthroac,
and to wafh the fores and ulcers in the privy parts o f man or woman) it fpeedily
helpeth green wounds, being bruifed and bound thereto. T h e ju ice o f it, boiled
with a little honey and verdigreafe, doth wonderfully cleanfe fiflulas, ulcers*, and
ftayeth the fpreading or eating o f cancers and ulcers ; it helpeth the itch, fcabs,
wheals, and other breakings-out, in any part o f the body. T h e juice o f celandine,
field daifies, and ground ivy clarified, and a little fine fugar diftolved therein, and
dropped into the eyes, is a fovereign remedy for all the pains, rednefs, and watering,
o f them ; as alfo for the pin and web, fkins and film s growing over the fig h t; it
helpeth beads as well as men. T h e ju ice dropped into the ears doth wonderfully
help the noife and finging o f them, and helpeth the hearing which is decayed. It is
good to tun up with new drink, for it will fo clarify it in an igh t, that it will be fit­

G overnm ent and V irtues*. It is a tree o f Saturn. T h e inner bark hereof
purgeth downwards both choler and phlegm, and the watery humours o f fuch as

been taken before to avoid the groflfer excrem ents; it purgeth and ftrengtheneth
the liver and fpleen, deanfm g them from fuch evil humours and hardnefs as they

• That is, the a n g e lic a l ora n g e l- iik e k e r b . On what occafion this excellent name was firfl given unto it,
I.knownot; unlcfs it were for the excellent virtues thereof, or for that God made it known to man by the
minidry of an angel. I fuppofc the former cafe rather to be true : however, as I am not able to prove the
other, fo I think no mancan give any good reafon to thecontrary. For this we know, that God hath made
hisangels mmifteringfpirits, toferve us for the fafeguard of our fouls, and alfoof our. bodies. But, upon
what occafion foever the name was given, it is excellent, and fo are its properties.^^— Angelica is hot and
dry, at lead in the third degree. All the latter writers agree upon this, and experience proveth the fame, that
it is good againfl poifon, peftilent air, and the peftilencc itfclf. The practitioners of Germany write thus of
it: If any man befuddcnly taken either with thepeftilencc or with any peftilent ague, with too much fwcat*
ing, let himdrink of the ppwdcr of the root halfa drachm, mingled with a drachmof treacle, in threeor four
fpoonfuts of the.watcr of angelica, diftilkd from the roots \ and, after his going to bed, coveting himfclfwell,
lethim fait, at thelcaft, three hours after; which if he do, he will begin to fweat, and, by the helpof God,
he will be cured of his difeafe. Forwant of treacle one may take a whole drachm of the root of angelica in
powder, with fo much of the diltilled water as aforefaid, andit will have the fameeffcfcl.—-----The root of an­
gelica well lleeped in vinegar, andfmelt to intime of the peftilencc, and the fume Iiquorbeingfometitr.ee
drunk falling, preferveth from infection. But, in my judgment, it is better to take an oraogc or a lemon, cut
off the top, pick out the meat, prick it full of fmall holes, put into it a piece of fpongc, or fine linencloth,dip-
ped in the aforefaid vinegar, and fmcll to It. — The water diflillcd out of the roots of angelica, or the
powder of the fame, isgood again!! gnawing and pains of the belly occaftoned with cold, if the body be not
bound. It is good againf! all inwarddifeafes, as pleurify, in the beginning before the heat of the inflamma­
tion become into the body: for that it dilfolveth and fcattcreth abroad fuch humours asufc to caufc the plcu-
rify. Moreover it is good for the difeafes of the lungs, if they come of a cold caufej and from the rtranguri-
an, if froma cold caufe, or of a (lopping. It is good fora woman that is in travail. It cxpdleth wind thatis
inthe body, and eafeth the pain that cometh from the fame. The root may be foil in uinc or water, as the
nature of the Tick requireth. The root or the juice, put into an hollow- tooth, taketh away the uchj the fume
effeCthath the diflilled water, being put into the car. The juice and water of angelicaquickens the eye fight,
and breaks the little films thatcover the eyes, caufing darknefs of fight. Of the roots of angelica and pitch
may be made a good emplaifter againfl the biringsof mad beads. The water, thejuice, or the powder of this

G o v e r n m e n t an d V ir t u e s . It is an herb o f the fun in L eo •, let it be gathered
u hen he is there, the M oon applying to his good afpcdt; let it be gathered either in
his hour, or in the hour o f Jupiter, let Sol be angular. O bferve the like in g a ­
thering the herbs o f other planets, and you may happen to do wonders. In all epi­
demical difeafes caufed by Saturn, this is as good a prefervative as g ro w s; it refifts
poilon by defending and com forting the heart, blood, and fpirits; it doth the like
rlcanfc them, amt cover the bones with flefh. The water of the fame, in a cold caufe, is good to be laid on
places difeafed with the gout and fcintica. For it ftaunchcth the pain, and mcltcth away the tough humours
that are gathered together. The feed is of like virtue with the root. The wild angelica, that growethhere
in the low woods, and by the water fide, isnot of fuch virtue as theother; howbeit the furgeons feethe the
root of it in wine, to heal green wounds. Thefe properties I have gathered out of German writers. ! have
not asyet proved them all myfelf, but divers of them I have proved, and have foundthem to be true. I have
fet down the peel of an orange, or lemon $ the meat whereof is alfo commended by phyficians to be a good
prefervative both againft poifon, and the infection of pcftilcnce.--------Late writers affirm, that the roots of
angelica are oppofiteto all poifon and infection. If any beinfefted with the plague, or poifoned, they give
him immediately to drink a drachm of the powder of this root, with wine in the winter; and, in fummer,
with diftilled water of carduus bcncdi&us; then get him to bed, and cover him until he have fweat freely.
The fame root, beingtaken fading in themorning, or butheld inthe mouth, doth keepand preferve the body
from (he evil of the air. The leavesof angelica, poundedwith the leaves of rue and honey, are very good to
be laid to thebitingsof maddogs, prefently taken after the hurt, the wine being drunk wherein the root or
leavesofangelica hath been boiled.
To conclude, I have thought good to write on thefeherbs cardmisbenedi^tus and angelica, either becaufe
theyare not thoroughly known to many; or elfc that apothecarieswould have theirfecrct virtues concealed.
But 1 do not think it fit that any tiling fhould befecret which may be profitable to my country. For God
hath not made any thing for theufeof a few, but for thecommon ufcofall men. And we that are the chil­
dren of God, ought to frame ourfclvcs fo, that wc may be like affeftioned unto our Father who is beneficial
unto all men ; who hath made his fun to fiiinc and his rain to rain upon thewicked aswell asuponthe good;
that is to fay, who fcedethall, both good and bad; by heatandmoifhire, which proceed from the fun and the
rain, all things grow upon the earth, whereby our lives are maintained. I conclude, that, forafmuch as
Almighty God is good unto all men, we ought to be like minded, and not to keep fecretnorto hideany thing
that may profit oneanotlter*

at a time, eafeth all pains and torments com ing o f cold and wind, fo as the body be

it cools the womb being over heated : and let me tell you this, and I will tell you
but the truth, heat o f the womb is one o f the greatelt caufes o f hard labour in
childbirth. It makes barren women fruitful, it clcanfeth the womb if it be foul,
and
and ftrengihens it exceedingly; it provokes the terms if they be (topped, and flops

b u t purgeth downward, and by urine alfo, purging both choler and phlegm : if you
add to it fomc fpikenard with the whey o f goat's m ilk, or honeyed water, it is made
more ftrong, but it purgeth phlegm more manifeftly than choler, and therefore
doth much help pains in the hips and other parts. Being boiled in whey, it
wonderfully helpeth the-obitrudtions o f the liver and fpleen, and is therefore pro­
fitable for the dropfy and jaundice, being fteeped in wine and drunk. It helps
thofe continual agues that com e by the plenty o f ftubborn h u m o u r s a n oil made
thereof by fecting ic in the fun, with fome laudanum added to it, provoketh fweating,
the ridge o f the back being anointed therewith, and thereby drivethaway the {baking
fits o f the ague. Ic will not abide any long boiling, for ic lofeth its chief ftrength
thereby *
, nor much beating, for the finer powder doth provoke vomits and urine,
and the coarfer purgeth downwards. T h e common ufe hereof, is to take the juice o f
five or feven leaves in a little drink to caufc vom itings; the roots have alfo the fame
virtue, though they do not operate fo forcibly, yet they are very effectual againft
the biting o f ferpents, and therefore are put as an ingredient both into mithridate
and Venice treacle. T h e leaves and roots being boiled in lye, and the head often
walhed therewith while it is warm , comforteth the head and brain that is illaffe&cd
b y taking cold, and helpeth the memory*
I (hall defire ignorant people to forbear the ufe o f the leaves : the roots purge
more gently, and may prove beneficial in fuch as have cancers, or old putrified
ulcers, or fifiulas upon their bodies, to take a drachm o f them in powder in a quarter
o f a pint o f white wine in the morning. T h e truth is, I fancy purging and vomit­
in g medicines as little as any man breathing, for they weaken nature, nor (hall ever
advife them to be ufed unlels upon urgent neceffity. I f a phyfician be nature’s fer-
va~.t, it is his duty, to ftrengthen his miftrefs as much as he can, and weaken her as
little as may be.

does alfo Cryfippus, but Pliny and the Arabian phydcians defend it. For mine own
part, I prefently found that fpeech true, Non noftrmn inter nos tantas componere lites>
and away to Dr. Reafon went I, who told me It was an herb o f M ars, and under
the Scorpion, and perhaps therefore called bafilicon, and then no marvel if it carries
a kind o f virulent quality with it. Being applied to the place bitten by a venomous
bead, or ftung by a wafp or hornet, it fpeedily draws the poifon to it. E very like
draws its like. M izaldus affirms, that, if it be laid to rot in horfe-dung, it will
breed venomous bead s; and H ollerius, a French phyfician, affirms upon his own
knowledge, that an acquaintance o f his, by commonly fmelling to it, had a fcorpion
bred in his brain. Som ething is the matter, this herb and rue will not grow toge­
ther, no, nor near each o th er: and we know that rue is as great an enemy to poifon
as any that grows. T o conclude, it expelleth both birth and after-birth, and, as it
helps the deficiency o f Venus in one kind, fo it fpoils all her actions in another.

T H I S is fo well known that it needs no deferiptton 5 I fliall therefore only write
the virtues thereof, which are many.
G overnment a n d V irtues. I (hall but only add a word or two to what my
friend hath written, viz. that it is a tree o f the Sun, and under the celedial fign
L eo, and refideth witchcraft very potently, as alfo all the evils old Saturn can do
to the body of man, and they are not a few j for, it is the fpeech o f one, and I am
midaken if it were not M izaldus, that neither witch nor devil, thunder nor light­
ning, will hurt a man in the place where a bay-tree is. G alen faith, that the leaves
o r bark do dry and heal very m uch, and the berries more than the leaves. T h e
bark o f the root is lefs lharp and hot, but more bitter, and hath fome aftri&ion
withal, whereby it is effectual to break, the done, and good to open obftruCtions o f
the liver, fpleen, and other inward parts, which bring the dropfy, jaundice, & c.
T h e berries are very effectual againd the poifon o f venomous creatures, and the
dings o f wafps and bees, as alfo, againd the pedilence, or other infectious difeafes,
■ and therefore is put into fundry treacles for that purpofe: they likewife procure
women’s courfes; and feven o f them, given to a woman in fore travel o f child-birth,
do caufe a fpeedy delivery, and expel the after-birth, and therefore muft not be taken
but by fuch as have gone out their time, left they procure abortion, or caufe labour
too foon: they wonderfully help all cold and rheumatic didillations from the brain
to the eyes, lungs, or other parts; and, being made into an electuary with honey, do
help the confumption, old coughs, (hortnefs o f breath, and thin rheums 5 as alfo
the
the m egrim : they m ightily expel wind, and provoke urine; help the mother,
and kill worms: the leaves alfo w ork the like efFe&s. A bath o f the decoftion
o f the leaves and berries, is Angularly good for women to fit in, that are troubled
with the mother, or the difeafes thereof, or the Hoppings o f their courfes, or for the
difeafes o f the bladder, pains in the bowels by wind and flopping o f urine. A de-
cottion likewife o f equal parts o f bay-berries, cummin-feed, hyflop, origanum, and
euphorbium , with fome honey, and the head bathed therewith, doth wonderfully
help diflillations and rheums, and fettleth the palate o f the mouth into its place.
T h e oil made o f the berries is very com fortable in all cold griefs o£ the joints,
nerves, arteries, flom ach, belly, or wom b, and helpeth palfies, convulfions, cramps,
aches, trem bling, and numbnefs in every part, alfo wearinefs, and pains that com e by
fore travellings: all grief and pains likewife proceeding from wind, either in the
head, flom ach, back, belly, or wom b, by anointing the parts affefted therewith ;
and pains in the ears are alfo cured by dropping in fom e o f the oil, or by receiving
into the ears the warm fum e o f the decodlion of the berries through a funnel. T h e
oil takes away marks o f the (kin and flelh by bruifes, falls, & c . and diffolveth the
congealed blood in them : it helpeth alfo the itch, fcabs, and wheals in the fkin.

D escription. O F beets there are two forts, which are belt known generally, and
whereof I (ball principally treat at this time, viz. the white and red beets; and
their virtues.
T h e common white beet hath many great leaves next the ground, fomewhac large,
and o f a whitifh green colour; the ftalk is great, ftrong, and ribbed, bearing great
ftore o f leaves almoft to the very top o f i t : the flowers grow in very long tufts,
ftnaU at the ends, and turning down their heads, which are fmall, pale, greenifh,
yellow burs, giving cornered prickly feed. T h e root is great, long, and hard, and,
when it hath given feed, is o f no ufe at all.
T h e common red beet differcth not from the white, but only it is lefs, and the
leaves and the roots are fomewhat red : the leaves are differently red, in fome only
with red ftrakes or veins, fome o f a frefh red, and others o f a dark red. T h e root
hereof is red, fpungy, and not ufed to be eaten.
G overnment and V irtues. T h e government o f thefe two forts o f beets are
far different; the red beet being under Saturn, and the white under Jupiter; there­
fore take the virtues o f them apart, each by itfelf. T h e white beet doth much
loofen the belly, and is o f adeanfing digefting quality, and provoketh urine: the
juice o f it openeth obftru&ions both o f the liver and fpleen, and is good for the head
ach, and fwimmings therein, and turnings o f the brain> and is effectual alfo againft
all venomous creatures *
, and, applied to the temples, flayeth inflammations in the
eyes; it helpeth burnings being ufed without oil, and, with a little allum put to if,
is good for St. Anthony’s fire. Beet is hot and dry, and loofens the belly by realbn
o f its nitrofity. It is an errhine, efpecially the root; for the juice o f it received into
the noftrils occafions fneezing; the young plants, with their roots, gently boiled and
eaten with vinegar, procure an appetite, excinguifh third, and fupprefs choler in the
ftomach. Beet amongft the antients was much noticed for its infipid cafte. Mar­
tial reproaches it in the following diftich,
Ut fapiaat fatux fabrorum prandia Bets,
O quam fxpepetet vina piperque coquus ?
T h e juice o f this herb drawn up into.the noftrils powerfully evacuates phlegmatic
humoursfrom the brain,and cures inveterate head-achs. T his is counted a great fecrec
by fome. It is alfo good for all wheals, pufhes, blifters, and blains, in the fkin ; the
herb

in water and fome vinegar, healeth the itch, if bathed therewith, and cleanfeth the
head o f dandriff, fcurf, and dry fcabs, and doth m uch good for fretting and run­
ning fores, ulcers, and cankers, in the head, legs, or other parts, and is much com ­
mended againft baldnefs and fhedding o f hair.
T h e red beet is good to rtay the bloody flux, women’s courles, and the whites,
and to help the yellow jaundice. T h e ju ice o f the root put into the noftrils, purgeth
the head, helpeth the noife in the ears, and the tooth-ach; the ju ice fnuflfed up the
nofe helps a {linking breath, if the caufe lies in the nofe, as many times it doth, if
any bruife have been there ; as alfo want o f fmell com ing that way.

is appropriated more to wounds and hurts in the bread than wood betony, which
follow s. It is an excellent remedy for fick hogs. It is o f a clean in g quality ; the
leaves, bruifed and applied, are effectual for all cold and filthy ulcers; and efpecially
if the ju ice o f the leaves be boiled with a little honey, and then dipped therein, and
the fores drefled therewith: as alfo for bruifes or hurts, whether inward or outward.
T h e diftilled water o f the leaves is ufed for the fame purpofes *
, as alfo to bathe the
face or hands fpotted or blemifhed, or difcoloured by fun-burning. Pliny faith,

fpotted with white fpots both in the upper and lower p a rt: the feeds, being con­
tained within the husks that hold the (lowers, are blackilh, (omewhat long
and uneven. T h e roots are many white thready firings; the flalk perilheth, but
the root, with fome leaves thereon, abides all the winter. T h e whole plant is fome­
what fmall.
Place. It groweth frequently in woods, and delighteth in fhady places.
T i m e . A nd ic flowereth in July, after which the feed is quickly ripe, yet is in

G o v e r n m e n t and V irtues. T h is herb is appropriated to the planet Jupi­
ter, and under the fign Aries. Antonius M ufa, phyfician to the emperor A uguftus
Caifar, wrote a peculiar book on the virtues o f this herb j and, amongft other vir­
tues, faith o f it, that it preferveth the lives and bodies o f men from the danger o f
epidemical difeafes, and from witchcrafts alfo. It is found by daily experience to
be good for many difeafes s it helpeth thofe that loath, or cannot digeft, their meat,
thofe that have weak fiomachs, or lour belchings, or a continual rifing in their
ftomach, ufing it familiarly either green or d ry ; either theherb or root, or the
flowers, drunk in broth or meat, or made into conferve, fyrup, water, ele&uary,
or powder, as every one may bed frame thcmfelves unto, or as the time or feafon
requireth: taken any o f the aforefaid ways, it helpeth the jaundice, falling fick-
nefs, the palfy, convulfions, or Ihrinking o f thefinew sj the gout, and thofe that
are inclined to dropfies; and thofe that have continual pains in their head, although
it turns to phrenfy. T h e powder mixed with pure honey is no lefs available for all
forts o f coughs or colds, wheefing, or (hortnefs o f breath, diftillations o f thin
rheum upon the lungs, which caufctn confumptions. T h e decottion made with
N o. 7. Z mead
mead and a little pennyroyal is good for thofe that are troubled with putrid agues,
whether quotidian, tertian, or quartan, and to draw down and evacuate the blood
and humours that by falling into the eyes do hinder the fig h t: the decoftion
thereof made in wine, and taken, killeththe worms in the belly, openeth obftruc-
tions both o f the liver and fpleen, cureth ditches and pains in the back or fide, the
torments and griping pains o f the bowels, and the wind ch o lic; and mixed with
honey purgeth the belly, helpeth to bring down women’s courfcs, and is o f fpeciai
life for thole that are troubled with the falling down o f the mother, and pains there­
of, and caufcth an eafy and fpeedy delivery o f women in child-birth; it helpeth
alfo to break and expel the ftone either in the bladder or kidneys. T h e deception
with wine, gargled in the mouth, ealeth the tooth-ach; it is commended againft
the flinging or biting o f venomous fer[)ents or mad dogs, being ufed inwardly and
applied outwardly to the place. A drachm o f the powder o f betony, taken with a
little honey in lome vinegar, doth wonderfully rcfrefli thofe that are over-wearied
by tra v e l; it ftayeth bleeding at the m outh or nofe, and helpeth thofe that pifs or
fpic blood, and thofe that are burden or have a rupture, and is good for i'uch as
are bruifed by any fall ororherwife. T h e green herb bruifed, or the ju ice applied
to any inward hurt, or outward green wound in the head or body, w ill qu ickly
heal and clofe it u p ; as alfo any veins or finews that are c u t; and will draw forth
any broken bone or fplinter, thorn, or other thing, gotten into the flelh ; it is no lefs
profitable for old fores, or filthy ulcers, yea, though they be filtulous and hollow •
but fome do advife to put a little fait to this p urp ofe: being applied with a little
hog’s lard, it helpeth a plague-fore, and other boils and pufhes: the fumes o f the
decottion while it is warm , received by a funnel into the ears, eafeth the pains o f
them, deftroyeth the worms, and cureth the running fores in them ; the juice
dropped into them doth the feme. T h e root o f betony is difpleafing both to the
tafte and ftomach, whereas the leaves and flowers, by their fweet and fpicy tafte,
are com fortable both in meat and medicine.
T hefe are fome o f the many virtues Antonius M ufa appropriates to betony.
It is a very precious herb, that is certain, and very proper to be kept in a man’s
houfe, both in fyrup, confcrve, oil, ointment, and plafter. T h e flowers are ufualiy
conferved.

reddifh thread in the m iddle, which pafs into fmall round beriies,of the bignefsand
colour of juniper-berries, but o f a purple fweetifh fh arp tafte; the ju ice o f them
giveth a purplifh colour to their hands and lips that eat and handle them,efpecially
if they break them. T h e root groweth aflope under ground, (hooting forth in fun-
dry places as it creepeth: it lofeth its leaves in winter.
T h e red bilberry or whortle bufti rifeth up like the form er, having fundry harder
leaves, like the box-tree leaves, green and round pointed, ftanding on the feveral
branches \ at the tops whereof only, and not from the Tides as in the former, come
forth divers round flowers, o f a pale red colour, after which fucceed round, reddifh,
fappy, berries, which when ripe are o f a fharp tafte: the root runneth in the ground,
as in the former, but the leaves o f this abide all the winter.

the red grows in the northern parts o f this land, as Lancafliire, Derby (hire, Y o rk-

G overnment and V irtues. It belongs to Saturn, and is in operation cold
and dry. Both the leaves and roots have a powerful faculty to refift all poifon: the
root in powder taken in drink, expelleth the venom o f the plague, the fmall pox,
meafles, purples, or any other infectious difeafe, driving it out by fweating *
, the
decoction o f the root, being drunk in wine, ftayech all manner o f inward bleedings
or fpittings o f blood, and any fluxes in the body o f either man or woman, or vom it­

ulcers. T h e decoction o f the root in wine, being drunk, hindereth abortion or mif-
carriage in child-bearing. T h e leaves alfo kill the worms in children, and are a great
help for them that cannot keep their water *
, if the ju ice o f plantane be added thereto,
and outwardly applied, it m uch helpeth the gonorrhea, or running o f the reins. A
drachm o f the powder o f the root taken in the water thereof, wherein fomc red hot
iron or fteel hath been quenched, is alfo an admirable help thereto, fo as the body
be firft prepared and purged from the offenfive humours. T h e leaves, feed, or
roots, are all very good in deco&ions, drinks, or lotions, for inward or outward
wounds or other fores*, and the powder, ftrewed upon any cut or wound in a vefn,
ftayeth the immoderate bleeding thereof; the deco&ion o f the roots in water, where­
to lbme pomegranate peels and flowers are added, injected into the matrix, ftayeth
the accefs o f humours to the ulcers thereof, and bringeth it to its right place, being
fallen down, and ftayeth the immoderate flux o f the courfes. T h e root hereof with
pellitory o f Spain and burnt alium o f each a little quantity, beaten fmall and made

held between the teeth if there be no hollownefs in them , ftayeth the defluxion o f
rheum upon them, which caufcth pain, and helps tocleanfe the-head, and void
much offenfive water. T h e diftillcd water is very effeftual to wafh fores or cancers
in the nofe,orany other part, if the powder o f the root be applied thereunto after­
wards. It is good alfo to fallen the gum s, and to take away the heat and inflamma­
tions that happen in thejaw s, almonds o f the throat, or mouth, if the deco&ion o f
the leaves, roots, or feeds bruifed, or the ju ice o f them be applied ; but the roots

alfo profitable for the bloody flux and lafks, and a fit remedy for fpicting o f blood.
E ither the decodtion or powder o f the root, being taken, is good to break or drive
forth gravel, and the ftone in the reins and kidneys. T h e leaves and brambles, as

diftempers o f the body, head, eyes, and other parts, and fo r all the purpofes afore-
faid. T h e leaves boiled in lye, and the head wafhed therewith, heal the itch,
and the running fores thereof, and make the hair black. T h e powder o f the leaves
ftrewed on cancers and running ulcers, doth wonderfully help to heal them. Some

T o thcfe I may add a third fort, which is not fo common, nor yet fo well know n,
and therefore I fh allgive you its name and defcription.
N am e. It is called langue d e-beuf: but why they fliouldcall one herb by the name
o f buglofs, and another b y the name o f langue-de-beuf, is to me a queftion, feeing
one fignifies ox-tongue in G reek, and the other fignifies the fame in French.
D escription. T h e leaves thereof are fmaller than thofe o f buglofs, but m uch
rougher, the ftalk rifing up about a foot and a half high, and is moft com m only
o f a red co lo u r; the flowers Hand in fcaly rough heads, being compofed o f m any
fmall yellow flowers, not much unlike to thofe o f the dandelion, and the feed ffteth
away in down as that d o th ; you may eafily know the flowers by the tafte, for they
are very bitter.
Place. Jtgroweth w ild in many places o f the land, and may be plentifully found
near London, as between RedrifF and Deptford, by the ditch fides; its virtues are
held to be the fame with borage and buglofs, only this is fomething hotter.
T im e. T hey flower in June and July, and the feed is ripe fhortly after.
G overnm ent and V irtu es. T h ey are all three herbs o f Jupiter, and under

jaundice, and, mixed with fum itory, to cool, cleanfe, and temper, the blood, whereby
it helpeth the itch, ringworms, and tetters, or other fpreading fcabs or fores. T h e
flowers candied, or made into a confervc, are helpful in the former cafes, but are

lie very deep.
T im e . It flowereth in July and Auguft, fomeearlierand fome later thanother.
G overnment and V irtues. T h ey are furious martial plants: the roots o f
briony purge the belly with great violence, troubling the domach and burning the
liver, and therefore not raflily to be taken i but, being corre&ed, are very profitable
for the difeafes o f the head, as falling ficknefs, giddinefs, and fwimmings, by draw­
in g away much phlegm and rheumatic humours that opprefs the head, as alfo the
joints and finews, and therefore good for palfies, convulfions, cramps and ditches in
the fide, and the dropfy >and, in provoking urine, they cleanfe the reins and kidneys
from the gravel and done, by opening the obftrudtions o f the fpleen, and confum-
in g the hardnefs and fwellings thereof. I f the juice be tempered with the meal o f
vetches or fenugreek, or boiled in oil till it be confumed, it will takeaway black or
blue fpots, and Galen affirmeth it is a plant profitable for tanners to thicken their
leather hides with. T h e root fpread upon a piece o f fheep’s leather, in the manner o f
a plaider, while it is frefh and green, takes away black or blue marks, and all fears
and deformities o f the fk in ; it breaks hard apodhumes, draws forth fplinters and
broken bones, diflolves congealed blood, and, being laid on and ufed upon the hip,
or huckle-bone, fhoulders, arms, or any other part where there is great pain, it takes
it away in a fhort fpace, and w orks very effectually. T h e decoCtion o f the root in

an old ftrong cough, thofc that are troubled with ihortnefs o f breath, and is very
good for them that are bruifed inwardly, to help to expel the clotted or congealed
b lo od : the leaves, fruit, and root, do cleanfe old and filthy fores, are good aga r.lt all
fretting and running cankers, gangrenes, and tetters, and therefore the berries are b y
fome country people called tetter-berries. T h e root cleanfeth the fkin wonderfully
from all black and blue fpots, freckles, morphew, leprofy, foul fears, or other defor­
mity whatfoever; as alfo all running fcabs and manginefs are healed by the powder
o f the dried root, or the juice thereof, but efpecially by the fine white hardened
ju ic e ; the diftilled water o f the roots worketh the fame effedts, but more weakly ;
the root bruifed, and applied o f itfelf to any place where the bones are broken, help-
eth to draw them forth, as alfo fplimers and thorns in the flefh*
, and, being applied
with a little wine mixed therewith, it breaketh boils, and helpeth whitlows on the
joints.
F or all thefe latter com plaints, that is to fay, fores, cankers, & c . apply it outward­
ly, and take my advice along with you *
, you fhall find in the Difpenfatory, am ong
the preparations at the latter end, a medicine calledf*ecula b r i o n u e •, take that and ufe
it, (you have the way there how to make it,) and m ix it with a little hog’s greafe, or
other convenient ointment, and ufe it at your need.
A s for the former difeales, where it muft be taken inwardly, it purgeth very v io ­
lently, and needs an abler hand to corredl it than m oll counrry people have, therefore
it is a better way for them, in my opinion, to let the Ample alone, and take the com ­
pound water o f it, mentioned in my difpenfatory, and that is far more fafe, being wife­

Government and Virtues. It is a hot and biting martial plant: brooklimc
and water-creffes are generally ufed together in diet drinks, with other things, ferv-
ing to purge the blood and body from ill humours that would dcftroy health, and
are helpful for the fcu rvy: they do alfo provoke urine, and help to break the (tone
and pals it aw ay; they provoke women’s courfes, and expel the dead child. Being
fried with butter and vinegar, and applied warm, it helpeth all manner o f tumours,
fwellings, and inflammations.

T O fpend time in writing a defeription hereof is altogether needlefs, it being foge-
neraliy ufed by all the good houfewives almoft through this land to fweep their hou-
fes with, and therefore very well known to all forts o f people.
T h e broom-rape fpringeth upon many places from the roots o f the broom, b u t
more often in fields, or by hedge-fides, and on heaths. T he ftalk thereof is o f the
bignels o f a finger or thum b, above two feet high, having a (how o f leaves on them,
and many flowers at the top, o f a deadifh yellow colour, as alfo the ftalks and
leaves are.
P lace. T h ey grow in many places of this land com m only, and as com m only
fpoil all the land they grow in.
T im e . They flower in the fummer-months, and give their feed before winter.
G overnment and V irtues. T h e ju ice or decodlion o f the young branches o r
feed, or the powder o f the feed taken in drink, purgeth downwards and draweth
phlegmatic and watery humours from the joints, whereby it helpeth the dropfy,
gout, fciatica, and pains in the hips and jo in ts: it alfo provoketh ftrong vom its,
and, helpeth the pains o f the tides, and fwellings o f the fpleen *
, cleanfeth alfo the
reins, or kidneys and bladder o f the ftone, provoketh urine abundantly, and
hindereth the growing again o f the ftone in the body. T h e continual ufe o f the
powder o f the leaves and feed doth cure the black jau ndice: the diftilled water
o f the flowers is profitable for all the fame purpofes: it alfo helpeth furfeits, and
altereth the fits o f agues, if three or four ounces thereof, with as m uch o f the water
o f the fmaller centaury, and a little fugar put therein, be taken a little before the fit
com eth, and the party be laid down to fweat in bed. T h e oil or water, that is
drawn from the ends o f the green fticks heated in the fire, helps the tooth-ach,
T h e ju ice o f the young branches made into anointm ent o f old hog’s greafe and
anointed, or the young branches bruifed and heated in oil or hog’s greafe, and laid
to the tides pained by wind, as in ftitches, or the fpleen, eafeth them in once or twice
u fin g ; the fame, boiled in oil, is the fafeft and fureft medicine to kill lice in the head
or b od y; and is an efpecial remedy for joint-achs and fwoln knees that com e by the
falling down o f humours.

The
T h e broom-rape alfo is not without its virtues. T h e decoftion thereof in wine is
thought to be as effectual to avoid the (tone in the kidneys and bladder, and to pro-
vo k e urine, as the broom itfelf. T h e juice thereof is a fingular good help to cure
as well green wounds as old and filthy fores and malignant ulcers*, the infolace oil,
wherein there has been three or four repetitions o f inf ufion o f the top (talks with the
flowers (trained and cleared, cleanfeth the fkin from all manner o f fpots, marks,
and freckles, that arife either by the heat o f the fun or the malignity o f humours.
A s for the broom and broom-rape, M ars owns them; and it is exceeding prejudicial
to the liver, I fuppofe by reafon oftheantipathy between Jupiter and M a rs; there­

Government and V irtues. T h is is alfo under the dominion o f Saturn: the

it is joined with it: the leaves, being bruifed, and applied to warts, w ill m ake them

T h e white bugle difFereth not in form or greatnefs from the former, faving that
the leaves and ftalks are always green, and the flowers are white.

take inwardly, and an ointment and plaftcr o f it to ufe outwardly, always by you.
T h e decoction o f the leaves and flowers, made in wine, and taken, diflolveth the
congealed blood in thofe that are bruifed inwardly by a fall or otherwife, and is very
effectual for any inward wounds, thrufts, or (tabs, in the body or bowels, and is a
fpecial help in all wound-drinks, and for thofe that are liver-grown as they call it. It
’is wonderful in curing all manner o f ulcers and fores, whether new and frefli or old
and inveterate, and even gangrenes and fiftulas, if the leaves are bruifed and applied,
or thejuice ufed to wafh and bathe the places ; and the fame, made into a lotion with
fome honey and allum, cureth all fores o f the mouth or gum s, be they neverfo foul,
or o f long continuance j and worketh no lefs powerfully and effectually for fuch ul­
cers and fores as happen in the fecrec parts o f men or women. Being alfo taken in­
wardly, or outwardly applied, it helpeth thofe that have broken any bone, or have
any member out o f joint. A n ointment, made with the leaves o f bugle, fcabious,
and fanicle, bruifed, and boiled in hog’s greafe until the herbs be dry, and then
{trained forth into a pot, for fuch occafions as (hall require it, is fo Angularly good fpr
ail forts o f hurts in the body, that none who know its ufcfulnefs will be without it.
T h e truth is, I have known this herb cure fome difeafes o f Saturn, o f which I have
thought good to quote one. M any times fuch as give themfelves much to drinking
are troubled with ftrange fancies and fights in the night-tim e,and fome with voices,
as alfo with the difeafe epbialtes, or the m are: I take the reafon o f this to be, ac­
cording to F ern e liu s , a melancholy vapour, made thin by exceflivedrinking ftrong
liquor, which flies up and difturbs the fancy, and breeds imagination like itfelf,
i. e. fearful and troublefome. Thefe I have known cured by taking only two fpoon-
fuls o f the fyrup o f this herb about two hours after fupper, when you go to bed :
but whether this is done by fympathy or antipathy is rather d ou b tfu l; all thatknow
any thing in aftrology know that there is a great antipathy between Saturn and
Venus in matters o f procreation, yea, fuch a one, that the barrennefs o f Saturn can
be removed by none but Venus, nor the lull o f Venus be repelled by any but Sa­
turn 5 but I am not yet o f opinion it is done this way j my reafon is, becaufe thefe
vapours, though in quality melancholy, yet by their flying upward feem to be fome-
thing aerial s therefore I rather think it is done by fympathy, Saturn being exalted
in L ibra, the houfe o f Venus.

D e s c r i p t i o n . T h e great wild burnet hath winged leaves rifm gfrom the roots
like the garden burnet, but not fo m any; yet each o f thefc leaves are at leaf! twice
as large as the other, and nicked in the fame manner about the edges, o f a greyifh

T ime. T h ey flower about the end of June and'beginning of Ju ly, and their feed
is ripe in A uguft.
G o vernm ent and V irtues. It is an herbtheSun challengeth dominion over,
and is a m oil precious herb, little inferior to betony; the continual u fcof it preferves
the body in health, and the fpirits in v ig o u r; for, if the Sun be the preferver o f life
under G od, his herbs are the beft in the world to do it by. T h ey are accounted to
be both o f one property, but the fmaller is the moft effe&ual, becaufe quicker and
more arom atical; it is a friend to the heart, liver, and other principal parts o f a
•
man’s body: two or three o f the ftalks with leaves put into a cup o f wine, efpecially
claret, are known to quicken the fpirits, refrefli and chear the heart, and drive
away m elancholy; ic is a fpecial help to defend the heart from noifome vapours,
and from infection o f the peftilcnce, the ju ice thereof beingtaken in fome drink, and
the party laid to fweat immediately. T h ey have alfo a drying and an aftringent qua-'
lity, whereby they are available in all manner o f fluxes o f blood or humours, to
ftaunch bleedings inward orou tw ard ; lalks, fcourings, the bloody flux, women’s too-
abundant courfes, the whites, and the choleric belchingsand caftingsof the ftom ach;
and is a Angularly good herb for all forts o f wounds both o f the head and body,
either inward or outw ard; for all old ulcers, or running cankers, and moift fores; to
be uled cither by the ju ice or the decoftion o f the herb, or by the powder of the

things to be kept. T h e feed is alfo no lefs effe&ual both to flop fluxes and dry up

T H I S herb is aUo called petafitis.
D escription*. It rifeth up in February, with a thick (talk about a foot high,
whereon are fet a few fmall leaves, or rather pieces, and at the tops a long fpiked head
o f flowers, o f a blulh or deep red colour, according to the foil wherein it grow eth;
and, before the ftalk with the flowers have been a month above ground, they will be
withered and gone, and blown away with the wind, and the leaves w ill begin to
fpring, which being full grown are very large and broad, being fomewhat thin and
almoft round, whofe thick red footftalks, about a foot long, Rand towards the mid­
dle o f theleaves; the lower part being divided into two round parts, clofe almoft
one to another, o f a pale green colour, and hoary underneath: the root is long and
fpreading under the ground, being in fotne places no bigger than one’s finger, in
others larger, rather blackifh on the outfide and white within, and o f a very bitter •
and unpleafant tafte.
P l a c e a n d T i m e . T h e y grow in low and wet grounds by rivers and v/ater-
fides; their flowers (as is faid) rifing and decaying in February and M arch, before
the leaves, which appear in April.
G overnment and V irtues. It is under the dominion o f the Sun, and therefore
is a great ltrengthener o f the heart, and cheers the vital fpirits. T h e excellent
F uchsius, in his account o f this herb, is moft exprefs, and records its virtues as
wonderful in peftilential fevers; and this he fpeaks not from tradition, but his own
experience. W ere it needful to prove the fun gives light, it is fcarce lefs certain,
or lefs obvious, than that this root, bejond all things elfe, cures peftilential fevers.
Its roots are by long experience found to be very available againft the plague and
peftilential fevers, by provoking fweat; if the'powder thereof be taken in wine, it
alfo refifteth the force o f any other poifon: the root taken with zedoary and ange­
lica, or without them, helps the rifing o f the mother ; the deco&ion o f the root in
wine, is Angular good for thofe that wheeze much, or are Ihort*winded; it provok-
eth urine alfo and women’s courfes, and killeth flat and broad worms in the belly;
the powder o f the root doth wonderfully help to dry up the moifture o f fores that
are hard to be cured, and caketh away all fpots and blemifties o f the {kin.

T H E Y are alfo called perfonata, bardona, lappa major, great burdock, and clot-

Place. It grows plentifully by ditches and water-fides, and by the highways,
aimed every where throughout this land.
G overnm ent and V irtues. Venus challengeth this herb for her ow n; and, by
its feed or leaf, you may draw the wom b which way you pleafe, either upward by
applying it to the crown o f the head, in cafe it falls ou t, or downward in fits o f the
mother, by applying it to the foies o f the feet; or, if you would day it in its place,
apply it to the navel, and that is likewife a good way to ftay the child in it: the bur-
leaves are cooling, moderately drying, and difcufllng withal, whereby they are good for
old ulcers and lores. A drachm o f the roots, taken with pine-kernels, helpeth them
that fpit foul, mattery, and bloody, phlegm ; the leaves, applied to the places trou­
bled with the ihrinking o f the finews or arteries, giv e much c a fe : the ju ice o f the
leaves, or rather the roots themfelves, given to drink w ith old wine, doth wonderfully
help the bitings o f ferpents; and the root beaten w ith a little fait, and laid on the
place, fuddenly eafeth the pain thereof, and helpeth thofe that are bit by a mad
d og: the ju ice o f the leaves, taken with honey, provoketh urine, and remedieth the
pain o f the bladder: the feed, being drunk in wine forty days together, doth wonder-
fu lly help the feiatica: the leaves bruifed with the white o f an egg, and applied to
any place burnt with fire, take out the fire, give fudden eafe, and heal it up af­
terwards. T h e deco&ion o f them, fomented on any fretting fore or canker, ftayech
the corroding quality, which m uft be afterwards anointed with an ointment made o f
♦
the fame liquor, hog’s greafe, nitre, and vinegar, boiled together. Its roots may be
preferved with fugar, and taken fading, or at other times, for the faid purpofes, and
for confumptions, the done, and the la fk : the feed is m uch commended to break
the done, and caufes it to be expelled by urine, and is often ufcd with other feeds,
and things to that purpofe.

it had the Latin name frunmtumfarafenicum, and was tranfplanted from thence into
Italy, but now is very commonly Town in moft o f our northern counties, where, for the
ufe and profit made o f it, many fields are Town therewith. It is not ufually Town be­

all, and fo it will do the flowers when it bloflom s; it is ripe at the latter end o f A u -
guft, or the beginningof September, and will grow in a dry hungry ground*for which
it is held as good as a dunging.
G overnment and V irtues. T his grain is attributed to Venus*, it dothnour-

perfons, following hard labour; the bread or cakes made thereof, are plealant, buc
do fomewhat prefs or lie heavy on the ftomach. I never knew any bread or cakes
made o f it for people to eat in this country, but it is generally ufed to fatten hogs,
and poultry o f all forts, which it doth very exceedingly and quickly. T h e phyfical

the liquor or opobalfamum is o f more thin parts than the plant itfelf; the fruit or ber­

in the face, and maketh black fears become well-coloured, if the green herb be
boiled in wine, and laid to the place, or the place waffled therewith : being applied
to the huckle-bone, by continuance o f time it fpendeth the humours which caufe

away all forts o f agues, if the party grieved be anointed with that oil, taken from
the flowers, from the crown o f the head to the foie o f the foot, and afterwards laid
to fweat in his bed $ this is N ichessor an Egyptian’s medicine. It is profitable for
all forts o f agues that com e either from phlegm or m elancholy, or from an inflam­
mation o f the bowels, being applied when the humours caufing them lhall be con-
codted j and there is nothing more profitable to the fides and region o f the liver
and fpleen than th is; die bathing with a decodtion o f cam om ile taketh away weari-
nefs, eafeth pains to what part o f the body foever it be applied; it comforteth the
fmews that are overftrained, mollifieth all fwellings.; it moderately comforteth all
parts that have need o f warm th, digefleth and diflolveth whatfoever hath need there­
o f by a wonderful and fpeedy property. It eafeth all the pains o f thecholicand ftone,
and all pains and torments o f the belly, and gently provoketh urine: die flowers,
boiled in poflet-drink, provoke fweat, and help to expel colds, achs, and pains,
wherefoever, and are an excellent help to bring down women’s courfes; a fyrup
made o f the ju ice o f cam om ile with the flowers and white wine, is a remedy againft
thejaundice and drop fy; the flowers, boiled in lye, are good to wafli the head, and
com fort both it and the brain ; the oil, made o f the flowers o f camomile is much
ufed againft all hard fwellings, pains, or achs, fhrinking o f the finews, or cramps
or pains in the joints, or any other part o f the body *
, being ufed in clyfters, it help-

as though they were torn ; the flowers are long, thick, and whicilh, fet together al­
moft like a bunch of grapes, which being gone, there fucceed, for the moft part,
four (harp-pointed grains altogether, containing a fmall white kernel in them.
T h e fecond differs not much from this, except that it delights in more clear water \

great virtue, efpccially againft the peftilence, and aifo againd deadly poifons, as well taken in­
wardly as outwardly applied to the dingings andbitings of venomous beads; they nlfoarc healed

by drinking of the dcco&ion or didilled water, or a drachm of the powder: in like manner being

doth mitigate the pain of the guts and reins, and other griefs of the belly ; it provoketh fweat,
killcth worms, and is good againd other difeafes of the wom b: the herb itfclf, as well green as
dried, both drunk and laid outwardly to the grief, doth heal ulcers: on fuch extraordinary oc-
cafions it is mingled with the drink made of guaiacum, and with wine and water for the French'
difeafe. Learned writers affirm that it taketh away the (loppings o f the inward bowels ; it pro­

aUo that thofe cannot be infcclcd who take it in their meat or drink before they come into the air,
3 nd that it hclpcth them much that arc already infcclcd: moreover, mod agree, that it is a re­

honey or fugar, to make it the more palatable. O r you may make a potion thus: T ake a goo 1

bitter, it may be made fwcct as aforefaid. It is alfo to be obferved, that the powder and water of the
herb arc moil to be regarded, and cfpccially the water: for they may be long preferved, fo that
you may have them always in readinefs for ufe, when neither the green leaf nor juice can be had.
T he water, which only is free from bittemefs, may be drunk by itfelfalone, for the flomach and
tsftc will bear it, being equally as palatable as rofe-water. If the feed be Town as foonas it is ripe,
you may have the herb both winter and fummer, from the time that it beginneth to grow until the

the lum inaries; let it then be gathered when the Sun is in L eo , and the M oon in
Aries applying to his trine. L et L eo arife, then you may make it into an oil or
ointment, which you pleafe, to anoint fore eyes w ith ; I can prove it, both from my
own experience and the experience o f thofe to whom I have taught it, that the
m oft defperate fore eyes have been cured by this medicine only-, then, I pray', is not
this far better than endangering the eyes by the art o f the needle ? for, if this do not
tbfolu tely take away the film, it will fo facilitate the w ork that it may be done w ith­
out danger. T h e herb o r root being boiled in white wine with a few annifecds there­
in, and drunk, openeth obftru&ions o f the fiver and gall, helpeth the yellow ja u n ­
dice, and, often ufing it, helps the dropfy, the itch, and thofe who have old lores
in their legs, or other parts o f their body. T h e ju ice thereof taken fading, is held
to be o f lingular good ufe againft the peftilence; the diddled water with a little
fugar, and a little good treacle mixed therewith, (the party upon taking it being
laid down to fweat a little,) hath the fame effe ft: the ju ice, dropped into the eyes,
cleanfeth them from films and cloudinefs, which darken the fight; but it is bed to
allay the (harpnefs o f the ju ice with a little bread-m ilk; it is good in old, filthy, cor*
rodtng, creeping, ulcers wherefoever, to day their m alignity o f fretting and running,
and to caufe them to heal more fpeedily; the ju ice , often applied to tetters, ring­
worm s, or other fuch-like fpreading cankers, w ill q u ickly heal them, and, rubbed
often upon warts, w ill take them away. T h e herb, with the roots bruifed, and
bathed with oil o f cam om ile, and applied to the navel, taketh away the griping^
pains in the belly and bowels, and all the pains o f the mother, and, applied to wo­

T h e juice, mixed with fome powder o f brimftone, is not only good againll the itch,
but taketh away all difcolourings o f the (kin whatfoever, and, if it chance that in
a tender body it caufeth any itching or inflammation, it is helped.
Another bad method have phyficians in adminiftering relief to the eye, which is
worfe than the needle: that is, to eat away the film by corroding or gnawing medi­
cines • this 1 abfolutely proteft againft; i. Becaufe the tunicles o f the eyes are very
thin, and therefore loon eaten afunder. 2. T h e callus or film that they would eat
away is feldom o f an equal thicknefs in every place, and by that means the tuni-
cle may be eaten afunder in one place, before the Him be confumed in another, and
fo prove a readier way to extinguifli the fight than to reftore it. It is called chclU
ionium from the Greek word which flgnifies a fwallow, becaufe they fay, that
if you prick out the eyes o f young fwallows when they are in the neft, the old ones
will recover their eyes again with this herb. T h is I am confident o f, (for I have
tried it,) that, if you mar the very apple o f their eyes with a needle, (he w ill reco­
ver them again ; but whether with this herb or not, I do not know.
A lfo, I have read, (and it feems to me fomewhat probable,} that the herb being
gathered, as I (hewed before, and the elements.feparated from it by the art o f the
alchymift, and, after they are drawn apart, rectified, the earthy quality (till in rec­

It is an experiment worth the trying, and can do no harm.

made into an oil, ointment, or plaifter, readily cures both the piles, hemorrhoids,

ftalks a yard long, whereon doth grow many fmall and almoft round leaves, dented
about the edges, fet on both fides o f a middle r ib ; at the joints come forth one or
two flowers upon fharp footftalks, peafe-fafhion, either whitifh or purplifh red,

T h ey are no lefs windy than beans, but nourifh more*, they provoke urine, and are
thought to increafe fperm they have a cleanfing faculty, -whereby they break the
ftone in the kidneys. T o drink the cream o f them being boiled in water is the beft
way. It moveth the belly downwards, provoketh women’s courfes and urine, and
increafeth both m ilk and feed. O ne ounce o f cicers, tw o ounces o f French barley,
and a fmall handful o f marfhmallow-roots, clean wafhed and cut, being boiled in
the broth o f a chicken, and four ounces taken in the morning, fatting two hours
after, is a good medicine for a pain in the Tides. T h e white cicers are ufed more fo r
meat than medicine, yet have they the fame effed , and are thought more powerful
to increafe m ilk and feed.
T h e wild cicers are fo much more powerful than the garden kinds, by how m uch
they exceed them in heat and drinefs, whereby they are more effectual in opening
obftruftions, breaking the ftone, and having all the properties o f cutting, opening,
digefting, and diffolving, more fpeedily and certainly than the former.

either in white wine or white wine vinegar, you (hall very (eldom mifs the cure o f
an ague, be it what ague foever, in three fits, as I have often proved to the admira­

fevers, whether infectious or peftilential; or among other herbs to cool and temper
the blood and humours in the body.: as alfo, for all lotions, gargles,. injections, and
the like, for fore mouths, ulcers, cankers, fiftulas, and other corrupt, foul, or run­

gether, cureth.the quinfey and the yellow jaundice, and, taken for thirty days toge­
ther, cureth the falling fickiiefs. T h e roots boiled in m ilk, and drunk, are a moft
effectual remedy for all fluxes in man or woman, whether the whites or reds, as alfo
the bloody flux. T h e roots boiled in vinegar, and the decoClion thereof held in the

honey, helpeth the hoarfenefs o f the throat, and is very good for the cough o f the
lungs. T h e diftilled water both o f the root and leaves, is alfo effectual to all the
purpofes aforefaid; and, if the hands are often waffled therein, and it be fuffered al­
ways to dry in o f itfelf without wiping; it will in a fliort time help the palfy, or (bak­

bled with weak backs, and the effects thereof. T h e ju ice o f the herb put into aleor
beer, and drunk, bringeth down women’s courfes, and expelleth the after-birth.
It is an ufual courfe with many men, when they have gotten the running o f the
reins, or women the whites, they have immediate recourfe to the clary-bufh, which,
having fried in butter, they eagerly eat in expectation o f inftant relief, but to their
great difappointment often find themfelves worfe than before they had tried this
expedient. W e will grant that clary ftrengthens the b a c k ; but this we deny, that
the caufe o f the running o f the reins in men or the*'whites in women lies in the back,
(though the back may fonietimes be weakened by them,) confequently the applica­

powder o f the dried herb, ftrewed thereupon, doth the fame, and likewife helpeth old
ulcers. Being boiled with hog’s greafe, it healeth all forts o f hard fwellings or ker­

■ ftalks, with long h u lk s; the flowers are very like the flowers o f ftock gilliflowers,
o f a pale purplilh colour, confiding o f four leaves apiece, after which come fmall
cods which contain the feed : the root is very fmooth, white, and fhining; it doth
not grow downwards, but creeping along under the upper cruft o f the ground, and
confifteth o f divers fmall round knobs fet together: towards the top o f the ftalk
there grow fmall fingle leaves, by each o f which cometh a fmall round cloven bulb,
which, when it is ripe, if itbe fet in the ground, will grow to be a root, and iselteem-
ed a good way o f cultivating the herb.
A s for the other coral-wort which groweth in this nation, it is more fcarce than
this, and is a very fmall plant, not much unlike crow-foot, therefore fome think it to
be one o f the forts o f crow-foot. I know not where to direct you to it, and there­
fore fhall forbear the description.

G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . It is under the dominion o f Jupiter. T h e or­
dinary coflm ary, as well as maudlin, provoketh urine abundantly, and moiftenech
the hardnefs o f the mother? it gently purgeth choler and phlegm , extenuating that
which isgrofs, and cutting that which is tough and glutinous, cleanfeth that which
is foul, and hindereth putrefaction and corruption; itdifiblveth without attraction,
openeth obftruftions, and healeth their evil effects, and is a wonderful help to all
forts o f dry agues. It is aflringent to the ftomach, and ftrengtheneth the liver, and
all theother inward parts, and if taken in whey worketh the m oreeffe&ually. T a k en
fading in the m orning, it is very profitable for the pains o f the head that are con­
tinual, and to flay, dry up, and confume, all thin rheums, or diftillations from the
head into the ftomach, and helpeth m uch to digeft raw humours that are gathered
therein. It is very profitable for thofethat are fallen into a continual evil difpofi-
tion o f the whole body, called cachexia, being taken, efpecially in the beginning o f
the difeafe. It is an efpecial friend and help to evil, w eak, and cold, livers. T h e feed
is familiarly given to children for the worms, and fo is the infufion o f the flowers in
white wine, given them to the quantity o f two ounces at a tim e: it maketh an ex­
cellent falve to cleanfe and heal old ulcers, being boiled with oil olive, and adder’s
tongue with it, and, after it is drained, to put in a little wax, rofin, and turpentine,
to bring it into a convenient body.

the flowers are fallen, come fm all feed wrapped up with the down therein, and is
carried away with the wind. T h e root is fmall and thready.
There are other forts hereof, which are fomewhat lefs than the former, not much
different, fave only that the B alk and leaves are Ihorter, and that the flowers are
paler, and more open.
P lace. They grow in dry, barren, Tandy, and gravelly, grounds, in moft places
o f this land.
T im e . T h ey flower about July, fome earlier and fome later, and their feed is
ripe in A uguft.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . Venus is lady o f it. T h e plants are all aflrin-
gent, or binding and drying, and therefore profitable for defluxions o f rheum from
the head, and to flay fluxes o f blood wherefoever. T h e deco&ion being made into
red wine and drunk, or the powder taken therein, alfo helpeth the bloody flux, and
eafeth the torments to come thereby, flayeth the immoderate courfes o f women, and
is alfo good for inward or outward wounds, hurts, and brulfes, and helpeth children
both o f burftings and the worms, and the difeafe called ttmfmus, (which is a frequent
but vain provocation to flool,) being either drunk or inje&ed. T h e green leaves,
bruifed and laid to any green wound, will flay the bleeding, and heal it up q u ic k ly ;
the deco&ion or juice thereof doth the fame, and helpeth all old and filthy ulcers.
T h e juice o f the herb taken in wine and m ilk, is (as Pliny faith) a fovereign remedy
againft the quinfey; he further faith, that whofoever fhall fo take it fliall never be
troubled with that difeafe again. T h e tops o f this plant, before it has reached its
full growth, have the fame virtue. I have feen it ufed only in one place. It is fre­
quent in Charlton Forefl, in Suflex, and was given with fucccfs for that alnioft in­
curable difeafe the chin-cough. Beat it up into a conferve, very fine, with a deal
o f fugar, and let the bignefs o f a pea be eaten at a time.

T im e. T h ey flower in A p ril and M ay.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . Venus lays claim to the herb as her own, and it is
under the fign Aries,^and our city-dames know well enough that the ointment or dif-
i tilled
tilled water o f it adds beauty, or at leaft reftores it when it i$ loft. T h e flowers arc
held to be more .effectual than the leaves, and the roots o f little ufe. A n ointment,
being made with them, taketh away fpots and wrinkles o f the (kin, fun-bum ing, and
freckles, and adds beauty exceedingly; they remedy all infirmities o f the head com ­
ing o f heat and wind, as vertigo, ephialtes, falfe apparitions, phrenzies, falling fick-
nefs, palfies, convulfions, cramps, and pains in the nerves *
, the roots eafe pains jn
the back and bladder, and open the pafiages o f urine. T h e leaves are good in
wounds, and the flowers take away trem bling. I f the flowers be not well dried and
kept in a warm place, they will foon pucrify and look green ; have a fpecial eye over
them. I f you let them fee the fun once a month, it will do them no harm.
Becaufe they ftrengthen the brain and nerves, and remedy the palfies, the G reeks
gave them the name o f paralyfis. O f the flowers preferved, or conferved, the quan­
tity o f a nutmeg eaten every m orning is a fuflkient dofe for inward difeafes; but,
for wounds, fpots, w rinkles, and fun-burning, an ointment is made o f the leaves
and hog’s greafe.

edges o f them, alfo very fliarp pointed; the ftalks, which bear flowers, fcldom grow
fo high as the leaves, bearing a forked head like a crab’s claw, out o f which comes
a white flower, confiding of three leaves, with divers ycllowifli hairy threads in the
m iddle: it taketh root in the mud in the bottom o f the water.
P lace. It groweth plentifully in the fens in Lincolnfliire.
T im e. It flowers in June, and lifually from thence till A ugu ft.
Government and V irtues. It is a plant under the dominion o f Venus, and
therefore a great ftrengthener o f the reins ; it is excellent good in that inflammation
which is commonly called St. Anthony’s fire; it afluageth all inflammations and
fwellings in w ounds; and an ointment made o f it is excellent good to heal th em :
there is fcarce a better remedy growing than this for fuch as have bruifed their k id ­

taken every morning is a very good remedy to flop the terms.

G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . It is under the dominion o f M ars, and is a plant
o f a hot and biting nature: the truth is, the feed o f black crefTes ftrengthen the brain
exceedingly, being in performing that office little inferior to muflard feed, if at a ll:
they areexcellent good to ftay ihofe rheums which fall down from the head upon the
lungs. Y o u may beat the feed into powder, and make it up into an elefluary with
honey, fohave you an excellent remedy by you, not only for the premiles, butalfo
for the cough, yellow jaundice, and fciacica. T h e herb, boiled into a poultice,

Place. It groweth in many moilt grounds, as well meadows as unfilled places
about London, in Ham pltead church-yard, at W ye in K ent, and fundry other
places.
T ime. It fiowereth from M ay all the fummer long, in one place or another, as
they are more open to the Sun ; the feed ripeneth foon after.
G overnment and V irtues. It is under the dominion o f Saturn. T h is is a lin­
gular good wound-herb, and is ufed inwardly, not only to day bleeding o f wounds,
but to confolidate them, as it doth outwardly any green wound, which it quickly
drieth up and healeth. T h e decoction o f the herb in wine, helpeth to expeftorate
phlegm out o f the ched, and is good for obftruttions in the bread, ftomach, or
bowels, and helpeth a decayed appetite, (t is alfo good to wa(h any wound or fore
w ith, to cleanfe and heal it. T h e herb bruited and then boiled, and applied out­
wardly for certain days together, renewing it often, and in the mean time the decoc­

M A N Y are the names this furious biting herb hath obtained: it is called frog’s
foot from the Greek name b&rrakiony crow-foot, gold-knobs, gold-cups, king’s-
knob, baffiners, troil-flowers, polts, locket-goulions, and butter-flowers.
So
So abundant are the forts o f this herb, that to dtfcribe them all would tire the
patience o f Socrates him felf; therefore I fhall only mention the moft ufual.
D escription. T h e moft common crow-foot hath many dark green leaves, cu t
into divers parts, in tafte biting and (harp, bliftering the tongue ; it bears many
flowers, and thole o f a bright refplendent yellow colour. V irgins in ancient times
ufed to make powder o f them to furrow bride-beds. A fter the flowers com e fmall
heads, fomewhat fpiked and rugged like a pine-apple.
P lace. T h ey grow very common every-where*, unlefs you turn your head into
a hedge, you cannot but fee them as you walk.
T ime. They flower in May and June, even till September.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . T h is fiery and hot-fpirited herb o f M ars is no
way fit to be given inwardly; but an ointment o f the leaves or flowers w ill draw a
blifter, and may be fo fitly applied to the nape o f the neck, to draw back rheum from
the eyes. T h e herb being bruifed, and mixed with a little m uftard, draws a blifter
as well and as perfeftly as cancharides, and with far lefs danger to the veffels o f urine,
which cancharides naturally delight to wrong. I knew the herb once applied to a
peftilential rifing that was fallen down, and it faved life even beyond hope; it were
good keeping an ointment and plafter o f it, if it were but for that.

the root aforefaid, it fomewhat allayech the fharp biting tafte thereof upon the tongue.
T h e green leaves bruifed, and laid upon any boil or plague-fore, do very wonder­
fu lly help to draw forth the poifon. A drachm o f the powder o f the dried root
taken with twice as much fugar, in the form o f a licking electuary, or the green root,
doth wonderfully help thofe that are purfy or fhort-winded, as alio thofe that have a
co u g h ; it breaketh, digefteth, and riddech away, phlegm from the ftomach, chert,
and lungs j the m ilk, wherein the root hath been boiled, is effectual alio for the
fame purpofe. T h e faid powder, taken in wine or other drink, or die juice o f the ber­
ries, or the powder o f them, or the wine wherein they have been boiled, provoketh
urine, and bringeth down women’s courfes, and purgeth them effectually after child­
bearing, to bring away the after-birth : taken with fheep’s m ilk, it healeth the in­
ward ulcers o f the bowels. T h e diftilled water hereof is effectual to all the purpofes
aforefaid. A fpoonful taken at a time healeth the itch; and an ounce or more, taken
at a time for fome days together, doth help the rupture; the leaves, either green or
dry, or the juice o f them, do cleanfe all manner o f rotten and filthy ulcers, in what
part o f the body foever, and healeth the ftinking fores in the nofc, called polypus.

from them, and let fuch as are troubled with ulcers in their bladders drink no other

N ames. T H E Latin names for currants are rtbesy and ribes fruftu rubro the red
currant, albo white, and nigro black.
Description. T h e red currant-bufn hath a ftalk covered with a thin brownifh
bark outwards, and greenifh underneath; the leaves are o f a blackiih green, cut on
the edges into five parts, much like a vine-leaf, but fm aller; the flowers come forth
at the joints o f the leaves, many together on a long ttalk, hanging down about a fin­
ger’s len gth ; o f an herby colour, after which come round berries, green at the firtt,
b u t red when they are ripe: o f a pleafant tart tatte, wherein is fmall feed; the root
is woody and fpreading.
There is another fort thereof, whofe berries are twice as large as the former, and
o f a better relifh.
T h e white currant tree hath a taller and ftraighter ftem than the red, a whiter
bark, and fmaller leaves, but hath fuch-like berries upon long ftalks, o f the fame
bignefs as the firtt, but o f a Aiming tranfparent whitenels, and o f a more pleafant
tatte than the former.
T h e black currant rifeth higher than the laft, and is thicker fet with branches
round about, and more pliant, the younger covered with a pale, and the elder with
a browner, b a rk ; the leaves are fmaller than thofe o f the former, and often with
fewer cuts therein : the flowers are alike, but o f a greenifli purple colour, which
produce fmall black berries > the leaves and fruit have an unpleafant fmell, but yet
are wholefome, though not pleafant.
Place. A ll thefe forts o f currants grow plentifully in England, in gardens where
they are planted ; they have been found growing naturally wild in Savoy in Swit­
zerland, as Gefner faith ; andfom ein A uftria, faith C laufius: they grow in great
abundance in Candia, and other places in the Screights, from whence in great quan­
tities they are brought dried unto us.
T ime. They flower and bear fruit in June, July, and A ugu ft.
G o v e r n m e n t an d V i r t u e s . Currants are under the influence o f the benevolent
planet V enus; they are o f a moift, temperate, refrefoing, nature i the red and white
currants
142 C (J L P E P £ R ’s E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
currants are good to cool and refrefh faintings o f the ftomach, to quench thirft, and
ftir up an appetite, and therefore are profitable in hot and (harp agues: it tempereth
the heat o f the liver and blood, and the fharpnefs o f choler, and refifteth putrefac­
tion ; ic alio taketh away the loathing o f meat, and weaknefs o f the ftomach by m uch
vom iting, and is good for thofe that have any loofenefs o f the belly *
, Gefner faith
that the Switzers ule them for the cough, and fo well they m ay; for, take dry cur­
rants a quarter o f a pound, o f brandy half a pint, fee the brandy on fire, then bruife
the cm rants and put them into the brandy while it is burning, ftirring them until the
brandy is almoft confumeci, that it becomes like unto an elc&uary, andit is an excel­
lent remedy to be taken hot for any violent cough, cold, or rheum. T h e black cur­
rants and the leaves areufed in fauces by thole who like the tafte and feent o f them ;
which I believe very few do o f either.

G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . Saturn rules this plant, the leaves and fruit are
dry in the third degree, w ithout any manifeft heat, and very aftringent; the fruit o f
cyprefs, taken into the body, (loppeth loofenefs and the bloody-fiux, and is good

D escription-. T h e greater cedar groweth verytall, high, great, and thick ; the
bark from the foot o f the ftem unto the firft branches is rough, and from thence up
to the cop it is fmooth and plain, o f a dark blue colour, out o f which there droppech
white rofin o f its own kind, which is moift, odoriferous, or o f a iweec find], and by
the heat o f the fun it becomes dry and hard ; the limbs and branches o f this tree
are long, and parted into many other fmall branches, (landing dire&ly one againft
' another, like thofe o f the fir-tree ; the faid branches are garnifhed with many fmall
leaves, thick and fhort, having a fvveet favour; the fruit is like that o f the fir-tree,
but larger, thicker, and harder; the whole tree groweth ftraight up like the fir-tree.
O f the fmallcr cedar there are two kinds * the firft kind of fmall cedar is much
like to juniper, but fomewhat fmaller, the ftem is crooked or writhed, and covered
with a rough bark-, the fruit is round berries, like juniper-berries, but fomewhat
greater o f colour*, at the firft green, then yellow, and at laft reddifh, and o f an
indifferent good tafte.
T h e fecond kind o f fmall cedar groweth not high j but remaineth fmall and low,
like the other} the leaves o f this are not prickly, but fomewhat round and mofly at
the ends, almoft like the leaves o f tamarifk and lavin; the fruit o f this kind bearcth
alfo round berries, which at firft are green, afterwards yellow , and, when they are
ripe, they become reddifh, and are bitter in tafte.
P lace. T h e great cedar groweth in Africa and Syria, and upon the mountains
o f Libanus, Amanus, and Taurus.
T h e fecond kind groweth in Phoenicia, and in certain places o f Italy, in Calabria,
and alfo in Languedoc.
T h e third kind groweth in L ycia, and is found in certain parts o f France, as in
Provence and Languedoc.
T im e. T h e great cedar perfected! its fruit in two years, and it is never with­
out fruit, which is ripe at the beginning o f winter. T h e fmall cedar-trees are always
green, and loaded with fruit, having at all times upon them fruit both ripe and
unripe, as hath juniper.
G overnment and V ir t u e s. T h e great cedar is under the dominion o f the Sun,
the fmaller o f M ars; the cedar is hot and dry in the third degree; the rofin or
liquor cedria, which runneth forth o f the great cedar-tree, is hot and dry almoft in
the fourth degree, and o f fubtil parts.
T h e fruit o f the fmall cedar is alfo hot and dry, but more moderately; cedria, that
is, the liquor or gum o f cedar, affuageth the tooth*ach, being put into the hollow-
nefs o f the fame; alfo, it cleareth the fight, and taketh away fpots and fears o f the
eyes, being laid thereon; the fame, dropped into the ears, with vinegar, killeth the
2 worms
worms o f the fam e; and, with the wine o f the deco£Uon o f hyfop, it cureth the
noife and ringing in the ears, and makes the hearing good.
T h e ancient Egyptians d-d ufe, in times paft, to preferve their dead bodies with
this cedria> for it keepeth the fame whole, and preferveth them from corruption,
but it confumeth and corrupteth living flt-fli ; it killeth lice, moths, worms, and
all fuch vermin, fo that they will not come near it.
T h e fruit o f the cedar is good to be eaten againft the ftranguary ; it provokes
urine, and brings down women’s courfes.

T h e male beareth red flowers, the female white, in all things clfe the one is like
the other ; out o f the root o f the female ciftus is drawn forth a fap or liquor called
hippocriftis.
T h e fecond kind o f ciftus is called alfo Udum and ladum\ the fat liquor which is
gathered from it is called ladanum, and in Ihops lapdanum.

fage, but lhorter and rounder; the flowers grow at the tops o f the ftalks, o f the
fafliion o f a Angle rofe, whereof the male kind is o f colour red, and the female
w hite; at the laft they change into knops, or hulks, wherein the feed is contained.
T h ere is found a certain excrefcencc or out-grow ing, about the root o f this plant,
which is o f colour fomecimes yellow, fometimes white, and fometimes green; out
o f which is artificially drawn a certain ju ice, which, in fhops is called hypociftis,

G overnment and V irtues. T h e green plant is cold and dry, o f a Saturnine
quality, hurtful to the b o d y ; but the fweet favouring feed is o f a warm temperature,
and ufeful for many purpofes; the feed o f coriander, being prepared, and taken alone,
or covered with fugar, after meals, clofeth up the m outh o f the ftomach, flayeth v o ­

and bringeth forth worms out o f the body, and ftoppeth the lafk and bloody flux,
and all other extraordinary iflues o f blood. Coriander ought not to be covered with
fugar, or to be put into any meat or medicine, nor ufed anyw ay unprepared: the
way o f preparing it is after this manner, v iz. T a k e o f the feed o f coriander well dried,
and pour thereupon good ftrong wine and vinegar m ixed together, and fo leave them
to fteep for the fpace o f four and twenty hours>then take the feeds out o f the liquor

good to cafe fwellings and pains; it alfo ftayeth the belly and ftomach from catling ;
the decoction thereof helpeth women that are troubled with the pains and windinefs
o f the mother, if they fit therein. It ftayeth the hiccough, being boiled in wine, and
only fmelled to, being tied in a cloth. T h e feed is o f more ufe than the leaves,
and more effectual to digefl raw and vifeous hum ours, and is ufed in medicines
that ferve to expel w ind, and the pains proceeding therefrom. Thefeed being toafted

G overnm ent and V irtues, A ll dodders are under Saturn. Thedodder which
grows upon thyme is generally much hotter than that which grows upon colder
herbs, for it draws nourishment from what it grows upon, as well as from the earth
where its root is; T h is is accounted the m olt effectual for melancholic difeafes, and
to purge black or burnt cholcr, which is the caufe o f many diieafes o f the head and

humours, and helpeth children’s agues, a little worm feed being put thereto.
T h e other dodders (as I obferved before) participate o f the nature o f thofe plants
whereon they grow, as that which hath been found growing upon nettles in the

T h e lecond kind, called ballard di&arrmum, is very much like the firft, except in
tafte; it does not bite or hurt the tongue, as does the former, neither is it fo hot. 1c
hath round, foft, woolly, ftalks, with knots and joints, at each o f which joints there
ftand two leaves, fomewhat round, fofr, and woolly, not much unlike the leaves of.
penny-royal, but that they are larger, all hoary and white, foft and woolly, without
any fmell, but bitter in tafte; the flowers are o f a light blue, compaffing the (talk,
at certain fpaces like garlands, and like the flowers of penny-royal and hoarhound;
the root is o f a woody fubftance.
T h e third k in d fclik e the fecond in figure, faving that its leaves are greener and

T h e fame virtue hath the root, which is hot and (harp upon the tongue ; the ju ic e
is very good to be drunk againd all venoms, and the bitings o f venom ous beads-

it is alfo neceffary that its vices (hould not be concealed; its heat is very vehement,
and every thing o f that defcri ption naturally conveys ill vapours to the brain ; in cho­

the humour, and confounds the idea with ftrange vifions and fancies, and therefore
ought to be taken with the ftri&eft care by thofe whofe illdilpofition o f body

G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . T h ey are fine temperate flowers, o f the nature
and under the dominion o f Ju p iter; even fo temperate, that noexcefs, either in heat,
cold, drinefs, or moifture, can be perceived in them. T h ey are great ftrengtheners
o f the brain and heart, and w ill therefore make an excellent cordial for family pur-
pofes. Either the conferve or fyru p o f thefe flowers, taken at intervals, is good to
help fuch whole conftitution is inclinable to be confumptive. It is good to expel
poifon and help hot peftilent fevers.

P lace. It groweth ufually in gardens.
T ime. It flowereth in June and July, and thefeed is ripe in A uguft.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . It is an herb under the dominion o f M ercury. It
ftrengthens the brain and apprehenfion exceedingly, and relieves them when droop­
in g; taken with honey, it is a remedy for coughs, hardnefs o f the fpleen, and diffi­
culty o f urine; or, made into a deco&ion and drunk, it helpeth thofe who are trou­
bled with the dropfy, efpecially if taken at the beginning o f the diforder. It alfo
bringeth down women’s courfes, and expelleth the dead c h ild ; being drunk in wine
and the bruifed herb outwardly applied, it is a certain cure for the poifon o f fer-
pcnts; ufed with honey, it cleanfeth old and foul ulcers, and made into an oil, and
the eyes anointed therewith, taketh away the moifture and dimnefs o f them, and is
good for the pains o f the fides and cramps. T h e decottion thereof, taken for fome
days together, driveth away and cureth both the tertian and quartan agu es; it is
alfo good againft all dileales o f the brain, as continual head-ach, falling ffcknels,
^melancholy, drowfinefs and dulnefs o f the fpirits, convulflons, and palfy. A drachm
o f the feed taken in powder purgeth by urine, and is good againft the yellow jaun­
dice ; the ju ice o f the leaves dropped into the ears killeth the worms in them ; and
the tops thereof, when they are in bloom, fteeped twenty-four hours in a draught o f
white wine and drunk, k ill and expel worms in the belly.

the hufks, when they are ripe, will open tliemfelves, and contain their feed two or
three months before they fhed it.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . It is fuppofcdto be under the dominion o f Saturn.
A decoction o f the roots purgeth corrupt phlegm and choler, but, when wanted to

drakes or fpots thereon; the (talks are divided towards the top into many ftnall
branches, bearing thereon (mall yellow flowers, all which are turned one w ay; thefe,
being ripe, arefucceeded by a kind o f down, which is carried away by the wind.
T h e root confitts o f many fmall fibres, which grow but a little beneath the furface o f
the ground j it liveth for fome years, (hooting forth new branches yearly, which
perifh at the approach o f winter.
P l a c e . It grows in the open places o f woods and coppices, both in moi(t and
dry grounds, in many parts o f this kingdom .
T i m e . It flowerech about the month o f July.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . Venus claims dominion over this herb. It is
fpoken o f by Arnoldus de V illa N ova as a m od excellent remedy for the (lone in the
reins and kidneys, as alfo to expel the gravel by urine. T h ed ecottion o f the herb,
either green or dry, or thediftilled water thereof, is very effectual for inward bruifes,
Likewife for (laying the floodings o f the body, as fluxes o f humours, blojdy fluxes,
and the immoderate menfes o f women j and is mofl available in all ruptures or burft-
ings, being internally or externally applied. It is a fovereign wound-herb, whereby
green wounds and old ulcers are fpeediiy cured j it is o f particular efficacy in all
lotions for fores or ulcers in the mouth, throat, or privities, o f either lex. A decoc­
tion is ferviceable to fatten the teeth when loofe.

o f fields, and fometimes in gardens.
T ime. It flowereth in Ju ly, feeding about the latter end o f the fame month.
G overnment a n d V irtues. Saturn is the ruler o f this plant. It is probable
it took the name o f gout-herb from its peculiar virtues in healing the cold gout and

diforders j as alfo joint-achs, and other cold diforders. It is even affirmed, that the
very carrying o f it about in the pocket w ill defend the bearer from any attack o f
the aforefaid complaint.
G R O M E L .
O F this I (hall briefly defcribe three kinds, which are chiefly ufed medicinally s
the virtues o f each are the fame, but different in the manner o f their growth.
D escriptor. T h e greater grom el rifeth up with (lender, hard, and hairy, (talks,
trailing and taking root as it lieth on the ground; it fpreads itfelf by feveral fmall
branches, whereon grow hairy dark green leaves. A t the joints with the leaves
grow many fmall blue flowers, which are fucceeded b y hard, ftoney, roundifh, feed.
T h e root is round and woody, and liveth during the winter, fhooting forth frefli
herbage every fpring.
T h e fmall wild grom el groweth up with feveral ftraight,hard, branched,flalks, cwo
or threefeet high, full o fjoints, bearing at each, fmall, long, hard, and rough, leaves,
very much like the form er, but lefs. A m ong thefe leavesgrow fmall white blflfToms,
which are followed by greyifh round feed like the Si ft. T h e root is not very large,
buc exceeding thready.
T h e garden gromel hath many upright, (lender, woody, hairy, flalks*brown and
crefted, with but few branches, bearing leaves like the form er; che flowers are
white, after which com eth rough brown husks, containing white, hard, round, feed,
Jhining like pearls, and greater than cither o f the form er. T h e root is like that o f
the flrfl, with many branches and flrings thereat, and o f long duration.
P lace. T h e tw o firft grow w ild in barren and untilled places. T h e laft is a
nurfling in the gardens o f the curious.
T im e. T h ey all flower from M idfum m er till Septem ber, and the feed ripeneth
quickly after.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . T h e dominion over thefe herbs is wholly claimed
by Venus. T h ey are o f Angular force in breaking the ftoneand expelling gravel,
either in the reins or bladd er; as alfo to provoke urine, and help the ftranguary,
T h e feed is moft effectual for the above purpofes, being bruifed and boiled in white
wine, or other convenient liq u o r; the powder o f the feed is equally efficacious.
T w o drachms o f the feed in powder taken with breafl~mi)k, will procure a fpcedy
delivery to women afflicted with hard travail, and that cannot be delivered. T h e
herb itfelf, (when the feed is not to behad,) either boiled, or (hejuice thereof drunk,

G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . T h ey are under the dominion o f Venus. T h e
berries, whilft they are unripe, being fealded or baked, are good to procure the re­
turn o f aloft appetite, efpecially if the caufe proceeds from a ftomach afHi&ed with
choleric humours. T hey are exceeding good to ftay the longing o f pregnant wo­
men. T h e decoction o f the leaves o f the tree cools hot fwellings and inflamma­
tions, as aUb the St. Anthony's fire. T h e ripe goofeberries, being eaten, are an ex­
cellent remedy to allay the violent heat o f the ftomach and liv er; and the young
and tender leaves break the ftone and expel the gravel both from the bladder and
kidneys. I f they are taken immoderately, they are fuppofed to breed crude hu­
mours, and ingender worms.

upright, bearing at the top many fmall, whice, andfweet-fmclling, flowers, laid open
like a liar, confiding o f five round-pointed leaves, with many yellow threads (land­

in time proveth to be the feed-veffcl i when ripe, it is o f a five-fquare fiiape, with a
fmall point, containing feed as fmall as dud.
P l a c e . It groweth but feldom in fields, but frequently in woods in the northern
counties in this kingdom , as Yorkfhire, Lancafhire, & c.
T i m e . It fiowereth in June and July, (bedding its feed foon after.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . W inter-green is under the dominion o f Saturn,
and is an excellent remedy for the fpeedy healing o f green wounds, the leaves
being bruifed and applied, or thejuice o f them is equally effc«flual. A falve made o f
the bruifed herb, orthe juice boiled in hog’s lard, orw ithlallad-oil and wax, adding
a little turpentine thereto, is a fovereign medicine, and in high eftimation among
the Germans, who ufe it to heal all manner o f wounds, ulcers, and fores. T h e herb
boiled in wine and water, and drunk by thofe who are troubled with ulcers in their
kidneys, or neck o f the bladder, wonderfully helpeth them. It (layeth all fluxes,
whether o f blood or humours, as the !a(k, bloody flux, immoderate menftrua, and

bleeding o f wounds, and taketh away fuch inflammations as rife from the pains o f
the heart. It is no lefs available for foul ulcers that are hard to be cured, as alfo for

heads, out o f which grow yellow threads or thrum bs, which are the flowers: thefe
continue many days thus blown before they are turned into down, which with the
feed is carried away with the wind. Its root is fmall and thready, foon perUhing,

T im e . It may be feen in bloom at alrnoft any tim e o f the year, and, if permitted
to occupy good ground, each plant will fpring and feed at leaft twice in a year.
G overnment and V irtues. T h is herb is influenced by Venus. It is a uni-
verlal medicine for all difeafes proceeding from heat, in whatever part o f the body
they may chance to happen; it is a fafe and gentle purge for a foulftom ach, operat­
ing each way. It is o f a moift and cold nature, confequently caufeth expulfion, and
reprefleth the heat caufed by the motion o f the internal parts, through the effe&s o f
an emetic or other medicine. T h is herb, preferved either as a fyrup, an ointment,
or diftillcd water, is a medicine unrivalled in its efficacy for the cure o f all hot
difeafes, both for its fafety and fpeed. T h e deco&ion o f this herb, as Diofcorides
obferves, made with wine, helpeth the pains o f theftom ach proceeding from choler;
and the juice taken in drink, or the deception in ale, gently performeth the fame.
Ttis goodagainfl the fallingficknefs, and jaundice; and a drachm given in oxym el,
after ufing a little exercife, provoketh urine, and expelleth the gravel from the reins
and kid n eys; alfo it helpeth the fciatica, cholic, and pains o f the belly. T h e people

T ime. This herb bringethforch its fpiky tops and feed, together with its leaves,
in June and July.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . It is a plant o f M ars, and the root is hot and dry
in the third degree. T h e roots boiled, and the deco<5tion drunk, provoke urine,
bring down the menfes, expel the (tone, and are good for thofe who are trou­
bled with the dropfy; the lame is alfo good for the cough, the fiingings o f fcorpions,
and oicings o f venomous beads. By baching the belly with this deco&ion, it fupples
the hardnefs of the mother, and remediech the ftoppings and coldnels thereof.
T h e fiowder o f the root drieth up and htalcth old running fores o f the mouth and
privities, being wet with wine, and laid thereon; and is an excellent ingreuient for
hot ointments and maturative plaflers. Pliny fays, chat the feed o f galingal drunk
with water ftoppech the flux o f the belly, and the immoderate floodings o f the men-
ftrua; but thegreateft caie m ult be taken in ufing it, as too great a quantity will
caufe a violent head-ach.

leaves are w hite; the leaves o f the flowers are o f various colours, and called by fbmc
writers viola matroniales, or dame’s violets.
D escription. Thefe two plants are not much unlike the wall-flowers, but that
their leaves are whiter and fofrer * however, I fhall treat o f them refpettively.
T h e great cattle or dock gilliflower beareth hard and ftraight leaves, about two

D e sc r ip t io n . T h e yellow wall gilliflower is green both winter and fummer j
the ftatks thereof are h aid, and o f a woody fubftance, and full o f branches; the
leaves are thick fet thereon, long, narrow, and green ; on the tops o f the ftalks
grow the flowers, which are o f a very fair yellow colour, o f a ftrong but pleafant
fm ell, and every flower is divided into four fmall leaves; after thefeare paft, thcie
come cods or hufks, which contain large, flat, and yellow ,feed.
P lace. It grows in great quantities on the ruined walls of ftone buildings, and
is very often planted in gardens, though the garden kinds are generally double

D escription. T H E ftrong gall-oak fo named from the fruit it bears, doth
not grow fo large nor high as other oaks, but fliortcr and very crooked, with fair
fpreading branches *
, on thefe grow long leaves, very much cut in on the edges,
and hoary underneath; this tree flowereth and beareth acorns, as alfo a round
woody fubftance, which is called a gall, and the timber is o f a very hard fubftance.
There are fcveral kinds o f gall-oaks, feme o f them are much fhorter than others,
bearing leaves more o r lc fs c u to r jagged on the edges, and producing a greater
quantity o f galls, and no acorns at all; fome bear large galls, others fmall, fome
knobbed or bunched, and others fmooch ; each are o f different colours, fome white,
others red, yellow, and green.
P lace. Thefe oaks grow frequently in Italy,*Spain, and other hot countries.
T ime. They fhoot forth their long catkins or bloffomsearly in the fpring, which
fail away for the moft part before the leaves appear. T h e acorns are very feldom
ripe before October.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . I fhall hereexplain the life, virtues, and temper­
ament, o f the galls o f thefe foreign trees only, as their acorns differ but little from
thofe produced by our Englifh oaks.
T h e fmall gall, called ompbacitis, is dry in the third degree, and cold in the fe-
cond; Saturnine, and o f a four harfh nature. It is effectual in drawing together
and faftenirfg loofe and faint par.s, as the overgrowing o f the flefh; it expelleth
and drieth up rheums and ocher fluxes, efpeciatly thofe that fall upon the gums,
almonds o f the throat, and other places o f the mouth.
T h e other whiter gall doth al(o bind and dry, but not fo much as the former,
having a iefs q uantity o f that four ha !hnefs in it, it is good againft the dyfentery or
bloody flux. T h e decottion o f them in water is o f a mean aftridion, but m>re
powerful in harfh'red w ine; being fat over, it renudieth the falling o f the mother,
o r the galls being boi.cd and bruifeJ, and applied to the fundament when fallen, or
to any fwclling or inflammation, will prove a certain cuie. T h e coals o f burned
galls, when quenched in wine or vinegar, are good to (launch bleeding in any place.
T h e y will dye the hair black, and arc one 01 the chief ingredients for m aking in k ;
they are likewife ufed by dyers for making black dye.
T h e oak-apple is much o f the nature o f galls, though inferior in quality, but

over ir, yet its qualities are very harmlcfs. It is very good toftan ch bleedings,either
inwardly or outwardly, the ju ice or decoction thereof being drunk, or externally ap­
plied. It ftays lafks and fluxes o f every kind, either in men or w om en; fupprelTes
the evacuation o f blood through the urinary pafiages, and healeth not only the
inward ulcers and excoriations o f the entrails, bladder, & c . but all other forts o f
foul, moift, and running, ulcers, and quickly healeth green wounds. It is an ex­

G overnment and V irtues. - Jupiter claims dominion over this herb, from
which it is fabuloufly reported, that it preferves whatever it grows upon from Are
and lightning. T h e ordinary houfeleek is good for all inward and outward heats,-
either in the eyes or ocher parts o f the body. A police made with the juice ofhoufe-
leek is Angularly good in all hot agues, for it cooleth and tempereth the blood and
fpirics, and quencheth third; by dropping the ju ice thereof into the eyes, it cureth
them o f all hot defluxions o f Ih arp and fait rheums, and is equally effc&ual for all
diforders o f the ears, being uled in the fame manner. It ftopj>eth the immoderate
floodings of the menftrua, and helpeth the humours o f the bowels; it cooleth and
abated! all hot inflammations, the St. Anthony’s Are, fealdings, burnings, the fliin-
glcs, fretting ulcers, cankers, tetters, ring-worms, an.1 the like *
, and is a certain eafe
to thofe who are affli&ed with the gout, when proceeding from a hot caufe. B y
bathing the hands and feet with the juice, and laying the Ikin o f the leaves on them
afterwards, it cleanfeth them o f warts and corns; it alfo eafeth the head-ach and
diftempered heat o f the brain, occafioned by phrenAes or want o f fleep, being ap­
plied to the temples and forehead. T h e leaves bruifed, and laid upon the crown o f
the head, ftay the bleeding o f the nofe very quickly. T h e diftilled water o f the
herb is likewife profitable for all the aforefaid purpofes. T h e leaves, being gently
rubbed on any place (lung with nettles or bees, do quickly take away the pain, and
difeharge the blifters proceeding therefrom.

expel wind, and are therefore elleemed good for removing the pains o f the ch o lic;
they are o f a ftrong nature; for, by eating a dozen o f them in the morning failing,
when
when they are ripe, and not dried, they purge the body o f grofs and clam m y phlegm;
but, if you dry the berries and beat them into powder, they are binding; they ftop
fluxes o f every kind, as alfo the terms o f women. Both the bark and leaves are ex­
ceeding good to be ufed in fomentations, for broken bones and diflocatcd members.

that are open and expofed to the fun.
T im e . T h ey flower about midfummer, and their feed is ripe in the latter end o f
Ju ly and A ugu ft.
G overnment and V irtues. It is under theceleftial fign Leo,and governed by
the Sun. It is by no means the leaft valuable for its efficacy in the cu reo f wounds,
hurts, or bruifes, by being boiled in wine and drunk, if the complaint is inwardly,
o r, if outwardly, by converting it into an oil, ointment, bath, or lotion. It openeth
obftru&ions, diffolves fweilings, elofes up the lips o f wounds, and ftrengthens the
parts that are weak and feeble. T h e decottion o f the herb and flowers, (though that
o f the feed is preferable,) taken in wine, or the feed made into powder and drunk
w ith the juice o f knot-grafs, helpeth all manner o f vom iting and fpitting o f blood,
occalioned by the burfting o f a vein, bruifes, falls, & c. It likewife helpeth thole

ruinous buildings, and frequently in woods and upon trees.
T im e. It flowererh in July, but the berries do not ripen till they have felt the
winter frofts.
G overnment and V irtu es. It is under the dominion o f Saturn. Diofcorides
recommends about a drachm o f the flowers to be taken twice a day in red wine as
an excellent medicine fo r the lafk and bloody flux. It is very pernicious to the
nerves and finews being taken too liberally, but particularly helpful when exter­
nally applied. Pliny obferves, that the yellow berries are good againft the jaundice,
and help thofe who fpit blood * alfo prevent drunkennefs; and that the white
berries, being either inwardly or outwardly applied, kill the worms in the belly.
T h e fame beaten to powder, and taken in liquor for two or three days together,
admirably help thofe who have the plague, or, taken in wine, break the ftone,
provoke urine, and bring down the menftrua. T h e frefh leaves o f ivy, boiled
in vinegar, and applied warm to the fidesof thofe that are troubled with the fpleen,

rofcs to bathe the temples and forehead, eafe the head-ach, though o f long conti­
nuance. T h e fame, boiled in wine, cleanle and heal old and filthy ulcers, by
ufing it as a w alk; it is likew ifean excellent cure fo r green wounds, burnings,
Icaldings, and all kinds o f exulcerations com ing thereby, or by fait phlegm or hu­
mours in other parts o f the body. T h e juice o f the berries or leaves, fnuffed up the
nofe, purgeth the head and brain o f thin rheum which caufeth defluxions into the
eyes and nofe, and cureth the ulcers and ftench therein $ the fame, dropped into the
•ears, helpeth the old and running fores o f them. By the continual drinking out o f
a cup made o f ivy, all fym ptom s o f the fpleen are entirely erazed. T h e fpeedieft
cure for a furfeit by wine, is to drink a draught o f the fame liquor wherein a hand­
ful o f bruifed ivy-leaves have been boiled.

T im e. T h e berries are not ripe the firft year, but continue green twofum m ers
and one winter before they ripen, when they change their colour to black > they are
ripe about the fall o f the leaf.
G overnment and V irtues. T h is admirable folar (hrub can fcarcely be
equalled for its virtues. Its berries are hot in the third degree, and dry in the firft,
being an excellent counter-poifon and a great refifter o f peftilence; they are very
good for the bitings o f venomous beafts *
, they provoke urine exceedingly, and
therefore are very available in difuries and ftranguaries. It is fo powerful a remedy
for thedropfy, that, by drinking only the lye made o f the afhes o f this herb, it cures
the difeafe; it provokes the terms, helps the fits o f the mother, ftrengthens the (to­
rnach, and expels w :n d ; indeed there are few better remedies for the wind and cho­
lic than the chymical oil drawn from the berries *
, but, as many, in all probability,
would be at a lofs how to extract this oil, I would advife them to eat ten or a dozen
o f the ripe berries every morning fading, asthefe will occafionally anfwer the afore-
faid purpofes; they are alfogood for a cough, (hortnefs o f breath, confumption,
pains in the belly, ruptures, cramps, and convulfions *
, they ftrengthen the brain,
help the memory, fortify the fight by ftrengthening the optic nerves, and give fafe
and fpeedy delivery to women in labour; they are excellent good in all forts o f
agues, they help the gout and fciatica, and ftrengthen all the limbs o f the body.
T h e allies o f the wood are a fpecial remedy for the feurvy in the gum s, by rubbing
them therewith; the berries ftay all fluxes, help the hemorrhoids or piles, and kill
worms in children; they break the (tone, procure loft appetite, and are very good
for palfies and falling ficknefs. A lye m adeof the allies o f the wood, and the body
bathed therewith, cures the itch, fcabs, and leprofy. ..

at the en d ; thefe leaves are fm all, broad, and pointed at the end; finely dented
about the edges, with long veins in them, each (landing on a long footftalk,
fmooth, and feel hard. A t the foot o f every leaf, towards the tops o f the tw igs,
come forth fmall yellowifh flowers, each conflfling o f five leaves; thefe are fuc-
ceeded by the fruit, which is fomewhat like a fmall plum b, or olive, but rather

are long and fall in the earth.
T h e fm allerjujube-tree is in branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit, very much like
the former, except that it is every way fomewhat fm aller; it is alfo thick fet with
thorns like the other, but thefe are rather (horter.
T h e wild jujube-tiee is lower, and more like a (hrub, than either o f the former*
blit thicker fet with fmall (harp thorns; the leaves are not unlike, but grow not fo
thick on a tw ig, and are fm aller; the fruit o f this is alfo red, fomewhat lefs, drier

G overnm ent a n d V irtues. Saturn appears to have dominion over this herb,
though many are o f opinion it is influenced by the Sun. T h e ju ice o f the common
kind o f knot-grafs is very effectual to ftay bleeding at the mouth and nofe, by drink­
ing it in Reeled or red wine for the one, or applied to tHe forehead or fquirted up the
noftrils for the other. It is no lefs effectual to cool and temper the heat o f the blood
and ftomach •, alfo to ftay fluxes o f blood and hum ours, as the laik, bloody flux,
women’s courfes, and running o f the reins. It is a lingular provocative o f urine,
it helps the ftranguary, andallayeth the heat proceeding therefrom ; and, by taking
a drachm o f the powder o f the herb in wine, for feveral days together, it powerfully
expels the gravel or ftone from the kidneys and bladder. Being boiled in wine and
drunk, it healeth the wounds made by the bitings o f venomous creatures, eflre&ually
ftays all defluxions o f rheumatic humours upon the ftom ach, kills the worms in the
belly, and eafes the inward pains that proceed from the heat, fharpnefs, and corrup­
tion ,of blood, and choler. T h e diftilled water o f this herb taken by itfclf, or with the
powder o f the plant or Teed, w ill equally anfwer all the aforefaid purpofes, and is
held in high eftimation for its admirable efficacy in cooling all manner o f inflamma­

ulcers and fores in the privities o feither fex, and all kinds o f frefh and green wounds,

for fore and watery eyes, and for deafnels and pains in the ears, by dropping the

It alfo cleanfeth the lungs and ftomach o'f phlegm, though rather offenfive to the

•with a little fugar, are fometimes taken, in the morning, fafting, to open and purge
the body o f grofs, vifeous, and melancholy, humours. W h at Diofcorides and Theo-
phraftus relate o f this herb is truly wonderful, if not fabulous, viz. that, if women
ufe them, either inwardly or outwardly, for three days together, after conception,
and their menfes be flopped, they fhall bring forth male or female children accor­
ding to the kind o f herb which they ufe. M athiolus faith, that the feed, both o f the
male and female mercury, boiled with wormwood, and drunk, cureth the yellow
jaundice in a fpeedy manner. T h e leaves, or the juice, rubbed upon warts, taketh
them away. T h e juice, m ixed with fome vinegar, helpeth all running fcabs, tet­
ters, ring-worms, and the itch. Galen faith, that being applied, in the manner o f a
poultice, to any fwelling or inflammation, it digefteth the fwelling, and allayeth the
inflammation; and is therefore given in clyfters to evacuate offenfive humours from

ings on horfeback, (a new exercife to her, and therefore over-pleafing,) found her-
felf difappointed at the period o f her expectation j with feverifh heat, pain, fwell-
mg, and, I believe, inflammation. She had been blooded in the fo o t; had taken
penny-royal water; and was entering upon fomething o f more power, when, being
informed by another lady o f the virtues o f this herb, and that the excellent D iof­
corides, a better phyfician than Friend or M ead, advifed the fitting over the fteam
o f a decoction o f it on certain occafions; and that, in this particular cafe, that way
feerned in every fenfc moft proper. A pound o f m ugw ort was boiled in two gallons
o f w ater; the whole was put together into a pan ; and, when the vapour was not too
hot to be borne, the lady fat over it. It was done at n ig h t; and, before morning,
all was well and happy.

They have a regular root, a ftalk confiding of fcveral arrangements of fibres, the
interfaces of which are filled up wich a parenchymatous fubftance, lcadingfrom the
root to the head or umbel; the under-fide of this umbel is full of lamellae, or chives,
every oneofwhich is a regular pod, or fced-veflel. If thefe lamellaeare examined in
theirfeveral dates, the feeds in them may be eafily difeovered, and are always found
to beof a fize and degree of maturity proportioned to the date of the plant at the
time. . They have each of them alfo a filiquaceous aperture leogthwife, the feeds
lying in rows ready to fall through it. The plant is eafily and regularly propagated
through thefe, and not only may be raifed from feed, but, like many other plants,
may be propagated by roots * feveral filaments at the root producing tubercles, in
the manner of the potatoe, from each of which there will arife new roots and a new
plant. The periods of vegetation in this plant are alfo fufficiently regular; and the
common opinion, of its fpringing up in a night and perifhing in aday, has no foun­
dation in reality ; for, in the common way of raifingthemon hot-beds, it is eafy to
find, that they often dand a fortnight or longer, from their firft appearance, before
they are fit for the table.
M r. Bradley mentions an hundred kinds o f muflirooms which he has fcen in E n g­
land, befides thofe very numerous fmall ones which conditute the mouldinefs o f li­

each, and were as yellow as gold. Per. Imperatus tells us, he faw feme which
weighed above one hundred pounds apiece; and the Journal des S$avan$ furnifhes
us with an account o f fome, growing on the frontiers o f H ungary, which made a
full cart load.
T h e poifon o f muflirooms has been much talked o f by feveral perfons j but there

common mufhroom 5 though there are perhaps fome kinds o f them that are truly
poifonous. T h e ancients have taken great pains to dittinguifh the feveral kinds o f
them , that the world might know the hurtful from the fafe. T h e boletos, men­
tioned by Juvenal, on account o f the death o f Claudius, is fufficiently defcribed by
P lin y. Clulius, among the moderns, has defcribed a vaft number o f different fpe-
cies, every wnere dittinguifhing theefculent and wholefome from the poifonous and
pernicious kinds. T h e feveral authors who have treated o f them fince the time o f
C lulius, have all mentioned the effetts o f fome or other o f the poifonous kinds, and
there are numerous inftances o f che mifchief done by them at one time or other.
T h e true eatable mufhroofn is diftinguifhed from the poifonous and unpleafant
kinds by theie m arks: When young, it appears o f a round ilk form, like a button,
the fta)k as well as the button being white, and the flcfhy part very white when
broken, the gills within being livid. A s they grow larger, they expand their heads
by degrees into a flat form, and the gills underneath are o f a pale flefli colour j but,

call them, f which are of the lame genus with the mufhroom,) to cure pains. T h ey ,
Collett ihelargeft tungufes which they find on the bark o f beech and other large
trees, and dry them for ufe. Whenever they have pains in their limbs, they ufe
fome o f this dry matter ; pulling it to pieces with their fingers, they lay a fmall heap
o f it on the part neared to where the pain is fituated, and let ic on fire. In burning
away, it blitters up the part, anJ the water difeharged thereby generally carriesoff
the pain. It is a ccarfe and rough method, but generally a very fuccefsful one,
especially when the patient has prudence enough to apply it in time, and refolution
enough to bear the burning to a nectflary degree.

brim into four fegments ; it has two fhorc ftamina, terminated by ere£t fum m its,
and a roundifh germ en, fupporting a fhorc tingle ftyle, crowned by a thick bifid
ftigm a; the germen afterwards turns to an oval fmooth fruit, or berry, with one
cell, inclofing an oblong oval nut. In Languedoc and Provence, where the olive-
tree is greatly cultivated, they propagate it by truncheons fplit from the roots o f the
trees; for, as thefe trees are frequently hurt by hard frofts in winter, fo, when the
tops are killed, they fend up feveral ftalks from the ro o t; and, when thefe are
grown pretty ftrong, th ey feparate them with an axe from the root; in the doing o f
which they are careful to preferve a few roots to the truncheons; thefe are cut o ff in
the fpring after the danger o f the froft is over, and planted about two feet deep in
the ground. T h efe trees will grow in alm oft any fo il; but, when planted in rich
m oill ground, they grow larger, and make a finer appearance, than in poor lan d;
but the fruit is o f lefs efteem, becaufe the oil made from it is not fo good as that
which is produced in a leaner fo il; chalky ground is efteemed beft for th em ; and
the oil, made from the trees grow ing in that fort o f land, is much finer, and w ill
keep longer, than the other. In England, the plants are only preferved by way o f
curiofity, and are placed in winter in the green-houfe for variety.
2. Olcafler, the wild olive-tree, groweth fomewhat like unco the manured, but
it hath harder and fm aller leaves, and thicker fet on the branches, with fundry (harp
thorns among the leaves; the bloffoms and fruit com e forth in the fame manner as
the other do, and in as great plenty, but m uch fm aller, and fcarce com ing at any

time to ripenefs where they naturally grow j but, where they do become ripe, they
are fmall, with crooked points, and black. O f the olives hereof oil is fometimes
made, which is colder and more aftringent than the other, and harlher in tafte and
grcenifli in c o lo u r; but the olives are much refpefked, and gathered to be eaten.
P l a c e a n d T i m e . Both kinds o f olives grow in the hot countries only ; in any
cold climate, they will never bear fruit, nor hardly endure a winter \ the manured is
planted where it groweth, and, according to the nature o f the foil or climate, pro-
duceth larger or fmaller olives, and in more or lefs plenty ; and oil Tweeter or more
ftrong in cafte. T h e fined and fweeteft oil comes from the ifles in the Mediterranean
fca, as Zante, Cerigo, & c . that from M ajorca, & c . is more full and fat j the oil
from Provence, in France, is ftrongcrand hotter tailed. T h e wild olives grow na­
turally in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and many other countries. T h ey flower in June
and July, but their fruit is not ripe until Novem ber or Decem ber.
G overnment and V itues. T h e olive-tree is a planeof Venus, and o f gentle
temperature. T h e green leaves and branches o f the olive-tree, but much more o f
the wild olive, do cool and bind ; and the ju ice thereof, mixed with vinegar, is
peculiarly ferviccable in all hot impoflhumcs, inflammations, fwcllings, St. A n ­
thony’s fire, fretting or creeping ulcers, and cankers in the flefh or mouth. T h e
fame alfo llayeth the bleeding o f wounds, being applied to the p lace; the faid ju ice
being dropped into the eyes flayeth the diftillation o f hot rheums Into them, and
cleareth the fight from films or clouds that offend the light, or any ulcer that doth
breed therein, or ulcers in the ears.
Pickled olives do dir up an appetite to meat, and, although they be hard o f di-
geftion, yet are pleafing to the ftomach, being apt to putrefy therein ; they are not
good for the eye-fight, and caufe the head-ach; if they be dried, and applied to
fretting and corroding ulcers, they flop their progrefs, and heal them ; and take
away the fears o f carbuncles,, or plague-fores. T h e pickled olives burned, beaten,
and applied unto wheals, (lop their further increafe, and hinder them from rifin g;
they cleanie foul ulcers, help gum s that are fpungy, and fallen loofe teeth.
T h e water, that istaken from the green wood when heated in the fire, healeth the
feurf or fcab in the head, o r other parts *
, the olive-lloncs, being burned, are ufed
for the fame purpofes, and alio to heal foul fpreading ulcers *
, and, being m ixed with
fat and meal, they takeaway the ruggednefs o f the nails.
T h e other properties o f theolive are contained in the o il, and the foot or bottom
o f the tree. Firft, the oil has divers and variable virtues, according to the ripenefs
or unripenefs o f the fruit w hereof it is made, and then o f the time and age thereof,
and
278 C U L P E P E R ’ S E N G L I S H P H Y S I C I A N ,
and o f the walhing it from the fait wherewith foine o f it is made. T h e oil that is
made o f unripe olives is more cooling and binding than that which is made o f thofe
that are ripe •
, which, when it is frefh and new, is moderately heating and moiften-
in g : but, if it be old, it hath a ftronger force to warm and difeufs, which properties
are perceivable by its fw m n e fs ; for, if the oil be harfb, it is more cooling than
w arm ing! and, if that oil bew afhed, it taketh from it allharfhnefs.
T h e green oil o f unripe olives, while it is frefh, is m oft welcome to the ftomach ;
it ftrengtheneth the gum s, and fafteneth the teeth, i f it be held in the mouth for
any tim e *
, and, being drunk, it preventeth too great a perfpiration in thofe who are
fubjeft thereunto. T h e fweet oil is o f m oft ufe in fallads, & c . being moft pleafing
to the ftomach and tafte; b u t the older the oil is, the better it is for medicine, both
to warm any part, and difeufs an yth in g where n eed fu l; and to open and m ove the
belly downwards -
>and is m oft effectual againft all poifons, efpecialiy thole that ex-
ulcerate the inteftines, or, not having palled down fo lo w , irritate the ftom ach; the
o il either bringing it up by vom iting, or at lead hindering its m alignity from fpread-
ing. It is alfo a principal ingredient in alm oft all falves, helping as well the form
as the virtue thereof.
T h e foot, or dregs o f the oil, the older it is, is the better for various purpofes, as
to heal the fcab in man or beaft, being ufed with the decoction o f lupines. It is very
profitably ufed for ulcers o f the fundam ent or privy parts, when mixed with honey,
wine, and vin egar; ithealeth wounds, andhelpeththetooth-ach being held in the
m outh ; if it be boiled in a copper veflel to the thicknefs o f honey, it bindeth m uch
and is effectual for all the purpofes for which lycinus may be ufed ; if it be boiled
with the ju ice o f unripe grapes to the thicknefs o f honey, and applied to the teeth,
it will caufe them to fall out.

K inds and N ames. O f oranges we lhall deferibe five kinds or forts. T h efe
apples were called by the ancients mala aurea Hefperidum, the golden apples o f H e f-
perides; and therefore H ercules made it one o f his labours to kill the dragon that
kept the garden where they were, and to bring them away with him. T h e flowers
o f the orange-tree are called napha; and the ointment that is made o f them ungutntutn
ex napha. Oranges are now generally called aurantia.

4. T h e orange without feeds, toalus aurantia, unico grand. T h is only difiereth
from that orange which has the belt four ju ice, in having but one grain or feed in

5. T h e dw arf orange-tree, mains aurantiapumilio. T h e (lock o f this dwarf-tree is
low , and the branches grow thick, well ftored with leaves, but they are fmaller and
narrower than the other; the flowers alfo are many, and thick fet on the branches,
which bear fruit more plentifully than the former, though o f a fmaller lize, yet
equally well-coloured.
Place and T ime. A ll thefe forts o f oranges, as well as the lemons and citrons,
are brought unto us from Spain and P ortu gal; they hold time with the lemons,
having their leaves always green, with green bloffoms and ripe fruit conllantly to­

G overnment and V irtues. A ll thefe trees and fruits are governed by Jupiter.
T h e fruit is o f different parts and qualities; the rind o f the oranges is more bitter
and hot than thofe o f the lemons or citrons, and are therefore preferable to warm a
cold ftomach, breaking the wind and cutting the phlegm therein ; after the bitter-

Government and Virtues. Venus owns this tree, and by it oppofeth the ill
effects o f M ars. N othing is better to purge choler and the jaundice in children
and young people, than the leaves o f this tree made into a lyrup or conlcrve, o f
which two Ipoontuls at a time may l'afcly be taken. T h e leaves o f peaches, bruifed

T h e kernels o f the Hones do wonderfully eafe the pains and wringings o f the belly,

C O M M O N pellitory o f Spain, if planted in gardens, thrives very well In this
kingdom . There is a fort, growing wild in this country, which is very little, i f at

D escription. Pellitory is a very common plant, yec muH be diligently looked
after to be brought to perfe&ion. T h e root goes downright into the ground, bear­

than the leaves o f camomile are* at the top it bears one fingle large Bower at a place,
having a border o f many leaves, white on the upper fide, and reddtJh underneath,
with a yellow thrum in the middle, not Handing fo clofe as that o f camomile.
T h e other common pellitory, which groweth here fpontaneoufly, hath a root o f a
frarp biting tafie, fcarcely difcernable by the tafte from that before deferibed, from
whence arife divers brittle ttalks, more than a yard high, with narrow long leaves,
finely dented about the edges, Handing one above another up to the top. T h e

D escription. T H E R E are two forts o f poplars which are very fam iliar with
us, viz. the white and the black : T h e white fort groweth large, and tolerably high,
covered with a fmooth, thick, white, bark, efpecially the branches, having large
leaves cut into feveral divifions, almoft like a vine-leaf, but not o f fo deep a green
on the upper fide, and hoary white underneath, o f a good feent, the whole repre-
fenting the form o f coltsfoot. T h e catkins, which it bringeth forth before the
leaves, are long, o f a faint reddifh colour, which fall away, and but feldom bear
good feed with them. T h e w ood thereof is fm ooth, foft, and white, very finely
w aved, whereby it is m uch efteemed.
T h e black poplar groweth higher and ftraiter than th e white, with a greyifli bark,
bearing broad and green leaves fomewhat like ivy leaves, not cut in on the edges
like
like the white, but whole and dented, ending in a point, and not white underneath,
hanging by (lender long foot-ftalks, which, with the air, are continually fhaken as
the afpen-leaves are. T h e catkins hereof are greater than o f the white, compofed o f
many round green berries, as it were fet together in a long clufter, containing much
downy matter, which, on being ripe, is blown away with the wind. T h e clammy
buds hereof, before they are fpread into leaves, are gathered to m ake the unguentwn
fopukon, and are o f a yellowifh green colour, and fm all, fomewhat fweer, but ftrong.
T h e wood is fmooth, tough, and white, and eafy to be cloven. On both thefe trees
groweth afweet kind o f m ufk, which formerly ufed to be put into fweet ointments.
P lace. T h ey grow in moift woods, and by the water-fide, in all parts o f the
kingdom \ but the white fort is not fo frequently to be met with as the other.
T i m e . T h ey are in leaf at the end o f fummer, but the catkins come before the
leaves, as above-mentioned.
Government and Virtues. Saturn hath dominion over both. T h e white pop­
lar, faith Galen, pofTefles a cleanfing property; one ounce in powder o f the bark
thereof, being drunk, faith Diofcorides, is a remedy for thofe that are troubled
with.xhe fciatica or the ftranguary. T h e juice o f the leaves, dropped warm into-
the ears, eafeth the pains thereof. T h e young clammy buds or eyes, before they
break out into leaves, bruifed, and a little honey put to them , are a good medicine
for a dull fight. T h e black poplar is held to be more cooling than the white, and
therefore the leaves bruifed with vinegar, and applied, help the gout. T h e feed,
drunk in vinegar, is held good againft the falling ficknefs. T h e water, that drop*
peth from the hollow places o f this tree, taketh away warts, pufhes, wheals, and
other out-breakings in the body. T h e young black poplar buds, faith M athiolus,
are much ufed by women to beautify their hair, bruifing them with frelh b u tte r,.
and (training them after they have been kept for (bme time in the fun. T h e oint­
ment called populeon, which is made o f this poplar, is Angularly good for all heat,
and inflammation in any part o f the body, and tempereth the heat o f wounds. It
is much ufed to dry up the m ilk in women’s breads, when they have weaned their
children.

O F thefe there are three kinds, viz. the white and black o f the garden, and the-,
erratic wild poppy, or corn-rofe.

lying upon the ground, which rife with the ftalk, compaffing it at the bottom o f
them-v

them, and are very large, m uch cut or torn in on the edges, and dented alfo. T h e
ftalk, which is ufually four or five feet high, hath fometimes no branches at the top,
and ufually but two or three at moll:, bearing but one head, each wrapped in a thin
fkin, which boweth down before it be ready to blow , and then, rifing and being
broken, the flower within it fpreadeth itfelf open, and confifteth o f four very large
round white leaves, with many whitifli round threads in the middle, fet about a fmall
round green head, having a crown, or ftar-like cover at the head thereof, which,
grow ing ripe, becometh as large as a great apple, wherein are contained a great num­
ber o f fmall round feed, in feveral partitions or divifions next unto the Ihell, the
m iddle thereof remaining hollow and em pty. AH the whole plant, leaves, ftalks,
and heads, while they are frefti, young, and green, yield a m ilk, when they are
broken, o f an unpleafant bitter tafte, almoft ready to provoke puking, and o f a
ftrong heady fm ell, which, being condenfed, is called opium . T h e root is white and
woody, perifhing as foon as it hath given ripe feed.
T h e black poppy differeth but little from the form er, until it beareth its flower,
which is fomewhat lefs, and o f a black purplifh colour, but without any purple fpots
in the bottom o f the leaf. T h e head o f feed is much lefs than the former, and open-
eth itfelf a little round about the top, under the crown, fo th a t the feed, which is very
black, w ill fall out, if the head is turned downwards.
T h e wild poppy, or corn rofc, hath long and narrow leaves, very much cut inon
the edges into many divifions, o f a light green colour, and fometimes hairy w ithal:
the (talk is blackifh and hairy alfo, but not fo tall as the garden kinds, having
fome fuch like leaves thereon as grow below, parted into three or four branches
fometimes, whereon grow fm all hairy heads, bowing down before the skin breaks
wherein the flower is inclofed, w hich, when it is full-blow n, is o f a fair yellowifli
red or crim fon colour, and in fome m uch paler, without any fpot in the bottom o f
the leaves, having many black foft fpots in the m iddle, compafling a fmall green
head, which, when it is ripe, is no larger than one’s little Anger end, wherein is
contained much black feed, fmaller by h alf than that o f the garden. T h e root
perilheth every year, and fpringeth again of its own fowing. O f this kind there is
one fmaller in all the parts thereof, but differeth in nothing elfe.
P la ce. T h e garden kinds do not naturally grow w ild in any place, but are all
Town in gardens, where they grow. T h e wild poppy, or corn-rofe, is plentiful
enough, and many times too m uch fo, in the corn fields in all parts o f the kingdom ,
alfo upon the banks o f ditches and by hedge-fides. T h e fmaller wild kind is alfo to
be met with in thofe places, though not fo plentifully as the former.
i T i m e .
T ime. T h e garden kinds are ufually Town in the fpring, which then flower about
the end o f M ay, and fomewhat earlier, if they are o f their own fowing. T h e wild
kinds ufually flower from M ay until Ju ly, and the feed o f them is ripe foon after
their flowering.
G overnment an dV irtu es. T h e herb is lunar, and the ju ice o f it is made into
opium . T h e garden poppy heads, with the feed, made iqto a fyrup, are frequently,
and togood effect, ufed to procure reft and deep to the fickan d weak, and to ftay
catarrhs and defluxions o f hot thin rheums from the head into the ftomach, and
upon the lungs, caufing a continual cough, the fore-runner o f aconfum ption; it
helpeth alfo hoarfenefsof the throat, and when a perfon hath loft the power o f arti­
culation *
, for all which complaints the oil o f the feed is alfo a good remedy. T h e
b lack feed, boiled in wine and drunk, is alfo faid to ftay the flux o f the belly, and
the menies. T h e empty fhells o f the poppy heads are ufually boiled in water, and
given to procure fleep * the leaves likewife, when fo boiled, polTefs the fame virtue.
I f the head and temples be bathed with the deco&ion warm , the oil o f poppies, the
green leaves or heads bruifed and applied with a little vinegar, or made into a poul­
tice with barley-meal, or hog’s greafe, it cooleth and tempereth all inflammations,
as alfo the difeafe called St. Anthony’s fire. It is generally ufed in treacle and rm-
thridate, and in all other medicines that are ufed to procure reft and fleep, and to
cafe pains in the head, as well as in other parts. It ia alfo ufed to cool inflamma­
tions, agues, orphrenfles, and to ftay defluxions which caufe a cough or confump-
tion, and alfo otherftuxes o f the belly : It is frequently put into hollow teeth to eafe
the pain thereof, and hath been found by experience to help gouty pains.
T h e wild poppy, orcorn rofe, M athiolus faith, is good to prevent the falling
ficknefs. T h e fyrup made with the flowers is given with good effeft to thofe that
have the pleurify *
, and the dried flowers alfo, either boiled in water, or made into
powder, and drunk, either in the diftilled water o f them, or in fome other drink,
•work the like effect. T h e diftilled water o f the flowers is held to be o f m uch
good ufe againft furfeits, being drunk evening and m orning; it is alfo more cool­
in g than any o f the other poppies, and therefore cannot but be as effectual in hot
agues, phrenfies, and other inflammations, whether external or internal, the fyrup
o r water to be ufed inwardly, and the green leaves outwardly, either in an ointment
or any other convenient manner in which it can be applied. Galen faith, the feed
is dangerous to be ufed inwardly.

G o vern m ent and V irtues. T h is is an herb o f the moon. I t is good to cool
any heat in the liver, blood, reins, and ftom ach, and, in hot agues, nothing better
can be adminiftered 5 it ftayeth hot and choleric fluxes o f the belly, the menfes,
fluor albus, gonorrhea, and running o f the reins *
, alfo diftillations from the head,
and pains therein proceeding from heat, want o f fleep, or the phrenfy. T h e feed is
more effectual than the herb, and is Angularly nfeful in cooling the heat and lharp-
nefs o f the urine, luft, venerious dreams, and the lik e , infomuch that the over fre­
quent ufe o f it extinguifheth the heat and virtue o f natural procreation. T h e feed,
bruifed and boiled in w ine, and given to children, expelleth worms. T h e ju ice o f
the herb is held equally effectual for all the purpofes aforefaid; as alfo to flay vom it­
in gs; taken with fome fugar or honey, it helpeth an old dry cough, fhortnefs o f
breath, and th ep h th yfic, and ftayeth immoderate thirft. T h e diftilled water o f the
herb is ufed by many, being more palatable, with a little fugar, to produce the fame
effects. T h e ju ice alfo is good in ulcers and inflammations o f the fecretparts, like-
wife o f the bowels, and hemorrhoids when they are ulcerous, or have excoriations in
them . T h e herb, bruifed, and applied to the forehead and tem ples, allayeth excef-
five heat therein, hindering reft and fleep ; and, applied to the eyes, taketh away the
rednefs and inflammation in them , and thofe other parts where puflies, wheals, pim ­
ples, St. A nthony’s fire, and the like, break forth, efpecially if a little vinegar be put
to it 5 and being applied to the neck, with equal quantities o f galls and linfeed to g e­
ther, taketh away all pain therefrom , and what is term ed the crick in the n eck.
T h e ju ice is alfo ufed w ith oil o f rofes for the above purpofes, for blafts by ligh t­
ning, and burns by gunpow der, or for women’s fore breads, and to allay heat in
all other fores or hurts. A p p lied alfo to the navels o f children that are too prominent,
it reduceth them. It is likew ife good for fore m ouths, and gum s that are fwelled, as
well as to fatten loofe teeth. Camerarius faith, that the diftilled water cured the
tooth-ach when all other remedies failed, and that the thickened ju ice, made into
pills with the powders o f gum tragacanth and arabic, being taken, greatly relieveth
thofe that m ake bloody -water. A pplied to the go u t, it eafeth pains thereof, and
helpeth hardnefs o f the finews, if not arifin gfro m th ecram p ,o ra cold caufe. T h is

white flowers in tufts at the ends o f the branches, which turn intofm all blackberries
that have a purplifh ju ice within them, and fome feeds that are flat on the one fide,
with a hole or dent therein.
P lace. It groweth in divers woods in Great Britain.
T ime. T h e privet flowereth in June and July, and the berries are ripe in A u gu ft
and September.
G overnment and V irtues. It is under the influence o f the moon, and is but
little ufed in phyfic in thefe times, except in lotions to wafh fores and fore mouths,
and to cool inflammations and dry up fluxes •, yet M athiolus faith, it ferveth every
purpofe for which the cyprefs tree, or oriental privet, is approved o f by Diofcorides
and Galen. H e further faith, that the oil extracted from the flowers o f privet
by infufion, and fet in the fun, is very lerviceable in inflammatory wounds,
and for the head-ach when arifm g from a hot caufe. T h ere is a fweet water alfo dif-
tilled from the flowers, which is good for all thofe difeafes that require cooling and
drying, and therefore helpeth all fluxes o f the belly or ftom ach, bloody fluxes, and
women’s courfes, being either drunk, or otherwife applied *
, as alfo for thofe that
void blood at their mouth or at any other place; likcw ife for diltillations o f rheums
in the eyes, efpecially if it be ufed with tutty.

T H E R E are three kinds o f pomecitrons. T h e tree is generally called malus
medica, velcitria.
D e s c r i p t i o n , i . Thegreaterpom ecitrontree, or malus citria major. T h is tree
. doth not grow very, high in fom e places, bqt rather with a fhort crooked body, and
in
in others not much lower than the lemon- tree, fpreading out into fundry great long
arms and branches ♦, fet w ith long and fliarp thorns, and fair, large, and broad, frefh
green leaves, a little dented about the edges, with a ihew o f almoft invifible holes in
them , but lefs than the orange-leaves h ave; o f a very fweet feent, the flowers green
at the leaves, all along the branches, being fomewhat longer than thofe o f the
orange ; made o f five th ick , whicifb, purple, or bluifti, leaves, with fome threads
in the middle, after which followeth fruit all the year, being feldom feen w ithout
ripe fruit, and half-ripe, and fome young and green, and blofloms, all at once-
T h is kin d beareth great and large fruit, fome the flze o f a m ufk melon, others lefs,
but all o f them with a rugged, bunched-our, and uneven, yellow bark, thicker
than in any o f the other forts, with a four ju ice in the m iddle, and fomewhat great,
pale, whitifh, or yellow, feed, with a bitter kernel lying in i t ; the fmell o f this
fruit is very itrong and com fortable to the fenfes.
2. T h e fmaller pomecitron tree, citria mains minor,Jive limomra ; this tree groweth
very like the former, but the leaves are fomewhat fmaller and fliorter, and fo are
the thornsi the flowers are o f a deep bluflh colour, and the fruit lefs and longer
than they, but no larger than the fmall fruit o f the fo rm er; the rind is alfo th ick
and yellow, but not (6 rugged, having more four ju ice and fewer feeds.
3. Citria malm,five limomrapregnant. T h is differs very little from the foregoing.
P lace a n d T im e . All thefe fores of citrons are cultivated in Spain, by the
curious, but were tranfjorted thither from fundry places abroad. T h e great pome-
citron was brought iirft from M edia and Perfia, and was therefore called malum
Mcdtcum and malum Perftcum. T h e laft was brought from the fortunate iflands. T h e y
are continually in flower and bear fruit throughout the year.
G overnment and V irtues. Thefe are folar plants, yet they are o f different
qualities; all the parts o f the fruit hereof, both the outer and inner rind, as well as
the ju ice and feed, are o f excellent ufe, though o f contrary effects one to another ;
fom e being hot and d ry , whilft others are cold and dry ; the outer yellow rind is
very fweet in fm ell, highly aromatic and bitter in ta fte; and, dried, is a fovereign
cordial for the heart, and an excellent antidote againft venom and poifon in cafes o f
the plague or any other infection ; it warmeth and com forteth a cold and windy fto-
m ach, and difperfeth cold , raw, and undigefted, humours therein, or in the bowels,
and m ightily expelleth wind: Being chewed in the m outh, it helpeth a {linking
breath it alfo helps digeftion, and is good againft m elancholy. T h e outer rinds
are often ufed in cordial electuaries, and prefervatives againft infection and melan-
holy. It alfo helpeth to loofen the body, and therefore there is a folutive electuary
2 made
made therewith, called ekclucrium de eurofolulrjwn^ to evacuate the bodies o f cold
phlegmatic conftitutions, andm ayfafely be ufed where choier is mixed with phlegm.
T h e inner white rind o f this fruit is rather unfavoury, altnoii without cafie, and is
not ufed in phyfic. T h e four ju ice in the middle is cold, and far furpaficth that o f
lemons in its effects, although not fo fliarp in tafte. lc is Angularly good, in all
peftilential and burning fevers, to reftrain the venom and infection, to fupprefsthe
cnoler and hot diftem perof the blood, and to quench th ir l!; and corretttth the
bad difpofitioh o f the liver. It fUrs up an appetite, and refrelhes the over-fpent
and fainting fpirits: refifteth drunkennefs, and hclpeth giddinefs o f the head, by
the hot vapours arifing therein, which caufeth a phrenzy for want o f fkep. T h e
Iced not only equalled) the rind in its virtues, but in many inftances furpaficth it.

K inds and N ames. T H E R E are feveral forts o f pepper, as black, white,
and long, pepper called piper nigrum, album, et longum. T h e black, and white,
pepper, differ not either in manner o f growing, or in form o f leaf or fruit. T h e
long pepper alfo grows in the fame manner, but differed) in the fruit. A ll thefe
forts grow on aclim bing bufh, in the Eaft Indies, after one manner, that is, as
hops grow with us ; fo that, if they be not fufta'med by fomc tree or (>ole, on which
they may clim b and fpread, they will lie down on the ground, and thereon run, and
fhoot forth fmall fibres at every joint. B ut the ufual manner is to plant a branch
taken from the bufii, near fome tall tree^ great cane, or pole, and fo it will quickly,
b y winding itfelf about fuch. props, get to the top thereof; being full o f joints, and
{hooting forth fair, large, leaves, one at each joint, being almoft round, but end­
in g in a point, green above, and paler underneath, with a great middle rib, and
four other ribs, fomewhat lefs, fpreading from it, two on each fide, and fmaller
therein alfo, unto the edges, which are fmooth and plain, fomewhat thin, and fee
on a pretty long foot-ftalk. T h e fruit, or pepper, whether black, white, or long,
groweth at the fame joint, but on the contrary fide, oppofue to the leaf, round
about a long (talk, fomewhat thinly foe all along thereon, or not fo clofe as a bunch
o f grapes j the root hath fundry joints creeping in the ground, with fibres at the
joints. T h e white pepper is hardly diftinguifhable from the black, by the plants
thereof, until it becomes ripe, (for the white and black pepper grow on different
bufhes,) but that the leaves are o f a little paler green colour, and the grains or ber­
ries are white, folid, firm, without wrinkles, and more aromatic. T h e long pep­
per hath leaves o f very near the fame form and fize, but a little longer pointed, o f
N o. 21. 4 K a paler

a paler green colour, thinner alfo, and with a Ihorter foot-ftalk, but four or five
ribs fometimes on each fide, according to the iargenefs o f the leaf, with other
fm aller veins therein, and has lefs acrimony and hot tafte than the black* T h e
fruit o f this alfo groweth in like manner at the joints, oppofice to each leaf, which
are clofer fet together than in the black, confifting o f many finall grains as* it were
fet clofe together in rows, and not open and leparate as in the black and white
pepper; o f an a(h colour when it is ripe.
G over nme nt and V irtues. A ll the peppers are under the dominion o fM a rs ,
and o f temperature hot and dry almoft in the fourth degree, but the white pepper
is the hottcft ; which fort is much ufed by the Indians, many o f whom ufe the
leaves as Europeans do tobacco •, and even the pepper icfelf they alfo chew, taking
from the branch one grain after another, while they are frefh.
Pepper is much ufed with us in meats and fauces, com forteth and warmeth a cold
ftom ach, confumeth crude and moift humours therein, and ftirreth up the appetite ;
It helpeth to break or difiblve wind in the ftomach or bowels, to provoke urine, to
help the cough and other difeafes o f the breaft, and is effectual againft the bitings o f
ferpents and other poifons, and to that purpofe it is an ingredient in the great anti­
dotes : but the white pepper, as being more fharp and aromatical, is o f more effect
in medicine j and fo is the long, being more ufed to be given for agues to warm the
ftom ach before the com ing o f the fit, thereby to abate th efh akin g thereof. A ll o f
them are ufed againft the quinfey, being mixed with honey, and taken inwardly and
applied outwardly, and dilperfe the kernels, as well in the throat as in any other
parts o f the body.
M athiolus m aketh mention o f a kind o f pepper, which he calleth piper Mtbiopicum,
brought with other merchandize from A lexandria into Italy, and groweth in long
cods like beans or peafe 5 but many cods fet together at a place, whofe grains within
them, being like pepper both in form and tafte, but fm aller, flick very clofe to the
infide : this fortSerapio calleth granum zelin.
M onardusalfo m aketh mention o f a kind o f long pepper, that groweth in all the
tra il o f the continent o f the W eft Indies. T h is kind o f pepper is h alf a foot long,
and o f th cth ickn efso f afmaU rope, confifting o f many rows o f fmall grains, fet clofe
together as in the head o f plantane, and is black when ripe j and hotter in tafte, and
more aromatical and pleafant, than capficum , and preferred before black pepper, and
groweth (fays he) on high trees or plants.

There are nineteen other forts o f Guinea pepper, all which, except the undermen­

round dalks, fet full o f white hairs, contrary to all other fo rts5 at the branches come
forth
forth twofuch leaves as the beforementionedone hath, b u t rather larger; the flowers
are white, confifting o f five leaves like the reft, which are likewife larger ; after which
com e the cods, green at firft, and, when ripe, red, like the reft, which are fome-
what great and long, ending in a very long p oint; not differing from the former forts
in the feed and roots.
P lace and T im e. A ll theft forts o f pepper came from the W eft Indies, called
A m erica, and the fcveral parts thereof, Braid being reckoned as a part o f it, and
our S ummer I(lands aUo; but here in England (though erroneoufly) we give it the
name o f Guinea pepper, as though it originally came from thence. T n ey a re r.ow
railed in gardens in all the provinces o f Euroj>e, excepting in very cold countries,
and grow in many places o f Italy, Spain, & c.
T h e y do not fow them in hot countries before the end o f M arch or beginning o f
A p ril, and at the fooneft they do not flower before A u g u ft follow ing, and their red
cods ripen not thoroughly until N ovem ber, when they w ill continue both with
flower and fruit m od o f the winter, where the weather is not very intenfe; but in
very cold climates they perifh with the firft frolt ; and therefore muft be carefully
houfed, if any w ill preferve them.
G overnment and Vir t u e s . A ll thefe forts o f pepper areunder M ars, and are
o f a fiery, hot, and fharp, biting, tafte, and o f temperature hot and dry to the end
o f the fourth degree; they burn and inflame the mouth and throat fo extremely, that
it is hard to be endured ; and, if it be outwardly applied to the (kin in any part o f the
body, it will exulcerate and raifo it as if it had been burnt with fire orfealded with hot
water. T h e vapours thatarife from the hulks or cods, while one doth but open them
to take out the feed, (efpecially if they beat them into powder, or bruife them,) will
fo pierce the brain, by flying up into the head through the noftrils, as to procure
violent fneezings, and draw down abundance o f chin rheum, forcing tears from the
eyes, and will all pafs into the throat, and provoke a fharp coughing, and cauft vio­
lent vom itin g; and, if any (hall with their hands touch their face or eyes, it will caufe
fo great an inflammation, that it will not be remedied in a long time, by all the bathing
thereof with wine or cold water that can be ufed, but yet will pafs away without fur­
ther harm. I f any o f it b e ca ft into fire, it raifeth grievous ftrong and noifome va­
pours, occafioneth fneezing, coughing, and ftrong vom iting, to all that be near it j
if it fhould be taken fim ply o fitfe lf, (though in a very fmall quantity, either in
powder ordeco& ion,) it w ould be hard to endure, and m ight prove dangerous to life.

Preparation ofthe Guinea Pepper.
T a k e the ripe cods o f any fort o f the Guinea pepper, (fo r they are in property all
alike,) and dry them well, firft o f themfelves, and then in an oven after the bread is
taken o u t: put it into a pot or pipkin, with fome flour, that they may be quite dried;
then cleanfe them from the flour, and their (talks, if they have any; cut both hulks
and feeds within them very fm all, and to every ounce o f them put a pound o f wheat-
flour ; m ake them up together into cakes or fmall loaves, with leaven proportioned
to the quantity you m ake ; bake thefe as you do bread o f the fmall fize, and, when
baked, cut it again into fm aller parts, and then bake it again, that it may be asdry
and hard as a bifeuit, which, beaten into fine powder, and fifted, may be kept for any
o f the ufes hereafter mentioned, or may ferve inftead o f ordinary pepper to feafon
meat or broth ; for fauce or any other purpofe the Eaft-Indian pepper doth ferve, for
it doth not only give good tafte or relifh to the meat or fauce, but is found to be very
good both to difeufs the wind and the cholic in the body: It is o f lingular lerviceto
be ufed with flatulent or windy diet, and fuch as breeds m oiftureand crudities ; one
fcruple o f the faid powder, taken in a little broth, o f veal or o f a chicken, gives great
relief and comfort to a cold ftom ach, caufing fiegm and fuch vifeous humours as lie
low in the bottom thereof to be voided ; it helpeth digeftion, for it occafioneth art
appetite to meat, provoketh urine, and, taken with faxifrage water, expelleth the (lone
in the kidneys and the flegm that breedeth th em ; and taketh away dimnefs or mitti-
nefs o f the fight, being ufed in m eats; taken with Pillulae Aleophanginae, it helpeth
th ed ro p fy; the powder, taken for three days together in the decodion of penny­
royal, expelleth the dead b irth ; but, if a piece o f the cod or husk, either green or dry,
be put into the wom b after deli very, it will make them barren for ever after; but the
powder, taken for four or five days fading, with a little fennel-feed, w ill eafe all pains
o f the mother. T h e fame alfo made up with a little powder o f gentian and oil o f
bays into a peflary, with fome cotton-wool, doth bring down the courles ; the fame,
m ixed with a lohoch or electuary for the cough, helpeth an old inveterate cough ;
being mixed with honey and applied to the throat, it helpeth the quinfey ;and made
u p with a little pitch or turpentine, and laid upon any hard knots or kernels in any
part o f the body, it w ill diflolve them, and not fuffer any more to grow there; and,
being mixed with nitre and applied, it takes away the morphew, and all freckles fpots,
m arks, and d ifco lo u rin g s,o fth esk in ; applied with hens-greafe, it dilTolveth all cold
impofthumes and carbuncles; and, mixed with (harp vinegar, itdiflolvcs the hardnefs

therewith, it will takeaw ay the fhaking-fits o f agu es; a plader made thereof, with
the leaves o f tobacco, w ill heal the (ting or biting o f any venomous beads.
T h e decodtionof the hufks themfelves, made with water, and the mouth gargled
therewith, helpeth the tooth-ach, and preferveth the teeth from rottennefs; the allies
o f them being rubbed on the teeth, will cleanfe them, and make them look white.
T h e decodtion o f them in wine helpeth the hernia ventofa, or watery rupture, if ap­
plied warm morning and evening : if put to deep for three days together in aqua-
vitae, it helpeth the palfy, the place affedted being bathed therewith ; and, deeped
for a day in wine and two fpoonfuls drunk thereof every day fading, it is o f Angular
fervice in rendering d in kin g breath fweet.

K inds and N ames. T H E R E are two forts o f p itch : the one m oift, called
liquid pitch, the other is hard and d ry : they do both run out o f the pine and pitch
tree, and out o f certain other trees, as the cedar, turpentine, and larch, trees, by
burning o f the wood and tim ber o f them. Pitch is called in Latin pixyin French poixt
in D utch peck. T he liquid pitch is called in L atin pix liquidity in Brabant tesr, and in
E n glifh tar. T h e dry pitch is called in Latin pix arida, and rnvdh 5 in E n g lilh
Ihip-pitch or ftone-pitch ; in Dutch fteen-peck.
G overnment and V irtu es. T h e pitch and tar are both folar, hot and dry in
the fecond degree, and o f lubtile parts, but the ftone-pitch is the drieft •, the liquid
pitch or tar is the hotcerand o f more fubtile parts. L iqu id pitch, taken with honey,
doth cleanfe the breaft, and is good to be licked in by thole that are troubled with
fhortnefs o f breath, whofe infide is clogged with corrupt mattter. It mollifieth and
bringeth co perfection all hard fwcliings, and is good to anoint the neck againft the
fquinancy or fw ellingof the throat: it is good to be put into m ollifying plafters, ano­
dynes to take away pains, and maturatives, or ripening m edicines: being applied
with barley-meal, it fofcneth the hardnefsof the matrix and fundament 5 liquid pitch
mingled with fulpbur vivum, or quick blimftone, reprelfeth fretting ulcers, foul fcabs
and feu rf; and, if fome fait be put thereto, it is good to be laid upon the wounds
occafioned by the bice or fting o f any ferpent or viper. It cureth the rifts and cloven
chaps that happen to the hands, feet, & c.
T . e ftone-pitch, being pounded very final], with the fine powder o f frankincenfe,
healeth hollow ulcers and fiftulas, filling them up with flefli; the ftone-pitch is not

K inds and N ames. T H E pomegranate-tree is diftinguiflied into three kin d s;
that is, the manured pomegranate bearing fruit, and the greater and letter wild kind :
that firft is called malmpunicum and malm granata, and the fruit malum punkum and
malum granaturn, becaufe it is fuppofed that they were brought over, from that part
o f A frica where old Carthage flood, into that part o f Spain which is now called
Granada, and from thence called Granatum . T h e flowers o f the manured kind (as
Diofcorides faith) are called citim-, but Pliny calleth the flowers o f the wild kind
c:t:mu9 and the flowers o f both kinds balaujlium ; but citinus is more properly the cup
wherein do fland the flowers o f both k in d s: balaujlium is with us generally taken for
the double flowers o f the w ild kind only.
D escription. T h e pomegranate-tree bearing fruit, malm punka fativa. T h is
tree groweth not great in the warm countries, and, where it is natural, not above
ieven or eight feet high, fpreading into many (lender branches, here and there fet
with thorns, and with m any very fair, green, fhining, leaves, like the leaves o f large
m yrtle, every one upon a fm a ll and reddifh foo tltalk. A m on g the leaves com e
forth, here and there, the flowers, which are like bell-flowers, broad at the brims,
and fmaller at the bottom , being one whole leaf divided at the top into five parts,
o f an orient crimfon colour naturally, but much paler w ith us, and many veins run­
ning through it, with divers threads in the m iddle, and (landing in a brownifk hollow
cup, or long hard h u sk : the fruit is great and round, w ith a hard, fmooch, brownifli-
red, rind *
, not very th ick, b u t yellowifh on the infide, and a crown at the top, ftored
plentifully with a fineclear liquor or ju ice, like wine, fu ll o f feeds inclofed in skins,
and the liquor am ong them . Sometimes this breaketh the rind as it groweth, which
w ill caufe it to rot very foon.
Place and T ime. T h e manured kinds grow in Spain, Italy, Portugal, and other
warm countries; but here in England they are preferved and houfed with great care,
(yet com e not to perfection,) and the wild kind w ith m uch m ore; theyfeidom
flower with us.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . T h e fun governs thefe plants and fruits. Pome­
granates are hot and m oift, but yet m oderate: all the forts breed good blood, yet
do they yield but (lender nourifhm ent; they are very helpful to the ftomach : thofe
that are fweet are moft pleafant, yet they fom ewhat heat, and breed wind and choler,
and
anil therefore they are forbidden in agues and thofe that are four are fit for a hot
fainting ftomach, ftay vom iting, and provoke urine, but are fomewhat olFenfive to
the teeth and gum s in the eating. T h e feed within the truit, and the rind
thereof, do bind very forceably, whether the powder or the decoction be taken, and
ftay catting, the bloody-flux, women’s courfes, the fpitting o f blood, and running
o f the reins, and is faid to be good for the dropfy : the flowers work the fame ef­

longings o f women with child ; the decofbion o f the rind or feeds o f the fruit, with
a little fy ru p p u tto it, is good againft the cankers in the m outh and ulcers in any
part o f the body, and againft ruptures j it alfo helpeth ulcers in the ears or nofc,
or rheums in the eyes, being dropped or injected ; it fafteneth ioofe teeth, de-
ftroyeth the flat worms in the body, and helpeth to take away wens. W ith the rinds

I H O L D it needlefs to trouble the reader with a ddcription o f thefe, fince both
♦
the garden rofes and the wild rofes o f the briers are well enough know n; take there*
fore the virtues o f them as f o llo w e d and firft I lhall begin with the garden kinds.
G o v e r n m e n t a n d V i r t u e s . Red rofes are under Jupiter, damafk under Venus,
and white under the M oon. T h e white and the red rofes are cooling and drying, and
yet the white is taken to exceed the red in both thofe properties, but is feldom ufed
inwardly in medicine. T h e bitternefs in the rofes when they are frefti, efpecially the
juice, purgeth choler and watery hum ours; but, being dried, and that heat which
caufed the bitternefs being confumed, they have then a binding quality $ thofe alfo
that are not full blown do both cool and bind more than thefe that are full blown,
and the white rofes more than the red. T h e decodtion o f red rofes, made with wine,
and ufed, is very good for the head-ach, and pains in the eyes, ears, throat, and gums,
as alfo for the fundament, the lower bowels, and the matrix. T h e fame decodtion,
with the rofes remaining in it, is profitably applied to the region o f the heart to eafe
the inflammation therein ; as alfo St. Anthony’s fire, and other difeafes o f the Jfto*
mach. Being dried and beaten to powder, and taken into fteeled wine or water,
it helpeth to ftay women’s courfes. T h e yellow threads in the middle o f the red rofes

preferving them from corruption, and fafteneth them if they be loofe, being wafhed
and gargled therewith, and fome vinegar o f fquills added thereto. T h e heads, with
the feed, being ufed in powder, or in a decoCtion, flay the lask and fpitting o f blood.
R ed rofes do ftrengthen the heart, ftomach, and liver, and the retentive fa c u lty th e y
^m itigate the pains that arife from heat, afluage inflammations, procure reft and deep*
ftay running o f the reins and fluxes o f the b e lly ; the juice o f them doth purge and
deanfe the body from choler and phlegm. T h e husks o f the rofes, with the beards
and nails, are binding and cooling, and the diftilled water o f either o f them is good
for heat and rednefs in the eyes, and to ftay and dry up the rheums and watering o f
them. O f the red rofes are ulually made many compofitions, all ferving to fundry
good ufes, viz. cleCtuary o f rofes j conferve, both m oift and dry, which is more
ufually called fugar o f rofes; fyrup o f dried rofes, and honey o f rofes; the cordial
powder called diarrbodon abbatis and aromaiica rofarum j the diftilled water o f
rofes, vinegar o f rofes, ointment and oil o f rofes, and the rofe-leaves dried, w hich,
although no com pofuion, is yet o f very great ufe and effect. T h e eleCtuary is p urg­
ing, whereof two or three drachms taken by itfelf in fome convenient liquor is a
purge fuflicient for a w eak confticution •, but may be encreafed to fix drachms, ac­
cording to the ftrength o f the patient. It purgeth choler without trouble, and is
good in hot fevers, and pains o f the head arifm g from hot choleric humours and heat
in the eyes, thejaundice alfo, and joint-achs proceeding o f hot humours. T h e m oift
conferve is o f m uch ufe, both binding and cordial; fo r, until it be about two years
old, it is more binding than cordial, and after that more cordial than binding: fome
o f the younger conferve, taken with mitbridatum, m ixed together, is good for thofe
that are troubled with diftillations o f rheum from the brain to the nofe, and deflux­
ions o f rheum into the eyes, as alfo for fluxes and lasks o f the b e lly; and, being
m ixed with the powder o f m aftic, is very good for the running o f the reins, and
for the loofenefs o f humours in the body. T h e old conferve, mixed with aromaticum
rofarum, is a very good cordial againft faintings, fwoonings, weaknefs, and trem ­
blings o f the heart, ftrengthening both it and a w eak ftom ach, helpeth digeftion,
ftayeth cafting, and is very good preiervative in the tim e o f infection. T h e dry con­
ferve, which is called fugar o f roles, is a very good cordial to ftrengthen the heart
and fpirits, as alfo to ftay defluxions; T h e fyrup o f dried red rofes ftrengtheneth a
ftomach given to cafting, cooleth an over-heated liver, comforteth the heart, refift-
eth putrefaction and infection, and helpeth to ftay lasks and fluxes. Honey o f
rofes is much ufed in gargles and lotions, to wafh fores, either in the mouth, throar,

them j it is alfo ufed in differs. T h e cordial powders, called diarrbodcn abbatis
and arcmaticus rofarum, do comfort and ftrengthen the heart and ftomach, procure
an appetite, help digeftion, (lop vom iting, and are very good for thofe that have (lip*
pery bowels, to ftrengthen them and to dry up their moifture. Red-rofe water is o f
well-known and familiar ufe in all occafions, (and better than dam afkrofe water,)
being cooling and cordial, quickening the weak and faint fpirits, ufed either in
meats or broths, to walh the temples, to fmell to at the nofe, or to fmell the fweet
vapours thereof out o f a perfuming por, or caft on a hot fire-fhovel *

and the temples o f the head alfo againft pain and ach, for which purpofe alfo vinegar
o f rofes is o f great fervice, and to procure reft and deep, if fome thereof and rofe wa­

more ufually to moiften a piece o f red-rofe cake cut fit for the purpofe, and heated
between a double-folded cloth, with a little beaten nutm eg, and poppy-feed ftrewed

to procure reft; it is alfo ufed for the heat o f the liver, o f the back and reins, and to
cool and heal puft.es, wheals, and other red pimples rifing in the face or other parts*
O il o f rofes is not only ufed by itfelf to cool any hot fwellings or inflammations, and
to bind and ftay fluxes o f humours unto fores, but is alfo put into ointments and
plafters that are cooling and binding, to reftrain the flux o f humours. T h e dried
leaves o f the red rofes are ufed both inwardly and outwardly, being cooling, binding,
and cordial; for with them are made both aromaticum rofarum,diarrbodonabbatis> and
faccbarum rofarum^ each o f whofe properties are before declared. Role-leaves and
mint, heated and applied outwardly to the ftomach, ftay callings, and very much
ftrengthen a weak ftom ach; and, applied as a fomentation to the region o f the liver
and heart, do much cool and temper them, and alfo ferve inftead o f a rofe-cake, to
quiet the over-hot fpirits and caufe reft and lleep. T h e fyrup o f damask-rofes is
both Ample and com pound, and made with agaric. T h e Ample folutive fyrup is a
familiar, fafe, gentle, and eafy, medicine, purging choler, taken from one ounce to
three or four i yet this is remarkable herein, that the diftilled water o f this fyrup
ihould notably bind the belly. T h e fyrup with agaric is more ftrong and efFedtiaJ,
for one ounce thereof by itfelf will open the body more than the other, and worketh
as much on phlegm as choler. T h e compound fyrup is more forcible in working on
melancholy
A N D C O M P L E T E H E R B A L .
melancholy humours, and againft the leprofy, itch, tetters, & c. and the French difeafe;
A lfo honey o f rofes folutive is made o f the fame infufions that the fyrup is made of,
and therefore worketh the fame effett botli opening and purging, but is ofcener given
to phlegmatic than choleric perfons, and is more ufed in clifters than in potions, as the
fyrup made with fugar is. T h e conferve and preferved leaves o f thefe roles are alfo
operative in gently opening the belly.
T h e fimple water o f the damask-rofes is chiefly ufed for fumes to fweeten things,
as the dried leaves thereof to m ake fweet powders and fill fweet bags. T h e wild
rofes are few or none o f them ufed in phyfic, but yet are generally held to come near
the nature o f the manured rofes. T h e fruit o f the w ild brier, which are called hops,
being thoroughly ripe, and made into a conferve with fugar, befides the pleafantnefs
o f the tafte, doth gently bind the belly, and flay defluxions from the head upon the
ftomach, drying up the m oifture thereof, and helpeth digeftion. T h e brier-ball is of-
teR ufed, being made into powder and drunk, to break the Hone, provoke urine when
it is Hopped, and to eafe and help the cholic. In the middle o f thefe balls are often
found certain white worm s, which, being dried, and made into powder, and fome o f

alfo to take a drop, two, or three, as the caufe requireth, for the inward griefs: yet
m uft it be done with difcretion, for it is very quick and piercing, and therefore bu|
a very little muft be taken at a time. There is alfo another oil made in this manner:
take what quantity you w ill o f the flowers, and put them into a ftrong glafs clofe
flopped, tie a fine linen cloth over the mouth, and turn the mouth down into another
ftrong glafs, which being fet in the fun, an oil will diftil down into the lower glafs,
to be preferved as precious for divers ufes, both inward and outward, as a fovereign
balm to heal the difeafes before-mentioned, to clear a dim fight, and to take away
fpots, m arks, and fears, in the (kin. T his herb is good for a dull and melancholy
man to make ufe of*, for, if they take the flowers, and make them into powder, and
bind them on the right arm in a linen cloth, this powder, by working on the veins,
w ill make a man more merry than ordinary.

by the gentle heat o f a fire, in regard the fun is not hot enough here to do it,) and
every piece kept from touching one another, will hold its colour almoft as well as

oftentimes ufed it.
Place. It groweth in gardens, and flowereth about the beginning or middle o f
June, and the feed is ripe in July.
T im e . T h e roots, that are to be dried and kept all the year following, are not to
be taken up before the fo lk and leaves be quite withered and gone, and that is not
until the middle or end o f O & o b er; and, if they be taken a little before the leaves

G o v e r n m e n t a n d V ir t u e s . M ars claims predominancy over all the wholefome
h erbs: a drachm o f the dried root o f monks rhubarb, with a fcruple o f ginger,
made into powder, and taken fatting in a draught or mefs o f warm broth, purgeth
choler and phlegm downwards, very gently and fafely,without danger: the feed there­
o f, contrarily, doth bind the belly, and hclpeth to flay any fort o f lask or bloody flu*.
T h e dittilled water thereof is very profitably ufed to heal fcabs, as alfofoul ulcerous
fores, and to allay the inflammation o f th em : T h e ju ice o f the leaves or roots, or the
decoction o f them in vinegar, is ufed as a mott effectual remedy to heal fcabs and
running fores.
T h e baftard-rhubarb hath all the properties o f the monks rhubarb, but is more
efte&ual for both inward and outward difeafes. T h e deco&ion thereof, with vine­
gar, dropped into the ears, taketh away the pains ; gargled in the mouth, taketh
away the tooth-ach; and, being drunk, healeth the jaundice. T h e feed thereof
eafeth the gnawing and griping pains o f thettom ach, and taketh away loathing.
T h e root thereof helpeth the ruggednefs o f the nails, and, being boiled in wine,
helpeth the fwelling o f the throat, commonly called the K ing's evil, as alfo the fwel-
lings o f the kernels o f the ears. It helpeth them that are troubled with the ftone,
provoketh urine, and helpeth thedim nefs o f the fight. T h e roots o f this baftard-
rhubarb are ufed in opening and purging diet-drinks with other things to open the
liver, and to cleanfe and cool the blood.
T h e properties o f that which is called the E nglifh rhubarb are the fame with the

barb, except the force in purging, wherein it is but o f half the ftrength thereof, and
therefore a double quantity mutt be u fed ; it likew ile hath not that bitternefs and
a ttr itio n ; in other things it worketh almoft in an equal quality, which are thefe :
it purgeth the body o f choler and phlegm , being either taken o f itfelf, made into pow­
der and drunk in a draught o f white wine, or fteeped therein all night, and taken
fatting, or put among other purges, as ihall be thought convenient, cleanfing the
ftomach, liver, and blood, opening obftruftions, and helping thofe griefs that com e
thereof *
, as the jaundice, dropfy, fwelling o f the fpleen, tertian and day agues, and
pricking pain in the Tides; and alfo it ftayeth fpitting o f blood. T h e powder, taken
with caflia difiolved, and a little Venice turpentine, cleanfeth the reins, andftrength-
eneth them, and is very effectual to ftay the running o f the reins. It is alfo given for
the pains and fweUings in the head, for thofe that are troubled with melancholy, and

Place. Itgroweth in many places in England, in the borders of moift meadows,
and by ditch tides;
T ime. It flowereth about July, or the beginning o f A uguft.
G overnment and V irtues. Diofcorides faith, thac this herb, bruifed and ap­
plied, perfectly healeth old fores : and the diftilled water o f the herb and Bowers doth
the like. It is ufed by fome, among other pot-herbs, toopen the body *
, but the roots
walhed clean, boiled in ale, and drunk, are more opening than the leaves. T h e root,
boiled in water, and the places o f the body moft troubled with vermin or lice walh­
ed therewith, while it is warm, deftroyeth them utterly. In Italy it is ufed againft
the plague, and in Saxony againft the jaundice.
* Pliny writeth, that there is fuch friendfhip between it and the fig-tree, tiiat it profpereth no where C o
well as under that tree, and delighteth togrow in funny places. It is an enemy to the toad, as being a great
enemy to poifon. The ancient aflrologers declare this herb hath a property of making a man chaflc; but a

G A R D E N R U E is fo well know n, both by this name and the name H erb of
Grace, that I fliall not write any defcription o f it, but fhall only fliew the virtues o f
it as follow eth:
G overnment and V irtues. It is an herb o f the Sun, and under Leo. It pro-
voketh urine, being taken either in meat or drink. T h e feed thereof, taken in wine,
is an antidote againft all dangerous medicines or deadly poifons. T h e leaves taken
either by themfclves, or with figs and walnuts, is called Mithridaees’s counter-poifon
againft the plague, and caufeth all venomous things to become harmlefs. Being o f­
ten taken in meat or drink, it abateth venery, and deftroyeth the ability to beget
children. A deco&ion made thereof, with fome dried dill leaves and flowers, eafeth
all pains, inwardly drunk, and outwardly applied warm to the place grieved. T h e
lame, beingdrunk, helpech the pains both o f the cheftand fldes, as alio coughs and
hardnefs o f breathing, the inflammations o f the lungs, and the tormenting pains o f
the fciatica and o f the joints, being anointed or laid to the places, as alfo the lhaking
fits o f agues by taking a draught before the fit. Being boiled or infufed in oil, it is
good to help the wind cholic •, it killeth and driveth forth the worms o f the belly, i f it
be drunk after it is boiled in wine to the h alf with a little honey. It helpeth the gout
or pains in the joints o f hands, feet, or knees, applied thereunto: and with figs it
helpeth thedropfy, being bathed therewith; being bruifed, and put into the nollrils,
it ftayeth the bleeding thereof. It taketh away wheals and pimples, if, being bruited
with a few myrtle leaves, it be made up with wax and applied. It cureth the mor-
phew, and taketh away all forts o f warts, if boiled in wine with fome pepper and ni­
tre, and the places rubbed therewith and, with allum and honey, helpeth the dry
fcab, or any tetter or ring-worm. T h e ju ice thereof, warmed inapom egranatelhell
or rind, and dropped into the ears, helpeth the pains o f them. T h e ju ice o f it and
fennel, with a little honey, and the gall o f a cock put thereto, helpeth the dimnefs o f
the eye-fight. A n ointment made o f the juice thereof, with oil o f rofes, cerufs, and
a little vinegar, cureth St. Anthony’s fire, and all foul running fores in the head ;
and the {linking ulcers o f other parts. T h e antidote ufed by Mithridates every
morning fafting tofecure him lelf from any poifonor infe&ion was th is: take twenty
Laves beaten together into a mafs with twenty juniper berries, which is the quantity
appointed lor every day. Another cleftuary is made th u s: take o f nitre, pepper,
and cummin feed, o f each equal parts; o f the leaves o f rue, clean picked, as much in
weight as all the other th ree; beat them well together, and put to it as much honey
as will make it up into an eleftu ary; (but you muft firft fteep your cummin-feed in
vinegar
vinegar twenty-four hours, and then dry it, or rather toaft it in a hot fire-fhovel, or
in an oven *,) and it is a remedy for the pains or griefs o f the cheft or ftomach, o f the
fpleen, belly, or Tides; o f the liver, by obftru<ftions ; o f the reins and bladder, by
the flopping o f urine.

G overnment and V irtues. T h is herb is under the dominion o f Saturn. R u p ­
ture-wort hath not its name in vain, for it is found by experience to cure the rup­
ture, not only in children, but alfo in grown perfons, if the difeafe be not too invete­
rate, by taking a drachm of the powder o f the dried herb every day in wine, or the
deco&ion made in wine and drunk, or the juice or diftilled water o f the green herb
taken in the fame m anner; and helpeth all other fluxes either in men or women;
vomitings alfo, and the gonorrhea, or running o f the reins, being taken any o f the
ways aforefaid. It doth alfo mofl afluredly help thofe that have the ftranguary, or
are troubled with the flone or gravel. T h e fame alfo much helpeth all Hitches in

G overnment and V irtues. R Y E is more digefting than wheat. T h e bread
and the leaven thereof ripeneth and breaketh impofthumes, biles, and other fw ellings:
the meal o f rye, put between a double cloth, moiftened with a little vinegar, and
heated in a pewter difli, and bound fail to the head while it is hot, doth much eaie

grounds, and is ripe about the middle o f autumn.
G overnment and V irtues. It is a folar grain. T h e phyfical ufe thereof is
chiefly to fo y the lasks and fluxes o f the ftomach and belly, efpecially if it be a little
parched before it be ufed, and fteel quenched in the m ilk wherein it is boiled, being

K inds and N ames. T H E R E is one fort called calamus aromaticus Mathioli,
M athiolus’s aromatical reed, a fecond called calamus aromaticus Syriacus vel Arabicus
fuppo/ttivusy the fuppofed Syrian or Arabian aromatical reed *
, and the third, the true
acorus o f Diofcorides, or fweet-fmelling reed, called in (hops calamus aromaticus, and
likewife acorusvents9Jive calamusofficinarum.
D escription, i . M athiolus’s aromatical reed. T h is groweth with an upright
tall d alk, fet full o f joints o f certain fpaces up to the top, (not hollow, but duffed
full o f a white, fpongeous, pith, o f a gum m y tafle, fomewhat bitter, and o f the big-
nefs o f a man’s finger,) and at every one o f them a long narrow leaf, o f a dark green
colour, fmelling very fweet, differing therein from all other kinds o f reeds ; on the
tops whereof groweth a bufhy or feather-like panicle, refembling thofe o f the com ­
mon reed. T h e root is knobby, with divers heads thereat, whereby itincreafeth and
fhooteth forth new heads o f leaves, fmelling alfo very fw eet, having a little binding
tafle, and (harp withal.
2. T h e fuppofed Syrian or Arabian aromatical reed, rifeth up from a thick root
three or four inches long, big at the head and fmall at the bottom, with one flalk,
fomecimes more, two cubits high, being Araight, round, fmooth, and eafy to
break into fplinters; full o f joints, and about a finger’s thicknefs, hollow and fpungy
within, o f a whitifh yellow colour ; the d alk is divided intoother branches, and they

der them likewife, very like unto the leaves o f lyfimachia, the willow-herb, or loofe-
Arife, butlefs, being an inch and an half lo n g; compaffing the flalk at the bottom,
with fundry veins running all the length o f them ; from the joints rile long (talks,
bearing fundry yellow fmall flowers, made o f leaves like alfo unto lyfimachia, with
a (mall pointel in the m iddle, after which follow fmall, blackilh, long heads or feed-
veflels, pointed at the end, and having in them fmall blacki(h feed: the flalk hath
little or no fcent,yet not unpleafant, as Alpinus faith, being bitter, with a little acri­
mony therein; but Bauhinus faith, it is o f an aromatical tafle, and very bitter.
3. T h e fweet-fmelling reed, or calamuscjficinarum,or acorusverus, hath many flags,
long and narrow frefli green leaves, two feet long, or m ere; yet oftentimes fome­

in the midft, and fome o f them as it were curled or plaited towards the ends or tops
o f them ; fm elling very fweet, as well when they are green and frefh as when they
are dried and kept a long time ; which do fo abide in a garden a long time, as
though it never did nor never would bear flower; the leaves every year drying down
to the ground, and fhooting out frefh every fp rin g; but, after three or four, years
abiding in a place, it fhooteth forth a narrow long leaf by itfelf, flat like unto the
other leaves, efpecially from the middle upw ards; but from the bottom to the middle
it is flat, at which place cometh forth one long round head, very feldom tw o ; in form
and bignefs like unto the catkin or aglet o f the hafel-nut tree, growing upright, and
o f the length and thicknefs o f one’s finger, or rather b ig g er; fet with fcveral fmall
lines or divifions, like unto a green pine-apple ; o f a purplifh green colour for the
moft p a rt; out o f which bunches fhoot forth fmall pale whitifh flowers, confifting o f
four fmall leaves apiece, without fo good a feent as the leaves, falling quickly away,
and not yielding any feed. T h e root is thick and long, lying under the furface o f
the ground, fhooting forward, and with fm all roots or fuckers, on all fides like unto
the garden valerian, whitifh on the outfide, or greenifh if it lie above the ground, and
more pale or whitifh on the inflde, with many joints thereabouts, and whereat it hath
or doth Ihoot forth long thick fibres underneath, whereby it taketh ftrong hold in
the ground.
P lace and T im e. T h e firft is faid by M athiolus, and others, to grow in India,
Syria, and Judaea; the dry ftalks o f the fecond are fatd to grow at the foot o f M ount
Libanus, in Syria, not fa r from T rip o li, in the wet grounds there; the third in fun-
dry moift places in E g yp t, and by the lake Gcnnefareth in Judaea, and in divers places

T h e other calamuso f the fhops, or true acorus> groweth in many places o f T u rk ey,
in m oift grounds, whence the largeft roots, the flrmeft, whiteft, and fweeteft, are
brought unto u s ; it grow eth alfo in Ruftia and thereabouts, in great plenty. It is
ibmetimes found in m oift grounds in Yorkfhire, and the northern parts o f England.
G o vern m en t and V ir tu es. T hefe reeds are under the dominion o f Venus, o f a
temperate quality. T h e calamus o f Diofcorides, he faith, hath thefe properties: it
provoketh urine, and, boiled with grafs-roots and fm allage, it helpeth thole that

baths tor women to fit in, alio in glitters to cafe pains.
It is ufed in m ollifying oils and philters, that ferve to ripen hard impofthumes, as
alio for the fweet fcent thereof. Galen faith, it being o f a temperature moderate, be­
tween heat and cold, and fomewhat aftringenc, and having a very little acrimony, it
is profitably ufed among other things that help the liver and ttomach, doth provoke
urine, is ufed with other things in fomentations for inflammations, and gem lyto
move checourfes. Diofcorides faith, that the fweet flag is good to provoke urine, if
the decoCtion thereof be drunk. It hel|>eth to eafe pains in the fides, liver, and
breatt, as alfo to ea(e the griping pains o f the cholic and cramp, and is good againtt
ruptures 5 it wattes the fpleen, helps the ftranguary, and bitings o f venomous crea­

There are many other forts o f fcabious, but thofe here defcribed are molt fam i­
liar with u s ; the virtues both o f thefe and the red being much alike, you will take
them as followeth.
G overnment and V irtues. M ercury owns the plant. Scabious is very effec­
tual for all forts o f coughs, fhortnefs, o f breath, and all other difeafes o f the breaft
and lungs, ripening and digefting cold phlegm and other tough humours, voiding
them by coughing and fpitting. It ripeneth alfo all forts o f inward ulcers and im-
pofthumes, the pleurify alfo, if the deco&ion o f the herb, dry or green, be made in
wine, and drunk for fome tim e together. Four ounces o f the clarified juice o f fca­
bious, taken in the m orning faffing, with a drachm o f M ithridate or Venice treacle,
freeth the heart from any infection o f peftilence, if after the taking o f it the party
perfpire two hours in bed. T h e green herb, bruifed, and applied to any carbuncle
or fore, is found, by certain experience, to diflolve or break it in three hours fpace.
T h e fame deco&ion alfo, drunk, helpeth pains and ditches in the fides. T h e decoc­
tion o f the roots, taken for forty days together, or a drachm o f the powder o f them
taken at a time in whey, doth (as M athiolus faith) wonderfully help thofe that are
troubled with running or fpreading fcabs, tetters, or ringworms, even though they
proceed o f the venereal difeafe. T h e ju ice, or decoftion, drunk, helpeth alfo fcabs
and breakings out o f itch and the like. T h e juice, made up into an ointment, is
effectual for the fame purpofe. T h e fame alfo helpeth all inward wounds, by the
drying, cleanfing; and healing, quality therein. A fyrup made o f the juice and fu-
gar is very effettual to all the purpofes aforefaid, and fo is the diftilled water o f the
herb and flowers made in due feafon *
, efpecially to be ufed when the green herb is
not in force to be taken. T h e decoction o f the herb and roots, outwardly applied,
doth wonderfully help all forts o f hard or cold fwellings in any part o f the body, and
is as effectual for any fhrunk finew orvein. T h e juice o f fcabious made up with the
powder o f borax and camphire, cleanfeth the skin o f the face or other parts o f the
body, not only from freckles and pimples, but alfo from morphew and leprofy. T h e
head being wafhed with the fame decoftion, it cleanfeth it from dandriff, feurf, fores,
itches, and the like, being ufed warm. Tents, dipped in the juice or water thereof,
not only heal green wounds, but old fores and ulcers alfo. T h e herb bruifed, and
applied, doth in fhort time loofen and draw forth any fplinter, broken bone, arrow­
head, or other thing, lying in the fleih.

G overnment and V irtues. Venus owns the herb. Strawberries, when, they
are green, are cold and d ry, but, when they are ripe, they are cold and moift.
T h e berries are excellent good to cool the liver, the blood, and the fpleen, or a
hoc
hot choleric ftomach > to refrcfh and comfort the fainting fpirits, and to quench
thirft. T hey are good alio for other inflammations, yet it is not amifs to refrain
from them in a fever, left by their putrifying in the ftomach they increafe the fits.
T h e leaves and roots boiled in wine or water, and drunk, do likewife cool the liver
and blood, and afliiageall inflammations in the reins and bladder, provoke urine, and
allay the heat and fharpnefs thereof: the fame alfo, being drunk, ftay the
bloody flux, and help the*fwellings o f the fpleen. T h e water o f the berries, care­
fully diftilled, is a fovereign remedy and cordial in the pacification o f the heart*, and
is good for the yellow jaundice. T h e juice, dropped into foul ulcers, or the decoc­
tion o f the herb and root, doth wonderfully cleanfe and help to cure them. Lotions
and gargles for fore mouths, or ulcers therein, or ellewhere, are made with the leaves
and roots, which arc alfo good to faften loofe teeth, and to heal fpungy foul gums.
It helpeth alfo to ftay catarrhs or defiuxions o f rheum into the mouth, throat, teeth,
or eyes. The juice, or water, is good for hot and red inflamed eyes 5 it is alfo o f ex­
cellent property for all pufhes, wheals, and other breakings forth o f hoc and (harp
humours, in the face and hands, or other parts o f the body, to bathe them therewith;
and to cake away any rednefs in the face, or fpots or other deformities in the fkin,
and to make it dear and fmooth. Some ufe this medicine: takefom any ftraw-
berries as you (hall think Acting, and put them into a diftillatory, or body o f glafs,
fit for them ; which being well clofedy fet it in a bed o f horfe-dung for twelve or
fourteen days, and afterwards diftil it carefully, and keep it for your ufe. It is an
excellent water for hot inflamed eyes, and to take away any film or Ikinthat begin-

long, in hard dry grounds not fprcading far, but in the loofer and moifler places
running down into the ground a pretty way, with divers knots and joints.

fix leaves like the other, o f an incarnate or blulh colour, with a round red umbone
in the middle o f every one, which is the beginning o f the berry, which when it is ripe
w ill be black, being more fappy or flefhy than the other, w ith Hones or kernels with­

from Am erica into Spain hath beenfeen frefli, even the whole plant, and hath been
verified in all things to referable the prickly bindweed, and in nothing different from
it. But certainly the plant o f farfaparilla that groweth in Peru and the W eft In­

from our briony: this doth wind itfelf about poles or any thing elfe it can lay hold

, the branches have crooked prickles growing on them as the fmilax
afpera hath, but fewer and not fo (harp; it hath very green leaves like thofe o f bind­
weed, but longer, and cornered like ivy-leaves, ending in a long point: the flowers
are faid to be very great and white, every one as big as a middle-fized difh, which,

P lace and T ime. T h e two firft grow in Italy, Spain, and other warm countries,
whether continent or ifles, throughout Europe and A fia. T he third is found only
in the W elt Indies j the beft is faid to come from the Honduras, others not fo good
from other places, as the fertility or barrennefs o f the ground, and the temperature
o f the climate, afford it-r and it hath ripe berries early in hot countries.
G overnment and V irtues. Thefe are all plants o f M a rs,o f an healingquali-

fore or after any deadly poifon is taken, are a remedy there-agaitift, ferving to expel
it. It is faid alio, that, if to a new-born child feme o f the juice o f the berries hereof
be given, it fhall not be hurt by poifon ever after ; it isgiven as an antidote againtl
all forts o f poifon and venomous thin gs: if twelve or fixtecn o f the berries, being
beaten to powder, be given in wine, it procureth urine, when it is flopped *
, the dif-
tilled water o f the flowers, being drunk, worketh the fame efteft, and cleanfeth the
reins, and afluageth inward inflammations. If thee>es be walked therewith, ittakech
away all heat and rednefs in them-, and, if the fores o f the legs be walked therewith,
it healeth them thoroughly. T h e true farfaparilla is held generally not to heat, but
rather to dry, the humours > yet‘it is eafily perceived, that it doth not only dry the
humours, but wafteth them away, by alecretand bidden property therein much
whereof is performed by fw eatirg, which it promoteth very efl*e<5lua!ly. It is much
ufed in man> kinds ofdifeafes; as, in all cold fluxes from the head and brain, rheums,
and catarrhs, as alio in all cold griefs o f the flomach, and expeJleth wind very power­
fu lly. It helpeth not only the French difcafe, but all manner o f achs in the fmews
or joints *
, all running fores in the legs, all phlegmatic fwcllings, tetters, or ringworms,
and all manner o f fpots, and foulncfs o f the Ik in : it is not proper to be given to thole
whofe livers are over hot, or to fuch as have agues. In former times, it was ufed
beaten to powder, and fo drunk ; others ufed to boil it until it became tender, which,
being beaten or broken, was afterwards flrained into the deco&ion, m aking a kind
o f thick drink like cream. Some others, and that m olt ufually, boiled it in water, to
the half, or the confumption o f the third part, as they would have it ftronger or weak­

o f faunders, whereof the white and yellow are fweet woods, but the yellow is the
fweeteft> the red hath no fcent. T h e faunders-tree groweth to be as big as a wal­
nut-tree, having fre(h green leaves like the maftic-tree, and darkifh blue flowers,
the fruit being like cherries for the flze, but without any tafle; black when they
arc ripe, and quickly falling away. T h e wood itfelf is without fcent, as it is faid,
while it is living and frclh, and l'melleth fweet only when it is dry. T h e white and
the yellow woods arc fo hard to be diftinguifhed before that time, that none but thofe
Indians that ufually fell thofe trees do know their difference before-hand •

are cooling and cordial, and ufed together in. fundry cordial m edicines; but the
white and the >ellow are the more cordial and comfortable, by reafon o f their fweet-
neis •
, and the red more cooling and binding; which quality neither o f the other are
without, though in a lefs proportion. T h e red is often uled to ftay thin rheum falling
from the head, and to cool hot inflammations, hot gouts, and in hot agues to cool and
temper the heat; but the white and yellow are both cordial and cephalic, applied
with rofe-water to the temples, procuringeafe in the head-ach, and are Angular good
for weak and fainting ftomachs through heat, and in the hot fits o f agues. T hey are
very profitably applied in fomentations for the ftomach, fpirits, and palpitations o f
the heart, which alfo do comfort and ftrengthen them, and temperate the melancholy
humour, and procure alacrity and mirth, which quality is attributed to the yellow*
more than the white.

G overnm ent and V irtues. This is a martial plant, and o f a churl ilh nature,
fo that there had need be great care taken in the choice thereof, that only that be
ufed in phyfic which is pure and without adulterationj which may be known if it
be not heavy, or clofe compact together, but that it be moderately light, with fome
fmall holes, or hollownefs, here and there, therein ; and that it be fmooth and plain
in the breaking, and not in grains or knots, or having fmall tticks or (tones in it;
fomewhat clear and blackifti, but not of a dcadifh dark or ill-favoured colour, and
that it may be made quickly into a very fine and white powder. It purgech both
phlegm, yellow choler, and watery humours, very ftrongly; but, if it be indifcreetly
given, it will not only trouble the Itomach more than any other medicine, but will
alfo fcour the guts, in working too powerfully, oftentimes unto blood, and often­
times unto faintings and fwoonings, and therefore is not fit to be given to any gen­
tle or tender body. Mefue declareth three feveral hurts or dangers that come to
the body thereby, and the remedies o f them \the firtt is, faith he, that it ingendereth

feed, or galanga, mixed with it, is the remedy hereof. T h e next is, that it inflameth
the fpirits, by the overmuch lharpnefs or fiercenefs therein ; whereby it readily in­
d u ced fevers, eipecially in thofe that are fubjett to obftrudtions, and replete with
putrid hum ours; which inconveniences are taken away by putting thofe things
into your decoftions that d o cool and quench the heat thereof; and fuch are the
mucilage o f the feeds o f pfyllium , or fleawort; prunes boiled, or rather the pulp o f
them, the juice,or thejulep, or the water, o f rofes or violets, or if before the boiling
thereof (that is the fcammony) you fteep it in the oil o f rofes, or violets, or in the
juice o f a quince, and mingle it with a little fhumac or fpodium. A third is, that,
having a ftrong opening and drawing faculty, it caufeth immoderate fluxes of the
belly, by opening the mouth o f the veins more than is f i t : this harm is alfo taken
away by mixing reftringent and retraining things with it, fuch as maftic, and ef- ■
pecially yellow, myrobolans, and quinces, or the juice o f them. A gain , it rafech
the intrails and guts, by reafonofthe fharp juice wherewith it abounds,and by which
it procureth pains therein; this danger is remedied if m oift, fat, and flippery, things
be ufed with it, as gum-tragacantb, bdellium, and oil o f almonds and rofes, as alfo the
pulp o f prunes made up with fugar, the mucilage o f fleawort feeds, maftic, and
quinces, taken afterwards, and warm water laft o f al l ; all which caule it to pafs the
quicker from the ftomach and bowels, and thereby prevents its doing harm. T his
fault is alfo helped if cold medicines as well as hot be m ixed together to be given,
thereby to yield help to the heart, liver, and ftomach. Diofcoridcs faith, if theju ice
be applied to the womb, it deftroyeth the birth, being m ixed with honey and ox­
gall ; and, rubbed on wheals, pimples, and pufhes, takes them all aw ay: and, boiled
in vinegar, and anointed, cakes away the leprofy, and outward marks in the (kin,
being difTolved in rofe-water and vinegar; and the head moiftened therewith eafeth
the continual pains thereof. A drachm or two o f the roots o f fcammony purge in
the fame manner as the ju ice doth, if fome o f the things that are appointed there­
with be given in it. T h e roots boiled in water, and made into a pou lcice, with bar­

black, and will abide frcfh long after it is felled.
2. T h e other fycamore is called fycomorus alttra, feu fiats Cypria^ thefycam ore o f
Cyprus. T h is groweth to be as big as a plum b-tree, or white poplar-tree, the arms
and branches bearing broad and fomewhat round leaves, like unto the elm, but very
like unto the former j this beareth fuch-like fruit as figs, but lmaller, which rife
both from the body and the greater arms, but not as the former > but on certain ftalks
in branches, which rife b y themfelves without any leaves with th em ; and are as
fweet as figs. T h ey bear four times every year, but not unlefs they be flit, that the

P lace and T ime. T h e firft grows chiefly in E g yp t, Syria, and A rabia, and
other places adjacent j the other in Cyprus, Caria, Rhodes, and the neighbouring
parts.
G overnment and V irtues. Thefe are under the particular influenceof Venus.
T h e fruit maketh the belly foluble, but by its overm uch moifture it troubles the
ftomach, and giveth but little nourifhment. T h e m ilk that is taken from the tree
by gently piercing the bark, and afterwards dried and made into troches, and kept
in an earthen pot, hath a property to foften tumours, and di/Tolve them •, and to fol­
der and clofe together the lips o f green wounds. T h e fruit itfelf, being applied as
a plafter, worketh the fame efFc£t.

K i n d s . T H E R E are accounted three forts o f the ftorax-tree, whole names
Ihall follow with their deferiptions.
D e s c r i p t i o n . T h e ufualftorax-tree is c a l l e d in LatinJlyrax arbor vulgaris. This
ftorax-tree groweth very like the qgince-tree, both for form and bignefs, the leaves
alfo are long and round, and fomewhat like, b u cfarlefs: whitilh underneath, and
ftiff, the flowers (land both at the joints with the leaves, and at the ends o f the bran­
ches, confiding o f five or fix largewhitifii leaves, like thofe o f the orange-tree, with
fome threads in the middle, after which come round berries, fet in the cups that the
flowers were in before, o f the bignefs o f hazel-nuts, pointed at the ends, and hoary
all over ; each (landing on a long footftalk, containing within them certain kernels
in fmall Ihells. T hisyieldeth a m od fragrant fweet gum , and clear, o f the colour o f
brown honey.
z. Storax with maple-leaves, jlyrax folio aceris. From a round root, covered with
acrefled or as it were a jointed bark, com eforth, o u to fk n o ts, three or five broad
leaves, like thofe o f the maple or plane-tree, (landing on fmall blackifii long (talks,
and are divided in three or five parts, full o f veins, dented about the edges, and
pointed at che ends.
3. Red ftorax, called in L atin jlyrax fubra. T h is hath formerly by (bme been
thought to be the bark o f fome kind o f tree that went under the name o f (torax.
But Serapio and Avicen, div ide ftorax into liquids andjicca: by liquids meaning the
pure gum flowing from che tree, and not that liquids which we now call by that
name *
, and by theJicca the faeces o f the exprefied oil from the fruit \ but calumita is
now taken o f fome to be red ftorax.
P lace an d T ime. T h e firft groweth in Provence o f France, in Italy, Candy,
Greece, and fome other parts o f Turkey, where it yieldeth no gum-, but in Syria,
Silicia, Pamphylia, Cyprus, a nd thofe hotter countries, it groweth much. It flower*
eth inthefpring, yielding fruit in September.

fecond degree, and dry in the firft; it heateth, m ollifieth, and digefteth; and is
good for coughs, catarrhs, diftillations o f rheums, and hoarfencls. Pills made with
it and a little turpentine, and taken, gently loofen the belly. It refificih cold pot­
ions; dropped into the ears, it helpeth the fmgings and noife in them ; applied to
the hips, joints, or (houldcrs, afilifled with cold achs, it refolveth and comforteth
m uch, and is good to be put into baths, for lamenefs o f the joints and wearinels by
travel. It is alfo good to be put with white rrankincenfe to perfume thole that have
catarrhs, rheums, and defluxions from the head to the note, eyes, or other parts, by
calling it on quick coals, and holding the head over the fmoak. It diffolveth hard
tumours in any part, and is good for the king’s-evil.

K inds. O F this there are three kinds. T h e ufual Latin name o f fwallow-wort
is afclepias or Venicemicum\ their diftinifc names follow m their deferiptions.
D escription, i. Swallow-wort with white flowers, afclepias flore albo. T h is
fwallow-wort rifeth up with divers flender weak (talks, to be two or three fleet long,,
not eafy to break, fcarce able to fl and upright, and therefore for the moft |>art leans
or lies upon the ground, if it find not any thing to futtainit;. whereon are fet tw o
leaves at the joints, being fomewhat broad and long-pointed at the en d ; o f a dark
green colour, and fmooth at the edges. A t the joints with the leaves, towards the
tops o f the (talks, and at the tops themfelves, come forth divers final! white flowers;
confiding o f five pointed leaves a-piece, o f a fw e e tfce n t; after which come fmall
long pods, thick above, in a great deal of white filken down, which when the pod is
ripe openeih o f itfelf, and (heddeth both feed and cotton upon the ground, if it be
not carefully gathered. T h e roots are a great bufh, o f many firings fattened toge­
ther at the head, duelling fomewhat ftrong while they are frefli and green, but more
pleafant when they are dried; both leaves and ftalks perilh every winter, andarifs
anew in the fpring o f the year, when the (talks, at their firft fpringing, are o fa black*
jfh brown.
2. Swallow-wort with black flowers, called in L atin afclepias flore mgro. T h is
groweeh in the fame manner that the former doth, having long flender rough bran*
ches, riling out to a greater height than the other, and twining about whatfoever
fiandeth next unto th em ; having fuch-like dark green leaves fet by couples, but
fomewhat fmaller, and o f a dark purplifli colour; after which come more plenti­
fully luch-like cods, with a white fiiver down and feeds in them as the former. T h e
roots
roots hereof are not fo bufhy as the other, neither fmell fo ftrong*, neither doth ft
give any milky but a watery juice when it is broken.
3. Swallow-wort o f Candy, afclepias Creiica. T his rifeth up in the fame fafhion that
the former do, with many (lender flexible green branches, with leaves fet at the joints
on either fide, as the white kind hath, and are very like them, but fomewhac o f a
paler white colour. T h e flowers (land in the fame manner, three or four together
upon a (talk, but are fomewhat o f a paler white colour*, to whom fucceed fometimes
but one pod, and fometimes two together, thicker and (horter than thofe o f the
white kind > ftraked all along and double-forked at the ends, wherein lie filk and
feeds as in the form er; the roots have not lb ftrong a fmell as the laft, and have, a*
well as the reft o f the plant, a feent like box-leaves.
Place and T ime. T h e two firft grow in rough and untilled ground, upon divers
mountains in France, about Narbonne, M aricilles, and Montpelier, and in Italy alfo ;
the !.ul in Candy. They (lower in the months o f June and July, and fometimes not
until A u g u ft; and their cods are ripe about a month after > die empty hulks abide on
the dry branches, when the feed and filk arc fallen out.
Government and V irtues. Thefe arc folar plants; the roots have a mod
fovereign faculty againft all poilons, particularly againft the apocynumy or dog's-
bane; and are effectually given to fuch as are bitten by any venomous beaft, of
llung by any ferpent or other creature; as alfo againft the biting o f a mad dog, a
drachm and an half thereof taken in carduus-water for many days together. It is
taken alfo, in wine, againft the plague and peftilence; a drachm taken in buglofs-
water is effectual againft all pafiions o f the heart; if the fame quantity o f citron-
feeds be taken therewith, it eafeth all the griping pains in the belly; the decoCtion
o f the roots made with white wine, taken for feveral days together, a good draught
at a time, and fweating thereupon, cureth the dropfy. T h e fame alfo cureth the
jaundice, provoketh urine, and eafeth the cough and all defeats o f the cheft and
lungs. T he powder o f the roots, taken with peony-feeds, is good againft the fal-
ling-ficknefs; or, with bafil-feed, or the rind o f pomecitron-feeds, is good againft
melancholy; and, taken with the roots o f diftamus albtts, or baftard dittany, will
kill and expel worms. T h e decoftion hereof, with comfrey-roots, made in wine, is
good for thofe that have a rupture, or are burften, or have received hurts by bruii'es.
T h e powder o f the roots or leaves is effectual tocleanfe all putrid, rotten, and filthy,
ulcers and fores, and may fafely be ufed in all falves, unguents, and lotions,, made
for fuch purpofes. T h e leaves and flowers boiled, and made into a poultice, and
applied to the hard tumours or fwellings o f women's breads, cure them fpeedily.

about two feet high, whereon grow thick fat green leaves, not fo large as the Indian,
round-pointed, and not dented about the ed ges; at the tops ftand divers flowers in
green hulks, fcarce above the brims o f the hufk, round-pointed alfo, and o f a green-
ifh yellow colour. Its feed is not very bright, but large, contained in great heads.
T h e roots perifli every winter, but rife generally o f its own Cowing.
N ames. It is called in Latin petum and nicotiam.
Place and T ime. E nglifh tobacco groweth much about W infcom b in Glou-
cefterfhire, as delighting in a fruitful foil *
, the other, which we fmoke, groweth beft
in Virginia, and is thence carried to fome parts o f Spain, and there made up and
then brought to us, and named Spanifh tobacco.
Government and V irtues. It is a martial plant. It is found by good experi­
ence to be available to cxpe&orate tough phlegm from the ftomach, cheft, and lu n gs;
the juice thereof being made into a lyrup, or the diftilled water o f the herb d ru n k;
or the fmoke taken by a pipe as is ufual, but fafting. T h e fame helpeth to expel
worms in the ftomach and belly, and to cafe the pains in the head, and the griping
pains in the bowels ■, it is profitable for thofe that are troubled with the ftone in the
kidneys, to eafe pains, and, by provoking urine, to expel gravel and the ftone; and
hath been found very effectual to expel wind. T h e feed hereof is very effectual to
help the rooth-ach, and the afhes o f the burnt herb to cleanfe the gum s and make
the teeth white. T h e herb bruifed, and applied to the place grieved with the king's
evil, helpeth it in nine o r ten days effe&ually. M onardus faith it is a counter poi-
fon for the biting o f any venomous creature^ the herb alfo being outwardly applied
to the hurt place. T h e diftilled water is often given with fome fugar before the fit
o f an ague to leflen it, and takes it away in three or four times ufing. I f the diftilled
feces o f the herb, having been bruifed before the dift illation, and not diftilled dry, be
fet in warm dung for fourteen days, and afterwards hung up in a bag in a wine-cel*
lar, the liquor that diftils therefrom is Angularly good for cramps, achs, the gout and
feiatica, and to heal itches, fcabs, and running ulcers. T h e ju ice is alfo good for all
the faid griefs, and likewife to k ill lice in ohildren’s heads. T h e green herb, bruifed
and applied, cureth any frefh wound or cut w hatfoever: and the juice, put into old
fores, both cleanfeth and healeth them. There is alfo made hereof a Angular good
falve to help impofthumes, hard tumours, and fwellings, by blows or falls.

G overnment and V irtues. It is under the dominion o f Saturn. Jf the root,
leaves, or young branches, be boiled in wine or vinegar, and drunk, and applied
outwardly, it is very powerful againft the hardnefs o f the fpleen. T h e leaves, boil,
ed in wine and drunk, are good to ftay the bleeding o f the hemorrhoidal veins, {pit­
ting o f blood, and helpeth the jaundice, the cholic, and the bitings o f all venomous
ferpents except the afp. T h e bark is as effectual, if not more, to all the purpofcs
aforefaid ; and both it and the leaves boiled in wine, and the mouth and the teeth
walked therewith, help the tooth-ach, the ear-ach, and the rcdnefs and watering o f
the eyes. T h e faid decoftion, with fome honey put thereto, is good to ftay gangrenes
and fretting ulcers, and to wafh thofe that are fubjett to nits and lice. T h e wood
is very effectual to confume the fpleen, and therefore to drink out o f cups and cans
made thereof is good for fplenetic perfons. T h e alhes o f the wood are ufed for all
the purpofes aforefaid j and, befides, do quickly help the blifters raifed by burnings
or fcaldings by fire or water. Alpinus and Veftingius affirm, that the Egyptians
do with as good fuccefs ufe the wood hereof to cure the French difeafeas others do
lignum vitas or guaiacum $ and give it alfo to fuch as are poftefled with the leproly,
fcabs, pulhes, ulcers, or the like and it is available alfo to help the dropfy arifing

applied to the navel, flays m ifcarriages; boiled in ordinary beer, and the deco&ion
drunk, it doth the like 5 alfo, it conforms thofe phlegm atic humours which the cold
and moifl: conflitution o f winter ufually infects the body with, and that was the
firft rcafon o f eating tanfey in the fpring. T h e deco&ion o f the common tanfey, or
the juice drunk in wine, is a Angular remedy for all the griefs that come by flopping
o f the urine, helpeth the ftranguary, and thofe that have weak reins and kidneys.
It is very profitable to diflolve and expel wind in the ftom ach, belly, or bowels. I f
it be bruifed, and often fm elled to, as alfo applied to the lower part o f the belly, it
is very profitable forfu ch women as are given to mifearry in child-bearing, to caufe
them to go out their full tim e ; it is ufed alfo again A the flone in the reins, efpecial-
ly to men. T h e herb fried with eggs, which is called a Eanfey, helpeth to digeft, and
carry downward, thofe bad humours that trouble the flom ach. T h e feed is very
profitably given to children for worms, and the juice in drink is as effectual. Being

o f the back, doth much help, not only this, but alfo thofe that cannot hold their
water, the powder being taken in the juice o f plantane; and it is alfo commended
againft the worms in children. It is very powerful in ruptures and burftings; as
alfo for bruifes and falls, to be ufed as well outwardly as inwardly. T h e root here­

afluageth pain, but ftayeth the flux o f humours which caufcd it. Torm entil is no lefs
effectual and powerful a remedy for outward wounds, fores, and hurts, than for in*

the corns o f green wheat is hurtful to the ftomach, and breedeth worms. Pliny faith,
that the corns o f wheat roafted upon an iron pan, and eaten, are a prefent remedy
for thofe that arc chilled with cold. T h e oil, prefled from wheat between two thick
plates o f iron or copper heated, healeth all tetters and ringworms, being uled warm,
and hereby Galen faith he hath known many to be cured. M athiolus commended)
the fame oil to be put into hollow ulcers to heal them up, and it is good for chops
in the hands or feet, and to make a rugged skin fmooth. T h e green corns o f wheat
being chewed, and applied to the place bitten by a mad dog, heal i t : flices o f wheat
bread foaked in red rofe-water, and applied to the eyes that are hot, red, inflamed,
or blood-fhotten, help them. H ot bread, applied for an hour at a time for three

boiled together, healeth all freckles, fpots, and pimples, on the face. W heat-flour
mixed with .the yolk o f an egg, honey, and turpentine, doth draw, cleanfe, and heal,
any bile, plague-fore, or foul ulcer. T he bran o f whear-meal deeped in /harp
vinegar, and then bound in a linen cloth, and rubbed on thofe places that have
the feurf, morphew, fcabs, or leprofy, will take them away, the body being lirfb well

exceedingly drying and binding. H owever, if any bees be difeafed thereby, the
cure is to let urine by them, but fet it in fuch a veflel that they cannot drown them-
felves, which may be remedied, if you put pieces o f cork in it. I told you the
herb is fodrying and binding, that it is not fit to be given inwardly. A n ointment

that grows in the (hadow is far better than that which grows in the fun, becaufe it de­

T H E flower, which is the beauty o f the plant, and o f none o f the leaft u(e in
phyfic, groweth yearly, and it is to be gathered when it is in its prime.
A s for the time o f gathering them, let the planetary hour, and the plant they com e
o f, be obferved, as above directed j as for the time o f day, let it be when the fun
ihines upon them, that they may be d ry ; for, if you gather either flowers or herbs
when they are wet or dew y, they will not keep. D ry them well in the fun, and keep
them in papers near the fire. So long as they retain their colour and fmell they are
good i either o f them being gone, fo is their virtue alfo.
O F S E E D S .
T H E feed is that part o f the plant which is endued with faculty to bring forth its
like, and it contains potentially the whole plant itfelf.
A s for place, let them be gathered from the places where they delight to grow.
L e t them be fully ripe when they are gathered, and forget not the celeftial harmony
before-mentioned, for I have found by experience that their virtues arc twice as great
at fuch times as others: there is an appointed time fo r every thing under the fun.
W hen you have gathered them, dry them a little in the fun before you lay them up.
Y o u need not he fo careful o f keeping them fo near the fire as the other before-men­
tioned, becaufe they are fuller o f fpirit, and therefore not fubjed to corrupt. A s
for the time o f their duration, it is palpable they will keep a great many years 5 yer,
they are beft the firft year, and this I m ake appear by a good argument, they will
grow fooneft the firft year they be fet, therefore then are they in their prime, and it
is an eafy matter to renew them yearly.
O F R O O T S .
O F roots, chufe fuch as are neither rotten nor worm-eaten, but proper in their
tafte, colour, and fm ell; fuch as exceed neither in foftnefs nor hardnefs.
G ive me leave here to deny the vulgar opinion, that the fap falls down into the
root in the autumn, and rifes again in the fpring, as men go to bed at night, and rife
again in the morning*, which idle tale o f untruth is fo grounded in the heads, not only
o f the vulgar, but alfo o f the learned, that men cannot drive it out by reafon: I f the
lap fall into the root in the fall o f the leaf, and lie there all the winter, then muft the
root
A N D C O M P L E T E H E R B A L . 393
root grow only in the winter, asexperience witnefleth : but the root grows not at all
in winter, as (he fame experience teachech, but only in the rummer* for exam ple: I f
you fet an apple-kernel in the fpring, it will grow to a pretty bignefs in that fummer,
and be no bigger next fpring: the truth is, when the Sun declines from the tropic o f
Cancer, the fap begins to congeal both in root and branch i when he toucheth the
tropic o f Capricorn, and afcends to us-ward, it begins to get thin again by degrees,
as it congealed.
T h e drier time you gather your roots in, the better they are: for they have the
lefs excrementitious moifture in them. Such roots as are foft fhould be dried in the
fun,or elfe hang them in the chimney corner upon a firing : as for fuch as are hard,
you may dry them any where. Such roots as are large w ill keep longer than fuch as
arefm all: yet moft o f them will keep a year. Such roots as are foft fhould be
always kept near the fire; and take this general rule for it, if in winter you find any
o f your roots, herbs, or flowers, begin to grow moift, as many times they w ill, (for
it is beft to look to them once a month,) dry them by a very gentle fire; or, if you
can with convenience keep them near the fire, you may fave this trouble.
O F B A R K S .
B A R K S whichphyficians ufein medicines are o f three forts: o f fruits, o f
roots, o f boughs.
T h e barks o f fruits are to be taken when the fruits are full ripe, as oranges, le­
mons, See. T h e barks o f trees are beftgachered in the fpring, if it be o f great trees,
as oaks, or the like *
, becaufe then they come eafieft off, and fo you may dry them if
you plcafe: but your beft way is to gather all barks only forprefent ufe.
A s for the bark o f roots, it is thus to be gotten: take the roots o f fuch herbs as
have pith in them, as parfley fennel, See. flit them in the m iddle, and when you have
taken out the pith (which you may eafily and quickly do) that which remains is cal*
led the bark, and is only to be ufed.
O F J U I C E S .
J U I C E S are to be prefled out o f herbs when they are young and tender, and
alfo o f fome (talks and tender tops o f herbs and plants, and a lfo o f fome flowers.
H aving gathered the herb you would prefervethe juice of, when it is very dry,
bruife it well in a (tone mortar with a wooden peftle *
, then, having put it into a
bag, prefs it hard in a prefc, then take the juice and clarify it.
W hefl
394
W hen you have clarified it,and it is cold, put it into a glafs, and put fo much oil
on it as w ill cover it the thickncfs o f tw o fingers; the o il w ill fwim at top, and fo
keep the air from com ing to putrify it; or, inftead o f o il, when you have clarified
theju ice as before, boil it over the fire till (when cold) ic be the thicknefs o f h o n ey:
then tie it down clofe, and keep it for ufe.
W hatever you gather o f plants, herbs, fruits, flowers, roots, barks, feeds, & c .
for medicinal purpofes, either for diftillation, fyrups, juleps, decoctions, oils,
electuaries, conferves, preferves, ointments, and the lik e, m uft be gathered when
they are in the greateft vigou r and fulleft perfection *
y fo r in that ftate only are they
fit to be applied for the reftoration and prefervation o f o u r health; and, when they
are applied, let it be done under the fympathetic influence o f planets participating
in the fame nature; the benefits o f which are fo amply demonftrated in m y D ifplay
o f the O ccu lt Sciences.
