Unconscious for 5 hours, in that time, I had ingested large amounts of blood and my lungs were failing. At some time, I later had a dream or experience that remains today, as clear as ever. I had other dreams over this period, but they have since diminished in detail. 

I was moving through a dark tunnel, toward a very bright light, the light did not cause any discomfort to my eyes, in any way. I felt drawn to this light and felt a strong tranquility and a feeling of a path to peace. To the left of this light appeared my son's face, no other part of his body, but it was as clear as anything was. He spoke the words, 'Don't do it Dad. Dad don't go', as clear as anything. The light began to dim and I felt myself recede from the tunnel. 

I found out later that when my son came home from the hospital, he would pray for me and write things down, wanting me to get better.
