She had accidently pushed my purse into a drain. I was leaning over to get it when suddenly everything went black. I thought at first that I was asleep. I wasn't aware that I was actually in the street in Glasgow. I felt like my body was missing and I was in a void space. The space seemed to have no limits and these were strange sounds like violins but more like voices. It was very loud. I felt very at ease, happy and not worried about how I was in this situation. I just felt like I was supposed to be here. Very quickly, I began to hear voices but I could actually hear them in my head but the sound was all around. I could also see what looked like an old woman wearing some sort of thick gloves, like rubber gloves. I thought she wanted to talk to me but she kept watching me. I recognized her but I don't know who she is at all. The musical sounds were coming from her and it was getting louder and louder. Suddenly I was seeing many strange crystal and glass objects. They had colors I'd never seen before. I suddenly heard a voice saying, 'Hello, hello.' Suddenly I was aware I was in Glasgow in the street. About seven minutes had passed. I felt it was years I had been in that state. Very strange.
