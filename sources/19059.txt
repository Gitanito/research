to these civilizations I think they&#39;ve
been less than pleased with so far the
response on balance that humans have had
towards them because it&#39;s either been
denial or fear or xenophobia or Frank
hostility I mean the Roswell event was
actually an electromagnetic system going
off that caused these two crafts it hit
each other and collide and crash was a
lot of people don&#39;t know that it was an
FBI document that pretty much states
that that it was a new radar dome well
the radar dome had a some sort of Tesla
coil type electromagnetic 1947 circa
1947 electromagnetic pulse and these two
crafts that we&#39;re seeing what we were
doing at the 509 wand&#39;rin which was the
only nuclear bomb squadron in the atomic
bomb squadron in the in the world at the
time at the time they weren&#39;t nuclear
bombs in their atomic you know
difference atomic nuclear atomic is
fission nuclear is fusion
anyway but it was an atomic bomb
squadron the only one and they turned
this thing on boom and these two crafts
that were going along one sort of
exploded right there northwest of
Roswell the other one descended and kind
of cracked in half or broke up near
Socorro and that&#39;s where they got the et
that was alive out of it what they
called the EB so there are two ships but
unfortunately that was a terrible event
it was a violent event so a lot of
people say well can&#39;t the ETS avoid that
if they have all these abilities I said
no not just because just because they
have advanced technologies does not make
them omniscient so here&#39;s another
mistake everyone makes they conflate
advanced civilization or more advanced
civilization with being godlike don&#39;t
make that mistake they&#39;re just people
like us but very very advanced now they
may have IQs of 450 so I&#39;m a by
comparison but
which I will admit I am a by
comparison with some of these
civilizations but or an imbecile a
primate but nevertheless it doesn&#39;t mean
that they become infallible you know I
think infallibility rests with divinity
and the unbounded being and that&#39;s it
anything this side of it is subject to
failure and error even the arching
Archangels so you just keep that in mind
as you as you look at this there&#39;s not
infallibility a sign just because it&#39;s
very very advanced it kind of reminds me
of the era everyone know what the cargo
cults were world war two great story
because this is a great example the
mistake humans make so in World War two
we were flying
you know these propeller planes and
landing them on islands in the Pacific
and we landed on some islands where
there were native peoples who had never
seen Western civilization or an airplane
and when we left and then came back we
came back we found that the native
peoples had made altars and made things
that look like a biplane with a
propeller and they were worshipping
because it was gods it had come from the
sky and it had become it&#39;s like the
movie the gods must be crazy you know
the guy throws a cook bottle out of the
window and people start fighting over
this so we we need to take a step back
and say okay these are a very advanced
civilization some of them maybe I think
are ten to the seventh years millions of
years more developed and we are and all
of them are thousands of years but many
of them are hundreds of thousands to
millions of years more developed
socially spiritually technologically
than Homo sapiens are but nevertheless
they&#39;re still people now there are
people that are very very advanced and
there are people some of them are so
advanced that they could be mistaken as
gods
and sort of ancient archaeology and the
ancient astronaut sort of concepts and
of course this makes no sense I mean if
you have something that appears like
that they can appear dematerialize Rema
Tyrael eyes go straight through objects
it would look like something
metaphysical and spiritual and so
they&#39;re very is the beginning of the
conflation of very advanced
civilizations and technologies with the
mythology that becomes sort of a
catechism and misunderstanding so we
need to be careful not to make that
mistake we need to say oh okay
childhoods end let&#39;s understand this and
approach these civilizations as really
advanced civilizations but because we
are conscious and began become in this
state of universal consciousness in that
sense equal totally 100% equal even
though we haven&#39;t developed all the fine
points of functioning yet I mean we&#39;re
more dysfunctional than functional I
think you all agree as a species but you
know we can have evolved to a higher
level of function through conscious
development evolution and these
civilizations understand that I think of
course the big concern of the last 75
years has been we you know we start
detonating nuclear bombs and hydrogen
bombs in the atmosphere and doing things
to destroy the biosphere in the oceans
you begin to see as one British
intelligence guy told me it&#39;s like we
kicked the hornet&#39;s nest because a red
flag went up over the planet after we
started detonating an atomic weapons
that wow these people who kind of gotten
off the reservation are an existential
threat to themselves and potentially
others so that&#39;s a perspective I want to
bring for just in anyway in the heart of
compassion of the Buddha as it were is
how my humans be viewed okay in the last
hundred years we&#39;ve killed around 200
million people in warfare and continue
to do so I live in the Middle East for
three years so plenty of stuff and
that doesn&#39;t count just murders for good
old-fashioned homicides I&#39;m an organized
murder which is warfare 200 million well
that&#39;s the population of many of these
planets though we just wiped out in a
couple generations through fighting over
what an economic system a religious
system of this system is esses so but
then you combine that so it&#39;s no longer
with swords and maces and even muskets
it&#39;s with thermonuclear weapons and in
covert programs these rather fearsome
scalar electromagnetic weapons based on
these very advanced transdimensional
Sciences so I think that the the
civilizations are correct have some deep
concern and I think they need also to
have people scattered around the world
everywhere who understand these issues
and we&#39;ll go out calmly but with a depth
of understanding and a depth of
experience and attempt to make contact
that&#39;s peaceful and mutually beneficial
which is the whole gist of the ce-5
initiative the Close Encounters of the
fifth kind initiative and a close
encounter a fifth kind is simply when
humans say I&#39;m gonna make contact as a
diplomat and initiate it and allow it to
continue however way it flows and it may
be in this dimension or it may be
transdimensional it may be in thought it
may be in part in this dimension and
part in another and sometimes it all
comes together in one night and all
those phenomena happen at once we&#39;ve
been out under the stars where we&#39;ve had
objects that have done electronics
people who&#39;ve had remote views in their
mind where they&#39;re ten five ten people
see or hear the same thing a craft that
appears that everyone sees etc and so on
and so forth now could the Holga mish of
sort of phenomenon and then there&#39;ll be
these beans that are moving around us
that aren&#39;t physical but that are
shimmering almost like a subtle hologram
moving around the desert or moving
around the on the beach or wherever we
are
really amazing stuff and what I what I
found is that people have expectations
that are based on let&#39;s go to Starbucks
and have you know across all and a latte
no no no there&#39;s other ways that they
they communicate and a lot of it is
cause that&#39;s edifying that&#39;s instructive
it opens up another dimension and aspect
and part of it is just practicality you
know if you&#39;re in an opera what&#39;s called
a hostile theater of operations using
military speak which would be called
earth that has space space weapons
systems that are all out there already
deployed since 1965 I know guys who
designed them that when these objects
fully materialized will target them with
an electromagnetic scalar weapon that
goes faster than the speed of light
believe me they&#39;re not gonna it&#39;s not
the 50s and 60s anymore where they just
would materialize and land everywhere
now they do sometimes but it&#39;s risky so
we have to operate with that
understanding also
so there&#39;s another understanding I want
to bring to this that people do not like
hearing but you know I&#39;m an emergency
doctor you come into my er with a
headache and I find a brain tumor I&#39;m
not going to tell you got a migraine and
I say you got a brain tumor so here&#39;s
the deal we&#39;ve developed systems that
unfortunately are approaching parody
transdimensional II with what some of
these civilizations have in terms of
technology which means that we are a
threat and also means that now not that
they&#39;re that the intelligence community
can&#39;t be everywhere at all places at all
times believe me
unfortunately when I&#39;m around doing
something like this and in all
likelihood it is monitored but you guys
this is why my whole whole idea is to
squeeze the tube of toothpaste so and
get it out and then I become redundant
unnecessary if I drop dead doesn&#39;t
matter because you guys can do it and
they cannot keep track of thousands with
tens of thousands of people now who
under
danara are attempting to do this so I
think that&#39;s the power of the people
coming together and decentralizing this
operation and by desensitizing it&#39;s a
decentralized in it away from from me
and my mice the center of my operation
because they cannot keep track of all
that so don&#39;t don&#39;t make the boogey man
in the intelligence community more
powerful than they are it&#39;s a little bit
like the Wizard of Oz you know the man
behind
who&#39;s the man behind the curtain you&#39;re
pulling all the levers Carolyn the
bejeebies out of everyone now I&#39;m not
saying they&#39;re a total paper tiger but
at the same time they&#39;re not omniscient
or omnipresent which means that you guys
can do this and have some amazing
success with contact separate from me
being around now my purpose is just to
teach and to let people understand how
this happens and then go do it yourself
the medical model is see one do one
teach one you see it done once if you&#39;re
in med school you see it done once and
then you do it in the next time you&#39;re
teaching someone to do it
so that&#39;s the model and it works because
that&#39;s how it propagates knowledge
propagates very quickly that way and if
you take that to heart
you&#39;ll find that you begin to learn
these abilities in meditation and this
the techniques of the ce-5 protocols go
out and do some experiences and then you
have some learning curve and you begin
to share with other people man it just
takes off and we have some great people
around we&#39;re all over the world doing
this like I said every continent so
that&#39;s that&#39;s what I want to encourage
people to do and empower you to do it
you
you
