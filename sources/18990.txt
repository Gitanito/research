hello everyone I&#39;m back I&#39;m dr. Steven
Greer and I&#39;m here with dr. Russell Targ
very honored to have dr. tart with us
today he&#39;s coming from California on
this youtube live special event for the
premiere of Close Encounters of the
fifth kind contact has begun and again
I&#39;d like to give the great news that
this documentary is now number one
worldwide on iTunes and that&#39;s just in a
few hours we&#39;ve raised strike to number
one and I&#39;d like to thank everyone for
making that possible
everyone who crowd funded this were
right at eight hundred thousand dollars
on the crowdfunding and that we&#39;ve done
a you&#39;ve all done a great job in making
this happen for everyone who wants to
learn about this and I&#39;d like to thank
dr. Tariq as he appeared in this film
those have you&#39;ve seen it already some
of you have it&#39;s just released today and
he provides some really beautiful
insights into consciousness the science
of consciousness and the fact that this
has been known for millennia in various
cultures so dr. Targa&#39;s a physicist I
believe you were a laser physicist with
Lockheed for some time and then worked
for the remote viewing projects with the
CIA and have some amazing experiments
that you&#39;ve been witness to and I just
like to for you to to go forward when
you share with the public your
experience in your journey and what you
discovered as a scientist about the
nature of consciousness and thought well
I&#39;m very happy to be here to celebrate
the release of your wonderful new film
I enjoyed that thoroughly and was happy
to see people transcending space and
time as you sat there with your laser
pointer telling them where to look
beautiful thing the thing that I can
tell you about is that I have now 40
years of experience sitting in a room
with people and saying somebody is
hiding somewhere
the world I&#39;d like you to quiet your
mind and tell me what it looks like
where they&#39;re hiding
Nazi instruction there&#39;s no no magic
mumbo jumbo just quiet your mind and
tell me the surprising images that will
show up and people can do that
describing what&#39;s across the street in
Palo Alto or what&#39;s going on in Soviet
Russia or in China and the most
important thing that I can tell you as a
physicist what we discovered is there
it&#39;s no harder to describe something
thousands of miles away than it is to
describe something across the street
what a modern modern physics call that
non-local non-local perception but the
most interesting thing that we
discovered and been replicated in many
laboratories is also no harder to
describe something that&#39;s going to occur
days or weeks in the future than it is
contemporaneous and many labs have shown
that now including professor John at
Princeton and the best evidence we have
that you can look into the future is
that after I left SR I I did a little
experiment where we were forecasting
changes in the silver commodity market
so each day on Monday I would sit with a
sidekick in my kitchen and say can you
tell me please what I&#39;m gonna put in
your hand next Friday five days later
and that object would be determined by
whether the silver market goes up a
little up a lot down a little or down a
lot and we did that correctly nine weeks
in a row Wow
so this was not in the nature magazine
this was on the front page of The Wall
Street Journal California firm has
cornered the silver market because
without error we made a hundred and
twenty thousand dollars that was in the
1980s when 120 thousand was a lot of
money but doing anything a prime and
doing anything nine times in a row is
quite remarkable right it&#39;s amazing yeah
that just shows that what&#39;s interesting
is that while there are renowned people
doing remote viewing such as Ingo Swann
who is a friend of mine prior to his
passing and others that in reality every
human being who is conscious and and is
willing to give some time to the
practice of it in the study of it can&#39;t
can&#39;t accomplish these things that&#39;s a
very important idea that this is not
unique to a few people right in fact
after leaving SR I in the 1980s I was
teaching remote viewing all over the
world and many producers set out set me
up in Japan or in Italy and Stockholm
and the first thing I would say from the
stage to the audience is that I expect
everybody here will either do something
psychic or see something psychic if that
doesn&#39;t happen we&#39;ll give you your money
back and producers are often very
shocked because they didn&#39;t expect that
to happen but in fact as I would stand
on the stage and lead people through a
exercise everyone would either have a
psychic experience or observed that
their nature had drawn or described
something perfectly and that&#39;s really an
important idea that this is a widespread
ability and as you said this is not new
age this was heart and soul of Buddhist
teachings back before the time of Christ
the earliest Buddhist writings by
publisher Baba and other Buddhist
teachers they expected you to be able to
quiet your mind see into the distance
see into the future diagnose illnesses
and heal the sick and that was not for
special people that&#39;s for anybody who
learned to quiet their mind locate the
off switch and discover that your nature
is timeless awareness the powerful
teaching of Buddhism is not in a Dogma
any belief system any stuff to do
Buddhism gives you
control of your mind give to show you
how to find the off switch quiet your
mind and what you discover is that you
are not actually made of meat and
potatoes but your nature is timeless
awareness which is to say your nature
when you quiet your mind you discover
that you can move your center of focus
out into the universe or into the future
and you discover those who you really
are exactly and that&#39;s what what I&#39;ve
experienced in training people all over
the world to do cg5 is that a lot of
people have this idea because they&#39;ve
learned it from our society and our
religious institutions and teachers that
you can&#39;t do this and the first thing
that people have to get over is this
gremlin on their shoulder saying I can&#39;t
I can&#39;t I can&#39;t
I&#39;m a dumb clump of clay and so every
you kind of have to turn off that
negative noise and voice that says you
cannot do it study and understand the
nature of consciousness which is why we
included the science of consciousness
experiments in this movie so people see
that there is objective data that shows
that in fact as you mentioned earlier
before we went live that urban
Schroedinger said you know the total
number of minds in the universe is one
it&#39;s a singularity and that singularity
is the true nature of every mind and the
conscious mind that is within each being
even though we may identify it with our
ego and self and it&#39;s deep and quiet
nature is this field of awareness that
isn&#39;t limited by space or time yeah I
completely agree with that Schrodinger
had a nice way of putting that he said
that consciousness is a singular of
which there is no plural what we&#39;re all
connected together now my interest as a
scientist is in what we&#39;ve been
discussing but we actually did this work
for the CIA for two decades and the CIA
is not noticed for their metaphysic not
noted for their metaphysical Indra
but each day or each week we would have
to do some operational thing to pay the
rent so we did stuff like whoa the film
I made a film recently called Third Eye
Spy that opens with Jimmy Carter
thanking us for finding a downed Russian
bomber in Africa the Russian bomber went
down under the canopy of forests to
northern Africa and we couldn&#39;t find it
with our satellites because it was under
the trees but a remote viewer in
California was able to quiet her mind
mark a map and say if you go there
you&#39;ll find the mountains are on the
right and before the mountains of the
river and then there&#39;s a village between
the mountain and the river you&#39;ll find
the down bomber and we the CIA then
launched a helicopter with nobody&#39;s
permission right into a clearing in the
jungle in time to see villagers pulling
wreckage out of the out of the river so
we found something that no one else
could find well we did that for 20 years
for the CIA yeah it&#39;s a fascinating
movie that you did Russ were the third
eye spies I think it&#39;s up on Amazon
Prime and other sites and people should
take a look at that because it&#39;s a
really good review of knowing the
history of this but the capabilities
that people have and I think it&#39;s really
important that we begin to normalize
this concept of what the nature of the
conscious mind is and not you know take
it out of the mystification and the sort
of unattainable &#39;ti that you have to be
you know a Swami on a bed of nails for
40 years or something I think we need to
hate to say it that way but I think we
need to make it approachable in real for
people and I remember meeting with the
State Department officials some years
ago who was asked to go to Australia and
Isis would maybe in the 70s and do a
track with the aboriginals who had
something called dream time with its
when the enduring the dream lucid dream
state they would see
what would happen the next day or next
week and they would actually act on it
it was as part of their culture and he
was sort of went over there to do a
study in an ethnography and to look into
really how their culture considered this
to be completely normal and it was
fascinating
because I think I mentioned to you and
we were talking on the phone not long
ago that I met my wife in a lucid
precognitive dream that happened five
nights in a row and I was only 22 and I
was no more interested in being married
than the man in the moon at that age but
I said well this is apparently and then
a few weeks later I was in Israel in the
Middle East and she came as a Peace
Corps worker to a convention there and I
met her I said that&#39;s her poor said and
go up to a complete stranger and say hey
I had a dream with you were supposed to
be married but that was you know 42
years ago married right back on the
caboose we say Mazel Tov no thank you
yeah well I see on my screen be right
over my shoulder is a picture of a bunch
of windmills and right under that is a
wonderful drawing of a bunch of
windmills and that was Joe mcmoneagle
right with one of a group of army
officers that we trained to do remote
viewing and part of the idea that remote
viewing is not a special ability that
only a bunch of weirdos have I had six
army officers in their leather jackets
and boots come marching in my office for
six weeks and my job was to show each of
them how to do remote viewing and they
were the key guys setting up a remote
viewing program at Fort Meade and in the
picture over my shoulder of the blue sky
and then below that we had a CIA office
CIA agent said well I want to see this
happen so he said I&#39;m gonna go hide
somewhere and at noon Joe should
describe where I am and Joe made this
super accurate description of a windmill
farm which is a hundred miles east
SSRI and he did that for a decade
there was no decay no fall-off in his
ability in things like hard guessing
which is a very boring psychic ability
that was done for a decade before we did
remote viewing you often had a fall-off
in ability because people get bored into
a decline raise absolutely no decline in
remote viewing people improve like
learning the piano you don&#39;t get worse
with practice you get better with
practice
right and we found is that many of the
people we worked with for a decade or
more improve their ability as they
learned through the intellectual
capability to separate the psychic
signal from the mental noise you have
we&#39;re going to get rid of guessing and
imagination and memory which is a source
of noise and look for the psychic signal
which appears in your awareness and
that&#39;s a intellectual dessert
which people can become more acute and
more skillful so the fact that I can
take a bunch of people who are
interested and show them the steps and
at the end of a weekend they&#39;ll all be
saying I didn&#39;t know I could do that so
I&#39;m not so my feeling people often
wonder can I teach you how can you teach
me how to do remote viewing the answer
is you already have the ability to do
remote viewing my job is to give you
permission to make use of an ability you
already have exactly and then it&#39;s such
a great perspective because that&#39;s what
I have always I&#39;ve been a meditation
teacher since 1974 and what I found is
that people have to have an affirmation
and maybe sometimes they need someone to
sit with them and just tell them and and
share this is that this is the nature of
the consciousness you already have
you&#39;re not people say where do I have to
go you don&#39;t have to go anywhere yeah I
said I said and sometimes in an audience
with a large audience I&#39;ll say look
let&#39;s look to the person right beside
you that person is awake you&#39;re you&#39;re
awake and you eat your
conscious even though you&#39;re unique
people like you no two snowflakes no two
or quietly identical however the light
of consciousness is conscious field is a
singularity and so the light of
awareness that you&#39;re sensing from your
the person next to you in the light of
awareness within yourself is one now
expand that to the whole audience and
then to the whole city or out too and
there in dromeda galaxy two and a half
million light-years away since there&#39;s
no limit and space for time of by the
nature of consciousness which has been
proven in scientific experiments that
that you refer to and that we refer to
in this movie what happens is that when
people begin to experience in a small
way a baby step then they begin to learn
that they can sit with others go into
meditation and see what&#39;s going on out
by the Saturn or Jupiter by the way I&#39;m
sure with folks this cool story about
Ingo Swann because he was such a great
guy loved being with them with the
experiment he did with Jupiter Oh early
on one of our in the beginning I was at
a conference on speculative technology
and Wernher von Braun was there and I
had my ESP teaching machine which is a
fortress gadget that helps you develop
your psychic ability and that&#39;s
available free from the Apple iTunes
Store the Apple ID store it&#39;s called ESP
Traynor and it offers feedback and
reinforcement so way back in 1972 I
already had this gadget that I built and
a cot at this conference and von Braun
did very very well with that he the
famous rocket designer ran the American
rocket program after he ran the German
rocket program but he did super well
with my ESP game and he took me in my
game to the director of NASA the Jim
Fletcher and so these guys just want
$80,000 to start a program I think we
ought to get them started so it was the
fact
that I coincidentally showed up at this
NASA conference at st. Simon Island
von Braun did super well with my game
that we were invited to start a program
in math Edgar Mitchell came to our
conference Charlie Anderson and we
started a program so early in our
activities we had a NASA contract and
George pesters who was head of new
products new projects at NASA was
sitting with Ingo Swann and me in my
office
he&#39;s an Ingo I&#39;ve seen a lot of remote
viewing that you&#39;ve done we&#39;re gonna
send a spy near spacecraft to Jupiter
could you tell us if we&#39;re gonna find
anything interesting there that we
haven&#39;t seen before and Ingo took a big
puff on his cigar and asked me for a pad
to write on and he started drawing a
sarang Jupiter and drew a big circle
around it he said well when you get
there you&#39;re gonna find a circle of AI
Chris ice crystals around Jupiter and
George said well you&#39;re thinking of
Saturn aren&#39;t you Saturn&#39;s the one with
rings Jupiter said I&#39;ve been looking at
the solar system my entire life just
believe me I know the difference between
Saturn and Jupiter eight months later we
got a photograph from NASA that
remarkably resembles what Ingo had drawn
showing a single ice crystal circle
around Jupiter that no one had ever seen
before is to faint to be seen in the
telescope but it shows clearly in NASA&#39;s
photographs and the photograph greatly
resemble would Ingo Drew and the point
of this is that it took no time at all
for Ingo to suddenly focus his attention
five hundred million miles away and
describe what we&#39;re gonna see on Jupiter
example didn&#39;t after meditate didn&#39;t
have to chant any mantras well look at
Jupiter I can do that give me a piece of
paper and I&#39;ll draw you a picture well
this way when I was talking to Michael
Missoula in the previous segment
I was mentioned to him that the process
we&#39;re doing with close encounters of the
fifth coming when you first come across
it you kind of have to learn but you can
go from doing the quieting the mind
remote-viewing and then we turn it
expand it to a vectoring connection to
these civilizations where we zoom in and
show them where we&#39;re located it&#39;s sort
of the reverse of scene out we guide
them in and that process which some
people find laborious when they first
started can happen in two three four
seconds so often when I go out I just
connect to that aspect of consciousness
intend to see and connect and invent and
then show and it&#39;s a very quick but to
get to where that is you kind of need to
practice like you said a people if
you&#39;re learning the piano or I&#39;m not
very good with musical instruments at
all in fact I&#39;m a klutz but my analogy
is that it&#39;s a medical student learning
to do a cut-down on the throat or a
chest tube or those kind of things when
you first do it it&#39;s like oh my god but
then after you&#39;ve done it lots of times
or run a code blue and resuscitated
someone and done all this stuff there&#39;s
a there&#39;s a alacrity and an automaticity
that it just becomes very quickly word
even though it sounds horrific to a
layperson so I tell people as you
practice the conscious meditation
mindfulness and do this it becomes more
and more natural and when I remember
talking with Ingo about this and he
wrote me a beautiful letter where he
loved what we were doing with groups of
people connecting to this aspect of
consciousness within a sort of a
construct of contact and universal peace
and some purpose he said he really
thought what we were doing was a
wonderful application of what they had
studied at ESRI by the way s RI just to
define I know you didn&#39;t it says
Stanford Research International that you
had been with and that it was sort of an
application of that but it within a
construct of the purpose of reaching out
to these other civilizations
within the framework of what I call
universal consciousness but also
Universal peace that there those grow
from each other I agree with that and we
all have this ability you don&#39;t have to
be a Buddhist you don&#39;t have to believe
anything at all right you have to learn
to quiet your mind with the teacher the
teacher basically shows you the moves
it&#39;s like if you use some if you see
somebody riding a unicycle that looks
clearly impossible how can possibly be
able to ride the thing with no
handlebars and one wheel and if a
teacher will simply stand you up tell
you what you&#39;re supposed to do and give
you a little push you can ride away and
you go from being impossible to doing it
and the reviewing is very much like that
exactly it&#39;s beautiful you know I
enjoyed watching your film where you&#39;re
pointing out with your green laser
pointer into the sky calling in a group
of UFOs which are tripartite to begin
with and the three of them merge
together into and the two merge together
in one showing that they&#39;re obviously
outside of time and outside time and
space this is obviously a
multi-dimensional project they can
certainly interfere with radar you can
see them on radar but they also see
something making use of either another
dimension or a complex space-time when
it goes into the other dimension it
doesn&#39;t drift off the screen it just
gets smaller and smaller and disappears
and we think that&#39;s like a functioning
makes use of a complex space-time
because in a complex space-time there
will always be a path through that
space-time where there is no distance
between you and the distant place you&#39;re
looking at there&#39;s not no distance in
time so if you want to see something a
thousand miles away three days in the
future just give me the instruction and
Ingo can tell you what
happening basically that happened one
day the CIA came in and today today we
need to know what&#39;s going on at these
coordinates Ingo and today is Wednesday
we want to know what&#39;s going to be
happening there Friday he said without a
moment&#39;s pause he said well I see the
beautiful pyrotechnic display looked
like fireworks in the sky and the row of
trucks in the distance and I got him
some colored pencils and he drew this
bunch of circular arcs in the sky three
days later we learned that there was a
Chinese atomic bomb test at that
location and it did not go off with a
failed atomic bomb test which is to say
when you burn uranium in the air it
makes a pyrotechnic display does not
make much room cloud so Ingo was able to
tell three days in advance that at this
distant location there was going to be
an atomic bomb test which we of course
did not know and he was able to provide
enough detailed information about this
future event so the CIA agents who are
in the know because they aha it is going
to be an atomic bomb test and it will
fail so Ingo was able look ten thousand
miles to the west three days into the
future and make an accurate dart drawing
of what was eventually seen yes right
exactly so now I&#39;m answering that
capability being used with these
interstellar civilization Evie is
transdimensional interstellar because if
civilizations that are a few hundred
thousand to a few million years beyond
where we are and after all the universes
if you believe astrophysicists estimates
thirteen to fifteen billion years old
that&#39;s not much time so civilizations
that are thousands of years of beyond us
their technologies are all by nature
transdimensional and their communication
technologies are sort of a
very far advanced version of what Elon
Musk is wanting to do with his
neuro-link company where he&#39;s studying
how to create a technology that picks up
on directed thought and causes it to
turn a computer on or do functions just
to thought not through wires and so
neural link is studying that they hope
by 2025 they&#39;ll have a the first
operational model and so we&#39;re also we
tend to be very narcissistic and myopic
we have to think about what are the
technologies that are extant by sin in
civilizations that are thousands of
years beyond where we are and where they
have studied and perfected technological
interfaces with other aspects of
dimensions space time subtle
electromagnetic fields and etc and so on
and what we discovered is that these
civilizations have technologies that
pick up coherent direct thought not only
innately telepathically
but technologically as easily as you and
I or using a computer or a cell phone to
communicate which of course to everyone
listening is that the speed of light
but the speed of light is too damn slow
I know when i briefed the CIA director
and his wife his wife was the chief
operating officer of the national
academy of sciences and she was
intelligent enough to ask this question
she says well how would they be
communicating across those vast
distances and I started talking about
the science of consciousness nonlocality
that they have systems that interface
with these other dimensions and thought
as easily and precisely as we were using
cell phones and television and radar and
what-have-you radio frequencies and she
looked at me I thought she would be
laughing me right out of the place and
she said I thought it had to be
something like that but now the director
of the CIA was more of a an attorney and
a apparatchik he it sort of looked over
past him but hurt his wife who was a
science has really understood this you
should and and she understood that the
fact that by nature civilizations that
are
you know whatever it is into the fit
into the six 10 to the seventh years
ahead of us thousands to millions
they&#39;re naturally going to have evolve
technologies that are going to look like
magic because let&#39;s face it if you went
back and visited Thomas Jefferson and
show them your smartphone or this
computer it would be something from
another it would be witchcraft to them
you know in 1700s so I think that that&#39;s
the other part of this is that we have
to realize that there&#39;s a certain amount
of humility that kicks in here where we
have to realize that there&#39;s very it&#39;s a
vast cosmos out there and it&#39;s likely
there are civilizations that are
extremely advanced beyond where we are
and all of their technologies are going
to be transdimensional or
interdimensional just by virtue of the
fact that if there&#39;s any aspiration to
go beyond your own solar system it&#39;s
extremely unlikely that can happen at
the speed of light or less it&#39;s just too
slow so that&#39;s where you think cross
into the this sort of nonlocality in
physics and some of the folks have
worked with and classified projects have
run labs that deal with the sciences of
not necessarily consciousness but
communication and teleportation
transportation that deal with these
transdimensional we&#39;re able to see into
the future shows that this consciousness
we&#39;re talking about has no time there is
there is no time right I was once
working with a physicist and she said
can&#39;t we do an experiment over the phone
to measure the speed of thought mister
interesting idea she was on the East
Coast and I suddenly realized well you
won&#39;t be able to tell whether I start my
experiment at 10 o&#39;clock or two minutes
before 10:00 or two minutes after 10:00
since you have perfect precognitive
abilities the meaning of the speed of
thought is is absent really about the
most common slightly experience that
most people have is a precognitive dream
you have a dream on Friday night and it
comes to pass on Saturday that are the
elephant in your garden Saturday morning
was the cause of your dreaming about an
elephant Friday night is retro causal so
that it&#39;s really independent of the
temporal distance so it was very very
impressed not only to see the UFO
circling around with you waves your
laser that shows that there are UFOs but
it also shows that they have the
intentionality of being here and
communicating with you that is these the
consciousness that&#39;s running the
spacecraft also is desirous of
communicating right and they do and I
think there&#39;s one that questions that
gets asked a lot is that what are they
waiting for I think I tell people
they&#39;re waiting from a response from our
species that isn&#39;t militarized or
violent but that it&#39;s with people who
are at least at a at an initial level
aware of the science of consciousness
and these other dimensions because
without that we&#39;re not going to be able
to understand all the different
phenomena at all because that&#39;s I think
that is the as I understand the future
the route science of the next thousand
years is the science of consciousness
once we get out of this current
conundrum of living like savages using
fossil fuels from the dinosaur era but
once we get past that we&#39;ll be able to
begin to realize that this is the real
pursuit that will be fascinating not
only innate abilities in consciousness
but the scientific scientific
applications thereof and and those
scientific applications are going to be
enormous ly important going forward a
hundred years a thousand years into the
future you know the space entity is
probably already caught on the idea that
human beings are very dangerous species
as human beings first response to seeing
a new creature as you want to know can I
eat it or could I mate with it mm-hmm
right or blow it up in this case yes and
now we have wit now we have the space
force out there so these are you know
these are all
shoes that are interrelated but at the
core this is why what we&#39;re what we&#39;re
trying to do with ce-5 and for those
listening there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new app
that just came out called the ce-5
contact app so if you put in CD 5
contact on your app store things you&#39;ll
see it and it trains people in the
meditation the remote viewing the
protocols the reason I think it&#39;s
important it&#39;s this sort of mass
consciousness effect that&#39;s been
described that an individual has a
certain effect but to people doing
things in a very unified or loving way
it&#39;s sort of an exponential effect it&#39;s
not a linear so there&#39;s an effect in in
that this time-space material world of
consciousness and even more so when
there are people connected doing things
together in incoherence yeah I agree
with that it&#39;s important we where
customers are talking about space and
time but it&#39;s very important the
take-home message to realize the four
consciousness there is no time things
happen instantaneously does not require
any time for things to happen in the
domain of consciousness right exactly
that&#39;s great well again we&#39;re about at a
time I want to thank you very much for
agreeing to be in close encounters of
the fifth kind and I want to recommend
everyone that they take a look at the
third eye spies a very fascinating
historical but also the information in
it that dr. Russell Russell targis
touched on is really important for
people to understand if they want to do
CFI properly and i want to thank you for
your long career in pursuing this
science and taking a very serious
scientific approach that connects our
time now to that the ancient times and
the ancient civilizations that live this
way as seers because that&#39;s our innate
capability thank you and I&#39;m very happy
to be here in support of your wonderful
film thank you very much have a good day
bye bye
