  Experience description: &nbsp;

Me and my boyfriend were extremely tired, because we had traveled all night, just for fun. Later we had a fight about serious subjects, so we went to bed very stressed.

We turned off the light, turned back one to the other and tried do fall asleep.. I think I was almost falling, and we naturally had moved one to the other. Suddenly I start feeling like floating, and I couldn't feel where my body ended and his started, I couldn't feel the contact between our skin (we were naked). His mouth was so much near mine that we were breathing the same air, lips almost touching. I felt float higher and I felt I wasn't in my room anymore. Than I felt his presence, and I found it wasn't separated from me.

I noticed it was all darker than usual. At the same time, I heard him say &quot;it's so dark, I'm not here, what's happening? Is it because of the dark?&quot;. I felt extremely surprised because I thought I was dreaming, but I understood that I was awaken and he was feeling the same. He said &quot;the air we're breathing, is getting heavy, and we're getting &quot;light&quot; (low weight)&quot;. I was thinking exactly what he was saying, and later he said that everything I said too, during that experience, was exactly what he was thinking. We were connected, we were the same, it was this what we concluded later.

We started do get frightened because he said he was going down, and I felt us separating and slowly went down into my body. We stayed in dark and silence, I was feeling so peaceful, so quiet, so happy! Then we started to talk and talked about what we had feel for hours and hours.    From that day, we have kind of a strong telepathic connection (we had some before, but not this way!). Now we believe in twin souls, in some kind of life after death and in Out of Body Experiences. 

 Any associated medications or substances with the potential to affect the experience?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

 Was the kind of experience difficult to express in words?    Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

 At the time of this experience, was there an associated life threatening event?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

 What was your level of consciousness and alertness during the experience? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Low at first, but when I started to feel something weird, I became   aware of what was happening, till I came back to my body. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was the experience dream like in any way?&nbsp;&nbsp;  only at first 

 Did you experience a separation of your consciousness from your body?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everything was do dark I couldn't see my body, but I felt like floating away from it, and I &quot;saw&quot; in my head a sphere of light, brighter on the center.

 Did you meet or see any other beings?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my boyfriend was with me, I couldn't see him or imagine his face because I couldn't associate it to HIM, his identity, the real him I was feeling. I wasn't ME, physical, too, I felt I was something immortal that had ever existed. Beyond that I couldn't exactly dissociate us one from the other, we were one. 

 Did you experiment while out of the body or in another, altered state?  Uncertain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

 Did you   observe or hear anything regarding people or events during your experience that could be verified later?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Uncertain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an experience with 2 people involved! My boyfriend remembers everything and felt the same, but he says he says he didn't see the bright sphere, he saw one person in a garden, at night, and that person was US, we were one. 

 Did you notice how your 5 senses were working, and if so, how were they different?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Uncertain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear, because we were talking. I couldn't feel the contact between our bodies,   but I could feel his breath in my lips. I couldn't see, it was too dark, I didn't tasted anything and I can't remember any smell. 

 Did you have any sense of altered space or time?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't say were I was and I have no idea of how much time we were in that state out of body.
