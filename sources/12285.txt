  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in such a bad place in my life.  I thought the only way out was to take my own life.  I asked God to forgive me for what I was about to do. I took a bottle of muscle-relaxers and drank a 40 ounce bottle of beer. I  laid on my bed, on my back  and waited to go to sleep. The next thing I felt was myself rising.  I remember thinking that I was going to hit the ceiling. Then I was above the ceiling still floating up. I looked down and saw my mom's house.  She lived just a few blocks from me. I always have dreams that I can fly but the tree limbs and telephone wires stop me and I fall.  But this time, I kept floating up and past the tree limbs and telephone wires.  

I floated up above the clouds. The next thing I remember is floating upright.  Two people who had died that year were a few feet away from me.  The father of my children and one of my friends held out their hands and told me to stop and that I couldn't come any closer. So, I stopped.  I saw millions of spirits. They were a ways behind Ernie and Elenore. One I recognized was my Grandpa. 

As I floated up, I felt all my bad feelings just fall off of me.  One by one, the hurt, anger, and all negative feelings fell off of me.  There was such a peaceful and sweet feeling that I cannot put into words.  I begged them to let me continue on, but they said I had to go back because I wasn't done yet. I started to fall.  As I did so, all those feelings came back onto me one by one. 

I then was awake in my bed. I just started to cry. But I know there is a heaven and I always try to remember that feeling of peace and love.
