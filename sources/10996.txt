Once I had been anesthetized, I suddenly found myself running down a long black tunnel. In fact, this was my soul leaving my body, running fast inside this tunnel so I could reach a white light, a bright ring. The very moment I reached the light, I turned around and, retracing my steps, ran back through the tunnel at the same speed, until I reached where I had started - only to turn around again and run back down the tunnel towards the light. Repeatedly, I ran towards the light, and then back to where I had started and then back towards the light again, over and over. While doing this, I enjoyed a feeling of serenity, peace and calm. 

Once I awoke after the surgery, I felt extremely tired, as if I had just run a great many kilometers! The feelings of 'detachment' and 'running fast' towards the light are the most difficult experiences to explain. It felt sort of like an emergency - back and forth, back and forth - as if a disaster were attracting me towards the light, but another was pulling me back towards my body.
