the recent research being done up at
Salt Lake City
I learned the last couple months they
have a basketball-sized device that can
teleport and travel and anti grab but
also they had a certain resonant
frequency in bang the laboratory filled
up with these interdimensional beings
that were visible they were videotaped
I&#39;m trying to get my hand on the
videotape from a National Security
Agency contact I have but that&#39;s just in
the last since March April and that was
that&#39;s been done in a private lab
privately funded what that lab doesn&#39;t
know is that they were doing it in
classified US government supported
unacknowledged special access labs in
the 50 60 70 s 80s okay you gotta
understand this stuff you&#39;re not going
to know what&#39;s going to happen what&#39;s
coming unless you do then there are
these little lovely experiences
psychotronic lee induce experiences with
AI and also holographic man-made beans
thought-form so these this isn&#39;t a whole
basket of technologies and about 1956 I
met with a man who was back in 93 94 was
in his 80s and he was sort of a very
much of an electromagnetic genius
prodigy back then and he developed a
system to couple systems one was a TAC
system technology assisted consciousness
system where you could switch it on hook
herself up to sort of like a headset and
go into a remote view state and see any
place you wanted to that was 56 a front
company for the CIA called alpha metric
corporation bought it up and black shell
didn&#39;t put it into their unacknowledged
exclusive use for certain highly
classified and why am I talking ed
Dame&#39;s type stuff I mean way past what
ed was exposed to so those systems were
50s 56 57 50
eight the he also said that they had
technologies were at a remote distance
they could target somebody and there&#39;s
thousands of miles away if they wished
and give them an experience with a being
that a hundred percent would seem real
it&#39;s almost like electromagnetic LSD or
electromagnetic ayahuasca but controlled
by the intelligence community so that
and he said I&#39;m quoting here he said if
we want to target someone so that they
have a personal conversation with their
personal God Jesus Buddha creat whoever
it is they all have it they&#39;ll think
it&#39;s real and they will absolutely pass
a lie-detector test that it&#39;s real
that&#39;s 50 s 60 some years ago you got to
get your mind around that in order to
understand people with the intent to
deceive have in their collection of
tools extraordinary sciences and
technologies that are classified now if
I had heard this stuff from one person
with credentials I would have questioned
it
but it&#39;s from dozens and dozens and
dozens of people who&#39;ve been in these
companies and in these agencies a lot of
the really high-end work of that is
being done it ISA will go through a list
East systems Raytheon EG&amp;G etc and so on
so that&#39;s what you have to understand
you know and and and the comical term
that&#39;s used at the CIA by the people I
know they&#39;re currently it&#39;s WS FM weird
science and freakin magic but North
Lockheed Martin I mean at Northrop
Grumman they just call it pfm pure effin
magic that&#39;s what the engineers call it
it absolutely looks like magic so that
is that is what we&#39;re dealing with now
let&#39;s go to the next slide and we&#39;re
gonna get into more detail just to much
be following yeah a little big time for
question later
so when you look at the covert
intelligence communities you saps you
have to divide them into two general
area you have advanced physics and these
are things that you can think of that
are very 3d 4d you know a are these
electromagnetic devices program life
forms that are robotic creatures that
are bio nano genetics by the way that
say the art lab for that is Dulce not
cannot get to it by being anywhere near
Dulce there&#39;s a connector from Los
Alamos underground and also some other
ug B&#39;s we&#39;ll get into that in a moment
where the underground system is
connected but these are the ones that
are really where the action is
transdimensional physics both passive
and active now the reason I divide these
into passive and active systems is that
the passive systems are for intelligence
gathering and spycraft the active
systems are for disruption and staging
things does that make sense so as we
look at these passive systems you&#39;re
looking at the sort of things that if
you were to develop electromagnetic
interdimensional spycraft and it&#39;s way
past prism or the Monroe Institute when
I say way past way way past prism was
Snowden revealed NSA eavesdropping thing
those are using electromagnetic linear
and these are systems that as I
mentioned have electromagnetic assisted
remote viewing and into the conscious
realm and those allow spy craft to take
place free of any tap or electromagnetic
monitoring of telecommunication what&#39;s
called signals intelligence not
necessary and this is why everyone who
works with me when they first start
working with me they go oh we need to
send everything encrypted and we need
this and we actually don&#39;t bother by
time the thought has left your cerebral
cortex it&#39;s been grabbed
by these technologies now might one of
my military advisors for many years was
a naval commander and he back when the
the White Oaks Naval facility was
operative it&#39;s closed now in Maryland he
saw a device that he was called a white
noise space-time electromagnetic
extraction system and what that was is
that it was a device that could target
anywhere any volume of space say the
volume in this room and say the device
is there near Bethesda in Maryland they
could target the volume of this room and
monitor anything going on now or that
happened here last night a hundred years
ago a thousand years ago a million years
ago a billion years ago it&#39;s called the
white noise of space time the Mystics
call it the Akashic record so encoded
within the fabric of space time is
everything that has ever happened is
still there as a standing energy
waveform that can be extracted by this
system and that was in the 70s and it
had been fully operational long before
he got there called the white noise
space-time extraction okay do you
understand what that is so yes so we can
it can target it but it&#39;s actually
pulling events and information and
intelligence out of the structure of
space-time and can target any volume
anywhere so this is why I say you know
Snowden I told his lawyers said don&#39;t he
made a very big mistake disclosing lame
stuff like prism and the conventional
NSA fiber-optic going in to Google and
Facebook the big action is this stuff
and this that&#39;s why the anyone who wants
to work with me I say forget about
encryption forget about secrecy ain&#39;t
gonna work because if you had a trillion
dollars you couldn&#39;t frustrate these
systems now the and then there are
others that have been developed or
they&#39;re trying to develop so-called prod
redlight that&#39;s based on a study in
extraterrestrial communication devices
that can also look into the future or
get a sense of future events those are
in development and or less precise but
that&#39;s only because all future events
are only probabilities so let me explain
what I mean by that everything that we
think and do at this moment is changing
the future and so if in this point in
time you see an event in the future by
the time you&#39;ve seen it if you&#39;ve shared
that information it can change that
event does this make sense so you know
it may have a 95 percent likelihood it
may have a 99 percent it may be a 80
percent but it&#39;s not going to be a
hundred percent the ones looking in the
real time now or backward like the white
noise extraction systems those are
extremely accurate okay so those are all
passive systems that and there are many
others that have been developed since
the 50s 60s 70s certainly by the 60s and
70s these were all fully operational
okay so you&#39;re not gonna learn this in
your physics class or your government
class that the caller put into college
here but you&#39;re learning it today and
it&#39;s I&#39;m telling you the truth now this
is of these are worrisome just because
they&#39;re very unacknowledged special
access projects by systems these are
where the big my bigger concern is and
these active transdimensional systems
deal with the ability to perturb or
induce phenomenon from other realms and
dimensions I mentioned that a moment ago
where they could set up an
electromagnetic vector into another
dimension and cause a phenomena in the
day place that would not only fool
everyone but could be very injurious to
the earth one of these systems I&#39;ve been
told
recently has been deployed in the past
that be set up over certain tectonic
fault lines to induce earthquakes and
earth changes and these are actively
being deployed very dangerous game being
played there&#39;s why these these events
are coming are gonna be not just natural
but man-made unnatural keep that in mind
as things start unfolding they&#39;re in the
hands of some of the worst elements
possible which is why I said 25 years
ago the disclosure of this subject and
getting these technologies under the
control of conscious ethical people is
of the utmost importance to the human
future and it is an existential crisis
that it is in the hands of the people
that&#39;s in they have had the ability to
do teleportation since the 50s maybe
forties you&#39;ve all heard the
Philadelphia Experiment was in actually
in Philadelphia it was in Rhode Island
but that was a cover story the but the
long story short is the ability to cause
an object to switch and fall out of one
point in space and appear at another
that has been done in MA
fairly recently with particles in
physics that&#39;s been reported in
mainstream physics journals but what you
need to know is through very high
voltage and electromagnetic frequency
field systems it began to be studied and
practice and experimented with in the
40s and 50s one of our disclosure
project witnesses fred threat fell was
up at a base up in Canada there was
classified Air Force facility where they
had this big room and they sounds too
prosaic but they had an ashtray and the
ashtray would be on a box and it had
this electromagnetic field and it would
dematerialize Andrea materialized on
another part of the base and they could
just teleport it back and forth an
ashtray that was in 53 1953 so these
sort of Sciences transdimensional
physics and Sciences have been developed
over the last 60 70 years at this point
in 2018 they&#39;re extraordinarily well
developed in the classified world and
they can stage pretty much anything they
want which is what they&#39;re doing the it
also means they can materialize and
dematerialize objects they can weaponize
these international these
interdimensional portals or so-called
stargates now this is the thing that is
most concerning to me is that all
interstellar extraterrestrial
civilization are crossing through these
finer dimensions to get here they&#39;re not
going through linear solid space-time
but in over the last 3040 years they
developed the ability to weaponize say
up a vector or a portal into these other
dimensions and then create a weapon
system that can target other starcraft
other planetary systems and
what-have-you this is very dangerous in
the hands of people who have the
intention to utilize them and this is of
great concern to all of us and the other
are the satellite based systems back in
the 70s I met the man who was very
brilliant electromagnetic engineer had
his own company and Tampa&#39;s named Pete
area who had developed what he called a
neutrino light detector
these are detectors that are placed on
satellites that can pick up an ET craft
when it&#39;s coming out of interdimensional
transdimensional space-time into this
dimension and it leaves a certain
signature and it&#39;s not conventional
light it&#39;s a neutrino kind of light
scatter but in the shape and form and
vector of the spacecraft that is then
slaved as they call to weapon systems
that are both in space on satellites and
on the ground to target the ET craft and
hit it with a very powerful
electromagnetic weapon which is how we
mean causing these crash retrieval
events to happen so you&#39;re not going
through billions of miles or light-years
of space and getting
and running out of gas and crashing I
mean you know or some you know an
electrical storm they don&#39;t know how to
maneuver through no left 737s can go
around electrical storms there they&#39;re
being targeted with these weapons that
are faster than the speed of light
because they are what are called scalar
or longitudinal so it quick study in
that wave like what you&#39;re seeing has a
wave function right so the wave function
is 186,000 miles per second propagating
scalar or longitudinal it&#39;s a point in a
line and it doesn&#39;t have a wave function
and it is multiples of the speed of
light those scalar systems or
longitudinal systems have been developed
since the 40s 50 60 s and have been
weaponized that was what was in the
little secret radar dome you know the
FBI memo that we got has now become the
number one viewed document on the FBI
website from the field agent to jeger
Hoover about the Roswell event where it
says apparently they switched on a quote
new radar system and it down in these
things craft it wasn&#39;t radar the way you
think of radar at Denver International
Airport it that term radar just so you
know is a euphemism used in
unacknowledged special access projects
to denote these sort of specialized
pulsed electromagnetic weapons systems
and they call them radar it&#39;s a
euphemism so these have been developed
and were deployed in the 70s there were
systems in the 60s that were present in
space but they didn&#39;t they weren&#39;t as
accurate because they didn&#39;t have these
very subtle
neutrino light detectors on them and of
course then you have the land air and
sea based systems that aren&#39;t in space
that have these interdimensional and
scalar electromagnetic weapons a good
example would be nearer Eglin Air Force
Base there&#39;s an area of beach there
that&#39;s classified and they have these
big horseshoe shaped objects that are
connected
satellite tracking systems and when they
pick up when they have picked up ET
craft coming in they&#39;ll switch it on and
hit it with the equivalent of something
much more powerful than an EMP
electromagnetic pulse like you&#39;d get
from a nuclear weapon but it&#39;s very
directional and it will disable the ET
craft and it&#39;ll drop straight out of the
sky into the Gulf and they&#39;ll go and
retrieve it I know people have been on
those retrieval teams yeah you now
understand why the head of the Defense
Intelligence Agency the three-star
general I&#39;ve met with at in the first 10
minutes said doctor we don&#39;t know why
you haven&#39;t committed suicide yet that
was his first question why haven&#39;t you
and then there are the mind conscious
interface weapons these are ones you
know that get into radionics
psychotronic disruptors very worrisome
because if you take you know the concept
of Technology interfacing with mind and
consciousness and you were to weaponize
it then you can create a system that not
only gathers intelligence but disrupts
peoples function or a level of
consciousness or can induce as I
mentioned earlier hallucinogenic
abduction States but also importantly
can disrupt amity disrupt relationships
there was a woman back in 93 or 94 who I
met with for about a week who had worked
in one of these corporations and he says
look we have devices and we can turn a
dial target a board meeting in New York
City and have the board come to the
decision we want them to come to or we
can turn the dial the other way everyone
in the room is fighting with each other
hating each other it goes come out and
these are very well developed systems
sounds like tinfoil hat stuff and that&#39;s
what they want you to believe but those
systems have been fully operational also
since the 50s and 60s
so that this is just sort of a quick
overview of the constellation of types
of technologies I think you&#39;re getting
the gist of this everything you&#39;ve
learned is wrong about this subject
most of it is stagecraft you have to
have this information to go to the next
level of what you need to do and that&#39;s
to become an interplanetary ambassador
to these civilizations because I don&#39;t
think it&#39;s going to happen out of the US
State Department or the UN any time soon
and it is very important that you not
give any power to this but you have to
be aware of it and what do I mean by
that the consciousness within us and
that the central Sun of reality that
state of conscious being it&#39;s that&#39;s so
much more powerful than these toys but
you have to access that state to
frustrate them
that&#39;s this pnath Shambhala warrior
spirit warrior you have to understand
the power of the consciousness within
you and the conscious mind that you&#39;re
awake
with right now is actually seamlessly
integrated to the unbounded infinite
mind of the great being at all times in
all places so you can connect to that
transcend your own ego and individuality
and fear and intellect and connect to
that and that is the ultimate protection
but it&#39;s also the ultimate source of
guidance wisdom discernment it&#39;s why I
said I was a very good thing I became a
meditation teacher and a student of the
Vedas and and the cities and what have
you before I got involved with this
because otherwise I would have been lost
for sure probably killed too
so this is very important for you to
understand as a sort of Millia sort of
the the prevailing environment that is
extant it&#39;s out there its operational
it&#39;s fully operational and it&#39;s being
deployed all the time
it&#39;s the stock and trade of most things
ufological
so I think we have to begin to I had
someone say to me once well you&#39;re
really a skeptic about most I said no
but it&#39;s not a skepticism it&#39;s about
knowledge I&#39;ve known all of this since
the early in mid-90s terrible well you
know and of course what do you do when
you&#39;re you know meeting with a
politician and I had you know I had
dinner last night before last before I
flew out here with the one of the main
editor of Politico and a former
ambassador under Bill Clinton and some
people in DC I have a home in DC and I
meet with a lot of these kind of folks
and you know you&#39;re trying to bring them
up to et and UFO 101a that they even
exist but they need to know this but
they don&#39;t and it&#39;s a huge learning
curve it&#39;s vertical and we have all of
us have got to go through this learning
curve very quickly so we don&#39;t get
fooled again
imagine this constellation of
technologies being deployed to simulate
an alien attack simulate abductions
mutilations and as dr. Altschuler was a
wonderful man who lived here and in
Denver no I&#39;d stay at his home and he
was a remember the snippy the horse the
original mutilated animal thing that was
him that was the doctor who studied
research and the delete 668 or some he
says oh yeah he says I discovered those
were covert paramilitary programs doing
those back in the late 60s nobody would
listen I say of course they are we know
how they&#39;re doing it why they&#39;re doing
it
it&#39;s really funny everyone that the
aliens are up there mutilating the
catalyze right
I know exactly who&#39;s doing it where
they&#39;re doing it where they&#39;re operating
out of what technologies they&#39;re using
and they&#39;ve been doing it since the
sixties now to the hysterical public
the aliens are mutilating our cattle and
women folk and they&#39;re doing this and
they&#39;re doing that I&#39;m going yeah well
they&#39;re alien but they&#39;re not
extraterrestrial go back to the previous
slide and you&#39;ll see alien is a
catch-all so what part of this is
extraterrestrial what part of it is
interdimensional what part of it
innately interdimensional and what part
of it is man-made simulators using very
advanced technologies that who knows how
many trillions of dollars at least eight
trillion in one Michigan State
University study recently 21 trillion
dollars in covert money have gone into
our entire national debt by the way
would be all set if we could call back
the 21 trillion that have been embezzled
into these projects yep
so it&#39;s a lot of money and with it comes
a lot of Technology and a lot of
brilliant people the smartest people I
have ever met on this planet
that are not et have been people who
have been identified in high school in
college and pulled into a you SAP
unacknowledged special access project
IQs two hundred and North I mean just
geniuses and what a waste because
they&#39;re spending their lives working for
these fascists who have an agenda of
World War three being interplanetary
just as brno von Braun warned on his
deathbed so if you take all of this in
the aggregate and realize that people
said when there&#39;s a false flag gonna
happen I saw whether it started in the
50s the false flag operations third in
the 50s when they developed alien
reproduction vehicles gravity control
then do started doing stage craft
simulating and et Encounters that scared
people etc and so on 50 60 70 s 80s 90s
till now it&#39;s all been part of an
acculturation and brainwashing and
counterintelligence so that people when
they raid
the button bang would say will be for
convinced that whatever that is is an
actual hostile alien invasion that&#39;s the
the basis of it now you&#39;ve all heard
that President Trump recently called for
the formation of a space force and all
right now wait wait wait wait I&#39;m a
little long in the tooth or getting old
I&#39;ll be 63 next week terrifying idea
imagine having me as a grandfather
anyway and doing but it&#39;s a frightening
thought that or father for that matter
but you know the space force it what
he&#39;s really doing is acknowledging
something that already exists all right
whether he knows that or not I don&#39;t
know I doubt it the the people the men
and women I have dealt with for the last
25 or more years who&#39;ve been in these
projects have been in an opera Tate
operational command Space Command and
elsewhere that have satellite systems
first deployed in the 60s that could
target ET craft and have been refined
and refined and refined we&#39;re on like
the 200 generation I don&#39;t know a
refinement of those technologies over
the last 60 years 50 to 60 years but
those exist already now of course what
he wants to do is form a sixth branch of
acknowledged branch and with what I&#39;m
concerned about is the people who are
maneuvering him to do so are people who
want to who are getting ready for this
false flag threat alien invasion thing
that of course we were warned about by
Verner von Braun in the 70s and nobody
listened but I think that that&#39;s I think
an open preparation I don&#39;t think that
he&#39;s read into this so let me explain
and print what President
intelligence briefings at at least
extent I&#39;ve been involved since Papa
Bush in 91 - and Clinton onwards is that
the people who are read in heavily or
people who came into the presidency or
vice presidency the case of Papa Bush or
Cheney from the committee who were who
had come along through their careers but
most presidents say above oh I mean Bill
Clinton a Bubba came in as a governor
from Arkansas he wanted to be read into
this was denied access his CIA director
was denied access subsequently he was
kind of told leave this alone and when
you&#39;re an ex-president we&#39;ll read you in
which is what happened they didn&#39;t trust
him in the Oval Office having the
information in other words his CIA
director that I briefed ended up
betraying everyone getting a position
with Booz Allen Hamilton which is a big
contractor that deals with this and
other things and took sort of the golden
parachute most people if they&#39;re
threatened enough or if they&#39;re given
enough inducements or both you see us
both will take the buyout ninety to the
head of Army Intelligence offered me
personally to two billion with a B
dollars to defect I wouldn&#39;t do it so
it&#39;s most people are gonna take the two
billion
but I think I always say what all this
boils down to is integrity you know and
courage and you gotta have both and the
courage is a lot to ask for from a
politician
never mind integrity but they know that
the people who are on the majority
Intelligence Committee that handles all
this there are dozens and dozens of
unacknowledged special access projects
that deal with this
they are sort of silos for example the
gentleman who recently came forward he
was given baseline clearance it&#39;s called
across 18 of them but they&#39;re out of
6,000 people he wasn&#39;t there were only
three people that had baseline clearance
across them so they&#39;re using very very
compartment it isolated one of the
things that he shared with me which was
very interesting is the fact that
there&#39;s a facility near Walton Oklahoma
near Fort Sill where there&#39;s an
underground base that has these one of
the spacecraft that was downed
apparently in the 80s or 90s that is
being studied to figure out how it
cloaks and you know he has seen that
facility there&#39;s also a facility that
where we downed an ET craft outside
Seoul South Korea and they had the bore
huge facility into a mountain and
there&#39;s an ET craft there there&#39;s a
facility in Irvine California that looks
like office part but you go way
underground and there&#39;s a facility where
they&#39;re studying the extraterrestrial
bodies there&#39;s all kinds of facilities
and operations some of which I knew
about and some I did not and what was
fascinating to me is that you know this
man had been in the Army as a career
person retired and got rehired as a
civilian and then and only then was read
into these projects and he didn&#39;t even
know what an unacknowledged special
access project was but when he saw this
movie he went this man knows what he&#39;s
talking about so he was pulled into
what&#39;s called the team
technology management office of the
Pentagon let&#39;s go to the next slide and
this is a couple of just sort of this is
by no means comprehensive I just wanted
to give you an idea of where some of
these facilities are and you know kind
of where they&#39;re how they&#39;re structured
there there&#39;s an entire Edwards base and
related facilities on the left here
Edwards Air Force Base in the high
desert of California and you have these
various a haystack Butte is a specific
place it has an underground facility
underneath that China Lakes George
Norton has been decommissioned a
tabletop Mountain and blackjack control
interesting blackjack control is at
Edwards the top-secret document is the
National Reconnaissance Office which is
the office that runs all the
super-secret spy satellites mentions
blackjack operation but blackjack
control and that&#39;s out of Nellis
so-called area 51 that and but blackjack
control is actually at the edwards
facility now what you need to know is
that you can go into an underground
connector at edwards and i know people
who have done this in their jobs connect
to an underground tunneling system and
surface at Nellis alright
so he&#39;s being being Bechtel corporation
I&#39;ve mentioned there&#39;s a nuclear-powered
tunneling device that bores through
solid bedrock and classifies it and then
they put these high-speed
electromagnetic transport systems and so
people can surface go go underneath the
surface of the earth at one point and
appear at another point in the
continental United States was sort of
honeycombed with a number of these
tunnels and underground facilities one
thing to keep in mind nothing that is
mission-critical is on the surface of
the earth it is either underground or in
space if it&#39;s above a nuclear blast zone
surface of the earth or an asteroid hit
level of the surface
the earth it is not critical or if it&#39;s
critical it&#39;s got a mirror facility
underground that&#39;s what the COG is
continuity of government you know what
that is cop cog no you know if a nuclear
weapon went off and took out the whole
government in Washington there&#39;s a
continuously running system they used to
be in mount weather and it&#39;s near there
now in action on 9/11 a Senator John
Warner who&#39;s on this committee of the
majority intelligence committee was
taken by intelligence community agents
and taken into an underground connector
in under the Capitol and whisked out to
mount weather on an underground system
on 9/11 because he was a critical asset
I mean the rest of the Senators weren&#39;t
but some a couple but the ones were on
the committee so and so and then you
have aerospace facilities that are at
Edwards you have the Northrop&#39;s anthill
tea huntin ranch McDonnell Douglas LA no
plant Lockheed Martin Hillandale plant
Phillips lab these are all facilities
where ARV so-called alien reproduction
vehicle man-made flying saucers and
triangles are made you all have heard of
the Nellis complex it&#39;s called area 51
but it&#39;s actually areas s4s 12 mesa an
area 19 or ki hoot Mesa is a Mesa and
underneath is where the state-of-the-art
research lab is studying
extraterrestrial materials are located
and groom Lake the tests late range out
on that area 51 site you see it&#39;s really
called the Nevada Test range in New
Mexico you have met Los Alamos National
Laboratories they have a compartmented
operation that deals with this but more
importantly a member of my team for many
years was a senior engineer at Los
Alamos and he was in the locker room and
he was hearing some men talk about the
fact they had just come back out of
Dulce through the underground connector
so Los Alamos has an underground
connector system to the Four Corners
area and a lot of people
they&#39;re like UFO hunters and they go
there&#39;s nothing there on the ground well
no there isn&#39;t
there&#39;s no egress there&#39;s no access
there&#39;s no regress it&#39;s all through
underground elsewhere but it&#39;s in that
area and that&#39;s where a lot of the POF
SARM a program life forms the so-called
aliens the ones that are running around
where we grow them is out there which is
why they were killing getting a lot of
the raw materials from all the cattle
they&#39;re mutilating in northern New
Mexico you know this story oh well we
could go on for days but anyway so
that&#39;s that&#39;s the Los Alamos and Dulce
complexes you have you know Kirkland Air
Force Base of course has had a stark
connection but Sandia National Labs
specifically has studied this issue and
the Phillips lab facility Manzano
mountain weapons storage facilities
underground Coyote Canyon test site and
then of course and this is white sands
is actually a separate New Mexico
facility white census its own facility
quite far away from Kirtland that was
graphic graphic because a little mistake
in there goes our the next slide and
I&#39;ll show you some more is this
interesting to spy on all these new in
Arizona I&#39;ve had some people couple
people recent man just contacted us who
had worked at that facility years ago a
gentleman who had been in the
underground facility there had worked in
the compartmented operation where there
were nine separate et spacecraft that
over the years had been down taken there
and then they had an underground morgue
for all the et bodies all the ETS they
had were skilled and and we&#39;re in
storage there so that Fort Huachuca is
actually also an NSA facility in a Fort
Huachuca Arizona it Kinnear tombstone
ironically all these dead et&#39;s and
crafts there it&#39;s also army intelligence
headquarters it&#39;s at Fort Huachuca way
out in the desert and there are others
of course out in this Cheyenne Mountain
the Colorado Deep Space Network here in
Colorado has a significant research
and there&#39;s an Air Force Base connected
underground out further east I&#39;m
blocking on the name yeah yeah
traitor that is very connected to this
program you have the Lawrence Livermore
labs in California Pine Gap facility in
Australia they&#39;re both magic and
Australian but it&#39;s really run by us I
was at a briefing with a 120 world
leaders on an island in the Great
Barrier Reef about five years ago and
this Minister of Defence for Australia
was there and he was very curious
because the mistake people make they
always the minister of defence of
Australia he&#39;d know everything going on
in his backyard no he doesn&#39;t because
these are unacknowledged special access
projects that he was not read into so it
was a very interesting series of
conversations and by the way it&#39;s very
disturbing I mean if you&#39;re the Minister
of Defence or the president or prime
minister or CIA director and you find
out that there&#39;s this enormous and most
important technological and strategic
activity in the history of the human
race going on that you&#39;re not read into
you&#39;re pissed off and but you&#39;re scared
it&#39;s frightening and it and it is
frightening now the Redstone Arsenal
there&#39;s a facility there in Alabama
associated with the transdimensional
research I&#39;ve been in one of the labs
there asked if a secured communication
information facility skiff and other
amazing technologies that are being
developed there as well as associated
with the Marshall Space Flight Center
the gentleman who&#39;s recently surfaced
from the technology management office in
the sub-basement the Pentagon said that
he went down the Marshall Space Flight
Center in this area and was read into
the state-of-the-art killer satellite
systems that have been put into space
that could and he used the word
obliterate anything in space and it&#39;s
very worrisome of course if I
all kinds of treaties but these are
illegal unacknowledged special access
projects I don&#39;t care what the law is
and then you have the the Utah complex
not far from solving city it&#39;s
accessible only by air dub way proving
grounds outside Provo has also
classified airspace an underneath dug
way is I think probably the most
state-of-the-art facility more so than
so-called area 51 or Edwards which are
older facilities this also happens to be
where the new NSA data center was built
you see this big gleaming multi hundred
million dollar building above ground but
there&#39;s a lot beneath ground and and of
course here you get you know just some a
list of the alphabet soup of agencies
involved Air Force CIA DARPA Defense
Intelligence the DARPA Defense Advanced
Research Project Administration FBI all
branches of the military have various
divisions dealing with this probably the
crown jewel is oh and I also Naval
Intelligence and Navy earth is
two-thirds covered with water yeah and
we have a lot of assets that are
underwater and that are doing things
under the oceans connected to et and
also our own underwater UFOs that are
man-made that zip around national of the
NASA has a very compartmented division
that deals with this and the National
Reconnaissance Office I mentioned before
they are tasked with all the top-secret
satellites but the compartment that
deals with this issue would also have
the killer satellites and ones with the
neutrino light detectors and the weapon
systems on them of course the National
Security Agency has some compartment and
operations dealing with this and the
various space commands which are now of
course Trump&#39;s calling for the space
force the technology management office
in the sub-basement of the Pentagon&#39;s
been around for a long time
it&#39;s way deep underneath the Pentagon
it&#39;s an unacknowledged area there&#39;s a
facility here in Irvine at your i-5 and
Forest Lakes Boulevard looks like an
office park and that&#39;s where there&#39;s a
big underground research facility for
the et bodies and I mentioned this
underground base near Fort Sill Oklahoma
where there&#39;s an et crap being studied
for its cloaking or materialization
dematerialization abilities and then
mentioned before soaked South Korea the
Research Triangle Park of North Carolina
has an army science research center
there dr. Rayburn Scott and others
what&#39;s interesting about that is that
you know people don&#39;t realize that the
Research Triangle Park North Carolina is
the highest number of PhDs
anywhere in the world and there are a
lot of classified facilities in that
area in my home state and I mentioned
the NRO neutrino lights and then there
are many others so one of the things
that I try to as I go through all of
that and you get your minds around it is
is to understand that it&#39;s it&#39;s
decentralized it&#39;s compartmented but
it&#39;s also very scattered into different
fiefdoms so you have a naval fiefdom and
you have an airforce fiefdom you have a
CIA and they don&#39;t always get along at
all all right and then you have nesco
the next slide the corporate fiefdoms
sort of feudal warlords and this is
where you get into of course the a whole
lot of companies that you&#39;ve heard of
some you may not have bae systems this
is british but they are very involved in
BDM corporation beck tail does a lot of
the underground base and contracting for
these facilities construction i actually
admit
Stephen Bechtel years ago Booz Allen
Hamilton that&#39;s who the contractor was
that Snowden worked for that you know
but and then CI a-- director Woolsey
that I had briefed ended up becoming
Council for but they are very involved
in in the et research area Boeing has a
compartment at operation EG&amp;G which is
has a plant on the edge of the Nellis
range they do a lot of the in fact the
early early anti-gravity craft that we
built that were man-made were EG&amp;G this
one east systems which is now part of
Raytheon the brothers I knew the
executives at East systems and they were
telling me about the kind of
technologies they had that had to do
with these electromagnetic weapon
systems and mental interface and all
kinds of transdimensional systems and
the two brothers that have found that e
systems were not getting along and so
rather than let that split apart and
have the Box open up to the public
Raytheon vault them
Lockheed Martin they at various
facilities including in the Denver
Research Center here has a component
that deals with the extra-terrestrial
facility search it&#39;s compartmented
McDonnell Douglas has become part of
Boeing mitre corporation North American
Rockwell Northrop Phillips lab Raytheon
TRW and many others all these
corporations have a piece of the pie and
they get it for example I know a man who
was an auditor for the US government
looking into north of grummons books and
there was a huge amount of unaccounted
for spending and he was told these this
is a need-to-know basis you don&#39;t have
it need to know so he basically just
rubber stamped the accounting so what
happens is that the money is run a
little bit like a mafia now not on this
list and it could be another list are
affiliated criminal
in our prices okay all I&#39;m aces there&#39;s
just affiliated criminal enterprises and
these aces are ones that deal with the
movement of drugs around the world
weapons arms merchants things of this
sort so weapons of mass destruction
things like this that&#39;s real it&#39;s not a
conspiracy theory the day before I was
going to brief the head of intelligence
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff I was
asked to go to a meeting crystal city
right near the Pentagon with a former
member of Congress who was one of George
Bush seniors consiglio days I mean one
of his real advisers but a man who also
had and although I should have had on
this list
SAIC science applications international
corporation so he was an executive with
SAIC science applications international
corporation and he told me he said you
realize how dangerous this group is I
say yeah I&#39;m quite aware of it and he
said well there are there&#39;s an army and
this was back in 97 21 years ago there&#39;s
an army about 8,000 men that do nothing
but move contraband and drugs around the
world and classified airspace and craft
classified aircraft and we have already
killed 2,000 of them one quarter of them
for minor suspected security breaches he
says and this is why it this guy had
just retired gone to France this SAIC
executive but it creates an enormous
cash flow because the global drug trade
converse arrivals oil trade but except
it&#39;s not on the books so you have black
money from the US government that goes
in these projects from every not just
the military intelligence Homeland
Security CIA but also from HUD as
Kathryn Olsen Fitz and others have
described but you also then have these
aces these these affiliated criminal
enterprises that are tied into these
acknowledged special access projects
that create not only operational nexus
with gangs and what-have-you but also an
enormous amount of revenue and income
extremely dangerous so he asked me he
said are you you know aren&#39;t you
concerned I said well yes I I do I know
about this already and I know an
investigator who had uncovered there in
California there was a Marine officer
who had spotted like three or four in
the morning one of these covert flights
coming in to a base and unfortunately
saw that they were unloading large
amounts of drugs and he reported it and
ended up being killed made to look like
a suicide but I said that this was you
know III know this is goes on and has
been going on for decades but it creates
an enormous amount of untraceable black
money like budget money so those are
more even more shadowy than these
outfits and unfortunately the public is
you know one of the reasons them in my
opinion is a public health concern
medical doctor that drugs are illegal is
that they want to maintain the monopoly
from these criminal enterprises as every
study has shown that criminalizing drugs
of any kind is actually
counterproductive but of course makes it
very expensive and very exclusive for a
certain criminal element which would
redound to the benefit of the darker end
of this operation so this is sort of
what sort of a quick two hour trip
through the classified world the
facilities there&#39;s certainly much more
information the key takeaway here is the
technologies that seem like sound like
would look like magic that could deceive
you and the public have been developed
since the 40s and 50s and so there&#39;s an
L in the back of your mind as things
begin to unfold over the next months to
a few years keep that in mind at all
times
keep it in mind at all times on the
other hand there are extraterrestrial
civilizations that are observing this
but we have created a very big problem
and I don&#39;t often talk about this but
this is something that certainly those
of you doing the Close Encounters of the
fifth kind of Nishat of which is our
ambassador team that goes out and makes
peaceful contact with these
civilizations needs to know this is that
these civilizations do want to interface
with us but they&#39;re likely to interface
with us most in these other dimensions
because when they come into 3d they are
tracked targeted and hit now we have had
one almost disaster at Mount Shasta a
few years ago and we had a luminous
light ship that was emerging up from the
volcano towards us and we all got up and
were communicating with it and suddenly
we from a very high altitude airborne
craft there was a burst of energy just
before that the et crafty materialized
but this energy crashed into the woods
about 200 yards in front of us ripping
down all the trees limbs and you could
hear it and then it went into the earth
15 seconds shaking the earth I was
expecting to see a mushroom cloud
nothing it was a it was a directional
scalar electromagnetic weapon but so one
of the things that has become a problem
is that we&#39;re doing this as people
wanting to move the planet forward into
an era of universal peace and
enlightenment but within the context of
all this all this rubbish so we&#39;re let&#39;s
call it the theater of operation earth
is an armed camp and so we have to do it
with that in our mind it doesn&#39;t stop us
and it most certainly doesn&#39;t stop that
these very advanced ET civilizations
from interact
with us because they can come in in a
transdimensional form and then
materialize briefly and then D
materialize and then communicate with us
for hours while we&#39;re sitting out in the
desert happens all the time every single
week we go out anywhere amazing but it
ain&#39;t what you think it&#39;s very advanced
consciousness and also physics going on
and we&#39;ll have electromagnetic devices
out there that we start and we have
cameras you may have seen from the
webinar last month that we did in
Arizona of this ET beam that appeared in
our circle in Arizona about this time
last year and we have a great photograph
of it and all that was seen with the
naked eye was a burst of sort of a red
sphere and but the camera was open the
lens was open and here is this ETS or
triangular shaped head large sort of a
tunic on the chest and appeared next to
this man in a older gentleman who had
had a permanent hearing loss for many
years and he continued to have contact
with that et all throughout the night
and the next morning he came crying into
the session and said my hearing is
totally normal and it is still so we
have amazing experiences with these ETS
that are actually very compassionate
very enlightened and really incredible
civilizations they get a bad rap because
of what I call alien ism which is that
slide where I showed all the things that
are thought of as alien that are being
man-made or not et or other dimensions
but I tell people if you enter into this
state of consciousness a deep meditative
state and connect to the great
consciousness the cosmic mind there are
such protection there there&#39;s such
clarity there and if you&#39;re intent and
your heart is I hate to use the word
pure but if you have a clear and pure
intent of why you&#39;re there these
civilizations will contact you they&#39;re
not interested in people who just are
curious and they&#39;re not interested in
people who are wanting to get their
technologies or shoot them down and
they&#39;re not interested in racists
now what do I mean by that what has
happened is the the human roots of
racism are very well known it goes all
the way back to the part of us that are
monkeys that organizing the warring
troops because one&#39;s a little different
from the other
so this tribalism that has infected the
human situation is sort of the original
sin of humanity where one group kills
another and organizes against one
another and what&#39;s called warfare for
one silly reason or another religious
ethnic racial better than that a lot
this is now being deliberately exploited
by the intelligence community through
their technologies into eight what I
call alien ism the new racism this is
not politically correct well I don&#39;t
know in some circles now you never know
to be overtly racist or to be overtly
homophobic or overtly misogynist or
overtly anti-semitic or whatever it is
but it is okay to be overtly alien ism
racist and so the interplanetary racism
is what they&#39;re developing to replace
the planetary racism and tribalism and
that&#39;s being done very very well very
carefully through UFO community through
the New Age community through the media
through books through movies through
what-have-you and through their stage
craft so we have to sort of step back
take a look at this and go hmm what&#39;s
really going on here and not get fooled
again with that I want to emphasize I am
NOT saying that all civilizations from
other star systems are happy with us I
would say they are quite unhappy not
with the earth and humanity per se but
with the direction the planet is going
in that&#39;s a big distinction because when
we first started detonating atomic
weapons and then developing these other
classified faster than the speed of
light weapons and deploying them in the
space
this became an existential threat to
them to them
there are planetary systems out there
that are interplanetary in their
capabilities that don&#39;t even have a
concept in their bio evolutionary track
of war or murder it&#39;s just not there
like we do from monkeys so we have to
understand that if you were to look
through et&#39;s eyes and step out into
space and look at the last hundred and
fifty years or 100 years of this planet
where we&#39;ve gone from you know muskets
and what-have-you
to thermonuclear weapons and other
weapons and now these use apps that have
these amazingly advanced but potentially
interstellar reaching weapon systems you
could understand why they&#39;d be less than
amused now this is not to say don&#39;t
conflate this as a simplistic statement
it means that there are civilizations
out there that are providing a check in
a balance and also they have a plan
another whole plan that&#39;s called Plan B
and that is in the event that we cannot
get this planet under control and moving
on to a level one civilization as Michio
Kaku calls you know a peaceful
civilization that&#39;s not destroying its
biosphere that could be universally at
peace at peace on earth and peace and
space then and things fall apart here
then there would be the mission to
Planet Earth to help put it back
together so that&#39;s an active program
because it isn&#39;t known yet how this is
going to play out it&#39;s up to you and me
all of us on planet earth they&#39;re not
going to do it for us no way this is in
the hands of we the people don&#39;t look to
the president or the government or the
UN look to yourselves and your
communities of what you can do to create
universal peace make contact with these
civilizations educate each other and do
not a breakaway civilization but an
advanced new civilization that can
emerge out of the nonsense of the
current culture that&#39;s what we have to
and create all right thank you very much
let&#39;s take about a 15 minute break and
then we&#39;ll come back with some Q&amp;A
