she&#39;s asking about an energy bill being
different from one year to the next
right after using the app I&#39;ve never
heard this before
I guess it&#39;s theoretically possible
we&#39;ve had all kinds of strange things
happen but that&#39;s not a likely event
it&#39;s probably a coincidence
yeah yes sir yeah people have asked
about you know we put out the star
challenge and award a hundred thousand
dollars to someone who can bring a
device that meets certain criteria at
least one kilowatt of continuous power
being put out while itself running no
nobody has surfaced with anything that
meets their criteria and there is still
someone we&#39;re going back and forth with
but there&#39;s been a communication problem
cause the English is not their native
language I&#39;m not sure if the person has
something legitimate or not but the
answer to date is that that still not
been claimed I&#39;d be thrilled if someone
did claim it but I do know that there
have been some breakthroughs with Rossi
with his device and it&#39;s in Italy where
he&#39;s done some excess heat generation
from technology he has and a scientist
friend of mine who&#39;s a scientist knows
someone at the National Security Agency
who had told them they have been
watching
very carefully indicating that it does
have promise now here&#39;s the problem with
what Rossi is doing is that it&#39;s a black
box people don&#39;t know how it&#39;s working
the tests that are being done or by
people who don&#39;t know the mechanism of
action and so there&#39;s been no third
party independent reproduction of the
effect which is our first of all that&#39;s
the sin upon owner of science and
secondly it&#39;s a requirement that we have
so he may in fact have something
legitimate I&#39;m not saying he doesn&#39;t but
strategically it&#39;s almost certainly
going to fail because unless it&#39;s open
source and can be independently
investigated and proven by multiple
third parties and then recreated by
multiple independent third parties it&#39;s
almost certainly never going to get out
of the gate and survive the attempts to
sequester it go sequestration of these
technologies is very easy to do unless
you allow it to go viral and he&#39;s
interested in in monetizing his research
which I understand and normally you
would do that whether it&#39;s an app or a
widget or intermittent windshield wiper
circuit guy became a sense of a
multi-millionaire for invited inventing
that but unfortunately the way the world
actually works is that you cannot
monetize it that way by keeping the
technology secret and if you do it&#39;s
going to disappear at some point and
probably you with it but it&#39;s a very
dangerous game and also one that won&#39;t
impress the scientific community simply
because if people don&#39;t have the ability
to test what it&#39;s doing and
independently confirm it it won&#39;t be
believed because the conventional wisdom
is you cannot get more energy out than
you put in
because the whole zero point equations
have all been tossed out of conventional
physics and mechanical and electrical
engineering
therefore the proof of the pudding is in
the eating
the more you put a black box around your
technology the more likely is it&#39;s gonna
be black shelves at some point or
disappear in the future that was a
problem Stan Meyer had I mean he had a
legitimate technology but he wanted to
patent it but he didn&#39;t want to put the
real information in the patent so he
falsified the hearse the site of the
voltages and and the the cycles per
second of the circuitry in the patent
which of course rendered the patent
useless because it vitiates the patent
&#39;you made a claim in a patent and if you
can&#39;t recreate the device from what&#39;s in
the patent the patent is null and void
so he either had a very bad patent
attorney or he overrode the patent
attorneys advice and did it secretly and
what it means is that everyone who&#39;s
tried to reproduce Stan Meyers
technology from patent have just wasted
their money now I know a couple people
who actually worked with Stan Meyer who
knew what he actually did but the point
is is that those guys those one was his
twin brother who&#39;s scared to death
because he&#39;s convinced Dan Meyer who had
this car running on water was killed and
another one doesn&#39;t want us to forward
for his career being damaged as an
electronics engineer so but you know
when Stan Meyer died for all effective
purposes that technology died with him
so that&#39;s why I tell people it&#39;s not a
wise thing to do if we don&#39;t learn from
history we&#39;re gonna repeat it and the
other corollary to that is the
definition of insanity is to do the same
thing over and over expecting a
different result so there&#39;s a hundred
years of history of these sort of
technologies and there&#39;s a certain
number of ways and the this last that
let a few months ago about six months
ago I did a a seminar on this issue and
went through all the different ways this
has happened and so that&#39;s just the
nature of the beast so we need to we
need to change how we are approaching
all this
