  		              		Experience Description   

    I was 9 years old. We had just moved into a new house. I lived with my mother and my younger brother who was 6 years old. I went to sleep and woke up sometime later in severe respiratory distress with an asthma attack. I went downstairs to find my mother, who was luckily still awake. I was  frantic trying to breathe. I then went grey and collapsed in the kitchen in my mother's arms. My heart stopped beating and I stopped breathing. I went into complete cardiac arrest. 
  
  As we had just moved into a new house, we had no phone connection. This was  before mobile phones and the internet were invented. Luckily my mother had a visiting friend who ran down the street, going from house to house, trying to get someone to ring the ambulance. Because we were new to the area and he was so frantic, it took quite some time before someone would let him in.
  
  Meanwhile, I left my body. I felt so calm and peaceful as I hovered above my body. I could see that my mother was so distressed. Yet, I couldn't understand  why she was so upset because I felt so peaceful. 
  
  I saw the events of my life flash before me in a very calm, peaceful way. I had a sense that I had done my best. There was no judgement.

  There was a spiritual being hovering next to me, who I am tempted to call an angel. They seemed to be there to support  my mother and I.  My mother later told me that she also felt that a spirit was in the room, guiding and supporting her to save my life. The spiritual being guided me towards a tunnel but then stayed behind to support my mother.
  
  My mother had learned CPR 20 years earlier at school but, here, she felt like this presence was guiding her in what to do.  She commenced CPR on me and  continued  for 20 to  30 minutes, until the ambulance  got to the house. 
  
  I felt total peace going through the tunnel. I was greeted by a group of souls on the other side as I said, 'My friends, my friends where have you been?' The message I got back was that they have always been there for me and that they were pleased to see me again. At that point in my life, I had not had anyone close to me die. So, I did not know these souls from this life. It felt like I knew them from a previous life or perhaps a pre-life experience.

  I was then guided towards source/God/supreme being. Source was a beautiful, powerful, all-encompassing love, peace and light. Being near this powerful being was blissful. I felt so much joy and peace. I felt so well. 

  God said to me, 'You know you need to go back don't you?' I replied, 'I don't want to go back'. Then God said to me again, 'You know you need to go back don't you?' I again said, 'I don't want to go back.' Then God said, 'You know you need to go back to help people to heal.' I then felt my spirit being shot back into my body at lightning speed. Perhaps this was a result of the defibrillation at the hospital? It felt traumatic at how sudden this was.

  When the ambulance arrived at the house, they had to administer 2 adult-sized doses of adrenaline to revive my heart. They had no defibrillators in the ambulance at that time, so they had to rush me to hospital to be defibrillated. When I arrived at hospital, I was strapped to a board and  surrounded by 20 doctors and nurses who tried to revive me with the defibrillators.  I was resuscitated. Luckily with no damage to my brain or any ill effects.

  The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning in intensive care and wondering why I was there.

  ****

  I did not remember this experience after waking up in hospital. I only remembered going to bed one and then waking up in intensive care the next morning. I didn't really talk much about the experience. It was, however, totally transformational for me. I developed a strong sense of purpose and constantly found ways to volunteer my time to support and help others. This eventually unfolded into studying psychology, counselling and life coaching. My main goal was always to help others.

  I also became a spiritual seeker and explored Christianity, Baha'i, yoga, Catholicism, interfaith, indigenous and spiritualist faiths. I tried everything but nothing seemed to really fit. While studying for a Masters Training in Creativity Counselling, we did some breathwork. I was 20 years old at the time. During this breathwork session my whole NDE came back to me in vivid detail. I was surprised, overwhelmed and confused. But, I was grateful to have a missing piece of my life come back into place. I have now developed my own sense of spirituality based on my NDE because no structured religion seems to fit for me. I do, however, pray a lot and feel close to the spiritual realm. Since this experience, I have developed an ability to communicate with souls who are passing over, have passed over or are in a coma. I often get messages from these souls to pass onto others. I also have psychic dreams and intuitive premonitions. I am still trying to process this ability and how to use it to help others.

  When I told my mother about the memories of the NDE,  she told me that she had also had a NDE as a baby that she did not remember until she was 30 years old. This experience also transformed her life. I am grateful that I had this support from her and that she believed me without question. 

  I went on to have three other close brushes with death - a shipwreck (18 yrs. old), a fatal train accident (21 yrs. old) and another severe asthma attack (22 yrs. old). However, I did not have another cardiac arrest.

  Fatal train accident - Glenbrook Train Accident 1999 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenbrook_rail_accident:

    I went into the first carriage on the train with a friend. There were no two seats together, so we kept walking through the carriages until we got to the third carriage that had two seats together. This could have saved our lives as the first 6 meters of the first carriage ended up being crushed into 1 meters after it hit the back of another train. 7 people died and 51 people were taken to hospital. As I walked out of the train and onto the tracks, I could see the souls leaving their bodies. I felt the need to stay nearby and support them. I didn't know what to do but I stayed and prayed for them. My friend was a nurse and tried to help the passengers in the front carriage. She came back distressed, telling me that  there was nothing he could do to help. We went to a funeral of a mother and son who died in the incident. I got up to speak at the funeral to pass on our condolences on behalf of the fellow train passengers. I then felt the mother visit me and say, 'Thank you.' 

  Severe Asthma Attack (21 yrs. old):

  I was walking back from college to my car, down a quiet suburban street. Suddenly, I had an asthma attack. I then realized that I was not carrying my inhaler. There was no one around. I became so short of breath that I could not breathe, talk, or walk. I sat down on a house fence and , 'This might be it for me.' Then I felt an angelic being  lift me up and carry me to my car. I felt them in the car next to me as I drove to the pharmacy. There was a car parking spot right in front of the pharmacy, which was unusual. I felt the spirt being walk me into the pharmacy and the pharmacist took one look at me and gave me immediate medication that helped me to breathe enough to get medical support.

  I feel blessed for having had these experiences, as I know that I am supported and protected. I also feel a very strong sense of purpose every day of my life. I am grateful for each extra day I have been given and try to make the most of each day.

I am very loving and compassionate.

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain -   yes and no. It is very clear and vivid and I have found a way to describe it but the feelings were so amazing that is hard to convey.

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I communicate with souls who are passing over, have passed over and are in a coma. I have a neighbor who's grandson was in a coma last year as a result of a motorbike accident. I prayed for him and then felt him say to me, 'Tell my family that I love them and I am sorry. I have lived a good life and  am ready to go. I want the machines turned off. At that time in the hospital the doctors were saying that they should keep him on life support as because he was young there was a chance that he would make a good recovery. They kept the machines on and he unfortunately went into a vegetative state and died 2 months later.  I have psychic dreams. When I was a teenager, I had a dream that I visited a friend's house that I had never been to before. When I went there, I knew where all the rooms were. I had a dream that a friend got married to a man she had just separated from - one year later they got married. There have been others too.

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I didn't remember my NDE until I was in my early 20s. My mother had also had a near death experience as a baby.  I did not know about this until I shared mine with her. She was totally accepting and believed me without question which was wonderful. I have had mixed responses since then some people are more interested than others.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real.      I didn't remember it straight after my experience.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     It is so vivid.  I can so strongly remember the encounters and the wonderful feeling of peace and joy.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Not the profound sense of joy, wellbeing and love but I have had similar connections with sprit beings in follow up brushes with death, such as, fatal train accident and severe asthma attack.  

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         It was a wonderful experience. It is, however, challenging to have such a profound spiritual experience and then try to live a human life again!  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         No
