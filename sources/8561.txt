    What about older children? Do they have the same NDE   content as adults? It is difficult to select the age that separates children   from adults. Eighteen years old is a legal definition of adulthood in many   countries. However, youth between the ages of sixteen and eighteen are able to   drive, often start employed jobs, and frequently begin romantic relationships. I   consider those between sixteen and eighteen years old to be between childhood   and adulthood rather than to be children. With this consideration, I defined   children  to be younger   than sixteen years old and  adults    to be age sixteen and older. Using the same methodology I   used to study the content of NDEs in the very young, the content of the NDEs of   133 children and 478 adults were compared.
        
  The results:         The responses to the thirty-three questions about NDE content were reviewed.   There was only one question that had a statistically different response between   the two groups. This question asked, “Did you see a light?” Children were more   likely to answer “Yes” and less likely to answer “No.” A similarly worded   question asked, “Did you see or feel surrounded by a brilliant light?” Possible   responses included “Light clearly of mystical or otherworldly origin,”   “Unusually bright light,” and “Neither.” I believe this latter question, one of   the NDE Scale questions, better addresses the mystical, unearthly light that   NDErs often encounter. There was no statistical difference between children and   adults in their response to this question.

    The conclusion:        This group of 133 children, age fifteen and below, appears to have NDE content   that is identical to that of adult NDEs. Considering the above discussion, there   does not appear to be any statistical difference between the two groups in the   percentage of occurrence of each NDE element during their NDEs. This is the   largest study ever published that directly compares the content of childhood and   adult NDEs. 1 
  
        I coauthored a book chapter that included a review of   thirty years of scholarly research on childhood NDEs. That chapter was written   before we had the results available from the NDERF study of childhood NDEs.1   From prior published scholarly literature, we could still conclude: 
  
  Over the first three decades of NDE   research, investigators have published findings on several hundred childhood   NDEs. NDEs in children appear to be accurately remembered, even if shared years   later in adulthood. The contents of children’s NDEs appear similar to those of   adults and do not appear to be substantially affected by age. 2
