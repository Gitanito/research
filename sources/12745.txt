  		              		Experience Description   

    I drank too much alcohol at a New Year’s Eve celebration.  My husband took me to the emergency room because I was having difficulty breathing.  During our way to the hospital, I was crying, breathless, and just praying in my mind.  I  almost passed out when we arrived at the hospital.  The nurses and doctors took me inside and started giving me oxygen and medications. They were trying to wake me up.  After few minutes, they put me in a room. My husband was sitting by my bed.  

  I remember feeling that I was falling into a hole.  I opened my eyes and the only thing I saw was darkness.  Then from far away, I saw a circle or colorful tunnel that was coming right to me.  When it got closer, it was a tunnel. The walls were spinning and the inside looked like a colorful tornado with a bright light at the end of the tunnel.  I stepped inside the tunnel and  looked up.  I was looking at the colors, when I started hearing people whispering.  I couldn’t understand what they were saying.  Then,  dark arms started coming out of the walls of the tunnel and they were trying to reached me.  Instantly, I was pulled out of the tunnel as I watched the tunnel retract until I couldn’t see it. 

   I opened my eyes and I saw my husband fast asleep; I woke him up and I said, 'Baby, you fell asleep so fast' because my experience lasted less than two minutes.  He looked at me like I was crazy and he said, 'You have been out for more than an hour.'   I still don’t know what happened that night or how I lost the sense of time.  The only thing I do know is that I remember my experience like it was yesterday.  I believe that I had  a near death experience.

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?
