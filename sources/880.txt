 In October 1899 the journal, which had begun as Suggestions, began to call itself Suggestion.  The advertisement for Suggestions in The Temple, November 1898, says that it contains "the latest discoveries in Suggestive Therapy and [is] devoted to the study of Hypnotism, Magnetism, Telepathy, Teleaesthesia, Mental Culture, Suggestive Education of Children, Dreams, Visions and other natural phenomena."  To all of this it added "choice literary gems by the world's best known Mystics."  In its final transformation, the list became: "Psychic research, Auto-Suggestion, Suggestive Therapeutics, Drugless Healing, Nature Cure, Personal Magnetism, Thought Power, Health, Happiness, Success."  The journal consisted mainly of reports by Dr. Parkyn and his colleagues (of the likes of the ubiquitous George Dutton) on the success of suggestion-therapy, all designed to promote his mail-order courses on "Hypnotism, Suggestive Therapeutics, and all Psychic Phenomena."  The fundamental point was that a "therapeutic suggestion is a suggestion of such a nature, that when conveyed to an individual through one of his senses, it arouses in his mind a chain of thought, which will assist him to overcome unhealthy mental or physical conditions."  To this proposition over time came to be connected the fundamental New Thought idea of the "two minds in man," a conscious, everyday mind and the underlying mind (or spirit) that creates or molds or controls the body (and in some versions, the world) and is subject to control and manipulation by suggestion.  The journal devoted considerable effort to attacks on frauds in spiritualism, especially materializations, but had strong elements of crank, fringe medicine, and included regular articles (by "Astra") on "The Occult World," especially telepathy, but usually expressed its reservations about the consequences of embracing occultism rather than "science."  The journal attempted to position itself as a rational and scientific defender of what was valid in occultism: "It is the aim of the editor to find a basis of fact on which to govern all theories regarding metaphysical and psychical processes, and to account for all occult phenomena on purely scientific lines."  Regular advertisements, especially in the early volumes, for J.F.C. Grumbine and his College of Psychical Sciences, Hiram Erastus Butler, Ernest Loomis, et al., and for the mail-order lessons sold by Parkyn's Chicago School of Psychology.  The journal regularly noted the doings and publications of its contemporaries (Dowie, Weltmer, Wilmans, Prof. Knowles, Sydney A. Flower, et al.) in trying to distinguish itself from their ideas and practices and establish what it was that suggestive therapeutics was.  For a time in the early 1900s the journal touted the stock of Motzorongo, a land-scheme (250 square miles of land) and sugar-refining venture in Mexico, and published regular reports on the scheme's success.  Noted in "List of Advance Thought Publications," The New Cycle, March 1900, 159-60.  On Atkinson, see the note under Advanced Thought Journal. On Parkyn, see the note under Hypnotic Magazine. The journal ended abruptly with the issue for November 1906, when Parkyn announced that he had sold the journal to Henry Clay Hodges of Detroit, who, in the event, continued it as The Stellar Ray.  Parkyn announced his departure "to finance the greatest industrial proposition that has come up in the United States in many years-- the greatest industrial enterprise since the advent of the Bell Telephone Company. In fact, the enterprise within the next few years will surpass that of the Bell Telephone, both in magnitude of operations and profits for the stockholders."  This Eldorado was the Black Sand and Gold Recovery Company that held the rights to the processes of converting sand directly into steel while recovering the gold.  Parkyn had earlier touted the stock in the company to his readers and received "thousands of dollars" from subscribers eager to get in on the ground floor of the investment, but the scheme seems not to have panned out.
