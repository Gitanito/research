 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Spirit of the Age</I>      

      Summary:  From Pat Deveney's journal database:

 The Spirit of the Age.
 Christian Socialism and Reform.
 1849-1850  Weekly.
 New York, NY.  Publisher: Fowler & Wells.  Editor: William Henry Channing (1810-1884).
 Succeeds: Univercoelum and Spiritual Philosopher and the Harbinger (merged to form)
 1/1, July 7, 1849-April 27, 1850.  16pp., 8 x 12.

 While this succeeds the Univercoelum and Spiritual Philosopher, it is a more explicitly political and socialist (Fourierist, with elements from Proudhom) journal, like The Harbinger which was merged with the Univercoelum to form the journal.  The editor addressed his readers as "Brother Socialists," and the prospectus for the journal said that its purpose was "the Peaceful transformation of human societies from isolated to associated interests, from competitive to co-operative industry, from disunity to unity."  It failed to attract the circle of talented spiritualist writers that had contributed to the Univercoelum, though J.K. Ingalls did write for it (on his proposed "mutualist township" and "Man and His Rights") and there are occasional references to spiritualism.  Contributions by Albert Brisbane, Charles A. Dana, and others.   The journal also ran a weekly series of excerpts from the "Bhagvat Geeta" under the heading "Piety of All Ages."
