 This was the  journal of the Institut General des Forces Psychosiques founded by Jean Beziat (1877-1926) to promote "psychose" or "psychosie," belief in the action of the dead on the living, principally in healing.  He was joined in this work by Paul Pillault and Henri Lormier in establishing healing clinics and almost 100 local societies (Les Fraternelles).  The institute favored the teachings of psychics like Dr. H. Baraduc, a former associate of Charcot and a famous occultist, who taught curing by projection of good thoughts.  These teachings brought the condemnation not only of spiritualists like Gabriel Delanne but of philosophers like Rene Guenon.  The journal was resumed after World War I as Le Petit Fraterniste in 1922 and reassumed the old title in 1923.  In 1924 it absorbed Le Bieniste (q.v.), a schismatic branch of the movement, led by Paul Pillault, that had turned increasingly to "determinisme divin" and "Antoinisme."  The journal the journal had strong feminist, pacifist and socialist tendencies.  Noted in Psychische Studien and Voile d'Isis in 1911 and in Mysteria 1913.  NYPL; BNF (256 issues in Gallica).
