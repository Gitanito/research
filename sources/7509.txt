I had a seizure and there was an eight hour time period where I was blacked out. If anybody out there has read 'Dream Catcher' by Stephen King I found out what it felt like to be Jonesey kind of. I was conscious though I saw or heard nothing, I felt at peace with everything. I guess at one point the doctors said my heart rate was at one hundred and eighty. I saw nothing but darkness, but felt total serenity.
