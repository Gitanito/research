as a result of many continuance of
congressman shift he requested that the
General Accounting Office look into and
try to locate documents pertaining to
what happened here in July 1947 as it
related to a crash of some type of
object congressman Schiff did not
stipulate that these people were to find
a alien spacecraft are some type of UFO
not of this earth
he only stipulated find the records that
would answer once and for all what truly
crashed here the General Accounting
Office was to later inform Jack Anderson
which he reflected this in one of his
articles in his column that they too
felt they were getting a runaround from
they named the Air Force but I would
suggest that every agency it was asked
that had any information was in fact
giving the General Accounting Office
runaround in order not to expose
documentation that the Air Force did
have they stipulated that all records
that would provide any solution or
answer to what happened here in Roswell
was in fact destroyed it was a later
ascertained that the documents that were
in question that were destroyed were in
fact destroyed without proper
authorization congressman Schiff then
asked the General Accounting Office that
they should try to ascertain who ordered
those documents destroyed and at what
time frame those documents were
destroyed General Accounting Office then
came back to shift and stated that it
would be very difficult to ascertain the
time frame as it reflected to them that
was 3040 years ago that those records
was destroyed and at this late date it
would be almost impossible to determine
who ordered their destruction however at
the same time the United States Army was
releasing records on UFOs for the last
half a century the Army has been stating
they did not have any records it was
found that the army did have records to
wit Army counterintelligence Corps
records had dealt with UFOs they have
thus far to date released 339 records
there is a record in there and it&#39;s very
interesting and it&#39;s this document and
it is this document right here
stipulates remembering that this is a
document that was released dealing with
UFOs it is part of the
counterintelligence core files
pertaining to UFOs you will note
projects US Air Force detachment 35 US
Air Force detachment 35 was a highly
highly sensitive intelligence unit at
the time this list names of cities here
in the US that had some dealing with
UFOs you can find as a matter of fact
some of these incidences referred to in
the early histories of project sign
which was the forerunner of Project Blue
Book you will note right up here circled
Roswell this is a UFO file R this is
from the UFO files of the
counterintelligence Corps United States
Army you will note the authorization for
the declassification is based on an
order signed into law by President
Clinton to wit executive order 12333
classified yes you will note down below
that it states other agencies interest
Declassified you will note it circled no
clearly this is an army document clearly
this document reflects that these were
projects that were turned over to the
United States Air Force from army files
reason for that prior to September 1947
the AH the Army and the Air Force were
the same we find out that there was a
concern about the existence of these
document are these objects as to what
their purpose was and what their origin
was this came home on February 26 1942
commonly called the Battle of Los
Angeles we find that there are some 15
to 20 unidentified craft flying over Los
Angeles Wow
we immediately respond
haunted by trying to shoot these objects
down the thirty-seventh coastal
artillery group expanded 1430 rounds
without bringing anything down we
immediately set out to try to find out
if there was some hidden base belonging
to the axis from the way these planes
come some commercial airport that they
could have had these aircraft housed
none of this bore out every search
effort we made turn out to be fruitless
at the same time in the Pacific Theater
they were experiencing the same of the
same phenomena the so-called Foo
Fighters MacArthur directed his
intelligence people to find out what was
going on I have reason to believe that
1943 MacArthur
found out that in fact we had things not
of this earth that we had visitors from
some other planet visiting our planet
here that was actually observing that
world event that we call the Second
World War
one of the problems that he had was that
should this be the case and should they
prove to be hostile we knew very little
about them and we had very little means
from which to defend ourselves
MacArthur organized what was called the
interplanetary phenomena unit it would
later be taken over by General Marshall
and it continued all the way through to
present-day names been changed
records still haven&#39;t surfaced the army
tries to state that it was not an
official organization effort to try to
investigate UFOs but it was it was
organized by a general it bore fruit it
came to conclusions that was not popular
ie interplanetary spacecraft and they
continued to do exactly what they do
today and that is to be part of a multi
intelligent operation in the recovery of
objects of unknown origin particularly
those that are of non earthly origin and
to assess that information get raw field
intelligence data and process that data
into some type of useful intelligent
product to disseminate to the field to
those people who have a need to know and
those people that are
our the shall we say the keepers of that
information I believe that there was
something that was discovered in China
in 1943 exactly what that something is I
have no idea what what that was but one
of his Air Force generals Army Air Corps
generals at the time came back to
MacArthur told MacArthur what we have is
something not of it not of this earth I
would further suggest that by this time
even the Germans had uncovered evidence
that we were being visited and had some
type of physical evidence MacArthur
definitely had physical evidence from
the documentation I saw I was not able
to ascertain exactly what that not or
what that physical evidence consisted of
but it was there the one thing I find
quite unique is that the Germans may
have tried to back engineer it we
definitely probably tried to back
engineer it but we find that your
technology has to be on par with the
acquired technology in order to back
engineer we very quickly were able to
ascertain within three to four years
after the end of the war that our
visitors we&#39;re anywhere from one to two
billion years ahead of us in the 1950s
the United States Air Force had an elite
unit to investigate UFOs outside a blue
book even though blue book thought that
that unit was working with them that
they were not this unit was initially
organized as a 4600 second air
Intelligence Service squadron among its
peacetime missions was Operation Blue
flight operation blue fly was to recover
all objects of unknown origin that fell
to earth it&#39;s very important that you
remember objects that fell to earth
because we didn&#39;t have any spacecraft up
there at this time as a result of this
these they had monitors right there at
wright-patterson that when UFO reports
came in they were looked at very closely
to see if there was any possible mean
of our at any possible necessity of
sending out teams to recover any of this
fallen debris the airforce States they
never used them I&#39;m telling you they did
but the intent of project our operation
blue fly peacetime project was to go out
and recover objects of unknown origin
that impacted with the earth later it
would be expanded in 1957 to cover all
objects of unknown are all objects of
unknown origin meaning spacecraft - it
would be expanded to a much larger
program income encompassing other
programs out there and it would become
part of what they would call in the 1919
57 October timeframe project moon dust
project moon dust is the overall field
exploitation to recover only two items
that is objects of non-us origin that
survives reentry into the earth&#39;s
atmosphere and impacts with the earth
naturally we would be interested in
those items from a technical our
scientific intelligence
basis to determine or try to ascertain
the technical capabilities of any
potential enemy our known enemy of the
US at that time that was launching space
vehicles in space the other are the
other area of interest was objects of
unknown origin now we find that there
were quite a few objects of unknown
origin that did not correlate with any
known space law launches our impact
times of any known space debris is
falling back to earth we also find out
that there was never a report filed out
by our government that we had recovered
these objects and then notified the
country we would immediately ascertain
the point of origin that we had
recovered them which would be required
by international law and we never ever
went ahead and had a political protest
filed against us in show
it under moon dust under blue fly we
have recovered alien debris not of this
earth the degree of classification that
we have now has changed over the years
back during the time of the Second World
War all the way up to say 1969 you may
have had as many as 11 classifications
now there are three secret our
confidential secret and top secret
however if you have information that is
highly sensitive that requires the
protection be above and beyond the norm
of what is provided for those
classifications that&#39;s what you have the
special access programs for you do not
get that type of information out into
public domain unless it is officially
sanctioned during the discussion of UFOs
the question ultimately is going to come
up can any government keep secrets let
alone the US government and the answer
that is unequivocally yes but one of the
greatest weapons the intelligence
community has at their disposal is a
predisposition by the American people
the American politicians and I hate to
call them the bunkers but we&#39;ll call
them the bunkers people who wish to try
to debunk UF UFO information they
immediately come out all we can&#39;t keep
secrets we can&#39;t keep secrets well the
whole situation is yes we can the
National Reconnaissance Office remain
secret for many many years the the mere
existence of the NSA remains secret the
development of the atomic weapon remains
secret until once you exploded one you
eventually had to tell some people what
was going on why the Sun appear to be
setting down on planet Earth locations
people&#39;s own perceptions of the universe
the people&#39;s own thoughts as to the
existence of life being out there is one
of their might be life out there and we
may sometime pick up radio
communications
but physics tells us they can&#39;t get here
so we are conditioned by our own
paradigms not to accept the possibility
our probability of an advanced highly
advanced intelligent civilization coming
here to visit us you have evidence in
the form of a highly credible reports of
objects being seen of the entities
inside these objects being seen yet we
look for a pose a explenation and we
throw out the bits and pieces of the
evidence it doesn&#39;t meet our paradigm so
it&#39;s a self keeping secret you can
conceal in plain sight the existence of
the abundance of evidence alluding to
UFOs even bringing that evidence out to
the public it&#39;s political suicide if you
go and start hitting up intelligence
agencies to get this information
released so most of your members of
Congress and I know I&#39;ve worked with a
lot of them along that line we&#39;ll bulk
and try not to do it I can name you uh
three scientists are I&#39;m sorry three
members of Congress that were
point-blank asked to have a
congressional inquiry on what happened
here at Roswell one of the most
ridiculous statements that I got was
that a person would have to be a
chairperson to do that and they asked a
senator from Mississippi if he&#39;d do it
without any hesitation he said no and I
said well excuse me but it&#39;s not the
good senator or referring to a chair
member and they said oh yes
and I said would you give me that in
writing I got that in writing but I&#39;m
hesitant to release it I will show it to
you but I&#39;m hesitant to release it
simply because I made a promise not to
we have got to get the documentation as
it exists in the government files we
have got to get it released before it
ultimately comes up being destroyed as
soon as we open a door and we&#39;re right
there we&#39;re about to bust open the door
good cases the Blue Book
for the blue fly and moondust files I
had classified documents the Air Force
acknowledged when I got kembers of
Congress to help me they were
immediately destroyed I improved this
somewhere along the line they may see
that material and realize there&#39;s some
very highly sensitive information that
would have damning effect upon the
national security of the United States
should it become compromised
it requires I&#39;ll be further protected to
ensure that there is only a limited
access to that information to a small
number of people so small you can put
them on a list paper or on a piece of
paper and list them by name thus you
have the special access programs the
controls that were supposed to be put on
the special access programs are not
there when Congress did their review of
the way we do our eyes of the way we
protect our documents and the way we go
ahead and implement our secrecy programs
they found that you had special access
programs within special access programs
that it was essentially impossible that
keep control of them all and I&#39;m telling
you right now it is essentially
impossible to keep control of them all
when it comes to UFOs the same criteria
applies the problem we have right now is
that that event ie in the ultimate
contact whether it&#39;s no longer question
about the reality of other beings in the
universe coming here that event has not
taken place therefore but a small
nucleus within the intelligence
community numbering less than 100 not
suggest less than 50 control all that
information it is not subject to
congressional review by the the
information security oversight at all
there would be quite a few missions to
describe but simply put yes I was
involved in those type of operations a
lot of people think that you&#39;re just in
the unit waiting in the rafters just
waiting for the next UFO crash are
landing where there&#39;s going to be debris
it doesn&#39;t work that away you have a
real life you have a real job in the
military however if you are in an area
where an event takes place and you are
one of these people that they can go
ahead and call upon in your field of
expertise and I can&#39;t tell you what that
field of expertise of mine would be
because I really don&#39;t know but if
you&#39;re in that location if you&#39;re in
that vicinity you would be one of muta
lights now in order to prepare me for
this very early on my career
they sent me to NBC school at Fort
McClellan Alabama but it&#39;s a three-week
school it&#39;s a four unit NBC personnel
NBC meaning nuclear can nuclear
biological and chemical and it would
always be on the hasta Simmons&#39;s that&#39;s
what I was involved in later on it would
change to be something even more so but
you would go ahead I use it just as
though it was a nuclear accident there
are procedures already established on
nuclear or biological or chemical
accident a hazard material accident and
you would utilize it that way if you
could get in there and do the recoveries
if you could go in and extract the
debris that are there quietly behind the
scenes and no one knows you do it if you
needed an officially sanctioned
deception program to come into play such
as a bogus news release you could do
this also you have an airplane accident
we have standard procedures on how we
handle that those same procedures are
utilized when you do a recovery or
extraction of a crashed spacecraft
Arda breeze thereof and I have to stress
the breeze simply because these are
highly advanced technical machines there
were not that many crashes they&#39;re
flawless because they are made by an
intelligence that is as mortal as you
and I as being mortal we are subject to
error now we&#39;re talking about a highly
intelligence a highly intelligent
civilization
not a highly incompetent civilization we
take steps they take steps but at the
same time when you go out you make a
recovery and when you make that recovery
you handle it the same way you would as
if you were out there getting up on a
airplane accident or you have a
hazardous material type situation
because it works it&#39;s all set up the
only problem you have is that you have
people out there that are very quickly
go and realize that this is not
something of this planet to be sure with
the blue fire blue fly aspect of
recoveries you do what&#39;s called an
on-site analysis in short you have
experts out there who know what missiles
are who know what aircrafts are they&#39;re
looking at this material they&#39;re telling
you what it isn&#39;t this leaves you to
only one possible conclusion something
that did not originate on the face of
this planet that was the intent of the
blue flight teams it was very critical
to do an immediate on-site analysis now
the way you package the material if it&#39;s
just debris is handled the same way you
would if it was hazardous material you
took precautions if you had a whole
craft you took very serious precautions
because while I still state they are not
hostile but you could cause some serious
accidents which would result in death
I&#39;m not going to get into it how it was
with the family when I had to leave
because you get a little emotional
because you think about what could
happen but the whole situation is we
didn&#39;t reinvent the wheel I can show you
the documentation is how our documents
on how we would do this except for the
classified aspects of it but they are as
valid today
they were twenty years ago thirty years
ago we have just made improvements of
course you try to conceal the material
particularly if you have a large craft
and it&#39;s just shaped or say wedge shape
which is a very good shape that we get
from time to time oh and you do this
particularly if you have to go ahead and
put it on a truck to bring here if you
have to bring put it on a truck to take
it to a safe haven area we track that
truck the truck has an 800 number
currently today or if there is a break
down there to secure the vehicle and
stay with it but they have a number they
can call and immediately get assistance
out there to move that vehicle to a safe
haven area and there are procedures
outlined in this as a matter of fact you
have a shipping document and that chip
in document has the number right on it
where you call what you have you have a
cold word there&#39;s a code word I&#39;ll use
one that we used all the time to Basco
let&#39;s say it your code word is Tabasco
well they&#39;re not going to send people
out there that are familiar with
aircraft that are familiar with specific
types of chemical are people who are
real experts in nuclear waste or things
of this sort you&#39;re going to get a
specialized team out there that knows
what to do should there be a biological
and one of the big concerns we had was
biological they do to our contamination
as we thought of this being truly of
alien origin I am prepared to state that
I have been at locations where craft of
unknown origin that did not originate on
the face of this planet was there I am
prepared to state that while I was there
we saw living dead bodies of entities
did that were not born on this planet I
am prepared to state that we had what we
what they referred to as interfacing
with those entities I am prepared to
state that the situation is they have a
school to try to indoctrinate people I
never went to that school I always
refused I am
paired to state that when I got out of
the service in 1999 1990 that they held
me for two months that I might better
reconsider to stay in and not get out I
am prepared to state that I had orders
that stated that I was supposed to get
out November 1st our November 1st
December 1st I think it was December 1st
of 1989 that they revoked those orders
once again in violation of law to hold
me for two months pending approval of my
retirement which had already been
approved the purpose of that was try to
convince me to stay in we have contact
with aliens not originating from some
foreign country but from some other
solar system and I have been a party to
that I&#39;ve worked it I&#39;ve been there and
I know some of the things we do is
really really really really terrible
they are not hostile toward us we&#39;re the
enemy in this instance but we&#39;re the
enemy I like to think for the good
reasons we&#39;re concerned about what some
other country might do I have concluded
that I&#39;m fighting against the clock that
I have but a short time to try to
convince people that we are moving in an
Avenue where we are going to military
space once we militarized space we will
have a whole new avenue of Technology
open up to us while NASA says it&#39;s going
to take another 1,400 years before we
achieve what we call interstellar travel
I&#39;m telling you by the end of this
century we will be doing that we want to
acquire this technology we want to make
this technology part of our own
technology within the next 25 years
we&#39;re going to militarize space as a
result of militarizing space we are
going to acquire new technology we&#39;re
going to evolve new technology that&#39;s
going to lead us in the interstellar
travel as a direct result we will become
a threat
to them unless we spiritually grow also
but I feel that if we do not if we do
not go ahead and spiritually grow we are
forcing the situation where the entities
will eventually make themselves known
and they will make themselves known and
no power on earth can stop that from
happening in order to avoid us from
going out into space that if this should
happen it will happen to an unsuspecting
world population and that can create
some very serious problems but this
doesn&#39;t deal just with the United States
it&#39;s a truth that the entire world has
to be informed about and that truth is
man is not alone that we have people
from other planets from other solar
systems coming here I believe that the
intelligence community we had good
intentions when they classified
information dealing with UFOs I believe
that they asked some very serious and
hard questions what impact would it have
if the peoples of the world knew that
they were no longer alone in the
universe that they had intelligence that
was visiting this planet and I think
that the intentions were good there as
intelligence agencies among nations
naturally you want to go ahead and
acquire the technology for military
application so you want to try to keep
some of that aspect as confidential as
possible by classifying it as high as
you possibly can keeping it to keeping
the information open to but a small
handful of people the special access
programs however I believe that while
was full of good intentions in keeping
this information classified it is
hurting people I do not believe that any
government has the right to try to make
individuals who merely see UFOs look
crazy when we know the truth I do not
believe that any government has a right
knowing that the psyche of the
psychology of specific individuals may
ultimately lead
to them having their homes broke up
their jobs are lost
leading to a tremendous amount of mental
depression ultimately leading in many
many cases to suicide or
self-destruction when we see these types
of things coming about we have an
obligation to reconsider our thoughts
and standpoint reconsidering those I
would suggest we need to break down the
walls of secrecy that we must be
responsible in getting the truth out we
must be responsible on how we get that
truth out and we must be truthful and
it&#39;s not a scary story you will learn
that there they have a perception of God
they can&#39;t tell you what religions right
you find they have families you finally
have cultures you find that they have
likes and dislikes you find that you
look for those things that are similar
among us not the difference and that&#39;s
the way you start on the path to truth
the problem that we have right now is
that we look at them as something to
talk about something to be marvel at and
be amazed at but here again they are
still considered with in the recesses of
our mind of something that&#39;s not
practical and something that isn&#39;t real
well we just finished with the training
that I took up to be an NBC and CEO and
a friend of mine which I&#39;ll calling Jack
and Jack was his first name he is a spec
five he brought me back to Fort Lee
Virginia somehow someway my ticket my
billfold everything came up missing I
got my billfold with the money back and
yet but I never did get the ticket back
but not having a way to get back to Fort
Lee Virginia he was going to Fort Meade
Maryland he says come on I&#39;ll take you
and we discussed UFOs on the way to Fort
Lee several weeks after I got back to
Fort Lee I got a call from Jack or
allegedly it being Jack and I believed
it to be Jack because he was a cheerful
happy-go-lucky person
and this person sounded the same way
however when I got to Fort Meade where
he was supposed to be at they said while
he&#39;s going to be tied up we&#39;ll talk to
you later about his situation as soon as
he gets free says by the way have you
ever been to uh the Pentagon well at
that time I&#39;d never been to the Pentagon
so they said well it&#39;s really a unique
places why don&#39;t we go ahead and give
you the 25 cent tour so we went on over
we went in I had a little badge it was
given to me no picture on it but the guy
that was with me had a picture and he&#39;d
just tell the guards he&#39;s authorized to
come with being and he&#39;d always be the
one to get me in you had to show your
military ID card from time to time but
we walked down the quarters finally we
got to a place that has an elevator we
went down I don&#39;t know how far down we
win I can&#39;t tell you if there&#39;s one uh
one flight under the Pentagon two or 50
but we went down when we went down to I
don&#39;t know several seconds and in the
elevator we get out when we get out
there&#39;s just like the white walls and
it&#39;s like an inverted D like a flat
bottom with a curved top
now there&#39;s two mana rails there I mean
there are rails they look like big tubes
rather thick in the center and two on
the side I mean one on each side
I could probably draw you a better
picture Evan William describing it but
you had these little uh monorail while I
but I call them cars that look like a
bullet I mean for lack of a better term
you could today you had a UH
where you could see two people in front
two people and back we got on the one
monorail and started to go it seemed
like maybe twenty minutes but I&#39;m
guessing at that because I don&#39;t know
for sure when we got out he says well
let me show you some interesting sights
down this corridor here so we&#39;re going
down the corridor and it looked like
there was a door at the far end of that
corridor as we got closer and closer to
that door my guide turned to me and
stated you know things aren&#39;t always as
they seem too
he says like a lot of people don&#39;t know
about these underground locations
underneath the Pentagon if you know that
the Pentagon has underground mana rails
that connect up to other locations he
says it&#39;s just like you know the walls
here they don&#39;t all seem like walls
that&#39;s what what do you mean they don&#39;t
they&#39;re not walls what are you talking
about I thought I thought you were
always trying to make a joke Oh
at that time he says noise just like the
wall behind ya look it looks like a wall
to me there&#39;s no seams nothing I can see
then he pushes me I try to grab myself
and you don&#39;t just go through it there&#39;s
actually a door there that open you want
me to finish this too don&#39;t you yeah
well when you go through the door
there&#39;s like a filled table there and
behind the filled table you had this
little entity the entity was a little
bigger than the three three and a half
foot tall entities that a lot of times
reported but there were two men on
either side of the table slightly behind
the creature but yet I got up and I was
asking him why he was acting foolish and
things of this sort what go in how we
were hitting up on that but when I
turned around I looked right into the
eyes of this little creature and you
know it&#39;s like oh you&#39;re seeing it but
everything&#39;s being pulled from your mind
pains you felt you feel that and it&#39;s
like a buzz saw going off on your head
oh he was reading my whole life
and I mean you know it&#39;s hard to
describe what what you really felt there
odd
your life up to that point in seconds
and I mean you were filling everything I
went ahead
I remember going down and grabbing ahold
of my head like this and falling to the
floor next thing I remember I wake up
I&#39;m back in Jack&#39;s office and well I&#39;m
in back in Jack&#39;s office they told me
nothing happened that I&#39;d been there the
whole day but I knew better there is an
interaction between entities and certain
government agencies within the US
government
I will not go so far to state that they
are giving us technologies to kill
ourselves they are not along that line
their purposes of being here are for
scientific purposes and for humanitarian
purposes abductions those abductions
which I believed to be real have nothing
to do with the scary scenario abductions
that people hit up with there&#39;s a reason
for it we have been very foolish in how
we have done certain things and we have
harmed ourselves we now realize that we
have harmed ourselves and we are trying
to take corrective action and that right
there is the one thing that they&#39;re
checking on there has been the vial
sphere that&#39;s been damaged they&#39;re not
coming here to repair that they are
coming here to seeing how we handle it
but a government can&#39;t be the lawn that
childers all the responsibility and show
of shoulders all the knowledge and all
the understanding the whole situation is
is that we have to work in unison as a
people a united people let&#39;s go ahead
and start preparing ourselves to where
we ultimately will take that giant step
to where we&#39;re going to be visiting
other planets out there in other solar
systems and we have to once again I&#39;ll
use the word grow spiritually as a
group of people the people representing
mankind on planet Earth
yes there is some type and I don&#39;t know
to what extent but there is some type of
dialogue that is taking place between
our visitors of all species because
there&#39;s more than one and the various
governments of not just the US
government but of the world&#39;s primarily
the fully developed are the how do I put
this the more developed nations of the
world because at present spacefaring
nations represent the greatest threat to
them as a peaceable coexistence so I
went ahead took the little snack lunch
that I had with me took it upstairs we
were looking down we were seeing the
briefing room and had like a plexiglass
it separated the balcony and what was
going on downstairs and you couldn&#39;t
hear what was being said but we started
noticed that they were running the film
and the film showed various types of
what we would call UFOs today and showed
various types of alien creatures ie your
greys uh some covered with a whole lot
of hair some that looked very much like
us some that looked like us with marked
differences we were not aware of the
fact that there were people now up there
with us and they told us you know do you
guys what are you guys doing up here and
we told them well you know we&#39;re just
setting up here uh eating our snacks
because we didn&#39;t wanna go the dining
are we do not want to go to the snack
bar they went ahead said you need to
come with us you need to come with us
now so I mean they pushed us grabbing us
by the nape of the neck of the shirt and
pushed us down the stairs once they got
down to the stairs they pushed us on out
the doors will push both of us into a
van the van was right there waiting
panel van where they pushed us in and
shut the door and then they drove us off
we don&#39;t know where they took us to
but the location where we finally got
out was a one frame a military-style
building they took us in there put us
into this room the room had like the
military cots there had one table with a
light there and we were setting back
trying to figure out what why are they
doing this what why is this going on so
on the fifth night I got out ah when I
left the fifth night they drove me back
to my billets I went to N reported in
went to bed because I was dead tired all
I want to do is get some sleep next
morning which was a Saturday morning I
am awakened by the CQ that&#39;s charger
quarters and he says First Sergeant once
see one guy was acting like a good guy
the other guy went ahead and says I told
you we shouldn&#39;t trust him let&#39;s just
take the soul and so out let&#39;s just in
this last shooting and one guy no no no
we&#39;ll discuss this and he sent the guy
that was supposed to be the bad guy we
use that sometimes insecurities good cop
bad cop but the one that&#39;s supposed to
be the bad guy he went to get some food
we had coffee the guy it stayed there
that was acting like a good guy
and myself and he says listen he says
you like working with this stuff and I
don&#39;t know I don&#39;t and he says well you
know you have experience in it you&#39;ve
had some involvement he says and those
were not phony pictures up there they
were not trailers says would you like to
work with it would you like to work with
us no I wouldn&#39;t like that at all
eventually he goes head and says look
you like working with it you&#39;ll get to
work with it you&#39;ll get to learn more
about it says but the whole situation is
by the end of this year we&#39;re going to
release everything we know but here
again the world is not a safe place we
have to know more from a technological
viewpoint in a military standpoint than
potential enemies of this country so I&#39;m
asking you work with us well I thought
about it you know I was young I thought
the
something that I&#39;ve actually been
involved with all my life that&#39;d be fun
that I could go ahead I&#39;ll learn certain
things answers to the questions I had
actually get a better understanding of
events in my life I do believe that one
they want me in the military too they
want me involved in this program three
they wasn&#39;t really concerned about if at
some later date I started to talk about
it
they were only concerned what I might
have to prove if I had some little
slivers of proof what impact would that
have on my story and that&#39;s the
speculation I have on it I know they did
not want me out I know they want me to
stay here I know they want me to go
ahead and go to what they referred to as
the school but I never ever I would
permit myself to go to what they were
referring to his school if you go to
school it will open up a whole new world
for you a whole new avenue but I had to
agree to it and I had to go ahead and
sign specific papers to go to it and I
was not prepared to go to that school I
had seen people who were involved with
the program that had gone to that school
and let me just say I didn&#39;t like their
personality I did not like the idea that
by you going there it made you something
special it made you prima donna if you
wish oh that was not the way it was
supposed to be I felt that one of the
greatest things you can be as a servant
and not vice versa so some of these
people I did not like their disposition
I did not like their attitudes and I did
not want to become like them and one of
my fears was if I went to the school if
that would change me the same way so
it&#39;s important that people understand
that now there are events there are
recoveries but the recoveries are few
and far between one of the events that
took place in 1969 was a recovery of a
craft that I
I call it a wedge-shaped craft that took
place in Indian town gap now I know it
was cold therefore I believe it to have
been in the winter there was no snow we
were on a field training exercise the 96
civil affairs group I was part of the
96th Civil Affairs Company I was the NBC
NBC comma which is communications in
receiving nuclear biological chemical
unit in NCOIC which is noncommissioned
officer in charge we were notified that
they had an incident involving a downed
craft that we needed to assist in
recovering the persons that showed up
knew exactly where we were going because
when we went to our staging area pulling
out of the cut the company exercise our
should I say that the group exercise we
went to what we call a staging area from
there we went to another location on on
Indian town gap we didn&#39;t have any
problems about civilians our curiosity
secrets or anything like this ah other
than to go into a whole lot of detail
about that particular craft there is a
tape out there that does go into detail
on it the situation is we did the
recovery as far as being fully involved
in the recovery outside of going up and
getting surface readings realizing that
what I was seeing was not of human
origin I was limited my involvement when
we got there there was already team
setup floodlights were already set up
around the object I was asked to get
closer and closer to the object to take
readings with the apd 27 as I did this I
realized what I was seeing was not of a
earthly origin ah I&#39;m hesitant to go
into it too much because I don&#39;t want to
get emotional about it
Bentwaters is another very interesting
case with Bentwaters
we went there to digest some of the
information as far as the physical
evidence there there were photographs
there were there was film footage there
was evidence of high background ready
are higher than normal
eh not all that high but above normal
we found that there was some
abnormalities in the area of which we
referred to the MPA impact point we also
notice that the trees had been leveled
off at the top when we got there
it was December I want to say December
28th was the day that we arrived there
we gathered up the materials we took
these materials back to NZ Air Force
Base all the for lack of a better term
all the hard evidence that we could get
all the all the documentation was there
there was even some photographs which I
don&#39;t think has been alluded to as far
as sightings that was picked up on radar
both the British government and the US
government were aware of these sightings
the hard evidence that we had was taken
back to Lindsey Air Force Base there was
digested to where there was some type of
information that could be put out to
brief shape headquarters and I don&#39;t
know who in shape headquarters was
briefed but I did I do know that we did
have to do that the information was then
put with a special courier and we were
told as being sent back to Washington
meaning Washington DC I don&#39;t believe
this to be the case I believe it was
coming back to an airbase close to the
Washington DC area and that the material
is transferred on to Fort Belvoir
Virginia headquarters at the time of the
u.s. air force&#39;s special field
activities group our Air Force&#39;s field
activity center they then took this
material did whatever they did with it
and came up with finalized intelligence
product the important thing to remember
the reason it went to Lindsey was
because the US Air Force&#39;s field
activity center had detachments in the
field
the closest detachment in the field at
the location of Bentwaters would have
been Lindsey Air Force Base which is det
24 they were the ones that got the
material they were the ones that was
charge was safeguarding it until it got
back to the US also there were several
members of debt 24 that was involved in
the investigation there were other
people who came in who we didn&#39;t I
didn&#39;t know who they were but you knew
they were involved in the investigation
because they were doing the things that
would be necessary to do just that they
were asking questions hard questions
critical questions they were asking
technical questions of technical people
was involved I&#39;m I know for a fact that
some of the radar operators both British
and US were questioned I know some of
the people were out there on two
different nights or questioned my
involvement became in June July of 1989
I was involved with the belgium
sightings that we were assessing
information gathering data on the UFO
overflights of belgium they also went
over your are over Germany we had one
incident there on the border which this
one occurred near the photograph the
incident there at the border we saw the
object it was over Soviet territory we
saw that the Soviets were pretty upset
we were getting pretty upset because
this was a huge huge object you would it
was triangular shape about three
football fields on either side of the
triangle it flew over what we call no
man zone as it flew over there
we all were getting jittery uh it wasn&#39;t
winter it was us I&#39;d say some are about
August you could feel your hair standing
up on the end it was more than just you
know getting shivers because of fright
or something like this there was some
type of physiological effect taking
place once this incident sub sighted we
put fighters on alert we notified them
that we may have a cell via craft coming
across the gap and we were going to
intercept it the Soviets did the same
thing it went back over the Soviet
airspace and they scrambled fighters to
try to intercept it wasn&#39;t traveling
fast at all traveling very slow no no
hurry to get out of the area but on this
particular
no one fired at it there were pictures
taken there was consultation with the
Soviet Union with this going on
everyone&#39;s taken in and Bree briefed and
was informed what they saw was nothing
more than a Cuban Makar I&#39;m sorry a
Russian mig-27 that had straight across
into the photo gap area far enough into
the no man zone to create a problem and
cause some alarm it was no mig-27 we
know exactly what we were looking at we
knew mig-27 mig-27 looks like you have
flashcards which are silhouettes of the
various crafts of the Soviet Union and
even our own so we knew precisely what
we were looking at what we saw was a
craft that was of an unusual origin it
was not aerodynamically sound and why
state it was not aerial dynamically
sound I mean it had no means of staying
aloft like that without some visible
means of aerial support lot like a
helicopter that wasn&#39;t there it was
perfectly silent not making any noise
roughly three stories high this was one
of the incidents that got me a little
concerned made me think about wanting to
get out and come back to the family they
have a some family life we add the
incident escalate we had it escalate
toward the Soviet Union filed an
official protest through the Belgium
government to the US government stating
that uh they were very concerned about
the Belgium authorities along with
several other countries letting us fly
stealth aircraft on reconnaissance
missions into the Soviet Union we
notified and discussed it with Sela with
the Soviet Union we briefed at least to
smell Soviet military leis on mission
groups that this had nothing to do with
our involvement of sending stealth
aircraft into their territory
the Soviet Union was alarmed about what
was going on they even alluded to it
being our craft
they were reassured that it wasn&#39;t we
reassured the Belgium authorities that
it wasn&#39;t the Belgium authorities had
their own UFO sightings we have seen
this on TV what you don&#39;t know about
those sightings is it that there was a
tremendous I don&#39;t call it a cover-up
there was a there was a movement to keep
specific information about those
sightings under wraps there was some
intentions to go ahead and alter the
film footage of the radar screens to it
to the point of where it showed that the
UFO went underground which it did not I
think it was supposed to have gone 600
feet into the earth that did not happen
it was it was visible people saw it
the pilots saw it the pilot saw aircraft
locked on to it but these were things
that would create more questions than
there were then we were willing to
answer so we decided to keep this out of
the press and we were successful at it
the Iranian incident of September 19
1976 the situation with that there are
highly classified documents dealing with
what we found both fighters were taken
apart to try to find out if there were
any changes if there was any way we
could explain what really happened to
those fighters with having them having
the malfunctions at the same time there
was a situation where we had uh some
anomalies picked up out where the
sighting was where they were the f1 of
the f4 saw the UFO go down to the ground
we recorded those anomalies with audio
devices
we took film footage of the area and
there were some strange things that
showed up on that on that film footage
what all took place there at the landing
area I am not privy if I don&#39;t have all
the information it wasn&#39;t something I
had to be involved in but I can tell you
this much whatever took place there had
people out there for two to three weeks
in 1986 I believe it was fired at a UFO
on two occasions the UFO took off like
nothing happened in 1980 1980 I believe
it was you had the incident where you
had oh no this was in 86 in 86 you had
the incident where you had 20 or more
UFOs flying around Brazilian aircraft
flying rings around them these documents
are important they&#39;re documented events
by government document documentation how
many there have been over all since 47
no not more than two dozen
ah that&#39;s domestic or well that that
right there was uh a round figure but
it&#39;s based on a briefing we got and this
briefing came as a part this was in 1969
when we were hitting up on information
dealing with the recovery of the b-52
there we were informed that there had
only been a couple dozen tops that there
were several in the 40s in the early 50s
and once again to make it perfectly
clear about those events that took place
there there and I mean it sounds crazy
but there&#39;s is there there guidance
system our radar wrapped a buckle and
they had to make adjustments to their
guidance systems for that how many
bodies have been recovered don&#39;t know
how many crashes have occurred in which
we only got the breeze from because they
came and did their recovery before we
got there
don&#39;t know but it has
it has happened when they have problems
just like we send out a distress call
they send out a distress call which is
something that a lot of people don&#39;t
allude to or don&#39;t even it&#39;s the one
question that&#39;s never asked but here
again we think of them as something
intangible like that stuffed animal
there but they&#39;re living breathing
creatures as mortal as you and I they
think they have loves they have likes
they have dislikes they have social
culture this is so it&#39;s so important to
try to make people understand that that
is the case I want to put the human
factor back in the UFOs and when I say
the human factor that these are real
people you can call them entities and
call them creatures only reason I do
that without saying these are real
people is so it doesn&#39;t get confusing as
to what I&#39;m talking about
our visitors are us but you sometimes
find yourself wondering who&#39;s the more
real people them or us and the situation
is oh these are the things that that
really need to be brought out also the
fact that they are in fact uh just like
you and me we need to seek out the
similarities not the differences and
come to a greater understanding because
eventually and the not-too-distant
future we&#39;re going to have that final
contact that&#39;s going to open new doors a
lot of people set back and say well they
don&#39;t have basis here how they do do you
have specific information about their
basis here we were involved in a major
engagement in 1970 in one of their bases
at a place called Dewey Bhatia and where
is that in Vietnam Tay Ninh Province
approximately seven
from the Cambodian border oh if you want
to know more about that i didäôt an
audiotape on that and i&#39;ll make you a
copy of the audio the audio tape um I
will apologize for actually trying to
hold back from some of the stories
simply because if I start talking about
some of the stories you start reliving
them and you don&#39;t understand I mean you
really don&#39;t understand
the same thing with the actual craft no
seatbelts you don&#39;t need seatbelt
because when you fly one of these things
upside down there&#39;s no upside down like
in a regular aircraft
you have your own gravitational field
right inside so if you&#39;re flying upside
down to you your right side up
