PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE.
AT an early period of the French Revolution;
~here appeared a rea. calling itfelf Jacobin, and
~caching that all mm wtre ·equal and free ! In th~
name of their equaiity and diforganizing liberty,
they trampled under (oot the a:ltar and the throne ;
they ftimuiated all nations to rebellion, and aimed
at plunging .them ultimately into the .horrors of
anarchy. .
At its nrft appearance, this feet counted
JOO~ooo _adepts ; and it was fupported by two mii-
lions of men, tcattered through France, armed
with torches and pikes, .and all the fire-brands of
revolution. . .
It was under the aufpices o( this fed:, by their
intrigues, their influence, and their impulfe, that
France beheld itfeif a prey to every crime; tha&-
its foil was ftained with .the blood of its pontiffs ·
and priefts; of its rich men and nobles ; .with the
blood ofevery clats ~t-its citizens, without regard
to rank, age or· f~x .! Thefe,were ~e m~n who,

the French Revolution a fcourge to all Europe,
. a terror to its Powers, who vainly combine to
ftop the progrefs of their revolutionary armies,
more numerous and deftrucHve than the inunda-

~folved on, was combined· and premeditated :

appeared three men leagued in the moft
inveterate hatred againft Chriftianity. Thefe were Chiefs of
Voltaire, D'Alembert, and Frederick II. King of~ con-
. . •paacy.
Pruffia. Voltaire hated religion becaufe he was
jealous of its Author, and ofall thofe whom it had
rendered illuftrious; D'Alembert .be~aufe his cold
heart was incapable of affeCtion J Fredc:rick be·
cau(e he had never feen it but through the mtdium
of its enemies.
To thefe three a fourth muft be added, named
Diderot ; hating religion becaufe he doated on
nature; . ¢hthufiaftically wedded to the chaos of
his own ideas~ he chofe rather to build his fyftem
ori chimeras and form myfteries of his own,·than
fubmit to the light of the Gofpel.

Numerous were the adepts afterwards drawn
into this confpiracy, generally ftupid admirers or
fecondary agents. Voltaire the chief, D'Alembert
the moft fubtle agent, Frederick the proteC\:or
and often the advifer,- ·Diderot the forlorn hope.
VoltaireJ ·The firft of thefe confpirators, Mary Francis
' Arouet, was born at Paris, February !loth, 1694~
{on of an ancient notary of the Chatelet ; through
vanity he changed his name to that of Voltaire,
which he deemed more noble, more fonorous,
and better fuited to th~ reputation he aimed at :
and never had there yet appeared a man with
fuch talents, arid fuch a thirft of dominion over
the·]iterary world. Gravity Q{ manners~ the 'fpirit
of meditation, or a genius leading to difcuffion
and deep refearch, were unfortunately not among
the gifts which Nature had ·Javifhed on him ; and
more unfortunately ftill, in his own heart were
to be found all thofe paffions which render abilities
dangerous : from his early youth he· feemed to
direC\: them all at the overthrow of religion.
While only a ftudent in rhetoric, in the college of
Louis le Grand, he drew on himfelf the following
II rebuke from his profelfor, .the Jefuit LeJay, Un~'

On leaving the college~ he neither fought nor '
loved any other fociety, but that ofmen whofe pro-
fligate lllOrals could ftimulate his incredulity. He
was 'particularly intimate with Chaulieu the Ana•
creon of his day, the poet of VQluptuoufnefs; and
with a few Epicureans who held their fittings at the ·
Hotel de 'Vendome. His firft dfays were in
fa.tire, .which gave offence to governmen~, and in
tragedy, where we thould have · feen the rival of
Coroeille, Racine and Crebillon, had he not at
the f.lme time wifhed to rival Celfus and Porphy-· .·
•
rius, with all the ocher enemies of religion. . At ·
a time when licentioufhefs in opinion ftill mec !
' with obftacles in France, he fought an afylum \n :•.
E11gland. He there found men whom the writings
of Shafi:efhUry, ~ommented on by Bolingbroke, .
had tra~n-~4·.~.e.-.~o peifm. He..miftook them for X
philofophers, and was })erfuaded that they alone 1 ·
were efteemed by the Englifh. If he was not
then miftaken, times fmce are greatly changed.
Ail thofe fophifters whom Voltaire extols as the
glory of Great Britain, if not forgotten, are more
· defpifed than read. C:~llins_ and Hobbes when
remembered are clatred with Tom Paine; an
Englithman's good fenfe does not allow him to
hate religion, or make an oftentatious difplay of
impiety. With him nothing is lefs philofophical,

" me, an anfwer to moft metaphyfical queftions,
" and the confequent reflection muftbe, that fince
" we know nothing of the matter, it is doubdefs
'I .
Xi:" unneceffary that we lhould know more*."
·· This refleCtion on the little importance of thefe
queftions, was added, left Voltaire, harraffed out
·with the anguifh of his mind; fhould forfake a .
philof~phy unable to folve his doubts on quef-
tions, by no means, .in his opinion, indifferent to
the happinefs of m~n. He infifted, but D'Alem-
bert perfifting in the fame ftyle, fays that " No,
" in metaphyfics, appeared to him not much wifer
" than yes; and that non liquet (it is not clear) was
cc generally the only rational anfwer t."
Frederick was as averfe to doubts as·Voltaire,
but perpetu~ly wifhing to ftifle them, he was
at length perfuaded he had fucceeded. . " A phi·
" lofopher of my acquaintance," fays he, " a man
cc pretty refolute in his opinions, thinks that we
cc have a fufficientdegree of probability, to con-
" ftitute a certainty that po}J mortem nibil ejJ (or
cc that death is an eternal fieep), he' maintains that

" that there exifts no relation between animals and
" 'the fupreme intelligence •."
· 'This refolute philofopher, this ftrange man, was
Frederick himfelf, and a fewyears after, he makes
no fecret of it, when he more decidely writes,
~' I am well affured that I am not twofold;
" hence, I confider myfelf· .as a fingle being..
" I know that I am an animal organifed and that
" thinks; hence, I conclude that matter can
" think,. as well as it has the property of being
" electric t ."
Verging towards his grave, but wifhing to in-
fpire Voltaire with confidence, he writes anew.
" The.gout has fucceffively ran over all my body.
" Our frail machine ~uft needs be deftroyed by
" time, whiCh confumes every thing; my founda-
" tions are undermined, but all that, gives me
" very'little concern t·"
As to the fourth hero of the confpiracy, the
famous Dide~ot, he is exactly the perfon, whofe
decifions againft God, D'Alembert had found too
refolute and dogmatic, though oftentimes, in the
fame work, we find him after deciding ag:tinft the
De~, deciding in the fame peremptory manner
for or ·againft the Sceptic and the Atheift. But
whether he writes for or againft a God, he always
appears impervious.to doubts or anguifh of mind.

written by Voltaire to D'Alemb~rt, the 30th of
January 1764: " My illuftrious phi-lofopher has.

is any difference between the fophifms of the

the fchool of ·Voltaire and .the maxims of the

The Jacobins will one day declare that all men

Left any one fhould doubt of the particular
drift of this compilation ; the reader muft be in-
formed of the co-operators chofen by D'Alembert
and Diderot, and that efpecially· for the re-
-ligious part. Their 'firft divine 'was li!xnal, a
man juft expelled fr-o_~!!. the order of th~ Jefuits on
account of his impiety, his chief ahd ftrongeft re-
commendation to D'Alembert. Every one un-
fortunately knows how much he verified the judge•
ment of his former brethren, by his atrocious de-
clamations againft Chrijtianity ; but few are ac-
quainted with the anecdote of hi~ expulfior:t from
~ll)~~g the co-~-~~' and that connetts his ftory
. with that of another divine, vrho, without being
impious himfelf, had been unfortunately,drawn into
the company of the Sophifters.
This was the Abbe Y von,.an odd metaphyfician,
but an inoffenfive and up;'ight man; often in ex-
treme indigence, and living by his pen, when he
thought he could do it with decency. In the fim-
plicity of his heart he had written CJ'be DifeliCe of
the Ailbe de Prades. I have heard him a1fert that
not a fmgle error could be found in that work,
an.d on the firftargument give up the point. With
the fame fimplicity I have heard him relate, by

J' nal, who had received a.thoufand crowns for .his .

This anecdote .will not furprife thofe who are
acquaipted with Raynal's plagiary talents. His
impiety was not fufficient to prefent his difr:uif-
·fion, ·but it preferved him within.the pale of the
fraternal embr~ce.
I muft add, that the articles on Goo and on the
1 SouL, furnilhed by the Abbe Yvon, are ~xa&ly
thofe which grieved Vol~aire to the heart, .and for
which, D'Alembert and'Diderot were obliged to
have -recourfe to their.art of refer~nces. ·

that the Atheifts conclude, that the exillence of God is un-:-

the reader turn to the articles of EN c Y c LoP B o 1 A an4

The fa:me cunning is to be found in the article of the On the

As to Frederick, during the whole of this Avowal
warfare, his conduct is fo fingular, that his words ~~:nge
alone can give a proper idea of it. He would conduCt
·call the Jefuits, Z'be life-guards offbe court ofRome, ~:~::rede­
the grenadiers ofReligion; and as fuch hated them,
and triumphed with the reft of the confpirators in
their defeat. But he alfo beheld in them a body
ofmen ufeful and e.ven necdfary to his ftate; as fuch
he fupport.ed them feveral years after their deftruc-
tion; was deaf to the repeated folicitations ofVol-
taire and his motley crew. One could be ~lmoft
tempted to think he liked them ; he openly writes
·to Voltaire, " 1 have ·no reafon to complain of
" Ganganelli, he has left me J;Dy dear Jefuits,·
" who are the objeCts of univerfal perfecution.
" I will preferve a feed of fo precious and un-

" there was no alternative, the deftruttion of

.Gtion to the Sophifters. Alas! I have already faid

not only among .the BenediCtines, who have been
more generally excepted from this badge of igno-
raqce, but among all other orders that I have met
with men, as diftinguifhed by their knowledge, as
by the purity c;>f their morals. Could I, alas, ex-
tend this remark to the laiety ! This, indeed, is a
language very different from that, which the rea-

reach of calumny or of a Briennes, a-pretence

With a view to diminifh the number of real
. '
nuns, he thought, that if he augmented thofe
afylums for cariondfes, who have a much greater

eafily perverted, that novices would not be fo nu-

meant.to render the real nuns odious to the nobi-

foundations to particular ranks, which had ever
been common to all.
Thefe were refleCtions that Briennes little attend-

th~i~ all Eut•pe has been overrun with moft impious

The method to be obferved in their own works,
was particularly concened between Voltairc:,
D'Alembert and Frederick. We fee them, in

admirable. The following example will convince
·the hiftorian, or the reader, ofthe gre~t art of this
crafty Sophifter.
It is well known, ·with what immenfe pains om: Cunning

into mines, fplitting mountains or digging up their

refearches, to hear them talk, had no other en4
qut the advancement of fcience and natural philo.
fophy. Their new epochs were not to affea re-
ligion, and we have reafon to believe that many
-ofour naturalifts had no other objett in view, as
.many of them, real men of learning and ofcandour
in their refearches, and capable of obfervation,
.have rather furnifhed arms againft, than forwarded

writ, D'Alembert writ~s a work under the title of
':The Abtift of Criticifm, a real apology of all thofe
fyftems. The main drift of the work,. was with
fhowing a great ref~Cl: for religion, to prove that
neither revelation, nor the credibility·of Mofes,
could be the leaft affected by thefe theories or
epochs, and that the alarms of the divines were
,··. ungrounded. Many pages were dedicated to prove
i.,that thefe fyftems could only ferve ·co raift! our
ideas to the grand and fubliine. That fo far from
·counterafling the power ofGod, or his-divine wifdcm,
they only dijplayed it more ; that confidering the
~bjeCl: of their refea-rches, it little !lecame the JjiJin6,

openly expreffed in his letters to Voltaire, to fee

It would be ufelefs to remark in this place, that ·
thefe very Auftrians which D'Alembert wifhes to
-fee annihil_ated, were then. the allies of France, at
war with that very King of Pruffia whofe vitlo-
ries he celebrates. Thefe circumftances might
. ferve to fhow, how much more philofophifm fway-
'
ed the heart of the Sophifter than the love of his
country, or that toleration would not have hinder-
ed the confpirators from betraying their king or
country, could they by that have made (new at-
tack on Chriftianity.
We plainly fee that all thefe inhuman wifhes ·
were rather dropped unawares, ·thart the awowed
object of their correfpondence. They' were pre-
paring the road for thofe feditious and ferocious
minds, who were to perpetrate what the Sophi·
fters yet could only devife and fcheme. The day

On' the 15th of Jan. 1761; Voltaire fends a
performance, I know not what, but which the
editor. ofhis works fuppofes to be an epiftle to Ma·
demoifelle Clairon a famous accrefs in thofe days, to
one of his female adepts, the Countefs of Argenta!, ·
whom he ftyles his angel. Beyond a doubt it was
a moft fcandalous production, fince only the
chofen of the eleCt are favored with it, or ·rather
that Voltaire dares fend it to.. In fine, what~ver
was the fubjecc, it was accompanied with the fol-
lowing letter. .

his proteCtion to thofe of Paris alone, but to the

found his pow~r infufficient, he would have re-

that it was not the inventjon of D'A~embert, but
he was aware ofthe advantages philofophifm would
derive from it, and however ftrange the plan, he
flattered himfelfwith the execution of it.
It is well kno.wn what ftrength .the Chriftian
religion draws from the fulfilling of the prophecies,
and particularlyfrom thofe ofDaniel and of Chrift
himfelf, on the fate of the Jews and of their
temple. Julian the apoftate, in order to give the
lie to Chrift and to the prophet Daniel, had fought
io rebuild the temple. It is alfo known that flames;
burfting forth from the earth, at divers times and
devouring the workmen, had obliged him to defift
from the undertaking. D'Alembert was not ~g­
norant of this aB: of the divine vengeance, having
been afcertained by a multitude of eye witnefies.
He had undoubtedly feen itrecorded in Ammianus
Marcellinus ; an author of unqueftionable autho-
rity, for he was a friend of Julian, and a Pagan
like him. But this did not hinder him from wri-
ting to Voltaire, " You probably know, that atthis
" prefent time, there is at Berlin, one of the cir-
n cumcifed, _who expeCting Ma,Jlamet's paradife,
(( .is in the mean time, gone to wait on your for-

cc a word1 it would be a fine opportunity to have Jl --1:
'' the temple ofJerufalem rebuilt •:•
That word was not faid by the former difciple,
*nd D'Alembert gives the following reafon to
Voltaire. 'cc I have no doubt but that we fhould
" have fucceeded in our negodation on the re-edi-
" fication qf the temple of the Jews, if your
'~ former difciple had not been afraid of Jofing
" fome circumcifed worthies, who would have
" carried away thirty or forty millions wirh
'' them t ." Thus in fpite of all their inclination
to give the lie to 'the God of the Chriftians, even
to the fordid intereft of the confpirators, was to
add a new pr?Of to his doctrines.
Eighteen years after Voltaire had not given up ·I·
the pl~n~- nor loft all- hopes of accomplifhing it·
Seeing that D'Alembert had not fucceeded with
Frederick, he endeavoured to prevail with the
'Emprefs .of Ruma: He writes to her, " If your

I have now laid before my re~ers, the means,

or its means, I have not reforted to h.earfay or

own ; the approximation of their letters, of their

is more than one letter which depofes againft the
Emperor Jofeph II: with all the poffible evidenc,e Jofeph u.
of fuch teftimony;-that he was ~nitia~d and had ' "A

tio~, the war which J.~fc;r>E waged, foon ·became
one of authority and Qppreffion, of rapine and
violence, and was well nigh ending in the exter-
mination of his own fubjeets. He began by the
}fuppreffion of .a large number of monafteries;
this we have feen was a leading feature in Frede-
rick's plan; he feized on a great part of the e'ccle-
'A, fiaftical property ; fo would Vol~ire have done,
when he exclaims, But I had rather plunder tbm;
Jofeph II. tote from their cells and cloifters, even
to thofe Carmelite nuns, whofe extreme poverty
could afford no bait to avarice and whofe angelic
fervor left no room for reform. He was the firft
who_gave to his age the public fuow of holy vir-
gins reduced to wander into·diftant countries, even
as far as Porrugal, tofeek an afylum for their piety.
Innovating at pleafure in the church, he only anti..
cipated that famous conftitution of the clergy,
called civil by the Jacobin legitlators, and which
prepared ·the way to the butchery at the Carmes.
The fovereign p~ntiff thought it incumbent on
, him to leave Rome and pafs_ into Auftria, and in
~he capacity of common father of the faithfuJ,
perfonally to reprefent to the emperor the laws
and rights of the church. Jofeph II. receives

his war of opprefiion. He did not expel the j..
bilhops, but he gave them much trouble; for

forward the grand apoftacy; at length thefe fecret
perfecutions and depredations gave rife to mur-
murs. The wearied Brabanters revolted. Since
that, we ·have feen them call in thofe Jacobins
who proniifing them the free exercife of their
religion, and more artful than Jofeph, are .now
confummating his work: Had they been lefs
tormented by Frederick's adept in matters of
faith, the Brabanters would have been lefs jmpa-
tient under the· yoke ~f Auftria: ~ad they been
penetrated with a greater zeal and affection for
the Emperor Jofeph, they would have better
feconded, and have had more confidence in the
virtues of Francis II. They would' with greater'
force have oppofed that· invafion which we have
f~en extend to the very banks of the Danube.
Should hiftory lay the blame on Jofeph, let it
look back to that day,_when by Frederick, he is ·
initiated into the myfteries of Voltaire. It is the .' ,
emperor· adept, that {hall be found guilty of this
war of extermination, which has threatened even

I cannot finilh this chapter without remarking,
that among the kings of the North, in whofe pro-
tection the Sophifters fo often exult, the name o.f

This filence of the confpirators, is above all the .

him too wife to coalefce with vile confpirators,

with equal fuccefs on religious or philofophical
topics. Without being wanting in the refpec9: due
to that precious half of mankind, we may obferire
i~ general, I think, that women are not born witli
a mind fo congenial with philofophy, metaphyfics,
· or divinity, as men. Nature has compenfated this
J want ofrefearch and meditation, by the gift ofem~
bellifhing virtue, by that fweetnefs and vivacity of
fentiment, which often proves a furer guide than all
our reafonings. They do the good peculiarlY.

fure their approbation. Here is a fpecirrten of the
ftyle of this illuftrious adept, aping the principles
and th~ jefts of Voltaire, in order to captivate his
approbatioh, at the expence of St. Paul. .
" Sifter Guillemetta to Brother Voltaire, greet-
" ing. l received your confoling epiftle. I can 1
" fwear by my favorite oath, th~t- it has edified ~
" me infinitely more than that of St. Paul to
" Dame Eleet. The latter threw me into a certain
" drowfinefs that had the e.ffeCl: of opium, and
·"- hindered me from perceiving the beauties
" of it. - Yours had a contrary effeCl: ; it drew
'-
' me from my lethargy, and put all my vitai
" fpiriis in motion again,•., ·
. We have no knowledge of any Epiftle of St~
Paul to Dame EleCl:; but Sifter Guillemetta, like
Voltaire, burlefquing what fhe had, as well as
-what fhe had not read, means -no doubt to fpeak
of St. John's Epiftle to EleCl:a. This contains no
other compliment but that of an ap6ftle applaud-
ing the piety of a mother,· who rears her children
in the way of life, e:dtorting her to charity~ and
~arding her againft the difcourfe and fchools or'
feducers. It is rather unfortunate that fuch leffons
Jhould have been opium for the illuftrious adept.
It is probable that Voltaire wduld have found a
dofe in the following letter, had it come from any
.other~ hand but that of Sifter Guillemetta. We

Had Voltaire or D'Alembert fpoken of an eccle-

At length, carried to the· miniftry, by the
cabals of the fett, he ufes all his power to infpire
the young king with his difguft for the monarchy,
and with ' his principles on the authority of a
throne, he had fworn to maintain as minifter. He
would willingly have transformed him into a
Jacobin king. He firft infinuates thofe errors,
which are one day to throw the fceptre into the
bands of the people, and overturn the altar and
the throne; if thofe are the virtues of a minifter,
they are thofe ofa treacherous one; if errors of the
mind, they are of a mad-man.' Nature had en.
dowed him with the:defire of relie-Ving his fellow-
creatures. He heard the declamations of the So-
phifters againft the remains of the feudal fyftem,
under which the people ftill labored, and what
with the Sophifters, was a mere tool of their
·hatred for kings, he miftook for the cry .of com-

thought his difmiffion too early, but alas I it was
not early enough; for he had already tainted the
throne with thofe revolutionary ideas on the fove-
reignty of the people; he had then forgotten that
_this was making all power depending on their
caprice; he pretended to make the people happy
by placing arms in t~eir hands, with which they
deftroyed themfelves. He thought to re-eftablilh
the laws in all their purity, and he only taught
rebelliop; he .mifieads the youthful monarch, too
unexperienced, to unravel the fophifms of the
feet ; the ¥ery goodnefs of his, heart leads him
-.frill more aftray. In the pretended rights of the
people; he only fees his own to be facrificed, and
it is from Turgot, we are to trace that fatal error

THE paffiqns and the facility of gratifying
them, the yoke of religi<;m once thrown off,
had given the.confpirators great power among the
higher claifes of fociety ; and the empty hopes
of a reputation brought over to their ftandards aU
thofe whp pretended t~ literary fame. The great

Rouffeau. That famous citizen of Geneva, fub-
lime when he pleafes in his profe, rivalling
Milton or Corneille in his poetry, could have ri-
valled Boffuet under the banners of Chriflianity.
Unfortunately for his glory, he was known to
D'Alembert, Diderot and Voltaire, and for 'a time
he leagued with them, and fought like them, the
means of crulhing Chrift and his religion. In this
fynagogue of impiety1· as in that of the'Jews, tdli-
nronies did not agree ; divifions e·nfued, but though
.feparaced, their attacks were bent againft Chrifti-
anity. This is to be feen in a letter from Voltaire
to.D'Alembert, where he fays, " What a pity it
" is that Jean Jaques, Diderot, Hdvetius and
" you, with other men of your flamp, lhould not
" have been unanimous in your attacks on the
'' wretch. Mygreateft grief is, to fee the im-
" poftors united~ and the.-friends of truth di-
" vided .... '
When Rouffeau feceded from the Sophiftt'rs, he
did not by that forfake either his own or their·er-
rors ; ne fepar~te1y carried on . the war. The ad-
miration of the adepts was divided. In .eirher
fchool, impiety had only varied its weapons, nor
were opinions more conftant or lefs impious.
Voltaire was ~the moft ·a~ive~ but vigor was
given to Jean Jaques. With the ftrength of Her-
'ulcs he ~fo partook of his delirium. Voltaire

plies ·to Sophifters bewildered like himfelf, and
remains perplexed. Jean Jaqucs, as yet a •mere
youth, fays to himfelf, " I am gQing to throw

and that all the higher claffes of citizens were led
away from the worfhip of their religion,. fome by
exampfe, others by the artful fophifms of the con-

more than its ho11or or its intereft, its very name
called on the clergy by the moft facred ties ofduty
and of confcience, to guard the altar againft the
attacks of the confpirators. The leaft backward-
.nefs in the combat would have added treafon to
apoftacy. Let the hitlorian who dared fpeak the
truth on kings, be true on the merits of his own

Prior to all thefe champions of the faith, the
·Abbe Duguet had viCI:orioufiy vindicated the
principles of :Chriftianity, and the Abbe Haute-
ville had demonftrated the truth of it from hif-
tory. From the firft dawn of the confpiracy; '
the Pere Berthier and affociates had, in the Jour·
· nal de Trevoux, particularly expofed the errors
of the Encyclopedifts. In fine if the Celli and
Porphirii were numerous, religion had not loft
· its Juftins or its Origens. In thefe latter times
as in ·the primitive days of C~riftianity, he who
fincerely fought after truth muft have found it
in the viCtorious arguments of the religious au-
thors, oppofed to the fophifms of the confpirators.
And it may be faid that many points of religion
.had been plac~d i~ a clearer light, than they had.
been before, .by thefe modern apologifts. ·
The Chriftian orators. feconded their bilhops
and perpetually called the attention of the people
to th&ir danger. The refutation of Philofophifm
was become the objeCt: of their public difcourfes.

arts that Voltaire, D'Alembert and Diderot h~
built all their hopes o( working the univerfal

to ·thefe very arts. In that awfut" moment when
glory vanifhes and that the empty name they had
acquired by their deceit is no more, the difciple

reconcile themfelves with him ~hey had blaf-
phemed, even to their very remorfe, is facrificed
to the vanity of their fchool: when it calls on
them to ufe that courage they had. fhown when
blafpheming, it fails them in their 'repentance,
and they fhow none but the Oavifh fymptoms

by that im2iety, which their hearts then abhorred.
At the time of their death, hatred to Chriftianity .

Was it to impofe on the pubJic, or to delude him-

he feems to have fucceeded in. Frederick would

pretended age of philofophy was no other than that
of vice ; than that of wickednefs organized into

Such fears may perhaps awaken them,

revolt of the foreign troops againft the
Carthaginians, after many :ilirewd ob-

turns his mind toward the times in which
he was then writing, and as early as the
year 1727, makes ufe of.the following
remarkable expreffions: " A Confpiracy
" is forming at this prefent time, gradu-
" ally gaining ground, and by meaps fo
" fubtile, that I regret my not having

the modern Philofophers, had fworn hatred to the
altar and the throne, had fworn to crufh the God
of the Chriftians, and utter1y to extirpate the Kings

Second Volume into two Parts. The firft will
develope the rife and progrefs of the Confpiracy
of the Sophifters, called Philofophers : The fecond,
of that feet, which we have denominated Occult
Mafons ( Arrieres Mafons), to diftinguifh their
adepts from the multitude of brethren who were
too virtuous to be initiated in the occult myft~ries,
too religious, and too faithful citizens to affociate
. in their plots.
After having treated feparately of thefe two con-
fpiracies, though both tending to the fame object,
we fhall fhow them leaguing together ; and by
their united efforts accomplifhing that part of the
French Revolution which effeCted the overthrow
of Religion and Monarchy, of the altar and the

Voltaire had all the habits and manners of the
great, and at his court of Ferney aCted the Gran-
dee perfeCtly well. He had too high an opinion
of his own abilities to affimilate himfelf, by Equa-
lity, to that multitude which he contemptuoufly
ftiles, the beggarly canai/1~.
Ht was not only partial.to kings, but even to
the monarchical form ofgovernment. When he
gives a loofe to his own fentiments, and in hit
hiftorical writings, we fee him invariably pre-
ferring the dominion of ONE to that of the MANY.
He could not endure the idea of having fo many
mafters as there were counfellors in the parlia-
ment •; how then could he adopt that liberty and
fovereignty of the people which would have given
him as joint fovereigns, the towns and fuburbs,
the peafantry and his own vaffals. · He who fo
much delighted in reigning in his own caftle, who
was fo jealous of his-prerogatives in the midft of
his eftates which he called his little Province, how
could he wi.Ot to fand:ion a Liberty and Equality

it is probable that Voltaire would never have

All thefe expreffions natur~lly .deno(e a man
declining towards aRepublican Liberty and Equa-
lity, and who impatiently bore the yoke of Kings.
A few years aft<::r, we may obferve this paffion
much more predominant in Voltair@, efpecially in
a letter which he is fuppofed to have written to an
Academician of Marfeilles, and mentioned in Mr.

This, however, could be no fecret to thofe who

had obferved the modern Sophifters trying to caft
all the odium of war and its miferies on Kings and
the nature of their governments, and wilhing to
perfuade .the people that their only way of ac-.
quiring happinefs, and everlafting peace, was, to
take the government into their own hands by
wrefting it from their Royal Mafters. This pro-
pofition, fo evidently contradiCted by.that perpe-
tual ftate of warfare, interior or exterior, fo com-
mon to Republics, evinces that Voltaire had no
~e about proof, when he decided in fo peremp-

his letter to the Count D'Argental on fending him
fame of thofe feditious publications, by faying, "In

tertainly could not c~itivate fuch a difpofition,
Without fc:cretly wi1hing to b~tray the caufe of hia

In fhort, it is D'Alembert who extolls the
writings of his dear and illuftrious brother, as pe·
culiarly adapted to dilfeminate thoft two principles
~ Rtpu6lican Liberty a11d Rep11blimn Phitojophy
-among perj01ts worthy offeeling them ; or, in other
words, as peculiarly adapted to fu]fil _
the wifhes of
iliofe pretended fages, who can find no liberty
under tht government of Kings, and who deteft
Monarchy in proportion to their love for Re•
publics. He who believes himfelf worthy offeel·
_lng this two-foldJentiment, he who acknowledges
no Philofophy as true if void of thefe two fenti-
ments, could he; I aik, demonftrate in a more
_
fc:ircible manner, how ardently they glowed in his
heart; or how much he panted after thofe revo•
iutions which were to crufh the throne, and efta•
blifh Republicanifm on its ruin ?
. In drawing thefe inferences, let~ot the reader
. {!zppofe that we mean to confound in all cafes a.
bias for-Republics, -or the love ofLiberty, with the
hatred ofKings,:and the defire.of fubverting every
Throne. We are perfeCl:ly-aware, that there exift

ignorant that true Civil Liberty is no lefs compa-
tible with·Monarchies than with Republics : in-
ileed, it might not be difficult to prove, that the
fubject frequently enjoys a more real and extenfive
Liberty under a Kingly, than under a Republican
"Government, efpecially if a Democracy. Bu·t
·when we behold the Sophifters perpetually com-
plaining of the Government of Kings under whom
they live, ftyling their Sovereigns Defpots, and
-fighing after the Liberty of the Republican Philo-
fapher, we are certainly entitled to view their
·-Jove for Liberty and Republicanifm as blended
with the hatred of Kings. If their blafphemies
againft Chrift, if what they call their Philofophy
·be by any means thwarted, impatient of the rein,
they burft forth into complaint, and they exclaim,
that Retifon is }hackled; that Defpotifm, Decius
Jilce, perpetually perjecutes them; or, that man is un-
fortrmate indeed when he lives under the eye of a
Monarch, or of his Minifters 111• •

avoids every thing by which he might himfell
be eventually'endangered. It is thus that he lauds
Voltaire, that he extols the zeal with whicft hi~
dear brother propagates that Republican Li~erty
and ~hilof~phy; and fearing left this -zeal fhoukt

Again; we find him informing Voltaire of the
eagernefs with which he reads and devours all thofe
writings in which that Premier Chief had c<;»m·
bined his attacks againft the Altar an~ the Throne.
We fee him applauding his farcaftic wit, and thus
addreffing him : "I am almoft angry when I learn

ple~fing or amufing Kings, who did not perceive
that the farcaftic wit and fatire of his romances and
hiftorical produCl:ions ·fell on their own headst
though feemingly aimed only at the perfons of
other Kings.
It was not every one of the adepts that had the
art of throwing the living into contempt, by
·ftriking at the dead; offlattering the perfon of the
Sovereign, and rendering fovereignty odious ; nor
1hall we find D'Alembert equally pleafed with all
thofe who appear in array againft the Royal caufe.
Some of them, too eager, faid too much; others
were awkward in their attacks, and thefe he ftyles
lnmglers who are to oefound every where •. Others
again were not fufficiently ·bold. He will allow
them wit, but he willies them to oe lejsfa'Uora/;le to
Dejpotifm; and the reader will eaflly conceive what
he would have written himfelf if his hands had not
oeen tied, when he confidentially writes to Voltaire,
I bate Dejpots almoft as m11ch as you do yourjelft.
It would be futile to objeCl:, that the hatred of
Defpotifm does not infer the hatred of Kings.
We know that ; but who are the Defpots implied
,
by our Sophifters, if not the Kings under whom
they lived. Were the Emperor of the Turks, or
the Grand Mogul, who h~d nothing to do with
our Philofophers, the objeCl:s of their repeated

complaints and hatred ? Such objeCtions are un·
worthy of being noticed. Their language is
known ; and fufficient proofs will occur to fhow,
that with the feel Dejpots or Cf'yrants and Sovereigns
~r Kings are fynonymous terms. The very affec-
tation of confounding them together fhows that
the hatred ofthe one and of the other were·blended
in the hearts of the Chiefs and of their Adepts.
In fhor,t, the compliments of D'Alembert are
not the fole proofs with which the adepts have fur4
nifhed us of the great part Voltaire had taken in
that revolution fo fatal to M~narchy, and which he
fo exultingly forefaw. Had he never aimed his
farcaftic wit, fo much admired by the fophifters, at
the perfons of Kings, frill he would have been th¢
man, at leafr in the eyes of his fchool, wh~ had
fmoothed the way, who had fcaled the rampart, to
alfail the Throne and fhiver the Scepter of th¢

the French Revolution has fince accomplifbed,

be the confequence of this municipalizing fyftem•
muft have been very ignorant of the charad:er of
Frenchmen, and efpecially of French Philofo•

politics.
Even the admiffion ofthe clergy into thefe pro•
vilional adminiftrations muft have proved a fatal
boon to the church, as it necdlarily tended to
change the fpirit of its minifters. Priefts and
bifhops were admitted, or rather called upon, to
~orm a part of thefe adminiftrations, fo foreign to
their facred functions, for the confpiracy had not
yet attained fufficient force to caft them off. The
2eal for falvation was to be fuperfeded by the wild
ambition of moving in a fphere fo contrary to
their c;alling. Already were feveral prelates di•

Whatever might have been the .confequence to

The love of the commonweal may appear to have

-is to be found in the reftleffnefS of Philofophifm, and
in that liberty of thinking which is difgufted with

called him to the ftudy of the laws ; but not con~

It was obvious, on the firft appearance of his

acquired from his travels an additional efteem·for
the government of his own country. One of the
prime caufes to which he attributes the eclat of the
Romans, is their love of a Liberty which begins
by dethroning all Kings. . The Sophifters, who
were ftill Iefs favorable to Monarchy, did not fail
to adopt this idea, to make it the leading prin."
ciple, and to inculcate.it in all their difcourfes •.
Both Montefquieu and his panegyrifts would
have been more corr¢fr, had they traced back
to this love of liberty all thofe fcourges and in·
teftine broils which harraffed Rome, from the ex-
pulfion of its Kings u.ntil the reign of the Empe.

celebrity of his name, and the weight ofhis au-
thority. The diftinCI:ion which he makes between
the principle$ of Monarchy and thofe of Republi-
canifm may convince the reader. In an ordinary
writer, the whole ofthat part of the Spirit ofLawa
would have been looked upon as the fport ofima-
gination playing upon words. But from Montef-
quieu they are received as the refult of profound
thought, fanCl:ioned by the great name of hiftory.
Let us examine whether the notions branding
Monarchy with difgrace can originate from any
thing but the abufe of terms.
His di· : H-onour, in the general acceptation of his coun-
ftinflion trymen, was the fear of being defipifed, and a

the prin- horror particularly of being looked upon as a

with the idea, applauds Montefquieu, but does not
perceive that in adopting the word he falfifies the
fentiment and metamorphofes it irlto afalft bon9111",
a ~Jrtjudite, a tbirft offanu, an ambition for Ji}Hnt-
tions or[Of' favDr ; in a word, into all the vices of
the courtier •. This was bewildeting ho11our ; it
was telling thofe bold Knights, Co zealous for their
King, that they were no more than effeminate
courtiers, ambitious men, and fiaves to a preju-
dice the fource of all the vices of Courts: an affer-
tion the more: evidently falfe, as many a French-
man replete with true honour was entirely free
from any of t:hofe ·vices. Such a difti~ion was
not only odious and difgraceful, it was alfo delu-
five, and the ddufion feems to have prevented
Montcfquieu from perceiving that hereafter Phi.:. .

only repeat the word_honour as the oppofite to vir-
ltu, tbt principle ofRepu!J/ics, and brand the Roya..
lifts with all the falfe prejudices; the ambition, and
other vices, which he had artfully afcribed tohonour.

this latter feilfe appears to be that to which Mon-
tefquku at firft alluded. It is undeniable, that
virtue ought to be more particularly the principle
ofDemocracies than ofany,other form ofGovern-
ment, they being the moft turbulent and the moft
vicious ofall ; in which virtue is abfolutely necef-
fary to control the paffions of -men~ to queJI that
fpirit of cabal, anarchy, and fattion inherent to
the Democratic form, and to chain down that am-
bition and rage of dominion over the ,people,.
' which the weaknefs of the laws can fcarcely with-
ftand.
But it would have been fatyric in the extreme to
have adopted this latter fenfe ; and Montefquieu's
great admiration. for the ancient Democracies
would never permit him to give fuch an explana-
tion of the principle. He therefore generalizes or
particularizes his definitions as fuits his purpofe.

Whatever idea the reader may have fOrmed of

Such, as every refktl:ing reader muft per¢eive;
is the real explanation of thefe principles. Th~
Revolution has only brought them into praCtice.
We have heard a Robefpierre and a Sieyes, pro•
claiming to the people, that in crtlfhing the Scep-

a Republic, they had only put virttte on the order of
· the day. ·In the tnidft of matfacres and bloodfhed,
they profaned the facred name Qfvirtue; and with
virtue in their mouths they plunged the people
into the moft horrid fcenes of vice and debauchery.

menu, and· how it may .reign amidft the ~artk}J fer-
ooitude, or the txt!fs·.~. I.Jlm:IJ I .Attributing fuch

intentions to this celebrated ·writer would moll:
certainly be .doing injuftice ·to his memory ; but
ftiU it is our duty to fpeak. uiuefervedly on what
he has written, and to 1hew what fentiments
·nations may have imbibed from his writings. It
is ~wf¢ to reflect (whatever. may have been his
intentions) on the terrible ravages which his opi-
nions, fupported by the authority of his name,
have operated in the minds of men. Error is in
its infancy with Montefquicu ; but it is the .fame
error that was afterwards, in the ftate ofmanhood,
~opted by Robefpierre. Montefquicu would have
ihrunk back with horror had he heard that Demo-
<:ratic villain place virtue for the order of tht day
with.his fanguinary Republic; but what could the
aftonifhed mafter have replied, on being told, thlll

Let genius fhrink back with horror at feeing its
errors trav~rfe the immenfe interval between Moo- ·
tefquieu and Robefpierre ; let it tremble at ita .
defpotic influence over the public opinion. Without
dcfigning any convulfion, by its very name it may
nife the moft dreadful ftorm. At firft, its errora
may be tender 1hoots ; but, daily gaining bulk and -

To form a corred: idea of the Revolutionary State of'
tendency of Montefquieu•s fyftem, we muft revert ~~och ·
to the time at which it was publifhed. Whatever Monar·
may have been the Legiftative forms in the pri- ht>'r;ft':
mitive days of the French Monarchy, it is certain on the di.
that at the time of his publication (and he avows !}O:!:rs
it) not only the King of France, but moft of the appeared.
crowned heads united in their perfons the rights of
executing the laws, of enad:ing thofe which they
conceived neceffary or conducive to the welfare of
the State, and of judging thofe who had infringed
the law •.
· The reunion ofthis Triple Power conftitutes an
•lift/uti Mo1111rcb ; that is to fay, a real Sovereign
who in his perfon concentrates the whole power
of the law. At that period the Fre~ch were far
from confounding this abfolute power with the ar-
bitrary power of the Tyrant or the Defpot. This
power was to be found in Republics and in ·mix·t
States. Here it exifted in the Senate, -or in the
affembly of Deputies ; there in the compound of
the Senate and' the ·King. The French ·nation
beheld it in their Monarch, ·whofe fupreme win,

S\lch was the received opinion in France, ·that
a (amity would have thought itfelf difhonored, if
any child, brother, or near relation were brought to

· faithful difciples, who undertook to calculate, and
that at a time when the.revolution had done away
every idea of exaggerating the happinefs of the
French people under the government of their
Kings. The revolutionift Gudin, in his annota-
tions on the above text,· and in his Supplement to
the Socia~ Contratl:, has examined and calculated,
year by year, the ftate of the population, the
deaths, births, and marriages of all the principal
towns in the kingdom during the courfe of this
century, and then proceeds : " The author of the
~' Social Contra~ fpoke a gr.and truth when he
cc exclaimed: Calculators, it is now your affair;
" count, metifure and compare. His. advice has
" been followed ; we have ·cilculated, meafured,
~' and compared, and the refulc of all thefe calcu-
~' lations has demonftrated that the population of
" France is really twenty-four millions,. though it.
" had always been fuppofed to be under twenty ;
" that the ·annual births amount to one million ;
'~ and that the population is daily increafing•

" the government was very good. It really was

" narchical Confpiracy was begun and indtfatiga-
" bly conduCted) was not expofed to fuch ca:la-
" mities; and it is certain, continues the revolu-
&e tionift Gudin, that during the whole monarchy
" there has exifted no period 'when population in-
" creafed in a more conftant and uniform progref-
" fion throughout the whole kingdom, than during
" that reign. It increafed to that amazing height,

der to a work attributed to Mr. Senac de Meilhao, and which
is very' fatisfadory on this point. It contains the following
pafi'age: " Mr, Necker at Jen&th, in a moment of pique
" againft his ungrateful children, difclofed the whole truth,
" and decla,red before dl~ Natio~ Afi'embly, that the ex~
" emptioos of the Clergy and Nobility, which had been' re-

~ tion:• Without doubt our author has by this
time formed hii opinion on the advantages of that
confl:itution ; but we can plainly fee by his enthu-
fiaftic admiration of the revolution~ and of. the
Philofc;>phers to whom he attributes the honor of
having effected it •, that he was very far from
wilhing to exaggerate the liberty anti happioefs of
France under the Monarchy. By th~ foregoing
long extract we have .no other object in view, than
that of furnifhing the hiftorian with the proper
materials (all extracted .from the greateft admirers
or chiefauthors of the French Revolution) to en-
able him to judge of thofe fyftems in which theRe-
volution originated, and to appreciate propr.rly the
wifdom or the imprudence of its authors.~B-ut to
return to Montefquieu.
Precifely at that period when V Ejpr'it du Loix
was publifhed, the French Were fo· happy and fo
,pleafed with their. Kin'g, that the furname of welt-
/Jelo'Ued ( biin aime) had refounded from one extre•
rnity ofthe nation to the other. And, unfortunate-
ly for Montefquieu, it is from this· publication
that we are to trace all thofe Philofophical reveries
on Liberty and Equality, which at firft only produ-,
ced difquiet and doubt, but which foon after created
other fyftems, that miOed the French people in

tie of affeCtion betwe-~n th~ fubjeCl: and the ino..o
narch, and generated at length the rnonfter of
Revolutions.
There is an efi'ential difference to be perceived
between Voltaire and Montefquieu. Voltaire, as
we have fhown, would willingly have endur~d a
Monarch that fhould have connived at his impiety.
He would have thought hirnfelf fufficiently free,.
f had he ·been allowed publicly to blafpheme ; and,
gt"nerally fpeaking, he was more partial ·to the
forms of Monarchy, or of Ariftocracy, than ro
thofe ofDemocracy. It was his hatred to religion
(and he hatt:d religion morethan he loved Kings.)
which plunged 'him into the municipalizing fyf..
tem.

tbority. The peaceful ages they had paffed under
their Legillative Kings little inclined them to envy
the boifterous liberty of a neighbouring country..
perhaps more celebrated for its civil broils in queft
of liberty, than for the wifdom ofits conftitution,
which, at length, fixing every mind and every
heart, had fcarcely terminated a long ftruggle
between the Monarch and the People.
Without doubt we may admire, as much as
Montefquieu, the wifdom of that pation which has
known how to model its laws according to the ex.
perience it had acquired during thofe ftruggles.
Laws, indeed, congenial to the manners which
chara~erize it, to its local firuation, and even to
its prejudices. , But is ·that conftitution, the moft
perfect perhaps exifting for a nation furrounded by
the ocean, to be equally perfect when tranfplanted
irito a continental ftate? Has not nature, by'di-
v~rfifying the foil, varied its culture ? Are men, ,
fo hettrogeneous in their characters, men that may
be vkwed under fo many different points, are they,
in order to attain happinefs and freedom, to be
reduced to one only mode of government? No;
it would have been madnefs to adopt the Englifh
conftitution in France. The genius of the French
nation muft have be.en totally changed before a
Jlr~nchman would believe himidf free where the
Englilhman does nqt even perceive the yoke of , ·
the law,; before the form(!r would refrain from

abUfing that liberty which the latter will fcarcely
tafte of; and particularly before the Frenchman
could be kept within thofe limits where the Englifu•
man refts content.
W c . are willing to ·believe, that Montefquieu
had never made thefe reftc:ctions, when, carried
away by' his, admiration for. foreign laws, he was
inventing new principles, and prefenting as con·
ftant and general.fuch truths, as would make his
countrymen view their Sovereign in the light of a
real Defpot, and the.mild government they lived
under, though fo .conformable ,to their interefts
and their genius, as that of a moft horrid .and
ihameful £lavery.
It is painful to apply fuch .a reproach to this
celebra~ed writer; but can hiftory refrain from
obferving the fatal imprdlion which fuch doctrines
muft have made on a pe0pk fo long accuftomed
to fay, fi veut /e Roi, ji veut Ja loi, (as the King

their Magiftrates ; but would it not be fomething
mot:e or lefs than kindnefs, to behold the torch,
and the man who wields it, without daring to in-
timate the intention of kindling' a blaze? How

to induce the Jacobin Club to ftyle Montefquieu ·
the Father ·OJ.Arijlocracy; and it appears that he
was led to the adoption of this idea by the fuppo·
fition that the claJs of citizens (the parliament)
to which he belonged, would·become legiOators ;
and thus, enjoying his diftin8.ive mark of liberty,
would be their own governors, and would never
obey any but their own laws. The care he had
taken not to generalize his ideas, excepting when
treating of the iOand where he had learned to ad-
mire ·them, fcreentd him from all cenfure, and
removed any imputation of his wi1hing to ove(-
turn the conftitution of his country~ in order to
introduce that of another. But fuch a precaution
did not reprefs that defire which he had kindled
in the breafts of many of his readers, a defire of
feeing that conftitution, which he 'fo much ex-
tolled, eftablifh~d in their own country, a defire

of a country where each perfon is his own.gover-

moderatiQn and candour laid further daim to the

Notwithftanding Montefquieu's referves, it was but
·natural for them to extol fo great a genius, whofe
chief error lay in having believed that their laws
) and their co~ftitution were fufficient to impart Ii-
.berty to all .nations, whatever might. be their mo·
ral or political poution on the globe.
The efteem.in which a nation, perhaps at that
time its.moft worthy r\vai, had always held Great

could never be afcertained until they had adopted

Both, in giving their icleas upon Liberty, in..

fyftems, was to be reftrained within certain limits
with Montefquieu, .or expand itfelf to any lengths

All thefe revolutionary principies muft have been

, arid rebellion in the SubjeB:, which, teaching the
true worfhip of the King of Kings, does not inftil
pride into nations by fiunning them with the re-

·avowal of the confpiracy, but the exulting pride
of the Sophifter wha glories in his crime. He
paints the hypocrify, the wickednefs, the hide~
· ou{hefs of his crime in as glowing colours as if he
had delineated the triumph of genius and wifdo'm,
in a word of true Philofophy, in the ca~ of the
happinefs of mankind. Let us attend, and .we

J O:ill fear its being objeCted, that the Philofo.

words Dtjpotijm and 'l'yranny. I have already faid,
that the Defpots and Tyrants whom the Sophifters
were to deftroy could be no other than thofe Mo-
, narchs under and againft whom they did confpire J
and if the unfortunate Lewis XVI. w~s a Tyrant
and a Defpot in their eyes, the mildeft and the
moft moderate of Monarchs mqft have been guilty
of Tyranny and Defpotifm. But let it not be
thought that thefe confpiring Sophifters were al·
ways reftrained by a fenfe of fhame from cafting
afide the veil. of Defpotifm and Tyranny with
which they had fhrowdt:d the.hatred they had con.;.
ceived againft Royalty. · The. fame Condorcet
who may be fuppofed (at the head of the Sophi-

Royalty is not only unneceffary and uklefs bill t'Vell

continues : " As to the reafonings which may be

the tft of January 1790, this adept, whO was de·
fenedly looked upon as one of the moft lear~d
of the fed:, begins his obferwtions and memoirs
with ·thefe remarkable words : " At length tht
" happy day is come when Philofophy triumpht
" over all its enemies. They are obli~d to own,
" that it is the light which Philofophy has
" fpread, more efpecialty of late years, that has
" produced the great events which wj/J di)ingtdjb
" the end of 'this centttry." What are thefe greac.
events which the learned Atheift claims in the
name of Philofophy r They,are thofe of a Revo-
. lution which difcovers man /;realting the jhadciu of
jlavery, and fuaking offthe yQke·with which auda..
cious Dejpots had burth'!ned them. It is the peo-
ple. recovering their inalienable right, of making
alone the laws, of depoftng Princes, of changing
or continuing ·them according to their will and

-other light than as men who cannot infringe thefe
popular laws without onng guilly of lrtt!fon to the
people. -Left the ··principles on which thefe pre-
tended rights were founded fhould be forgotten, he
' repeats them with enthufiaftic eloquence ; left the .
glory of fuch leffons and their confequences fhould
be attributed to any but the r:nafters of his fchool ;
left, in 1hort, the intention and concert ofits authors
fhould not be fu.fficiently evident, h~ teJls us~ and
that at the vtry moment when the unfortunate
Lewis

Lewis XVI. is the fport of that iegiflative and
fovereign pop~lace, " It is thefe truths repeated
" thoufands and thoufands of times by the Philo-
" fophers of humanity; that have operated thofe
'' precious effeCls, fo long expeCted;" he care•
fllll}' adds, chat if France is the firft to burft the
fetters of Defpotifm, it is becaufe the Philofophers
had prepared them for fuch noble efforts by a multi-
tude of excellent writings. And that we ·might be
acquainted to what extent thefe fuccelfes prepared
by Philofophy are. to be carried by.the concert of
thefe leffons repeated _
thottjands and tboujands of
times, the .adept La Metherie continues; " The
' ,(( filme lights are· propagating throughout other
" nations, and foon they will cry out like the
" French, we t~re determined to he free-Let the
" brilliant fuccefs which Pbilqjophy has jujl gained
tc .be a new fpur .to their courage-Let U$ he per•
"' Juaded. t~~~ fJur labours wilt nfll befruitlejs."
The foundation of this hope (and never let the
hiftorian lofe. fight of this obfervation, fince the
Philofophers ·inceffantly repeat it) refts on the
profpe& of an approaching Revolution in religi·
ous matters. It is becaufe ftch tqually inimical
to Ro~Ity and Chriftianity are daily incre~fing in
numbers and ftrength, particularly in North Ame-
rica and in Germany. It is becaufe the new tenets
arefilently propagated, and.that aH thefe fcCl:s unite-
their efforts with thofe of Philofophi(m.

He delineates the extent of their hopes, by de-
claring that Philofophy, after having conquered
Liberty in America and France, will carry its
conquefts on.the one fide into Poland, on the other
·into Spain and Italy, and even into Turkey; nay,
more, that it will penetrate into the moft diftant
regions ; ana that.Egypt, Syria, and India itfelf,
filall be tributary to it •. _
Were it neceffary to feek further proof that this
Revolution had ·been the work of the combined
efforts, of the wifhes and labors ofour modern
Sophifters, La.Metherie will tell us,/that he had
clearly 'anno~ced it to all Sovereigns when he
faid, " Princes, do not deceive yourfeJves-TILL

" by his follow citizens. The whole power of

Another Pbilofopher not lefs vain than· La G~:li11.
Metherie, e)(tolling and revealing the plans, in.,.
tentions and plots of the' feet; with nearly as much
J)erfpicuity as Condorcer, is aHo acknowledged
by it for one of its profoundeft adepts. This is
Gudin, who, adding his reveries to thofe of Jean
Jaques, makes the glory of his 'mafters confift not
only in the principles and the wifh of the revolu-
tion, but in all they bad done to bring it about,
and which enabled them to annw.nct it as infallible.
This adept Gudin goes much further; for he
tells us, that it was not the intention of the Philo-
.fopbers to operate this Revolution by the arm of
the! people, but by means of the King and his
Minifters ; that th~y had forewarned them that it
was in vain far them to pretend to ftop it. Accord-
ing t-o him, " thefe fame Philofophers who,,under
cc the ancient order of things, had told the King,
" his Council, and his Minifters, that thife changes
" would talce place inJPite ofthem, if thty would nDI
" adopl them, fay at this prefent day to thofe who
cc oppofe ·cbe conftitution, that it would be -im-

" rnent, whichever might be the party that car•
" ried the day, it being too imperfeCt and too
" much difcr.edited even by the enemies of the
" new conftitution •."
Thefe me~ therefore, whom we fee to-day~
under the n.ame of Philofophers, fo numerous and
fut:h zealous partizans of that Revolution which
dethrones Kings; which invefi:s the Sovereignty
, in the hands of the people, and executes fyftems
the. moft ·dire&ly oppofite to the authority of
Monarchs ; thefe men, before they attempted to
accomplifh their plans by the arm of the people,
had already revolutionized the public opinion to
I
that degree, and were fo certain of their fuccefs,
that they boldly threatened both Kings and their
Minifi:ers, if t~ey would not adopt their Revolu•
tionary ideas, with die completion of that long
wi1hed for Revolution, in fpite of all oppofition.
It would be endlefs to quote the multitude of
proofs which atteft, that Philofophifm only waited
for the fuccefs of its plots, to gl<>ry in having con-
trived them. The·hiftorian will find thofe proo&
in the numerous difcourfes pronounced by the
adepts, either at the legiflative club called Na-

crimes perpetrated and in the plots·framed againft
the Altar and the Throne, No, this is the fhame-
faced and repenting .adept, whom forrow and re· •
morfe oblige to reveal a fecret .burfting from him
in the agony of grief. But both the repentant and
the proud adept perfettly agr.ee jn their evidence.
For it would be a ftrange error to believe, that the
· declaration ofLe Roi and the objeCt ofhis remorfe
were confined to the Antichriftial\ Confpiracy. At
the period when he made his declaration neither
the conftitution nor the oath of apoftacy had been
decreed. It ha.d not as yet been propofed to plun-
der and profane the temples, and to abolilh the
public worfhip. No blow had been given to the
fymbol of Chriftianity. All was prepared and
daily ftarting into exifterice ; but as yet the alfem-
bly had only trc:fpaffed againft the political autho-
rity and the rights of their Sovereign. It was at
the fight of thefe firft crimes that Le Roi is re-
proached with ·the miferable effeCts of his fchool,
and it was to this reproach he anfwered, Cf'o whom
do youjayjo ? I know it but too welt, and I foal/ die
of grief and remotft. When he difdofed all the
beinoufnefs of the plot frjlmed by.his fecret aca-
demy at the.Hotel d'Holbach, when he declares
· that it was there that the Confpiracy, whofe dire
effects they then beheld, had been formed and
carried on ; the plots which he detefts are thofe
that he fees attacking the Throne. If he declares

thofe at the fame time which had been formed
againft the altar, it is becaufe they had been the
forerunners of the above, becaufe it was neceffary
to (how that the hatred which the people had con- ·
ceived for their King, arofe from that which had
been inftilled into them againft their God. Thus
while the declaration of this unhappy adept au-
thenticates the confpiracy of the Sophifters againft
religion, it equally demonftrates that contriyed
againft the Throne.
It would be in vain to object that this unhappy
man loved his King ; he calls all prefent to wit-
nefs that he isattached to the perfon ofLewis XVI.;
how could he t~en join in a confpiracy againft
.him ? But it is in vain, all is ·confiftent, all is
eombined in this mind racked with remoife. This
unhappy Secretary of the Confpiring Academy
might have loved the perfon of the Mona~ch, but
detefted Monarchy, detefted it at leaft as it exift-
ed, and in the light in which his mf\fters had
taught him to confider it, that is to fay, as irre-
concilable with their principles of Liberty, Equa .·
1ity, and Sovereignty ofthe people. . We fuall fee
hereafter, that opinions differed very much in this
· fecret academy. . Sof!le wifhed to have aKing,
or at leaft to preferve the appearance of one in the
new projected· order of things; others, and they
were to carry the.day, objected to the very name
or any appearance of Royalty, and both parties

were unanimous in their attacks againft Royalty as
then exifting. The one wifhed for a Revolution
partly combined of Montefquieu's fyftem, partly
ofJean Jaques's. The ·other wifhed to eftablifh
it on the confequences which Jean Jaques had
deduced from Montefquieu's principles. But both
were leagued in Rebellion, and botp confpired to
bring about a Revolution. The repenting adept
wanted a half Revolution, nor did he believe that
the people, when put in motion, would proceed
to thofe exceffes which he detefted. He flattered
himfelf' ~hat the Confpiring Philofo_phers who
ftirred up the populace would. be able to diretl:
its motions; that they would infpire this populace
with a proper refpe& for the perfon and even for
the dignity of a Prince whom he loved and re.
' fpeCl:ed as a Frenchman and a_Courtier, while as a
Sophifter he dethroned him. This is all that his
remorfe and his proteftations of attachment (or
the perfon of Lewis XVI. can indicate. He
wifhed 'to make him a King fubfervient to the
views and fyftems of th~ Sophifters, and he re-
duced the unfortunate Monarch to be the objetl: of
the· licentiou~ outrages of the· populace ; fuch
are the real. caufes of his grief and remorfe.
But the more this remnant of affeetion for his
King appears in his ·declaration, the more it cor-
roborates his avowal. It is not without·caufe that
~ man accufes himfelfof having pierced the bofom

of the perfon he loves, or of having been con-.
cerned in a confpiracy againft a Monarch wbofe
Throne he with regret beholds menaced with ruin.
People do not accufe themfelves of crimes which
they dereft. Let us· weigh the declaration of the
rep~nting adept. What has Condorcet, proud and
vainly explting in the Confpiracy ofPhilofophifm
againft the Throne, told us, which the unhappy
Le Roi li~king under .fhame and remorfe has ·not
confirmed ?
-x:heir.te- The haughty adept tells us, that of the difciples
!:~nJes ofVoltaire and Montefquieu, that is to fay, of all
pared. the. principal authors of that impiety and'rophifti-
cated polity ofthe age, a fchool or fed. was formed
uniting and combining their labors and their
writings to effeCl:uate the fucceffive overthrow of
the religion ofChrift and of the ~hrones of Kings.
The repentant adept'fhows us thefe fame difciples
ofVoltaire, M9ntefquieu, and Jean Jaques, unit-
ing and coalefcing under the fiCl:itious name of
<Economifts at the Hotel d'Holbach; and he fays
it was there that the adepts dedicated their labors
and their lucubrations to the perverlion of tho
public opinion on' the facred fubjects of Religion
and the rights of the Throne. " Moft of thofe

" fpoke more openly*." As to its objetl:, .its
means, and its authors, we fee the account of thiS
double confpiracy perfectly coiociding, whether '
given by the haughty Condorcet or the repenting
Le Roi. Both demonftrate this fchool confpiring
againft their God and againft their King, flattering
themfdves with· fuccefs ageinft Monarchy, and
generating that Revolution which was to overturn

fters, threatened but a flight refiftance to their

he thinks he may violate it without endangeri"9

it is equally certain, that thefe fame produtl:ions,

on the French Calvinills, and cried out, "It is thofe wretches,
"I fee it clearly, it js thofe men for whom I have done fo

the fame wifhes againft the Throne being cotn·

to throw new light on· the Confpiracy. Let the

of the irreligious Encyclopedifts, all his conduce
in fhort, will corroborate his teftimony when he
paints ~hefe Sophifters as empty fages confpiring
tqually againft the altar and the throne. . And
the time came when Frederic II. perceived ·that
his dear Philofophers, by initiating him into-their
rnyfteries of Impiety, had let him into but half
their (ecret ; that by employing his power to
crufh Chrift, they had planned the deftruction of
his throne and the .extirpation of Monarchy.· Fre-

and revenge fucceed his admiration, and he blufues

.made him their to'?l to undermine that powc:r
which he was mo{t jealous ofpreferving.

Encyclopedifts who owed the greateft part oftheir
{uccefs to his proteCl:ion. He warned Kings, that

weight to 'the adepts, and contributed to the fe•
·duttion of the people; and contempt was the moft
powerful weapon that could be employed againft

thefe pretended fages ~s puffed up with their own

-may be his ftyle, it is to guard Kings and Nations

tOmetimes lay afide his epigrammatic ftyle and
think it incumbent on him to condefcend to ~e
refutation of the grofs calumnies which his Sophi-

tive power. They were ftimulated by the infinua.

which he wilhed to inftil into them. To the ci-
tizens he would urge, that their legiOative power
abfolutely made the magiftrates dependent on them;
and. he would perfuade the natives or inhabitants,
that living in the fame Republic and fubject to the
f.1me laws, the equality of nature a~milated their
rights to thofe ofcitiZens ; that the time was come
when they lhould ceafe to be flaves, or to obey
laws·which they had not made; that they were no
longerto be victims offuch odious diftinctions, or
fubject to taxes difgraceful, inafmuch as they were
levied without their having confented to them•
. Such infinuations ~cquired new vigour from the
numerous pamphlets flowjng from the fertile pen
.of the. Premier Chief. Under the name of a Ge-
nevefe he publilhed the Republican Ideas, which
will always bear teftimony of his. hatred for Kings,
and 1how how much ground Republican Liberty
had gaioed in his heart as he advanced in years.

To us it appears, tb.at, whether y01.1ng or old; Voltaire
oftenconfounds all his ideas. The idea of nobility, in gene..
ral, reprefents to us the children of men diftinguilhed by
their Cervices either civil or military, forminc a body in t~•

what an impreffion fuch writings muft have made,
profufely fpread about, and diftributed with that
art which we have feen Voltaire defcribing, when
he wifhed to infufe his venomous doCtrines into the
loweft claffes of the people.
But means ftill more perfidious were made ufc::
of. The Sophifters have been feen extoUing the
generofity of their Premier ; and, as a proof, they
cite the multitude of Genevefe artizans who taking
'refuge at Ferney found a new country and pro-
teCtion in Voltaire's little province, and partook
fufficiently of his ·riches to continue their trades
and fupport their families. But when we interro-
gate thofe who on the fpot could obfc:rve the fecret
motives :of fuch a perfidious generofity, we hear
them anfwer, " Voltaire, it is true, has been in
fome fort the founder of Ferney, of a new town;,
but they will add, how did he people it, if it was
not with thofe faCtious citizens whom he had ftirred
up againft their country, and which he reunites at
Ferney and Verfoi to form a focus of infurreCtion,
which was to force the unhappy Republic, by the

rights of the ancient conftitution, not to form a
new one; and from antiquity alone he appears to
draw all his arguments in favor ofthe Equality and
Sovereignty of the People.
The moft revolutionary am~ng the Genevefe
were furprized to fee a foreign Sophifter informing
them, that till then they h~d been ignorant of their
own laws ; that all thofe diftintl:ions of citizens, in-
habitants, or natives, and all the privileges of the
firft, were novelties which had been ufurped and
introduced into the Republic fo lately as the year
i707; that before that period a very 1hort rdi-
denct- entitled every new comer " to the rights
" of citizen, and to be admitted into the general

" his 1hare of Sovereignty in the Republic ; in
cc 1hort, that the moft perfect equality had reigned

This was nearly the fame plan which the fea

It i4J true, the Sophifters did not long enjoy
their fi1ccefs, as Mr. de Vergennes, who at firft
had viewed this Revolution.with indifference, foon
learned its importance. Evidence at length con-
vinced him:that all that had come to pafs at Ge-
neva was nothing·more than an elfay which our
modern Sophifters were making of their principles
and fyftems i that neither their plans nor their

celfes; that they wcrre nothing more than a pre-
lude to the revolutionary fcenes with which they
threatened all Europe, and which might ere long
involve France itfelf in the common mafs of ruin.
The Sophifters had the mortification to fee
thefe firft fruits of their revolutionary principles
blafted by a few battalions of French troops. It
was referved to Clavierre, and afterWards to Ro-
befpierre, to refume their plans, and to fend the

for his charatl:er. At leaft fuch has been the
defence I have heard him make to juftify himfel{
from the cenfures of the Sorl:ionne. He had the

and during his whole life that ·was his favourite
~ topic ; he believed himfelf tranfcendant i~ that

were led to
the fame belief. His mediocre talents would have
been better appreciated; had he been viewed in
the light of a man led away by the prejudices he
had imbibed from a fcanty knowledge ~f anti~
quity, and who wifhed to reduce every thing to
the ftandard of his own ideas.
Mr. de Mably had alfo been led away by all
thofe Syil:ems of Liberty, of the Sovereignty and
Legiflative authority of the people, of the rights
of felf-taxation and of contributing to the public
expences only in as much as they had voted the
monies themfelves or by their reprefentatives.-
He was perfuaded that he had found thefe Syftem9
of Government among the ancient Greeks and
Romans, and more particularly among the ancient
Gauls. He was perfectly perfuaded, that with-

very laws the States-General .owed th~ir former

Princes had found themfelves under th~ neceffity
ofapplying to thofe States for fubfidies, the re~
fon was, becaufe under the feudal fyftem.the King,

. Thefe diffentions 1\'err principally owing to an
opinion .originating in Montefqu1eu's fyftems,
which had crept into the firft tribunals of the
ftate. Such magiftrates as, according to that fy..
ftem, believed Liberty to be entirely annulled in
every ftate where the people or 'its reprefentatives
did not partake of the legifiative and fifcal powers
with the King, had conftrued their Parliaments
·into thereprefentatives ofthe people, and pretend-
ed that the different Parliaments, though difperkd
in' different towns throughout the ftate, confti- . -
tuted but one and the fame body, holding their
powers direCtly from the pt>ople, whofe, perpetual
reprefentatives they pretended to be, whofe rights
they were to fupport againft the encroachments
ofthe crown, and exercifing for them that inalien-
able and indefeafable right of making Jaws and
voting fubfidies ; although they were refident rna..
giftrates and fixed in different towns by the King
to adminifter juftice in hi$ name. · ·

fo much (\t the difpofition of the Sovereigns, that
they had fold the offices ; could then thefe men

latter only that our Kings had perpetuated under the name of

' great AJremblies or States General never meddled with the
Judiciary.Power, the exercife of which conftituted the fole
funtHons of the ambulant Magiftracy. In thofe great Af..
{emblies or National Plaids the Clergy was always admj.tte<l

was formed at Prague, and it was to break out on
the J 6th of May. It was cuftomary on that day
.for multitudes of the common people to throng
~nto tOWJ4 to celebrate the feaft of St. JeanNe-
po!llucene. At the time of this immenfe concourfe
of people from the country, fome thoufands of

belonging to the Lord. In the middle of a large hall were
vaft heaps of corn; around the place as many divifions as
there were families in the village, and each divifion contained
the corn belonging to one family. An overfeer attended at
the dilh:ibutions, which were made once a week. If the
.fiock of any particular divifion was exhaufted, the nece1fary
_
quantity was t;lken from, the Lord's heap for the family in

what might be wilhed for under every adminifl:ration; .but it .

· The Sophifters feared the delay attendant on

the Sophifters, w1dcr the cloak of Humanity and
Liberty, were inventiNg every means either for.
the deftruction of the Nobility, or to oblige the
Lords. to renounce their ancient rights over their
vaffals and villains, and that the orders given by-
Jofeph 11. for the mode of defence of the fron.
tiers of Tranfilvania furnifhed the means or the
eccafion for executing their plans~ Thefe orders
were fuch, that they were calculated either to rob
the HQngarian Lords of their vaffals, or to throw
them into open rebellion againft their mafters.
Antecedent to this new plan adopted by the
Emperor, the chain of troops deftintd for the·
guard of the Turkifh frontiers Wa'i compofed of
peafants or villains, who were exempted from a

numerous reclamations being made. What feemed
to juftify this oppofition, and what was eafy to be
fure(een (which perhaps might have been, the
real object of the Sophifters), was, that the peafan·
try flocked in crouds to be enrolled, and by that
means enfranchize themfelves from all fubmiffion

We have witneffed the fanguinary confequences of
thefe vain fyftems of Liberty and Equality in our
own timt"s ; let us venture to examine for a mo:..
rnent what courfe they took in the days of our
anceftors.
In 1358 France had its Jacobins, and their
fyftem was Liberty and Equality. .Froiflard, one
of the moft efteemed French Hiftorians, paints
their conduct as follows : ·
" In· the month of May IJS8 France was
" ftricken with a ftrange defolation. Some country
" people, without a chid~ and at flrft not one
" hundred in number, atfembled in the Beau-
" voifis, declaring that the nobility were a difhonor

"· act to deftroy them ·all. . Their companions
" anfwered; ' It is true, and evil fall upon the
tc Irian who !hall not do his utmoft to deftroy
'' the nobility.' They then gathered together,
" having no other arms than fticks tipped witli
" iron,· and knives, and immediately proceeded
" to the neighbouring manfion of a nobleman:
" After having murdered him, his wife and chil-
." dren, not fparing the infant babes, they fet fire
" 'to his houfe. They then proceeded to anothe.t

" They treated feveral other country houfes ~d
" caftles in the fame manner. Their numbers in•
. " creafed to fix thoufand, and they were joined
'' every ~here as they we~t by their equa4 ;_the

" and children with them to the diftance often or··

" wretches, without chiefs, buffetted, burnt, and

" committed the greateft exceJI'es and horrors
n (deedsthatneithercannor ought to be defcribed)
rt was the moft exalted among them, and looked
" upon as the moft diftinguilhed leader. I could
·~' not dare recite the treatment which women
~c met with from them. Among other horrors

Hiftorian accufes them of having cruelly revenged
themfelves op a multitude of unhappy perfon~,
who had only joined the revolters through com.. _
pulfion. A cruel Magiftrate condemned them all
indifcriminately, and in fuch numbers, that ·an ·
Auftrian Major threatened to make him refpon-
fib~ to the Emperor for all the innocent blood
which he had·fpilt.
This harfh treatment ofthe prifoners ftimulatcd
Horja and his fellowers to new cruelties againft the
' nob'ility. He. intrenched himfelf again in the
mountains, and they in vain offered him a general .
amnefty. He was beginning to renew his depre..
dations the following year, when he was taken by. .
a ftratagem. The infurgents:, dif~oncerted, craved
peace, and·laid down their arms.

point of view this terrible infurreetion would be
fOreign to the ·objea of.our memoirs. But the
infurred:ion of the negroes may alfo be attributed
to the harfhnefs of the treatment they underwent ;
yet it is neverthdefs univerfally known,, that all
the atrocious crimes and barbarities committed by
the infurgent flaves againft their mafters at St. Do:.
mingo, Martinico, and Guadaloupe, are to ·be
traced to the plots combined by the levelling So-.
phifters in Paris.
It is preciiely in a fimilar light that the infur-
rection in Tranfilvania is repufented in a narrative
which we received from a per~n who was more iD
~he way of obferving the progrefs of Philofophifm
in Vienna and the other Auftrian dominions. He .
was acquainted with their plots, he refuted the
pretences, and forefaw the fatal confequences; he
even more than once declared them to the Au-
ftrian government ; but he was not more hearken-
ed to than many others whofe words have been
but too fata:Ily verified by the horrid Revolution.
In the memoirs o( this accurate obferver on the
infurreetion of Tranfilvania, I fee him combine
the efforts of our modern Sophifters with thofe of .

This argument alone might fuflic~ to except

the grand myfterie~ of Mafonrj. · We will alfo
.treat of it~ origin and of· its propagation; in tine,
of its coalition with the confpiring Sophifters, and
of the means it afforded them of executing their
plans againft the altar and the throne.
Until the 12th ofAuguft 1792, the French Ja-
cobins had only dated the anrials of their Revolu..-
tion by the years of their pretended Liberty. On
that day Lewis XVI. who had been declared forty-
eight hours before to have forfeited his right to
the crown, was carried prifoner to the Tower of
the Temple (fo called becaufe it formerly be-
longed to the Knights Templars). On that day
the rebel atfembly decr~ed, that to the ·date of
Liberty, the date of Equality fhould be added in
fUture in all public a~s, and the decree itfelf waS'
dated the fourth year of Likrty~ the firft year and
firft day of Equality.
It ·was on that day, for the firft time, that the
(ecret of Free-mafonry was made public; that ·
fe.cret fo -dear .to them, and.which they.preferved
with all the folemnir:y of the moil: inviolable oath.
At the reading of this famous decree, they ex-
tlaimed,' We have at lengthfucceeded, a·nd Franc~

I witneffed this enthufiafm, I heard the -conver-.
fations to which it give rife. I faw Mafons,
till then the moft -referved, who freely and openly
declared, " Yes, at length the grand objeCl:: of
" Free-mafonry is accomplifhed, EQ.YALITY and·
cc LIBERTY ; all men are equal and brothers; all
"- men are free. That was the whole fubftance of
" _
our doCtrine, the object of our withes, THE'
" WHOLE of our GRAND SECRET." Such was the
lahguage I heard fall .from the moft zealous
Mafons, from thofe whom I have feen decorated
with all the infignia of the deepeft Mafon~y, and
who enjoyed the rights of YeneraJ,/e to prdide
over Lodges. I have heard them exprefs them-..
felve$ in this manner before thofe whom Mafons·
would ,call the .propbane, without requiring the
fmalleft fe(:recy either from the men or women·

In the mean time, befOre we have accounted for.
this difference, let not the Mafon, whatever may
be his degree, inculpate us if as ill Paris this fa-
mous fecret ceafes to .continue one. Too many of·
the prophane were acquainted with it in that Re-
volutionary country~ for it to remain a fecret in
others. Even thofe in England· who may ftill
wifh to keep it, will vainly object that we have
been mifled ; they will foon fee . whether it was

like the French Revolution, to thefe two words
Liuerty a11d Equality. -
I once more conjure the upright Mafons .not to
look upon themfelves as accufed of wifhing to .
cftablilh a funilar Revolution. When I Lhall have
verified this article of their dotl:rine, the efi'ence
and. the bafis of all their myfteries, I will 1how
how it came·to pafs that fo many noble and virtu-
ous charad:ers were initiated without even fufpect•
ing the ultimate defign. But for the hiftory of
the Revolution, it is necefi'ary that the moft diftant
doubt 1hould not fubfift as to this [11ndamental
ftcrtt. If this were not made clear, it would be
impoffible for the reader to comprehend the help
'l79 ··
which the Sophifters of Rebellion and Impiety
acquired -from Ma(o~ry. ·. I fhall therefore feek Other
other proofs befide thefe avowals, which many !h~~;~
others muft have heard like me from the adepts,
Iince their fuccelfes in France had made them re•
gard fecrecy in future as fuperfluous.
Antecedent to thefe avowals, there was an eafy
method of difcovering that Liberty and Equality
were the grand objecb of Mafonry. The very
name of Frte·mafon carries with it the ide~ of
Liberty·; as to Eq11ality it was difgt)ifed under the
term Fraternity, which has nearly a fimilar figni-
fication. But who has not heard the Mafon brag
of the ,Equality which reigned. in their Lodges,
where Princes and Nobles, the rich and the poor,
aU '

- all were equal, all were brothers: That diftintl:rons
of rank no longer exifted when onc:e paffed 'the.
I'yler *; and that the fole appellation ufed among
them was that of Brother; the only name alfowhich
· gives lls an idea of perfect Eq~ality.
It is true, that it was exprefsly forbidde_n to any
. Mafon ever to write thefe two words Liberty a11d
Equality confecutively, or give the leaft hint that
their fecret refided.in the union ofthefe·two grand
principles; and th~ law was fo exactly obferved
by theit writers, that I do . not remember ever to_
have feen it tranfgrdfed among the numerous
volumes -which I have read, though· of the .moft

They had agreed on that-day to reeeiw anap-

with all the ordinary forms, in order that I might
.Jearn it, though only a fpeCl:ator. · It would be
ufelefs to fwell this chapter by defcribing the cere.;

firft dt>grees, they appear to be. nothing more than
a childifh play. I may refer my readers. to the
Key of-Mafonry (La Clef de Ma~ons) or .to the
Free-mafons Cacechifm, and fome other books of
the fort, which are perfeCtly exaCt as ·to the cere..

· The grand objeCt for ·me·was to learn the fa...

comes when the poftulanr- is ordered to approach
· nearer to the Venerable. Then the brethren who
had been .armed with fwords for the occafion draw...
ing up in two lines held, their fwords..elevatcd,.
leaning the points toward each'other, and formed
what iri Mafonry is called the 41"-&k.of./J.t~l., The

elevated on two fteps, at the fartheR: end of the
Lodge. The Mafter, feate<lin an arm chair, or a
fort of thrObe, behirid this altar, pronounced along
difcourfe on the inviolability of the fecret which
was to be imparted, and on the dangtr of breaking
the path which the candidate was going to take*
He pointed to the naked fwords which were al~
ways ready to pierce the breaft of the traitor, and ·
declared to him that it was impoffible to efcapc
their vengeance. The candidate then fwears,
" that rather than betny the fecret, he confents
~' to have his head cut off, his heart and entrails
." torn out, and his alhes caft before the wind.''
Having taken the oath. the Mafter faid the follow-
ing words to him, which the reader may eafily con-
. ceive have not efcaped my memory, as I had ex~
peeled them with fo much impatience, " ·My dear
" brother, the fecret of Mafonry confitb in thefe
cc words, EQ.YALJTT AN.D LIBERTY; 41/ men ar_e
'f equal andfrte; a/J men are brethren." TJle Ma-
fter did ~ot utter another fyllable, and every body
embraced th~ new brotber tqiUll and free. The
~ge broke up1- an4 we gayly adjourned to a
Mafonic rc:paft.
I was fo tar from fufi>ecting any further meaning
in this famo'JS fecret, that I could fcarcely refram
from burfting into a fit of laughter on hearing it,
.and With the greateft fimplicity told thofe who had

~ Alld ctrtainly there was no occafwn ior being .a

are the children ofone ·commM parellt, the c~n­
tures ofthe fame God, we are to love and help
each other as brethren ; fuch ttuths certainly are ·
better taught in the Gofpel than by the chifdilA
rites of Mafonry. I muft fay, that though the
·Lodge was ·nurnerouOy atttnded, I did not fee a
'fingle craftfman who gave any other interpretatiQn
to this famous fecret. The reader will fee that it
was necelfary to g0 through many other degrees
:before they were initiated into a very different
Liberty and Equality, and even that many who
rofe to higher degrees were never initiat'ed into
the ultimate fenfe of their famous fe.cret.·

of the craft, does not authoriie the brother when.
out of the Lodge to derogate from that refpetl: and
deference due to the rank which ,any perfon bears

and titles. I have alfo remarked in the fecret in-

letl:ures to conciliate the Liberty and Equality of
the craft, with fidelity and fubmi,ffion t;o the Jaws,

his brethren ; and we prophane beings may draw
the following conclufions from his lectures •.
Every Mafon who wilhes to be admitted into ,
.the Scotch degrees, and even into all other de-
grees of Mafonry, is firft taught that until thac
period he has lived in flavery, and it is on that
account only that he is admitted into the prcfen<;e

on the difpofition they.obferved in him. If they

they reptefented to him, that there exifted an in·

fpetl: to the Liberty and Equality of the children

was, a wifh for a Revolution which fhould revive.

the craft of all thofe fools for whom the Occult
Mafons fet up the Prophetels La Broufl'e, fo fa-

again was that of the weak-minded Varlet, the

neither Religion nor Government in view ; and

the hatred of Chriftianity, or that ofKings.
Their laws and inftitutes with refpea to Reli-
gion are comprehended in declaring, ." That a
cf Mafon will never be a ftupid Athieft nor an ir-
" religious Libertine. That though in forme.
,, times .every Mafon was· obliged to profefs ·the

laws do not oblige the Englilh Mafon to be 4
Deift, but·only to be an honeft man, whatever IPI-J
be his religion.
With regard to the civil powers, a part oftheir
la,ws are expreJfed as follows : " A Mafon fhalllx

religious tenets of thefe different clatfes, and we
1hall find that, like our modern· Sophifters, they
only agree in one poi~t, and that is in their hatred
to Chriftianity and Revelation ; in all other points
we lhall find them-in perfea oppofition to one
another with refpetl: to their religious tenets or
rather blafphemous impieties.

The reader will naturally conclude, that according
to this fyffem nobody could exercife a lawful au•
thority over his equals, but in right of his virtues,
his experience, and his means of ·being ufeful.
And that is in reality the firft artifice of the feet,
. which immediately overthrows all idea of heredi·
tary fucceffion, which fubmits ·the rights of the
Sovereign to the reveries ofthe factious and of the
populace on the virtue, talents, and fuccefs ofhim
who governs. But let us follow their wind~ngs,

Thefe words etidently fhow, that in the fenfe of
the Martinift, he only is not King who is not ar-

appears, that this diffe!rence·alone tan conftitute a

which were naturally.to be expeB:ed from their

them not only with being lax in their former vir•

As

me to be correa, becaufe .the execution of the Grand Maller
certainly took place while the Commiifaries of the Pope were
at Paris, ·and they only refided there from Auguft IJ09 till
May 1311. It is in vain to alledge the proteft of the Al>bot
of St. Germain as Lord of the ManoJ againft the execution of
two Knights Templars on his land; for, ful'pofing this re~
garded the execution of Guy and Molay, we h.ave the anfwer

As a laft refource in defence of the order, .tho
very nature and infamy of the crime~ of which the

Templars were accufed have been alledged as a
proof of their innocence. But moft certainly tho
more infamous thofe crimes, the more debafed

ever infamous and incredible, only _ferve to difco-

that whole provinces were to be excepted froll\

II This certainly cannot mean that two thirds of
the Knights had equally partaken of thefe abomi-

detefted them as foon as they were acquainted with

their
'how ftrangely thofe decrees have been mifconceived, from '
want. of knowing the hiftory of thofe times and of the mea
againft whom they were ill'ued.-Let us fuppofe for an inftapt.
Philip D'Orleans, in virtue of the oath of allegiance common
in the Feudal Syllem, fummoning all his va1rals to follow him
and unite with his Jacobins in the deftruaion of the throne,
of the laws, of all fociety and of religio~ ; will any man of
fenfe believe·the vaffals to be bound, by their oath, to carry
arms under and to follow Philip's ftandard and thus fec:ond
his antifocial confpiracy? Is it not evident on the contrary,
that no oath can bihd fubjefu to fupport fuch a war, that aU
oaths are null, which can only be fulfille~ by the deftruaion
-of the throne, the annihilation afthe laws, and of the bafis o(
all civil fociety; that in fuch a pofition, it_is the caufc of
the fovcreign, of the laws, and of fociety, that is to be de-
fended in fpite of all oaths ? Well, I ~ill pledge myfelf to
prove that the famous decrees of the Councils of Lateran
againft the ..4/higeDis were no more than a fimilar decilion,
that, fo far from encroaching on the authority of Kings, ther
were itrued in their defence, in' defence of their perfons, .of
their authority, of the laws; and ofcivil fociety ; that had it
not been for thofe decrees both fovereignty and the empire
.of the laws would long Iince hav~ been at an end.
I fbould have numerous errors to combat, and one in par-
-ticular which I fhall not forget. I know there are men {o
much biaffed in favour of the Albigeois and the Vaudois, as
to reprefent them as the anc:eftora of the Anglican Church, in
proof of its .antiquity. Such were the pretenfions of the

In future we may difpenfe with Condor~et's re•

·in their hiftory. We know they had thar oatlu,
their ~gns, their fecret language, their fraternity,
their propaganda, and, above all, ftcrets which 11

What is the moft remarkable is the coincidence
pointed out by Condorcet between the myfteries

gtois). Though the caufe of the Anglican Church is not my
·own, ffill I will ferve it better than all thofe feeble writers.-
/ I will avenge it of the fhame of fuch an origin. I will prove,
·that, fo far from defcending from the Vaudois, they openly_
:condemned their diforganizing principles both before and
after the reign of Henry VIII. and that there never exiftell
the leaft conneaion .between it and the Albigeois~ It is the
exclufive privilege of the Jacobins, and C9ndorcet's fecret
affociations, to defcend from and glory in fuch progenitors.

Such doctrines ·muft naturally have fuffered
many modifications in the Occult Lodges as well
as among the difciples of Manes. He aimed at
the abolition ofaU laws and of Chriftianity, at the
eftablifhment of Liberty and Equality, by means
offuperftitiori and fanaticifm ; our modern Sophif-
~ers were to give his fyft:ems a new direCtion, that
of their impiety. The Altar and the Throne were
equally to be viCtims to them; and Liberty and·
Equality, in oppofition to Kings and to God, were
the laO: myfteries of Manes, as they are of our

Such is the hiftorical fketch of Mafonry, and-
the main point ofits fecrets. Let the reader com-
pare the proofs we have adduced from the very
nature of its degrees, the proofs taken from th~
di.lfertations of the moft learned ~depts ofthe moft
zealous Mafons on their myfteries ; all thofe, in
fine, which we have drawn from their various
opinions on the origin of their alfociation ; and I
do not think he can entertain any doubt as to the
grand object of this inftirution. Let him then re-
flect on the manner in which we were led back by
Condorcet from the Mafons of the day to the flave
Curbicus, and how we ·difcovet in this Herefiarch
and his adepts the real authors of the code and
myfteries of Freemafonry; and I do not appre-
hend that he can any longer entertain adoubt as to '
their firft and real progenitors.
Still it remains for us to fhow how thefe fame
rnyfteries promoted the plans of the Sophifters of
Impiety united with thofe of Rebellion, in the
execution of their plots for effeCting the grand Re-
volution. But let us not terminate this chapter

THE generality of Freemafons o( the prefent
day do the Scotch the honour of looking upon
their Grand Lodge as the frock whence all the
others fprang: It is the~, they tell us, that the
Templars convened for the prefervadon of their

hundred and fixty years ago and frill preferved•in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford. This manufcript is a copy of certain
queftions written about a hundred years before by Henry VI.
in his'own hand. The date then of the original is about three
hundred and thirty years back, as Henry VI. departed this

TaeM are two important remarks to be made on this ma-
nufcript. Firft, that the adept queftioned on t,he origin of
Mafonry makes no mention of the Templars; on the contrary
lae fays, that all the impOrtant fecrets of which it is in pof-
fefJion were bt;ought into Europe by Venetian merchanw
coming from the Eat. (C.mtt(ff.J"Jitff,.,.,,thuJit.JIIII Yt~~ttia

norance, the Mafons might have mitlaken the Venetians for
the Phenicians. Mr. Locke could not have chofen a more
unfavourable moment for his fufpicion, as the Mafons and
·even the Monlu had. by means of the crufades learned to diftin-
g'lilh between the Plltnicia11s and Ymetia•s, and particularly
bet~een Cf'yr and Yl•iu--Nothi.ng was more natural than the
anfwer made by the Mafon to Henry VI. •. That the myfteries
had b~en brought from the Eajl by the Ytwia•s·' All Mafona
agree ~at the Templars learned them in the Eaji. It is very
naturai that the Yenetilllls, fo famous in thofe days for their
co~rce in the Eaft, ihould have .taken thefe myfteries
wh~nce the Templars afterwards d~d, and whofc hitlory had
not yet been incorporated with that of Freemafonry. But
the reader will remark, that every thing leads us back to
·Manes, .to the countries whence, it is well known, the feft and
.its myfteries fpread into Europe.
The fecond obfervation to be made on this ancient Manu-
fcript is, that even in England Freemafonry already c:ompre-

fcribed in Switzerland by the Council of Berne.
From the very nature of their m.yfteries, this
a1fociatio~ could long refift the ftorms by

found the .greateft obftacles to their propagati~n.
England, it is true, difgufted with a Liberty and

for the propagation of its tenets ; it was fome of
thefe who, wifhing to attract, Voltaire into their
party, had made Thiriot write, that notwithftand-
ing the .title of Li/Jerty and Equality given to his

of the Sophifters, removed every difficulty. The
Freemafons, according to cuftom, fought to gain
an afcendancy over the mind of fome man who
might proteCt them againft and averr the indigna•
tion of the Sovereign ; a~d . with the apron they
requeft the. Prince Conti to accept the title of
Grand Mafter of the French Lodges. The Prince
confented to be initiated, and on that occafion the
conftruetion was put upon the myfteries which is
artfully given whenever a candidate is receiv~d,
whofe fentiments, rank, or grandeur, is known to
militate againft the diforganiiing principles o( Li-
berty and Equality. Many Princes and fome
Sovereigns fell into a fimilar error. The Emperor
·Francis I. would.alfo be initiated; and he proteCt-
ed the brethren, who never re,ealed any fecret t()
him which could lhock his known piety. Frede-
ric II. was alfo a Freemafon. The adepts told
him all their fecrets againil: Chrift, ·but guarded
againft the moft diftant hint of applying Liberty

was fo jealous of maintaining.1 ·
In ·fine, the policy of the craft went {o fctr as to
gain prote-Ctors even among the PrinceJfes by ini~

ofthe gratitude ofthe Craft : and under her aufpi·
tes they fpread far and near. But when the Con...
{piracy burft forth at Naples this proteCl:ed bro-
therhood were round to be a neil: ofconfpiring Ja·
cabins. The plot had been contrived in their
Lodges, and the proteCl:ing ~cen ftood foremoft
on the lift ofprofcriptions.
Many Lords and Noblemen, true and accepted
Mafons, had joined in the confpiracy ; but the
Court foon difcovered the occult plot, in which it
had been decided that all the Nobles, though Jaco-
bin Mafons, iliould be maffacred immediately after
the Royal Family by the equal and clouted-1hoed
brethren.
In animadverting 'on thefe faCl:s, of which the
Hiftorians of the Revolution will have to treat
hereafter, my -
defign is to draw the attention. of
my reader to that policy of which fo many great
perfonages have been the miferable dupes. The
Occult Mafons would go in queft of them, and
initiate them in all the myfteries againft religion.-
The initiation ofthefe Noblemen quieted the fear$
and averted the attention of Government from the
Lodges, feeing them fr.equenced bymc::n who were
.the natural allies of the throne. And this policy
ofthe Occult Lodges proved one of the nioft fuc-

cefsful tools for their fuccefs. The names of the
moft faithful fervants of the crown fcreened the -
rebellious plots of their occult myfteries; and that
of Conti eafily quieted Lewis XV. with refpeCl: t<J
the Mafons. The Police .of Paris made no far-
ther enquiries, and the Lodges were tolerated.
The Sophifters and the progreiS of Impiety fur~
nifhed them with new and more efficacious means
ofmultiplying their Lodges.
According as Voltaire and Holbach's club fuc·
ceeded in inundating Europe .with their impious
writings, the Craft extended its conquefts. fr was
then eafy for the· Philofophifts to make themfdves
.be liftentd to by men already difpofed to the.
fecret myfteries by their Antichriftian and Anti-
monarchical publications, and to infpire them with
a defire of a new order of things to be learned in
their Lodges. Curiofity, ftimulated by impiety,
daily made new converts to the fetl:. Impiety
continued propagated and fpread wide the fpirit
and fafhion ofMafonry, and that was the great fer-
vice rendered to it by the Sophifters ofthe age.
On their fide, the Sophifters oflmpiety andRe-

After having taken the oath, the fecret which
flattered him the moft to learn was, that the

his moft zealous difciples. That their fecret con-
f!fted in tft.at Liberty and Equality which he had
himfdf-oppofed to the Gofpel of his God and to
the pretended Tyrants of the Earth. The Lodge
refounded with fuch applaufe, the adepts rendered
him fuch honours, and he fo perfeCtly felt the caufe
of them, that, thinking_ his pride gratified and his
vow of hatred accomplifhed, .he blafphemoufly
·@xclaimed, '!'his triumph is well worth that of the

It was not fufficient for the heroes ofthe Ency-
dopedia to unite under their ftandards againft
C.hrift the infidels of the court and of every clafs.
Many in all daffes who had remained faithful to
their God were alfo true to their King. Even
in the impious part of the Arifrocracy many men·
were to be found, whom fortune, ambition, or
cuftom attached either to the perfon or to the

neral intereft of th~ craft. Thofe Lodges that
were not under the infpeffion of the Grand Orient,
were under a fimilar government of a Mother
Lodge, which alfo had its Grand Mailer and kept
the fame fort of correfpondence.
This part of their conftitutions was generally
known to' all the brethren ; but I have often re-
peated that with refpea to the Occult Lodges they
were in the dark. The day was to come whe.l)
the greateft novice in the art was to ihow as much
zeal as the moft profound adept. To effectuate
this, it was only neceffary to fill their ordinary
Lodges with hair-brained young fell~ws, ignorant
citizens, and even thick-headed workmen, who
had been previou1ly mi1led by the impious doc-
trines of the Sophifters, and with all thofe who
were carried away by that torrent of declamation,
calumnies, &c. direaed againft the altar, the
throne, and all the higher orders of fociety.
With filch a fpecies of brethren the Occult
Myfteries were unneceffary, and without any fur- .
ther inftrud:ions the warhoop of Liberty and Equa-
lity was more than fufficient to excite their enthu-
fiafm and dirett their blows. A chief in each
Lodge, or a very few adepts in direa correfpon-

might eafily be informed of the day and hour on

tionaey fury, and to point out the.objeCts and per-

was it impoffible to organi~e thofe bands of Bri-
gands and firebrands into Lodges, and thus diftri.-
bute to each the different parts oflevelling butchers
and of revolutionary executioners. Thefe Lodges,
multiplied throughout the ftate in the towns and
villages, might, under the dire&ion of the central
office or committee., turn out at the fame inftant
all over the country, thoufands -and tens of thou-
fands of adepts all enthufiaftically' arrayed under
.the banners of Liberty and Equality, armed with
pikes, hatchets, and torches, carrying fire and de..
folation wherever their courfe was traced, know-
ing beforehand what victims were to be facrificed,
what caftles and country houfes to be burnt, and
what heads to be ·carried before the triumphant
levellers of Liberty .and Equality ; thus preferv-
ing the moft exaCt accord in the midft of rebel-
lion, levelling at one blow all public force, all
.publicjuftice, diforganizing every thing and throw--
ing every thing into confufion. But, in order to
eft&lbli{h its new empire and organize its own
power, it only had to transform its fecret dens of
confpiracy into Jacobin clubs~ and its grand adepts
into municipal officers. Thus at length, it gave
birth to a Revolution irrefiitible, confummated,.

In thus defcribing what might have been done
by means of that tenebrous fecrecy ofthe Ma-
fonic government and· Lodges, I have only anti~
'.cipated what really was ,done by the Sophifters to
effectuate the French Revolution. As early as
~epufities the ye~r 1776 the central Committee of the
1ent rom ·
the Grand Orient inftruCl:ed the directing adepts· to
g~~;'/r. prepare the Brethren for infurreCl:ion, and to vifit
the Lodges throughout France, to conjure them
by the Mafonic oath, and to announce that th~
time was at length come to accomplifu it in th¢
death of tyrants.
The adept who was· intrufted with the vilitation
of the Nortbern provinces was an officer of artil·
lety called Sinetty. His Revolutionary Apoftle•
fhip led him to Lille. The regiment of La Sarre
was at that time in garrifon there. The Confpi-
rators wifhed particularly to gain profelytes among
and make fure .of the military brethren; Sinetty
was far from fucce.eding according to his wifhes ;
but the method and plans he adopted are all that
can be necelfary for our object. To explain this
matter to our readers, we will lay before them tho
relation made by one of the officers of La Sarre»

When I had determined on publifuing this fact,

aot afraid of being contradicted by them, either
as to the miffion or the manner in which Sinetty

their attachment to their King which milled them
with refpeet to this defigning madman. So far
were · they from any' revolutionary ideas; fo well

terwards lived with the Jacobins, and pryed into

learned Foreigner and a Phyficiah were qualities
which rendered him lefs fufpicious, and he was

For the honour of this unfortunate Duke, we
haften to fay, that the Revolutions foon reclaimed
him from his errors. He had made himfelf Grand
Mafter of feveral Lodges, and was the tool of
Syeyes and Condorcet, who made ufe of his riches

It is thus that many new degrees had been added
to Mafonry, and even a new fociety, which the
reft1efs enthufiafm of the Sophifters of Impiety
had invented to fprea.d the ancient fyftems of dif-
organizing Liberty and Equality, and to enfure
their triumph. It was to the Propaganda that they
were indebted for the immenfe number of their
adepts; or rather, in rendering i~piety fo com-
mon, the fpirit of Philofophifm had gained fo
much ground, that it was fcarcely neceffary to be
initiated into the Occult myfteries to be a complete
confpirator.
At that time few novices were to be found either
in the Grand Lodges of the Orient or of the Con-
trat ~ocial. The Revolution,was fo openly carried
, -on there, that the Court could not be ignorant of
it. Among the number, it was impoffible that
fome .fhould not look upon the Revolution as a

This Minifter was ~or a 'man who could be
fufpeaed of having,in any degree tampered in the

£himerical even to furmife a plan ofoverthrowing

was little to be feared.

De Maurepas, whofe inatl:ive and carelefs difpo-

might become fttfpicious by their daily meetings,

.Equality and Liberty, the grand fetret of their

to wreft from their unfortunate Monarch~ In a
word, they wifhed for fuch a King as the firft
Jacobin LegiOators dreamt of, a King whom
they could domineer over, and who had no autho-

Liberty in the grandees or wealthy, counterpoifed
by an Equality of Liberty in the plebeians, and

themfelves guiltlefs rebels becaufe they were· not
fufficiently powerful to dirett the courfe of the re-

It was in this view that Briffot, Condorcet, add
Syeyes propofed to form a general union of all the
adepts, whatever might be their Revolutionary
Syftems, under the title of Friends ofthe Blacks,
it was .even agreed, that every man who had any
ferious. caufe of complaint againft the court fhould
be invited to join them. This w~ the reafon why
they invited the Marquis de Beaupoil de St• .Aulair8,
whom they fuppofed to be imbued with their'
pri~ciples through defire of revenge. But they
were grofsly miftaken. The Marquis had great
reafon to complain of the, Miniftry; but no, one·

not his high repute for honefty that acquired him ·
his feat in this committee, but the wild enthufiafm

very providently refigned his place to Gairaux•.

the Mafonic Central Committee, was punifbed for it by him
to whom he delivered it over. At the firft dawn of theRe.
volution he was thrown into prifon as an Ariftocrate. Orders'
were fent for his delivery. The mafter, now become 'a Muni-
cipal Officer, changed the order for that of letting him walk
upon a very high terrace. At the fame time o_n:lers were

THERE fometimes appear men formed with Spartac~
fuch unhappy difpofitions, that we are led to con- ~:if;.
fidet them in no other view than as emanations. P
from the evil genius, bereft by the avenging God
of the povter of'doing good. Imbecil in the fphere,
of wifdom, fuch men are only efficient in the artl
of vice and deftruttion; they are ingenious in thofe·
conceptions, fkilful in that cunning, and fruitful in
thofe refources which enable them defpotically tet
reign in the ·fchools offalfehood, depravity, and
wickednefs. In competition with the Sophifters, -
tltefe men will furpafs them in the arts ofexhibiting
error in falfe and delufive colours; of difguifing.

With fuch qualities,- and under fuch aufpices,

WEISHAUPT, better ·known in the annals of the

of Saxe Gotha, enjoys an afylu~, receives a pen-

the tide of Honorary Counfellor to that Prince.
An odious phenomenon in nature, an Atheift
void of remorfe, a profound hypocrite, deftitute
of thofe fuperior talents which lead to the vindi-
cation of truth, he is poffeffed of all that energy
and ardour in ·vice which generates confpirators

thus that by the moft abominable hypocrify he

So much for the moral virtue ofthis man ; but
our chief objetl: is, to confider him in his charatler
of a Confp\rator. Let us then ddcend into that
baleful abyfs, and obferve him in the fchools of
impiety, rebellion, and anarchy. Here again he
appears to have been ignorant of the gradations of
crime, of the ipace that lies between the flighteft
· dc;yiation from red:itude and the mofl: profound
-wickednefs. Here, fcarcely have the magiftrates
caft their eyes upon him when they find him at
the head of a confpiracy which, when compared
with thofe of the clubs ef Voltaire and D'Alem-
bert, or with the fecret committees of D'Orleans,
make thefe latter .appear like the faint imitations
of puerility, and fuow the Sophift~r and the Bri-

." Thcfe '(as Weifhaupt writes) may fometiritea
be.tbe moft im!Jetile, and at other times the moft ·
ingeruous of the Brotherhood.'' From the for-
mer he can depend on a blind obedie~ce to the
rules he lays down, which are never to be deviated
from; and with refpeel: to the latter,· provided
they be f.ealous and punCl:uai, fhould they even
tr~fgrefs any ofthe laws, it would not be in fuch
a manner as to commit either their own fafety or
that of'the Order; arid they would foon make

In order to judge of the qualifications of the

to begin by procuring tablets, which he is to

whofe education had been but little atte-nded to.
We may obferve W eifhaupt confuking with hia
confidant Zwack on this part of the code ; but
whether it was never digefted,.or that he f~w the
Infinuators could eafily fupply the defect, no fur-
ther mention is made of the third method. Let
\ us then examine the effence of the firft two.
To exemplify the firft method, let us fuppofe
i one of thofe men who have .gone through a f;.Om-
plete courfe ofmodem -Philofophifm, who, fhould
they not fcoff at ChriftiaAity, woulq at leaft ~efi-
. tate at every thing which is called religion; for ·
' the code forewarns the Infinuator, that his efforts
, would be vain fhould he attempt to feduce Philo-
; fophers of another ftamp, men of found judg-
1 ment, and who would never be partizans of doc-
; trines which could not endure the light of broad
1 day. But when he fhall hav~ ' difcovered oneol

~f antiquity. He will have little diflic:ulty in acc-
ingfu~h a·part, as he will find ample inU:ruttions
in the code. To follow thofe inftrucHons faith-
fully, he muft begin " by defca_
nting on the fu-
" preme felicity of being verfed in fciences whicb.
" few can approach, of walking in the paths of
cc light while the vulgar are groping in darknefs.
" He myft remark, that there exift doctrine•
'·' folely tranfmitted by fecret traditions, becaute
" they are above the comprehenfion of common
" minds. In proof. of his aifertions he will cite
" the Gymnofophifts i~ the Indies, the Priefts of
" lfis in Egypt, and•·thofe of Eleufis and the
" Pythagorean fchool in Greece." He will fe..
_leB: cettain, fentences from Cicero, Seneca, Arifti-
des, and lfocrates ; and, left he fhould ever be taken
unawares, he will learn thofe by heart which the
legiflator has carefully inferted in the code.
Though it would be very eafy to demonftrate from
thofe very authors, that the ancient myfteries:laid
down no fixed principles. on the important pointa

1hould the candidate wifh it, he would do his heft
to procure him the fame felicity ; but that it was
a fcience gradually imparted, and that cer.tain men
poffeffed the talent ofguiding him from a diftance,
Qf leading him to the difcovery of this new world,
and that without being ever in his prefence •.
When the In.finuator has by fuch language fuc·
:ceeded in exciting the curiofity of his candidate,
he muft then afcertain .his opinions on fome par-
ticular articles. He will propofe the difcuffion of
certain queftions in writing, and of certain prin-
ciples, as the .groundwork on which they are in.
future to proceed. The code does not determine
what .thefe queftions are to be, becaufe they vai'J
:according to the political and religious difpofitiona
which the Jnfinuator may have obferved in the
candidate. Should thefe differtations noway agree
with the principles of the feet:, th..t.Jnfinuator will

thofe who were not eighteen years of age; two
years for thofe between eighteen_and twenty-four;
and one year for thofe who were near thirty •.
Circumftances have fince occafionally caufed the
· time to be abridged ; but, whatever may be the
difpofitions of the Novice,·though the rime may
be difpenfed with, he muft go through the diffe-

he is admitted into the other degrees. During
this interval he has no other fuperior but the lnfi-
nuator to whom he is indebted for his vocation;
and during th~ whole time of the noviciate, the
Infinuator is exprefsly forbidden to inform his
pupil of any other member of the order. Thi•
law was made to fkreen the order from the dangers

ved it for the Mat~
King. Let us feparately inveftigate each of thefe
degrees, commencing with ·that principle which he
himfelf Jays down, and from which he never de-
viates, that each degree 1hall be a preparatory
concatenation of principles and doctrines, the ulti-
mate tendency of which \vas to form the objett of
the laft myfteries. Such a principle is more than
fufficient to demonftrate that the fecret to be im·
parted to his Mages can be no other than the
moft abfolute Atheifm, and the total fubvcrfi011
of every Religion. The adept, however, has
already imbibed fuch horrid principles ; and the
fecret confifts in telling him, in plain terms, .that
it was tow~ that point the ·Sed had long fince
been leading him, and that in future all his
thoughts, words, and attions, muft tend to fecond
the views of the Sed: in their monftrous under-
taking; that in the preceding degrees the name of
Religion had only been preferved the better to
defl:roy the thing ; but thtt in furore the very name
would only be the expreffi~n of chimeras, of
fuperftition, of fanaticifm, fupported by defpo-
tifm and ambition, as· a tool for enllaving man-
kind.

they are referved for thefe laft tllyfteries. As a
preparation for them (borribile diffu !) the very
idea of a God muft be eradicated from the mind
ofthe adept. Can we doubt of this, when we fee

at leaft we have a right to judge him and his myf-

new light. He is not only the confpiring infidel,
but the infolent Sophifter, infulting the public

In the eourfe of his inftruaions, the reader is
not to expea that Weithaupt will make any e][P
ception in favour of the revealed Religion, not
even a hint at fuch an exctption is to be feen.-
The Religion of Chrift is rcprefented as a medley
of the reveries of Pythagoras, of Plato, and of
, Judaifm. It is in vain for the Ifraelites to believe
in the Unity ofGod, in the coming of a Meffiah;
it is in vain to a1fert that fuch was the faith of
their forefathers, of Abraham, lfaac, and Jacob,
long before they entered Egypt ·or Babylon ; it is
in vain to prove, that the adoration of the golden
Calf, or of the god Apis, was punifhed by the
Almighty as a prevarication of their Religion :
Nothing will ferve the ·sophifter; he will declare
in his eorretled eode, that the Religion of the Jews
was but a modification of the reveries of the
E~yptians, of Zoroafter, or of the Babylonians.
To eorretl his adepts, he teaches them to caft afidc
the Creation as a chimera unknown to antiquity,
and to reduce all Religion to two Syftems-The
one, that ofmatter.co-eterna1 with God, a part of

rattd from God, in order to become the world-
.The other, matter co-eternal with God, without
being God, but .worked by God, for the forma-
tion of the univerfe. On thefe foundations he
builds a general hiftory of all Religions, and
makt":s all appear equally abfurd. The reader
might be tempted to think that thefe ldfons had
been compofed before the hegira or rather pro-
. fcription of the author of Dluminifm. They may
have been compiled for one of thofe difcourfes
which he declares to be of more importance chan
that of the Hierophant in the degree of Epopt.-
He precifely follows the courfe which Knigge re-
prefenrs as the grand object of the laft myfteries.
He makes, after his fa!hion, a general compila-
tion of all the fchools of Philofophifm and of its
Syftems; and hence he deduces Chriftianity and
all Religions. The rc:fult of the whole is, that
all Religions are founded on impgfture and chi-
mera, all end in rendering man cowardly, lazy,
cringing, and Juperflitious s all degrade him, and
trouble:: his repofe •. And · it is thus that this

phant .fpeaks of Abraham and of the patriarchs,
of the father prieft IJifd Icing, fole f0'1Jtrtign over
his family. ·He is not to expea to fee the father .
furrounded by his children, exerciting the fweeteft
of all dominions, and each child, docile to the
diCtates of nature, revering the orders and antici~
pating the will of a beloved father. No; this
empire i$· as imaginary as his .priefthood. We
have feen in the degree of Mage, that the illu-
minized patriarch can ·no more pretend to the
acknowledgement of a God than can an Atheift..
We· muft then begin by withdrawing from the
patriarchal life that interefting fight of the father
offering up to heaveri the prayers of his children,
facrificing in their name, and exercifing in the
midft of them the funCtions · of the· prieft of
the living .God. In the next degree of the

"to difappear, as his priefthood has already done.

is the patriarchal fovereign to expeCt any more

to blafpheme the love o/ one's family even frill
more than tbe national love, or tbt love of one's
tountry, as being the more direCt and immediate
principle of the mpfl: difaftrous Ego!fm. ·Let- the

ppenly reft.ft his patriarchal power as foon as

in the fciences to which they had devoted them-

The grand objeCt of this inftitution is to infpire
the pupils with the greateft confidence in the
Order, from an idea that it will furnifh them
with all the means .and lights neceff.ary for the
profecution of the ftudy they have adopted. The·
Infinuators have held out the promife to them,.
and the Order has engaged to fulfil it. This
idea of a fcientific fociety, and of which thet
have the honour of being members, is to encou-
rage in them a docility and veneration for their
chiefs naturally due to men whofe precepts ~ppear
to be emanations of light and of the moft tranf-
cendent wifdom. The artifice in fome fort an-
fwers to the promife.
Every Novice, on being admitted into the Mi-
nerva! fchools, was to begin by declaring to what
art or fdence he meant t<> devote himfelf, unlefs
indeed his pocket was to be affelfed for the taX
which his genius could not pay. This decla-
ration is trarifmitted from the inferior lodges to
the Provincial, who forwards it to the Dean; by
whom notice of it is given to the Epopt who
prefides over that particular branch of fcience ;
and he infcribes his name on the lift of thofe
pupils whofe labours fall under hit infpeetion. ·

cautions, the Epopt 1hould find himfelf unpre-
pared or unable to folve the difficulty propofed,
}le will apply to the Dean, who will fend the
required folution or have recourfe to die Pro-
vincial. , But, left the Superiors 1hould find their
occupations too often interrupted by fuch appli-
cations, it is exprefsly enjoined to the Epopt, not
' to have recourfe to them but in cafes of abfolute

negligence.- It may fo happen, that the Pro-
vincial is not able to give the req1,1ired folution '
he will then propofe it to all the Epopts of his

IN the general plan of the Government of the
Dluminees it is faid, that every Brother lhall re-
ceive particular inftruaions according:to the rank
he holds in the Hierarchy of the Order: Yet I
have never been able ·to difcover thofe intended
for the ufe ofthe National DireC\:ors. This part
of the Code is not to be found either in the twe
volumes fo often quoted of the Original Writings,
or in that of Philo and Sparta&IIS which has thrown
fo much light on the myfteries. It does not ap-
pear, that any of the German writers who have
been the beft informed on, and the moft ftrenuous
opponents of, Dluminifm have ever been abk co
difcover them. For fome time I even entertain-
ed doubts whether the Superiors called Nati1111Jl
Diretlors, and thofe ftyled 111jpet1ors, were not of
the fame degree in the Hierarchy of the Sett.-
They were certainly diftinet employments in the
year 1782.; fo~ WeHhaupt•s letters at that period

neral account w~ch the Order puts into the hands
of its Regents, and the laft works ofPhilo printed
in 1788, mention no intermediate office between·
the Prfl'l)incials and the NRJionals, which latter are
fometimes defcribed as NRJional Sxperiors, at
others as National l".fpetlors. Their correfpon-
dence and fubordination is dire6t from the Su-
preme Council t· It is therefore evident, that in
the laft digcft ofthe Code the two offices of Na- ·
ti01141 Injpellor tmd Diretlor were united. But in
vain would the Sect conceal the inftructions which
it has appropriated to the functions of thefe Na.. .
JjqnaJ Superiors. The denomination alone tefti-
fies the importance which attaches to their officei
and ifthe precife nature of their duties be want•
ing, it is eafy to fupply the deficiency, by ~hat
has already efcaped the vigilance of the Sea in the
.foregoing parts of the Code.
Let the reader recall to h~ mind what has been
faid in the Chapter on the Epopts, of the fyftems
which they were to form in order to feize on the
empire of the Sciences and direCl: them all toward
the accompli£hment of the plots ofthe Sect. In

I do n~t forget that l am to treat of the N11tiona!
Direflors ; but am fomewhat afraid that my rea-
ders may adduce this plan for giving a new reli-
gion to the whole oniverfe, as invalidating their
plot for the deftrud:ion of every religion. · Let
fuch readers, however, reflea on the r~ligidfl
whic!h Weifbaupt has himfelf laid down for his
Mages. It is the rankeft Spinofifm, admitting oft
no God but the world itfelf; that is to fay, abfo-
lute Atheifm. Let them alfo remember, that one
of the laft fecrets of the Grand Myfteries, is to
reveal to the adepts that all religions are grounded
on and are the inveation of impoflqre. Nor is it
by any means difllculc co account for thefe two
fchemes ofthe Secl:, the one for the creation of a.
new religion, the other for the deftrutl::i?n of all.
Thefe plans are to be fucceffive in their opera-
tions. Sentiments of Religion are too deeply en- .
graven in.the minds of the people for Weifhaupt
to flatter himfe.lf with fuddenly eradicating it, or
at leaft .without fubftituting fome capricious and
fophifticated faith, which in reality would no more
conftitute a religiou than the Worjhip ofReaftn, of
which th'e French Revolution has given us an im-
pure elfay. The n·ligion, therefore, to be in-
vented by the Maget.' of Illuminifm is no more
than a preparatory fkp that fhould deftroy the
rdigion of Chrifr throughout the.univerfe. This
advantage gained, it will ;-emain no very difficult

inanity and impolture of their own ; and thus it
will have ferved as a fcaffol<ing which naturally
difappears with the edifice that is to be pulled
down. This religion to be iuvented may be con-.
fidered as on a parallel with: thofe new govern-
ments, thofe democracies, wlich are to amufe the
p:ople until the period 1hafl .come when their
illuminizing Equalityand Lib.erty 1hall have taught
them. that each one is effentially his own fovereign,
that this fovereignty is an imprefcriptible right
inherent in each man, in dirc.~a: oppofition to de·
mocracy,and even to all propertyor focial compaa.
Such is the general tenour of the fyftems to be
invented .and profecuted by the Sea, for attaining
the grand object of thefe confpirators. All the
.adepts which the SeCt comprites under the deno-
mination of Jpeculative· geniujes are perpetually
labouring at thefe fyftems under the direCtion of
the Provincials. But they are ·,,ot the perfons
who complete the plans ; they arr.= only to prefent
the firft fketch, which each Prc,vincial is obliged
to tranfmit to the National Diri:Ciory, there to.un-
dergo a further inveftigation f.nd receive its final

does not confine its views to one nation. It h~
formed within itfelf a fupreme tribunal, which .
has fubjeCted all nations to its inquifition. Com-
pofed of twelve Peers ofthe Order•, it is prefided
over by the General ; and. under the name of
Areopagites, it. becomes the Common centre of
communication from the adepts of all nations,
as the Naticnal is the centre of one particular
-nation, the Provi11cial of one province, the Local
Superior of the lodges of his diftrict, the Mintl"tJal
Mafter of his academy, the Venerable of his Ma-
fonic lodge ; and, finally, as the Jnfinuator or
Recruiter is of his novices or candidates. Thus,
from the firft fiep to the pinnacle of the Order,
every thing is connected and gradually afcends by
means of the f.tuibus Licets, Solis and Primos.-
Every thing that happens in each nation gradually
afcends to the Nati~nal, and from thefe Diretlors
all is tranfmitted to the centre of all nations, to
the fupreme council of the Areopagites, and the
General .in chief, the univerfal DireCtor of the
Confpiracy.
The grand point, therefore, to be pbferved in
the code concerning the National Director is, his
direCt correfpondence with the Areopagites. It is

of this Supreme Council of the SeC\: I It is in

for rendering the diforganizing fyftems of Liberty
and Equality familiar to the illuminizing adepts:
There is exatl:ly afcertained the proportion which
each clafs of the brethren can bear in this uni-
verfal deftruB:ion of religion, empire, fociety, and
property ; there again is the day anxioutly fought
and the means prepared, for hereafter throwing
ofF the mafk, and attacking perjona/ly the de-
fenders of religion, laws, and property, as fo
many enemies to reafon and humanity; there con-
centrate all the declarations, the reports, the plans
of all the brethren difperfed throughout the uni-
verfe, that the SeCt mayjudge of its own ftrength,
and compare it with that of the friends to the
Altar and the Laws. To fum up all, it is there
that the artifices and means are determined on.,

Jaim repeat all thofe circwnilancea oa which Paris and the
whole ~rld weri at that .time full of converfation, refpefHng
dae Mrrid ftate of this impio111 man's foul at the approach ot
death. Mr. Tronchin (e'ten as phyician) did every thing in.
.lais power to calm him ; for the agi~tion he was in was f~
violent, thf.t no remedies could take eif'etl. Sut he could not
fucceed.; and, unable to tndure the horror he felt at the pecu-
liAr nature of his frantic rage, he abandoned him.
. .. So violent a ftate inan exhaufted frame could not be oflong
duration. Stupor, the forerunner ofdiJrolution, muft naturally
fucceed, as it generally does after any violent agitatiOJls ge.
.Derated by pain ; and it is this latter ftate which in Voltaire
has been decorated by the appellation ofcalm. Mr. Tronch~
wilhed to difcredit this error-; and with that laudable view, as
110 eye witnefs, he immediately publilhed in aU companies the
reaVafu, and precifely as you h~ve ftated them. This he did
to furnilb a dreadful lefiOn to thofe who c~lculate on being
able in a death-bell to inveftigate the difpofitiona moil: proper
Co appear in before the judgement-feat of the Aimighty. At
that period, not only the bte of the body, but the COJ!dition
of the foul, may fruftrate their hopes of making fo awful &D
inveftigation ; for jujiice and fanfiity as well as goodnefa are
attributes of God; and he fometimea, as a wholefome admo·
oition to mankind;permits' the punifhments denounced agailift
the impious man to begin even in this life by the tortW'es of

« But this inaccuracy refpefHng the death of Voltaire ia
not the only one with which the aforenamed autltor might be

In the Second Volume, there--is a pafiage of a dUFerent

far better grounded. It relates to Mr. Sinetty's arrival at

by what miftake he was faid 'to be an officer nf ~valry, whm
in reality-he was an'officer o( infantry. As to thefllll rtlattJ,
it is of little importance In which he ferved; but the miftakc
:might inculpate two other o.fficers of the fame name who
ferved in the cavalry, and whofe loyalty and attachmelit
to their King could never be atreaed by the Jacobin M.ifion-
,ary bearing ' the fame name. This miflake, however, has
given rife to much ~efearth. Mr. Le Comte de Martange,

Certainly the Jacobins would not be forry to fee fuch an

faying to Kings, if we attack your thrones you may ·thank

th~n the efforts of a Bri~ot or a Syeyes, that dethroned
Lewis XVI. ; it was more owing to you than to Petion or
Robefpierre that he was led to the fcafi-old; and, above: .all,
it was the tyranny of Lewis XVI. that engraved in our hearts
· that wilh to exterminate every King on earth-Dr. Griffiths.
alfo finds it more convenient peremptorily to pronounce on
.the validity of the proofs which I adduce, than to fubmit any
of them.to his readers, left they lhould draw a very·different
~onclulion. Not a word does he mention of the Letters, of
the Syftems, of Holbach!s Club, of the Central Committee,
of,the EmUfaries of the Grand Orient, of the DeclaJllations
and formal a1·owals of the adepts Le Roi, Condorcet, G~din,
at1d his fellow~revie'!Yers of the Mercure. All this m!lft lead:
us to believe, that Dr. Griffiths is difficult of conviction when
he pleafes to be fo ; and that he can withhold proofs when he
is. not in a humour to refute them. So many perfons will
take the word of their teachers for granted, that it is unne-
c:efuy for ·h.im to condefcend to give his reafons. We fhall
fee.. whether he will4eign to notice Sir Horace Walpole, who
{o long fince denounced the CQnfpiracy of the Sophiftus of
Rebellion. IfDr. Griffiths be determined to be blind, I can-
not pretend to.ma~e him fee.
zdly, Dr. Gr~s alfo declares, that my polition "is
wholly erroneow,"when I fay, that Equality a4tl Lihertyform

tempted to recognize a brother dupe ; but he had his reafons

but, without pretending to fay whether you are initiated in
.the fecrets of lUuminifm or not, this much I can alrert, that
no IIJ.uminee could have· fhawn lefs candour than has the au·
'thof of the article t'o which I am about to reply.
Sofar was I from attributing any other intention to Weif-
.ha.upt, ·than that which he really had, when he wrote thefe
:word.;. 'Au& tim jlaat111 trllten wir in 11eut kluger gewQ/Jiu,

Sophitler was endeavouring to lead us back to the favage ftate?
I fhould fpare the Reviewer too much, or fhould rather hold
·him out ·as an Ignoramus, were I to fay that he could hav~
been miftaken as to the meaning of that fentence. Here it

condefcend to favour me with the interview I requelled, that
I might fitow him the· German text, I here print it, that he
may get it tranfiated by whom and where he pleafes; and I
defy him to iliow that I have either altered or warped the
fenfe of that paffage : " Die natur hat das menfchen

that Nature has drawn us, and to which it is leading us back:
by means of his (fecret) affodations, is not the favage Jlate.
Befide, he adds, utus explain this 11tJJiety; and how does he
do this 1 why, by dedicating more than forty pages to prove.
that the object of Nature in Secrll Societies is·to eradicate

Xll OBSERVATIONS, &c.
Bonne, meditating and combining among themfelves the
means of propagating this fable in Germany, juft u Dr.
Griffiths had done in England. We can produce the letter of
the adept Brtm11er to Nimis, difcovered among the papers of
Bla. and fent by the officers who had feized .them to the Bi..
jhop of Spire. Dr. Griffiths knows many things concerning
Mafonry and Illuminifm ; but he may probably be unac:
quainted with this letter; it would not be right that he lliould
continue ·fo, as he will by the information be better able to
judge of the part that he is adiog, and of the fervic:es that
he is rendering to Illwninifm.
Thisdifpatchis dated June 9• 1792, that is, juftaboutthe
time when the coalition of the crowned heads. feemed to
menace Jacobinifm with immediate deftrudion. The adepts
are much occupied with inventing a plan for remodelling 11-
luminifm, that it might acquire new vigor. In ,this plan a
cloak is fought, which, hiding the grand machine, leaves its
·inftruments at liberty to. aa without being feen, .and to at-
tain the objea of the Sea without being 'fufpe&d of med-
dling with Illuminifm. .
The cloak that was thus to favour the views of the breth-
·ren, was an J!_cainny of Scienus formed of two clafres of.mc:n,
the one of men remarkable for their zeal in.the .c:aufe :of. re-
ligion, the other of profound llluminees. Honorary members
were. to be eletled as protedors; and if (fays the authQr of
the plan) DA LanT once gtts Jo his gfJ<IItrnllltnt (that is, if.the

Pray, Dr. Griffiths, has this plan come to your know-
ledge? Now lillen to what the adept author of the plan
fays : « But if people cry out againft hidden Jtjuitifm and
" againft the progrtjs of Catholicifm, it will be fo much the
" better. That would the better do away all fufpicion of a·
•• fecret affociation; one might (and this is worthy of Dr.
" Griffiths's obfervation) one's ft!f btl; to fpread this fa!Ji
•• alarm.,. I here add the text, for the benefit of a tranf-
lation from Dr. Griffiths, which if he gives, I hope he will
a)fo add the text, that the public may pronounce on tbe
treacherous ingenuity: « Wurde iiber heimlichen Jefuitifm,
u' oder iiber grofere aufbreitung des Katholicifm• gefchrien,
., defto beffer; dadurch wiirde aller verdacht einer geheimen
.. verbiodung nur um fo mehr befeitiget. Man konte fogar
" diefen blinden !arm felbft fchlagen b~lfen." When, Sir,
yon fuall have duly meditated on this plan of the adepts,
I ihould like to know what you could have done more to
favor their-views than you did in giving an ~count of Mr.
Robifon's work, of my work, and of the miferable produaion
calling itfe)f A.fir:ft Lemr of a Free-majo11 to the .l!hhi Barr11el.

there bas been no farther queftion of llluminifm in Ger-

whofe tendency well deferved the attention· of the public._:.
When I accufe the SeCl: of aiming at the witdeft anarch.y,
I fhow that this rnyftery was referved to the· profound adepts
and chiefs, though their fecret at prefent frequently efupes
them before a public audience. Generally. Sir, they make
the fame avowals as you do. They are pleafed to hea-r it faid
that Voltaire, and thofe men whom they denominate gt'lllt
philo.fophers, confpired againtt Chriffianity; and t.hat other
{elf-created philofophers of the Lodges confpired agaiaft
kings. This might contribute to make nations believe· that
it
D1g1tlzed by Coogle
OBSER.VATlONS, &c.
it is not {o very criminal a thing to engage ia fuc:h confpi·
racies. But it is a more difficult thing to invent a plautible
pme¥t for confpiring againft all property and civil fociety i
and for that reafon more care is taken to conceal the ultimate
views of their plots. Meanwhile, llowever, they cry down
every author that dares to unma1k thefe hideous confpirators.
Was it under an illution, 4)f wittingly, that you followed fo
nearry the fame method in reviewing the works of Mr. Ro-
bifon and myfelf? Do not expea a decmoa froiP me. My
objea is, that the pnlie fhoutd not be milled to believe that
I hue exaggerated the myfteries of the Illuminees. I leave
1:0 that fame public to Judge whether any of the Reviewers
are dupes or accomplices.

When public report fpread the news in Ger-

a party for himfelf agairift thofc fathers who after

than Weifhaupt.
·Apparently tranquil at Ingolftadt, Weifhaupt
had a far better ·cloak for his confpiracies than
Sejanus's idlenefs. A feeming affiduity in his
duty, a great fhow of zeal and erudition in his
expounding of the laws~ eaftly mifled p~ople te>-
believe that his whole time and talents were en-
gtotfed with the ftudy of them J and; if "'e are
to· credit .his own account, Ingollladt had ~ever
witneffed a profeffor fo well calculated to add
new luftre to its.univerfity•. The public fun6ti9_ns,
of profetror of the laws, and the fecr~t arts of
feducer in private, had not made· hlm forget that
he was alfo the founder of Illuminifm, and that in.
this latter quality he had to form .a code .of Iaws,
which were at'once to annihilate-every other law,
all religion, and ill property. · At the time when.
he initiated his firft adepts, he was far from having
perfected that. code of iniquity; and perhaps .in,
the ftritl: ·fenfe of the word Weifhaupt had devi-
ated from the common rules of prudence, in giv..
ing way to fuch ardour for the propagation of .the
Order, fending his apoftles and initiating his dif-
ciples before he had completed the code of laws
which was to regulate their conduCt.- But ·fuch•
an impetuofity cannot be confidered in this proto;;

fyftem of initiations anc:l of trials which his Novices
were to undergo ; and artfully to prepare thofe
· impious and fophifticatcd difcourfes to be pro-
nounced by his Hierophants ; in a word, to com-
plete that concatenation of artifice which was to
regulate the conduCt ofhis Regents, DireCtors, and
Areopagites. He could nQt endure the idea of
facrificing fo many years to mere theoretic pro-
jeCts. He would, in his firft effays, make con-
quells that were to enfure him ftill greater ones on
a future day, which he had ·already calculated.
He knew his own ·talents too well to entertain
the Ieaft doubt o( fuccefs ; he forefaw how far he
could perfeCt thofe fyftems which he had as yet
only conceived, and he wifhed to have ready at

ceive his new gofpel, and apofi:les who Jhould need
only to be initiated in his taft myftefies, when his
code, completed, was to be fent to the tenebrous

the confidant and bofom friend of Spar/acus, and
was confeqlJendy initiated in aU the myfteries of

of a Novice with his Infinuator. He was not only
at that time a member of the CoUege of Areo-
pagites, but a]fo the fuperior of it, and in a per-
petual and direct correfpondence with Wei1haupt.
He acted his part fo well, that Ajax, ftill confider•
ing him as his fcholar, thought to do him a great
favour in fhowing him a few of Weifhaupt's let-
ters ; but they had already paffed through the
fcholars' hands,.as did every writing coming from
Sparlacus to Ajax.
This part which Zwack afled, of infpeeting
him who thought himfelf his infpeetor, explains
that apparent contradiCtion between the tablets
written by Ajt»e and the lift of the firft adepts,
which is 'o be feen in th~ Original Writings t•

no fooner was SptJrtacus made acquainted with Ms

The Jefuits at leaft ftrongJy fufpected the Count

thofe· to whom they were indebted for the lofs of
a penfion ·of ten thoufand florins, which had al-
ways been paid to them by the Court of Bavaria.
How far thefe fufpicions are grounded I do not

Senfeim appears on the lift of.adepts under the
tharatteriftic of King .Alfred. But without our

ferves for its own ufe out of all the emoluments
which it has procured for it5 adepts either in

But in this fame note an enigma occurs of a
quite different nature. The reader may have ob-
ferved Cato-Zwack at once exulting in having
founded a majonic Lodge at Munich for the Illumi-
nees, and in the viCtories ga:ined by the Illuminees
over the Rojic1'u&i411 Mf!ons. What can have
given rife to this cpntradiC\:ion, at the fame time
to imitate the Free-mafons, and to declare war
againft the moft famous adepts of Mafonry. Thefe
queftions naturally Jead us to the inv~ftiga.tion of
the moft profoqnd device that W eifbaupt ever in-
vented for the propagation of his plots. They
relate to his firft attempt, to the diverfity of the
means ufed, his fuccefs, and.· finally to his tri-
umphant intrufion into 'the mafonic Lodges. . In
order to folve them, I fha11 in the following Chap-
ters lay before my reader the moft remarkable
pa1fages of ~he Archives of the Sea, or of the
letters and avowals of the ItJoft ce~brated adepts
relating to th~t famous- plan, the . execution of

During the conftia we fee Weifhaupt daily in·
venting new means of triumph; but he was unde-
cided as to the ufe he 1hould make of his vi8:ory.
" In the firft place,"' he writes to Zwack, '' I
" 1hould have ·wifhed to fend to London for a
cc conftitution for our Brethren; and I 1hould ftill
cc be of that opinion if we could make ourfelves
" mafters of the Chapter (the Mafonic) o( Mu-
" nich. You would do well to try. I can come
" to no determination on that fubje8: until I have
" feen what turn our affairs take. Perhaps I 1hall
" only adopt a reform ; or it may be better to
" create a new fyllem of Mafonry for ourfelves;
cc or) may it not be thought convenient to incor-
cc porate Mafonry into our Order) and thus to
cc make but,one body of them both. . Time,alonc
" can decide this•."
To relieve the Founde'r from tb.is ftate of inde-
cifion, it was neceffary that he 1hould become ac- .
pJJiJ.. quainted with a man who laid lefs ftrefs on difficul-

of KNIGGE. At this name every honeft German

W eHhaupt to overpower Knigge with the whole
·weight of their hatred; and to heap on him alone
all the opprobrium of the Lodges now become the
great feminaries of lllui:ninifm. The truth obliges
us to fay, that Phi/li-Kaigge was no other than the
worthy tool of Spartacus-Weithaupt in this grand
intrufion. That which was executed by the one
had long fince been concdved by the other; and,
in all probability, had it not been for the pro·
found combinations of the one, the wicked acti-
vity of the other would have proved fruitlefs in its
attempts. Unfortunately in the re-union of their
baneful talents were to be .fo)llld all the requiiites
for the moft confummate confpirators; in the ·

has fooner aCl:ed than deliberated ; he fees where
evil can be done ; he does it, and is ready to
found a retreat, fhould his firft attempts fail of
fuccetS. The one forefees the obftacles he ma1
have to ~ncounter, and feeks to evade them; the
other proceeds boldly in fpite of aU, and .looks on

The confcioufnefs of his crimes would have been
to him that grateful fenfatioo which virtue raifes in
the honeft heart. The power of doing harm is
more dear to him, than a celebrity which might

Knigge, on the contrary, fhows himfelf ev.ery

it is difficult to form an idea of their author. In
this TheofopbicaJ Illuminee fome will behold a
man in· a conftant delirium ; others will trace the-
Sophifter and Infidel ; while others again will take
him for an impoftor and a hypocrite. Is it the
madman, the vifionary madman in. the regions of
Folly, that is fought? Let the reader follow him
in his frequent journies to the world of fpirits, or
let him·have the patience to hear him tell what
he has·feen. · On one fide he 1bows us a Paradife
perfectly correfponding with the earth, and the
angels doing every thing in the -other world that
men do in this. On the other, be defcribes
heaven and its plains, its forefts, its rivers, its
towns, and its provinces ; he then proceeds to the
fchools for the infant angels; to the univerfities
- for the learned angels ; to fairs for the commercial
angels, and particulai'Jy for the Englith and Dutch
angels. The fpirits are male and. female; they
marry, and Swedenborg was prefent at a marriage.
This marriage is celeftial; " but;" fays he, " we
cc are not to infer that the celeftial couples are
" unacquainted with voluptuoufuefs. • . • The
cc propenfity to unite, imprinted by the Creator,
'' exifts in the jpiritual bodies; as it does in the

From this delirium let us proceed to the im-
poftor. The· whole life and writings of Sweden-
borg depofe againft him. To begin with his
writings, it is always God or an angel that fpeaks.

We will .now 1how how thefe anecdotes are
blended with the hiftory of a Sett that has power-
tUlly contributed towards our Revolution.
Swedenborg, anterior to the derangement of his
mind,.had fhrmed a fyitem leading to Materialifm;
and this continued deeply rooted in his mind after
his illnefs. . He then added his male and female
fpirits, and .fome extravagances ot the fame na-
ture. With refpett to the remainder of his fyf;.
tern, he follows .up his principles in a confequent
manner, and unfortunately the whole tends to
Materialifm. Sophifters and infidels, no doubt,.
foon perceived that they could make a tool of this
unfurtunate man ; they fet him up as a Prophet, ·
and his reverie's were oppofed to the truths of
. Chriftianity. Let us for a momeat attend co his
moft zealous and artful apofiles. ·It is thus that
they fpeak ofhis firft works, in order to captivate
the reader's mind in favour ofhis fubfequent writ-
. ings. " According to the difcoveries made by

Firll OF all the general afi'emblies that had been
~~~~y- held by the Mafons for thefe laft twenty.years,
ed by whether at Brunfwick, Wifbaden, or in any c;»ther ·
~~fne towns in Germany, none could be compared with

was compofed. One might fay, that all the inco-
herent elements of Mafonry had been thruft into
.one den. Knigge informs us, that he had had the
honour of being deputed by his ancient brethren;
that he might have taken his feat and been prefent
at the deliberatiol!S ; but, forefeeing the i1fue of it,
he thought he could more ufefully ferve the caufe
of his new Illuminifm by directing the part that
Minos-Dittfurt was to atl: in the interior of the
Meeting, while he himfelf would hover around
and obferve the exterior. His firft pJan of attack
was to gain the Cf'emplar Majons of the Stritl 0/J-
feruance, with whofe fecrets he was well acquainted,
and he had frequendy attended their Lodges, that
he

he might through their means en(ure a maJority
of votes. Had he fucceeded in this plan, Weif-
baupt's code would have been decreed at this
general congrefS, and would have become at once
the ft-andard law for millions of Mafons fcattered
throughout the globe, who would thus have been
illuminized and ready to fally forth from their ·
lurking places .at the command of their Antifocial
.Chief.
When defcribing this plan of attack, Knigge
takes care to inform his readers why he a.ball*
.doned it-:-" I own (fays he) that I always re-
" tained a certain prediletkion for my former
" brethren ofthe Stritl 0/;jertJante ; I had already
." illuminized. fo great a number, that I was in
" hopes of uniting their fyftem with ours. My
" intention moil: certainly could never be to deliver
" up to the Congrcfs all our papers, and thus to put
" ourfelves at the mercy of the deputies. I had

that his miffion at Wilhemlbaden did not hinder

whofe reports I have juft ftated. It was.to him
that their reports· were firft fent; he tranfmitted
them to the Areopagites, after making fuch rc..
marks as his zeal for the propagation of the SeCt
might fuggeft. What he particularly blames in

ofregularity in their proceedings appeared to him
to impede their fuccefs, and to render .it lefs cer-

fome apprehenfions with refpeCt to a new congref$
that had been appointed for the following year at

of Mafonry; and who -was foon to become more
fo in thofe,of Illuminifm. The fon of a common
foldier .of -Bcunfwick, he was brought up as Mer
ofa regiment, -but he foon thought himfel( def..
tined to ad:·a higher part in the world than to ac-

ries· in the fymbols of that fame Equality and Li-

berty. The fervices that he had rendered ro the
Brethren m~y be appreciated by that which
Knigge believed to be fo much to his honor, when
he fays, that nearly all the littlt good that is to be
foiDld in thefy}Jem ofthe 8Jf'i&l Obftrumue is to be al-
lri!Juttd to Bode; or, in other words, every thing
.that affimilated their fyil:eni to that of Weifuaupt.
After having clofely fcrutinized his man, Knigge .
declares him to be advanced in years, but ftill in
quefi: of truth which he had not yet been able to
find, though he had be(n forty years a Mafon;
he depicb him as indifferent to all fyftems, though
petulant, fiery, and jealous of dom,inion; and as
loving to be flattered by Princes. ·To this de•
fcription I may addfrom my German Memorials,
that his exterior was unpolilhed and almoft de-
formed, which, however, did not hinder this old
Mafon from acting the part ofa wit and of a man·
offentiment·with the Ladies•. They alfo defcribe
him as a pedant, with an appearance· of frank-
nefs that Princes miftook for opennefs of ·cha-
racter; but with which they might not have been
fo eafily duped had they known, that though he
fought their favor, he as cordially hated them as
he did what he called the Mummeries of Religion,
o/ 1efuits, and of Priejls. Such fentiments muft
nece1farily have endeared him to the Illuminees.
Knigge more particularly courted him on· account
of the great inftuence he enjoyed over the Ger-
man

JUSTOiUCAL PART.
man Mafonry. Thefe two men fcrutinized each
other, and Knigge at length declares, that ''after
" many mutual explanations he . had admitted
" him to the degree of Scotch Knight."-
Here Bode found all thofe promifes to forward
the vie~s of the Order, to reveal all his difcove-
ries on Mafonry to his new Superiors, to inftall
the Illuminees in all the principal pofts of the
Lodges, and to embezzle their funds. Nont of
theft obligations appear to bavt given him any Until-
find's; but he feared, that in the end thofe un-
known fuperiors would turn out to be J efuits and
Priefts. It was neceffary, therefore, to remove·
fuch fears, and to guarantee to him that thofe ·fu-
periors detefted Priefts and Jefuits as much as he
did himfdf. " On this condition (fays Knigge)
cc he promifed, JjJ, To labor fot us, and, by
" means of the new Syftem or Code to be form-
" ed for Mafonry, to throw the empire over the
" Lodges into our hands. 'J.dly, To put the Di-
" rectories and provincial infpections, in as much
ct as depended on him, into the hands of the Il-
" luminees. 3dly, To prevail on the Brethren of
" the Strifl Objtruanct to fraternize with us. 4thly,
(, In the forming of the new Mafonic Code, never
'·' to lofe fight of the illuminized plan fOr the
" choice of Mafters or Venerables of Lodges.

" to caufe the J)Jdll!Xions promifed for the Siricf
n OO.forvanct to be printed at our prtffes, and to
" diftribute them to our Brethren according to
" agreement •.;. '
Such promifes from Bode were of too much
confequence to be rejected by the Dluminees ; he
was received with open arms, and, under the cha-·
ratl:eriftic of Amtlitt.r, was ufhered into the higher·
degrees. We fhall foon fee how faithfully he ac-
quitted himfdf of his promifes.
While Knigge was making fuch important ·ac-
quiGtions from Mafonry, Weifhaupt was medita-
ting another plan~ that was to inftall him Mafter
of all the Lodges of Poland. The Areopagite
Cato-Zwack received nearly at the fame time both
Knigge's official note relative to Bode, and the
W~- following letter from Weilhaupt: cc I have a·

)Vith-the comq1ittee .that was to frame the new
code. By the help of fuc_
h protection he fQ
ama~ingly ext~Il~ed .the nurpb~r of ~he adepts,
that W ei1haupt pretended to be alarm~d, or
was fo ill reality. Th~ defpotic founder vie~ed
:with ~ j~alous eye. the afcendant that Knigge waJ
~ily acquiring, l\nd the great enc;omiums beftow-
~d- . on l}im by :the adepts in their ~uibus Liiets.
Betide, his profound policy led him to conceive
that his power would be too much divided by that
~f Knigge•s, to enfure him fovereign fway over
his tenebrous. _
meetings, and to preferve that unity .
of object .and of aC\.ion whic;h his plots required.

Knigge. had invented in the degree of Epof>t; yet this il-
luminizing chief did not fcruple · to accufe the .
Baron of having weakened· them; the faa was,
that he could not forgive him for having· partici-
pated in the glory of founding the·Order. He
~ven pretended that Knigge was privately- laying
the foundations ofanother fecret (ociety•. Thefe
reflections weighed fo heavily On the mind of the
defpotic chief, that all on a fudden Knigge found
himfelf depofed at the very inftant when he was
moft elated with his fuccefi'es in the fervice ofthc
Order.
Weifliaupt took from him the direetic»l of hi~
provinces, ari9 made him fubject·tofome ofhis owl'\
pupils. · The manner in which Knigge received
this humbling news cannot be better ·defcribed
. than in his own letters to weifhaupt and to
Zwack. The latter had attempted to reconcile
·thefe two terrible competitors, particularly by
·atfeCl:ing to throw the whole blame of their dif·
-agreements on }.-[abomet and an'other' brother.

So far from allowing himfelf to be foothed by
thefe promifes, or affrighted by thefe menaces,
which Zwack was to tranfmit to· Ingoldftadt;
Weithaupt appeared to become more inflexible.
He·knew his agents too well; he was certain that
Knigge could never bring himfelf to betray him;
and indeed he muft h;lVe betrayed himfelf in de-
nouncing.his chief. That adept, without doubt,
might have deferted him and carried many of the
brethren with him; and Weithaupt would have
preferred fuch extremities rather than have: had
rebel adepts, particularly competitors, under him.
" What care 1 (he writes) for all thit multitude
'' of unmanageable adepts who wifb to. be guided

......At other

cc Vengeance is·a thing that I fhall with great dif-
cc ficulcy refift •."
All thefe letters depict Knigge as an adept de-
termined to withdraw himfelfat length from the
defpotifm of the .modern Spartacus ; not indeed
to abandon his plots, but in order to lay the bafis
of new affociations of Confpirators: Iri the midft·
of all thefe broils, it is worthy of remark, that
the injured competitor in his letters to Weifhaupt
and to Zwack intermixes anfwers and advice on
every thing that can tend to propagate ·the Order.
In his poftfcript of the 26th of Marth, forgetting·
on a fudden all his anger againft Wei.fhaupt,. he
· informs him, that Brother .Accatius folicits letters·
ofrecommendation and direCl:ions to the Brethren
ofItaly for another adept who is going to fecond
·Brother Hannibal in his miffion to thofe countries.
cc This·affair (fays Knigge) is of the higheft im-
cr portance to the Order ; for our man is an ex-
" cellent Scrutator ; and I do affure you that fpe-
cc cial good news is come relating to the Monks·
(.f ofItaly~" Moft certainly, difcontented Monks
of the ·ftamp of Dont Gerle$ might be found
there; but before they could be enrolled an arti-
cle' of the Cede which excludes the1n from the
Order was. to be difpenfed with. As 1 have aJ.;.

ready obfcrved, however, Knjgge·was always letS
fcrupulous thanWeifhaupt o,o the article of excep·
tions. ln thefe fame letters he waras the Areo-
,pagites to pay particular attention to the affairs of
the Order at Vienna;. and informs them, that he
bps important nc:ws from that country; and with
refpetl: to Poland, though he tnay be acquainted
with no perfon who could forward the federation,
he had people at ieaft in Livonia. And in his offi-

haps with more fuccefs than any of its Apoftles •.
Such tendernds for the welfare of the Order,
and zeal for the propagation of its plots, e~idently
demonftrates that Knigge, fo far from abandoning
it, expdl:ed to re-affume his former rank. It ap-
pears ftill clearer in the letter he wrote to Cat-o
by the very fame poft, by which he had fent all
his menaces to Weithaupt : " I have great views
" indeed for our Order, and that mak.c:s me for-

haupt needed no more to convince him that·this
warfare would terminate to his advantage. He
did not wifh to lofe Philo, but ftill lefs could he .
bear him as a rival. " If PbiiD (Weifhaupt fays
'' to Zwack) will return to me, and confefs that
" he is in the wrong, he will find me fuch asI for-

~' do not·fhow the leaft eagernefs to reclaim him~
" I wifh to prove to him that I can do without

The good. of the cauje, as Weilhaupt calls it
(that is, the propagation and triumph of Illumi'P
nifm with all its impious plots), was evidently as
dear to Knigge as to himfelf. · This mutual bias
to crime reconciled them together again, at leaft,
for a fpace of time fufficient to acquire for Illu..

Knigge had promifed to the Areopagites. It is

[educing than Knigge's·circular letter on EcleSive
or _E/eflive Mafonry. Many Lodges had {)f their
own accord acceded to his federation. Bode in-
troduced its laws into the new Majonk Ritua/.-
It was on feeing thefe laws that the Mafon who
beft forefaw their confequences exclaims, in the

" gained admittance into our Diretlories ; and that
" theyfuumled in fraternizing with the greater part
" of our Brethren of the StritJ Objer'li4nc,e. His
" lnfinuator Knigge had left him no alternative
" but to bring over Freemafonry to this unfortu-
" nate alliance, or to cruth the Brotherhood. To
tc the aftonithment and grief of every _
true Mafon,
" it was by the combined efforts of Bode and
" Knigge, that the greater part of the Lodges
" thJ:oughout Germany were tainted and infeCted
" with this baneful Illurninifm *."
I often meet with fimilar avowals and lamenta-
tions in the different letters and memorials that
I have received from German Mafons, heretofore
zealous for the honour of their Brotherhood, but
now lamenting the intrufion of the Banrian peft
among them. Some few Lodges, however, held
out againft it. That of Berlin, called of the 'l'hree
Globes, in 178j, publithed a circular letter, ana-
thematizing all Brethren who fbould pretend to
degrade Free-mafonry fo as to transform it into
a fociety of men confpiring againft their God and
their country. Whether this Lodge had not been
initiated into the laft myfteries of the Roficru-
cians and other confpiring degrees, or whethe'r

this anathema was but a lbam, the circular letter
had but little effect. The intrufion continued,
and became.fo general, that the illuminizing sea
in its inftructions to the Direfling 11/uminees makes
ufe of the following formidable expreffions : -
" Of all the legitimate Lodges in Germany, there is
,,. ONLY ONE that bas not coakjced with our Supe-
" riors, and this Lodge has been .obliged to fuf-
'' pend its labours •."
This declaration does not imply that the greater
number of the Brethren were already illumini:zed,
but only denotes that the Superiors, whether Ma.f·
ters, Wardens, or 'l'reajurers, of almoft every Lodge
had entered into the federation with Weilhaupt.-
But what an awful afpect does this fubterraneous,
power prefent ! A multitude of emiff:uies and
agents difperfed throughout the tenebrous receffes
of Mafonry. The Superiors once gained over,
the Lodges would make but a feeble and 1hort
refiftance.
The greater part of thefc fuccdfes were to be
att.ributed to Philo-Knigge ; neither did he hide
thofe pretenfions thllt could indicate the rival.-
W ei1haupt could not brook the moft difl:ant ap-
pearance of rivality ; new contefts arofe between

when he is informed of the manner in which he
had formerly received a fimilar propo.fition while
refiding at Manheim. One of his minifters at

propofed to him to call to his court the moft
famous Philofophers of the day, and to grant
penfions to thefe pretended great men, after the
example of Lewis XIV. who had been the pro-
tetlor of the learned men of his age. The glory
of fuch an undertaking feemed at firft t:o flatter
the Prince ; but on confulting men of real learn-

Theodore would no longer hear of the ProteCl:or-
1hip of Philofophifm. This anecdote was fent to
me by a perfon who heard it from the very
minifter that had made the propofition to the
· EleCtor.
It is not underftood how the court of Munich
acquired its firft knowledge refpetting Illuminifm;
the information it received was not fufficiendy ex-
plicit indeed to defcribe the fpirit of the Sea,.but
it gave a general idea of ·the danger of fecret
focieties. . On the 21d ·of June 1784, His Elec-
toral Highnef.s publiihed an Edict abfolutely for-
bidding all jecre.l communities, jocieties, and. confra-
ternities, other than thofe by law eftablifi1ed. The
·uncontaminated Mafons ihut up their Lodges ; the
Illuminized Mafons, who had many of their adepts
about the court, thought themfelves fl:rong enough
·to bid defiance to the Edict, and continued their
rr.eetings. A work publiihed by Mr. Babo, a Pro-
. felfor at Munich, entitled f'he fir:ft lf7arning on
Free-majonry, began to difclofe more clearly the
plans of the new adepts. Soon after the Count
Jofeph Torring made a more vigorous attack on
them. The Illuminees not only wrote apologies
in anfwer to thefe attacks, but fet many other en-
gines .to work, the ·artifice of which cannot be
better defcribed than by Weiihaupt's own letters
to his adepts.

chiefly dwells on the principles of the Sect.
After having fuown in a few words how Free-

candidate is gradually fettered in the bonds of the
Superiors, and how dangerous muft be a fervi-

-icllers though in the moft. active purfuits; he pro-
ceeds with the unfortunate MineMJal to the degrees

Thefe depofitions, notwithftanding their im·
portance, feemed to make but little impreffion.
Whether the tribunals were befet by, or in great
pllrt compofed of Illuminees, or not, I cannot
know; but they affected to treat thefe declarations
as containing nqthing either very ferious or me•
nacing; or whether the removal of Weifhaupt
had made them view the Sea as deftroyed, and
the confpiracy as cpunteracted, I do not pretend
to fay ; but certain it is, that at length Heaven·by
its thunderbolts warnS> nations and their rulers of
the plots contriving againft them, of the extent
of which plots they were ignorant ; neither had
they furmized the baneful activity of the confpi-
rators. Di'fmiffed from his public functions at
Ingolftadt, \Veifhaupt had taken refuge at Ratif- Wei(.

center of myfteries; all his plots had followed his/1°J.5
him thither; and fo far was he from looking upon b~n. t -
them as baffled, that he purfued them with re..
doubled ardour. Vengeance had rendered him
more terrible from the receffes of his new retreat;

he gives up his whole time to the preparation and

nifhed new·proofs ; and, being tranfmitted to the

degrees of Major and Mittor Illuminee. Another
remark may alfo be true, that as a preparatory
ftep the Illuminees only feek to deftroy all the
leffer powers .in order to form one or two great
ftates in Germany ; but that will not change the
fate decreed in the higher. mylleries for thefe
greater Princes of the.German nation, or for all
Princes and nations in general. This fingle Po-
tentate will then lhare the fame fate as Religion.
We have heard them talk of reducing the world
to the unity of Religion, as well as to the unity or
equality of.ftations. But has not the Setl: already
declared, that in order to be admitted to the laft.
fecret one mull begin by getting rid ofalJ religio11?
This plan, therefore, for reducing Germany under
the dominion of one Prince, is evidently nothing
more .than a preliminary ftep, in like manner as
their plan of fubjetl:ing Princes to the government
of their Order. When the proper time comes,
~ all ~hefe .plans are changed, in the leffons of the
adepts,· to the total annihilation .of every ftate,
pri~ce;.and civil gqvernment on earth.
The,Reader may eafily perceive how the Sea,
evea. fo ·early a~ the degrees in which the thrte
deponents had been adJ11itted, prepares them for
the laft fecrets; e!petij)ly when he fees immedi-
ately following the pretended union of Germany,

" country are incompatible with views of an im·
cc menfe extent, with the ultimate mds ofthe.. Ora",
" and one muft glow with ardour for the attain-
" ment of that end•."
In 'the Degrees alfo to which the·deponents
had been admitted we fee the Superiors inceffant-
Iy declaiming on that end; but they never mention
what it.really was. They even confefs that they
are not in the feeret ; they fay that the knowledge
of it is referved to the higher degrees; their own
declaration, therefore, proves that it cannot be
this unity of Religion or of Government to be
cftablilhed in Germany, as they are not ftringers
to that plan. Betides, how can it appear, that
the love of one's country, or national love, is in-
compatible with the wilh of uniting a great nation
under the dominion ofone Prince. On the other
hand/ we fee thefe maxims in perfetl accord with
the views of Illuminifm, when, advancing toward
the higher degrees, we hear the SeCt pouring forth

in ~ax-Maffenhaufen's ,hand, and in the cypher
of the Order, receipts for making the aqua toffana,

calumny be accufed of being fanguinary, as not
one of the adepts was condemned to death. This

with which Weifhaupt [educed them, by truncat4

fecret by which he blinded them and bound them
to the Order, by furrounding them with ~pts
who knew how to feize on the miniftry, on the
Dtcajkres, or councils, and occupied all the placet
of confequence by themfdves'or their creatures.
I will not pretend to fay, that thefe artifices of
Illuminifm can excuf~ thofe Pri_nces for becoming

undoubtedly the latter was but the juft puniih-

find LEwis ERNEST of SAxE GoTHA at the head
of thefe adepts under the characteriftic of Cf'imoleon.

of his error. He at prefent pays much greater
attention to the happinefs of.his fubjetl:s than t&

As to the late PRINCE OF NEuwr~:o, I know
not what name was given him in recompenfe,for
his devotion to the Sea ; but at his court it
might with truth be faid, the lllumine'es had
, acquired fuch an afcendancy, that if they had
gained a fimilar one in other parts, the world
muft have been theirs. This unfortunate Prince
little thought that his own fon would be d~prived
of all power in ·his own ftates, and that he would ··
be reduced humbly to folicit the Comitia of the
E~pire for leave to affert his own rights, and to
drive out from his ftates thofe adepts that had
been proteCted by his Father, and his Uncle the
Count Stolberg ; .or at leaft for leave to difmifs
them fi·om the employments they occupied, even
from that of the education of his children, which

Thus plainly did every thing denote, .that the

the Hegira of Mahomet had formerly been to
Mofiemifm, only the prelude to a greater and
more fplendid fuccefs. Experience now taught
Weifhaupt to combine new means, according to
his favorite maxim of appearing idle in the midft of
the greateft af/ivi!J. Perhaps alfo, content with
having laid the foundations of his confpiracy, and
with having arrived at that day which he ha:d lung
fince foretold, when he could defy the powe~ of
the earth to deftroy his fabric; or, perhaps, fatif-
fied at feeing he had now formed men able to pre.:

on .important occafions, leaving the com~on de-
tails, the functions of an ordinary chief, to other
adepts. However that may be, though it were

concealed than they are, yet proofs cf the plots
which they are now profecuting would not be
wanting. Their public aCtions fhall in future de-
pofe againft them in default of their fecret ar-
chives. The adepts were known ; it was there-
fore eafy to watch their labours and compare their
devices. The German writers have had the ftart
of us in that career; hiftory, therefore, will not
be deftitute of demonftrative proofs.
The grand objett of the Illuminees, after the They at·

for fuccour, in order to deftroy thofe ill impref-
fions which the Life of Zimmerman, Mr. Robifan's
Pt:oofs, and thefe Mtmoirs, were making. The
complaints of the Englifh fraternity, and the an-
fwer of their auxiliary Brother Boetiger, are in...
ferted in the German Mercury, No. 11, page 26;.
Nearly the fame anfwer has cro1fed the feas, in
order to intonn the Englifh, through the channel
of the Mr;rJthly Maga:~ine of January 1798,
page 3, that whoever 1hould tur(l his refearches
toward Illuminifm would be- in purfuit. of a- C
·hi-.
mera, " as from the /leginninJ of lht year 1790,
" EVERY CONCI!RN Of TH! lttLVMINATI HAS.

" be found among the papei'S of Mr. Bode, late
" Privy Counfellor at Weimar, who was ld tbe
"·head if the Order in this part of Germany, and
" who died in I79t·"
The foregoing paffage, written by Mr.
Boetigcr, may be obferved' ·to include a very
fingular avowal, wllich has already been noticed
io Germany to the great confufion of the adepts.
Some zealous writers have told them: You now
own then, that the myfteries of Illuminifm had
become thofe of the Mafonic Lodges, and that
they had continued to be fo till the year 1790 •
rhofe journalifts and other authors, therefore, who

inceffantly called the attention "ar fovereigns . to
.tht lllumipees, were, not miftaken ; ahd Zimmer-
m~n,_ Hoffman; .and Dr. Stark, with fo many
other writers whofe works the SeCl: · wifhed to
tupprefs, were corrett in {mbiidy proclaiming
that this difafi:,rous SeCt had not been annihile).ted
when its plots were difcovered in 1786, and much
iefs fo i~ 1785, as the adept writers of the Bro-
therhood or their hirelings had attempted to per-
fuade the world •. Now the confpirators think
that it will fuffite for their purpofe to ·make the
world ~elieve that the idea of their exiil:ence fince
the year 1j9o is chimericaL This artifice alfo
1hall be unma1ked, and nations lhall-be convinced
that though this sea: may have changed its form,
yet that in fo doing it has only invigorated itfelf,
and acquired new means of corruption.
The Situr Boetigtr, the ~ixotte of the Illumi- Bode, tlut '
neeS; and-of the Brother ·Bode in particular, alfo n;whchief
makes another avowal, viz. That his hero Bode ~e~,c
really Became the chief of the Illuminees in his

The Engli.fu may overlook the numeruus demands of this kind

ever made this ·avowal ; but it perfeClly coincides
with the information that I had received concern-
ing
that he has upon us in about half a dozen Magazines and
Reviews in which he co-operates, for his dUTertations on the
Roman Ltulies, on their toilets, and on their fans; on .Amtrictl
and on China; on tlie Etrufian Yafts, on the .AOing if 111
'laytr, and in lhort on many other fubjelb. But what it moft
concerns the Engtilh people to know, is, that the man, whofe
authority is fet up in favor of.the Brotherhood, is as well
known in Germany for his talents as a leader of faaion as he
is for his treatifes on toilets and fans. Nor did he on the
news of the immortal viaory of Admiral Duncan reftrain hi•
Jatobin Tage in l:is journals, or blufh at faying that it <will
,,./Hftd<Whtthtr the Englilh had gained this viCtory by the in·
torference of heaven or of hell, whether it cam1 fr~m a•rv1 •
!~tlow (von oben oder von unten); and that it was the opinion
ofmany, that it would have been a greater happinefs for th1
E11z/i.Jh to ha'l!t loft the !Jattle than to have gained it. Such,
neverthelefs, is the man whom we find placed in competition
with, and even fet up as an authority againft the patriotifm of
Mr. Rohifon.
This very fame man moreover writes to inform the Englifh
that he is no Illuminee. He may gain credit in England;
but in Germany he is afked what bufinefs he had with the
Minerva/ Lodges if Weimar? In what quality could he pre-
tend to inherit the papers of a chief of Illuminifm, which,
according to the laws.of the Sea, could only be entrufted to
brethren? Or for what reafon, after having been fo inti-
mately conneCted with Bode, does he tHII continue to be the
laborious co-operator of the adept W1 E L ~No in the NI'VI
German Mercury? .
· This auxiliary adept alfo writes to the Englilh, that the

But no fuch invitation is made to the Germans; to them he
talks of a Prince being in poff'efiion of all Bode's pa~rs, but
does not venture to name the prince. He knew too well that
perfons on the fpot might attempt to gain that admittance to
infpea the papers, if Boetiger's word could be a fufticient
incitement to thofe, who think they have acquired a certainty
that the prince poff'eff'or has powerful reafons, for ~tot jhf1'Wing
the t<t»o tri4nks full of papers that he bought at fuch an im-
inenfe rate, and for mt giving an invitation to the public
fimilar to that which the court of Bavaria ordered to be in-
ferted at the head of the Original Writings.
I, in my turn, invite the Author of the Month{J Maga..
t~r.int to infert thefe refteaions in his publication, as he di~
Boetiger's letter in oppofition to Mr. Robifon in that of Jan.
1798. My reafon for making this invitation is, becaufe I

~ter. and really thought that.the exitl:ence of this sea and of
its plots, the moll: monthous and moft fubtle that ever exifted,
was chimerical.

the various means.devifed, 0111 might appear fin·
gularly ridiculous but for the aftonifhing adnn-
tages drawn fro.m it by the Sect: I mean the fable
of the Jifuits M(ifonry. A prodigious number of

thofe who invented the fable, and by others who
thought it incumbent on them to warn the public
of this new artifice of Illuminifm. I will not

NICOLAI and BIESTElt at Berlin~ and a fwarm of
other Dluminees, fought to give fanB:ion to this
Fable by their writings. As yet, however, itwas
difficult to for~ a precife idea of this ftory of the
Jefuits Mafonry, or whether it was true or falfe.
Bode at length made a colleCtion of every thing
that could be faid on the fubject, and fent the
whole of thefe materials to the Brother BoNN~·

On inveftigating thefe. different produB:ionsJ
we obferve, that their drift was to make the Free-

The name of Jefuit is cer~ainly a formidable
bug-be~r to many people~ efpecially to thofe who.
could never pardon i:heir zeal for the Roman Ca,..
tholic faith ~ and it cannot be denied, that if con-
ftancy in the ~aufe of that religion was hClteful, they
were well entitled to the hatred of the enemies of
the Catholic faith. It is obfervable, that it was ill ,
thofe very p~rts of Germany ·where the Lodges
were chiefly ~ompofed of Proteftant brethren"
that this f~ble made the moft ~ftonilhing ~mpref-
hsfuccefs. fion, nothing being talked of but Jefuits under
the cloak of Mafonry, and the~r great confpi:-
racy. One might have thought that the confpiracy
c:>f the Illuminees was entirely forgotten; but that
. was not their only object. The Mafonic Brethren
of the ordinary Lodges heard fo much of their.
being the dupes of the Jefuits~ that they aban~
doned the Strict·Obfervance and the Roficrucians; ·
and flocked to the Eclectic Mafons, then under

Mafonry, that its zealous Mafters and Venerable~

confpiracy truly worthy of a Danton or a Robef-
pierre•. In vain did the more clearlighted Ma-
fons point out the fnare, to vindicate their re- .
putation and put a ftop to the g~neral defertion•.
Their demonftrations came too late; btlide, they
were written by Proteftants, who were ftrongly
prejudiCed againft the Jefuifts or knew but little .
about them t. But, unfortunately, when Germany•
really difcovered the drift of the fable, the greater ·
part of the Mafons had un,ited with the Illuminees
for fear of falling a prey to the Jefuits, and many
others had entirely abandoned the Lodges, chufing.
~o be neither Illuminees nor Jefuits. Thus was
that threat of Weifhaupt accompiifhed, that he

felted Jefuits, that is, thofe who to the three firft vows have
added that of going to preach the Gofpel in whatever part
of the world the Pope ehofe to fend them. Thefe were called
the proftffid jefuits ;. but the word proftffid would not ferve
Bonneville's purpofe, he wanted an.N; he fays therefore, that
thefe proffffid were called Nojlri, he then gets an N, the evi-
dent Notu~a of the Sc.:>tch Maller in Mafonry. Thus it is
that by comparing the T. S.C. N. of Mafonry with the
IT. S. C. N. that he had difcovered among the Jefuits, he
proves that the degrees of Scotch Mafonry are the fame as
thofe of the jefuits. {Stttht Jefuits expelled Ma.fonry, Yo/. II.

1hall then have a pretty accurate idea of the ge-
neral courfe followed by the Illuminizing Mafons.
lt would be exaCtly as if any hifi:orian wtre to take
it into his head, when treating of Weilhaupt's
Code, to fubftitute the word Jefuit in lieu of ll-
luminee, and that without being able to name a
~gle Jefuit againft whom the accufation could be
preferred, notwithftanding the ardent defire of
thefe barefaced calumniators to mention fame one
at leaft of the culprit Jefuits. It is a·tong feries
of contradiCtions. .Neither do they agree as .t~.
the time, the degrees, or· the myfteries of thi$
Mafonry of the Jefuits. The fole faCt that might
deferve to be inveftigated, had any proof been
fortune was, that even thofe Jefuits who had taught in their .
colleges had generally terminated their courfe of divinity an<\
taken their lall vow by the age of thirty•thrlt.
Were I to go on to fuow, that the G, or the G!d, of the
Mafons becomes the General of the Jefuits, b~aufe General

writer$ of the sea: inundated the public with
their libels in verfe or profe, under the forms of
comedies, romances, fongs, and differtations. -
All the tenets of religion Catholic and Proteftant
were attacked with the moft bare·faced impu-
dence. Now the fcene began to change; it was
no longer to defend the Proteftants againft the
attacks of the Catholics ; but the obliteration of
every religious tenet became their obvious defig~.
The moft pompous eulogiums were pronounced
by the journalifts of the Sea on ail thofe pro-
duttions of the brethren that openly dilfeminated
every principle of Impiety and Sedition •. But
what muft appear a ftill more aftonithing ·con-
tradittiori, though perfectly coinciding with the
views of the Sect, is, that thefe very men who
withed fo defpotically to fway the public opinion~
r and crulh every writer that had not imbibed their
principles, would pretend to perfuacle Sovereigns
that their fole object was to obtain that right
inherent to them from nature, ~ to pubHth their
opinions and fyftems without danger or conftraint.'
Bahrdt in particular vindicated this pretended
right, in his pubJication On the Li!Jerty ofthe Pr¢.
· It contained the fentiments of a rank Atheift, who
wifbed to imbue his reader with all the moft

~bominable principles of Anarchy and Impiety ;
th~ author, neverthelefs, was extolled by the heb-
domadary adepts, and, notwithfi:anding Bahrdt's
vindication of the. liberty of the prefs, they
united all their efforts to crufh every writer that
dared to affert an opinion contrary to theirs. .
The ufe which the brotherhood made of this
liberty at length aroufed the attention of fome
few fovereigns. Frederic William, King of Pruf-
fia, alarmed at the progrefs which thefe impious.
and feditious writings were making, thought it
neceffary ·to put a curb on them. He publifhed
fome new regulations, called the Editls for Reli-
.gion. This was received by the llluminees with
an audacity which feemed to denote that they had
already acqu,ired a ftrength fufficient to bid de-
fiance to fovereigns, and both the _Prince and the
Edict became the objects of their farcafms and·
moft violent declamations. · At length appeared a
work attributed to Ba.hrdt, that was the acme of
infolence, and, through derifion, was alfo called the
I.ts difco- Edielfor Religion. The magiftrates ordered to

ta e cogmzance o 1s Jn1U t 1e1zed on t e per-

miniftry; and numerous arguments were invented
for condemning to oblivion thefe archives ofa new
fpecies ofconfpiracy. All that tranfpired was, that
the plan had been really formed, and that a num- ·
her of authors, bookfellers, and perfons even who
could fcarcely have been fufpected, had entered
into the a1fociation. It is not known how far W eif-
haupt had contributed perfonally to it; but it ap-
pears that he twice attended at the head.quarters
of the united brethren ; that he fpent feveral days
with Bahrdt; and that the moft zealous and active
of the united brethren were alfo difciples of
W eifbaupt. If we are to believe Bahrdt, his
fecret was betrayed by two affociates well worthy
of their mafter. Thefe . were two young liber-
tines, nearly beggars, but who had the talents and
meannefs neceffary to become the clerks of his
impiety. Notwithftanding the proofs adduced
againft him, he got off with a flight imprifon-
ment, and fpent the remainder ofhis exiftence
in diftrefs, but without atoning for .his vices.' He .
was reduced to keep a coffee·houfe at Baffendorff
near Halle, where he ended his days as miferably
as he had lived. The Illuminees have thought
fit to abandon his memory to that contempt
which his vicious life had entailed upon him ; but,

neverthelefs continued to profecute his l'lans~

infected with thofe literary focieties which were
nothing more than a modification of Weifhaupt'$
Miner7Jal fchools. Nor was there in a fhort
time·a town or large village more free from this
fpecies of literary focieties than from the Illumin-
ized Lodges ; and they were all under the direction
of the followers of the modem Spartaau.
Bahrdt's great objed: _was, to place th~ affo-
ciates and other readers under a fort of impof-
fibility .of procuring any other writings, or of
applying to any other ftudies, th:m thofe of the
Sect ; and the precaution it had taken to initiate
fo many bookfdlers proved a powerful fupport.
The confpiracy might have a1fumed a new fotm;
but it ftill continUC!d atl:ive, and its effe& became
more perceptible after its difcotrety. It was then
that the coalition appeared between the bookfellers
and the journalifts of the Sect to fupprefs aH
books that couriterafud the progrefs of Sedition
and Impiety. It was ·in vain for virtuo~s and
pious men to attempt ~o open the eyes of the
people ; they could fcarcely find a bookfeller or
a printer who would fell or print their works ;
or if any had confented they would endeavour to
difguft the author by delays, and a hundred other

pretexts. .Did the author undertake to print it at
his own expence, the work was .then thrown by
in fome obfcure corner of the fhop and never
expofed to fale, nor would any bookf,ller attempt
to fell it ; and the whole work would be fent back
to the author under pretence that nobody would
buy it. The very exiftence of fuch works was
not mentioned at the fairs held in Germany for
the fale of books.. At other times the author
was irangely betrayed, the printer giving up his
_
manufcript to the writers of the Setl:, and the
refutation (if the moll: fcurrilous abufe can de-
ferve that name) was advertifed on the back of
the book as foon as the firft edition !llade its ap-
pearance. Many authors might have brought
a&ions againft their printers of a fimilar nature
to that which Doctor Stark was obliged to bring,
·and demonftrate a fimilar connivance with the
Setl: and breach of truft. " At leaft it is an un-

bookfellers when they were fent back under the
moft opprobrious pretences ; and what may fur-
prife the reader is, that no .perfons were fo certain
of receiving fuch refufals as thofe who moft openly
defended their Princes. In the very ftates of the
King of Pruffia it was found impoffible to get this
fovereign's .Apo/Dgy and his Edifl for Religion fold
in the common way. Scarcely had the author
, fent a few copies to the bookfellers when. they
were all returned to him. But did the writers of
t~e Seet,wilh to publifh the moft fcandalous dif-
putatioqs and the moft fcurrilous abufe againft
fovereigns and religion, or againft men in office
or of high refpettability, the bookfellers were
alert in felling them, the journalifts extolled their
excellence, and fought numerous readers for the
author*.
On one hand, the great trade in thefe produCtions
carried on by the.Sea, with the certainty of felling
them to the literary clubs ; and on the other the
great pecuniary ~ontributions made by·the rich
brethren, formed huge funds for the coalition.

.how well .thefe funds fufficed fo~ indemnifying
,thofe bookfellers who had fuffered lolfes by re-
ftraining their commerce to w~rks approved of
by the Areopage. A particular fund was efta-
blilhed for this purpofe. At the appointed time
the bookfeller had but to produce the lift of the
works he had fuppreffed or refufed to fell, with
the proper proofs, and he received a fum of
money fufficient to indemnify him for fuch loifes.
The memorials which I have received from Ger-
many, as well as feveralletters, inform me that
,this fund ftill exifl:s in that country; and the
French Revolution has only furnilhed it with many
.other means of enriching itfelf.
Among the great advantages reaped by the
Sea from this plan which had been fo well con-
certed, we may firft obfe~ve the irnpoffibility
under which authors lay of warning the public

the great care with which they initiated the dif-

It is a painful truth, but we muft declare it, and

ceived from the twenty-two chiefs an invitation to
become a fellow of the literary fociety which they
had already.eftablifhed in that town.. " My an-

" made me conceive the horrid plot that was con-
" cealed under this affodation."
The reader will e'\fily conceive, that for a man
of his merit and probity, this was more than fuf-
ficient to ·make him rejeCt the offers of fuch a

name on their regifters, and they were obliged to
erafe it. · As a proof that he had judged rightly

Thefe abominations, however, were far from
making a fimilar impreffion on the other apoftles
of the Germanic Union~ Meanwhile Weifhaupt,
atranquil fpeB:ator of the progrefs of his Illumi-
nifm, feemed to take no part in .it. The moft
ad:ive adepts lived round about him at Gotha, at
Weimar, at Jena and at Berlin; but one might
have ·thought him quite indifferent as to their fuc-
cefs. If we except the vifits he received from the
brethren, a few journies that he took, and parti-
cularly thofe which he had made to fee the founder
of the Germanic Union, nothing could depofe
againft him as the founder or chief who continued
to direCt the plots of the SeCt. But let the reader
never lofe fight of his precepts on the art of ap-
pearing perfeCtly idle in the midft of the greateft

he iffued fix months after his flight from Munich:
Let our enemies rejoice. 'l'heir joy jhall joon be

eafy to judge of his fuppofed nullity in the pro-

twelve years when Germany was overrun with an
immenfe number of adepts and demi-adepts. It
was affuming a menacing afpett jn Holland, in

ZIMMERMAN,' who began by being the chief of
a Lodge at Manheim, and who foon became as·
zealous for the propagation of the Setl:, as the
Famous ZIMMERMAN had been to counteract their
dark qefigns, would often brag that he had founded ·
'more than a hundred of thofe confpiring clubs··
known under the name of literary focieties, or of
Mafonic Lodges, during his career through Italy,
Hungary, and Switzerland. To give the fatal
impulfe to the world, it now only remained for the
Sect to carry its myfteries into a nation powerful
and atHve indeed, but unfortunately more fufcep-
tible of that effervefcence which bereaves man of
the power of thinking, than of that judgment>
which forefees difafters; to a nation which, in its ·
ardor and enthufiafm, too eafily forgets that true
greatnefs is rtot that courage which bids defiance
to danger (for the vandals and barbarians can

This defcription unfortunately was too applical>le
to France, which in many refpetl:s might claim the
primacy among nations, but was too eafl.ly led
away by illufions. The fcrutinizing Areopage had.
fixed its eyes on her, and now judged it a conve-

As early as the year 1782, Philo and Spartacus·
had formed the plan of converting the French
nation to their Syftem of Illuminifm ; but the
vivacity and capricious temper of the people, fo
difficul~ to be reftrained, made it feem prudent for
the two Chiefs at that time not to extend their
attempts beyond Strafuourg. The explofion in
France might be premature; its too volatile and
impetuous pec;>ple might be unwilling to wait till
other nations were properly prepared for the
grand objeCl: ; and W eifhaupt, in particular, was
not a man to be fatisfied with partial . or local in-
furreCl:ions, which might only ferve to put other
Sovereigns on their guard. The Reader has al..;

and at the appointed hour, legions of brethren
were to fpring forth on all fides from their fecret

· Europe, in fhort, was to be revolutionized at the

a 14th of July;· and all kings were, like Lewis
the Sixteenth, to awake prifoners in the hands of
their own f4bject:s. Altars and thrones were fimul·
taneouOy to vanith from the earth. According to
this plan, as has juft been obfc:rved, the French

was in the illuminizing arts. Well acquainted
with the reafons that had induced the Chiefs of
the Order to defer the converfion of France, he
found means to convince them, that the time was
now come for the accomplifument of their views;
that the whole nation only waited for their new
revolutionary means, to btirft into an open re-
belli~n, for which they had been fo long prepared

This device made the French believe that they were

would as it were dafs themfelves according to
the degree of error they had adopted, or the
views that had prompted them to engage in the

Randon, Chenier, Mercier, Gudin, La l'vletberie, and
the Marquis de Ia Salle, who, not finding the Lodge
of the Social ContraCt fufficiently philofophized,
had come over to Condorcet. There was alfo
Champfort, who never could think that the -revo-
lution of Equality and Liberty advanced with
fufficient rapidicy, till at l~ngth, fettered in its
chains, .he could find no otht'r refource in his
Philofophifm than fuicide. Among the apoftate
clergy that had flocked thither, we find Noel~
Pingre, and Mulot. The two latter, together
with Lalande, were alfo members of the Secret
Committee of the Grand Orient. Dom Gerles, in
company with Rabaud de St. Etienne and Pelion,
came and joined the Lodge of the Nine Sifters
in the early time of the revolution. !f..auchet took

error (fo fcandalizing to the· Social ContraB) ori-
ginated in a work called Le.s Majques Arraches,
publifhed under the feigned name of JaqJUs Le
Sueur, which is nothing but a fcurrilous libel on
perfons of the higheft refpefrability. This author ·
transforms men whom 1 have known to be the
moft violent enemies to the revolution into the
moft zealous abettors of it. He alfo makes the
Duke de Ia Rochefoucault, the Abbe Fauchet,
Bailly, and La Fayette, members of the Social
Contratl, though they never belonged to it. He
places it under the diretl:ion of the Grand Mafter
Philip of Orleans, whereas it never filiated from
any Lodge but th;lt of Edinburgh. He paints
the venerabl~ Cardinal of Malines in the falfed:
colours, as will evidently appear to every perfon
who is acquainted with his high reputation for
virtue and wifdom. On the whole, I do not

and even there he ·is moft abominable in his per~

I have befides acquired a certainty, that Weif-
haupt's emiffaries could not have applied to men
more inimical to his fyftems, whether Mafonic or
Anarchical, than the members of the Social Con-
Irati, as by their orders the famous work writtell
by Bonneville, Bode's great friend, was burnt in
open Lodge. In fhort, I have in my poffeffion
. the original letter (or, in Mafonic language, the .
p/ancbe tracee) written by a man with whom I was
acquainted, and on the formal deliberation of the
Social Contrafl tranfinitted to feveral other lodges,
to engage them co join in a federation for the
fupporc of Louis XVI. againft the jacobins. It is
true, that the ·royalift brethren of chis Lodge
were the complete dupes of this projected fede-
ration, for they invited the Lodges to form an
union for the maintaining of the King according
to the conftirution of 1789. Louis XVI. who
really wiihed to keep the oath that had been
forced from him, to be true to the confticution,
was very well pleafed with the lift of the fede-
rated Mafons; but Mr. de La Porte, then mi-
nifter, was of a different opinion. When he faw
the
D1g1tlzed by Coogle
HISTOJt.JCAL P.A..T.·
the circular letter, and' the number of perfons wao
had fubfcribed it, he faid, " It is impoffible that
" thefe perfons can be other than conftitutioDal-
cc ifts, or that they can ever become ftaunch roy-
" alifts." - " Let us begin (rejoined the agefltl
cc of the Social Contratc) by maintaining tbe king
~' in his prefent ftau·, and we .will afterwards find
" .means of re-eftabli1hing the true Mo.11archy.'•
This anfwer may ferve as a vindication for the
members of the Social Co11tra~ ; but their good
intentions did not make their delufion the lefs
. complete. In the firft place, they mi:bt have feeo,
but they did not fee, that the greater number of
thofe who had figned the letter were men wlact
wi!hed to continue! to enjoy their Equality and
Liberty under a King reduced to the condition of
a mere Doge to the fovereign and legiOative peo·
ple; and that La Fayette, Bailly, and many other
revoJ.utionifts, would have figned this letter, with-
out ceafing .on that ~ccount to be jacobins and re-
bels. Neither did they reflea, that many of thofe
conftitutional brethren would have turned againil
the Social Contrafl, as foon as they perceived the
plan for reinftating the Monarch in his ancient
rights ; nor that it was far more eafy to entice
thefe conftitutionalifts into the moft outrageous
democracy of the great club, than to bring them
back to the principles of real monarchy. In !hort,
they had overlooked the vail: number <>f adepts of
democracy
D1g1tlzed by Coogle
ANTISOCIAL CONSPIR.ACY;
democracy who would infallibly denounce them
as traitors to Equality and Liberty, which after-
wards proved to be the cafe. .It was to verylittle
purpofe that the ·abettors of this federation termi•
nated their letter with the following words: -
cc This table is only for your chapter. Make dif-
. ~' creet ufe of it. We have two Jacred interefts to
ic ~anage, that of the French Monarchy and its
" King, and that of Mafonry and its Members."
The interefts of Mafonry carried the day; for, at
the very time that the demi-adepts were fubfcrib-
ing the letter, the more profound adepts were
from every quarter denouncing the federation .to
the great club, and the Social Contrafl was itfelf
profcribed.
Certain of this faCt:, and obferving that the
brethren of the Social Ccntrafl-pofitively declare,
in the table tracee (which I have before me) that
all political and deliberating clubs Jhonld be Jup-
prejfed; being alfo affured, .by feveral Mafons, that
it was from the Committee of the Amis reunis that
the invitations were fent to go and deliberate with
the German deputies, I find myfelf obliged to
differ with thok writers who declare the Emif-
faries of Illuminifm to have alighted at the Social
Contract, and who attribute to that Lodge the
political committees eftabli1hed on their arrival.

it was not on fuch occafions that a coalition was

they had to act. Others again would work cures
on healthy dupes, to fwindle away the money of
thofe who .were really ill. In a word, 't:Jr[mfr pre-

that they had been attraB:ed from Germany by

that their arrival could not have been later ~an

·and its IMbs were entirely abandoned, or cenfined
to a few adepts, the object of public ridicule, who
reforted to the hotel o( the Duchefs of Bourbon.
Such a pretext, therefore, at that period would
have been as much ridiculed as were Mejmer's
dupes. . The Notables, the Parliament, Brienne,

It is an obfervation that did not efcape the notice of the
German writers, and whic:h I repeatedly find in the memorials
fent to me, that the greatefl vwonaries of the Roncn1cian
Mafons and of the Philaletes are Iince become the moll zea-
lous apoftles ofWeiJhaupt's IUuminifm and of his Revolution.
The Germans particularly mark out one BUlmer, a famous
Martinift of Pruflia, and a Georg~ FOjfer, who in his great zeal
for the myfleries of Swedenborg would pafs fifteen days in
failing and prayer to obtain the vifion of a fpirit, or to dif-
cover the Philojoph.er's Stone. Since that time, however, they
have both turned out to be moll outrageous Jacobins.- In
France many examples of this kind may be adduced : Prunelle
'' Lierre, for inflance; a man heretofore of moft amiable cha-
ratter, and a very good naturalift. He firft became a redufe
Martinift, and foon after as outrageous a Jacobin as FOjfer.-
As for Per!ifo, the bookfeller, he atled the fame part at Lyons
for .the correfpoftdence of the Martinifls, as Savalette de
Lange did at Paris; but he did- not take the fame pre-
cautions. One might fee him going to the Lodge
followed by his port-folio, which a fervant could fcarc:ely
carry. Weifhaupt's code gained admittance to this port-
folio ; the revolution took place; and Perilfe, together with
his co.adept Milanois, became as outrageous Jacobins as the

Having no farther oppofition to fear, and cer-
tain of paffing whatever decrees they chofe, thefc:
confpirators proceed to declare themfelves a Na-

right of making and of pronouncing the law.
The fecrcts of the Lodges conftitute the bafis of
the Revolution under the title of the Rights of
Man. The firft article declares man to oe equal and
free; that the pri71ciple of all jovereignty e.ffentiaily
refides in the people ; and that law is nothing more
than the exprej}ion of the general will. Such had
been for nearly half a century the doctrines of
Argenfon, Montefquieu, Rouffeau, and Voltaire.
Thefe principles of pride and revolt had long
fince been the ground-work of the rnyfteries of
every dafs of Sophifter, Occult Mafon, or Illu-
minee; and now they de~orate the title-page of
the revolutionary code.
This equal, free, fovereign, and legiflative peo-
ple, may will that their religion fhould be pre-
frrved in all its integrity ; and that its monarch
fhould be entrufied with the neceifary power to
crulh [edition and rebellion. Venc:-ration for the
altar and affection for their prince frill glowed in
the heart of the .French. But the confpirators ·
wanted an armed force, drawn from the body of

theirs. This force was entirely to overpower the
army ofthe fovereign. Every thing had been fore.:..
feen ; for the fophifters had long fince faid, " Oh

'' military hirelings ! An army of natives might
" be gained to the fide of Liberty, at leaft a part

In both.we may obferve that fame hypocrify pre-

not to know, that every individual who lhall be

to his views or to his pleafures, and will little re-
gard the future Cofmopolites, their univerfal

The fame inept fatalifm is taught by them both,
wifbing to reprefent nature as acting ~xactly as it

over our paffions by its general laws J and never-
thelefs repr<:fent mankind as Oow in feconding the

accelerate or to retard its views by our aCtions.
The only 4itference that can be perceived be-

is, that the one at Konigiberg envelopes his views
in a pacific cant; while the other, in his myfte-
ries, animates aqd infuriates his Epopts, teaching
that the day is not far dillant when the adepts are
to refort 'to force, in.order to crulh and fiifle every
thing that lhould dare to refifi them. But notwith-

that is to be enjoyed by future generations, they
have begun by declaring a-war-of. cannibals againft

Jy one of their offspring, that ·is not ready to be-

forms and names; but, however thefe ma:y differ,
it perpetually keeps that unhappy country in a
ftate of crifis. Every throne is undermined by a
volcano that menaces explofion whenever a fa-

objects were far from contributing to the Revolution is, that
the Jacobins fpare no pains to dellroy .them. In a book

his fpleen againft the tenets of a Catholic? I might fay to

-volution both Proteftants and Catholics 1hould unite, and
Jay afide their prejudices againft each other, to combat the
impiety of the Ja.cobins, as their aim is to annihilate the re-
ligions of both. . Befuie, what party has a right to boatt,
when the Revolution is confidered ; Sparta(IIS-WeiQlaupt and

Lucian-Nicolai two apoftate Proteltants-Thomas Paine an
apoftate Anglican. In France, the Catholic citizens of Paris,
the Proteftant citizens of Nifmes; in Ireland, large portions
of a Catholic populace organized into a revolutionary army
under Proteftant chiefs. Jn Germany, the Illuminees take
theU:. origin in a Catholic Univerfity, and all the Lutheran
Univerfities are full of llluminizing Profeffors. Such,confi·
derations as thefe 1hould certainly put an end to reproach
4ln either fide. I muft confefs, that the Lutherans and Cal-
vinifts with whom I c:orrefpond in Germany are much more
candid ; they fpare neither fide, and are the firft to point 01.1t
thofe of their own perfuafion who are ~inted with llluminifm.
They behold the Jacobins as enemies to every religion ; and

eafily feen at prefent, that the diforganizing myf-
teries of the occult Lodges are at leaft anterior to
the reign of the French Sophifiers. Thefe may
have new-modelled them after their fafhion, and
multiplied and varied the degrees ; but their prin-
ciples had been received in the Lodges long be-
fore Voltaire wrote. The Knight Kadofth was al-
re~y extant in the Scotch Arcbiteff. When the
latter is afked in his catechifm, what he is called,
he anfwers cunning and fimple ; the Kadofth may
anfwer bold and impatimt. The difference lies in
the charatl:er, and not ih the·fyftems. This de-
gree of Scotch Archittff alfo explains whence the
pre-eminence of the Scotch Lodges arifes, and
why the Lodges of other countries are fo defirous
of correfponding with the motHer Lodge called
the Lodge Heredom if Kilwinning, in Scotland. It
is there that the famous Architeffs of Equality and
Liberty are fuppofed to be the guardians of the
taft myfteri~s. It was with this Lodge alfo, that a
number of French Lodges at Marfeilles, Avignon,

In the whole progrefs of the Sect, wherever
it has acquired fovereignty, in France, in Hol-
land, in Brabant, in Savoy, in Switzerland, in
Italy, tearch for a lingle man of property that
has preferved it entire; a poor parent that has not
had to fear for the requifition of his children, or
his own labor ; a lingle family that has not to
weep for the lofs or ruin of fame one .of its

fay, when he awakes, that his property, his liber-

have little to fea~ from them. The true Jacobirt
is not to be difcouraged by oppofition. 'the myf-
teries infufe into the adepts a uniform, conftant,
and relentlefs, determination to attain the grand
object in fpite of every obftacle ; that oath, that
irrevocable oath of overturning the whole uni-
verfe and fubjed:ing it to their fyftems, is the true
principle whence originate their refources; this
fires the zeal Q( the adepts, and induces them to
make fuch numerous facrifices ; it infpires its war-
riors with enthufiafm ; it creates rage and fury in
the heart of its brigands. It is this principle
which conftitutes the Sect; in that its force re-
fides; it is the director and mover of its ac.lepts,
whether in arms, in the clubs, in the lodges, or
deliberating in the fenate. - But what inferences
may not nations draw from this very principle as
to the nature of their plots ?. Does it not entitle
us to fay, that the whole of the French revolution
is nothing more than the offspring of that oath,
of that premeditated determination of overturning
the altar,, the throne, and fociety, which the Sect
has infufed into its adepts? It triumphs becaufe it:
knows how to will; hence it is evident, that ·tO
render their efforts abortive we need. only refo-

To know the evils with which the revolution threat·

ON publilhi.ng the Tranfiation. of the Firft Volume of
thefe Memoirs, I declared that I confidered myfelf as ortly
fulfilling a duty in.laying open fo excellent a work to
thofe of my countrymen who were not fulliciently verfed
in the French language to read the original. The objed:
of the Author throughout has been to thew the univerfal
havock and defolation with which thefe depredatory Sect$
have threatened all Europe; Mint has been to excite the
vigilant attention ~f my countrymen, left they fall into
the fnares that are laid to entrap them. This will, I hope,
be thought a fuflicient reafon for the following more cir-
cumftantial applicatio~ to Ireland and Great Britain of
the dreadful plots that have been detailed in thefe Me--
moirs.
IRELAND.
Ireland, ever lince the year 1782, had prefented a per-
petual fcene of-ditferent affociations for different objects.
The Volunteers had given rife to much debate; the Ro-
man Catholics had been a~ively employed in petitioning
the legillature for the redrefs of certain grievances under
which they laboured; and their prayer was at length
partly acceded to.
The firft appearance, however, of the affociation to
which we now allude was in June, 1791. The propofals
for itare couched in the ftyle and exact terms of the Hie-
a .ropbants

tophants of Illumi:nifm. They recommend the (ormation
of an afrociatiQn, or, as it is fiyled, " a beneficent con-·
" fpiraci' to ferve the people ; alfuming " the fecrecy
" and fomewhat of the ceremonial a~tached to Freema-
" fonry." Secrtcy is declared to be necefrary to make
" The bond of union more cohefive and the fpirit ofunion
" more ardent; to envelope the plan with ambiguity, to
" facilitate its own agency, to confound and terrify its
" enemies by their ignorance of the defign~ extent, and
" direction," &c. Its' Ceremonial is alfo M.afonic in order
to create enthufiafm•. " Let every member wear (day
" and night) an amulet round his neck, containing the.
" great principle which unites the·brotherhood, in letters
" of gold, on a·ribbon, firiped with all the original co-
" lours, and indofed in a fheath of white filk, to repre•
·" fent the pure union of the mingled rays, and the aboli-
" tion of all fuperficial diftinClions, all C<?lours, and
·" fhades of difFerence, for the fake of one illul.lrious,End.
" Let this amulet of union, faith, and honour, depend
" from the neck, and be bound about the body next to the
" lkin and clofe to the heart.'' Ma(o~ic Secrecy, Equa-
lity, and Union, cannot poffibly be better defcribed.
Its members are to be chofen from among men in the
prime of life, without diftintlion of religion; . true phi·

" that wizard word .EMPIRE, nor to the fovereignty pf
" two. founding fyllables ;" fr~m among men, in fh~rt,
" who know liberty, who wifh.to have it, and who are
" determined to live and .die free-men" (vivre libre QU

cc amplitude of co~ception commenfurate to the progref·
" five diffufion of knowledge ; - it will make the light of
" philanthropy converge." Its END is declared .to be,
" The rights ofmen in Ireland; the greateft happinefs of
" the greateft number in this Iaand; the ihherent and in·
" defeafible claims of every free nation :" For, " the
" rights of man are the rights of God; and .to vindicate
" the one is to maintain the other. We muft be free, in

Dublin, a fimilar invitation was publifhed by it, and was

The Baronial Committee wu compofed of the fecre.;.
taries, treafurers, and a delegate from each individual fo-
ciety under their direCtion. The County and Provincial.
Committees were to be compofed of the fecretaries, trea-
furers, and a delegate from the Committees immediately
under them.-(Ibid. No. II.) Ireland was fubdivided into
its four Provinces, and its thirty-two Counties; but as foon
as two County Committees were formed, the Provincial
·Committee of that province was to be chofen. When two
Provincial Committees had been eleaed, the National was
formed of five members from each Provincial Committee.
No perfon whatever could mention the names of com-
mittee-men': they were not even known to thofe who had
eleaed them in the cafe of the National or Executive
· Committee, the fecretaries of the Provincial that examined
the ballot only informing the perfons who had the majo-
rity of votes, without reporting to the Eleaors. Thus
was the fociety entirely governed by unlnown Superiors.
When any queftioris were proPC!fed in an inferior fo-
ciety, and this fociety wi£hed to tranfmit them to other
focieties (either to get information on the fubjea, or for
any other reafon) it was to fend them to the committee
under whofe immediate direCtion it might be.
S~ge members. were admitted to the meetings (or, as
they termed'it, " to tht honours of the fitting'') on pro-
ducJng their credentials; but the fecretaries made no re-
turns in their prefence.
A tell: was taken by ·every candidate previous to his
admi1Jion, in a feparate room, in prefence 9.£ his two fpon- ·
fors and of a member delegated by the Mafter for that
purpofe. The te.ft was declared to be " a fodal and fa._
trtd tompall," and was in'the words following: " I, A.B• .

" land. I do farther declare, that neither hopes nor fears;
" rewards nor punHhments, lhall ever induce me, direClly

Dublin, Belfaft, and Ne~ry, were now become the .
head-quarters of the new confpiracy. The latter town ··
even enjoyed the e~clufive privilege of·printing the con-
ftitutions of the alfociation, till by a decree of the 7th De-
~:ember 1796 it was refolved, that they fhould be printed
in three differeat parts of the Kingdom for conveniency's
Jake. A delegate was alfo deputed from thence into the
county of Cavan and the province of Leinfter, where he
founded a number of focieties. The whole county of
Antrim was foon in a ferment; its inhabitants were dif-
fenters, whofe religious tenets bordered on democracy. -
The new-fangled Rights ~f Man began to be the favourite ·
theme of all the difcontented in Europe; Paine's Works
were profufely diftributed among the Iriih; publications
of all forts and fizes were circulated, holding out " lgno•
" r~nce as the demon of difcord- Unum, as power, wif-
" dom, and the road to liberty," and teaching the rifing
brotherh~od " that a more unjuft conftitution could not
" be devifed, than that ~hich condemned the natives of a
" country to perpetual fervitude under the arbitrary do-
" minion of flaves and ftrangers ;-that the fidl: and indif.;.

Tbe ~eans of accomplifuing thefe great things were the
union of the whole peopl4;; ~d England, Scotland, and
Ireland, were fimultaneoufly to raife their voice•. In 1hort,
tbe clergy, gentry, and government, were held out as the
real opprefi'ors of the people ; and thus were all the prin·
cip)es of anarchy and de{\ruelion of property to be infufed
iDto that fame people. Clubs and meetings were held
under various deooQlinations; the Defenders were invited
to u,nite and make a common ~ufe; and the County Com-
.mittees were particularly entrufted with the care of maki.ng

· In future, the bufinefs that will chiefly occupy the
Committees will be reports on men, arms, and money,
which latter article appears to have been a {ubjeCl: of great
contention, Each degree thought itfelf intitled to dif-
pofe of at leaft a part of their funds ; and fuch had been
the law originally; but the High Superiors found it necef-
fary to declare, that no Committee below the County.
O:J.ould be empowered to difpofe of the funds. . Soon after
this power was confined to the Provincial, and ultimately
one of the Executive DireCl:ors always attended at the
Provincial Committee to carry away with him to the Na-
tional Committee whatever C\)ntributiops had been levied
on the brotherhood. The jealoufy of the brotherhood
obliged the National Committee at one time to ilfue
a proclamation, declaring that not '~ one penny of their
money had · bun expended any other way than that it
was intended for." The vigilance of Government great-
ly contributed to augment the expences of the sea,
as many of the members were taken up and brought to
trial, Thefe were defended at the expence of the bro-
therhood. A regular Committee for the defenc~ of pri-
foners travelled the circuits; and the eminent talents of
Mr. Curr~n {employed at a great expence) will ever ftand
a.voucher that juftice was done the prifoners wherever he
was prefent. Large {ums were fubfcribed by all clalfes,
and the duped ·ariftocrats (or, as one of the fecretaries
ftyles them, the Arqftorricks) contributed at one fingle

were expended, and a fafe conveyance had been procured
to the prifoners that were confined in the jail of that
county. This, however, was not the only means of de-
fence devifed; for it was given as the opinion of a County
Committee, " that if there is any United Irilhmen on the
" jury that will commit an_y of the prifoners that is con-
" fined for being United lrilhmen, ought to loft their
cc exifimce." The expences became fo heavy at length,
from buying arms and fupporting and defending prifoners,
that a lottery was fet on foot ; but what reader would fuf-
pea (as was really the fuel:) that this meafure was ob-
jed:ed to, on the plea that it encouraged the immtJrality if

To return to the new military organizati6n of the Sea
It was ordered, that every Baronial Committee lhould
form its three individual focieties into a company rJf one
hundred men, choofmg one captain, two lieutenants, and
five ferjeants; total 108. The reader has already feeq
how exad:ly the correfponding fcale coincided with Weif-
haupt's llluminifm ; but when the military formation be-
gan to take effect:, and the numbers increafed beyond all
expeCl:ation, it was deemed neceffary to extend and change
certain parts of this fcale. Greater danger attending the
taking of arms, the individual focieties began to fplit as
. foon as their n~mbers amounted to twelve. Thefe were
to be near neighbours, the better to watch over each
other's aCl:ions and to enfure fecrecy. The fecretariea
alone were to form the higher committees. They were
the bearers of all ~rders from the higher to the lower
degrees; they reported the progrefs made by, and the views
of, the Sea, in as much as it was thought necefi"ary to let
them into the fecret ; for we find that eveu the County

Committees were not in the fecret as to the nature of the
engagements entered into with the French. What un-
happy deluded people·then were the lower aft"ociators, who .
were informed of nothing, but were to be the mere
agents of rebellion and murder, and.were hurried on into
·this. abyfs of horrors by a few political libertines who
grafped at dominion, and wiihed to wade to the bdm of
tbe ftate through the. blood of their countrymen! Ne-
verthelefs, every petty piece of information that was
tranfmitted to the lower d'egrees was ftyled a lUp.rt t•
their Cl".ffitNtnts.
According to the new (cale it was ordained, that TJnf
lMdividulli S~euties ibould be under the direCtion of one
Baronial Committee; TEN Baroni(!ls to one upper BarD..

Diftriel: Committees, the County Committee was created.
When committees had been appointed in two counties,.
the P.rovincial Committee was formed of two delegates

The captains eleaed the colonels; and the latter pro-
pored three perfons, one of whom was created adjutant-
general by the national committee. It may not be im·
proper here to remark the care with which tbefe higher
confpirators fought to preferve their authority in tlleir own
hands, even in cafe of a revolution ; for when there was a.
quefHon afterward of forming a national a.f!imbly, it was
refolved that each of the thirty-two counties filould depute
one perfon to be added to the executive, all lower focieties
being caft out of the balance, and only to be confidered·as
agents, who~ after having been robbed of every moral and
· civil virtue, were to raife on high their fanguinary chiefs
and feducers, glutted with the blood of the~r lawful go-
tternors.
Here we fee the amazing progrefs made and the. great
power acquir~ fince the 9th of November, 1791. Every
thing now took a ferious and military tum. The new-
cletted oSicers wert inflruatd tojlutl1 taaiu and acqwre
every fpecies of military inrormation with refpcet to roads,
magazines, mills, ~c:. Plans were devifed for the fuppott of
the wives ancl children "tl.uring 1h1 exertions '.[ the Brl•
" thtrhootl in tht fit/d." Every thing that could thwart
government was difcuffed and rcfolved. The confumption
of fpi.rits was pr~ibited, in order to hurt the excife ;
bank-notes were cried dowu; and even the buying of
quit-rents was expretny forbidden. In the mean time the •
High Superiors Caw that this armed mobcould not·becom-
petent ofthemfelves tocope with the king's troops; ameans
of debauching the latter from their allegiance was there-
fore contrived. Hand-bills were privily c:in:ulated, hold-
ing out their ofticers " as tyrants that had rebelled againft
" tbt rights of Wlll, and whofe orders were damnable;"
!tills, in fi;lort, of tbe moft i~atory nature were dif•

perfed among the military by the .towns-people, who were
·charged with the fe<)uCl:ion of the troops of their garrifon.
They fwore-in fome few of the foldiers; thefe fwore
others ; and when their number was fufficient, focieties
were formed in the regiments. Here again we find the
flgn o~d word, which Were.changed every moflth j the
catechifin for recognizing a tr.ue brother; and the oath,
which was, " to be true to the French republic, and to
" tako the life of any man who would attempt to dif-
" cover • ~ •. The rule for reckoning on friends among
the military was, "that in cafe the: perfon fworn is· an
" United Irilhman, and has not taken any aCl:ive fteps
" againft the body or any of its members, out of the line
" of his J#'ofe.ffion, he was to be deemed frill the ·Friend of
" the United lri1hmen."-(Ibid. No. XIY.)- The bet-
ter to propagate the fyftem, it was held out to the military,
" that when the French 1hould come, the foldiers were to
'' be fuch as them; that there were to bt no rich,.but ALL
II ·--- ·- --- - - - -
;: " ~~ALIJ'¥_; and that there was no ufe.in their going
h" againft the French, becaufe when all the Powers wer~
~' againft them, they could make no hand of them•.,
They were alfo tampered with refpeCl:ing their pay.
When all this had fufficiently fucceeded, " a foldier in
~' each company was appointed to make a return of united
'' men in his refpectiv.e company, while two of the
• " fteadieft men"· from each regiment " were employed to
" carry thefe returns" to the towns-people. Thefe, in
return, informed them of the progrefs made by the Sect in
Ireland, and of its numbers on-board the Englijh and
Fr11uh Beet; as alfo of all kinds of news from the lat-
ter. A plan was fettled, " that upon a fignal given, {and
~' this was fetting fire to a houfe, or fome fuch token,) if
"' it was by day light, the men Lhould turn out of the

" trived, an United Irifuman fuould be fentry at the gate,
" who was to fell the barracks; and fuch United lri1h-
" men as were within the barracks were to exert them-
" felves in feizing fuch arms and ammunition within as
" they could get.-lf there were but thilty friends in the
" barracks, by having th~m difperfed up and down in the
" rooms, when the attack W)lS to be made, they could give
" the arms to the towns-people." If any part of the
garrifon were not to be depended upon, the cannonsfeized
were to ,be pointed on the barracks, or whole corps were
to be cut off for refufmg to coalefce with them. Some
of the brotherhood even went fo far as to attempt to fet
fire to the ftores; but the burning coals were luckily dif-
covered by a dragoon. . Such was the plan fo~ garrifons
and towns ; the mode of proceeding in camp is exempli-
fied in that of Bandon: "On the 1ft of July, 1797, the
" country was to be fet on fire on both ends and in the
." middle; and then, with what friends Mr. O'Brien
." near Banddn could fend them, and what friends they
" had in camp, about Four Hundred, they intended firft
~' taking the cannon, and then taking the bell tents, with
~ the fmall arms, which they WOllld give to the country
~ people fent by Mr. O'Brien, and then go put General
~ C11Dit and as many officers as they c11uld to death, and
·'-' retreat to Bantry, take po.lfeffion of the battery, and
~ keep it if poffible till the French would land." Itappeared·
that at a future time, when a rifing was fllfo to have taken
place, that the foldiers were to put all their officers to death,
4nd the yeomanrj alfo if they oppo.fod them. In return for
fo fignal a fervice, the town of Skibbereen was to be
given up to the fo/diers for pillage during eight hours.-

. finiilar view of inflaming the minds of the people. The
violence of his own produCl:ions may be prefumed from the
fentence he paffes on all the moft violent papers of Eng-

The Committees continued to ·receive daily reports of
the motions and determinations oftheir allies, the French;
of their friends in England and in Scotland; and of the
immenfe progrefs that the Sea was making. November,

In M"y, a new fcene opens itfelf, which unfortunately .
fhews us, that the lrilh Brotherhood were no {hangers to
deliberate affaffination. Between the hours of eight md
.nine on ~ Sunday morning, the 7th of May, 1797, a rna!\
of the name of James Dunn {a fmith and farrier, who had
been in Lord Carhampton's fervice for the fpace of fiftec:J\
years, and lived in a houfe at his lordfuip's park•gate} pre•
fented himfelf at a Barb-nial CAmmittu, held in a public-
houfe, Strand-ftreet, Dublin. Maurice Dunn, the keep-
er of the houfe, was his fponfor, and "would engage his
" life for him that he was up orjlraight!' Hereupon
the figns of the Brotherhood were put to him ; and hay~
by his anfwers proved that he was a true and accepted
Brother, the chairman took the chair. James Dunn then
fubmitted to the Society, ''that he and a few more friends

«' becau(e he was a great hindrance to matters getting
" forward." This news elearified the whole committee
with joy. One exclaimed, " It is great news.'' " It is
" glorious news," cried another: " It is the heft news we
" have heard yet," faid a third; and a fourth declared,
that " it would do more for the caufe than had ever been
done before.'' Dunn then mentioned a narrow part of the
road leading to Luttrelftown, and a ftone wall from
whence he might have aflap at Lord Carhampt6n, who he
faid was damned wary, and always carried piftols with
him; but one good blunderbufs would do as much as ten
piflols. He then declared that four friends, John Brode-
rick, Peter Reilly, Patrick Carty, and Ed. Martin, had
engaged to join him; on which the committee named
feven of their members to deliberate on fo important a bu.;.
fmefs, and ordered them to meet at (even o'clock the fame
evening, when Dunn and his companions were to attend.
The cuftomary oath of fecrecy was taken by all prefcnt,
to the number of 17; they then parted, after giving as
the new word " A GOOD ACT." At feven in the evening
the delegated members met, one excepted. · The oath of
fecrecy having been adminitlered to the four friends, they
were introduced. Thomas Byrne then faid, " I fuppof~
" thofe arefriends and gentlemen; I fuppofe we all un:
" derftand what we are met about?"-" If they were
" not," anfwered Dunn, " I would not bring them here.''
-" We know the bufinefs we are met about (fays •
Byrne) ; let us proceed." Various plans were then pro•
pofed for doing his Lordlhip out. Dunn repeated his;
Byrne woulJ have at leaft a party of nine mounted ; but
John Ferraf, with fanguinary zeal, infifted that every per•
fon prefent lhould partake of the foul deed ; and his opi-
nion was adopted. Another refolution propofed by Byrne

then paffed : " that three at leaft fbould go out difguifcd
" with loofe coats an~ blunderbu1fes ; and the refi, as
" yeomen cavalry, to be armed with piftols.'' The plan
of execution was, that " thofe with blunderbu1fes were te
" come at the back of the carrillge and to fire in; thofe
" with the pifl:ols were then to ride on, and fire in at the
'' windows, left the fire from behind lhould not have
" taken effea; and as they pa1fed the footman and pojlillion
" they were alfo to difpatch them ; they were then to r~­
" charge their pieces, ride on in a body towards Dubli~
" and keep together, fo as to fecure their retreat'' A new
oath was then taken, " to be ftaunch and fteady, and true
" to one another in the bufinefs." When the book came
to John Ferra!, he enthufiafiically e~claimed, "If this
c' bufinefs mifies, if provifion be made for my family, I
" will undertake to do him in the ftreets." Several meet.
ings were afterwards held on the fubjeel; for never
was a murder more deliberately planned. Money being
nece1fary for procuring arms, the chairman of the commit-
tee applied to the Baronial Secretary, who referred him to
the Treafurer; and the Sunday after ·(May 14) James
Dunn and Patrick Carty were arrefied in the Phoenix-
park. Carty had; together with his father (a Chelfe:a
penfioner} been a conftant labourer on Lord Carhampton's
·demefne, and had a houfe rent-free. The day after the
arrefi Lord Carhampton vifited Dunn in prifon, in the
hope that he would difcover what was become of t~e
three other alfaffins, but he received QO fatisfaelory anfwer.
On his Lordfhip expreffing his furprize that the prlfoner
lhould be capable of fo atrocious a deed2 the alfaffin anfwer•
ed, that "he thought it was a good all; that he had no
" perfonal diflike to his Lordihip, and viould never execute
" it alone, but with his party ; that be had never fuffered

" any injury from him; but that he was fworn to execute
" it, and if he were out of that (the prifon) he would
" execute it if he could." As to the murdering the poor
innocent pofl:illion, " it was to do the thing completely.''
After this are we to be furprized at the horrid murders
that have taken place. Lord Carhampton, fome time after
the arrcfi: of the fon, had an interview with Carty, the
father, and told him ~'that if his fon would give exami-
" nations he was inclined to let him do fo; and in that·
" cafe he thought his life might be faved; and he defired
" the father would tell the fon fo.'' " The father faid, he.
" was apprehenfive, that if his fon gave examinations, he
" would be murdered." I have dwelt on this example, as
it was the fubjeCl: of a trial, in which the Attorney-Ge-
neral profecuted for the crown, and four counfel attended
on the part of the prifoner, Mr. Curran, Mr. M'Nally,,
Mr. Greene, and Mr. Emmett, who had himfelf been a
member of the Executive OireCl:ory from January till the;

trial will ever fi:amp this as an authentic document.-(See

In June, the captains were informea':, that the national_

It appears on the evidence of John. Hughes (Lords,

Bonham, who was accompanied by Citizen Baily and the

Hughes by ~igley, {aid that he had diftributed moll of

Another principle of that prototype of rebellion had,
unfortunately, b~en too well underftood by the founders
of the Irifu brotherhood, and that was to make them•
felves mafters of the education of youth. Many fchool-

What a melancholy fcene did the feat of fcience
(I mean the Univerfity of Dublin) prefent, when on the
19th, 20th, and 21ft of April, 1798, it appeared on the

~nfulted about providing themfelves with arritS) and flad
elelted officers! Nineteen ftudents were expelled, and
lome other perfons cenfured,- ( Ytjitation h-eld by LtmJ
Clare.)
In the mean time open rebellion continued its progrefs ;
and on the Jft of April it is reported to a committee, that
a letw had been received" from Bartholomew Teeling ••
(executed in September 1798, being taken in arms with
the French in their invafion at Killala} " who was one
" of the delegates in France, ftating, that the French
" troops would moft certainly be on board by the middle
'f of this month. The troops from Breft and that neigh-
" bourhoocl wtre determined to try to evade the Britith
" Beet, and to land in Ireland; of courfe the Britifu fleet
11 would follow th~ ; and while thus drawn off, all the
" other troops embarked at other ports would make a
" defcent on England. Whatever might refult from this
~c attempt, it was the fixed determination of the National
" Committee, in cafe the French 1hould be fruftrated,
" that the brotherhood/hould of themfelves make a ri}ing.
" The citizens of Dublin, it was fuppofed, with the af-
" fiftance of the army, could feize the capital at any
" .moment.'' Unfortunately, the principles of the Sea
had made fuch a progrefs, that as early as February the
returns declared the numbers of the brotherhood to amount
in Ulfter to J 10,990~ in Munfter to 100,634> and in
Leinfter to 68,272; and out of 8,ooo military in Dublin
alone, it was ftated that 3,800 wouid a8 againft Govern-
ment. The Executive proceeded to carry their determin-
;ttion into execution. Dublin, Chapel-izod, the camp and
the government, were to .be feized on at one and the
fame time; and the fignal was to be given to the whole
Ce>l.lntry, by the burning of the mail coac;hes. But, in

order to get poffeftion of the camp at Lehaunftown, the
Mdfrs. Shcares applied to Captain Armftrong, who, true
to his duty (and happily for his country), laid open the
whole of the plan to his commanding oSicer, at wbofe ex-
prefs cldire he continued to commune with the confpira•
tors. He was queA:ioned by them as to the ftrong and
weak fides of the camp; and a Mr. Lawlefs (a furgeon),
with the natural humanity ofthe Sea, obferved, that " the
trees on the right of the camp would be very convenient for
hanging people." At length it was agreed, between the
Meffrs. Sheares (John was a member of the Executive) ·
llOd Captain Armftrong, that the latter fhould " erect a
~ ftandard upon the night to be fixed upon for the attack
" upon the camp, which was to be joined by all whom
" he had previoutly known to be United lri1hmen; that
" na ptrfon was ta Pt Jpartd; and they were not to be
" given the option of joining at the time of the attack."
The camp once carried, and Dublin fallen into the
hands of the confpirators, we may judge of ~ ufe they
meant to make of their victory, by the following palrages
of a proclamation found in the poffeffion of Mr. Henry
Sheares, and in the hand-writing of John Sheares, the
member of the Executive:

WHEN we turn our eyes toward Great Britain, afi'o-

fpirit. Their firft objetl: was, to captivate the minds of(
the people by means of ~' le8ures delivered on ·political (

" clition arid ·rebellion. The molt violent publications I
" to the fame elfetl: were fecretly but generally circulated

that n,e. lefs t~ io.oo.fikes had been ordered for Perth,
befide thofe wanted for Edinburgh. It was farther difco•
vered, that this Watt was a member of the Committu of
Ways and Means ddegated from the remnants of the
conventions that he had in this committee read a plan

common to England as well as to Scotland. Downie, who

infurre8ion of the fleet with an indifferent eye. I here
allude to the papers that appeared on the trial of a man
of the name of Pel/owes, who had been a journeyman
carpenter before he took to the patriotic line; he was
tried at Maidftone on the 13th of March, 1798 (his
trial having been deferred at his own requeft) and fen•
tenced to two years imprifonment. The account of the
tranfa8ion given by the prifoner, as appeared in evidence,
is as follows: " That he lodged at a Mr. W ratten's
" houfe in Maidftone ; that a parcel came there on· the
" rSth of May, 1797 (the fleet in full mutiny) directed.
" to Mr. Wratten, by a Charing-crofs coach. The wife
" opened the parcel ; and, as Mr. W ratten was from home,
" he (Fellowes) told the wife, that the papers it con-
. " tained belonged to one of the focieties; there was to
" be a meeting, he told her, on that night at the Roft
" and Crown ; that he would carry them there, and take
" the fenfe of the meeting. He accordingly did fo; r-ead
" one of them, and none of the fociety made any ob-
. " je8ion. He then laid them on the table, and the
" members of the fociety helped thrmfthm as they thought
" p~;per " (or, perhaps, found them, as was the cafe
with the hand-bills in Scotland). Some of the bills were
carried from this meeting to another divifion of the fo-
ciety, fitting at the Cajlle Inn, under the pretence of
knowing whether they were legal ; but, whether legal or
not, they were diftributed before morning among the fol-
diers then at Maidftone. The paper began thus:-" To

the 31ft of October, 1798, the Covuu boldly declares them to be a.
dumfy fabrication of the minifterial writers. The Englilh nation at large
1hould know that thofe inftructions were never dnubted of by any well
informed perfon, from the firfi feizure of them by Lord Cawdor in Feb.
1797; that they were depofited at the Secretary of State's office; that they
are alluded to in the report made the 9th of May, 1798, by the HouCe of
Commons On tbt trrat"!tnt of prifonm of war, and are pub)ifhed in the
