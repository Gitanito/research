  		              		Experience Description   

    I became increasingly tired over the course of 3 to 4 days and was struggling to breathe.  I  felt heaviness and huge pressure on my chest.   I went to see the specialist and he thought I had bronchitis, since my symptoms were coughing but no pleghm and no fever.  He gave me antibiotics and an injection.  That night I woke up feeling very badly.  I took a bath, thinking that lying in the hot tub would help me to feel better.   I struggled to get to the bathroom because I could hardly move.   I passed out in the bath tub and regained consciousness.   I got out of the tub and struggled to dress myself. On the way  back to my bed, I collapsed.  My husband could not get any reaction out of me, so he  phoned the ambulance.  I came back to life and was taken to the hospital where I stayed for a week in the intensive care unit. After  another few days in the general ward, I was diagnosed with massive bilateral pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in my right leg.
  
  During the time I was unconscious, I saw my spirit rising up from my body.  My spirit was the same form and shape as my body but it looked like smoke.   I sensed that I was in another dimension and experienced peace that surpasses all earthly understanding.   It is a peace that we don’t have or understand here on earth.  We call it peace because it is the only word we have to describe that deep sense of 'peace' that I felt.   I saw a soft, bright light shining deep from my spirit. It was like a white light  that was shining onto me from above.  

  Another light was  next to me on my right hand side.   Somebody was standing there in the shape and form of a human being, but the person was a white light and from the same origin as the White Light I saw in my spirit.    I felt as if a Life Force was drawing me to Him.  I knew it was  God.   Then he was standing next to me. Immanuel  God was with Me and I felt whole and complete in Him.  It was a like a home-coming because   I had been here before.   I knew things without being told. For example, God was standing next to me with a crown made of lapis lazuli and pearls.  I knew the crown was light although the pearls and lapis lazuli were heavy stones.   He also had a white cloak for me in His hands. The white cloak was like a tunic. It   was embroidered with many pearls of different sizes on the front part of the cloak.  There was also another under-cloak for me in His other hand. The color of my cloak was a different mixture between purple and burgundy and was embroidered with very small gemstones. We don’t have that specific color on earth.   I knew the cloak  and the crown were weightless.  I then realized He was there to take me with Him. But in the moment of death, He decided to send my spirit back into my body and I came alive. 
  
  I felt as if I were floating in a bubble of perfect peace for about a month after I came back to life. It was as if I was separated from my body what happened  in the hospital.  I was in perfect peace and never experienced any form of anxiety or fear or stress in that state.
