I hurt my head on a wall. An ambulance took me to the emergency room. 

I was projected to the light and when I came back through the tunnel, I was on the ceiling of the emergency room and I saw a body on the operating room table. I didn't recognize my body right away. I saw the nurses and the doctor taking off their gloves and I then recognized my body and went back into it. I heard the doctor say, 'He is back.' 

It took me over five minutes to come back to full consciousness.
