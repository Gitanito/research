I apparently lost an extreme amount of blood and went unconscious. 

I then remember floating above my body while emergency personnel were working on my body. It was as if the emergency vehicle was cut open and I could see the individuals inside it working on my body. I distinctly remember thinking. 'They are cutting up my favorite pants.' I then saw them apply the defibrillator unit to my chest to jump-start my heart. They tried it once and it did not work; then they tried it a second time, and it was as if I was immediately sucked back into my body, feeling extremely weak. 

The next thing I was aware of was waking up in the hospital in excruciating pain.
