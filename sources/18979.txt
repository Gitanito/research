hello everybody it&#39;s dr steven greer i
wanted to give all of you an update on
what&#39;s actually going on behind the
scenes i&#39;m here in washington right now
after the
congressional hearings on tuesday
and there are quite a few things to
unpack here and i&#39;m i&#39;m here having a
conversation with uh
blake cousins
absolutely thanks for uh
you know this is pretty intense what&#39;s
going on in congress we&#39;re just gonna go
straight to some of the statements that
were made what people need to understand
is that because of the people i&#39;m
working with here in dc i can&#39;t talk in
any specificity but this is the first of
many hearings
it&#39;s not the hearing it&#39;s an
introductory hearing the other thing to
remember is that following the public
hearing that you have access to and i
have here a transcript
of the whole thing
um
there was classified hearing
so you need to understand that in the
public hearings
usually it&#39;s all pretty much
bureaucratic speak and administrative
nonsense
but i think let&#39;s take
five steps back
and look at what really happened on
tuesday what really happened on tuesday
is the equivalent of a a story i&#39;m going
to tell you that i think is very
insightful
and shows how counterintelligence works
some years ago in the 1990s i was
working with a gentleman at the nasa
ames research center and dr richard
haynes
and
i gave him a number of cases
and he eventually wrote a book called
ce5
but he was a research scientist there
and at that time shared a part of a
building with the seti project search
for extraterrestrial intelligence
um
of carl sagan and other fame
and the the top people were in the
building with him and he went up to them
and dr haynes said
also to frank drake
of the drake formula who estimated how
many intelligent civilizations there are
in our galaxy
the drake formula is a calculation of
that
and dr haines says what would you do if
i told you that the seti project
is actually
an operation
counterintelligence operation to make
people think that we&#39;re looking for
something when you know
we&#39;ve already had them land on the earth
and that you&#39;re using radio telescopes
to look for
objects and civilizations that aren&#39;t
using
that antiquated 1800s technology
and this senior scientist turned to dr
haynes and said
well dick i&#39;d say that you&#39;re a very
smart man
so
what these what this hearing was
and if you look at it in its totality
rather than getting lost in the weeds
you come to across with with with these
this opening concept
that the pentagon has only collected 400
cases
to investigate
well of course there were several
thousand cases
in the project grudge and project blue
book in the 50s and 60s
the the idea that the people sitting
there have zero historical knowledge
of a ufo phenomenon that&#39;s been going on
for over 100 years since the late 1800s
is
not
conceivably possible
so you have to begin to ask the bigger
question of is
are they completely ignorant of the
facts
which given that these are
you know government bureaucrats is
possible
or
were they uh
doing basically what they did with the
seti project and say here we&#39;re starting
from fresh
we really don&#39;t know anything about this
and deliberately making it appear to
congress and the american people in the
media
that there&#39;s no pre-existing body of
evidence
that has been run to ground thoroughly
over the last 70 years
now you don&#39;t have to go far to look at
that
anyone who can read there&#39;s a 500 and
some page book called disclosure that
are the edited transcripts of several
dozen top secret military personnel and
government documents
that we published in 2001
as 21 years ago
uh in advance of the national press
conference uh disclosure project
uh there are other archives around the
world in private hands but also in
government hands that i&#39;m aware of
i have people on my team who&#39;ve been in
classified vaults
where there are literally hundreds of
thousands of pages of documents on this
as well as the
reverse engineering of extraterrestrial
vehicles etc now these two witnesses uh
bray and moultrie
they either are
similar to chris mellon
either
deliberately keeping themselves ignorant
of the fact the willful blindness has
call it or they&#39;re lying
you only have two choices here this was
under oath
so if you&#39;re going to be
called under oath
if you have that information have access
to even a cursory review
of existing
material in the public domain never
minding these classified
compartmented operations that
people on my team have seen and been in
then you know you can&#39;t have it both
ways you&#39;re either completely ignorant
and a very poor researcher in which case
you should not writ large be testifying
as an authority figure in front of
congress or number two you are a part of
a deception
these are your only two
choices
there aren&#39;t any other choices
for people like chris mellon and these
guys because you either know
and you&#39;re not telling the truth
and withholding information
or
you don&#39;t know in which case that would
make you the most
poorly informed person
ever to be tasked with researching a
subject of any type
in the government or elsewhere
so that&#39;s that&#39;s let&#39;s set the stage
with that
the other thing to remember is that the
real investigation that&#39;s going on
is going on underneath those guys
what i mean by underneath is going on
more quietly subrosa
is going on in a way where they have
already confirmed
and answered many of the questions posed
in the hearing that these folks said
they had no information on
that i know
for a personal fact
personal fact direct
so
this hearing
uh is is something people have to begin
to to really look at it from a you know
this sort of big picture view
of where does it fit now what i&#39;m hoping
and what i&#39;ve been told by my sources
who are very high up in the intelligence
community and what have you
is that there&#39;ll be many others that
this is the beginning of a process
but with that said uh anyone listening
that&#39;s why i&#39;m doing this tonight
is
you really cannot erode further
confidence and faith and trust
in the government of the united states
by putting on something like what
happened tuesday it&#39;s erosive
to public trust because anyone who
look 750 million people have seen our
documentary unacknowledged which is
chock full of cases military witnesses
documents evidence
that
is
it&#39;s an hour and 42 minutes
same thing with above top secret
and are the books we have unacknowledged
and disclosure
those four things alone
would have answered almost all the
questions asked in this hearing
and those are in the public domain and
literally
millions and millions of people have
seen them
so what happens is when
congress holds a hearing like this
and it&#39;s someone oh my team called it a
dumpster fire
and it ends up being what you saw and if
you get the transcript i recommend
people get the transcript and read it
and we&#39;re going to go through it today
what happens is that my bigger concern
is that it makes a laughing stock
out of the government and its
investigatory capabilities when i know
for a fact there are very very very good
people who are doing investigation and
who have hit pay dirt
uh so i think that they better get all
on the same page and stay out of the
public eye
until they&#39;re willing to tell the truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth and if you&#39;re
under oath you damn well better do that
because you&#39;re you&#39;re rushing up against
um perjury federal perjury risk
not two so that&#39;s that&#39;s you know uh
some just introductory remarks i wanted
to make the other thing i wanted to
point out is in the opening few seconds
the
the chairman of the committee uh mr
carlson
used the term national security threat
and that terminology came up with by my
account of the transcript about eight
times
now the problem with that is that let&#39;s
take another
way step back
from the 1940s forward
this issue should have never
underscored
been primarily
led by military and intelligence folks
it should have been the scientific
community
nasa
uh and other concerned entities
because once it falls into the black pit
of classified military intelligence and
military operations but more importantly
the old saying if you&#39;re a hammer the
whole world looks like a nail
so if you&#39;re a military in your mindset
everything that happens out there you
don&#39;t understand you&#39;re going to see it
as a threat when it isn&#39;t
now the other part of it is that there
is a big threat
but they&#39;re presenting this national
security threat
as something from external
with the implication it might be
extraterrestrial or it might be another
country or china
in reality the people i&#39;m working with
have concluded as we have over the last
30 years since i first briefed
the president and the ci director
clinton&#39;s the ci director
that the national security threat is
from the secrecy now go back and look at
my books and also unacknowledged
the documentary it&#39;s on amazon prime and
2b and youtube and see it everywhere for
free
it
has in there a document signed by the
first
director of the cia admiral roscoe
hellinketer
in a letter he wrote to the new york
times where he states
the secrecy surrounding this issue is a
threat to the national security
now that was written i believe in 1961
all right so we&#39;re talking 61 years ago
almost two-thirds of a century
this dot this letter is not in dispute
so
here we are starting as if we&#39;re
beginning at zero where they hit the
reset button like they did with project
blue book and pretend like we&#39;re
starting from scratch
and this is why
we&#39;re assembling and we need everyone&#39;s
help on this anyone listening who&#39;s a
serious
researcher
we&#39;re putting together the largest
archives on ssds solid state hard drives
that will be used by these investigators
who are sincerely trying to find the
answers
and then and i am then personally
currying them and handing them off to
those people
so anyone out there who has documents
legitimate photos
video
testimony whistleblowers actual
intelligence they need to get that to us
in the next two weeks
because this train has really already
left the station
and the reason that&#39;s important
is that there has to be
a
extensive open source archive
that both members of the us government
such as members of congress the
presidential staff the national security
council
the white hats the good guys that are in
the pentagon and cia and they exist
as well as the american public can
access
that would have everything that is
legitimate now we are putting that
together it&#39;s a huge task i have a team
right now flying around
uh collecting a lot
but we need more and you can&#39;t have too
much
so that&#39;s a request at the very
beginning
because i think that this is a public
um you know a private public government
initiative to try to get
the people who are responsible for
overseeing the us government
uh read in
briefed properly
and quite clearly you saw what happened
uh
at this hearing
the members of congress learned
virtually nothing there were a few
administrative
and organization and bureaucratic you
know
things discussed
but there was nothing of any substance
whatsoever that was revealed
and that&#39;s ridiculous
and yet with all the hype and ballyhoo
that that should never happen because i
think there are too many when you look
at the us
the last polls that were done 55 to 65
percent of the u.s population
know that ufos are real and believe that
some are from extraterrestrial origin
so when you have a hearing like this
that&#39;s so widely watched
that undermines the faith and trust and
credibility of the us government i think
it&#39;s very counterproductive for
democracy
well since
also that they were
wanting to kill the messenger in regards
to some of the
some of the private research groups like
ourselves yourselves trying to
spread the word on this and they were
bringing up a really provocative
statement that got my eyebrows kind of
raised when they&#39;re talking about if
there&#39;s any ramifications legally that
they could do to people that go against
the narrative let&#39;s let&#39;s roll this clip
real quick sure
uh obviously this topic of uaps uh has
attracted a lot of interest in in people
that are
um
curious about uh this this hearing today
as we talk about um
and i would say there&#39;s a lot of what i
would call uh amateur interest groups uh
that are involved in the uap field
mike my question is when there are
unsubstantiated claims or manufactured
claims of uaps or
kind of false information that&#39;s put out
there
what are the consequences for people
that are involved with that or groups
that are involved with that
so one of the concerns that we have is
that
there are a lot of
individuals and groups that are are
putting information out there that
that could be considered to be somewhat
self-serving
uh we&#39;re trying to do what&#39;s in the
what&#39;s in the best interest of one the
department of defense and then two
what&#39;s in the best interest of the
public to ensure that we can put factual
based information back into the
mainstream and back into the bloodstream
of the reporting uh media that we have
so people understand what&#39;s there
it&#39;s important because we are attempting
um as this hearing as has drawn out to
understand
one what may just be natural phenomenon
to what may be sensor phenomenology or
things that were happening with censors
three
what may be legitimate counter
intelligence threats to
places that we have or bases or
installations or security threats to our
platforms and anything that diverts us
off of what we have with the resources
that have been allocated to us send us
off in these spurious
chases and hunts that are just not
helpful and they also helped whether
they also contribute to the undermining
of the confidence that the congress and
the american people have that we are
trying to get to the root cause of
what&#39;s happening here report on that and
then feed that back into our national
security apparatus so we are able to
protect the american people and our
allies so it is harmful it is hurtful
but hopefully if we get more information
out there we&#39;ll start to lessen the
impact of some of those spurious reports
so just taking that a step further so
though that misinformation false
narratives manufactured so what are the
consequences are there legal
consequences are there examples that you
can give us where people have been held
accountable by this misinformation or
disinformation i can&#39;t give you you know
any examples where somebody&#39;s been
legally held liable for putting
something out there but well i guess
what&#39;s the deterrent from people
engaging in this activity yeah
i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know i i don&#39;t have that
answer i that&#39;s something that uh you
know welcome to dialogue with congress
to talk about that with the members who
uh you know help legislate those laws so
it seems that they want to attack the
second amendment
with the ufo phenomenon and they&#39;re
going to use that maybe to mess with our
rights it was pretty much loud and clear
that they want to maybe even change or
ask congress to change laws
yes i think that that was brought up by
a member of congress not by the uh
you know people testifying
but i think you know that
opens this larger question of
uh who&#39;s watching the watchers who&#39;s
watching the the the secret programs
and when they&#39;re
above top secret
when people i&#39;ve met with like ci
directors like admiral wilson like the
people now who are in charge of the
black budget of the united states and
they get denied access to projects we
can prove exist and have now gotten them
information so they can get in
you cannot
undermine that by threatening to
criminalize
private investigations on something like
this and i want to go back what you&#39;re
saying is very important because there&#39;s
this tendency right now
all over the united states towards
totalitarianism censorship
um the infringement of free speech etc
and so on very dangerous
uh it&#39;s the worst i&#39;ve seen in my
lifetime this in the last five years now
this was the the reference here was even
saying are there laws
that we could criminalize say for
example what everyone&#39;s been doing who&#39;s
worked with me on the disclosure project
that&#39;s very worrisome um and uh
hopefully you know that doesn&#39;t go any
further than it being asked as a
question and then
vaguely answered by the witnesses they
really uh didn&#39;t say too much about it
honestly if you look at their answers
but
uh it is it&#39;s a red flag i agree with
you but i think more importantly
is
you cannot criminalize an investigation
or the disclosure of evidence materiel
whistleblower testimony government
documents no matter how many stamps they
have on them top secret
if the entity
that is keeping it secret
is itself a criminal organization
and remember this was the assessment we
reached in the mid 1990s
it&#39;s why we wrote that unless otherwise
directed letter
which is what you write to agencies when
you&#39;re when you say to the military
unless i&#39;m told otherwise unless
directed otherwise
we&#39;re our assessment is that these
projects
are illegal
unconstitutional and rogue therefore
anybody can come forward with documents
from any base materiel
top secret witness testimony and no
prosecution persecution
criminality is attached to that act
because the organization that is holding
all of that is lying to the president
lying to congress lying to the oversight
people in the pentagon who have a need
to know and
i can prove this in a court law every
word i just said i can prove in a court
of law therefore
you cannot criminalize people who
disclose
illegal operations
because by definition if the operation
is illegal
it is
a priori
uh not protected by the law it&#39;s like if
someone was running a mafia
storefront
and someone broke when they said oh you
know i&#39;m gonna have you arrested because
you broke into my illegal operation well
they can&#39;t do that
you can&#39;t do that
you know contract law and and just basic
uh
legal theory if an organization is
criminal and illegal which this
organization keeping this issue secret
at this level is
they&#39;ve opted out of the law so they
can&#39;t then turn around and use the law
to prosecute persecute
penalize people who come forward
that we put forward in the 1990s and by
the way
from 1997
98 we put a 60-day timer on it
no one since that time has ever
approached me
in the us government and said you were
wrong about this
and
because i know i could prove in a court
of law i&#39;m right i&#39;ve met with too many
people over the last 30 years
cabinet-level people
top people at the
cia pentagon but also in congress on
oversight committees since the 90s i&#39;ve
been meeting with people and in the
early 2000s who were senate intelligence
and house government oversight
none of those people
had been read into the subject all of
them even when they made inquiries were
brushed off or threatened
the way admiral wilson was
so i think people need to understand
that an organization that behaves that
way
is no longer protected by the laws of
the united states or any other country
they operate in in in this fashion in an
illegal fashion
this concerning just uh the language
that was brought up and uh we&#39;re looking
at it very closely another thing that
caught my attention
was the
off-world material or material that&#39;s
been recovered and
one of the eyewitnesses basically stated
straight up that there is no
evidence recovered one way or the other
what&#39;s your thoughts on that we&#39;ll run
the clip
uh when it comes to material that we
have we have no material
we have detected no emanations
within the uap task force that that is
uh that would suggest it&#39;s anything
non-terrestrial uh in origin so there&#39;s
um when i say unexplained i mean
everything from too little too little
data
to we simply the data that we have
doesn&#39;t point us towards an explanation
but we&#39;ll go wherever the data takes us
again we&#39;ve made no assumptions about
what this is or isn&#39;t uh we&#39;re committed
to understanding these and so we&#39;ll go
wherever that data takes us
thank you that&#39;s that&#39;s very helpful
until i think it bears emphasis when you
say we can&#39;t explain everything that you
can&#39;t explain
is in a bucket called data
is that correct and that would mean uh
data collected by sensors visual
observations everything that we can&#39;t
explain quote-unquote is in a bucket
called data right a narrative report uh
from uh from the early 2000s if it just
had a little bit of information on it
would be in our database and it would be
unresolved i would add to that it&#39;s
insufficient data i mean that&#39;s one of
the challenges we have insufficient data
either on the event itself the object
itself or insufficient data or plug-in
with some other organization or agency
that may have had something in that
space at that time so it&#39;s a data issue
that we&#39;re that we&#39;re facing in many of
these instances congressman understood
thank you very much yield back so you
just heard it uh nothing recovered off
world or otherwise mundane stuff if
anything
well you see this is another huge
problem either
these two witnesses have not been read
into those projects
which is possible
uh maybe they&#39;re the people underneath
them that are penetrating those
operations or giving them plausible
deniability in advance of this hearing
to keep them in the dark
i mean washington operates that way
or
they&#39;re lying under oath
so again i get back to my opening
comment there is so much abundant
evidence and testimony direct
first-hand testimony and even documents
that are top secret that we&#39;ve gotten
about the retrieval of such material and
the study of it there are reams and
reams of information on this that i&#39;ve
been providing and and giving heads up
to
these investigators where they&#39;re
located
where the skiffs the secure
communication information facilities are
and the deep underground military bases
the dumbs
are located that are holding this
materiel
and
they now know
now whether or not these two witnesses
have had the people under them
or in other parts of the government not
read them in on that
it&#39;s possible i have not had a
conversation with either
of these two witnesses but if they don&#39;t
know well that&#39;s a complete failure of
of
being a proper manager
and a proper leader and an administrator
and then why are they being called in
front of congress to testify at all
but if they do know and they have been
read into this then they light under
oath
and and that&#39;s
of course a federal criminal evidence
so it&#39;s basically sci sensitive
compartmentalized information and we
don&#39;t know maybe these two um witnesses
don&#39;t have access to some of these
other
projects that are above top secret so
either there&#39;s possible yeah so but but
there are people there are people
working
underneath them who are hooked into that
system i&#39;m dealing with so
the question is where is the breakdown
on intelligence or and if there is one
then they need to fix it before they go
in front of the congress and the
american people again
or
there&#39;s a there&#39;s a problem with
deception happening
but you don&#39;t have any other choices on
this
you know and there&#39;s a statement that
was interesting where they said that
they there&#39;s an authoritative that they
answered to but we didn&#39;t get that
person&#39;s name and who&#39;s that
authoritative uh let&#39;s bring up another
statement about
the
the uh the uap phenomenon whether the
military has engaged them with any kind
of firepower or have they engaged them
militarily and again there was a
reaction said that there was none
whatsoever
have we engaged
in military action against uh the uap as
far as some of the information you&#39;ve
received let&#39;s listen to the clip and
let&#39;s kind of body language this
so we don&#39;t we don&#39;t even put out a
alert saying you know uh us um
identi you know identify yourself
uh you are you know within our flight
path or something like that we we
haven&#39;t said anything like that
we&#39;ve not put anything out like that
generally speaking uh what you know for
example in the video that we showed
earlier uh it appears to be something
that is uh you know unmanned uh appears
to be something that
may or may not be in controlled flight
and so we&#39;ve not attempted any
communication with that
okay so um
and i assume we&#39;ve never discharged any
armaments against a uap correct
that&#39;s correct
so there you go they&#39;re not they&#39;re
admitting that we haven&#39;t shot again is
this uh
information that they&#39;re not privy to
well again that&#39;s a completely false
statement
um it&#39;s demonstrably false we have the
testimony of merle shane mcdowell who
was at the atlantic command underneath
the sink atlantic command of admiral of
harry train
when we scrambled jets in the early
1980s and fired on
a
ufo off the coast of newfoundland that
was on five radar stations we scrambled
jets
fighter jets who did fire on it but we
did not successfully down it
and he is on the record and we have
other
events where there&#39;s documentation
and top secret military personnel in the
disclosure project let me go to my
youtube channel and you&#39;ll see we have
people like us
others who have actually been on
retrieval teams i just presented this
new top secret witness who was in the
2000s was on a retrieval team
uh
recovering both uh extraterrestrial but
also man-made ufos
that were
roughly triangular that were
electromagnetic field propulsion devices
and all of that we presented at the
conference last month in in arizona in
which that information has also been
handed off to the government
investigators
so uh there are many many many cases
like this over the years in fact
thousands of cases
uh where this has happened and so for
these people to say they have no
knowledge of anything anyone who would
would just do a cursory review of the
ufo literature that is out there in the
public domain would know that that is a
false statement but again
and i&#39;m not trying to just dump on
government people all the time but
you know i don&#39;t i&#39;ve seen enough just
utter
slacker incompetence
in government that it&#39;s feasible it&#39;s
possible
that these people have not gotten any of
that information but if that&#39;s the case
they need to be replaced with someone
who at least knows how to read
the case files and evidence that are
extant that are freely available from
very credible sources so
um now i think the way they couched it
though is that
i don&#39;t have any in other words
the the very narrow scope of this sort
of dog and pony show
which is acting like we&#39;re basing
everything we know on this on these 400
cases that they keep citing when of
course
in the u in the literature
there are over 4 000 aircraft encounter
cases and radar cases already
there are numerous of them
such as mr callahan and the japan
airlines event and i have the radar tape
and military jets were scrambled to
alaska for that event if you read our
material
then you have this whole question of
well
uh
there are 3500 cases where these objects
have landed
and left physical evidence like at the
air force base in england at randallshim
forest the bentwaters case
there are 3 500 of those cases
there are all the crash retrieval cases
that lynn stringfield documented and
that other people my team have
documented
so it&#39;s very hard for me to imagine that
you&#39;re running a multi-million dollar
office
now remember
the disclosure project and all this that
you&#39;ve seen us collect
have been done without professional
investigators
people working for free
no offices and no paid staff
now i&#39;m supposed to believe as a medical
doctor and a scientist
that somebody with tens of millions of
dollars in their budget
and the firepower they have in terms of
investigation and research that all of
this that we&#39;re talking about is off
their radar
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mind-blowing it&#39;s it&#39;s
mind-boggling so again you&#39;re either
dealing with the most ill-informed
people in the history of this subject
or people who are
advancing some other false misdirect
where they&#39;re saying well we&#39;re just
starting out this is all new to us we
don&#39;t know anything
and that is completely got to be false i
mean now
these guys who are new onto the scene
maybe they haven&#39;t done their homework
yet
but if you haven&#39;t done your homework
and prepared
why would you be testifying under oath
with the whole world watching in front
of a relevant member of the house
intelligence committee i mean this is
you know this is a real disconnect here
and i think it erodes uh faith and
confidence in the u.s government
well it&#39;s embarrassing actually when
they&#39;re trying to present the ufo
evidence and it took them about five
minutes and they actually failed to even
show whatever the object was which was
pretty pathetic that&#39;s the best they
have we obviously know they got better
especially the public
has the information
yeah as you say just independent
is no budget and
you&#39;re bringing presenting more evidence
in what congress did again another thing
that caught my attention was
their lack of information or knowledge
like you say in regards to the
maelstrom
uh incident where the congressman was
asking them to do an investigation on it
or if they know anything about it and
here&#39;s a clip it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of
quite telling here let&#39;s watch
yep
it&#39;s also been reported uh that there
have been uap observed uh and
interacting with and flying over
sensitive military facilities
particularly not just ranges but uh some
facilities housing our strategic nuclear
forces one such incident allegedly
occurred
at malmstrom air force base in which 10
of our nuclear icbms were rendered
inoperable at the same time a glowing
red orb was observed overhead i&#39;m not
commenting on the accuracy of this i&#39;m
simply asking you whether you&#39;re aware
of it and whether you have any comment
on the accuracy of that report we passed
that to mr brave you&#39;ve been looking at
uaps over the last three years that data
is not uh within the holdings of the uap
task force
okay but are you aware of the the report
or that the data
exists somewhere
i i have uh
i have heard stories i have not seen the
official data on that so you&#39;ve just
seen informal stories no official
assessment that you&#39;ve done or exists
within dod that you&#39;re aware of uh
regarding the malmstrom incident
all i can speak to is you know what&#39;s
within my cognizance the uap task force
and we have not looked at that incident
well i was i missed a pretty high
profile incident uh i i don&#39;t claim to
be an expert on this but that&#39;s out
there in the ether
you&#39;re you&#39;re the guy&#39;s investigating it
i mean who else is doing it if something
was officially brought to our attention
we would look at it there are many
things that are out there in the ether
that aren&#39;t officially brought to our
attention how would it have to be
officially brought to you i&#39;m bringing
it to you
this is pretty official sure so we&#39;ll go
back and take a look at it but generally
there is some um authoritative figure
that says there is an instant that
occurred we&#39;d like you to look at this
but in terms of just tracking what may
be in the media that says that something
occurred at this time at this place
they&#39;re probably a lot of leads that we
would have to follow up on i don&#39;t think
we were resourced to do that right now
well i don&#39;t claim to be an
authoritative figure but for what it&#39;s
worth i would like you to look into it
for another reason you could dismiss it
and say this is not worth wasting
resources on um so there there we go no
knowledge i guess he&#39;s gonna look into
it now that it was brought up by the
congressman but isn&#39;t it interesting
that these guys are the ones in charge
and again no knowledge of some of these
famous cases
well it&#39;s not famous cases but in the
disclosure project we have the testimony
of people who were there
we have other people who are at norad
who saw the transcript of the event and
we have the official government
documents of that case it&#39;s in the
disclosure book
now i always keep saying this because
everyone nobody reads anymore
but if you read that book and you can
just get it on you get it online get our
store
those government documents and
first-hand government witnesses who were
in the command center in one instance
and in the silo in another
that&#39;s we put that out there 21 years
ago
and it happened
way before then
so again if you are doing a serious
research on this subject
and again this is
information in the public domain that
millions of people have seen
and you&#39;re there testifying in front of
the congress
and
saying you have no knowledge of a case
like that for which there are
government insider testimony and
official uncontested
government documents about it
then
my god you know this person needs to go
to kindergarten on the ufo issue before
they start testifying before a house
intelligence committee panel
you know again
the lack of knowledge
i think it&#39;s interesting to note because
they only want to hit on the evidence
from 2004 and up and not really hitting
on any of the evidence prior to that and
basically they&#39;re not looking at all the
bulk of
incred incredible evidence cooperating
because it&#39;s probably too smoking gun
for them that&#39;s where it&#39;s all at they
want to kind of just go on with the tic
tac which obviously i think we have our
own opinions on what the tic tac is you
think that&#39;s deliberate
i do i mean i think that it&#39;s either
someone is keeping them out of the
information
nexus
you know all the the
available information or there&#39;s willful
blindness where
don&#39;t tell me about that it&#39;s better if
i don&#39;t know so that i can be a
mouthpiece to go up to congress or to
the national security council or to the
president and
honestly without lying say i don&#39;t know
anything
and and i think that so there&#39;s some
kind of nonsense going on here
and that needs to get corrected they
need to uh become
uh
more professional and educated on the
subject before they sit in front of a uh
congressional hearing and in front of
the american public and american
media you also brought up to my
attention that there was a portion that
you probably
thought was quite interesting in regards
to wilson the admiral wilson files where
yes pretty much very important i think
that was the most important thing of the
whole hearing let&#39;s uh let&#39;s listen to
that clip real quick
yeah are you aware of a document that
appeared around 2019 uh sometimes called
the admiral wilson memo or ew notes memo
i am i am not you&#39;re not are you trying
i&#39;m not personally aware of that okay
this is a document in which again i&#39;m
not commenting on the veracity i was
hoping you would help me with that in
which a former head of dia claims to
have had a conversation with the doctor
eric wilson and claims to have uh sort
of been made aware of certain
contractors or dod programs um that he
tried to get fuller access to and was
denied
access to um so you&#39;re not aware of that
i&#39;m malware congressman i think this uh
this question
was very important and unfortunately
again you know the people answering
didn&#39;t have any knowledge of it now
remember admiral wilson
this memo they&#39;re referring to is a
a debriefing of the admiral
by
this gentleman and it was leaked out of
edgar mitchell&#39;s archives after he
passed away
but it was about the meeting i
had with admiral wilson who is the head
of intelligence j2
for the joint chiefs of staff
and this is 25 years ago this is 1997
april 1997
and of course in that admiral wilson
admits
this is not in the in the transcript of
course the questions and answers
that he had found out about this
clandestine
beyond black above top secret group
but had been threatened with the motion
and and more
uh for if he didn&#39;t back off of the
inquiries
now remember
that his inquiries about this happened
after we provided enough actionable
intelligence to him
uh through channels
courier
prior to the meeting and at the meeting
of course i brought astronaut edgar
mitchell there
so he could learn he really didn&#39;t have
any information on the subject way back
then
but also i had my military advisor and a
military witness
um whistleblower and uh my assistant
sherry adamec so that was going to be a
45 minute stand up briefing it went on
for i think nearly three hours
the admiral kept canceling
appointments because
it was so much information being
provided
but
prior to the meeting
we had courier over him
a cache
of documents government documents that
had not been declassified
that had project code names and code
numbers on it and other information and
based on that just like we&#39;re doing now
with with people in washington today
with this new investigation
they were able he was able as as a head
of intelligence joint staff
to locate the offices
and the operations
excuse me the operations responsible for
handling this issue
and
but when he did
and he started kept pushing on it
he was a threatened and it says so in
this transcript
the the memo about admiral wilson making
his inquiries the other thing that&#39;s in
that memo are the names of the offices
if you read it carefully
that he had found had operations
that were in these rogue and clandestine
projects
now the reason that is so important and
this is i said this some years after he
left that command
is that it&#39;s another exhibit this
exhibit
why in all the meetings i&#39;ve had with
people who absolutely if these projects
were being run legally
constitutionally
absolutely would have been read into and
certainly
not been threatened by a bunch of thugs
which is what happened to the ci
director woolsey which happened to the
president which happened to
on the list goes on and on and on and on
i&#39;ve recently found
and this is breaking news
that
many of you know about what we call the
christopher cox memo
and congressman cox was an orange county
republican with whom
i met
many years ago when he was the
representative from orange county
to the congress
he later became w bush&#39;s
sec chairman
security exchange commission
but at the time when he was congressman
he was interested in this and he was on
the house
science committee and technology
committee
so i briefed him
on this
personally for some time and at the end
of the meeting he says well i have never
been read into any of this and i&#39;m on a
number of committees
and
where are these facilities
and where are these
uh
bases and what corporations i will say
so some of them are in your district
under your nose
so i created the cox memo which has been
in all the presidential briefing
materials and has also been handed off
to this current iteration of
investigations that are going on here in
washington right now
but we keep expanding it as we get more
intelligence
but the original cox memo
and its update and all of that kind of
information
resulted in him
congressman cox
finding out enough that he was a couple
of
goons in black
showed up and threatened to kill him and
his entire family
if he didn&#39;t back off and stop asking
questions about this i learned this from
a friend a personal friend of the
congressman
about a month ago
so i think that
you know this is another pattern
where you have government officials who
have a need to know
you have pentagon senior admiral
generals flag officers with a need to
know you have cabinet level secretaries
and ci directors with a need to know and
you have presidents all of whom we can
prove have been either denied access or
threatened worse
by this organization
that is prima facie evidence of a
criminal conspiracy so this is not a
conspiracy theory there are real
conspiracies like iran contra or the
mafia
so we&#39;re talking here
criminal activity and the fact that
as much publicity as there has been on
that leaked memo from admiral wilson and
from the briefing we did
for the neither of these gentlemen to
have any knowledge of it
again it&#39;s such a failure of either
themselves or their staff
and it&#39;s quite possible they don&#39;t know
then in which case what&#39;s happening here
is that these figureheads going up in
front of the congress
there have to be people on their team
keeping them out of the loop
that are keeping them in the dark
because no one can be this inept a
cursory google search
of this subject would bring up admiral
wilson&#39;s experience and what happened to
him that&#39;s referenced in in this memo
that very
surprisingly to me a member of congress
actually knew about but if a member of
congress knew about it
how can
this senior figure bray at the office of
naval intelligence and moultrie who are
tasked with this issue have no knowledge
of it you know this is again
it either screams
incompetence and ignorance or
cover-up
neither is very good i think because i
think
uh the american people deserve better
the members of congress who are
sincerely trying to get to the bottom of
this
deserve better
i think they actually watched our
documentary that we worked together on
above top secret due to the fact that
we&#39;re calling out the major media by
them sharing these obvious cgi
application phone apps showcasing fake
ufos including the famous corbell video
that they&#39;ve been pushing for a couple
years
and they actually had to go back and
debunk it but what&#39;s interesting the
news is still praising jeremy corbell
for his name being mentioned but did
they fail to hear that they debunked his
video and they continued to show this
uh again very i but i think that&#39;s also
here let me comment on that
i think that that has been done
deliberately so that all triangular
craft
are dismissed as drones that have been
filmed improperly
so this then takes out of consideration
it&#39;s a way if if they if they push a
false piece of evidence like that and
it&#39;s later proven to be
a misperception etc and so on
by extension this is again psychological
warfare people go oh all those
triangular objects are just
poorly filmed versions of a conventional
drone
and when that&#39;s not the case at all
so i think that this
i i don&#39;t i&#39;m not so sure that that&#39;s
not deliberate
because if you look at the
the the
documents we have from the 1950s and the
robertson panel cia
they talked about engaging
groups
to throw pie pans in the air
and take pictures of them
and then so that they look like a flying
saucer quote unquote so that then the
astronomers and people like dr menzel
who was on the payroll the cia or the
professor at harvard could go forward
and say oh see this one&#39;s an obvious
fake therefore all of these disc shaped
objects that have been photographed are
faked
see this is i want people to listen
carefully about how counterintelligence
operates
they&#39;re very good at what they do and
i&#39;m not so sure that the pushing and
pushing and pushing of this poor video
uh from four bell
is was had that as sort of a underlying
purpose
even still
because then people say they&#39;ll just
dismiss anything
that&#39;s triangular when there are many
triangular shaped man-made
uh
electromagnetic field propulsion devices
and there are e.t ones
that are triangular by the way
there are both
and i think that you know this is
something that any solid researcher
knows about but you know even before
that happened
there was an interesting at 31 minutes
there was this dialogue
um
30 to 31 minutes with moultrie
uh talking about their sensor systems
and it is
incredibly off the mark now maybe in the
classified briefing he talked about it
but you know that
back many years ago i met with a man who
was an electronics genius
who invented neutrino light detectors
and these are detectors that beginning
in the 1970s
early 70s were put on
the uh satellites the classified
satellites to detect
and sense with their sensors
uh et craft
coming in from outer space where they
then go from one you know a higher
frequency
um resonance into three dimension you
know because they&#39;re trans-dimensional
vehicles and when they begin to
materialize quote-unquote there&#39;s this
burst of neutrino light and then they
can track them target them and attempt
to knock them down or capture them
so that is now almost 50 years on
so
now i can&#39;t speak to what happened in
the classified uh briefings i haven&#39;t
gotten that information yet
um i&#39;m sure i will but i think that the
issue is
uh
there there are much better sensor
systems than are being talked about and
so the public needs to understand
however that the top investigators
currently
who do manage the black budget of the
united states and do manage
the nro and and the three letter
agencies
they have net until i met with them they
had never been read into the neutrino
light detector system
okay
so it you know again this is the problem
you&#39;re dealing with extraordinary levels
of secrecy that becomes so extreme they
become illegal
because then there are people who
by all
right of law and
order
should know about a technology like that
i just described have no knowledge of it
so i just want i wanted to bring that up
because this whole discussion that went
on for some time about their censors and
what have you
uh it wouldn&#39;t surprise me
if these two gentlemen had not been read
into these more advanced detection
systems
as we watched this hearings it was
almost like a
going to preschool or kindergarten as in
regards to some of their knowledge that
they brought forward
again
they&#39;re trying to protect their
sensitive
assets in regards to protecting our
national security against adversaries
but they did they failed to mention that
there was any kind of cover-up of the
ufo phenomenon that it doesn&#39;t even
exist that there&#39;s any kind of cover-up
and
again you say there&#39;s there&#39;s going to
be new hearings we haven&#39;t heard that
publicly but from what you&#39;re telling us
is that more hearings are going to
proceed are we going to expect anything
better
in the future is it going to still go
down this road or are we bringing well
by having that discussion
i think this is strategic
let me let&#39;s talk about this for a
minute
and this is a problem i&#39;m facing with
the people i i deal with all the time
here
how do you bring people
to from zero knowledge
up to full
knowledge it&#39;s enormous i mean there is
serious i call it disclosure ptsd
post-traumatic stress disorder because
the people who
penetrate the veil
and begin to see what&#39;s actually going
on they are traumatized
i mean i went through
serious personal trauma in 1992 three
and four when i realized
what&#39;s really happening here who&#39;s
behind it what&#39;s being kept secret these
same people are going through that now
the members of congress
haven&#39;t reached the trauma point yet
they&#39;re still at the point where they
have very limited even the classified
briefings and the problem is
is that
if you give people whether it&#39;s the
american public
or members of the congress or the
national security council staff and
president white house staff
too much information too quickly
they shut down
they they shut down they pull the plug
they said i don&#39;t hear any more about
this
so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s like walking
the razor&#39;s edge slip your cut in half
because
and this is what we&#39;re facing i&#39;m being
very frank with my followers here and
supporters
this is delicate because
you can&#39;t
you i mean i&#39;ve lived with this for my
entire life since i had contact when i
was young and then as head of the
disclosure project and it&#39;s the
repository
of
almost a thousand top secret military
whistleblowers
over the last 30 years who&#39;ve come to me
and given me their information
specific information
but if you&#39;re just now going gee the
ufos are real
and you&#39;re at that point
to ingest this entire paradigm and all
this information
um
it&#39;s a bridge too far
and i recognize that i&#39;m very
compassionate
about that and i think that&#39;s why some
patients
uh
is needed here now i think
dragging your feet
too long into this process
is not good i think what we need to do
or create a series of
briefing modules
level one level two all the way up to
level ten or twenty that takes people
from the beginning in an organized
very hard evidence way
all the way to the advanced knowledge of
the threat from inside
the existence of a transnational
superstate
the technologies that exist
that are thousands of years beyond what
the u.s government of we the people have
access to the normal government of the
united states usg
that that information is catastrophic if
you are
the president or in charge of the senate
intelligence committee or armed services
or even top brass at the pentagon who
first find out about this it is
traumatic
now for conspiracy theory people
gobbling up rubbish on the internet in
the general public it&#39;s all
entertainment it is not entertaining
when you deal with
the bold-faced
gravity
of the situation and you are responsible
and you&#39;re doing this responsibly
because you know it it then becomes
something where
too much tmi too much information pushed
too fast
could blow up the system where everyone
just runs for the hills and shuts down
the investigation so i&#39;m trying we&#39;re
having the first
we i
we&#39;re trying to proceed
as quickly as possible but realizing
we&#39;re dealing with with folks who
really are at the very elementary level
of making the first kinds of questions
and that&#39;s unfortunate i mean this is
that you know anyone who&#39;s looked at any
of
our documentaries and books would know
more than
the senior people in congress but
that&#39;s that&#39;s
the disconnect and remember
if you&#39;re
if you&#39;re a member of of
congress
you&#39;re dealing with a thousand issues
everything from the ukraine to the
budget to inflation
to war to you know uh social issues
their deal with so many things that
the time they have to focus on any and
at this point remember
the gravitas of this problem
and the implications of it
are not known to these members it is not
i will say that with authority with
personal knowledge and for that reason
we have to be a little patient with the
process
yeah it&#39;s a big pill to swallow a lot of
information it&#39;s bigger than just blurry
objects in the sky
along those lines but you know is there
anything else that stood out to you in
regards to yes i mean at 51 minutes you
have uh scott bray oh and i house naval
intelligence say when it when it comes
to material that we have
uh
there there&#39;s nothing there
nothing would suggest non-terrestrial
origin but uh
uh a number of these uaps you said we
can&#39;t explain
again in the service of sort of reducing
speculation and conspiracy theories
we can&#39;t explain
can range from
a visual observation that was distant on
a foggy night we don&#39;t know what it is
to
we&#39;ve found an organic material that we
can identify right those are radically
different world worlds so when you say
we can&#39;t explain give the public a
little bit
better sense of where on that spectrum
of we can&#39;t explain we are are we
holding materials organic or inorganic
that we don&#39;t know about are we
you know picking up emanations that are
something other than light or infrared
that could be deemed to be
communications give us a sense for what
you mean when you say we can&#39;t explain
sure when i say uh we can&#39;t explain i i
mean exactly as you described there that
there is a lot of information like the
video that we showed in which there&#39;s
simply too little data
to to create a reasonable explanation
there are a small handful of cases in
which we have more data
that our analysis simply hasn&#39;t been
able to uh to fully pull together a
picture of what happened
the
and those are the cases where we talk
about where we see some indications of
flight characteristics or signature
management
that are not what we had expected
when it comes to material that we have
we have no material
we have detected no emanations
within the uap task force that that is
uh that would suggest it&#39;s anything
non-terrestrial uh in origin
well that what this says to me if that&#39;s
a factual statement
is that he doesn&#39;t have
even an introductory briefing yet
on what&#39;s sitting at wright patterson or
the nellis range
or out at fort sill
near lawton oklahoma or is in the
mountain outside seoul korea that is an
american installation we&#39;ve built to
hold a huge et crappie down there or the
uh nine
uh et vehicles and the dissected bodies
that are underneath the desert near fort
huachuca army intelligence headquarters
out in arizona near tombstone ironically
named so you know the fact that i have
multiple people on my team who&#39;ve been
in these facilities
and have provided us with actionable
information
and yet these guys who are the
authorities
testifying before congress don&#39;t know of
it
is pretty disturbing i mean it&#39;s like
how can this possibly be the case except
again
they either are not being truthful which
i
i have a hard time believing they would
lie under oath in a public hearing but
possibly
or they&#39;re deliberately keeping
themselves out of the loop or their
staff or not letting them know so that
they don&#39;t
uh
they can they can honestly be the front
men
saying being called up and then
if you really don&#39;t know you&#39;re not
lying right
so this is the whole that&#39;s the concept
of plausible deniability so one of the
two things is going on one of the two
and if they did admit that they had uh
materials retrieved that would open up a
can of worms and obviously they want to
avoid that at all costs necessary as far
as the language we&#39;re getting anything
else uh you&#39;re looking at here
yes i mean look at the uh at times stamp
54
minutes
and i
where moultrie says i&#39;m not aware of any
contractual programs that are focused on
anything related to this
other than uh in the navy task force and
their own well this is ludicrous
i mean you know
uh look at what the head of the lockheed
skunk works lockheed is a contractor
and ben rich
we have his written note
that says
that they are both ours meaning man-made
ufos and extraterrestrial
and he said underlines ufo as unfunded
opportunities ufo he rises in this
letter it&#39;s in my book unacknowledged
it&#39;s in the documentary
and this is in his handwriting it&#39;s
uncontested it&#39;s not a contested
document at all
so now you go
whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute that
was dated i think in the 80s or 90s
and you&#39;re telling me that you have no
knowledge after all this research and
time and millions of dollars
that there are major contractors from
booz allen hamilton to northrop grumman
to lockheed to
a bunch of them
that are contracted
to research this issue and the energy
and propulsion systems there with
that attend how these things move this
is ridiculous so again
you know that statement to me was one of
the most astonishing things i&#39;ve ever
read uh given the fact that
you know if evidence on about that we
have collected catalogued organized and
put out to the public for decades now
yep this is pretty
yeah ben rich wasn&#39;t writing a science
fiction novel it was a personal uh
letter to james c goodall and uh it was
quite revealing what else are you seeing
over there
oh i was just looking at the details of
uh
some of my notes about uh how completely
frankly you know as it gets further
along and they ask more and more
questions how the how the answers become
more and more
evidence of either not knowing anything
or
just idiotic i mean the thing is it sums
it all they didn&#39;t know anything they&#39;re
looking into it and they&#39;re going to be
transparent
as much as they can to avoid revealing
any national security thing but then
again as dr as uh
michael schratt would say a big nothing
burger came from this
um what what are you gonna
well no i think you know it&#39;s not a
nothing burger because
if you have go ahead
if if you have something like the fact
that this happened at all
and and the fact that the people up
there
had no information
they didn&#39;t even have any technical
assistance
to run their slideshow that&#39;s in videos
these volumes yes
what is what does this say about how
seriously this is being taken
i mean anyone who would have a month to
read through the extant
already existing literature that&#39;s
serious stuff i don&#39;t mean channelers or
what have you but hard stuff on this
subject that like in the disclosure
project or timothy good&#39;s book above top
secret
excuse me you know i don&#39;t know how you
could have done any homework on this at
all and or gone into uh the files that
exist at various websites that have
government documents on this
for example
the most viewed documents fbi website is
the one we published after we published
it about the field officer guy hotel
to jagger hoover about the crash in new
mexico and roswell and the debris
now that&#39;s an official document
and that it was somehow down because we
had a new quote radar system
radar is a euphemism for electromagnetic
weapon
in this case
that was switched on and caused these
objects to collide and crash
well
that&#39;s an official
uncontested
original
fbi document that&#39;s the most viewed
document
on the fbi website
we published it now
so if you were going to just do your
primer like beginning research on this
you would know all of this and it you
don&#39;t have to go to
tall tales from the internet and from
ufology
stick with the military whistleblowers
stick to the government documents the
known cases
that&#39;s all been put out there it&#39;s all
there
and so this is where i get very um
worried about the process because i
think the process if it continues like
this any further is going to undermine
what we&#39;re trying to do what what
they&#39;re trying to do what they claim
they&#39;re doing and what the members of
congress have ordered them to do
because you know this is now in in the
bill
these are now mandated by law that they
research this and report back to the
people&#39;s house
the congress the senate and house
and so
that&#39;s either got to be done seriously
or not if it&#39;s going to be done
seriously the people in charge cannot
stick their head in the sand
and just say i don&#39;t know anything about
anything
you know because it&#39;s been in the
civilian domain no it&#39;s in the civilian
domain because we&#39;ve done our research
for 30 years
and you this has been done for you
now
if it&#39;s a government document or a
verified person like admiral wilson
why aren&#39;t those people being brought up
to be in uh subpoenaed
i have the names of hundreds of people
like admiral wilson
that can be subpoenaed
under oath where they would have to tell
the truth and this whole thing would be
case closed
all right
now
that being the case and that&#39;s been
offered
that&#39;s being provided through channels
why not what&#39;s happening
uh why aren&#39;t they doing that so it
makes you wonder if this really is going
to just be a wind addressing and sort of
a um
a dog and pony show or are they going to
pivot
to saying well now we&#39;ve discovered this
this and this
and this is why it&#39;s very important for
those of us in the public we the people
not to take our foot off the gas
for a nanosecond on pushing for
disclosure because if we stop pushing
for that
they&#39;re going to say okay
we&#39;ve placated and sort of uh satisfied
these initial inquiries by these very
busy people in the u.s government
and the media and now we can pivot back
to the same old status quo of cover-up
and so i think this is where
any attempt to hush up
censor or
marginalize
people doing serious research on this is
very dangerous because i don&#39;t think in
a democracy you can ever count
on secret programs in a government
really
becoming clean
that&#39;s only going to happen if the
people
keep the pressure up
no i think
their goal was to almost dumb it down by
presenting the evidence that was very
lackluster they&#39;re showing a balloon in
the sky
nothing extraordinary this is the best
footage that they they have
and they&#39;re trying to dumb down the
whole subject matter but looking at the
whole thing overall there there was a
lot of uh red flags there what are we
looking at there well look at this one
this is a zinger
can i read it yes please yeah
and this is a quote from moultrie
there aren&#39;t separate uap
sensors
there&#39;s not a separate uap processing
computer
false
my military advisor was at norad back
ages ago
and there was console 50
with the deep space command that did
nothing but track
ufos in space
and it was a compartmented specialized
computer
so either
but see he makes a blanket statement
here
that in none of these projects do we
have that kind of sensor system or
computers dedicated to manning this
he no one should make a bold-faced
assertion like that he should say
i don&#39;t know
i haven&#39;t been read into
but to make this statement it is a it is
not a qualified statement it says there
aren&#39;t there are not
separate and i know this to be a
provably false
statement but it was under oath so
i again he
these people they either need to be
very prudent in what they make a
statement like that because the members
of congress will come out of a meeting
like this and go oh well this is under
under oath therefore he said that there
are no
sensors and there are no specialized
computers so we really are building the
system from scratch
when in reality we began developing
those systems in the 40s and 50s
so and they certainly exist today and
very sophisticated ones
so i think this is another example
of a probably false statement
and without qualifiers you know if you
qualify and say to the best of my
knowledge or i don&#39;t know or
um it could exist somewhere but i
haven&#39;t been read into it but that&#39;s not
what he said
he made a blanket statement they don&#39;t
exist well they absolutely do exist
yeah
what a day it was is a week that we&#39;re
all looking forward to and that there
was quite revealing uh statements as far
as these blanket statements and the
evidence that contradicts these
statements uh over and over again it was
it&#39;s quite revealing you know we got a
few minutes left i know one of the
things i wanted to point out is that
we&#39;re towards the very end about an hour
and 20 minutes
mr moultrie makes the comment about
a blue on blue
events
where it could be one of ours that we
mistake
i won&#39;t ask you in this setting
obviously to describe any secret dod
programs that said i do want to make
sure the u.s government isn&#39;t chasing
its own tail
firstly do you have a clear and
repeatable process to check with
compartment programs about whether a uap
sighting is attributable to a u.s
aircraft
secondly do
does the aimsaw
staff have the clearances
and read-ons that they need to
investigate all of these incidents and
and thirdly
when your staff cannot be read on
are your questions to those who are read
on even being answered
so i&#39;ll start and then i&#39;ll pass that to
uh to mr bray so we&#39;re very conscious of
the potential blue on blue issue or u.s
on u.s and so we&#39;ve established
relationships with organizations and
entities that
that are uh potentially uh flying or
developing platforms for their own
interests if you will and our goal is to
continue and we have a repeatable
process i think we&#39;ve had that process
for some time
to deconflict uh activities that we may
have to ensure that we are not
potentially reporting on something that
may be
a developmental platform or a u.s
operational platform that is performing
uh either testing or performing a
mission to me
that was the most important thing that
he said
us on u.s
now i don&#39;t know if he&#39;s
if somebody tipped him off that this was
a big part of the problem
but it is because
these if you look at what came out
through
the uh kind of false flag operation
known as ttsa and people like elizondo
that almost all the cases they were
presenting
were
man-made us above top secret
aircraft
doing incursions
into airspace and facilities
uh to for their psychological warfare
value
uh and their hours so it is blue on blue
to use
mr moultrie&#39;s terminology
but more so than he i mean that one
little statement
i was thinking yeah you don&#39;t know how
right you are
that the vast majority
of
and to me that was the truest statement
although i&#39;m not sure he didn&#39;t unpack
it like i am right now
is that the vast majority of these
encounters
that have been over sensitive
installations are
our illegal covert aerospace program
that he may not know about
but that is they need to be thinking
that way because right now they&#39;re going
it&#39;s from china it&#39;s from here or maybe
it&#39;s from outer space and it&#39;s alien
um
when the vast majority of the things
that have been concocted as a threat
and presented as a threat
are actually
been just made out of whole cloth by
humans
this up to and including the abduction
phenomenon
the mutilations
and let&#39;s not forget the 1500 pages of
disinformation
uh that was released a month or two ago
by the department of defense about the
burns and the headaches and pregnancies
and abductions that have been done that
were put together in a file
by dr kitt green christopher green who&#39;s
an md and a ph.d
who but who&#39;s a member of the
counterintelligence team
putting out false information that i&#39;ve
known him for i know i mean he&#39;s been
around for decades
and so that was released we haven&#39;t
talked about that
from the pentagon based on a foia
request well let me tell you four year
requests almost never result in anything
being released on this subject that was
released for its psychological warfare
value it made it all through the news
because why then it
presents this
as something
as the fear factor
and that&#39;s why 11 months ago or 10
months ago we released the cosmic hoax
which everyone can see that documents
what this long-term agenda has been to
manufacture a threat from outer space
because how else does a global
fascist
militarized group
gain power over an entire planet it&#39;s
not through a war in ukraine it&#39;s
through
a
a planet against the planet
one against another and that is really
the long-term
strategic defense plan of this covert
group and
the way that they can achieve it
is by utilizing
these technologies that they have that
humans have that stimulate or fake
uh alien encounters and incursions
so
this has to be really unpacked for the
members of congress but see they&#39;re not
even at that point of realizing that
there are two distinct things going on
one a secret government within the
government that&#39;s transnational and all
over the world
that has a thousand years more advanced
technologies than the us government they
know about has and extraterrestrial
objects
and the two are deliberately co-mingled
and
put together in a confusing narrative
like that 1500 page release
because they want the public if they&#39;re
going to believe in this at all that
they believe in it through the paradigm
of fear
war
panic
invasion rape all the all the actionable
trigger points that humans have when
they&#39;re afraid of something foreign or
some alien so this is this is
classics psyops psychological warfare
operations
and i i think that
you know we had a little peek into this
concept of blue on blue or us on us and
the left hand not knowing what the right
hand&#39;s doing uh to me at the very end
there that was probably the most
beginning of a hopeful
comment
it did seem like they were uh
at least
looking at the idea that we have
technology and it could be blue and blue
activity and that was kind of refreshing
and uh that language was proper you know
we got about a minute and 30 seconds
left is there anything uh else you want
to add what are you up to next
um
well
i&#39;m up to my eyebrows and alligators
dealing with this here in washington but
what i&#39;d say is
we need people who are listening who are
legitimate researchers who hold
archives of significant information
evidence like i said
government documents whistleblower leads
to whistleblowers
actionable intelligence on facilities
corporations
and very well analyzing legitimate
photos and videos
because what we have to do in this what
we&#39;re back channeling into the
government
is the best evidence that we can get so
they don&#39;t keep showing rubbish like
that corbell video
that&#39;s okay so so you guys
should help us with that there are a lot
of people who who are listening that
have content and what we&#39;re doing right
now just so you have an idea we&#39;re doing
a global
scrub a scrub of the whole plan of
everything that could be a legitimate
source of information
that will then be analyzed and triaged
most important to least important if it
seems spurious
or not legitimate we&#39;ll just take it out
yeah so um you know again if people can
be in touch with us uh at uh
siriusdisclosure.com
s-i-r-i-u-s-disclosure.com
if you have this kind of evidence
archive material
um it will be handed off hand to hand
from me to these folks who are trying to
get to the bottom of it
um now is the time there is a door open
how long that door will be open i don&#39;t
know
but i suggest we move through it
expeditiously quickly
absolutely we just received a video that
we put up and it has multiple angles
over hawaii of a massive triangular
craft and people are shocked and we&#39;re
going to send that over to you and among
other uh evidence from the public that i
think the the people on your end might
be interested in and uh we&#39;ll be keeping
in touch i know again hopefully more
hearings we just uh finished the
documentary that we&#39;re on location
within we&#39;re in the process of the edit
while we&#39;re there in arizona and people
are going to be blown away there&#39;s the
phenomenon was captured
and including right now above top secret
which is uh breaking records right now
on amazon prime and it&#39;s on the front
page and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s being picked up
and i i even think the congress people
watched that that we could hear their
questions to the eyewitnesses i think
they were a little briefed or deep or
brief buyer documentary so that&#39;s a good
thing uh dr greg resafe we&#39;ll talk to
you soon appreciate it thank you keep
with the good work all right thanks
everyone okay bye-bye we&#39;ll see ya
bye-bye see ya
