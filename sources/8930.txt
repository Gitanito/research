  		              		Experience Description   

    I remember being in a hospital room, just above the heads of the doctor and nurse. I moved up to the ceiling. I could see my mother.I watched as the doctor  and the nurse were unwrapping the umbilical cord from around my neck. I noticed there was a lot of movement as the doctor was urgently saying or yelling something as two nurses were wheeling in a cart. I looked at my body that  was bluish-purple. The doctor was hiding me from my mother. As I looked down from the ceiling, I looked at the light in the room where the doctor, nurse and the tables were. And then I was gone. 

   The next thing I remember was walking hand-in-hand with a man wearing a white garment. He had  a glow to him.  I had no fear of anything.  It was as though I was wrapped in warm love. I saw other people  dressed in a white garment. Some of the people would stop and wave as if to say, 'Hi.' I don't remember any words being spoken. I  knew things. The sky was not blue as we know it. Everywhere there was a warm light. The dwellings were white, and looked  like  white stucco house with  rounded corners, no sharp edges. It was as though everything flowed together as if it belonged there. 

The man and I walked hand-in-hand for a little while and turned to the left to continue on our journey.  I saw the most incredible crystal tree. All of it was crystal including the tree trunk, branches, and what looked like leaves that were flat with beveled edges. There was no wind as we know wind here, but there was  movement. It moved the crystal leaves,  just enough to touch. When the movement touched the leaves, it sounded so beautiful. The leaves changed color  as if the light separated into unique colors like  a prism and I could hear sound all at the same time. The sound was so pure like  the sound of a high-pitched triangle that was  very pleasant to the ear. It makes me think of wind chimes. The sound felt  as though it went through me.  It was as if I could hear it inside me. We watched for a little while and then continued on our journey as if I were supposed to be somewhere. 
  
  
  Much later, I found out that I was covered up and wheeled into a special room for babies. I did not see my mother for a day. When they they brought me into nurse, I had  lost a pound and a half. That is as much as I can remember thus far.

  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I started having flash backs, and dreams. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify. My mother has passed, and time has passed. I don't know, there might still be some records. I did ask my mother about certain things, she would ask how I knew this. I got enough information out to find it was traumatic, and they thought they lost me.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it

  At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         I don't know. I was stillborn. All of it. I had no idea of time.

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

  What was your religion prior to your experience?      No comment.   I had no idea of anything. I was stillborn.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Uncertain     I don't have any way of knowing.  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Protestant   I have moved from Methodist, to Presbyterian, to non-denominational, looking for more answers

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I did not hear any voices as we know them but I just knew what was wanted of me. I did walk hand-in-hand with a man. I knew he was a man by his presence. I could feel that  he had authority. 

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

  Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   As I remember, I never saw a face as one would actually see a face. It was as though I could feel his authority and knew  he was in charge.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     I was in what I or we call heaven. I was somewhere filled an  all engulfing love. Was it mystical? I don't know, good question. But it sure felt real.  

  During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     I felt it, and I just knew it. Nothing had to be said because I just knew it.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists.          I was stillborn. Then I was in another place that was filled with love.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         No       

  During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I guess you could say I experienced pure love; a no holds barred, wrap you up in it, kind of Love.  

  What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown.     I have been teased, told I just want attention, that I am  making up stories.  I was laughed at and called stupid. All my life I have endured this. I can't tell how or why I know these things, I just remember them.  With the memories, comes pictures in my mind, pictures of a time and place with feelings.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Uncertain I don't have any way of knowing.  

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It is hard to find the words that describe feelings and emotions. It would be as if I asked you to tell me what a rainbow felt like.  

  How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I remember my life in pictures, photos of time and events, good and bad. I can go back a little further than 10 months. And yes, these memories have been verified by family photos.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Yes     I have synesthesia. Animals will come up to me. I can feel emotional pain of others and  I can see inside people's hearts, (ugly and beautiful).  

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          My synesthesia is beautiful, and the animals can be fun. I mean when a two-ton rhinoceros comes up within arms reach from a zoo and looks at me with no fear, it can be fun.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    with family, and a few friends. That's when I'm called names and told that I am making up stories, and so on...  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     I had to grow up. I thought every one experienced it; I didn't know. But the flashbacks, and dreams kept coming. The pictures were there. The feelings of pure Love, was still there.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     How can you tell someone what a rainbow feels like to you? Or tell me how you love the way you do. You can convey reasons, thoughts, and what it does. To describe a feeling or how you love the way you do that is intangible. You know, deep inside, you just know.  

  At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       Yes   Dreams and flashbacks.
