  		              		Experience Description   

    My experience happened 54 years ago. I have always wanted to share my experience but never knew how. 

  One early morning, something woke me up.   I went to the bathroom and noticed I was bleeding and strangely enough, I could barely see. I was scared and woke my husband up and he called my physician who then said for me to get to the hospital immediately.
  
  Once entering the hospital, I remember everyone around me very frantic. That night, I remember vividly  drifting off and losing consciousness. I remember being in a tunnel and seeing an  unbelievably bright, white light. It was everywhere. Everything in the light was so beautiful and colorful. It's very hard to describe.  I'll never forget the feeling of peace and calmness. It was  like the most unreal feeling of love and tranquility.  It was like nothing I have ever felt before or since my experience.
  
  I don't remember how it was spoken or directed to me that I had to go back and  could not stay. I remember repeatedly begging to stay in that peaceful, state of tranquility.  I didn't want to leave. Anyone that knows me, knows that I love my life and my family.  I wouldn't have wanted to leave either one. The  only way to explain this discrepancy is that I was in a place of the most awesome beauty, the feelings were so strong; I was in the middle of all that is perfect,  wonderful, peaceful, and full of love. I was willing to give up all my worldly life and stay there. It is very hard to believe, but I did experience it ALL.
  
  I was later told that the doctor came out to speak to my husband and mother.  They were both told that I was very sick with toxemia poisoning and severe eclampsia. I experienced  hemorrhaging and edema that had settled behind my eyes and caused temporary blindness. The doctors were trying to save both, me and my unborn child, as I was 6 weeks early from delivery. Through the grace of God, my son is now 54 years old and is a wonderful blessing. Recently, I  heard others who experienced the same things that I had, so I decided to share my experience.
  
  It is comforting to know that others felt it was as real as I did. I don't remember whether I had always thanked God everyday for my life, although and always believed in God's goodness and mercy. Today and every day, I do thank God for my life and my blessings. I only hope that he is not disappointed that he sent me back.

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        No

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    It is hard to remember for certain the time frame when I shared my experience with someone because for a while, I kept it to myself thinking I had a dream.

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real.
