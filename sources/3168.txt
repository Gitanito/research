This · lesson will explain mq.ny o.f the
very stran _
ge ari~ .9u~~o1.1:s beliefs .· that
mankind l!as he~d :tbpougho~;t ~4e ages. In
all races or reli:gions, .w~ Jnig_q.t· .say -.,
·
universal, - there have 1:>een.and are leg-
ends concerning the source of man's
origin in the far distant days of the
begin,ning of li _
fe.
. Without exception, every race in
the ·wor],d·:, .~very relig:i,on, has some.where
qr othe-r .t ;aught that the source of man 1
.s
.first beg:i,ril'ling was in the North. I, -of
. oours1~r, am familiar with the modern the-
ory of-the migra ,tion of races from cen-
t~al Asia. That however, is unde -

Vllisdorn, to hav~ been a later migration

Also,.. the · anci .ent .wisdom teaches
· that man is far mor·e ancient upon this
earth than is ordinarily believed in our
modern tiiiies, .or _

-3'.'.:'
to -you abo ut are not theories and are
not guesswork. They are taken from the
most ancient of E
.::.1 the records which
exist in the worl~ today because there
are records that go back t o the time of
man's very beginnin g and so, to b egi n my
lesson a:~the ~ roper place, I am go ing _
to start with the theory -·
that ·is advanced
in the Book of · Genesis - that : is, the
theory of _ .Eden _as being the primal or ·
first 'home of ·mankind. -·
When we r ea d the .Book of Genesis we
find that Eden was East. That is, ac- ·
cordin g to the translation as we find it
in the Bible w
hich . _
says, 'Eastward in
Eden 1 • That is - obviously an incorrect
translation because _ the ,ori ginal word
was Negg-edeni. Th at is the · word transla-
ted 'as east and no.where else in the o-
ld
Hebraic T0
e stameht is ,th e, wor d tr ari s·iat-
ed as be ginnin g.· Therefore, sayirig th a t
'Ed .en 'was East' -is · incorrect; that Eden
was a place of' ·beginnings. I wan t you
to note · that: 'Eden was a place of be-
ginnin gs, because - I wan·t t o show you ho w
in all reli gions and beliers the concept
of man as originatin g in the North Polar

-Let us consider ·' that we- are at 'the
d"ir :ect ·Nor th Pole ·. W
e would find -certain
conditions there prevalent ' that 'we would
find nowher e else . i.n 1
the worlde First,
wi ~ould find thit there would be a di-
vision of the year into day an d ' ·ni gh t.
Th_
a t is, that approximately four-fifths
of the year · would be · light in some de-
-4-
gree, about one-tifth would .be total

k · of a day as being
.
six · months and also, .· ni ght being six
months · long in · the .. nor•th _'." the .f ul;L day
is stx mpnths long b~t there is a period
of dawn and a period of twilight which
leaves appI'0xim1?-te .ly _only one-fifth . dark-
ness, I£ we were at . the .Poles at this
moment an.d looked up . ':rn would see stars
· move in . a circular motion ar .ound us and
nowhere else .would ;
that ' co.ndi tion exist.
. . ~ . -
.. . '· L
I ~ant to say, the true ~North Pole
has never been discovered, Later on in
my :talk, . I :will show. you why it has not
been discovered; though " all current
phenomena point to its . discovery. ·
Standing at .the North Pole . · there
would be ·an unmoving centE3r point direct _
-
;ty overhead, . This would be the t-op of
the world _. or ..the . very center of the
e~rthly. universe. The anci~nts, consid-
ered tha~ as the .-true heaven, the center
6:t the· untve~se • . If one were at that
place and ~hen would move away from it
just a.little bit . they would seem · to·get
away : fro~ the · center ;of the _ ~niverse.
They would find ._
the · stars did not move in
that apparent circular movemerrt.
Let us ' say that in the very beginn~
ing .of , -~ime, a_
s the an,oient . records
te1;1.ch, 'that there are seven great c t;,nti-
nents or land ma~se _
s; ancient tradition
says t~e North Pol~r Contin~nt was the
first upon which life appeared ...and the
first upon 11vhic};l
man appeared, .not only
animal man but the first god-like man.
-5-
Conditions there were entirely different
from anywhere else upon the surface of
the earth. · L-:+.er or~, w
hen that race
moved away from that primal or original
home1 in other parts of the wo~ld it
would be remembered as the central land.
You will remember, that in the Eden
story in Genesis there were four rivers
flowing out of Eden. If one were at the
Nor th Polar Regions th~ rivers would
fl :oiNin different directions, so the
legend of the four rivers flowin g forth
fro 'l:i.l
Ede:n, taken from the material stand-
·point would pre-dispose us that it must
come from some place like the North Pole.
At the time of w
hich I am speakin g ,
and evid 8nce is borne out by geology and
zoology, the North was a tropical fertile
country. ·· In fact, it ·ha s been tau ght
that mi llions ot ·years agoj the poles
were hotter ·than ·the Equat orial regions
at the present time. VJh
en the races of
mankind ·rriigrated away · from t here, they
would remember it as a great central
point and -the ancient wisdom tells us
that at the very poirit · occupying the
center of that Polar Continerit, that the
great city of the god-race was built and
in later legends that city became the
home or mountain of the gods,
The Hindoos called .it the Holy ··Mount
Meru. They also spoke of Ku-Meru at the
south Pole. -· The ancients said, that the
god-like race li ved at that pole; that
later man was not like the original .r r,c0;
in that age of time the race of mankind
-'i-
were giants, they lived for ~n extremely
long len gth of time, so long that for all
p1·actical purpose it was immortality.
In th at original Polar Land, as I
· said, -four-fifths of the tiEle there would
be the light of the sun • .It is for that
reason t_
hat the ancients looked upon the
l'T
orth, riot ~he East as the home of the
sun-God. Those great nations of the east
that worshipped the sun as a God always
turned towards the North in their worship
of the sun. They considered that the
sun kingdom was in the north, not in the
east where under ordinary circumstances
they would haie laoked at the east a~
being the home of . the sun gods.
The Scandinavian mythoiogy and -also
th6s~ of the Hindoos; Egyptians, Chal-
deans and others, tau ght that the Aurora
Borealis was the light reflected from
the home of the Gods and they · said that
as lon g as that light continued to shine
in the North that ·the home of ~he gods
:eemained; . that that was the li ght of the
gods reflected from the Holy M6unt Meru,
Other nati ons us.ed oth er. --·
names which I
will mention later.
The ancient records , also say this;
that that Aurora Borealis; - I suppose
you all know what .it is - to use a more
common term, the Northern lights. I be-
lieve as far south as Denver you can see
them at certain times . of the year. When
they first begin to break they are the
color of a pearl. Then, that becomes
shot thr-ough with all the colors of the
-7-

and fi _
nally, a gr eat mass of
·color hangs in tho sky like a blanket ·. ..
· The ancienti say; that the north
Polar region was, and still is, the home
of the . God-Race, because all of them
liav~ not di::iappeared from the earth •. Al-
so~ · at the North Pol~ there is a concen-
tration .of the magnetic currents of the
ear~h and that t~e magnetic _currehts 9f
the earth );)lending · with ··the stat .ic el~c .-

·'tlfei r' :1egE;Jnds the fact that the
-:9-
very apex of the world we now call the
Poles was the home cf the gods but around
t h em were gathered . the less~r men but
who had mind and intelligence, who had
soul and they had driven away from them
the great soulless creation. They had
driven them out from the home in wh:tch
men who were entirely different fro~ the
God-men existed.
Then, farther out, , at what we now
call the South Pole was the place of the
earth that they call the home of the de~
mons. Do not laugh at that because be-
fore I am through . I am ·goin g to show you
where there is certain ·· symbolism in the
Christian Bible which really taught ex-
actly the . same tn,ing. ·
Among the Hindoos a very strange
and· curious symbol Was used .;_it W/3.S this:
it was of a globe or sphere divided into
four parts. On t ·op of it was a triangle
representing a mountain. Below it was
another triangle; andther mountain; the
lower one representing the South Pole
and the upper one, the North Pole. The
· four . divisions represented or symbolized
the four ancient parts of the world. To
the student of symbolism there is a vast
wisdom embodied in that~ It dates back
into the very ·beginning of time when the
world was divided into fqur parts. In
· that symbol we find the origin of the
worlds, because the worlds is nothing
more or less tl-J.an a di vision of the world
of the beginning into four separate parts.
The mountain, ' which by the Hindoos was
called Su Meru, · and the lower mountain
-10-·
called Ku-Meru; were the two mountains,
the Holy Mountain and the infernal moun-
tain. They always considered the South
Pole as the lower or infernal mountain
an d the North Pole as the Holy Mount
Meru.
·
.You might also say, .in those tri-
ang les, that triangle with the point up-
ward symbolizes God; the triangle with
the point downward symbolizes the nega-
tive or lower plane existence and some-
times, it is shown in the six-pointed
star joined · together so that the protec-
tive.mountain of heaven will neutralize
or balance the mountain of evil, · and
therefore becomes a balanced symbol. The
Egyp tians had exactly the same symbol as
that one and they taught that at the North
Pole that Holy Mountain reached from the
earth into heaven.
To gi ve you a quotation from the
Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Papyrus
of Ani. "Oh, the very · tall hill of Hades
tbe heaven rests upon it. There is a
snake or dragon Aupon it. Sati is his
name". They believed that at the North
and South Poles .were mountains, that the
heaven surrounded them, that the Holy
Mount Meru reacheQ into heaven, the gods
dwelt on the mountain and the topmost
peak rested in heaven and .on it rested
the great serpent of wisdom and beyond
it was a great Hydra which they called
Sati. Can't you see from the term Sati
whe re the ancients got their Satan. Sati
easily becomes Satan. I am going to show
you more about that in just a minute.

The Chinese called it the Pearl
Mountain or Mountain of the Great Pearl
with a living fo'.lntain flowing forth from
it that forms f·our rivers and around it
revol~es the visible heavens.
The Taoists of Japan when they id-
dress the gods turn with their face to-
war.ds the North, the remnant of the an-
cient- knowledge that the north was the
place of beginnings~·
I might mention, for the benefit of
some of you who do not know what the word
Meru means in Sanskrit, Meru means 'a.xis
or pivot, the Holy"M'ountain axis or piv-
ot.' Strange is it not, hut if we under-
stand that we were referring to the Holy
Mountain or great raise of ground whi_oh
existed and still exists, upon which the
City of the gods was built.
I am using the term, gods to con-
cern the ancient or. beginning race that
was so much greater than later man; that
·to la..ter mari · they could only be . called
.gods. In other words, what we WO'l.;lld
call
~he direct .. manifestation of the divine
.upon earth.
:The _Japanes.e say this: that a God
and Goddess· were .standing on the bridge
of heaven and stuck a spear into the
earth and tu,rned it round and round and
it becane the axis cf' the earth; that is,
the North Pole and frcimit was formed the
home of the beginning of man.
In the Talmud of the Hebrews there
-14-
is this curious quotation: "There is a:n
upper and lower para.dise - between th~
a pillar joining them together, c_alled
11St_rength of ti.1.eHill of Zion". They
considered that the Holy Mountain of the·
North was the Paradise of the North and
from there the ascent into the heaven
world was just one step,
I might go so far as to say this:
that the story of the Tower of Babel in
the Christian Bible is nothing more or
less than the story of the Mountain,
which reached into the Home of the Gods.
Once it rose, high upon it was built the
City of the God-race. Around it, lower
down were built the cities of ancient
man. The man races looked with.longing
upon the Home of the Gods on the Holy
Mo.untain and they tried to force their
way up the mountain and the super human
divine power of the God man drove them
out and they scattered into different
parts of the world and the story of the
confusion ·of tongues was nothing more or
less than a legend arising· from the fact
tha.t when men were scatter-ed and formed
tribes and nations and later, when they
got together they could no longer under-
stand each other so the story of the
Tower of Babel arose, when it was merely
the Reincarnation memory of Ezra, in
which he remembered the driving forth of
man from the home of the Gods.
In the Vishnu Purana there is a very
curious symbol shown. Only fragments of
it have been translated into the English
language, and in that they showed the
-15-
wor-ld"divided'into nine divi~ions··. They

·in-the most ancie.nt times,- in the
earlies·t: ·of ·the-· Papyrii' we·have been·ahle
to-_·decipher., the world was divided into
two· parts; . ·the home of the living and
the home of the dead. · It was· not until
later Papyrii that they showed the Halls
of .Amenti as being the.µrtderworld or the
Realm· of the Dead, .while, the Home .of the
Gods was· at the North~ · ·
In the old Greek teachings the place
of Atlas who upheld the world on his
~~oulde:tts was shown as being in :th~ ·Ncrth.
In mentioning that too., '_it -nlight be' of
inter.est to you·to know·thatApollodorus

One of the more ancient of our Greek
writers, 'Anaxagoras., one of the ·other
ancient Gr-eek writers said thj.s: "In· ·the
beginning the .stars 'revolved in a Thali-' ·
form manner .'or revolve :in ·a ..horizontal
1ilanner. . From the. ·-memo'tiy' of :nian in _,·the

.,; . -In -the Zend·.-Avesta ·.of Zorc'.faster, we
find thi's ·quot·ation: "There the stars.,
the moon and the sun are only seen to
rfs·e arid~se·t once a-yeai"' and a. year· seems
only :.a day"..·He is speaking of. the Holy
Gi·ty··.,of the'Gods- upon ·the Holy Mountain.
I-s there- . any .-othE3r place in the world
Where the ·sun·seems to ~ise and set only
once a year? ·
In the law -of Manu·one of. the great
-17-
Hindoo works we find, this: .That Yama,
the first man.lived at the North.Pole;
a clear, a definite statement.
In the Surya Siddhaanta, another
great Hindoo work we find this: The Gods
behold the sun, after it has risen for
half a year. Again, we find the Place
of the Gods as the North Pole.
rnthe book, "The Institutes of
Vishnu", one of the most ancient.of all
Sanskrit manuscripts: "The Northern prog-
ress of the sun is a day with the G.ods.
The Southern progress is a nifrht~ A year
is wit~ them a day and night.' We might
even find one of the misquotations :in the
Bible: ifA yea."!;'is to the Lord as a day."
In another place.it'is "A thousandyears."
· In the Book of Job, . we find that
where he speaks of the North, South, the
East and West, he ·said, "the left is the
North", and is it not curious to note
that the Homeof the Gods is at the North
or left hand and it thus throws th·e home
····of negation or evil at the South or right
·hand, and does not the Bible tell us,
"I go even to the left hand where he doth
work": another quotation of Isiah.
Again, in the Bible, we find this
quotation: "The Lord is thy shade on ·the
...
right hand". Vl/hyis. the Lord thy shade
on the right han~? Because according to
ancient tradition; the place of evil was
the South or at the rig;ht hand.
Again, in the Psalms, we find this:
-18-
"The Lord let stard at his right hand".
Always the Lord stands at the right hand
as a protection against the mindless ones
from the South.
In ancient times, before the Temple
was built ..the priest stood at the North.
When he stood at the Holy of Holies in
the Temple he faced the North; when he
clasped the horns of the al tar of the
Temple of God.
In Ezkiels vision wefind this: "The
Ideal Temple of the future had a chamber
for the ·priests_ of the · al ta:r -- whose
prospect was toward the North".
· In Scandinavia in the old religions
they .said that in the Northern Heaven.,
the Tree., Yggdrasil stood at the very
center of the North and that is the Tree
of Life upon which the world hung. The
Eddas say., it was built in the center of
the· world and that very center Pole was
··the watch-tower of Odin.
In Finland among the ancient Finns,
the Home of the Gods~ the place they al-
ways faced, was called Tahtela which in
Finnish meant the Polar Star.
It is a very curious fact that in
.contradiction to many. of our modern myth-
ologies who say that pillars and altars
wei"'e phall'ic symbols, they say, the pil-
laJ;> represented in ancient times the·
axis which reached from earth:Jnto heaven
Wh$re the Home of the Gods rested. At
the North was the tree which stood in

AN OCCULT VIEWPOINT
BYM. DOREAL
There have been a very considerable
number of books written ;by people who
have observed flying objects of different
kinds and types in the sky over a period
of many years. In the last few years
when there has been a considerable in-
crease in such objects, there has also
been a greater number observed. One rea-
son for that is that today we have larger
populations, people at more obscure points,
better systems of communication and so
forthu Yet, such phenomena is not a new
thing. For centuries, strange objects
have been observed in the skies and be-
yond the skies.
Perhaps my explanations will be ob-
scure and not understandable by those
who are not members of the Brotherhood.
Yet, I believe that if you bear with me
during the course of my explanations,
that the picture will become clear to
you.
The book is divided into three chap-
ters, one for each major classification
of flying objects.
