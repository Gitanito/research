  		              		Experience Description   

    The experience happened when I had surgery for severe uterus adenomyosis on July 24, 2018. The doctor gave me a general anesthetic. I  soon lost consciousness.

  In the next breath, I had the sense that I was  floating in the universe. It was like a long journey, while I flying in the universe. I didn’t feel my body. I was only my consciousness or my spirit. I really liked this happy journey. The place was completely dark. I attained a  natural buoyancy, like I was  scuba diving. I was floating in  the universe without  my body.  It was like  I was floating in my mother’s womb. 

  I was free.  All the while, I was surrounded by a feeling of tremendous love. I felt connection with everyone's  spirit and all energy. I wasn't afraid and I felt so happy.  Then, I understood that we are all connected to each other and I reveled in this knowledge. I felt comfortable and also united with the world. I thought that I wanted to stay here forever.

    In another moment, I was flying and then looked down. I saw place with four rooms and four walls. I can't remember what three rooms looked like,  but I remember last room.  I saw a place that looked like Malta island. I saw a shining, blue sea and low cliffs made from white rocks.  It  was silent here. I watched the landscape for a long time. My body was still floating in the air and  I subtlely moved with my breathing.    

  I heard a very small voice call my name. Suddenly, my earthly body pulled from my legs. The view changed from the Malta island to a black universe. The black universe was a little bit smaller than I have seen from the black universe before.   I slipped down in to a black tunnel or a tube. I felt comfortable.  

  Then, I woke up in the operating room. An anesthesiologist was softly calling my name.  She smiled and said, 'You finished surgery.' 

  I felt like I had been reborn.  I had  surgery for four and a half hours.  I totally forgot the memory at that time except the four rooms and four walls.   Yet, I didn’t understand the meaning of the four rooms. I came back my private room at the hospital.I concentrated on recovering from my surgery.  The next night, I gradually recovered from pain of surgery.  

  All of sudden, a gust of wind blew into my room,  making the curtain flow. It was like somebody ran through my room.    But my the  door and  window were closed.   Although  I am an atheist, I said 'Oh my god!' I lay astounded in my bed.  In the next instant, I came up with the wind. I thought it was me.  Or maybe, it was my higher-self, guardian angel or something.  I thought my higher-self was worried about me. 

  Three days later, I came back my house.  I have reflected on the meaning of the four rooms and  gust of wind.  I  asked my husband, who is an anesthesiologist, 'Do you believe in previous life and reincarnation?'  He answered me, 'Yes,' even thought he has ever never mentioned about the topic to me. He doesn't like to talk about the spiritual world.  He always told me, 'I don’t believe in a previous life, reincarnation, the other side, and so on. After people die, there is nothingness. It means 'Zero'.' 

  However, he said 'Yes' at that time. I was so surprised by his answer.   Now, I  understood about the meaning of the four rooms and walls.   I saw my previous life. I am in my fifth life-time on earth.  I have been very grateful to my husband, family, friends and for everything I have experienced.  Looking back, I was upset because I hadn't could to have a baby. I had worried about it for 15 years.  I tried IVF many times and I went to a Japanese city office and tried get an adopted baby. But unfortunately, I couldn’t get adoption babies.  I thought that I didn’t deserve to live as a human.  But I saw the other side and it changed my mind.   Having children is not the only living human mission.  People will be reborn again and again to have various experiences.   

  I will be reborn again too. So, now I want to change this world and build better world. I don't want to see a land like what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where they were destroyed by the atom-bomb in WWII.   I want to create better world for children, you, and myself.  I was saved by this experience. I feel a great sense of relief in my life now.  In addition, I want to help people who couldn't have a baby too.

Secondly, I talked to other people about my experience. A couple of days later, I got good news, beautiful happenings and great offers unexpectedly.  I think this is a sign from the universe.  I should tell people about the universe or oneness. I think it may be my AIM and job so I will help people and I want to build better world.

I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I can't forget the experience and have vivid memories. The world is always by my side. It is my safety world. I can't compare my experience and other life events because these are totally different. The experience is from a different dimension. The experience isn't through my body but through my consciousness and feeling. I felt all energy. The energy was united but independent each other. I couldn't see people but I felt peoples' soul and energy. I can't forget the blue and quiet sea.

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes. I had the ability to listen and meeting ghosts and other spiritual things but I haven't had the ability now. I connect to the universe. When I talked about the experience, I make many people happy. A couple of days later, I got good news, with beautiful happenenings and great offers unexpectedly. I think this is a sign from the universe. I should tell people about the universe or oneness. I think it may be my AIM and job so I will help people and I want to build better world    

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    I talked about my experience two or three days later to my husband after I was discharge from the hospital. I talked about the experience to my friends and a film director, 2 months later. I made them happy. They like my experience.  A film director was inspired my experience and he made a short film. I performed as a lead actress for his film. Some of my friends told me their  troubles. Some people want to get same experience. Some people want to a spiritual power.  

  Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       Yes   Actually, I was not interested in NDE before. I haeard about NDE, but I thought it is Japanese fairytail or special people's experience or  a psychic  hallucination . 

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably real.     After the surgery, the next night, I gradually recovered from pain of surgery.  All of sudden, a gust of wind blew in my room. The wind was making the curtain big float. It was like somebody ran through my room.    But my  door and  window were closed.   Although  I am an atheistic,  I said 'Oh my god!' as I lay astounded in the bed.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably real.     My soul gave me the experience. May be my soul helped me or encouraged me. I couldn't have a baby. I lost the meaning in my life.
