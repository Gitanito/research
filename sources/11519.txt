            		Experience Description:   

There was no wall in the intensive care unit.  All I saw was blue people and trees and I wanted to get over to the other side, to the ladies in bright white who were laughing and throwing snow, and one of the ladies was my grandma Bessie. The blue trees and people would not let me through. I was always floating above the bed. No matter how hard I tried to go across the trees I couldn't.
