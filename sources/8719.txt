  Probable NDE at age 6 due to drowning.   

    4792.    Nicole D NDE     6/21/2020.      NDE 9019.            Then instead of everything disintegrating with time, everything just started to regenerate, get new life, and get more beautiful - it just took my breathe away. I remember laughing at myself for taking everything so seriously. I realized that I chose to come here to earth, but instead of making it a good place to come and learn, I made it into a Hell. I then felt that a shift was happening. It felt like I had somewhat of a new perspective, and everything was one. 
  NDE due to episode of unconsciousness.   

    4791.    Michael NDE     6/13/2020.      NDE 9017.            I immediately felt a warm feeling with no pain whatsoever. The way to describe it is when coming out of a cold ocean and walking into the sun on the beach. My body was so warm. I felt immediate comfort. I had the faith of a child seeing his Dad as if I had never left him at all. I saw him and he spoke to me, telling me that I wasn't supposed to be home with him yet.  
  NDE due to complication of pulmonary procedure.   

    4790.    Falcon A Probable NDE     6/4/2020.      Probable NDE 9016.       From Mexico.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Camille.     I opened my eyes and saw myself naked, with mud up to my knees. I was in front of a tunnel, but there was no light. It was very dark, which scared me. The mud swirled around my knees and then fell to ground level. I saw myself as the one who was ahead or naked. There were snakes in the mud, like huge anacondas, that moved in the mud.  
  Frightening experience during surgery while under general anesthesia.  NDE vs anesthetic awareness (a rare condition of awareness at time they should be under general anesthesia).   

    4789.    Peter H NDE     5/31/2020.      NDE 9014.       From Australia.     I was up in a corner of the ceiling in the treatment room. I was watching my mum, the nurse, and a doctor urgently moving around my body that was slumped in a chair. I could see everything from different viewpoints within the room, but mostly from above. I watched and felt the urgency within the medical staff and the loving compassion and concern of my mother. 
  NDE due to allergic reaction at age 9.  Shared 53 years later.   

    4788.    Maria V Probable NDE     5/31/2020.      Probable NDE 9012.       From Spain.  Original in Spanish, translated to English by Camille.     I remember seeing from the ground level. There was a black image, like a silhouette, of a lady who was walking on the road from right to left. She was calmly, looking down and pulling a shopping cart about 3-4 meters from me. There was nothing else in the experience. I didn't see cars or other people. I only saw the image of the lady who was calmly moving. She did not react to the accident like she was in her own world. I only observed the scene. 
  Probable NDE due to car accident at age 4.  Shared 41 years later.  Now she is a physician.   

    4787.    Darlene P NDE     5/31/2020.      NDE 16116.            I knew then that I was looking at Jesus. I could see the hem of His garment and His sandals. I remembered the lady in the Bible that had been sick for a very long time and she knew that if she could just touch Jesus that she would be healed. Fighting through a crowd she reached out and touched Him. He felt it and turned and told her she was healed. I looked at the hem of His garment and knew that I to was going to be healed. I reached out with my right arm and touched it. Immediately, I felt a warmth flow throughout my body.    
  NDE due to complications for a ruptured appendix.  Shared 48 years later.   

    4786.    Michael K SDE     5/27/2020.      SDE 9011.            My brother was ahead of me, moving up the tunnel, and I was following him. He serenely turned around after we had moved up the tunnel a little bit and looked at me compassionately. Mind to mind, he told me something like, 'Its not your time. You have to go back.' He felt very kind to me as he communicated. After he communicated that, all of the sudden I was standing in my body near where he was on the ground.  
  Probable shared death experience at age 6.  He was with his brother, age 4, who died in a tire swing accident.  Also describes a NDE-like experience.   

    4785.    Fredrik A Probable NDE     5/27/2020.      Probable NDE 9010.       From Sweden.     I knew that I was dead. I felt no pain and I felt enormous freedom as I left my body. There was an enormous emptiness and silence that I had never heard before. I felt extremely strong feelings that I have never felt before. I did not want to go back to my body because in my body there was pain. I heard a voice that said, 'It is not your time now.' It was like I have heard that voice before.  
  Probable NDE due to apparent episode of unconsciousness associated with severe headache.   

    4784.    Lola M NDE     5/27/2020.      NDE 9009.       From France. Original in French translated to English by Marguy.     Then I saw my grandmother who was deceased in real life. She was radiating light and happy. There was a halo of light surrounding her that prevented me seeing what was behind her. My grandmother was neither old nor young, it was odd so I wouldn't know how to describe it. I talked to her. She told me to go back because we couldn't stay any longer. She told me that it wasn't my time and that I still had things to do.
  NDE due to loss of consciousness at time of illness.   

    4783.    Patti LL NDE     5/26/2020.      NDE 16115.       From Canada     Suddenly, I saw a type of Kaleidoscope and I was in the middle of it. It was like I was watching several large TV or film screens at a time. I viewed different times in my life. It was a Kaleidoscope of my hitch hiking experiences. I saw different experiences going round and round. I saw my mom pulling at me not to go hitchhiking. I saw a girlfriend telling me how concerned she was for me about my hitchhiking. I saw a TV news program talking about a girl that had been hitchhiking and had been murdered. I also saw other situations of myself hitchhiking. 
  NDE due to criminal attack and strangulation.   

      4782.    Rebecca S NDE     5/14/2020.      NDE 9008.       From the United Kingdom.     Gradually, I floated down to solid ground but it didn't look solid. Then out of nowhere, this person stepped out from behind a veil of sorts. I couldn't really see the face but they were tall and I would say it was a man wearing a robe. Looking back, I didn't know this person. But at the time, I looked at the person and it was like I had known them my whole life. I rushed over and hugged the legs and was hugged back.    
  NDE at age seven due to ruptured appendix.   

    4781.    Ken D NDE     5/14/2020.      NDE 9006.       From Denmark     Strangely, I saw my whole life in only a few minutes. Several times along the way, the movie stopped. Each time it was about situations where I had done something thatmade me feel guilty because I knew that what I had done was wrong. I had lied many times and also stole a few times. I was told what this meant to other people and why it had been wrong. In the end, the 'light angel' explained to me that there was a certain meaning to my life and that there were certain things I had to go through to follow the plan that was with me in my life.
  NDE at age seven due to drowning.  Shared 59 years after NDE occurred.   

    4780.    Drew B NDE     5/11/2020.      NDE 9004.            I remember feeling very peaceful as I walk through the flaps of a massive, bright-white tent. Inside the tent, it was full of light and Happiness. There was every kind of animal walking around in harmony with humans. All of the humans were younger. Nobody looked older than 30 years old. Everybody was jovial and laughing. It was a place that I had never been before and I didn't want to leave.  
  NDE after being hit by a car while on a moped.   

    4779.    Melanie J Possible NDE     5/9/2020.      Possible NDE 9003.       From the United Kingdom.     The ‘essence’ of me was reduced to a simple thread of purple frost about 15cm long. The string stayed together without needing to be connected by string or anything, it was simply energy that held them together. The color of the strings varied in tone from pale to deep purple. The essence of me came from the center of my ribcage.   
  Possible NDE associated with side effects of chemotherapy for cancer.   

    4778.    Charlie C NDE     5/9/2020.      NDE 9002.            I heard the voice of my dead grandmother saying, 'Go home Charlie.' This voice was the only thing I remember and it happened right before I woke up.

    4777.    Joe F FDE     5/2/2020.      FDE 8999.            As I tumbled through the air, I had a partial pleasant life review, as though I was in a movie theatre, and many memories/experiences of my current life up to that point were played out on the movie screen.

    4776.    Laura B NDE     4/25/2020.      NDE 8996.            The only thing I remember next is a woman's voice softly saying to me, 'You're not going to remember anything that has happened here when you wake up.'

  NDE due to heart problems during surgery.   

    4775.    Douglas D NDE     4/25/2020.      NDE 8995.            The presence, whatever it was, seemed to surround me with a deep sense of comfort. It made my panic and fear go away. There was a peaceful, soothing, and familiar warmth.  I was startled by an unexpected, deep baritone Male voice. Out of that divine darkness that voice said: 'It’s not your time.'  At that instant, I was no longer in the dark. I found myself hovering above the canal and looking down at the front of the dock from a distance of about 20 feet in the air. I saw my Dad dragging someone across the dock and to an area of grass just in front of a large evergreen bush. I watched him do this while I was very slowly descending. Then, it dawned on me that the someone was me.  
  NDE due to drowning at age 4.  Shared 63 years later.   

    4774.    Laura K NDE     4/22/2020.      NDE 8994.            I was begging, 'Let me live, please let me live!' I look up from my hands and saw Jesus sitting next to God. God had a round, white cloud in front of Him, so I could not see the front of Him. But I could see part of the side and the back of him. He was sitting down in a tall white chair like Jesus was. Jesus turned to God and asked Him, 'Could she, live?' God motioned something to Jesus and Jesus suddenly stood up and yelled in a loud, almost a celebratory voice, 'He said Yes! He said Yes!' Jesus had both of His hands raised as he happily stood and yelled this. It seemed like he was signaling the news to others.  
  NDE due to car accident.   

    4773.    Sarah A Probable NDE     4/21/2020.      Probable NDE 8993.            Down from the driver's seat came a figure in a black robe. His hood was pulled up, but there wasn't a head inside. The robe itself looked like it was made of decaying black canvas cloth or wool. It was thick and had large threads, although it wasn't jet black like the coach. The robe was dark, but where it was worn down it looked more like a charcoal gray. The figure spoke to me.  
  Probable NDE due to respiratory compromise from COVID-19 infection.  Atypical experience content.  Shared less than two weeks after the experience occurred.   

  4772.    Milly K Possible NDE     .      Possible NDE 8989.            I looked at the wheel again and it was like each spoke or section was filled with a movie screen playing different portions of my life. I had a feeling that even though I was currently alone in this experience, I was very loved and was being encouraged to explore the wheel. I saw some memories playing of my childhood, but I focused on a memory of a visit to a beach on Maui. I was able to 'zoom into' that memory and sit on the beach, feeling and sensing everything. After a bit, I zoomed out and was looking down at the wheel again, deciding where to explore.   
  Possible NDE vs probable anesthesia experience associated with surgery.  Interesting life review.   

    4771.    Yon J NDE     4/5/2020.      NDE 8988.       Non-western NDE from Korea. Original in Korean.     Suddenly, my body was floating on the ceiling and looking down on my body. I saw two doctors and two nurses operating on me while putting my organs in a large basin. I saw my parents crying outside the operating room, but the situation was not scary at all. Suddenly, I was flying through a very dark tunnel at a very high speed. But at the end of the last tunnel, I could see it was very light outside.  
  NDE during surgery.   

    4770.    Véronique M Possible NDE     4/4/2020.      Possible NDE 8985.       From France. Original in French translated to English by Marguy.     On the road, people were standing. I believe that other people were behind the road and that I came from there. The people behind the road could be numerous.  I knew that those people were extremely beautiful, in excellent health because they were radiating beauty and health, and they were well dressed. I was amazed that being well dressed could be important and it wasn't something superficial. Above all, I knew that between them there was a very good atmosphere where all is in perfect harmony. They had a shared love and they had been infinitely kind towards each other and towards myself.  
  Possible NDE associated with general anesthesia.   

    4769.    Maureen K NDE     3/22/2020.      NDE 8982.       Exceptional Experience.     Sensing the rapture that beautiful music evokes as waves is the nearest I may come to describing how breathtaking God appears and how melodiously God resonates. Everything around me was light and ethereal and warm and alive. Light was clearer and brighter than I had ever seen. Colors were beyond vibrant. I felt no fear. I felt no pain. I felt no judgment. I felt no blame. I felt no shame. I felt no fear here! Profound Love and Peace permeated every being everywhere. What I know to be the energy of Angels greeted me with the tenderest warmest energy. I felt embraced by them.  
  NDE due to suicide attempt.  Over 50 pages describe a remarkable NDE and remarkable life changes following the NDE.   

    4768.    Andrew C Probable NDE     3/22/2020.      Probable NDE 8980.            To describe the movement I would say to imagine thin satin fabric in a strong breeze—like how the surface of a flag changes in wind. Constant slightly chaotic fluid waves, and not flapping. Also, it was at least three dimensional. It wasn’t just a surface or image. It could have been a hologram. Other than the colors, this entity could be represented visually with a well-constructed hologram program. Emotively it would be difficult to represent. I am not sure of it’s function, but it has one. Somehow I know that.  
  Probable NDE associated with severe illness.   

      4767.    April G Probable NDE     3/22/2020.      Probable NDE 8979.            I closed my eyes and saw a gray, cloudy-looking background. I clearly remember Danny standing in front of me laughing, like we were sharing a good joke. He said, 'Can you make yourself throw up?' I was so happy to see him! I was relaxed, happy and I laughed back at him saying, 'Of course I can. It's easy - watch!'

I saw our reflection in a big mirror that was in front of me and thought we looked really, really good!! I couldn't believe how good we looked! I began to see my whole life play out in front of me in that mirror. I saw my whole life, everything I had done, and was proud of myself. It was the BEST feeling!

Not in Heaven. There is no dimension to time. All is still. I inhale deeply. I am contented and satisfied in ways I could have never imagined as I absorb this quietude. I have no pain.

My soul arrived on a hill where the meadow was filled with cute, tiny, brilliant flowers. There was a brick house at the foot of the hill. My grandmother and I used to live there when I was age five to to age thirteen before my parents brought me home to live with them. This place was peaceful and I felt at ease. Next, I floated to a dim-greenish colored warehouse-like building where it was crowded with so many people. They were lined up in sequence and marching forward and from my viewpoint, they were not talking to each other. At this moment, I knew I had died.

In that moment, I felt a connection to everything that ever did or ever would exist. It was like seeing the fabric of space and reality. It was like seeing all of creation and feeling unity with it.

He was a mottled, greenish-grey in color, and his skin was leathery. He had wings that draped from his arms, and were attached to his torso like a bat's wings. I never saw his face.

It flapped it's left wing like an injured bird to try and scoot it's body around.
