I was working in a restaurant (second shift) and was cleaning up. I climbed on the chair to put something on a high shelf (as I did every night) and when I was going to come down, I slipped. I thought one of the bars was going to go right through me and was sure I was going to die.


I saw a man (like a father figure, although my father was alive at the time) next to a huge screen like a TV. I was shown my life on this screen - it wasn't like a movie - it was more like one picture after another but there were hundreds of pictures in this second or two.


The fatherly figure communicated to me that my life wasn't over yet, that I hadn't lived long enough and then it was over.

Background Information:

Gender:    Female

NDE Elements:

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?      I was on a chair that had the back off & had 2 wooden spikes for the back of the chair still there. I was coming down from the chair & thought one of the spikes was going to go right through me starting at my crotch.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?      No

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?      Uncertain     Just the fatherly figure.

Did you see an unearthly light?      No

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?     No

The experience included:      Life review

Did scenes from the future come to you?      No

Did you come to a border or point of no return?      I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will   The fatherly figure communicated to me that my life wasn't over yet, that I hadn't lived long enough and then it was over.

God, Spiritual and Religion:

What was your religion prior to your experience?   Moderate   was raised catholic

What is your religion now?      Liberal   independent spiritualist
