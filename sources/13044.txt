  		              		Experience Description   

    That day I was going to my boyfriend's friend's house.  It was late in the evening and I remember getting into the car and lying my head on his shoulder. Seat belts weren't required, so I was able to sit in the middle of the seat as we drove home. We were coming around a sharp curve and he had lost control of the car. I didn't realize he had taken  drugs  earlier, so his driving was impaired. We were headed over a very high cliff without trees. But, instead of going over that cliff, the car slammed head long into a huge tree that just suddenly appeared. It confounded the people that lived across the street from where the accident happened.  They swore up and down there had never been a  tree there.

   The next thing I remember, I felt the crash, but yet, I didn't feel the crash.  I was  standing above my body hearing my boyfriend  cry out, 'She's not dead! She's Not Dead!' I saw the ambulance driver zip me up in the black bag  as he pronounced me dead.  David continued screaming, 'She's not dead! She can't be dead!' 

   Then, I saw the brightest light. It is hard to  describe because I've never seen it here on earth. The light  did not hurt my eyes. I was  overwhelmed as  I felt in my soul what  I had missed. I  wanted to know peace and joy.  My life had been chaos and I was living in such pain; emotionally, spiritually, and physically.  I knew the only place I could get that peace and joy was with God, but I was still trying to discover exactly how to go after it. I remember standing there and I could hear music. I could hear the angels singing and praising God.  I started to go towards them and then I felt a very loving hand touch my shoulders.  I heard a Voice telling me that I had to come back snf that my purpose wasn't fulfilled. I remember saying, 'I don't want to go back! I want to stay. Please let me stay.'  I tried to go back towards that beautiful, brilliant light and again the hand touched my shoulder.  Again, the Voice said, 'Your time is not up yet. You have to go back.' 

   The next thing I remember is three days later when I woke up from a coma. The doctors could not understand how I live through that car wreck, without sustaining any injuries.  Yet, I died. 

   I tried to tell my story, but at the time nobody wanted to hear it.   I know what I saw. I felt that I was in the place  we go when we die.  I can't wait to go home, but until then, I will serve My Father Here.     

Background Information:       

Gender:   	Female  

Date NDE Occurred:   	 1977-78  

NDE Elements:       

  At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes  Accident         Clinical death (cessation of breathing or heart function)   When this happened I was coming home with my boyfriend at the time he was driving no seat belts. He drove off a cliff. 
  
  Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  I really can't remember. I have flashes but I'm not sure all the memories have surfaced yet. But I know that the experience happened. I know that I died and went to heaven. I also know that I saw the EMTs zip up the bag and I heard David screaming that I wasn't dead.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  
  
  How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal.   I believe I was given an opportunity to go either way. I Heard a Voice saying, 'You have a choice, choose life.' I believe when I saw heaven, that deep in my soul/spirit, that is what I wanted. I wanted to go back home because I am a child of God. I am one of his elect  
  
At what time during the experience were you at your highest level of consciousness and alertness?         The height of my alertness was when I entered into the peaceful kingdom of God  

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Faster than usual  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     As I said from the time that I heard them zip the bag up to the time I saw the brilliant light, it seemed like eternity but yet it seemed to happen in  less than a blink of an eye  
  
Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

  Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       I'm not sure on this question. I know that I always believed heaven to be a beautiful, peaceful place where our father lives and that we will go back to.  I really didn't talk about it. I thought it might have been a dream.  I didn't talk about it for years. I finally  told my mom. She has strong faith and she's now with the Lord. She told me that God was giving me a great gift by showing me what I could have  
  
  Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      After this experience, if I had chosen correctly, I would have had better hearing of my Lord that he never gave up on me. I can hear my Lord's voice but at the time I really didn't know it but I knew that I was drawn to it  
  
Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

  Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         Uncertain     I'm not sure if it was a tunnel. I know there was a space between watching them zip the bag up on my body and the time that I saw the greatest light that one could ever imagine. It was silent for a second. 
  
Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   Again the light I saw was brighter than anything I could ever describe on Earth yet it did not hurt my eyes it wasn't inviting loving peaceful kind of light that was brilliant glowed it shined it was breathtaking there's no way to describe the beauty  

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm.     Around me was not of this world. It was a spiritual world; it was God's Kingdom. There was no earthly anything there because it was all spiritual - the angels and our Lord Our Father  
  
  What emotions did you feel during the experience?         The emotions I felt or peace so much deep loving peace,  love, and joy. I felt emotions that I still can't  find words for, that are so beautiful. I never felt this much peace in all my earthly life and that's what I yearn for is that feeling of peace that is indescribable  
  
Did you have a feeling of peace or pleasantness?         Incredible peace or pleasantness  

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt no longer in conflict with nature  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         No       

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No     I think the only experience is the word choice you have a choice this is what will happen if you take this road and this is what will happen if you take this road  

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

  Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  I did not want to come back. I wanted to stay with that piece and that loved that I was overwhelmingly filled with I asked not to come back but I was told that my purpose wasn't for failed that I had to
