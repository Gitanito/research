    On 2/2/12, my husband was driving in our 1986 Camry.  We picked up 5.5 gallon tanks of propane for heating my greenhouse. The tanks were placed in the trunk. We entered a left turn lane when the light just turned red.  We were behind a tall, nursing home transport bus and about 6 feet behind the bus.  We were hit from behind by a large car doing 35 miles per hour.  The person did not put on their breaks.My husband's foot came off the breakand we were pushed under the bus.  The bumper of the bus was seconds away from decapatating us both.  

I screamed, 'we are going to die!' and started leaving my body. A calm came over me. I then heard a female voice say, 'You will not die'. Husband managed to get his foot on the break at that point.   I screamed, 'Mom, is that you ?!'  I then realized that it was a voice from the spiritual realm.  A sense of calmness enveloped me, despite major head trauma. 

We were truly blessed that the force of the impact did not explode the propane tanks. 

  After hearing the spiritual voice, at that very moment my life as I knew it changed forever.  Four months after the accident, I could no longer work, due to a massive post-concussion migraine syndrome. I retired from my job with much sadness.  I had a 100% reality shift.  I have had a remarkable five years since the accident. My daughter's friends describe me as a different person. There is not enough space to share how remarkable my life has become.  

  Of note, as a child, I was gifted both intuitively, spiritually  and empathically. After this near death experience, my blessings increased a thousand percent.

     				  					Experience Description 7863  					</p>  					My husband and I were coming home from picking up some propane tanks that we put in the trunk. We use propane to heat a greenhouse.  As we were waiting for the stoplight to turn green, I shifted my body sideways to talk to my husband.  Then there was a massive impact where everything happened in slow motion. I remember tumbling in my seat and hitting my head.  This was my second motor vehicle that left me with a massive concussion.  As the bus bumper reached the windshield, I screamed, 'We are going to die!' and started to leave my body.  I heard a woman's voice say, 'You will not die'.  I thought it was either my deceased mother or mother-in-law. As I went back into my body, I knew the voice I heard was the Virgin Mary. I call her Mother Mary. 

This is the second time in my life that I heard and knew that this was her voice.  As a small child, I heard her voice and felt her presence. By the Grace of God, the propane did not explode.  Life has not been the same since.  I could not communicate to anyone what happened, no words could describe that a miracle had happened.  I am not the same person today as I was in that car almost four years ago.
