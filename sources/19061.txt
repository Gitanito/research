the really important thing to know
because if you&#39;re out into the Stars I
remember last year just before I had to
take this trip to Australia and I was
laying on the beach and I was with a
friend and it was butyl you see the
whole Milky Way galaxy on the outer I
was on the Outer Banks and I was out
there and we were talking about this
stuff and there&#39;s someone who had never
seen one of these objects and suddenly
in the Milky Way an object about that
big at arm&#39;s length was huge it was
pretty close and pretty big materialized
and it was this beautiful kind of
crimson ruby red but it was live it was
like it was living it was like this
thing that was living and it moved and
with the whole distance of the Milky Way
galaxy
it wasn&#39;t an instantaneous thing it was
there for a little while I don&#39;t know if
anyone else on earth saw it but we saw
we were looking straight up and it was
like it was alive the sky was iliza
object was alive and I realized it was
going right in the direction of
Australia which a few days later I was
wheels up to Australia so and I think it
was I told my wife I said I think they
were telling me you know bon voyage and
we&#39;ll be with you there so it was a
beautiful beautiful experience and it
can happen that easily and that quickly
you know if you open up to it and
ultimately that the central science of
all of this yes there&#39;s materials
there&#39;s electronics there&#39;s
communication modalities but the central
technology and understanding is
understanding yourself your thoughts
your mind the meditative state and how
that can be used to make contact and in
deep meditation you can unpretty much
unfurl unravel any mystery you wish to
in the Vedic tradition there&#39;s something
called Ritambhara Pragya written
and it&#39;s a level of consciousness where
it&#39;s very very deep it&#39;s just sort of
like this side of unbounded Samadhi
state where writ tom is located where if
you put your awareness you can ask and
kind of intend to know anything now of
course I guess that the Supreme Being
knows all things at all times but an
individual can know this OP this thing
that thing this object you know one at a
time or maybe if you&#39;re really brilliant
hundred things at a time or a million
but not everything but I think that&#39;s
the wellspring of intuitive intuition
and that&#39;s resides within every single
person so it&#39;s like this conscious
quantum hologram where all of us are
part of this conscious hologram and
every single one of us even though
unique at the deep level of
consciousness we&#39;re plugged in to that
unbounded and if we travel to that
that&#39;s where we become one and if we
begin to experience that deeply enough
we can begin to experience that even
while we&#39;re walking around driving down
the road and my experience in the ER I
mean I just have a lot of experiences
where it would just be this intuitive
flash and I would know someone had a
brain tumor or I would know someone had
something completely hidden with no
symptomatology and I would act on it and
the nurses call me a warlock but
they were awesome in North Carolina I
said what doesn&#39;t he&#39;s hillbilly nurses
were great but they but they would say
dr. bears warlock and um and so we would
have these experiences at one time a man
came in and I just wanna do this I don&#39;t
care if you&#39;re an airline pilot a
software engineer a business executive
bus driver a doctor or whatever you are
if you learn these principles of
consciousness and the cities that go
with it these abilities it will be very
valuable in your life
and there was this man that came in and
he was a 26 year old guy with couple
kids and he had the flu it seemed like
the flu is flu season and I looked at
him and I looked and I thought God he&#39;s
got a big brain tumor and didn&#39;t have
any symptoms of a neurological insult at
all and I turned to the nurse and she
was fat bubbles lip bubbles
she walked like this and I have a
bouffant and I turned to bubbles I said
I need a stat cat scan of the brain
she said well doctor he&#39;s only got the
flu I said just do it though is that my
mantra just do it I thank God I didn&#39;t
have to go through a bureaucracy
insurance company or government and I
just did just do it so he did it the
radiologist calls back an emergency call
back and radiologists usually don&#39;t you
know they don&#39;t bother
this guy&#39;s got a astrocytoma that&#39;s like
a pancake over his brain and it&#39;s
herniating his brain stem well the the
brain stem going down through the
foramen magnum gave him the fever the
chills they&#39;re not all his symptoms but
there were no focal neurological
symptoms and so he went to emergency
neurosurgery lived as you seem
periodically come in occasionally and
but it was totally I&#39;d say almost anyone
who would in fact the neurosurgeon said
how would you even think to get a cat
scan because they just seemed like he
had the flu I said well I just had a
hunch I couldn&#39;t say to him but I
actually remote viewed and sense that
there was this thing but it&#39;s like you
know how golden retrievers have been
trained to find mo
and stuff like humans we have this
ability whether you&#39;re a scientist or a
doctor or a pilot or whatever you are
and we we&#39;ve shut ourselves off from our
birthright of being conscious
enlightened beings and I&#39;ll it&#39;s so easy
to get back to that you sit quietly do
nothing do a meditative process and
confirm that you can do these things and
it will it will just unfold and it&#39;s not
like every single day is like that but
it happens enough that you know life
becomes wonderful magical and I would
really encourage people to do that and
when you&#39;re doing this contact work with
ETS it means that you can do this under
the stars with three or four or five
people that you&#39;re close to
remember what dr. John found at
Princeton if someone is in a state of
unified awareness and are bonded and
they are intending with thought it has
an exponentially greater effect than one
person by themselves and so that&#39;s the
power of a group of people doing this so
long as they&#39;re harmonious and not
fighting like a bunch of wild cats and
there&#39;s coherence in the group so if you
can create coherence in a group it&#39;s
incredibly powerful because it&#39;s orders
of magnitude it&#39;s an exponential
increase in the power of the thought the
consciousness and the effect to make
contact and somehow someway these
civilizations will respond if you let
them
you
