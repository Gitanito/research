Slenker for her books on "private Physiology for Girls" and for "Diana."  The last known issue is November 14, 1885, but the Carrier Dove, January 1887, lists it among its exchanges.  Kates (1845-1922) went on to publish a series of pamphlets on spiritualism for the NSA, and was the object of a lawsuit in 1890 in which his divorced wife and their children sued to rid themselves of his name on the grounds that long before he had sought a divorce from his wife he was intimate with a "Dr." Zaida Brown, the psychometric and test medium, who became his second wife.  The result of the petition is unknown.  LOC; University of Rochester.
