I felt my body being separated from my own self. I drifted toward the ceiling, and the monitor line went flat. I saw unearthly beings, but they looked as if they were not trying to hurt me. One minute later, a bright light fell above me. Through a pitch-black tunnel, I drifted up to that light. Near one foot before the light 'swallowed' me up, I suddenly start to fall back to my body. I call this a strange vision/dream, but it was cool.
