PREFACE.
w
Wrrn many, to whom swift writing is in much request, a system which, with the legibility of
of common writing, would unite in a considerable degree the brevity and quickness of Short Hand,
has long been a desideratum; the author flatters himself that his readers will find these useful
properties combined to the fullest extent in the system contained in this treatise. Facilography, as
may be seen by the contents of this work, is a system of easy writing, not in Short Haud, but of
writing every word, and every letter without any onission, in half the space and in one third
the time required for Running Hand; which is effected by substituting new characters for the al
phabet, and when the alphabet has once been perfectly learnt; the letters used in Facilography are
as legible as the letters in common writing, and are made with one third of the trouble; this is
demonstrated in the second plate of this treatise, by which it will be seen, that to form the
twenty-six letters of the running-hand alphabet, one hundred and twenty moves or inflections of the
pen are required: but in Facilography the twenty-six letters are formed with only forty moves of
the pen, and written in regular straight lines; hair strokes to connect the letters very seldom oc
cur; and in the five vowels, each can be formed by a single stroke of the pen.
Some persons may perhaps say, that the writing being contained in half the space that is re
quired for the common hand, is but of little consequence; this property, however, is a greater re
commendation than might at first be imagined, for example, is it not often found very unpleasant
to Merchants and others, whose business requires them to carry large books for their memorandums,
a
iv. | PREFACE.
f
The three properties before mentioned, as the constituents of an expeditious character, have
been united to the fullest extent in the letters of the Facilographic alphabet, but in a very few in
stances, where some of the characters might have been more simple in form; but had a greater
degree of simplicity in this respect been attempted, they would not have preserved their linear
manner of being written, nor have been capable of their present easy and flowing junction with the
other characters; he therefore thought it better in some measure to reject the first of these princi
ples, rather than by retaining it lose the advantages resulting from the union of the two last men
tioned. Moreover, it may easily be proved, that an attempt to gain expedition, by carrying the
principle of simplicity in the form of the letters beyond a certain extent, will generally defeat its
own purpose, and this must inevitably be the case, whenever simplicity of form in the character is
purchased at the expence of the other two essential properties already mentioned; but, however,
this extreme has been carefully avoided in this new system of writing, and the characters of the
Facilographic alphabet nevertheless are equally simple in form, and owing to the easy and flowing
manner in which they combine, and in consequence of their being written in a lineal manner, are
expressed with greater facility and expedition than the alphabets of some of the most modern sys
tems of Stenography, which, hitherto, have been considered as paragons of perfection in that de
partment ofscience; that this is really the case, any person may soon be convinced by only refering
to the schemes for their alphabets, given in the systems alluded to, and comparing them with the
characters which constitute the Facilographic alphabet.
The characters before alluded to, as being less simple than the rest, are the characters which
stand for a, g, and ar, as given in the line No. 2, of the alphabet; to a superficial observer, these
characters might be supposed to require more time in their formation, than any of the characters
which are found in the treatises of short hand already before the public; but the author has ex
perimentally proved the reverse to be the case, and that a penman, moderately expert, can
make from one hundred and twenty, to one hundred and fifty of either of these characters in the
space of one minute; and of other of the characters, from one hundred and eighty, to considerably
upwards oftwo hundred per minute.
The easy and flowing manner in which these characters combine, gives them a decided pre
ference over those which might appear more simple in form, but which do not possess the property
of combining in flowing and lineal manner; the first way of making the character for a, which, if
made by itself, takes three motions of the pen to form it, but will, when combined with the other
characters, scarcely ever take more than two movements of the pen to form it; as an example of
this, the word Martyr, Plate No. 3, is given, by which it will be seen, that this word is written
with only ten motions of the pen, but if the letters were written separate, they would require ele
ven motions of the pen; the reason of this is, that the last stroke of the a is formed by making the
upstroke of the letter r; in the same plate, and in the word Paris, the letter a takes no more than
one stroke of the pen to form it; Paris, thus expressed in Facilography, needs no more than seven
s
PREFACE, v
motions of the pen, but if the characters were written apart, would take nine distinct motions of the
pen, and in all words of a similar construction, this character for the Facilographic a will be made
by one stroke of the pen; but as the author has given two different ways of making the character
for a, both of which are used with the utmost ease, and has given examples and instruction for the
application of both; the one of which is always made by one single stroke of the pen; therefore the
student may use either of them with equal facility; and in reference to the character for 9, when
ever it ends any word, it is always written with only two motions of the pen.
It may be observed, that the second chapter contains the first lesson; the fourth chapter the
second lesson; the fifth chapter the third; the sixth chapter the fourth lesson; the seventh con
tains the fifth lesson; and the eighth chapter the sixth lesson: the third, ninth, and tenth chapters
contain a variety of curious remarks on this kind of writing, which, though not constituting any
part of the six lessons, will be found to convey much useful information, and will serve as answers
to a diversity of thoughts which might suggest themselves to the mind of the pupil: the postscript
which is added, shewing a speedy method of acquiring a rapid manner of writing the Facilographic
characters; the pupil would do well to attend to the instruction therein contained as soon as he has
gone through the first lesson; but those who wish, after having completed the first lesson, may
proceed without delay to the second, (which exhibits the mode of combining the letters one with
another) and so on progressively through the six lessons; and may attend to the particulars con
tained in the third, ninth, and tenth chapters, and the postscript afterwards.
As tautology is unavoidable in a work of this nature, the author hopes the candour of his
readers will excuse any thing of the kind which may be met with in this treatise.
In consequence of the great ease and expedition with which any thing may be written in full in
Facilography, it will naturally be suggested to the mind, that the same characters nay easily be ap
plied as a system of Stenography; this is the case... An appendix is given, shewing the application
of the same to a system of short-hand: every thing really useful in Stenography has been carefully
selected; besides which, a great variety of matter of real utility has been introduced, as will be
quite obvious on perusal; the rules first elucidated by proper examples in prose, are afterwards
recapitulated in verse; from the well known fact, that whatever is presented to the mind in the
form of poetry, is more pleasant, strikes the imagination more forcibly, and is easily remembered for
a long time; from the great facility thus afforded to retain the instructions, the author is inclined
to believe, that many of his readers will commit to memory all the rules given in verse; but those
who may not be disposed to do so, will find it amply worth their while to fix well in memory the
rule for the prepositions,” and that for the terminations; or if only the rule for the terminations be
* In the third section of the first chapter. + In the second section of the second chapter of the Appendix.

iv. PREFACE.
perfectly retained, by the aid of this, and omitting the vowels, they will have a short-hand
equal to any ; and one thing very essential in short writing, possessing an advantage not to be
found in any other system; namely, that the words are written in straight lines, as is done in com
mon writing, which renders whatever is written far more clear and legible, than if the letters were
joined in such a manner, that one letter would go under the other, underneath the line, or be car
ried above the line for several letters together, as is the case in other systems of Stenography; but
those who will commit to memory the whole of the rules, will possess one of the most perfect sys
tems of short-hand hitherto extant.
And with respect to the rules given in verse, they are not intended as any display of po
etical talent, but only with a wish to render the work more useful; therefore the author hopes his
readers will not criticise the poetry; for it is more difficult for the muse to descend to the minutiae
of art, than to indulge in the sublime flights of imagination; and it would have been easier to have
written an Epic Poem, than to have elucidated the art ofStenography in poetry.

INTRODUCTION,
ALTHOUGH I am persuaded that many of my readers will understand this
system by inspection; yet in order to render it clear to every one, I have given
such rules and explanations, which if duly observed, cannot fail of enabling the
learner to acquire the whole perfectly in the course of a few days.

Directions for learning the Alphabet.
-
Having provided yourself with paper, or a copy book sufficiently large to
contain the whole alphabet in one line; rule any number of lines at pleasure hori
zontally, at about half an inch apart ; and then rule from top to bottom of the
*
paper thirty-three lines. . . . . . . . . . . . .
This done, refer to Plate No. 1, Lesson 1st. placing the copper-plate copy be
fore you, and beginning with the first letter of the Facilographic alphabet, proceed
regularly on to the end thereof, imitating as nearly as possible each character, and
at the same time you form each letter, call it by its proper name; by this means
the imagination will assist the memory, and in many instances the whole of the
alphabet may by diligent application, be perfectly acquired in the space of one day.
Note. In the third line of the first lesson, which begins with the word “or,”
some of the characters are repeated with a trifling difference of form ; this line ex
hibits the slight variation those letters sometimes undergo in combination with others,
in order to preserve ease and uniformity. It should be observed, that in this, as in
common running-hand, the motion of the pen is uniformly from the left towards the .
right hand. - - - - - - - - - - -

son, eight of the letters in very large characters: the first of these is the character
for b, in forming of which, the pen is first placed on the paper at the point marked
a, and carried forward to b at the top, and then slanting down from b unto c. The
second is d'; in the formation of this character, the pen is first laid on at the point
marked a, and carried down to b; from b the pen is carried up to c, which com
pletes the letter.
The third character is for s, and is formed by carrying the pen from the point
marked a, quite round to the point marked b, which completes the letter. N. B.
This is the kind of s to be used immediately after those letters which would re
quire the connexion of a hair stroke if the character for s, which is given in the
second line of the first lesson were used: but this is fully explained in the second
Section of Plate No. 2, and also in Plate No. 3, in the word “universality,” and
several others as may be seen by inspection; by the numerous examples given in
the plates, it will be seen that this kind of s adapts itself with much neatness and
facility when joined to a, to w, or to u, as in the word “zealously.” See Lesson
Fourth, Plate No. 3.
When s is the final letter, it may, in most cases, be expressed by a single stroke
of the pen carried upwards in a diagonal direction: see Section No. 4, of the se
cond Lesson, in Plate No. 1, and the second Section of Plate No. 2, where s is com
bined in almost every way that can possibly occur. -
Fourth Character. In forming the w, the pen is first placed on the point a, and
carried forward to b, by one curved stroke. - ~ * -
The Fifth. The character for f. is formed by placing the pen first on the
point a, and by one stroke to carry it in a curved manner to b.
The Sixth. The character for m, is formed by placing the pen on the point
a, and carrying it from a up to b, and from b down to c.
Seventh. The character for p, is made by putting the pen first on the point a,
and carrying it down to b, and then from b up to c.
The Eighth is the character for k, in forming this, the pen is carried from the
point marked a down to b, and from b the pen is brought with a fine stroke nearly
up to the point a, where both down-stroke and up-stroke are joined. -
Before the learner proceeds to the second lesson, he should make himself expert
in forming all the letters of the alphabet, and be perfectly able to write them with
out having the copy before him, so that he may with ease distinguish them wherever
they occur. -
4
These directions, I believe, will be found to convey precise and clear ideas how
to form the alphabet.
It is strongly recommended to the student, most particularly those who have
not the advantage of being instructed by the Author himself, that fifteen or twenty
pages of the alphabet, at least, should be written, or should this not sufficiently
impress it on the memory, more copies should be written until the Facilographic
characters are perfectly as familiar both to the hand and to the eye, as the letters of
the common running hand; every one wishing to retain perfection in Facilography,
will find it amply worth his while implicitly to observe this injunction: for to every
reflecting mind, it is an obvious fact, that although our progress at first be slow in
the acquirement of science, and should we even spend considerable time in acquir
ing, in a perfect manner the elements thereof; yet by making ourselves completely
perfect in the rudiments; every impediment is hereby removed, our progress will
be easy, pleasant, and certain, every difficulty vanishes before us, and the rapid
proficiency we afterwards make, much more than compensates for the time and
trouble we bestowed to attain perfection in the first principles; and there are no
doubt now living, thousands whose hasty impatience, or unconquerable indolencc,
would never let them sufficiently apply to acquire the rudiments of any art or
science presented to them, and who have therefore given them up as useless or im
practicable; but it is hoped that every purchaser of this treatise, will have tho
roughly resolved to follow the Instructions it contains, and by so doing, may rest
well assured, that he will have the satisfaction of becoming a proficient in, and pro
fessing every advantage that can result from this expeditious system of writing.
Third Section.
In order that every person who learns this system may perfectly understand in
all cases how the characters should be placed, it is necessary to make the follow
ing remarks:—When there is occasion to speak of some of the Facilographic cha
racters being under the line, it is not meant that they are to be really placed under
neath it, but the notion intended to be conveyed, is that the characters are begun
on the line, or a very little distance above it, and that the other part of them
finishes, or is made under it, just in the same manner as the letters f, g, ss, p, q,
3y, and the long s and the long z in the small alphabet of common running-hand;
and when it is said that a character is to be carried above the line, it is meant by
a long up-stroke, after the principles of b d h k l of the small alphabet of com
5
mon writing, but j is the only letter in Facilography which has a long up-stroke
above the line.
To render every thing clear and easy to persons who learn this system of writ
ing, I will as briefly as possible give such directions as will prevent any mistake in
the manner of placing the Facilographic characters.
The characters begun on the line, or a little above the line and finished under
it, are those which stand for g, h, the long k, the l, p, v, y, z and characters for
qu and for ph.
The characters written entirely upon the line, are those which stand for b c d
e fj m n or s t w ar, long a, long i, and the long u, the characters for gh, and that
for sh; these are always written on the line, with the exception only of the three
characters for long u, e, and for o: when either e or o comes next after the charac
ters for h, for qu, and for y, both the e and the o, in this case, are each an up-stroke
joined with and brought from the h, or qu, or from the y, right up to the line, and
so united with the next succeeding letters without ever lifting up the pen; or when
the e comes next after, and is joined to the character for m, it may be begun on the
line and made as a downs-troke. See the manner in which it is written in the words
pine, fine, &c. in plate No. 1. - -
The only cases in which the long w is begun on the line and finishes under, are
in joining it to the characters for b, f, m, and sometimes with that for n. The rea
son of the exceptions in these three vowels, is, that the writing is by these means,
rendered more free and flowing, and almost in every instance, a stroke of the
pen is saved. * -
One thing to be remarked is, that when some of the characters are termed
long, or short, it is not meant that they are to be sounded long or short, it only
refers to the magnitude of the characters, and that one requires a longer or a shorter
time to write it as contrasted with the other letters of the same name, but these
particulars will be rendered perfectly easy and familiar by copying the examples
contained in the plates.
CHAPTER III.
-ºm
General Observations on the Letters.
-ºm--
ALTHOUGH the foregoing chapter contains all that is necessary for the first
lesson, nevertheless, as in a work so novel in its nature, a variety of ideas might
suggest themselves to the mind of the reader, I have been induced in this third
chapter to make some remarks on each letter, that every particular may be eluci
dated in the clearest manner.
a—I have given two ways of making this letter, the first is contained in the
line No. 2 of the alphabet, to which I give the name of long a, in contrast to the
other; no further direction is necessary for the long a, only to make it with a good
free rounding-turn both at top and bottom: the way of making the second a, con
tained in line No. 3 of the alphabet, is made by a single touch of the pen, it is
used precisely in the same manner as the character which is called short i.
b–It will be seen by inspecting Plate No. 1, that there are two characters for
b: the character for b, given in the third line of the alphabet, is the b which
should be used when m and some other of the consonants precede it, which require
the b to be thus formed, in order that the junction of the two letters may be easy
and flowing; but when a vowel precedes, the b as given in the second line of the al
phabet should be used; but this will be perfectly plain from the examples given
in the plates: c, f, and w, are made on similar principles, which have been ex
plained in the first Lesson. --
d—This letter, as may be seen by the examples, varies its form so as to adapt
itself to all the letters with which it is combined ; when it begins a word, it retains
the form given to it in the second line of the alphabet; but when a c.f.g. m n or 2
comes next after d, the d is only a little round loop, the last turn of which finishes
towards the right hand, as in the word admonition. See Plate No. 4, and Example
No. 25.
The round s is somewhat similar, but may always be known by the manner in
which the last turn finishes, which is exhibited in a large character in the second
7
Section of the first Lesson; the round s in plate No. 2, and in the words genius
and usury, with several other examples in this work, will sufficiently exemplify
this difference between these two letters.
e—This letter is sometimes a down-stroke. and sometimes an up-stroke, as
suits the convenience of the preceding or succeeding letter with which it is joined;
when an up-stroke is fine, but when formed by a down-stroke, it is broad and
strong at the top, but goes off finer at the lower part. Whenever e is written in
combination with n under the line, it should be a very small character, as in the
word munerary, &c. See the examples in the plates. -
f—The use of the f given in the third line of the alphabet, is explained by
the example of writing the word profane. See Plate No. 1.
g—The author has given two ways of making this letter, the g given in the
third line of the alphabet, may be used when g ends any word.
NotE—The same g as last spoken of, is used as a termination, when used in
short-hand, as may be seen in the Appendix. * * *
The g in the second line of the alphabet, (as may be seen in the examples) com
bines with much ease and neatness, with every letter, and in every situation; how
ever, care should be taken not to make the upper part too large ; the top of this
letter is a very small curve, which curve is not half so large as any of the other
curved characters.
h—This letter is formed by a fine up-stroke and a straight down-stroke, the
loop should be very marrow.
i—This letter in all cases, is only a short strong down-stroke; when two i's
meet together, they may both be well expressed by only making one short thick.’
down-stroke with a dot over it. The dot is also used for i in all combinations, and
by way of distinction, call it short i ; its application is fully shewn in the second
Lesson. - - -
j—The first character for this letter, is a strong down-stroke, and should be full
twice the length of first mentioned character for i; the second way of making this
letter is by placing the pen on the line, and carrying it downwards, and then an
up stroke crossing the down-stroke brought right up to the line, completes this
letter.
k—Two forms for k are given, the first of which is distinguished by the name
of short k, and should always be used at the beginning of words; the other in the
third line of the alphabet is what is called long k, the first part of which is a down
stroke, and the second, which completes the letter is an up-stroke, and is generally
D
, ; * *
8
used in the middle of words from its distinctness and facility of combining both
with preceding and succeeding letters; however, if care be taken to form the short
k carefully, it may be used in the middle of words as well as the long k, as may
be seen by inspecting the miscellanies Plate No. 3, and word No. 3, where I have
used the short k in the word mankind.
l—Consists of a strong down-stroke and a fine stroke, the loop should be very
narrow, as it is not necessary to give the looped parts of the letters in Facilography,
the length and roundness which is given to the looped parts of the letters in com
mon running-hand: but when p immediately precedes l, the l should in this case
be made a little longer than usual. -
m—This letter consists of a fine up-stroke, and a strong down-stroke, and
should always be made somewhat larger than any of the vowels to which it shall be
joined, that its distinctness may be in all cases preserved ; to write em only, re
quires the lower part of the upstroke of the m to be bent a little hollow towards
the left side; however, this and other combinations of this letter will easily and
practically be learned by copying the examples given in the plates.
Note.—As the character for m just spoken of, is made somewhat longer than
the other characters for the reason above mentioned, therefore in applying the Fa
cilographic characters to a system of short-hand, whenever the letter m occurs, in
all cases where the vowels a, e, and o are not inserted in the first part of the m,
the character for m as given in the third line of the alphabet in Plate No. 1, should
be used, which is precisely the reverse of the character for w, and consequently is
made by one stroke of the pen, and should always be made full twice as much
curved as the character for f. so that the one cannot be mistaken for the other.
n—Is a short straight stroke by drawing the pen from the left towards the
right-hand. When two n’s meet in a word, make the n twice its usual length.
o—This letter is made by a single stroke of the pen, sometimes it is a down
stroke, and sometimes an up-stroke, as may best suit for its junction, with the pre
ceding or the succeeding letters, when it is a down-stroke, it is made strong and
broad, particularly towards the bottom; when an up-stroke, it is more fine, but in
both cases it is curved and inclined the same way.
p—It is formed by a strong down-stroke, and a fine up-stroke,it is the reverse of
the character used for m, only a little longer and much narrower.
qu–The author uses only one character to represent both these letters; for
in the composition of our words, q and u are inseparable; the character he has first
given, should always beformed by a very strong down-stroke, as much of the charac
ter being below the line as there is above; the second character for quis quite obvious.
9
r—This letter is formed by a fine up-stroke and a down-stroke rather stronger,
the loop should be very narrow.
s—The s given in the second line of the alphabet, is formed by a down-stroke and
an up-stroke, is just the reverse of the character for the r, and looks very elegant
when used as the first letter of any word which begins a sentence. The first s is a
fine up-stroke.
t—The down-stroke of this letter should not be made strong, but fine and
quite straight, both the up-stroke and down-stroke should be as close together as
possible.
u—The author has given two ways for making this letter, the first of which he
distinguishes by the name of long u, is contained in line No. 2, of the alphabet,
and is formed by a down-stroke rather strong, and a fine up-stroke, the character
for this letter should be well preserved, and a good round turn should be given
to it at the bottom; this character may always be written on the line if the
writer desires it; but in a few instances where the writing is rendered more
handsome and flowing by beginning it on the line, and carrying it downward a lit
tle, the author has done so, viz. in joining it with b f m, and sometimes with n, as
will be seen in the plates. The short u is made a single straight down-stroke, broad
at top, but tapering off at the bottom, and is applied in the same way as the dot is
when used as the character for i, and will be best learnt by studying the examples
in the plates.
w—The wo should always be full twice as much curved as the character used
for the letter c, this may be seen by comparing the two letters as given in the al
phabet.
a.—This letter is somewhat similar to the r and the b when joined together,
only that it is not quite so long, the two looped parts are closer together, and the
whole of it is made above the real or imaginary line, or which words are written:
the second character for a is quite obvious.
3y—Is always made by a down-stroke of the pen, and is always below the line,
and the lowest part very strong and broad.
z—This letter is somewhat similar in form to the m, only that the upper part is
not more than one half as large, and that the down-stroke is continued below the
line quite straight, so the difference is so striking, that the one cannot be mistaken
for the other. -
The characters for ph, gh, and sh, will be quite obvious to the student, who has
perfectly learned the other characters, for like them, these three, are also formed
10
by the motion of the pen being continued in a direction from left to right. The
character for th, as given in the eighth plate, will be found useful. By the twenty
six characters of the Facilographic alphabet, the writing may be performed in one
third the usual time, but in many instances wherein the supernumerary characters
are used the words will be written in one-fourth, or even one-fifth the time required
for common writing, therefore, as expedition is so greatly increased, it is presumed
that the diligent student will avail himself of the advantages resulting frem the
use of these additional characters.
CHAPTER IV.
.S. E. C. O N D L E S S ON.
IN this lesson is given the combination of the vowels with one another; this
will familiarize the mind to the appearance of the vowels, as connected with each
other in the rest of the lessons; the learner should still bear in his mind that both
e and o are made more black and strong when they are formed by a downstroke of
the pen; but more fine and thin when formed as up-strokes, but yet not so fine as
if they were only hair-strokes used to connect letters one with another. It is scarcely
necessary to add, that in order to form them when they are up-strokes, that the pen
is laid on the paper on the line, and so carried upwards, and that when they are
formed as down-strokes, the pen is applied to the paper a small distance above the
line and then carried down to the line.
The second section of this lesson exhibits the union of such of the vowels as
will admit of being combined in a different manner to what they are in the first
section of this lesson.
In the third section of the lesson are given six words, viz. pine, fine, give, gave,
define and profane ; in order to elucidate the manner of expressing e final, by
which it will be seen that in many instances e final may be expressed without any
additional trouble; as is very obvious in the words give and gave, where the e is de
noted by only making the up-stroke of the v a little longer, and giving to it a small
11 *
degree of curvature at the top, so that the e is written as quickly as if the v only
had been expressed.
The words profane and palfrey, shew the reason and use of the two forms of
the f, as given in the first lesson.
Fourth Section.—The line marked A of this section, is chiefly designed to ex
emplify the manner in which u should be combined with the letters b, i, j, k, r, and
with tº the combination of these six letters with e and with o being here repeated,
is only by way of contrast, and clearly proves that u may be united with i j k r and
t, in such a manner as though each two letters were only one character, be made
with nearly as little trouble, and be so thoroughly distinct, that they could not be
taken for any other letters than what they are intended for.
In the line marked A is also shewn the combination of the round looped s, with
letter a. The fourth line marked C, shews the way of combining several letters,
which are expressed in running-hand in the line marked B; the line D shews which
of the letters may be combined in a manner somewhat different.
Lest any one should be at a loss how to join two letters together, a plate has
been added, in which all the twenty-six letters of the alphabet are combined; those
who have learnt the Facilographic alphabet scarcely need be told, that to find the
combination of any two letters, it is only necessary to look for the first of the two
letters in the very first column on the left-hand side, and that under the other let
ter, at the head of the plate, and in the square space at the angle of meeting, will
be found the two letters joined: it may also be seen by the faint lines in the plate,
which letter is above and which below the line, or imaginary line for the writing.—
As some of the characters combine with equal propriety, two or three different
ways, the number of ways that any two characters might be joined together, is
pointed out by a small figure ; and the combination which is the most frequent, or
that which is effected with the greatest expedition is given in this plate; those
squares of the plate which are left blank, shew that the two characters correspond
ing to the angle of meeting, are never to be joined, because the same letters as ex
pressed by the other characters unite with greater neatness and dispatch. It may
not be amiss to remark, that in three of the Facilographic letters which have their
down-strokes carried below the line, viz. those for h, qu, and for 2, when any other
character is joined after them, the same manner of joining each with the succeed
ing character, is to be observed, as takes place in joining any of the short letters in
common writing, with any of the long down-stroke letters, viz. by making the pen
ascend again to the line upon the down-stroke itself, without lifting it from the pa
E. -
12
pcr; this will be clearly understood by every reader, only recollecting the manner
in which the last part of the letter p in common writing is joined to the strong
down-stroke or stem of that letter ; and what renders this still more obvious, is,
that the p, used in running-hand, exactly constitutes the three letters qua in Faci
lography; and similar contrasts might be pointed out in many other combinations
of the Facilographic letters.
Although most of the combinations occur in the examples contained in the
other plates, the learner would nevertheless find it of service to copy once or twice
the contents of Plate No. 8.
The learner is requested to make himself particularly perfect in the manner of
expressing the letter i in the combination with the other characters, the manner ex
hibited in Section No. 4, of Plate No. 1, of expressing i when it occurs both imme
diately before and after any other letter, by only drawing a short light stroke
through the letter, similar to the crossing of the t in common writing, will be found
well worth the attention of those who desire the most expeditious plan of writing,
for by this means the i is twice expressed by one single stroke of the pen, the expe
dition and great utility of this is shewn in Copy No. 1, of Plate No. 4, in the word
acquisition, and Copy No. 15, in the word acquiring, as the word is repeated after
the end of the copy. -
In reference to this second lesson, I would recommend that the examples be
copied several times, so that perfection be most completely attained in this before
the learner attempts the third lesson. -
The student is particularly recommended to express il, iv, and ip, in the
same manner as exemplified in the fourth section of the second lesson, in Plate No. I.
in whatever words they occur.

The second Section of this Lesson is intended to exemplify ss and s final, also
d and dal. - * -- . . .
The words mines, manes, morals and almonds, will shew the nature of the
words, and the manner in which final s may be expressed by a straight up-stroke.
The word oddness, as written a second time, is to show that it may be as well
expressed with the o made as a down-stroke, equally with the o as an up-stroke.
The way of expressing s joined with u in the word minus, virtuous, dangerous,
genius and usury, is very compact and elegant, being written in a very short com
pass. The pen when forming a curved line, has, as it were, a natural tendency to
complete a circle ; this I believe is the reason that the looped s is formed with so
much quickness and facility when either a or u, or w is the preceding letter.
The second Section of this lesson exemplifies s and ss, in several different ways,
and sufficiently proves the utility of having more than one manner of expressing s.
Note—That the up-stroke s would combine with facility with every, letter,
might easily be proved; observations on this subject will be found in Chapter X.
and may be seen by refering to the Table of Combinations contained in Plate No. 8.
By the examples here given of d and of dal, it will be seen, that the long top
to the d may be dispensed with, except in those cases where it is retained to ren
der the union of d with the succeeding letters easy and flowing, as in the example
of the word bondsman, and in many other instances, as may be seen in the plates.
The pupil should copy the examples in this lesson several times over, that they
may be well fixed in the memory.

PLATE No. III.
THIS Lesson consists of words in alphabetical order, the learner having at

the Facilographic characters the words contained in this lesson, and having copied
14
the words several times, till expert in writing them, may then proceed to the next
lesson. -
Note.—In earning the fourth Lesson, it is not intended that the pupil should
copy the articles contained under the head of “Miscellanies,” in Plate No. 3. Al
though many of the words are given in the fourth Lesson, they are again inserted in
the Miscellanies, in order to be more particularly treated of in another part of this

FIFTH LESSON.
-º
PLATE No. IV.
THIS Lesson consists of a set of copies in alphabetical order; the pupil is re
commended to write a page of each copy as given in the plate, beginning
with the copy No. I. and so proceed regularly on to No. 26: by observing this in
junction, the most rapid proficiency will be made; I could have given a greater
number of examples, such as remarkable speeches, and the letters of illustrious
personages, for the exercise of the learner; which might have been perhaps more
agreeable to the ideas of some persons, but this would have greatly added to the
number of the copper-plates, have much increased the price of the work, but
would not have promoted the proficiency of the learner in so short a time with so
much ease and certainty, as the method I have taken in treating the subject in a
progressive manner, in proceeding from letters to words, and from words to sen
tences.
The pupil is requested to bear in mind, that the greater part of the examples
contained in the plates are given in Facilography, considerably larger than the size
of Facilographic small-hand, but most particularly in plate No. 4, where the copies
are given in the round-text of Facilography; this has been done with a wish of ren
dering every thing as clear and plain as possible, so that every facility should be
afforded to the student in the acquisition of this new system, on most correct
principles: students are recommended to write the copies not more than half the

size of those given in plate No. 4, in the same plate, in the lines No.27 and 28, are
two of the copies repeated, viz. the Examples of the alphabet of copies No. 19
and 25, which is the size I most strongly recommend the student to write the whole
of the twenty-six copies, because, it is the small hand of Facilography, which
in this kind of writing is really equal in size to the small hand in common-writing,
by which will be seen, that whatever is written in Facilography, scarcely occupies
more space on the line, than about one-third the length that would be required,
were the same words written in the running-hand now in general use; and singular
as the assertion may appear, yet it is perfectly correct for to say, that any thing
written in full in Facilography, is with great ease comprised in as little space as if
done in the letter-press printing.

In order to shew the Application of Facilography to any Subject in Continuation,
the following piece of Poetry is given.
EMMA THE FAIR.
THE last time I visited Emma the Fair,
She did me receive with a prudish cold air,
Each denial she gave only heighten’d desire,
Each frown that she cast would fresh rapture inspire;
Her words fly like arrows whenever she speaks,
Quite matchless and charming the blush on her cheeks,
The form of her countenance truly divine,
Where the rose and the lily together combine, …
Her eyes bright as adamant pierced my heart,
I did unto her my fond anguish impart;
I implor’d her to marry, but that all in vain,
She said she had resolved a maid to remain ;
I then said dearest Lady unmarried you’ll stay,
So that your charms neglected will all fade away,
Enjoy every blessing of life in your prime,
Thus to balk me and Hymen, is lavishing time,
Over prudish wild notions for vanity food,
Which will make me unhappy and do you no good.
Now accept of the ring, grant to me your fair hand,
So no longer my generous offer withstand:

Refuse not my wishes, but kind hearted prove,
For ’tis heaven on earth to repay love with love.
NotE.—The punctuation to be used in Facilography, the same as in common
writing, only observing to place the points a little farther from the preceding words.
- SECTION, No. 2.
Application of Facilographic Characters to all Languages.
As the adaptation of alphabetic characters is optional, the application of the Fa
cilographic letters to all the European languages may easily be accomplished by only
considering the number of letters which constitute their respective alphabets; for,
supposing that any alphabet consists of more letters than our own, even in this case,
characters very simple in form, and well adapted for the purpose may be found in
the Miscellanies of Plate No. 5. As for instance, the Russian language which has
thirty-six letters, a character may be selected for each; and to represent those letters
which express simple sounds, or for the letters which occur most frequently, such of
the characters as are most simple in form should be taken, and for those letters
which occur the most seldom, or such as stand for complex sounds, take the cha
racters which are less simple in form ; by this means the whole of their alphabet will
be supplied by these characters, of which the least simple in form can be made with
so few as three moves of the pen, which number of inflections is required to make the
most simple letter in common-writing; and it generally happens that the languages
that have more letters than our own, is entirely owing to them having some of their
letters, whose vocal power in each, is compounded of two, three, and sometimes of
four simple sounds or letters.
Having shewn the application of these characters to languages which have
more, it only remains to shew how they may be applied to those languages which
have fewer letters than our own, as for instance, the Latin, French, the Italian, the
Spanish, and Portugueze languages, to do which, nothing more is necessary than to
select from the Facilographic alphabet just so many letters as the respective alphabet
consists of, omitting the rest of the characters.
NotE.-Although it cannot be expected that the students in Greek and He
brew will relinquish the custom of writing these languages in their respective cha
racters, they would nevertheless find the Facilographic characters much more expe.
ditious. * -

Remarks on Section III.

PLATE No. II.
HERE is repeated the Facilographic and running-hand alphabets, and under
every letter of both alphabets respectively, is placed a figure shewing the number
of moves or inflexions of the pen required to form each letter; some may be anxious
to know in what manner this is ascertained, for whose satisfaction I will explain how
this is effected; but as there is no necessity for doing this to every letter, therefore
I select one in which the inflexions of the pen are the more obvious; namely, the mof
running hand; to form this letter correctly, there is first a fine up-stroke; secondly,
a strong down-stroke; thirdly, another fine up-stroke; fourthly, a strong down
stroke; fifthly, fine up-stroke; sixthly, a strong down-stroke, and in the seventh
place to finish the letter there is another fine up-stroke, so that to form the m in
running-hand, no fewer than seven moves of the pen are required; but to form the
Facilographic m, needs no more than two moves of the pen; on these principles I
have ascertained the precise number of inflexions of the pen in the formation of the
different letters of the alphabet, and by referring to Plate No. 2, it will be seen
that to write the twenty-six letters of the running-hand alphabet, requires one hun
dred and twenty inflexions, and that the Facilographic alphabet is written with so
few as forty moves of the pen, which is no more than one third what is required for
the formation of the former, so that when any person shall have made himself per
fectly familiar with, and as competent in writing Facilography as what he is in com"
mon-writing, there cannot be any doubt but that he will write it three times as
quick. As a further elucidation in Plate No. 2, and of the same section, with a
sentence promiscuously taken, viz. “youth require admonition to avoid misfortune,”
I have contrasted this sentence as written in running-hand, and in Facilography, by
which it will be seen, that to write the word “admonition,” in common-hand, re
quires forty-two moves of the pen; but to write the same word with the Facilogra
phic characters, needs only eleven moves of the pen; I have placed the number of
19
inflexions of the pen under each word, by which it will be seen that some words
written in Facilography, do sometimes a little exceed one-third the nymber, and that
other words take not so much as one-third the number of inflexions that will be re
quisite to write them in running-hand: the sentence here spoken of requires one
hundred and fifty-one distinct motions of the pen to write the same in running-hand,
but is written in Facilography with only fifty moves of the pen.

Observations on the Miscellanies.
-º
PLATE No. III.
HAVING room to spare in this Plate I have accordingly inserted some ex
amples designed to elucidate certain particulars which could not with propriety be
treated ofuntil the learner had gone through the course of instruction given in the
six lessons. The words to which we would wish particularly to draw the attention,
are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c.
The word No. 1, exhibits a slight variation of writing the word opportunity;
the o in this word is written with a down-stroke brought back again on the upper
part of the up-stroke of the second p; this word in the example given in Lesson No.
4, is written with the o formed by the top part of the up-stroke of the second p, as it
also is in the other examples; either way is correct; but it will be found generally
both more expeditious and more elegant to write both o and e as up-strokes when an
easy and flowing junction with the succeeding letters will admit of this; the student
having diligently copied the examples contained in the six lessons, will know when
to do this with perfect ease and without any delay or premeditation.
No. 2, the word study, is written with the s made as a straight up-stroke in
clined toward the right, and this is a slight variation in the manner of writing the
same word compared with example No. 19, in Plate No. 4.
The word No. 3, is mankind, written with the short k, in the middle; this has
been spoken of in general observation on the letters, Chapter 3.
G
20
... No. 7, is the word abdominal, and is intended to shew the manner in which b
and d should be written when both meet together in the same word;—here we shall
just remark, that as the vowel o comes immediately after the d, the long top of the
d must be retained, which should be the case with all the other letters which may
come next after d, except only a, c, f, g, m, n and z, or character sh, but when ei
ther of these letters come after the d, the d is then only a little round loop which
is always distinguished by the turning given to the loop; it is obvious that in thus
writing the d with either of these seven letters, that we have the advantage of ex
pressing the d by one move of the pen, which produces a saving in each case of one
inflexion, because the first part of the next letter forms the last part of the d, this
saving of trouble will be very considerable where combinations of d with these let
ters take place some thousands of times, particularly when we consider that in
Facilography many of the letters are each of them made by a single stroke of the
pen. º -
In the line marked A, the word No. 8, is bundle—No. 9, genius—No. 10.judge
—No. 11, kushaiah—No. 12, running—No. 13, tun—No. 14, ten—No. 15, is south
ward, as a farther elucidation of Section 4th in Lesson No. 2. -
No. 23, is the word southward; the o, in this instance, is formed by the up
stroke of the s; this the inventor considered as the best way of expressing this and
similar words; for this word requires not so many moves of the pen by two, as the
same word next above it; the one acquiring eighteen, and the other only sixteen in
flexions of the pen.
No. 17, is the word transact, in which round-looped s is used—No. 16, is the
same word, with the up-stroke s, and the a made nearly twice its usual size—No.
18, the word unusual, with the round s—No. 19, is the same word, with the s made
as an up-stroke—No. 21, the word universality, in which s is an upstroke, and the
a nearly twice its usual size, in contrast to the example in Lesson No. 4.
No. 22, is the word passover, in which the first s is an up-stroke, and the o is
formed by the up-stroke of the second s. -
No. 24, is the word slander; this word is written to shew that although there
is a resemblance in the form of the s and of the l, yet there is not the least fear of s
being taken for the l, nor the l for the s, the one being invariably wrote above, and
the other below the line. -
No. 25, is the word munster, when u is the next letter after m; the u should
be joined with the m, as in the example. Or if the u be united with the m, so that
the u and m appear only as one character, in this case the u must be written in a
21
very small character, preserving a good round turning at the bottom of the u, and
the u to be written under the line, precisely as in the word munerary, example No.
32; and as in mussulman, example No. 33; and as in muskcherry, example No. 34.
The word No. 27, is tiresome; No. 28, figure; No. 29, nitre ; No. 30, mitre;
No. 31, impost. These five words elucidate in the clearest manner the method of
using the character for i, when represented by a dot or a comma, both before and
after any other letter, by which it will be seen, that when i comes before any of the
upright letters, the dot or comma must be placed close to the upright letter on the
left side; but if i comes after, place the dot or comma on the right-hand side; and
when i comes before any of the horizontal letters, viz. before c, f, m, n, u, and w,
the dot or comma is placed above them; but it is to be placed under them when the
i comes after them. To express ip il and iv, place the dot or comma over the cha
racters p for land v : to prevent the least possibility of misconception, these miscella
nies, and very ample remarks have been added, although the learner, who possesses
only a moderate portion of diligence, cannot but discern that they are practically
illustrated in the course of the examples. - -
No. 26, is the word widow; this example is to shew the manner of expressing
ow, in all similar words, by which it will be seen, that by making the first or left
hand side of the w, somewhat larger than usual, the o and w both become as legi
ble as though they were written as two separate characters. -
No. 12, is the word running; by this example it will be seen, that double n
in Facilography, is as distinct from the single n, as in common-writing, and in all
cases equally as legible. -
From the examples here given of the manner of writing s, it may be observed,
that in order to express the letter s before a or u by a single stroke of the pen up
wards, we have only to write the a or u nearly twice its usual size when coming im
mediately after the s, by so doing, the up-stroke s will become an universal cha
racter, which may be used in combination with all the letters with the most perfect
ease and legibility.
No. 20, is the word industry, in which the up-stroke s is used as a contrast to .
the same word in the Fourth Lesson. This word as written in example No. 20, is
done with so few as only nine moves of the pen; but the same word in running
hand could not possibly be wrote with fewer than thirty distinct motions of the pen;
thousands of other words would exhibit a contrast equally striking, and prove as
clearly, with what superior ease and expedition they can be written in Facilography
22
than in common writing ; but this, and several hundred other examples of words
given in this work, cannot fail of demonstrating the correctness of this assertion in
the most satisfactory manner.
The author now wishes to draw the attention of his readers, particularly to
the words No. 4, 5, and 6. No. 4, is the word monuments; in writing the o and the
e in this word, the pen is only moved so little above the horizontal line of the paper,
inclining a little to the right in making the o, and but bent a little to the left in
forming the e, as is just sufficient to indicate that it is not intended for mnumnts as
expressed in No. 5. The same thing may be observed in No. 6, the word commenda
tions; by which it will be seen, that to express on, when another letter comes be
fore the o, that it is only necessary to make the beginning or left end of the n a very
little bent, (towards the right-hand side) so that both letters will be formed by a sin
gle stroke of the pen, and nevertheless be as legible as though the o had been made
strictly according to the text given in the alphabet, that this assertion is perfectly
correct, any person may be fully convinced by comparing the word monuments, as
written No.4, with mnumnts, Example No. 5.
It may also further be observed, that in combination with the other letters, the
character for i will be quite legible if made only as a little strong dark spot; this
may be seen by the word imitated at the end of the line marked D. &c.
The pupil having gone through the six lessons, will readily discern, that in
plate No. 3, in the line marked E, is the example No. 1, and in the line D, is the
example No. 2, of Lesson No. 5, written after the same free and flowing manner as
the word monuments, No. 4, already spoken of
It is only just for to remark in this place, that although in the six lessons given
for the practice of the student, the author has closely adhered to the text of the
letters given in the alphabet; nevertheless as may be seen by the two ex
amples here spoken of, that after the correct principles of formation of the cha
racters are by practice well fixed in the mind, Facilography may be written with as
little of stiffness or formality, and with as much greater fluency, compared with the
style of the six lessons, as there is between the stiff formal manuscript of a boy
learning to write at school, and the easy and flowing style of a clerk, long practised,
to dispatch the business in a merchant's 'counting-house; and any person who shall
have diligently practised the examples and instructions contained in this work, will
be thereby enabled to write with much ease in Facilography, any subject whatever in
half the space and in one-third the time, that would be required to write the same

WITHIN a few years past, a mechanical principle has been applied to com
mon-writing, in order to acquire greater quickness and freedom in the execution of
epistolary and mercantile hands.
In order to embrace whatever may be of utility, this chapter is added to shew,
that a mechanical principle may with equal advantage be applied to Facilography.
*
PIATF No. 7.-SECT. No. 1.
IN the line No. 1, are several long straight horizontal lines drawn from the left
towards the right side of the paper; in the line No. 2, is the same, only the lines are
shorter than the former; the pupils will find it to their advantage to fill several sheets
of paper with these lines, each of which should be made by a single move of the
pen, and in as quick a manner as possible; this will render it extremely easy to
form the curved characters which require a kind of horizontal movement from the
left side to the right, viz. those in the lines Nos. 9, 10, and 11.
In the line No. 3, is a repetition of the diagonal up-stroke for the letters, first
practice the large size or those on the left side, and afterwards the smaller size given
in right-hand side of the copperplate; the same thing should be observed of all the
other examples given in this section of the plate.
In line No. 4, is a repetition of the diagonal s, united with a strong down
stroke for the letter i. -
In the line No. 5, is the combination of first a diagonal up-stroke, next is a
short strong down-stroke, nearly perpendicular, and thirdly, a short horizontal
line; which are three letters, viz. s, i, n, many times repeated from the beginning to
the end of this line; the frequent practice of this line will render easy all combina
tions on similar principles. -
No. 6, is the dipthong ee, several times repeated; the first e is made as an up
stroke, and the second e a down-stroke curved, and so in continuation to the end of
the line.
24
No. 7, is a repetition of the dipthong oo, the first o is an up-stroke, and the
second a down-stroke, and so in continuation to the end of the line. -
No. 8, consists of a fine up-stroke and a fine down-stroke, being a repetition of
the character for the letter t. ,
The line No. 9, is the character for c : 10 for w, and 11, for the letterj : in
these three lines respectively, each character is made by one curved stroke of the
pen, drawn in a quick manner from the left towards the right.
No. 12, is a repetition of the character for m, formed by a fine up-stroke, and
a strong down-stroke. -
No. 13, the letter a, many times repeated, which consists of, first a fine up
stroke, next a strong down-stroke, a little bent, and thickest in the middle, and
lastly, a fine up-stroke.
No. 14, consists of three letters joined together, namely, d, i, n, and several
times repeated: the frequent practice of this line will render the learner expert in
the formation of d, and also of its combinations with the other characters. The
frequent copying of the examples contained in this first section of this Plate, will
be found highly conducive to a rapid proficiency in Facilography.
SECTION No. 2.
An expeditious Method of expressing all kinds of Mumbers.
Many persons have remarked, how desirable it would be that figures to
express numbers should be such as would unite without lifting the pen from
the paper: the Facilographic letters which are adapted to express numbers, if
expressed separately, and the pen lifted to write each character, even in this case
they will express any numbers in less than half the time that is required for the fi
gures in common use; but the series of characters given in Plate No. 7, which are
to be applied to all numbers consisting of two figures, or which are above ten, will
all unite without removing the pen from the paper, and then are written in nearly
one-third the time for the Arabic numerals.
It should be observed, that precisely the same method of writing these Facilo
graphic numerals, as is observed in writing words in Facilography, and this will be
perfectly easy to the student who has attained perfection in the six foregoing les
sons, and they will be equally legible as if written separately.
Those who prefer expressing all the figures separate, both in small and in great
numbers, may use the series of characters given for numbers under ten ; to distin
25
guish numbers expressed by the Facilographic letters, nothing more is required than
to place a short dash of the pen or straight line over them. Fractions have a line
between the numerator and denominator, as in the usual manner, but the author
flatters himself, that the examples he has given in Plate No. 7, will render the use
of Facilographic numerals quite easy and obvious.
SECTION No. 4.
On preserving Distinctness.
AS there is a ehoice and discretion in the way of using some of the Facilogra
phic characters as applied to represent the same letters; the following remarks if
duly observed, will enable the student in all cases, to preserve the greatest possible
degree of distinctness, and consequent legibility.
1. The character for e, when made as a down-stroke, should always be broad
and strong at the top part, but taper fine towards the lower part ; the same charac
ter, when formed by an upward motion of the pen should be more strong than what
are called hair strokes, used only to connect letters; in both cases, the character for
e should be made curved in a sufficient degree, to prevent the possibility of its being
taken for a straight line.
2. The character for o, made as a down-stroke, should always be fine in the
upper part, but considerably stronger at the lower part thereof: made as an up
stroke, it should be more strong than if it was intended as a stroke only used to
connect letters with ; in either case, the character for o, should be sufficiently curved
to be easily distinguished from a straight line.
3. Whenever the b, the long k, the p, u, v, or the character for ph, come next,
after the letter m, and are joined to the m, the character for m, as given in line No.
2, of the alphabet, in Plate No. 1, should always be used; and in forming the cha
racter for l, the down-stroke should be quite straight, and the loop formed by the
up-stroke, should be very narrow.
4. The character for t, given in the alphabet, in line No. 2, is preferable for
its distinctness to the character for t, in line No. 3. And the looped characters
for r, preferable in the same respects to the horizontal character for r.
5. The character for the should never be used in any word as part thereof, ex
cept in the very beginning, should the fancy of the student incline to use it in the
composition of such words as theology, thereafter, therein, &c. &c.
6. The round looped s, should be joined as near as possible, both to the cha
26
racter which comes immediately before it, and to the character which comes next
after it; this will prevent the possibility of its assuming the appearance of a c com
ing before or after it, when it is not intended that c should be so expressed.
Note.—These remarks on preserving distinctness, are to be understood as ap
plying equally to the Facilographic characters, whether used to write words in full,
or when applied to a system of short-hand.
SECTION No. 5.
On increasing Expedition.
AS was briefly remarked in the conclusion of the third Chapter, that words
may be written in one-third the usual time, by the twenty-six letters of the Facilo
graphic alphabet, &c. I shall here speak more particularly how dispatch may be
increased by the use of the supernumerary characters for, and, et cetera, the, for,
ph, qh, sh, th, wh, ch, and pl.
1. The character for sh may be used to most advantage when the following
characters come next after, viz. the character, for c, f, b, n, p, v, w, y, ph, ch, wh,
th, and long w and long k; the character for sh, admits any of these characters to be
joined to it in manner the most easy and flowing that could be desired.
2. Although I used the character for qu, which is given in line No. 3, of the
alphabet, in the first Facilographic alphabet, which I invented, at present it is sel
dom used by me, except in such words in which n immediately precedes q, as in the
words enquire, inquest, &c. because the other character for qu, in line No. 2, is
formed by one stroke of the pen, and when in combination with other characters, is
always perfectly distinct and legible.
3. To write the word the correctly, in common writing, takes ten moves of
the pen, but the Facilographic character for this same word, only requires two mo
tions of the pen.
4. The character for th, can be used to greater advantage in the beginning of
words, looks very neat, and is written with so little trouble, as the t; the charac
ters for ph, pl. gh, and sh, will be found still more expeditious than the same let
ters of the Facilographic alphabet, and producing, at the same time, a great degree
of elegance in the writing; the way of expressing whº and ch, as exemplified in
Plate No. 6, is most strongly recommended to those who desire the utmost dis
patch, as for example the word what, and the word which, the first of these words
in common writing takes about nineteen movements of the pen, and the latter word
27
twenty, or twenty-one motions; but thus expressed in Facilography, the word what,
takes only four, and the word which, no more than three motions of the pen!
5. In any words where l immediately follows k, as in the word buckle, &c.
the short k should be used, so that the same movement of the pen which forms the
k, will also form the down-stroke of the l; many of the combinations of the Faci
lographic letters, will be found to promote expedition on a similar principle, which
the diligent student will readily discern, and of which he will, no doubt, avail
himself.
SECTION No. 5.
Occasional Remarks.
\
AS a diversity ofopinion prevails even among connoisseurs in expeditious writ
ing, concerning the use of characters which are written disjunctively, or separated
from the words to which they belong; a few remarks on this subject may be intro
duced in this place with some degree of propriety.
Some authors on Stenography, have employed one and the same kind of cha
racter to represent two, three, four, and even five different sounds or letters; the
letter intended to be expressed by such character in their schemes, can only be known
by considering the relative position which that bears to the other characters; such
way of expressing of letters is very objectionable for the following reasons:—first,
that although we can place a character which is written disjunctively in any relative
position with another, that is also written unconnected with any other letter; yet
we shall find in many instances, that we shall not be able to do the same, when se
veral characters are joined together.
Secondly, That when a character is written separately, and is only to be known
by the position it bears to the other characters, great care must be taken in making
such character precisely in its proper place, otherwise, it will be liable to be mis
taken for some letter which it is not intended for:—thirdly, That since great care is
required in placing such characters in their proper position, it therefore follows as
a natural consequence, that some other character, though not so simple in its form,
and which would combine with the rest of the characters, may be written full as
expeditiously, and will be found to possess a much greater portion of uniformity
and legibility.
I have given characters for three of the vowels, viz, a, i, and u, which can be
written disjunctively, but in whatever position these three characters are placed,
- I
28
they always represent the same letters, therefore the legibility of the writing is not
lessened by the use of them; but, even independent of the use of these three cha
racters, and by those only which are contained in line No. 2 of the alphabet, every
word can be written without removing the pen from the paper, from the beginning to
the end of each word; the i written as a dot, is the only character which I would
recommend to be used in writing words in full by the Facilographic letters, it can
be used without injuring legibility for the reason just before mentioned, from which,
and its easy formation, I have found by experiment, that the use of it conduces to
greater expedition.

AN
A P P E N D I X,
SHEWING THAT THE
C H A R A C T E R S
USED IN
FA C I LOG R A PHY,
are applied so as to constitute an excellent System of
SHORT-HAND,
With clear and concise Ruins, accompanied by proper Examples to each, ia
PROSE;
and then the whole is recapitulated in
VERSE.
From the well-known Fact, that whatever is presented to the Mind in the form
of Poºray, can with much ease be remembered for a long time;
with several other Novelties of real utility,
never before made public.
TO THE READE R.
=
Those who have learned Facilography, will, no doubt, be gratified to see
with what ease it is converted into Stenography; as they will already have learned
the characters, and have become expert in the formation of them, and it may be
seen by inspection, that the letters used in Facilography, are as simple in form,
and as easily made, as the characters for the alphabet given in the Systems of Short
hand, which have hitherto appeared before the Public, as was before observed
in the Preface. Those who have learned Short-hand are well aware, that instead of
the writing being preserved on a straight line (in the manner that running-hand is)
that the letters are frequently joined one into another, from the top of the line, and
then carried underneath the line, one under the other, and sometimes they are car
ried upwards one above the other for three, four, or five letters together; sometimes
the letters are formed and joined together by bringing the pen in a direction from
the right-hand towards the left, which is quite contrary to the natural movement ofthe
pen; these it must be acknowledged, are found very serious impediments to persons
learning Short-hand; but in this System, which I now lay before my readers, all these
objections are obviated, the writing is in straight lines, and the motion of the pen is
uniformly from the left towards the right-hand, as in common writing, and this will
be found a practice to contribute very considerably to promote dispatch, and render
the writing much more clear and legible. * *
I shall now proceed to give such rules and directions, as render this System
applicable to every purpose for which Stenography is required.
One thing I shall briefly notice is, that as I could see no utility in substituting
k in lieu of c, when c sounds hard, nor of supplying its place with s when sounded
soft, because not even one single stroke of the pen could be saved, nor any greater
expedition gained by so doing, therefore in this System, c is used wherever it oc
curs in common-writing; where expedition is increased by such substitutions, it is
all very well, as in substituting f for gh and ph, when they sound like f because in
each of these instances the trouble of expressing a letter is saved; the characters
given for gh and ph, as given in the Facilography, with an expert penman, will be
found sufficiently expeditious for short-hand, but those who wish, as far as they can
to deviate from the principles of correct orthography, are as much at liberty to do
so in this new system as by any other.

CHAPTER I.
º -º
SECTION I.
-º
PLATE No. 9.
IN this, as in other Systems of Stenography, the letters of the alphabet and
other characters, will each serve to represent some word, or words, such as occur
most frequently, with this advantage, that as we have here the vowels, consequently
a greater number of words can be represented by my alphabet than by theirs.
Note. In every case where the using of a single letter to represent a word
would be any way liable to make the reading of what is written in any respect
ambiguous, more than a single letter should be used; but in this, the experience
and discretion of the student will be a better guidance than any rules that can be
written. -
N. B. The Facilographic character for h whenever it is used to represent sh,
should be at least one half longer than when it is only used for h, see the Plate.
f SECTION No. II.
Rules and Eramples.
Rule 1.-Correct spelling is not to be attended to, and no more letters should
ever be used than what will serve to convey the sound.
Rule 2.--Where double letters meet in any word, only one of them should be
used, as in the word command, one m only is to be retained, and would be thus
written cmnd, Ex. No. 1, pl. 6; or as in the word giddy, only one d is to be used,
and thus written, gdy, Ex. No.2, pl. 6. -
Note. By those who are desirous of being very concise, the personal termi
nations of verbs may be omitted, as in lovest, lovedst, loveth and loves, might
always be omitted; and the ed and ing of participles may be often omitted, and most
K
32
terminations after a conjunction; adverbs formed from adjectives, may drop their
ly; substantives their 3y, ty, and itsy ; and verbs their ize: as modest,-ly, ty;
honest,-ly-ty; temporal-ly-ity; moral-ly, itv.-ize, &c. Also ance, ence, ancy;
ency, ant, ent, antly, ently, may be omitted if the preceding part be a complete
word, and of the same signification; as confide, ence, ently. Whole words may
frequently be omitted without injuring legibility, as the articles a, an, the, the
preposition of and than, after comparitives, &c.
Rule 3.-The character for c, made twice its usual size, will represent ch, or
chr, in any part of the word; but when it is made its usual size, will serve with
advantage in the beginning of words for the prepositions circum, com, and con.
h, In like manner, made in a character one half larger than its usual length,
will well represent sh, but when made its usual size, it will stand for th, whether
in the beginning, the middle or end of any word; but as a character isgiven in the
first lesson of Facilography for sh, the student can use either, for the use of both is
shewn in the examples. * *
- Rule 4.—h Must never be retained in the beginning of words, as the word
honour, the h has no sound, and is therefore rejected, and the following vowel writ
ten in a very small character, will better convey the sound in honour, thus, onr,
Ex. No 3. PI.6; the same shouldbe understood of any of the vowels when hpre
cedes them in the beginning of words. º -
Rule 5–The vowels should be omitted, except as mentioned in the fourth Rule;
or when used as dipthongs, or as prepositions, which cases are explained under their
respective rules. See the Rules No. 6, 7, and 17. * -
Rule 6.--Dipthongs, or double vowels, in any word may be clearly understood
by writing only one of the vowels; for a dipthong beginning a word, the vowel
when expressed in any other parts of words its usual size, or such a size as may
best suit with its combination with the other letters, as in the word oar, written or,
Ex. No. 4, Pl. 6. . . t . . . . . . . .
Rule 7.---The vowels e and o, in many cases can be written without any addi
tional trouble; when this is the case, they may be expressed, as in the word mere
tricious, the e may be introduced between the r and the t, by only making the
up-stroke of the t a little curved, this will assist the sound, and the word will ap
pear thus mretre, to which must be added, the termination for ious. Ex. No. 6,
Pl. 6. In the word notorious o is in like manner introduced, between n and t.
33
-->
Ex. No.7. Pl. 6, and as e is introduced between r and m in the word remem
brance, Ex. No. 9, Pl. No. 6..." is
Rule 8.—When any consonant not being of the same kind of letter as the first
consonant of word (as expressed in Short Hand) occurs twice in the same word, by
Rule 2nd...one consonant only should be written, but if a dipthong or a vowel come
between the like two consonants, both consonants should be written, or one of them
made nearly twice its proper size will serve.
Example.—As in the word remembrance, here the vowel e comes between the
two m's, and would be expressed rmmb, with the termination for rance, Ex. No. 8,
Pl. 6; or rmb as in Ex. No. 9, Pl. 6. * - * - 3
Rule 9.--When a consonant begins any word, and there is a similar consonant
in the middle of the same word, (a dipthong or a vowel between them) in this case
both consonants should be written, as in the word momentous, written mmnts,
expressed mmnt with the termination ous added thereto, Ex. No. 10, Pl. 6.
. . . Note. Dyssyllables may by this system, frequently be written with two
letters only for a word, as the word moment would be written, m with the termi
nation for ment. - * : * .
Rule 10.-If a vowel come between the first and second consonant; the first
consonant should be no more than half its proper size.
As in the word command, o comes between the c and the m, and should be
expressed, as in Ex. No. 1, Pl. 6; or as in meritorious, Ex. No. 6, Pl. 6.
Rule 11.—If a vowel comes before the first consonant, the first consonant must
be written its usual and proper size. As in the word additional expressed dshn!
that is d with the long h as the character for sh and n! joined together, Ex. No. 12,
Pi. 6. -
Rule 12–The pen should not be taken off the paper, while writing any word,
except to express the disjoined terminations, and even then but a very little distance
from the rest of the word. º - * *
Rule 13–G and h meeting together when sounded like fare not to be written;
f must supply their place, as in the word laughing, it should be written (fng or,lſ.
and the termination ing thereunto added, Ex. No. 14, Pl. 6. -
Rule 14.-Ph when together sound like f: f must be used instead of them, as
in philosopher written fisfr, Ex. No. 14, or with the prepositional f for the fl,
Ex. No. 15, Pl. 6. -
Rule 15–S, when this letter is used as a termination to any word, it may be
well expressed by a fine hair stroke made very straight, by carrying the pen upwards
34
in a diagonal manner; the same as the terminational s used in Facilography, as in
the word preserve written prs, or with p as preposition for pr; and the termination
for serve. Ex. No. 16, Pl. 6. - -
Rule 16–In conformity with Rule 1st. b and to may be omitted in many
words, and this without injuring either the sense or the sound, as in the word
plumber, written plmr, or write the prepositional p, for pl to which join mr, see
Ex, No. 17, Plate 6, or Ex. No. 18, or as in the word fellow, written flo, Ex. No.
19, Pl. 6, or with the prepositional f for fl, Ex. No. 20, Pl. 6, or as in the word
answering written nsr with the termination for ing added thereto, and may be
expressed, as in Example 21st. or Example 22nd. Plate 6, either using the up-stroke
s or the other s, as suits the inclination of the writer. D may also be omitted in
many words, as in bondman may be written, bmmn, &c.
Rule 17-THE PRErositions. The vowels used as prepositions must be their
usual and proper size.
By making the consonants one half larger than they are usually made, in pro
portion to the rest of the writing, they will serve to express the double letters and
prepositions contained in the following table.

SECTION III.
THE RULES IN VERSE.
- —sº
The metre being varied in the following Poetry, was done with a view of preventing any part of one rule being
taken as part of another, and as having a tendency to render the whole more impressive on the memory.
RULE I.
Those who in Short Hand would succecd,
Of spelling words correctly must not heed,
As needless letters in our words abound,
Use only such as will convey the sound.
RULE II.
When in a word two letters of one kind,
If spelt correctly would be both combined,
But in swift writing with much ease we may,
By one of them the sound and sense convey,
That you this rule may clearly understand,
We find the m twice in the word command,
Which in short writing thus express'd would be,
In proper characters c m n d.
RULE III.
Ch, or chr by letter c
Made twice its usual size express'd may be,
C made its usual size, then if you please,
Will com, or con, or circum shew with ease ;
As h beginning words does never sound,
As a first letter let it not be found,
Made one half larger for sh we know,
But h its usual size th will shew. *
RULE IV.
When h does not sound by the third rule you see,
In beginning of words it omitted must be ;
But instead of h write the vowel succeeding,
A letter quite small, 'twill make easy the reading.
L
36
RULE W.
Omit the vowels when you swiftly write,
And this will much the labour expedite,
Except when they for prepositions stand,
And then they are retained in this Short Hand.
RULE VI.
And when they're used dipthongs to express,
The vowels then are made full one half less,
Beginning words, this only is the case,
But their just size in any other place:
One vowel for each dipthong then write down,
Sufficient quite to make the sense be known,
Since in most cases, ('tis well known to you,)
One vowel's only sounded of the two.
RULE VII.
In many cases o and e,
Without more trouble wrote may be, :
As when we form the upstroke of the t,
And as we curve the upstroke left or right,
The o or e presents itself to sight.
RULE VIII.
Two consonants not the same kind,
As the one we first in the word wrote,
When both consonants are combined,
*Twill a vowel between them denote,
Or if you would be more concise,
And your writing still shorter to bring,
One consonant near twice the size,
Will precisely denote the same thing.
RULE IX.
When with any consonant a word shall begin,
A like consonant follow (a vowel between,)
Both the consonants you in this case should express,
Not forgetting that you make the first one half less.
37
—e
RULE X.
In any word as written in Short Hand,
"Twill be of service for to understand,
Whether a vowel should be understood,
The consonant first written to precede,
Or when between the two consonants we should,
Although not written there a vowel read,
For when the first consonant is made one half less,
That a vowel comes after it then will express.
RULE XI.
When ever the first consonant is its just size,
That a vowel precedes it then aptly implies
RULE XII.
The pen from the paper ne'er lift,
Until the whole word you have pen'd,
Nor only a small distance shift,
To write th’ terminations at the end.
RULE XIII.
When g and h like f do sound,
Let f supply their place.
RULE XIV.
Ph when they're together found,
Use fin either case.
RULE XV.
A straight fine up-stroke always serves for s,
When used a termination to express.
RULE XVI.
Whenever b and w do’nt sound,
Omit them in such words as they are found.
RULE XVII.
THE PREPOSITIO.W.S.
As you desire what will to speed conduce,
You'll find the prepositions of great use,
i
38 - - - - - - -
That uncouth rhymes may useful prove you'll grant,
Therefore let a stand for abs, adv, or ant,
E stand for end, ent, entr, or enter,
And i for ind, int, intr, we prefer,
O may also stand for out or over,
Under or uni we by u diseover ;
As prepositions used (to be concise)
The vowel must retain their proper size,
But with the consonants 'tis otherwise,
Bl or brwe must show by b,
Ch and chr by letter c -
Made twice its usual size, (expressed may be)
C made its usual size, then if you please,
Will com, or con, or circum shew with ease,
D for dr or dis will serve as well,
F likewise will express.fr, f : * . . . . . .
And g will always shew gr, gl, -
As h beginning words does never sound, ,
As a first letter let it not be found,
Made one half longer for sh we know,
But hits usual size th will shew, t
J thus may stand for jea, jeer, just, or jes,
K, kl, kr.—L, lan, or lat express;
M stands for mis, mag, magni, or multi,
And n will also nat or non imply:
P, pl. pr;-q, for quie, quer, quar,
Recom, recon are both expressed by r,
S, stand for satis, sub, or for super, -
By t, tr, tran, trans we may infer; -
Val, ver and ves by v are made appear,
W shows wh or where ;
X doth ea, eacam, eacem, avow,
Y, yon, yes, yester, zeal by z we shew.
Thus you see what each consonant implies, .
Wrote one half larger thanits usual size.

UBLIC LIR£º
CHAPTER II.
SECTION I.
-º
* Rule 1.-In following a rapid speaker, a great number of words, as the articles
the, a, or an: prepositions and sometimes pronouns may be omitted, and yet the
whole substance of the discourse be taken down: these omissions may be supplied
, afterwards, when the writer has leisure.
Rule 2.-All the punctuation required in Short-Writing, is to leave more blank
space wherever a pause occurs, than what is left between any two words in other
parts of the sentence. ! -
And when a discourse or any part thereof is put in form of a question, the note
of interrogation should be added. s" -
Rule 3.-In reading what is written in Short-Hand, every consonant should be
sounded full and strongly; this will suggest to the reader what vowels were omitted,
and greatly assist in deciphering what is written. -
Rule 4.—Draw a line under such words or sentences as are repeated.
. . If a sentence which has already been written, be again repeated in any other
# part of the discourse, write the two first words of such sentence, to which add the
character for et cetera. - -
Rule 5.--When numbers are to be expressed, the Facilographic Figures should
be used; and will be found the most expeditious, and better adapted for the
purpose than any other characters. * -
Rule 6–TERMINATIons,—The terminations of words should be written but a
very small distance from the other part of the word, disjoined and only so little
distance above the line, (on which the rest of the word is written) as will serve to
distinguish them:
Except the characters for h, l, q, and y, which should retain their usual places,
the same as Facilography.
M
40
:
By the intimate connexion of words with one another, and of the terminations
with the preceding parts of words, the twenty six letters with much facility will
express the following, which are the principal, and nearly the whole of the termina
tions in the English language.

SECTION II.
THE RULES IN VERSE.
-E-m
RULE I.
In following a rapid speaker
Many omissions may be made,
And his discourse be not made weaker,
But all the substance be conveyed.
The articles and prepositions may be
Very often omitted without injury,
And these omissions when the writer has leisure
May all be inserted with much ease and pleasure.
RULE II.
We need no other punctuation
When we’re writing of Short-hand,
Between two words more space than usual
Aptly for a pause will stand.
When we put in form of question
Any part of an oration
Indicating this suggestion,
Add the note interrogation.
RULE III. -
Sound each consonant strong, you may then understand,
With muchgreater ease what you wrote in Short-hand;
This will greatly assist to suggest to the mind,
Both the vowels omitted, and what is their kind.
RULE IV.
When a word should be repeated
Underneath it draw a line,
And a sentence once completed
We with equal ease define,
44
and is used to represent th, agreeably to Rule No. 3, of the first chapter of this
appendix, and in contrast to the long h used in writing the word additional, (Ex.
No. 12.) by which may be seen that h will serve to express both thand sh, without
the least fear of one being taken for the other. The examples in this Plate also
Prove that when any letter shall be used as a preposition by being made in a larger
character than usual, it is so distinct that it cannot be mistaken for the same letter
when not intended to represent a preposition, as may be seen by the word pleased,
which is written twice over, first without and in the second place (Ex. No. 29) with the
preposition, as in the whole of the words which are written twice in this Plate; they
also demonstrate the utility of both the prepositions and terminations as here used; by
which words may be written in the most concise manner that is possible, and yet be
as legible by this system as by any other whatever.
The miscellanies are obvious, and we have only to remark, that the character for
sdr, or for str, may be used with advantage as the same cannot be mistaken, there
being no combination of the Facilographic characters that will resemble it; the same
observation applies to the character given for thr, and that for rth, &c.
No.59 is the word church, written with c twice its usual size for the preposition
chr, and with c its proper size, as the termination ch ; so that these two characters
agreeably to the rule do fully express chrch; the same is further elucidated in the
word churchman, No. 60, where it should be observed that as the second c is not a
termination it is therefore made twice its usual size, by the third Rule, Chapter first;
Nos. 61, 62, 63,64, and 65, serve as examples of the utility of c used as a prepostion.
The word No. 64, charity is expressed with the prepositional c for chr, and y
for itsy agreably to the Rule for terminations; the word charitable, No. 65, in like
manner expresses chrt, to which is added b as the termination for able.
The easy legibility and extreme conciseness of the whole of the examples cannot
but be quite obvious to every person who has learned the rules in this treatise.
PLATE No. 7.
J1 Letter against Waste of Time.
Converse often with yourself, and neither lavish your time, nor suffer others to
rob you of it; many of our hours are stolen from us, and others pass insensibly
away; but of both these losses, the most shameful is that which happens through our
own neglect. Hºwe take the trouble to observe, we shall find that one considerable
part of our time is spent in doing evil, and the other in doing nothing, or in doing
45
what we should not do. We don't seem to know the value of time, nor how precious
a day is, nor do we consider that every moment brings us nearer to our end, Re
flect upon this, I intreat you, and keep a strict account of time. Procrastination is
the most dangerous thing in life. Nothing is properly ours, but the instant we breath
in, and all the rest is nothing; it is the only good we possess; but then it is fleeting,
and the first comer robs us of it. Men are so weak that they think they oblige by
giving trifles, and yet reckon that time as nothing, for which the most grateful
person in the world can never make amends. Let us therefore consider time as the
most valuable of all things, and every moment spent without some improvement in
virtue, or some advancement in goodness, as the greatest sublunary loss.
The Lord's Prayer.
Our Father which art in heaven; hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;
thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven: give us this day our daily bread, and
forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil: Amen.
Dr. Mavor in his system of Stenography has written the Lord's Prayer with
about 123 distinct characters; it is here written with 80, the difference is 43.
The letter against waste of time is also one of Dr. Mavor's examples, he uses
about 525 distinct characters, it is here written with 401, the difference is
124.
That this is as equally legible as Dr. Mavors will be perfectly evident to every
one who has learned Facilography and the rules in this Appendix.
I shall here remind the reader that not even a single word is omitted in these
two specimens of Facilographic Short-Hand, and moreover I have not made use of
arbitrary symbols instead of words, they are nevertheless more concise than by some
systems which make use of symbols, &c. - *
The Lord's Prayer as written in Plate No. 7, requires 115 motions of the pen,
and the letter against waste of time, takes 564, total 679 motions of the pen; to
read these two pieces with propriety requires three minutes time; now it is well
known that an ordinary penman can make from 280 to about 350 movements of the
pen in one minute; but if he be competent in Short-Hand, as mentioned in the
concluding part of second Section of 3rd Chapter of this Appendix, he will not
need to make more than from 226 to about 230 motions of the pen in a minute, to
enable him to follow a speaker. -
46
Agreeably to the note on increasing expedition, in the 1st. Section of 3rd.
Chapter of this Appendix, I can write the Lord's Prayer with 84 movements of the
pen, and the letter against waste of time with 455, total 539 motions of the pen,
by which no more than about 180 movements of the pen, would be required per
minute to follow a rapid speaker. -
CHAPTER III.
. . . SECTION I.
---
On increasing Expedition.
Having given some directions on this subject in the Facilography, I shall here as
respects the Stenography be very concise; when t is expressed singly, the t contain
ed in line No. 2 of the alphabet, is sooner made than the horizontal t in line No. 3;
but when you have occasion to express tr, the two horizontal characters for these
two letters will be more quickly made than the upright characters for the same; the
character for th, when joined with horizontal r is full as soon made as the r can be
when written alone; the character for the used in Facilography may also be applied
to Stenography with advantage, and will improve the legibility of what is written;
it may also be advantageously used as the first part of any word, beginning or
having the sound of the in the first syllable; the character for m given in the alpha
bet in line No. 3, may be used in Short-hand, when distinctness will not be lessened
by its use, agreeably to what has already been said in the Postscript to the Facilo
graphy, the g contained in line No. 3 of the alphabet, should always be used when
ever g is expressed singly, or when it is used as a termination. The a given in the
same line of the alphabet should always be used as a termination, &c.
In many instances expedition may be increased without injuring the legibility,
by expressing only the first syllable, or the first letter of words, when the context
will point out the signification, as in the following sentence, “he was reading the
Parliamentary debates at the time we saw him in the Coffee House,” in long hand
would be sufficiently legible if written thus, he was read the Parl deb at t we saw
47
him in the coffee h, and to those well versed in Short-hand would be equally clear
if only expressed in the characters for the following letters, h, w, rd, t, prl, db,
a, t, win, w, sw, h, n, t, kff, h.
Note. As vowels never need be used in following a speaker, (except when
used for prepositions and terminations,) those who desire to increase expedition
still more, may supply the place of l with that of the character for the Facilogra
phic o and the r, with that of the character for e, and t by a short strong
down-stroke made quite perpendicular; the character called long i may supply the
place of d, and when dal occurs in any word, make the same character twice its
usual length; the character for c may supply the q; s will serve both for s and for
z; the character for f may also supply the place of both f and v.; the long w may
serve for p, and the Facilographic p for pl; the land r of Facilography will serve, the
l for sh, and the upright r for thr; c when sounded hard, may be supplied by k,
when sounded soft by s; the character called long k will serve for sdr, or for str,
and a may be supplied by the character given in Section II. of Plate No. 9. The
characters to be joined precisely in the same manner as in Facilography; by this
means the whole of the consonants which occur most frequently will consist
of Facilographic characters as expeditious as possible, preserving the most perfect
lineality; in which case the vowels whenever they are used, must be written disjunc
tively, with the characters for given them in Plate No. 9, Section II.
SECTION II.
Remarks on Following a Speaker.
Some authors have asserted that their respective systems would enable persons
of the meanest capacity, and such as can scarely write their names in common wri
ting, by a few hours practice to follow the most rapid speaker; the absurdity of such
assertions must be obvious to every thinking mind; I have no hesitation in declar
ing that however excellent any system of Short-hand may be, that even the best
capacities and the most expert penmen could not attain to any such perfection by
only a few hours practice; some weeks if not even some months of diligent study
and application, are in general indispensibly requisite, even for them to become
every way competent to follow rapid Speakers; the achme of perfection in any art
or science can never be attained in a few hours only; what then must become of the
O
• 48
proficiency made in a few hours by mean capacities and bad penmen? It would in
deed be true to say, that a knowledge of all the essentials ofShort-liand may be acqui
red in a few hours; but to attain perfection in their application, must, most assuredly,
be a work of some considerable time and diligence. Added to which, the writer
must not only be an expert penman, but must also be quite free from nervous affec
tions, be perfectly composed in himself, possess a considerable portion of assurance,
so as never to be the least embarrassed by being in the presence ofany company, how
ever numerous; his attention must be ever on the alert, and his hearing very good; he
must not only be thoroughly acquainted with the theory of the abbreviating rules, the
prepositions and terminations, but must be perfectly expert in their practical appli
cation in every word which can possibly occur, these qualifications combined are
absolutely requisite in order to follow a rapid speaker.
Before I conclude this Section of my remarks, I take this opportunity of once
more recommending in the strongest terms, that all persons learning Short-hand,
should spare no pains in attaining perfection in the use of the prepositions and ter
minations, the utility of which they may rest perfectly assured will amptly com
pensate for the trouble bestowed in acquiring them.

JMiscellaneous Hints and Observations.
I shall now lay before my reader a method by which any person may soon ac
quire a habit of writing words in a very concise manner, which will very much
familiarize the mind to the principles of writing Short-hand; which is to take a
Dictionary, or even a common Spelling Book will do as well, in which the words are
arranged in alphabetical order; begin with those consisting of two syllables, write
them down in rotation, word by word, stripping them of the vowels, writing only
the consonants in the Facilographic characters. Write them also with the preposi
tions and terminations, which will render the words as concise as possible. This
instruction, if the student will practice it, will be found to answer the purpose
much better than to copy speeches and essays, as is commonly done, as soon the Pupil
has learned the alphabet; but by thus first applying it to words, will render its ap
plication to every other purpose more easy, certain and pleasant than could
49

have been imagined; Speeches, Letters and Essays may then be attempted with
much pleasure and advantage; and more real proficiency will be made in less time
than by any other method. Many on perusing this may be ready to say, that it is
somewhat singular that a method so very easy, had not before been made known
to them; I believe that it may be with confidence asserted, that it has never before
been made public, and that this mode of rendering of Short-hand a very easy acqui
sition, is entirely my own; for no person ever communicated it to me, and I never
met with any thing similar in any treatise on Stenography, although I have perused
all the treatises which are considered as works of merit in this department ofliterature.
Another thing which will be found amply to repay the trouble, is to have the
paper previously ruled with lines the fourth or fifth of an inch apart. º -
Pale blue ink will do best for this purpose, this will not only give the writing a
neat and uniform appearance, but will also insure a regular number of lines of wri
ting, and moreover will be found so very useful in reference to the manner of writing
the terminations.
In order that every thing might be elucidated as clearly as possible, all such
words as admit of being expressed more ways than one in this system of Short-hand,
are accordingly written two or three different ways, as the word command, Inay
either be written cmnd, or kmnd, &c. as may be seen in Plate No. 6. /
In one or two instances a few lines of the same words are repeated, as the re
marks on the letter h, contained in the latter part of Rule No. 3, of Chapter I. in
Poetry, will also be found in the Rule for the prepositions in verse, because in reality
the same words constitute part of two rules, which are entirely distinct and inde
pendent of each other.
The following Rules in Poetry, viz. 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, of-
the first Chapter, and Rules No. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, of the Second, are of the most im
portance to be committed to memory. -
To prevent any possibility of mistake, the prepositions spoken of in Rule No.
1, Chapter II. are the words to, of, by, for, in, &c. though it would be improper
to omit them in common writing, yet they may be omitted in Short-hand whenever
the context will point them out, as in this sentence; “he was a Prince of the House
of Lancaster,” this would be sufficiently clear in Short-hand if written, “He was
Prince House Lancaster”; the inseparable prepositions, contained in the table of
Chapter I. to be used for the beginnings of words, must never be omitted.
Those who would wish to be particular in punctuation, after the writing is
finished may conveniently write them in red ink.

* - For writing Short-hand the ink should be blackest and clearest that can be
procured, that every letter may appear distinct the instant it is formed; the pen
should be made of a crow quill, or a common pen may serve with the nib much finer
and harder than is used for common writing; but Wise's Steel Pens, are in every
respect preferable; if a black lead pencil, a very hard one, of such a quality as
Brookman and Langdon's, marked H H H will best answer the purpose.

A General and concluding Observation.
Although the preceding pages contain such clear and precise rules as cannot fail
rendering this the most universal and consise system of Stenography of any ex
tant; yet there may be some of my readers not inclined to give themselves the trouble
of learning them, though indeed that is very trival from their being presented in the
form of Poetry; to such it will be satisfactory when informed, that by using the
Facilographic characters, and only omitting the vowels,and one consonant out ofevery
double consonant, (in words were two consonants of the same kind meet together,)
they will have a very easy and concise Short-hand, applicable to most purposes to
which Stenography is generally applied. - - - - * -
