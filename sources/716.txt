 Chicago, IL.  Publisher: Guiding Star Publishing Company.  Editor: Cyrus R. Teed, editor and proprietor.  Succeeded by: The Flaming Sword 1/1, December 1, 1886-3/5, May 1889.  $1.00-$2.00 a year, 32-48 pp.  Devoted to Teed's ("Koresh's") World's College of Life and Society Arch Triumphant.  Teed's advocacy of communal communism, celibacy, and the hollow earth theory has overshadowed  his other ideas, but this journal reveals his intimate connections with the early "mind cure" movement, especially in Chicago, where Teed had been invited in order to address the National Association of Mental Science in 1886.  He and the students of his College were indistinguishable as healers from the numerous mind-cure healers in Chicago and even advocated the controversial practice of "absent healing"-mail-order cures-for $5.00.  The journal, largely written by Teed himself, strove to distinguish itself from the "spurious" Christian Science of Mary Baker Eddy and from Christianity, Swedenborgianism, Theosophy and spiritualism, and was principally devoted to "celibacy"-the conserving of the "dynamis," the virtue or healing potency, to achieve "regeneration," bi-sexual unity, physical immortality (a concept Teed claimed to have invented), and the transformation of the world in the new age.  "The ultimate potential energy of man's being is the seed of man."  Mere conservation of the sexual energy, however, was not enough for Teed.  The energy conserved and accumulated had to be directed toward him as Cyrus/messiah of the new era:  "The centralization of the pneumic and psychic forces, which in other words is the flow of spirits and souls to the one Messianic center, will be effected by the cognition of this center, and the direction of the desires of all who look for the Lord's coming, towards this cognized pivot as the true Sign, the Messenger of the Covenant, the true Shepherd of the sheep."
