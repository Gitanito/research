 &nbsp; &nbsp;     Periodical:  Der Prophet (Munich)</I>      

    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

  Prophet, Der.
 Zukunfts-Almanach fur [1867] mit monatlichen Prophezeihungen.
 1867  Annual
 Munich, Germany.
 Publisher: G.H. Gummi.
  1/1, 1867. 
 72 pp.

  This appeared in 1867 as an annual almanac with monthly predictions for the coming year, based on vague references to astrology, but most of the content of the surviving issue was given over to a "novel of the future" about the fates of Napoleon III and Wilhelm I.  Although the journal bears the designation of volume I, Gummi had been publishing versions of it since at least 1852 when it bore the title: "The Prophet, or the Delphic Oracle . . . in which people could find unveiled the discovery of future things, fates, and strokes of luck."
