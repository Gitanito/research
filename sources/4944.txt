Mostyn Gilbert joined the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1962, and was also later involved with Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP).

As secretary of the SPR’s Survival Joint Research Committee Gilbert was instrumental in bringing together spiritualists and scientists, notably Maurice Barbanell, a trance medium and the founding editor of Psychic News, and Alan Mayne, a scientist and mathematician, for the purposes of investigating survival.

He published commentary in the SPR’s journal on controversies relating to William Crookes’s research with mediums,1 also on other mediumship matters, table turning, electronic voice phenomena, and the history of nineteenth-century spiritualism. His unpublished articles and extensive correspondence can be found in the SPR archives housed at Cambridge University Library. These include files devoted to the Trevor Hall court case in 1966; the mediums Annie Eva Fay, George Valiantine, William Eglinton and Rosina Mary Showers; and correspondence with James Randi, Arthur Koestler, ER Dodds and Eric Dingwall.

Gilbert wrote and collected articles on spiritualism in Brazil, ESP in the American airforce, precognition, and the ‘Seaside Palmists’.2

Gilbert also helped his friend and fellow SPR council member Eric Dingwall in the preparation of his book The Critic's Dilemma.3  Archive Work

Gilbert edited the SPR archives index, supervised by Mollie Goldney and ER Dodds,4 although this work had not been completed when he resigned from the SPR in 1973.

He also catalogued the collection of the Britten Memorial Library in Manchester, which was later transferred to the Spiritualists’ National Union headquarters in Stansted, Essex.  Selected Articles
