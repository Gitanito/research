PRICE.— For quick, far-reaching distribution, this book
will be sold to the public at the low uniform price of
FIVE DOLLARS, postpaid anywhere. It is a practical,
proven study. Morgan, the great financier, in every inter­
view with business people caught in the first few seconds
of their conversation exactly what was in the mind of the
visitor. He claimed that the gift of knowing what was
wanted made possible the doing of the vast amount of
business he handled daily. Skill in practical use of
“ thought transference” was worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars to him. You can make this study worth much
to you.
ASSOCIATED WORK. As a Post-Graduate course to the
present lessons we recommend Shaftesbury’s remarkable
new book, “ THE GREAT PSYCHIC— The Master Mind
of the Universe,” briefly described on the last pages of
this volume. We explain there how you may obtain this
$5 book FREE.

Preface and Plan of Study
U ST at the time when we were delivering the manuscript
A of this book to the printer there appeared in the news-
(§ J papers of America an article cabled from Paris and
headed “Radio Picks U p W aves F rom H uman
Brain.” It read, in part, as follows:
“ Sound waves from a human brain have been picked up
by a radio receiver on a four to ten metre wave length. . . .
As a result Professor Cazzamali foresees the transmission of
sound waves from one brain to another. He says he is led to
believe that the waves sent out from the brain of one person
under certain conditions might be picked up by the brain of
another person under similar nervous, mental or hypnotic
stress.”
And a newspaper editor, following this report, with some
alarm published an editorial in which he said: “If it is true
that the brain gives out radio waves and that there is now being
developed apparatus that will receive them and thus disclose the
thoughts that race around inside our heads, then a fearful time
has come. No longer will ‘A penny for your thoughts’ be the
vogue, for science will already know your thought and will
probably have decided that a penny would be an over-valuation
of it. Imagine what the world would be if the workings of the
mind could be detected with scientific accuracy. . . . There
would be no privacy of thought. Your brain would make noises
for all the world to hear. One could never even be alone with
one’s self. There would always be someone ‘listening in’. . . .
There are some people whose brains never function and who
therefore would suffer no inconvenience from the radio eaves­
dropping, but for most people it would be a horrible thing.”
Thus does present day science and the press confirm the
practical and valuable field of training which we shall open to
the public in the lessons now before us. Today it is undisputed
that the mind is capable of sending forth and receiving thoughts
in other ways than by the known channels of the senses. This
4 PREFACE AND PLAN OF STUDY
volume is not experimental; it has had a predecessor; and faith­
ful students have tested the methods prescribed for a better
understanding of a faculty which, fifteen years ago, was receiv­
ing its first scientific recognition at the hands of careful and
conscientious investigators.
The present purpose is to extend the scope and usefulness
of the work, and to preserve, in record form, the general results
of a wide range of experiments, reduced to scientific laws, and
applied to a system of principles. In carrying out this purpose
the author has freely drawn from many sources, from the
labors of others, from scores of books, from experiments of
societies, and from private correspondence. Credit is due to
numerous writers for help received; although acknowledgment
in detail is not given as the field has been too general.
The plan of instruction decided upon is this: You are first
given a series of crisp, power-packed lessons on the subject of
M ind and T hought. To be able to intelligently use Thought
Transference, you must first know what thought is. You must
know what the Mind is in which thought originates, or in
which it is to be received from some other originating mind-
radio. Also you must make your own Brain a powerful think­
ing machine in order to get maximum results in the use of
thought transference. Hence, to enable you to quickly achieve
these results the author carries you through thirty-six lessons
in “Mind and T hought.” Following this division, he then
opens into the main part of the system of thought trans­
ference, in which he explains the newly-discovered laws of
radio-communication between brain and brain.
In submitting this volume to the verdict of the public the
one aim and hope of the author is to rescue a noble theme from
the hands of charlatans and pretenders, who have too long
played upon the superstition of the public, and have taken
advantage of the mystery that seems to surround the sub­
conscious operations of the mind. The evidence is over­
whelming that this faculty is a natural and perfectly healthful
function of the brain, and it is today recognized as the germ
of a more splendid capacity.

MIND AND THOUGHT
FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES
iHE study of Mind and Thought stands for the great­
est advance in civilization that the world has ever
known; and for the highest development of personal
power in the individual. To these ends the teachings
of this book are brought to a level never before reached in any
system of instruction, and they are based on the following
general principles:
1. It has long been suspected by the ablest thinkers and
investigators, that thought and matter are one and the same,
but different forms of each other; that every substance is a con­
dition assumed by thought, and is thought itself.
2. The men whose names shine forth as the leaders of
modern knowledge, have found their researches tending to one
conclusion: that the universe is filled with thought, which is
ever-present, all-powerful and omniscient; occupying all space,
and throbbing in every part of the sky and in all created matter,
including life of every kind, material and otherwise. The sub­
lime philosophy of Emerson, which is accepted by all theolo­
gians, touched the verge of this conclusion and showed the
way to it in one direction, but fell short of the goal.
3. The purpose of this universal thought has been, and is,
to take form; first by building of itself material abodes in
which to live as tenants from the lowest conditions of intelli­
gence to the highest estate of the human mind. This process
of taking form accounts for all things that are, for all life
that exists, and for the presence of man on earth.
IO MIND AND THOUGHT
4. The human body is a part of the universal thought,
and the human mind is universal thought itself. That the latter
has absolute power over the former is proved by the teachings
of this book.
5. It is the common experience of man to possess a power
that he does not exercise. He does not know his own strength;
like the caged lion who contents himself with remaining in a
narrow abode that he could tear to pieces in a minute if he knew
he had the ability to do so.
6. All forms follow laws that seem blind; for they pro­
ceed along regular routes, and are swayed by the conditions
that surround them. The human mind is a type of this drift­
ing. It is the slave of habits, both in thinking and in acting;
and, like the lion in captivity, does not know that there is a
vast range of freedom close at hand that may be had by the
least effort.
7. The physical body is a part of the universal thought,
left to the influence of these blind laws. The trouble with the
human mind is that it permits itself to be controlled by the
physical conditions of the body; when the opposite is intended.
It has been proved that the mind can master the body; but the
body actually masters the physical mind. This study is formed
for the purpose of reversing such condition, and showing the
way to results that are worth attaining.
8. When the mind turns from the influences of the body,
and looks outwardly to the source of its own existence, it then
is in touch with the universal thought. Some of the powers
that belong to that source from which it sprung, come to it.
A clearness of knowledge is one of those powers. This fact
is so readily proved and can be so easily brought home to every
person that it is worth seeking.
9. This truth is self-evident. It is reasonable, practical
and sensible. Every thinking person knows that life consists
of physical influences holding mastery over the physical mind.
The slave rules the master. For the first time in the history
of the world, let the master rule the slave. A new view of life
will follow. A new civilization will come upon the earth.
“WHAT IS THOUGHT” i i
Wrongs of every kind spring from physical conditions. The
master-mind can do no wrong.
LESSON I
“WHAT IS THOUGHT?”
1. It has been said that if you can be made to understand
what thought is, you can be made to understand anything.
2. There are endless problems in the universe, and most
of them are so deep and profound that it would seem impossible
to secure a vital understanding of them. But the deepest and
most profound of all, is the problem of thought.
3. The greater includes the less. If thought is the deep­
est and most profound of all the great problems of the uni­
verse, and if you can be made to understand what thought is,
then all other problems are lesser and a clear realization of their
meaning should be within your grasp.
4. Let us try to solve this greatest of all things. If you
take a piece of iron in your hand, you are tempted to say, it is
solid and will endure; but it rusts. Rust is the changing of its
matter. If you behold the solid granite, you will believe that
it can never lose its mighty strength; but it is always crumbling,
although time alone proves the fact; you cannot see the changes
going on. A handful of earth is the result of change, and is
in process of change. Nothing is permanent.
5. In the secret recesses of the earth, there are masses
of solid and liquid matter that are now undergoing change.
Wherever matter exists it is passing through changes. The
fine parts of which it is composed are separating, and are try­
ing to get away from each other. When free, they seek new
combinations with other particles. They are always tearing
down and building up.
6. This is the story of the universe in a nutshell. Every­
where there is unrest; everywhere there is separation, dissolu­
tion, breaking down, and rebuilding. When a fact is known,
it becomes a lever by which other facts can be reached.
12 MIND AND THOUGHT
7. This eternal change takes place in the particles that
make up any mass, whether living or without life; and it sooner
or later causes the complete change of the mass whether living
or without life. Thus the restlessness of the particles that com­
pose the human body will bring on age and death in spite of
every effort humanity may make to prevent such end.
8. It is this change that has brought on the area of civiliza­
tion, that has compelled nature to improve all her species, that
has given the world thousands of varieties of beautiful flowers
where once none existed, that has drawn new forces out of old
ones until the world has been made anew, and that is impelling
the human mind to employ these new forces for the coming on
of the age of mind and thought that is destined to outshine all
ages of the past.
9. There is not in the body, or out of it, in the earth, or on
it, or anywhere in all the universe a particle of matter that is
not charged with the great command, Change!
10. Such a command, such a latent force, must be the result
of some power beyond itself, or else of some power of which
it is a part. Can you grasp this meaning? All that you think
and feel and do, may be directed by some power beyond your­
self, or by some power of which you are a part. In either case
the principle is the same; there is some power at work in this
endless unrest of matter. You exist as a living mass, and as a
collection of particles; and the latter controls the mass. In each
part and particle change is going on for a purpose, and this
change is being thought out at every stage by a living mind
that knows no rest and no slumber.
LESSON II
“UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE”
1. It makes no difference what the particle of matter is,
its parts will eventually separate and make new combinations.
More than this, what is one kind will become another kind in
" UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE" 13
time. Enough has been learned of this changing of matter to
prove that there is but one kind of original atom.
2. It is the way that the atoms combine that produces gold,
or rock, or other substance. Gold is ever corroding, although
very slowly. Its tarnish is the breaking down of its atoms from
their gold formation into free parts ready to take up new com­
binations, some of which will some day enter into human bodies,
or plants, flowers or other things.
3. Some day the thought of man will convert one sub­
stance into another. Gold and jewels will be produced by
human activities. This is the coming wonder of the nearby age,
as the wireless message is the wonder of today, and the voice of
the phonograph, now forgotten as a marvel, was once regarded
as an impossibility. The mind and thought of man must take
advantage of the fact that all substances are giving up their
atoms into new combinations, and that change is constant.
4. When attracted by other matter, free atoms will enter
into the pleasing work of making living masses, such as ani­
mals, or plants, or human beings. We cannot catch one of these
atoms, but we can look upon their work in the form of the first
combinations that make living masses. These are called life-
cells. All over the earth, free atoms are seeking such a partner­
ship. The life-cell begins each living mass.
5. If the purpose of the combination is an oak tree, the
first cell will set about producing the oak tree. This cell con­
trols not only the destiny of the mass, but determines whether it
will be a tree or not, and what kind of a tree, whether apple,
maple, oak, or other kind. The future is locked up in the cell.
6. The cell is so small that it requires a powerful micro­
scope to make it visible. Yet it controls the destiny of the living
mass to be.
7. Under close inspection the cell shows that it is com­
posed of material that enters into its growth; and of a mechan­
ical power like machinery that carries on the process of growth;
and, above all, of a mental force that directs the machinery.
There is a brain in every cell in nature. Thus the three depart­
ments of every living mass are found in a cell so small that it
14 MIND AND THOUGHT
cannot be seen except by the most powerful magnifying appa­
ratus; there is the material body, the mechanical activity of
life; and the governing intelligence.
8. Such a cell may make a rose bush, or a pear tree, or
a grape vine, or an animal, or a human being. You began
once in a single cell. The gigantic animal of the jungle began
in a single cell. The grand tree of the forest began in a single
cell. Each cell was wonderfully small; yet under the micro­
scope it was a world of energy and activity.
9. What was that intelligence that we call the brain of the
cell? No theory is necessary. If that cell held in itself the
destiny of a human being, it is clear to be seen that the tiny
brain carried the command to create the human being from
that cell, adding to itself the free atoms about it.
10. Thus far we have two forces at work. One is the
tearing down of all matter by making free atoms; and the
building up of living masses by attracting those free atoms;
every step of the progress of building up being controlled by
a cell-brain. But what brain causes the masses of matter to
break down and set their atoms free? No brain is seen in a
stone or a nugget of gold.
LESSON III
“BRAIN BEGINNINGS”
1. Two great facts have thus far been secured. The first
is the presence of a living brain in every life-cell. The second
is the presence of unceasing restlessness in all particles of
matter that are not life-cells.
2. As all matter is in one class or the other, either life-
cells or inanimate masses, it follows that there is nothing in
the universe that is not subject to one form of control or the
other.
3. When matter enters into a life-cell, it is controlled by
the brain that is present in that cell. When matter is not in a
“BRAIN BEGINNINGS” 15
life-cell, it is controlled by a power that is general. These facts
are admitted everywhere, as they are easily proved. No person
denies them. They indeed stand as the basic truths of all
knowledge of life.
4. In order to proceed aright, it is necessary to remember
all the time that matter is divided into two classes: that which
is called inanimate, and that which is a part of life either in the
vegetable or the animal kingdom. Matter that is inanimate is
swayed by a power that is general; and this power compels such
matter to undergo constant change. Matter that is a part of
life is controlled by its own brain which governs it as a cell.
5. A life-cell is made up of inanimate matter governed by
a brain. This brain governs the cell as a life-form, while the
inanimate matter of which it is composed is governed by the
general power referred to.
6. The general power that controls inanimate matter says
to it: “Break away and become free.” The brain that controls
each life-cell says to it: “ Get together and build something
that will live.”
7. All things in heaven and earth are ruled by these two
laws: “Get free,” and “Build.” They are not accidental laws.
They follow a fixed plan. They are working out a certain
destiny. They are the result of thought. Of this there can be
no doubt.
8. There is thought everywhere. It is locked up in the
dense and solid masses that are hidden in the remotest recesses
of the globe; it is present in every inactive and inanimate sub­
stance on the surface of the earth, seeking ever to push its
atoms out into freedom so that they may be caught up by the
builder; and it impels all the forces that make life out of the
atoms thus set free. You cannot take up anything that is, you
cannot look upon life or inert matter, without reading in it the
presence of thought.
9. Where there is thought, there must be the thinker. All
effects have their cause, except the first great power that filled
all the universe, and that was thought. In the work that
climaxes this course of study, it is shown most clearly that uni-
16 MIND AND THOUGHT
versal thought preceded all matter; and the same great work
shows the processes by which the material world became the
offspring of thought alone.
io. If matter could be found that would never change,
then we could believe that all thought had gone out of it; but
as long as it will set its atoms free, then so long must it be
controlled by a never dying thought. Whatever is builded must
be made of something. Atoms set free become the material of
the builder; and what is builded is life. The easiest steps in
building life is in the plant world; the more difficult steps are
in the lower forms of animal life; and the greatest tax on
the builder is in the making of humanity, for we shall see that
thought has produced itself in masses there.
LESSON IV
‘‘HOW THOUGHT BEGAN”
1. The act of matter setting its atoms free in order that
they may be employed in building life, is a step forward. You
would not care to be told how those atoms got to this earth
from the far distant parts of the sky. It would seem like a
step backward.
2. The only way in which the fact may serve us in this
work is in the proof of the assertion that at one time all matter
was free, and that it was transported from the distant realms
of space into this part of the heavens by the agency of light.
If you owned a world that weighed billions times billions of
tons, and if you wished to send that world millions of miles
across the sky, you would not know how to do it. It would
take thought to devise a plan.
3. Light is the only agency that carries matter. A ray of
light is a line of matter. It is thinner than any matter we know
of, but it is heavier than thought. It is a procession of matter.
Once people thought that the air that surrounds this earth was
“HOW THOUGHT BEGAN” 17
thinner than anything else in existence; but now air is known
to have great weight and great material power. Many gases are
lighter than air, but all gases are heavy in fact
4. All space between the worlds of the sky is filled with
ether, and this ether is so thin that it travels through solids
easily, even through the human body and all its parts; even
through diamonds that seem to be wholly solid, but which in ,
fact are more porous than sponges when seen through the
microscope.
5. Ether then would seem so thin that it could not be
called substance; but light is much thinner, and ether is made
up of condensed light, while matter, so-called, is made up of
condensed ether; just as the most solid substances on this globe
may come from parts of the atmosphere that have been con­
densed. When fire destroys property, the flames take it up in
the form of gases that are suspended in the air until they may
again enter into newly made solids.
6. While light is thinner than the universal ether, it is
known to be material in its nature. It travels a million miles
in a little over five seconds. In the climax work, we show that
light is the offspring of universal thought, and that this uni­
versal thought once dwelt alone in the sky before any worlds
were made.
7. Universal thought is able to create rays, which are
processions of matter. Light becomes the universal ether that
pervades all matter. The universal ether, by further condensa­
tion or union through attraction, makes atoms.
8. All atoms are alike. It is the way in which they make
particles that determines what the chemical element is to be.
The instability of every chemical element shows the fact that
all elements are interchangeable; that lead may become gold,
and so on.
9. The law of attraction is thought. It is everywhere active.
All atoms become particles, and these make elements. From the
elements are builded all masses of matter, and all life-cells.
From these are made the vegetable and the animal kingdoms,
ending with humanity. But thought is ever present in each
i8 MIND AND THOUGHT
part of matter and in each cell; in every process and in all
that results.
io. Universal thought resolved itself into light. Light,
being processions, was brought together by attraction and be­
came the universal ether. Ether, by the further activity of
attraction, became particles, and star dust and planet dust filled
the sky, out of which all worlds were created by the same law
of attraction, which means condensation. Thought is in every
particle of matter, and every particle of matter is the result of
thought. Every law is thought. Gravity is thought. Nothing
that lives or that is lifeless is free from thought.
LESSON V
“MATTER IS THOUGHT”
1. The order of the unfolding of life and matter has been
stated in the preceding lesson, which shows the presence of
thought in everything. The fact is set forth that thought is
never absent in anything that is living or that lacks life. Now
comes the one difficult fact to grasp, which proceeds to the
origin of all matter and all life; meaning the creation of the
universe.
2. As shown by steps and series of proofs that are made
self-evident in the climax work of this study, there was once
an area in which the whole sky was filled with the power of
thought, and nothing else was present. Thought is finer than
light, as light is finer than ether, ether is finer than atoms,
atoms are smaller than particles, and particles are smaller thati
substances.
3. Thought therefore is the basis of all matter. What is
called solidity is a sensation of a mighty force produced by a
power overwhelming in its greatness as compared with the
human being that comes in contact with it. But the ablest men
of this age have worked out the plan of the starry worlds that
exist in space, and have compared a grain of sand to the uni-
“MATTER IS THOUGHT’ 19
verse, showing that the atoms that make up the grain of sand
are as far from each other as the stars of the sky are distant.
Solidity therefore is a mere sensation, for the universe is not
solid with stars.
4. What is called weight, as when we say a mass of gold
or lead is heavy, is a mere thought. What holds this earth in
bondage to the sun more than ninety millions miles away?
Surely not a cord, nor a chain, nor a rod, nor anything tangible.
It is attraction. But what is attraction ? Is it material, ethereal,
or spiritual ? It is the command of a power that is able to com­
pel one substance to hold another under its sway. The moon
cannot get free from the earth, yet nothing real keeps it in
leash. Every object on the globe is attracted to the earth; but
how? It is easy to see why; for, in the absence of attraction,
every object on the planet would soon be drifting in space, and
nothing could remain here. But how is it done ? The power of
attraction is gravity, and it is absolute evidence of thought.
In the absence of gravity, your child would, on the first step,
start off into space unless you tied him to this world; but the
cord with which you tied him must have holding strength, and
that is thought. If you nail an object to the earth to keep it
here, the nail must have adhesion and friction, and these both
are thought.
5. Bulk and weight are the only two qualities that seem
to depart from the first nature of thought; but both these quali­
ties are necessary for the creation of worlds and of living
beings. Bulk is the result of attraction which brings atoms to
each other, and weight keeps the mass in place. Let either bulk
or weight be lacking and nothing could take form. An object
must have form, and life must have form. Thought has made
these possible.
6. There are so many phenomena that cannot be ex­
plained on any other basis except that thought is matter, and
matter is the form of thought, or thought taking upon itself
the qualities of substances and living beings, that long ago the
ablest thinkers of this age came to the conclusion that the mate­
rial universe itself was nothing more than thought taking form.
20 MIND AND THOUGHT
7. The mind that has not given the problem attention will
at once ask how it is possible for thought and matter to be the
same. The answer is given in the preceding lessons and will
be found upon a careful review of them.
8. Thought is universal. It is in matter, and in all space
between matter. All matter is restless because it is thought,
and all thought is active because it seeks form. There <can be
no thought that does not relate to its products. It is an easy
task to prove that all that is spiritual is form of matter; that
mind and spirit are thought that has not yet taken form as
matter or substance; and this proof does not in any degree
lessen the character of thought or spiritual life.
9. Thought when it collects its atoms into the form of
substance is called matter; but when it collects its direct force
into a controlling power placed in a life-cell, it is intelligence,
or the brain of that cell; and when it collects a larger form of
brain energy in a living being, it becomes the seat of the mind.
Everything that exists is some degree of thought. Substances
having bulk and weight are condensed forms of thought made
up of atoms held closely together; yet we know that every
atom is charged with the thought that gave it its purpose.
10. Thought, before it combines into masses of atoms, is
wholly spiritual; which means that it is a power over itself
and over all forms that come forth from itself. The first
essence of thought is its all-powerfulness. It can accomplish
everything. The second essence of thought is its universal
presence; it is everywhere, in everything and controlling every­
thing. The third essence of thought is its all-knowing power;
it knows everything, and nothing escapes its vision. The
fourth essence of thought is its attention to matters small and
great. No particle exists without its guiding care, and no
world is too large for its directing influence. The science of
mathematics does not contain figures enough to compute the
scope of its sway, nor the cubic area of its dominion; yet each
atom is carried forward to its certain destiny by this all-
prevailing master of life.
“A POWERFUL MIND” 21
LESSON VI
“A POWERFUL MIND”
1. Do you want a powerful mind? Then come into har­
mony with the great facts of the universe by making for your­
self proofs of the nature of thought. Thought is all-powerful,
ever-present, all-knowing; and no atom is small enough to
escape its attention, nor is any world large enough to be with­
out its guiding influence. You and your mind are parts of
this great thought.
2. If you wish to build up a powerful mind, you may do
so by increasing your knowledge of these great qualities of
thought. Day by day you will unfold new lines of activity
which will bring you the greatest rewards of life. Take, for
example, a single quality of universal thought: its ever-
presence. You do not have to search in far off realms for the
proofs. They are at hand, all about you. It is said by some
authorities that there are more than one hundred thousand evi­
dences of the ever-present activity of thought; but to say there
are a million at least, is nearer the truth. But can you find a
thousand?
3. You are to build up a powerful mind, to make your
brain fertile in ideas, and your whole being a closer part of the
universal thought. To do this, be practical. Thought is prac­
tical, not visionary. Get a blank book, or any sheets of blank
paper and keep a record; for the review of what your own
brain produces is the quickest way of building up a great mind.
Write down everything that offers itself as proof of the ever­
present nature of thought. The first dozen ideas will come
sluggishly; the next group will come more readily; and finally
you will have thoughts coming into your brain faster than you
can note them down.
4. Take as the basic principle that, if thought were not
ever-present it would fail wherever it was lacking in the crea­
tion of this earth. A single idea would create a ball or mass
on which nothing could live. Special attention, specific details,
22 MIND AND THOUGHT
purposed design, not alone in great things, but in the smallest
parts of this planet, are everywhere seen. No power can pro­
duce something from nothing. Universal thought always ex­
isted. But there was a time when all was void and without
form. Yet thought then existed, as is easily proved in two
great methods, both exactly agreeing. Thought gave itself into
light, light into ether, ether into atoms, and from atoms came
forth form and life. As thought is matter, and matter is
thought, as life is thought and thought is life, all existence is
thought shaped into form and life. Therefore it should not be
difficult to find proofs in little things as well as in great things,
of the ever-present power of thought.
5. As has been said, there are probably more than a mil­
lion evidences of this one quality; and you are to find one
thousand only and note them in your book. Then there are
other qualities that can be traced through the forms of matter
and life, in just the same way. Your mind will expand, your
brain will come into its own, and your own existence will be
wonderfully broadened by your coming into closer touch with
the universal thought of which you are a part.
6. Look for proofs that thinking has been done. If you
believe that things came into being without cause and without
purpose, your mind is weak, and needs the stimulus of these
lessons. If you believe that the laws that govern life are blind
and aimless, your mind is weak, and these teachings will show
it the way to strength and truth.
7. The first step to take is to build in your brain a scheme
of creation such as would follow the absence of specific
thought.
8. The next step is to ask yourself why this world was
created.
9. The third step is to think out how the material came
here out of which the world was made.
10. The final step is to make your records as required in
the next lesson.
“BUILDING YOUR MIND” 23
LESSON VII
“BUILDING YOUR MIND”
1. It has been shown that thought is universal, all-power­
ful, all-knowing, ever-present, and in all things, animate and
inanimate. It has been shown that thought is matter, and mat­
ter is thought. It has been shown that you are, body and mind,
a part of the universal thought that fills all creation. It will
be shown in the most conclusive manner that you can bring
your own mind very close to the universal mind, and that by
a very simple process.
2. The principle is this: If you have a vivid dream and
write down, at the first moment of waking, the strongest de­
tails, every future review of those details will excite into action
the function of the mind that gave birth to the dream. Or it is
this: If there shall come to you in your waking hours, some
flash of thought, invention or vital idea of high value, and
write down in concrete form the details just as they sprang
into your mind, every review of those details will excite into
action the function of the brain that gave them birth. By this
method has every genius proceeded in the past.
3. There was once an era when all the sky was void and
without form. Of this fact there is not the slightest doubt.
It is proved in many ways by science. But thought prevailed
everywhere. Out of that thought came form, and out of form
came life. In order to make form out of thought, thought
itself was compelled to give itself into the making of form and
of life. It took thought to plan form. Thought is the process
of thinking, planning and deciding what to do. The principle
now is this: If you take the results of thought and think out
what purpose is in them, what planning made them, what idea
lives in their form, you will open up the same function of the
mind that gave birth to these evidences of thinking.
4. Whenever you find in nature some proof of special
design you will put your mind back to that era when it took
part in planning the universe; for you had a share in creation,
but do not know it.
24- MIND AND THOUGHT
5. It cannot be pretended that your mind is something
apart from the great power that made it. Every atom is a por­
tion of the whole. The work ahead is to find the way to know
what you are; dormant powers must be given the right of
birth.
6. Thought made every part of your body and your mind ;
and both your body and mind are thought itself, not separatej
facts. In your body there dwells a living mind, capable of re­
uniting itself with the universal mind of which it is a part. All
it lacks is consciousness of the facts. i
7. When this consciousness is set up, then a light of un­
limited range will enter your life. The process must be prac­
tical. It is based on the principle stated : the awakening of th^
dormant functions of the mind.
8. Imagine that you are universal thought and that you
wish to create matter that shall have form. You have np
material except all-powerful thought, which is yourself. How
shall it take form? If it is all-powerful, it will be able to con­
dense itself into light, and condense light into ether, ether into!
atoms, and atoms into masses by attraction.
9. But masses must have every kind of endowment, and
elements are needed. Thought thinks out what variation^
should prevail, and what their different-natures- should be. The
elements must combine, for form is the result of building up.
10. It is in the ideas that have been given to the world in|
elemental combinations that we see the most startling proofs
of the power and the scope of universal thought. This is work
for the next lesson. !
LESSON VIII
“FASCINATING ESSAYS”
1. A condition of the universe in which nothing at all
existed would be impossible. But a condition in which no so-
called material existed would be a necessity. As thought is
undoubtedly the creator of material, it alone could have occu-|
25
“FASCINATING E SSA YS*
*
pied space prior to the era in which material appeared. Thought
is in everything. The purpose now is to find it, not merely in
atoms and particles, but in elements and masses, or what is
called form, having built up life out of itself, not by one leap,
but by processes that seem very slow to us; as the day-life of a
butterfly seems a span of many decades to that insect.
2. Writing an idea gives it a concrete form that doubles
its value; it comes out of the brain and passes back to the brain.
An essay in these lessons is a written statement made by your­
self on any one theme. It should contain not less than three
hundred words. The essay system on the subjects that deal
with the resources of thought is sure to build up a strong mind
for you if you are faithful to the duty assigned.
3. The first essay is on the following theme: “The har­
mony of universal thought with religious belief.” On this sub­
ject you are to write an essay, if you will, of not less than
three hundred words and make it valuable to yourself. No
matter what may be your religious belief, universal thought
will agree with it, for this is the wonderful quality of this
great law. Surprising as it may seem to you at first, universal
thought will explain every doubt you may have, will confirm
every belief, will solve all the problems in human creeds and
show that they are one, and will meet every difficulty of every
kind.
4. The next theme for an essay is this: “There is a reason
for everything and in everything.” The poet said, “Whatever
is, is right.” This assertion is true, no matter what may be the
objection to it from a wrong viewpoint. It is hard to believe
that wrong is right, but you can ascertain the truth of the fact
by deeper investigation into the purposes of universal thought.
Your mind will grow fast when you are able to grasp this
great law.
5. Two foundation principles have thus far been dealt
with in your essays. If you have a religious belief you must
not let it go, nor allow it to be modified by any teachings; for
the chances are a million to one that your belief is right. The
best proof will be found in your first essay. If what you write
26 MIND AND THOUGHT
does not seem the best you can do, go over the subject again,
and write a new essay on the same theme. Then when you
have written an essay on the second theme, to prove that there
is a reason for everything and in everything, try to improve it
by later editions of the same essay. It is important that you
shall grow in stature up to the meaning and purpose of these
two foundation laws of life.
6. If whatever is, is wrong in whole or in part, then some
power is to blame, for a human being is what he is. The can­
nibal who eats human flesh, the Zulu who tortures, the Indian
who scalps, the student who hazes, are what they are born to
be. A disposition that rebounds to the bad as soon as some
good influence is withdrawn, is always bad no matter how
peaceful it may be under restraint. It is what is in the indi­
vidual for possibilities, that determines what he is. And this is
inborn. Can it be right? If not, then the power that made it
is wrong. But can a creative power be wrong? If not, then
the seeming wrong of a bad man is serving a purpose that can­
not be understood at first glance; and it will require some think­
ing on your part to reach the true conclusion. Try it. It is
most interesting and most fascinating. But it is time that you
took a new view of life.
7. Having advanced in mental strength by solving the
two basic laws of existence, you should come down to the prac­
tical themes of life. The third essay is to be written on the
following theme: “Of what use is a tree?” Take all the uses,
living and dead. Then follow with different essays, every one
of not less than three hundred words, on each of the following
themes:
“ Why were all trees not made of soft wood?”
“W hy are some trees made to furnish very hard wood,
some a wood that will take a polish, some of light wood, and
some fire-wood?”
You must find evidences of thought in every kind of
wood.
“ Why is vapor lighter than water ?”
“ What thought is shown in steam?”
"FASCINATING ESSAYS” 27
“What thought is shown in gravity?”
“ In the absence of gravity what would happen?”
“Why is ice lighter than water?”
“State all the services performed by rain?”
“What advantages arise from the fact that the oceans
are salt?”
“State all the advantages of snow?”
“ What are all the uses of hard stone?”
“ How many kinds of usefulness come from all kinds of
stone?”
“ What evidence of thought is found in lime and cement?”
“What are the uses of the precious metals?”
“ What are the uses of iron?”
“What are the uses of copper?”
“What are the uses of lead?”
“What are the uses of the other base metals?”
“What are the uses of the precious stones?”
“What evidences of thought are found in the food sys­
tems of nature?”
“What evidences of thought are found in the fuel sys­
tems of nature?”
“What evidences of thought are found in the building
supplies of nature?”
“ What is clothing, and how many great classes of re­
sources in nature are there that provide clothing?”
“What supplies are provided by nature for the beauti­
fying of buildings?”
“What is paper and how obtained?”
“What are the uses of cord, string, twine and rope?”
“What are the methods by which water is supplied from
nature ?”
“What evidences of thought are found in colors?”
“What evidences of thought are found in the various
tools used by workmen, and what will these tools accomplish ?”
“What are the uses of electricity?”
“ State all the uses of glass.”
“State all the uses of sand.”
28 MIND AND THOUGHT
“State all the uses of clay.”
“ State all the uses of china ware, earthen ware and
pottery.”
“State all the uses of cloth.”
“State all the uses of wool.”
“State all the uses of leather.”
“ State all the uses of animals that are helpful to hu­
manity.”
“State all the uses of flowers.”
“ State all the uses of light.”
“ State all the uses of the four seasons.”
“ State all the uses of day and night.”
“What mechanical powers exist in nature?”
“What mechanical powers have animals and humanity?”
“What faculties are possessed by humanity and what are
their uses?”
“What is memory, and what are its uses?”
“ If a human being lacked memory what would his life
be?”
“Why does the heart beat for a lifetime without stop-
pmg?
“Why do the lungs breathe for a lifetime without stop­
ping?”
In the last two essays, the methods and causes must be
explained.
“What are the relations of memory to identity?”
“What are the uses of parental love?”
“What is articulative speech in all its details?”
“What evidences of thought are found in the creation of
language ?”
“ On what natural laws are all the great inventions
based?”
8. Thousands of subjects for essays could be added ; but
the foregoing will serve to excite your mental powers into
deeper channels of thinking, and this is the kind of develop­
ment that you most need.
9. Some of the subjects are truly philosophical, such
«VAST WONDERS OF THOUGHT’’ 29
as the inquiry, “ If a human being lacked memory, what would
his life be?” If you today have no knowledge of yourself of
yesterday, it is exactly the same in result as if you were wholly
someone else from day to day. If you should totally lose
knowledge of yourself at death, a future life would in no way
be connected with your personality.
10. The inquiry as to what would result if gravity were
removed, is likewise fruitful of thinking. Every object would
leave the earth on the first slight impulse, and never return.
You could hang all your clothes on the air at any height you
pleased; but the least disturbance would set them going to be
gone forever. If you were to take one step in walking, the lift­
ing up of the body would mean your speedy removal into space
unless you could fasten yourself to earth. There are thousands
of instances that you can cite to make this essay a great pro­
duction.
LESSON IX
“VAST WONDERS OF THOUGHT”
1. You will not have gone far in the preceding lesson
with your essays before you begin to realize the great scope of
thought. Nothing is too small to be charged with thought
of the highest importance; and nothing is too mighty to be
free from its control.
2. When you take a pen to write, you may wonder at
the fact that the material on which to pen your ideas is before
you; and how came it into existence? If you open your
mouth to speak, you may marvel at the fact that a column of
air, vibrating in the throat, will produce sound; that the
vowels are made by moulding that air column by positions as­
sumed by the lips and other parts; that consonants are inter­
ruptions of that flow of sound; while spoken words are com­
binations of these vowels and consonants, all being variations
of a column of air that the larnyx in the throat has set in
MIND AND THOUGHT
vibratory motion. It is certainly wonderful. Who could have
thought out such results, and then created the parts to make
them?
3. Out into the vastness of life, big events are maturing.
Thought is there. The thunder storm has its mission and obeys
a master call. The bolt of lightning awakened man to the uses
of electricity, and the beginning, big as it is, stands as a mere
trifle to the consequences ahead.
4. Thought crowds into everything. It is abundant,
superabundant, and overwhelmingly present. The marvel is
that so great a variety can exist; so many millions of ideas
can be crowded into one specimen of existence, without les­
sening the power that supplies this stream of thought. Mechan­
ical forces are everywhere at work obeying the commands of
universal thought; yet, on the other hand, subtle forces are
tearing down in order that the flow of ideas may build anew.
5. Within your mind there are agencies that will surprise
you when you come to know them. In your body, there are
millions of warriors fighting down the temple of your life;
and the very fact that you live depends on the momentary
crumbling of the particles that march to their place to shed
their life and march away to die that you may live. Life is
change. When change ceases, the light will fail forever.
6. Be thoughtful. Write the essays. Tear them up, and
write them over again on the same subjects, until you can no
longer improve them. Form the habit of finding evidences of
thought in everything. It will benefit your mind, and make
you great.
7. In what way will it make you great? You will touch
that vast flow of thought that is going on about you. Your
life thus far has been on the banks of a small brook of no con­
sequence. Come to the great stream that is bringing true exist­
ence down from the highlands. Get in touch with the sources
of power. In other words, let your thoughts from now on be
the thought that created you.
8. Every essay will make you more thoughtful, and
your mental character will grow. You will rise in stature, a
‘TAKING FORM” 3i
giant being. A new life and a grand inheritance will await you
even on this globe.
9. Form the habit of seeing evidences of thought not
nn1v in the things about, von. in the furniture, the walls, the
J O ........................ J " * * '
carpet, the clothes you wear, and all that is material; but also
seek proofs of the great source of thought in the events of
your daily life. They will come.
10. As we shall soon see, the physical stratum of exist­
ence is the battle ground of a never ceasing struggle to keep
alive. You are like the millions of your species when you
see in that struggle the only motive for living. Above it are
the uplands of true life, and to these we will come.
LESSON X
“TAKING FORM”
1. There was once a time when all space was void of
form. This is clearly proved by several lines of facts that
leave not the slightest doubt of the truth of the assertion. At
that time, thought filled the universe, and thought was without
form although all-powerful.
2. Eternity does not apply to form, but to thought.
The latter had no beginning. Form was created out of
thought, and the material that went into the making of form
was thought itself. For this reason, as stated in a preceding
lesson, all material is thought, and thought is both material
and non-material, because some thought has not taken form.
3. The one aim of the universe from the first step taken
in the creation, has been to make form; that is, to change
thought in part to form. In what way could this be done?
4. With a sky filled with thought which is a power un­
limited in every way, how could form be made? Naturally
we would suppose that thought would create the law of at­
traction by which concrete conditions would follow. There

4. T h e tw o hem ispheres o f the brain , in p ractically a ll
cases, are no better th an one hem isphere. T h e y are sep arated
b y a cleft. In the low er p a rt o f th is c le ft there is a b rid ge th a t

6. A child th at b egin s to use the rig h t hand w ill be le ft­

It m ust be rem em bered th at both h alves o f the b rain are a lik e ;
even w hen on e h olds the m in d an d the other is em pty. T h is
p roves that the m ind is n ot m ade b y the brain but b y hum an

A letter is a fo rm o f th o u g h t; a w o rd is a com bin ation ; and

1. T h e physical b rain is conceded to be the seat o f m ental

8. N e a rly all the so-called vicio u s habits o f life are form ed
b y the adoption o f the activities o f the first brain b y the second.
It m ust be rem em bered that repetition o f an y deliberate act is
su re to set in m otion the sam e act as a habit in the second brain.
I t is to relieve the first brain o f the w eariness o f consciousness
in the m ultitude o f w o r k to be p erfo rm ed d aily, that the second
b rain is fu rn ish ed b y n ature w ith the p o w er to take u p repeti­
tio n and c a rry it on b y itself. B u t this re lie f is d ou b le-b arreled ;
it saves the w ea r and tear o f constant consciousness, ye t it
establishes o th er habits, good as w ell as bad, that are carried
on au tom atically.
9. T h e g re a t ru le is to be ca re fu l o f e v e ry deliberate act.
In p ractice, take the tim e to be e x actly righ t, if yo u seek skill
and ease o f p ro g ress. M o st persons are p artly rig h t and go
ahead at h a p h a za rd ; thus fo rm in g either bad habits w ith the

m ittin g w eed s to en ter w ith the good s e e d ; an d the reap in g is

10. T h e m ost rem arkable p art o f the habits o f the second
b rain is the reten tion o f one set o f habits w hile others are being
form ed . T h u s, it w a s n ever easy fo r a m an to m ou n t and keep
his balance on th e old style h igh -w h eeled b ic y c le ; but w hen he
had once becom e e x p ert th ro u gh habit, and laid a w a y the
b icycle fo r yea rs, he fo u n d th at he could re-m ount w ith about
the sam e ease. T h e sam e la w holds tru e o f m ost things. O f
course th ere is loss o f fine skill in the non-use o f a n y habit.
V ic io u s hab its com e under the sam e rule. A set o f go o d habits

w a itin g fo r the tim e w hen th ey m a y reappear. W a tch fu ln ess

1. “ I R R I T A T I O N .” — T h e re are three g ro u p s o f ten
each, h a lf o f w h ich are n egative, and th e other h a lf are affirm ­
ative traits o f hum an life . T h e first is irritation . T h is is a con­
d ition that is au tom atic. It began in som e cause or excu se, and
w a s repeated until the an im al b rain took up the m ood and m ade
it a habit. E v e r y little th in g fre ts and irritates. In d ressin g, o r
in tu rn in g the le a f o f a book, in d rop p in g a button, h ittin g the
hand, o r alm ost e v e ry erratic act, the m uscles fly o ff under
supersen sitive n erves, and the m ind fum es. T h e re is a tendency
to th ro w th in gs, to sw ear, to slam about, to ejacu late an yth in g
that com es to the im pulsive thought, and even to g o to an
alm ost insane ra v in g o v e r the m erest trifles.
2 . “ S M O O T H N E S S .” — A s irritation is the first bad
trait o f th is g ro u p , so sm oothness is the first good t r a it; and is,
o f n ecessity, the opposite o f the fo rm er. W h a t the deliberate
m ind repeats a num ber o f tim es w ill becom e au tom atic and
create a habit. A s bad habits com e uninvited, th ey alw ays
hold s w a y unless a su p erior m ind is in control. T h a t irritab il­
ity is m erely an acq u ired habit m a y be seen fro m the fa c t that,
w hen som e person is at han d fo r w hom yo u hold a h ig h regard ,
y o u n ever a llo w y o u rs e lf to sh ow irrita b ility; y o u d o n ot then
sw ear, th ro w th in gs o r slam about. Y o u are sm ooth. Y o u
k n o w th is to be the case, fo r y o u h ave had the exact experience.
T h e re fo re , i f y o u can be sm ooth instead o f p ro jectin g porcu­

w h en alone. T h a t trait can be m ade an au tom atic habit.
3. “ E X C I T E M E N T .” — T h is is a trait that g ro w s w ith
the u sin g, an d it becom es less o r great in accord w ith yo u r
habits. It d iffe rs v e r y m u ch fro m irritab ility. E xcitem en t
arou ses y o u r th ou gh t. S om e rep ort sets y o u on fire. Y o u

b rou gh t to y o u r ears. Y o u build u p the m ob sp irit. Y o u are

trivial o r im portan t act sets yo u to th in k in g, an d y o u th in k

result o f lettin g y o u rse lf be arou sed u n d u ly into e x cite d th in k­
in g and action. P o ise is lackin g.
4. “ C A L M N E S S .” — T h e opposite o f excitem en t is
calm ness. In a ju d g e or a grea t person , it is called poise, or
the avoidan ce o f extrem es. A ju d g e can n o t a ffo rd to sh ow

should cu ltivate enthusiasm , and th is can be done in the v e ry
realm o f calm ness. T h e g ian t steam ship th at cro sses the ocean
is calm and m oves w ith superb d ig n ity ; b u t it is ch arged w ith
trem endous pow er. T h a t is better still. I t is a ll the creation
o f habit, one w a y o r the other.
5. “ A N G E R .” — T h is is the th ird o f the b ad traits in
the first grou p . A n g e r is a d isp la y o f u glin ess o r ag g ressiv e
h o stility to w ard som e person. It d iffe rs g re a tly fro m irrita ­
b ility ; fo r the latter is developed b y se lf-e rro rs, w h ile an ger
arises fro m the p a rty to w a rd w h o m it sh ow s its teeth. N o

being, or a n y anim al. T h e supposed cause is g en era lly sm all
o r lu d icro u s w hen view e d in the tru e lig h t. N e v e r be a n g ry .
6. “ P E A C E .” — T h is is a m ood th at m a y be cu ltivated
u n til it becom es a habit. S o m e person s g o th ro u g h life w ith
a ch ip on the sh o u ld er; oth ers cannot be tem pted ou t o f th eir

7. “ W O R R Y . ” — T h is is the com m on enem y o f health,

9. “ M E L A N C H O L Y .” — Som e person s believe this is
a m en tal disease. I f it is, then it has been in vited b y the habit­

brain. T h e d read ed disease, diabetes, has been caused b y

that w hen a suspicion is fo u n d ed on a fa c t th at arou ses it, th ere
is n oth in g that could p o ssib ly be rega rd ed as tran sferen ce o f

S o im portant a ru le is w o rth keep in g in m ind. T ru e it is
that fa cts and circum stances a re o fte n su spiciou s, b ut th ey a re

the discussion, fo r such suspicion s n ever lead to the assu m ption
o f th ou gh t tran sferen ce.
It is w hen the p erson sa ys aloud o r m en tally, “ I h ave a

erro r begins, unless it is c a re fu lly gu ard ed again st. T h e o n ly
sa fe course is to ask the q u estion : “ D o e s th is p resen tim en t or
something arise fro m an idea, a fa ct, a circu m stan ce that su g ­

th at no transm ission o f th o u gh t has occu rred .
A person is u n u su a lly pleasan t and d e fe re n tia l; yo u su s­

som e are sure it is p ro o f p ositive o f the existen ce o f the so u l;
oth ers believe it is p u rely an elastic edu cation fou n d ed on train ­

that the ch ild ren o f decent paren ts have touches o f conscience

O n e detective in th is co u n try stands pre-em inently above

th ey m u st be obtained fa irly , w ith o u t coercion or prom ise. It
is, th erefo re, n ecessary th at th ey appear to be v o lu n ta ry state­

T h e re are tw o sides to the experience. T h e first is that

In the case o f a m an suspected and held under a rrest fo r

A L L D E A T H w h at y o u m ay, it ends all, o r opens

p artu re o f co n scio u sn e ss; the escape o f an essence o f
v ita lity , coheren t or dissolved. I f death is the b egin n in g o f a
life to com e, it is the a g en cy b y w h ich the soul, and perhaps the
consciousness, passes on, a fte r leavin g the body, as a shell or
w re c k is laid b y fo r n ew ten an cy in a better abode.
In either case, a sin gle q uestion is eq u ally applicable; A r e

T h e in q u iry m a y seem useless, but it serves an im portan t
purpose. In the first place, a m a jo rity o f all p reviou s gen era­

three d ays, b ein g unable to disen tan gle itself fro m the flesh.
T h is is the basis o f C h ristia n ity ; but m ore, it is com m on to
oth er religion s. It is p revalen t am on g m ost o f the savage and
all o f the civ ilized trib es an d nations. In add ition to its position
in the b eliefs o f m an kin d , it is verified b y person al incidents in

yet it is not dead. I f m an lives w h en the b reath departs fro m

fa c u lty that is predom in an t in all th o u gh t tran sferen ce, both in

O u r n e x t position is fre e fro m difficulty in part. I f the

It m ay be fu lly d e v e lo p e d ; fo r then it is crystal c le a r ; b u t

a ru n n in g series o f even ts connected into a story, so as to appeal
to the cu riosity, then read in g is n ot a m eans o f train in g the
m ind.
It is possible to su ggest m an y w a ys o f d evelop in g habits
o f a ctio n ; an d a m o n g them the fo llo w in g are o f ch ief valu e:
1. Thinking in reading. T h is consists o f tw o steps:
F irs t, read in g a sentence, then closin g the book, and repeating
alou d the ideas, n ot the la n g u a g e ; second, read in g a sentence
an d rep eatin g m en tally, as though aloud, the ideas, n ot the
lan gu age. T h is little b it o f practice is v e ry difficult at first, but
soon aw aken s the habit o f q u ick ly catching the th ou gh t, and
often m ore than the thought. It is close to the sub-conscious
faculty, as m ay be d iscovered b y a v e ry lim ited num ber o f
trials, if the su ggestio n s o f the fo u r precedin g chapters have
been adopted. A la rg er va ria tio n consists o f read in g a w hole
page, sh u ttin g the b ook and recallin g as m an y o f the ideas as
possible. T h e d ifferen ce betw een th is and m em o rizin g is that
the latter recalls the w ord s, an d this the ideas.
2. Reading between the lines. H o w e v er the phrase m ay
be taken, the intended use o f it here is th is: W h a t prom pted the
th o u g h t? T a k e as an exam p le the fo llo w in g lin es:
“ B reathes there a man w ith soul so dead
W h o never to him self hath said,
T h is is m y ow n , m y native land.”
I f w e read betw een the lines, w e an alyze as fo llo w s: W h y did
the poet use the w o rd breathes? C ou ld not som e other w ord
be as w ell ap p lied ? B y man does he intend to exclu d e w o m an ?
H o w can the soul be dead, I f dead, h ow can it be deader, or
so dead ? D oes soul m ean som ethin g else? Is it a v irtu e to
talk to on e’s s e lf? Is on e’s n ative land so m u ch a su b ject o f
p rid e ?
T a k e one hu n d red illu stration s o f this practice, read ve ry
e x h a u stiv e ly and c ritica lly b etw een the lines, and yo u w ill find
HABITS OF ACTION 2 9 1
all stu d y-read in g, that is all ca re fu l read in g, p u ttin g on a n ew
interest. T h en com es in to p la y the g rea t la w o f reaction . Y o u r
p rob in g o f the th o u g h ts o f a g rea t o rig in a to r w ill th ro w y o u r
m ind into som ethin g o f the sam e state o f th ou gh t an d fe e lin g
that prom pted the o rig in o f the lines: an d thus y o u are closer
still to the sub-conscious condition.
3. Speedy thinking. T h is is a repetition o f the tw o
preced in g su ggestion s, in w h ich each exercise is repeated a
num ber o f tim es w ith m ore readin ess than b efo re, u n til the
results m ay be obtain ed w ith considerable speed.
4. Stimulating the mind. T h e m ost h ea lth fu l operation
o f w h ich the b rain is capable is the stim u latin g process. It is
but a h u rry in g o f o n e’s th o u g h t; b egin n in g at the outset o f
the sentence an d ru sh in g m en tally th ro u g h to the end o f the
intended thought, an ticip atin g the w o rd s som e d istan ce in a d ­
vance. It is the secret o f cau tiou s con versation , fo r it enables
the talker to see clear th ro u g h to the end o f the sentence, e v e r y ­
th in g to be u ttered ; to k n o w , as it w ere, h o w it w ill sound.
It is the secret o f spon tan eous or extem p o re sp eakin g, fo r it
supplies the orator w ith the fu ll th o u gh t and ideas in ad van ce
o f utterance, and a rra n g es them fo r his d iscretio n a ry use. T h e
exact nature o f this p ractice is n ot easily m ade c le a r ; but, once
understood, is read ily adopted. M en and w om en o f clear ju d g ­
m ent m ake use o f it alm ost in stin ctively. S u ccess com es soon er
to the clear, ca re fu l sp eaker and thinker. T h e p ractice is sim p ly
this: W h en yo u are b egin n in g a sentence, w ritten or spoken ,
stop in the e a rly p a rt o f it, and u tter alou d the ideas o r w o rd s
clear th ro u gh to the end. W h e n yo u can do th is easily, w h ich
w ill require som e tim e in certain cases, then confine the p ractice
to sim ilar w ork, but silently. T h e th ird step is to adopt th is
habit o f action at all tim es, as a p art o f y o u r life.
5. The acquisition of ideas. T h is is a p a rt o f the u n i­
versal education o f life , fo r it is the one sole cause o f the u n ­
fo ld in g o f the b rain an d d evelop in g the m ind. T h e in telligen t
child indulges in it, an d g ro w s to k n o w m ore o f the w o rld than
m an y others o f less m en tal a ctiv ity . It m ust h a ve been the

N O T H E R m ethod o f d evelop in g the clearness o f the

to w ard the sub-con scious fa cu lty, is that w hich ran ­
sacks the brain , h u n tin g fo r th ou gh ts that have been

resu ltin g in th ou gh t are relegated to, and becom e a part o f, the
sub-con scious m ind. T h e stu d y o f this operation is decidedly
in terestin g.
V ic to r H u g o , a lo n g w ith thousands o f others, believed
th at he had lived on earth b efo re. “ M y inner m ind tells me

th is life , co m in g to us in th ou gh ts, are laid a w a y in the inner

m ind.
T h e stu d y an d p ractice o f th is chapter have been objected

w hile, and at len gth reaches into realm s o f a m a zin g fru ita g e .
It can s a fe ly be said there is n o stu d y an d n o practice so fa s ­
cin atin g as this.
W h a t is it? It is d ivid ed into sev era l stages:
F irs t, resto rin g lost th ou gh ts o f the im m ediate present.
Secon d , resto rin g lost th ou gh ts o f th e im m ed iate past.
T h ird , restorin g lost th ou gh ts o f the rem ote past.
F o u rth , g ro p in g into the haze o f fa r a w a y tim e.
A num ber o f students and exp erim en ters h ave fo llo w ed
out these steps, even g o in g into the fo u rth an d m ost d ifficu lt;
but fo r the purposes o f this stu d y, as fa r as the present volu m e
is concerned, the first step is sufficient. It serves tw o e n d s; it
starts the m ental im pulse n ecessary fo r the oth er step s; it en ­
ables the pupil to train the m ind to a clearn ess and acuteness
required fo r the stu d y o f th ou gh t tran sferen ce. In eith er case
it is clo sely allied to the sub-con scious fa c u lt y ; it is even a p a rt
o f that pow er.
W e w ill th erefo re con sider the first step o n ly — resto rin g
lost th ou gh ts o f the im m ediate present. A lost th o u gh t is an
im pression or an idea laid a w a y and fo r g o tte n ; it is not lo st in

Law 3. True thought transference is spontaneous.
I t travels w ith a speed th at is in con ceivab le, an d m u st

that person among all mankind.

T o conduce is to lead to w a r d ; to con tribu te is to b rin g to or i n ;

T h is has been p re v io u sly stated in va rio u s fo rm s. I t is

Law 32. Thought transference is known to occur only
when the conscious mind recognizes the action of the sub­

Law 40. The mind may receive a thought from a mind
unconscious of receiving it.
T h is need not ap p ly to the resu rrectio n o f a past even t,

Law 41. If the sub-conscious mind can be traced to
savages and brutes, then thought transference is the remnant
of a power grown stunted through disuse.
T h is w ill be con sidered in connection w ith the n ext rule.
Law 42. If the sub-conscious mind does not belong to
savages and brutes, then thought transference is the germ of a

In discu ssin g these tw o la w s w e start w ith the fa c t that

w h y th ey should n ot be, as the o p p o rtu n ity is open to all p e r­

o f th o u gh t tran sferen ce the best m ethod is b y questions and

the teach er to co v er the an sw er, as g iv en in this book, w ith a

done in th is w a y : T o first p u p il as class is arran ged , “ W h a t is

METHODS TO AVOID
A ll m orb id o r abn orm al m odes o f exp erim en t sh ou ld be
shu n n ed ; even w h en su ccessfu l, th eir results are m erely rep eti­
tions o f w h at has been established o ve r an d o ver again . S cien ce
needs n o fu rth er p ro o f in cu m u lative testim on y. A m o n g th ese
abn orm alism s, are the fo llo w in g :
1. Mesmerism, or hypnotism. A v o id it. A v o id u sin g
it o n others, fo r y o u sim p ly w aste y o u r tim e, an d in ju re them .
A v o id b ein g m esm erized, fo r th e g rea test end accom plished is
m erely p u ttin g to sleep the con sciou s m in d w hile a w ak en in g
the sub-conscious, a one-sided resu lt th at is lost on y o u r o w n
intelligence. Y o u a re the tool an d m icroscop e o f another.
2. Clairvoyance. D o n o t becom e, an d do n o t em p loy,
a clairvoyan t. T h e p o w e r o f “ clear seein g” is d ecid ed ly on e­
sided, and gen erally w o rse th an useless.
3. Muscle reading. T h is is an attem pt, b y ta k in g hold
o f the hand o r to u ch in g som e p a rt o f the b od y o f an other p e r­
son, to catch the w a v es o f th ou gh t, as o f som e sin gle idea fix ed
in advance. T h is h as been done m a n y tim es, but is o f little
consequence, even i f h ig h ly su ccessfu l. T h e th o u g h t is n ever
cau gh t as an original m en tal action , an d it is ex trem ely difficult
fo r a com m on m ind to propel a “ secon d -h an d ” th o u g h t w ith th e
fo rce o f one th at is origin al. T h e v e r y fa c t th at the attem p t
is b ein g m ade to catch the th o u gh ts th ro u g h the m uscles is in
itself sufficient to d istract b oth m in ds an d in te rfere w ith th e
transm ission. T ru e telep ath y is spontaneous, an d should be
propelled, received an d reco gn ized fre e ly .
4. Mind reading. T h is is an attem pt to d isco ver w h a t is
in an oth er’s m ind, in e x a c t lan gu age o r fix ed ideas. It is o fte n
used as a test o f on e’s skill at such r e a d in g ; w h en the fa c t is
that a n y trial o f this kin d prod u ces d istractio n o f th o u g h t in
the th in ker, and con cen tration o f con sciou s atten tion in the
re a d e r; either o f w h ich w ill d efeat the effo rt. “ W h a t am I

T h e p osition is a b s u rd ; fo r the person is th in k in g o f som e spe­

also o f the success o r failu re o f the read er; the m ix tu re being
as b ad as a m u d m in d ; an d n o clear single th ou gh t possible,

tem pt in vo lves in d u ced effo rts, w h ich are n ever one-tenth as

5. Object reading. T h is is closely allied to m orbid
telepathy. It con sists o f test tria ls to learn i f one person is able
to tell som e card , figu re, letter o r o b ject kn ow n but concealed
b y an other.
6. Induced transmissions. E x c e p t as ad vised in the pres­
en t volum e, it is n o t ad van tageo u s to practice in the line o f
induction, ch iefly fo r the reason th at it is p la y ; w hile the

is the spon tan eou s tran sm ission .

>H E S T A T E M E N T S set fo rth in this chapter are but
a collective reiteratio n o f w h at has been repeatedly
su ggested in the p reced in g pages o f the present vo l-

the w ritin g o f the book, to p ro ve th at w h at has been regard ed
b y the gen eral m ass o f people as a g ift o r excep tion al use o f

In re-statin g this p ro p o sitio n fo r the last tim e, w e propose to

In the first place, m an has not yet d iscovered all things.

T h e scientific kn ow led ge o f telep ath y is less than tw e n ty y e a rs

In the second place, the su b-con sciou s fa c u lty exists. T h is
m uch is kn ow n. Its existen ce is n ot lim ited to a special class,
but is alm ost u n iversal a m o n g th ose w h o possess stren gth and
e n erg y o f brain stru ctu re.
In the th ird place, th is fa c u lty resem bles all other p o w e rs
in nature in th at it has its uses an d its u selessn ess; or, in other
w ord s, its flow ers an d w eeds. S tea m ru n n in g w ild is a n u is­

the art o f th ou gh t tran sferen ce, the flo w ers an d the w eeds are
con stan tly fo u n d ; w e call all m orb id and abn orm al exh ib itio n s
the w e e d s ; w e call gen iu s and clear perception the flow ers.
In the fo u rth place, the m in d is all con tain in g. Its d evel­
opm ent is one con tin u ou s w on d er. C o n sistin g o f tw o g re a t

and all the scope o f m en tal tran sactio n s as fa r as o u r relations

discovered, but none the less real. B o th are p arts o f one m in d ;
and both serve their special uses. P erh ap s, like th e n ew w o rld ,

g ro w th cam e v e ry ap p ro p riately to hand. It w a s in th e fitness
o f th in gs that, at su ch a tim e, A m e ric a sh ou ld be d iscovered.
S o it m ay be said that the m ind, replete w ith its in ven tion s, has

T h e inborn ye a rn in g a fte r im m o rtality finds in gress here. T h e
in sp iration o f gen iu s, the d ream s o f art, philosophy and in ven ­

velop ed an d m atu red in the sub-con scious m ind.
In the fifth place, the ab n orm al appearance o f telepathy is
in the con dition o f the b od y rath er than o f the m ind. T h is d is­
tin ctio n is o f im portance an d shou ld be ca re fu lly considered.
I t h as been said o f A le x a n d e r the G reat, o f Julius Caesar, o f
N ap o leo n and others, th at th ey w ere subject to attacks o f cata­

b o d y o fte n closes ou t the con sciousn ess o f the gen eral m ind and
leaves the sub-con scious fa c u lty aw ake, the result b ein g that
the latter has fu ll sw a y fo r the tim e being. A sim ilar condition
is fo u n d in clairvo yan ce, m esm erism an d m ind read in g, the
con d ition b ein g abn orm al as fa r as the b od y is concerned, but
th is abn orm alism sim ply closes ou t the conscious m ind and
opens the sub-conscious. T h e fa cu lty revealed is n ever show n
to be m orbid. T h e m ost th at can be ch arged again st it is that
th is fa cu lty b reaks th ro u g h the ch in ks o f a w eakened b o d y or,
m o re p ro p e rly speakin g, an exh au sted n ervou s system . I f a
b a g con tain ed p reciou s gem s, an d b y its stren gth effectu ally

It is a w ell k n o w n fa c t th at like p rod u ces like in the
brain . T h is o rg a n m a y be said to have three d istin ct fu n ction s:
1. Its w a k in g fu n ction s, a s it is o rd in a rily fou n d w hen
w e are n ot asleep.
2. Its sleepin g fu n ction , w hich includes both sound sleep
an d th e dream state.
3. T h e in spiration al fu n ctio n w h ich m akes gen iu s possible.
The more we think of the events which are closely allied
to the waking functions of the brain, the less apt we are to
pass into the other functions, and especially the sleeping condi­
tion. If we can grasp and secure any operation of the brain
which accompanies the sleeping function, we can invite sleep.
F o r th is reason w e can cause the brain to sleep b y re vie w in g
th e incidents o f the dream . T h e ab ility to produce sleep by
th is m eans has been so th o ro u g h ly tested and proven b y the
testim o n y o f innum erable people, that it is n o w accepted b y
scien tists as a settled fact. B u t even to do this it is n ecessary
fo r the p erson , im m ed iately upon a w a k in g fro m the dream ,
to w rite d o w n the incidents o f that dream , fillin g in all the
d etails th a t the m in d can recall. I f w e w a it, even a fe w
m in u tes a fte r a w a k in g , w e w ill find that the incidents becom e
b lurred , the b rain is clo sin g on its sleeping con dition and com ­
m en cin g a sep arate life. B u t the su rp risin g fa c t is this:
If immediately upon awaking, we write down the incidents
of the dreamand commit them to memory, whenever the mem­
ory recalls them, the mind seeks to go back to that condition
which created them. S o if, at n igh t w hen w e find it difficult
to obtain sleep, w e th in k these incidents o v e r again , and fix
the m in d u p on them , it w ill soon travel in to its sleeping
fu n ction .
L e t us take a lesson fro m this g rea t fact, and in th is w a y :
W h e n e v e r a th o u gh t o f u n u su al value occu rs to the m ind,
