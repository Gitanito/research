Charles Melbourne Hope (Lord Hope) was born in Ararat, Victoria in Australia. His father, John Hope, the 1st Marquis of Linlithgow, was a colonial governor. &nbsp;Hope was educated at Eton College and served in the army from 1911.  Psychical Research

Hope joined the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in 1926 and served on its governing council between 1931 and 1955. He was a generous supporter of the organization, in terms both of time and financial donations. In 1931 he was invited by the London Spiritual Alliance to become a member of its research branch, the London Psychical Laboratory.

Sittings with the American medium George Valiantine1 in 1927 left him disappointed at the lack of evidence of postmortem survival, and uncertain even whether Valiantine was genuine.2 Other activities included a a visit to Brook House, Frimley, the site of an alleged haunting, in 1949,3 and the acquisition of molds of the ‘Walter’ thumbprints from the Margery séances in the late 1920s.4  Rudi Schneider

Hope collaborated with Eugene Osty’s investigation of the Austrian medium Rudi Schneider in Paris between 1930 and 1931. The following year he conducted his own experiments with Schneider in London, publishing his findings in the SPR Proceedings5 along with similar reports by other investigators. Here he drew attention to apparatus used and precautions against fraud; he also had audio recordings made of Schneider’s peculiar breathing while in a trance.6 He contested claims by Harry Price that Schneider fraudulently used a free hand to stage phenomena, arguing that this only damaged Price’s reputation.7 &nbsp;He later published his recollections of his involvement with Schneider,8 maintaining that under sympathetic conditions Schneider was able to produce ‘impressive phenomena’ and adding that Schneider’s belief in his ‘unusual’ powers was ‘quite genuine’.  Borley Rectory

Hope made two visits to Borley Rectory, the location of an alleged haunting, in 1929. His extensive notes (housed in Cambridge University Library) were quoted frequently in a critical survey published later by Dingwall, Goldney and Hall.9 &nbsp;In comments made to Harry Price, who led the investigation, Hope said ‘I was not impressed and thought the phenomena were produced by normal means’.10  Selected Articles
