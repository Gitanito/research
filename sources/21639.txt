PREFACE
T
HAT the island of Britain was the seat of
the development of a cultus and secret
tradition of extraordinary vitality and individ-
tt.dity is no new thesis, but, so far, it is one which
has not been dealt with in any tolerable or scientific
111anner, nor has the evidence concerning it been
•·xamined in the light of modern research, especially
.1s regards recent valuable conclusions in Folklore
;111d Archceology. AU I can claim to have done in
1he present volume is to have collected the data
mncerning it and to have made an effort to system-
alize the same, with the dual intention of proving
ils authentic character and value to British mystics
as providing them with a horizon of native and,
therefore, sympathetic lore and practice ; and its long
survival in these islands-a survival which, in certain
Jistricts, appears to have lasted until a time which
we are now accustomed to regard as comparatively
recent.
That the cult we call '' Druidism '' possessed a
much higher mystical tendency than the generality
of British people are aware has, of course, been
frequently advanced as a serious contention. But,
because of the bizarre method by which this view has
formerly been advanced, a perfectly sound hypothesis
has not only been seriously damaged, but has been
greeted with unmerited contempt. I have striven,
in setting it forth in a more catholic manner, to
employ only such sources as appeared to me
s
6 Preface
absolutely worthy of credence and to eschew anything
in the nature of the extreme or the empirical- in
short, to let the evidence plead for the theory by
virtue of its copiousness, its obviousness, and its
generally overwhelming character. At the same
time, 1 ha,·e made every ende.:wour to arrange and
select this in such a manner that the orderly
presentation of f::lcts would not in any way derogate
from their weight or possible acceptance, and to digest
them into the beginnings of a system which will at
least give pause to those who altogether deny the
former presence of a highly intellectualized wltus
and mystery in our islands, or its survival in a more
or less official form until recent tim<"s.
The nucleus of proof is, naturally, to be sought
in \Vales, the last stronghold of official Druidism,
where a quite extraordinary treasure of manuscript
material relating to it !'.till exists. It has been far
too much the fashion to assume a problematical or
comparatively recent origin for ancient Cambrian
literary sources. But 1 believe l have brought
sufficient evidence to bear to show conrlusivdy that
this great corpus of venerable material is not only
authentic in essence, but of such preponderating
value as it is scarcely pnssihle to nv('restim:lte.
E specially do 1 believe the writings preserved by
folo 1\lorganwg in Barddas to have been handed
down from an immemorial antiquity, as his C'ditors
maintained, and to enshrine the beliefs, ideas, and
praclices of the Secret Tradition of Dritain, and I
feel that the unbiassed reader will , afLCr having
perused the evidence relative to this, find himself in
genc~al agreement with this view.
The evidence concerning the ril<'.S ;llld c<'remonies
of initiation is, I think, clear and conclusive, and
should once for all lay at rest any dubiety on this
Preface 7
particular head. It should also be of peculiar value
In British mystics, as providing them with a general
view of a system or code of conduct by which their
.ancestors sought to gain a knowledge of that higher
c·xistence which they personally seek to attain, and
I am not without hope that it may induce them to
mnsider the propriety of examining further, and
1wrhaps embracing a soul-philosophy more in natural
mnformity with our native psychology than any
~·xmic system can possibly be.
We Britons are, alas, too prone to find in alien
systems, resthetic and philosophic, that which is
seemingly more desirable than anything of native
ongm. So far as mystical philosophy is concerned,
we have not until the present, perhaps, had any real
npportunity of gauging the values of a tradition
developed in accordance with Western: and more
t·xclusively Britannic, mentality. But I feel that
with the mass of fact I have been enabled to place
lldore him, the British mystic may no longer believe
himself compelled to seek guidance from Oriental
t·uhs and philosophies of arcane origin, but may
turn for the purposes of psychical instruction and
<>nlightenment to the noble and venerable tradition of
his fathers, in which he cannot but discover ideals
and beliefs which strike a familiar and hereditary
chord, to his refreshment, encouragement, and final
illumination. I have also carefully indicated the
sources fwm which he may gain a more comprehen-
sive knowledge of the system in its entirety.
l cannot close without expressing my sincere
1hanks to Miss Wendy Wood for the eight excellent
drawings which she has made for this book.
Deeply imbued with the Keltic spirit and versed in
the details of Keltic antiquity, she has also infused
them with the richness of Keltic imagination and
8 Pre face
mysltetsm. I have also to thank my daughter Rhoda
ror tireless assistance in gathering and arranging the
materials which are the foundations of this attempt
w rebuild the house of our decaying British tradition
-an edifice which, I am convinced, the patriotic
mystic will lend every aid in gloriously rebuilding !

'rhe Mysteries of Britain
CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY
I n 1he peoples of antiquity the isle of Britain was
IfII' vc:ry home and environment of mystery, a sacred
,, 11 irory, to enter which was to encroach upon a
"· :in11 of enchantment, the dwelling of gods, the
luuw ~nd habitation of a cult of peculiar sanctity and
Ill\ .1 in1l power. Britain was , indeed, the inmla
'" 111 of the \Vest, an island veiled and esoteric, the
I· L
' \ pl of the Occident. Legends of its strange and
111 tilnus marvels were current among the semi-
tt vthzed races who dwelt over against its ghostly
\dut c cliffs ; it was regarded as the haunt and refuge
•o1 giants, demons, and spirits ; by not a few, even as
tlw paradise and resort of the dead. The early
11 l'nunrs of its terrors show how varied were the
\\ rulders ascribed to it. Perhaps that instinct or
I" oli<·y of secrecy which inspired early traders to
'"' mund an area of mercantile monopoly with tales of
·l11·ad was responsible for much of this supernatural
'''lllltation. But the fame of Britain as a territory
wtthdrawn and occult cannot altogether be explained
I•Ysuch a theory.
The intention o£ this book is to explain the ancient
·.l:ttus of Britain as a country of almost unique
·..ml'tity in the ancient world, and to demonstrate the
•.11rvival of the mysticism and occult tradition which
17
B
18 T h e 1\l yste ries of Britain
were certainly developed .uno11g our flri ti~h at~ce~Lf\rs
tf\ an extent unrivalled on the cominent of Europe.
I !>hall also endeavour to make it plain, by arguments
founded upon authority, that the tradition of
tn) sticism which flourished in our island was of equal
antiquity and sanction with that developed in Egypt
and lhe East, and in no sense derivative from it so
far as ilS origins were concerned.
The romance of distance has, indeed, played havoc
with our native occult philosophy. Either because
the Ea!>l appears to u<> more glamorous than our
own environment, or because we have become
conventionally used lo the notion, we assume that
she is the mother of all mystery, that her ancient
civilizations-Egypt, Babylonia, anrl Tndia- wf'r!'
the sole and world-originators of secret lore. Yct it
is demonstrable that on our insular and isolated soil
there arose an arcane tradition as potent and as
majestic as any similar system fostered by the
Orient, and better accommodated to our racial
psychology.
Although it is impossible to dogmatize concerning
the origins and earlier affinities of this separate
British tradition, we can affirm with confidence that
through long and insular segregation it developed
a system entirely its own, which was handed down
through the ages and is still capable of extensive
recovery. J ust as in the early centuries of our era,
and before them, Britain was 1eganled as specifically
sacred, an enclosure o£ the gods, so throughout the
Age of Romance was she thought of as peculiarly
the island of faerie glamour and enchanted adventure.
This secondary phase was merely n survival of the
muc-h more venerable belief in her relig1ous sanctity.

refers to a late form of the belief in the mysterious
reputation of Britain in his De B ello Gotltico.•
Speaking of the Isle of Brittia, by which he means
Britain, he states that it is divided by a wall.
Thither fishermen from the Breton coast are
compelled to ferry over at darkest night the shades
of the dead, unseen by them, but marshalled by a
mysterious leader. The fishermen who are to row
the dead across to the British coast must go to bed
early, for at midnight they are aroused by a tapping
at the door, and someone calls them in a low voice.
They rise and go down to the shore, attracted by
some force which they cannot explain. Here they
find their boats apparently empty, yet the water
rises to the bulwarks, as if they were crowded.
Once they commence the voyage, their vessels
cleave the waves speedily, making the passage,
usually a day and a half's sailing, in an hour. When
the British shore is reached, the souls of the dead
leave the craft, which at once rise in the sea as if
unloaded. Then a loud voice on shore is heard
calling the name and style of those who have
disembarked. How hard Keltic lore dies is
illustrated by the fact that it is still ustu'll at Treguier
in Brittany to convey the dead to the churchyard in
a boat over a part of the river called the " Passage
de I'Enfer," instead of taking the shorter way by
land.•
As has already been said, the argument to be
upheld in these pages is that Eum pean civilization,
both Eastern and Western , arose from a common
centre. It follows from this that the religious and
mystical ideas which flowed from that common fount
had also a single and primitive origin. J ust as the

1• lt.tl •le evidence that it similarly developed in

"'' "' and evolving an occult tradition of equal

\V ith this theory are indissolubly associated those

Nile-land than elsewhere, that was almost wholly on
account of the propitious environment it encountered
there. Similarly it took on special attributes in
Britain, the Cult of the Dead which it carried with it
to our island, as it did to Egypt, culminating in the
sublime and intellectual system of Druidism, whjch
found here its natural home and environment, which
survived in Britain long after it had perished else-
where, and lingered on, affecting the entire process
and history of llritish mystical thought even to the
present time.
In order Lo justify the above statements a
digression into the sphere of archceology and
ethnology is essential. This will draw its facts and
sustain its arguments from the writings of authorities
who have given the most recent attention to the
problems of European archceology and those of the
Near East. In Europe, the history of civilization
may be said to begin with the Aurignacian or Cro-
l\Iagnon race, who appear to have entered our
continent about 23000 o.c. Certain authorities
believe them to have had an African origin. The
Capsians, who followed them, roughly about 10000
B.C., were admittedly of 1\frican origin, and their
culture was superior to that of their predecessors, in
the domestication of the dog and the usc of the bow.
Like the Aurignacians, the Capsians were artists
who left their paintings on the walls of their rock-
shelters in the central parts o[ Spain, only these
display a much more marked conventional treatment
of the subject and were nearly all of a religious or
magical character.

cultures whose remains are found on British soil, but
even in some cases to the actual localities and
identical sites in Spain, in Gaul, and elsewhere
whence they must have been carried to our shores
some twenty to forty centuries ago. At first,
conservative antiquaries were chary of giving assent
to conclusions so novel and far-reaching in their
consequences to British prehistory. But the
evidence has been so overwhelming in its character
and so universal in its acceptance as to justify
complete agreement with its deductions.
These most surprising results have been arrived
at chiefly through painstaking comparison between
British and Continental megalithic or rough stone
forms of architecture, pottery, and artifacts in stone
and bronze, and by the rise of a wonderful European
journalism of antiquity hitherto unapproached in
accuracy, perception, and distinction. The remark-
able conclusions alluded to are to a great extent due
to the excellent pioneer work Accomplished in Spain
by Senors Obermeier and Bosch Gimpera, and in
Great Britain by Messrs 0. G. S. Crawford, E. H.
Stone, and Professor V. Gordon Childe.
Concentration on the question of the trade-routes
blazed by the ancient peoples of the Mediterranean
and Atlantic areas during the Iew Stone and Bronze
Ages has, indeed, revolutionized our comprehension
of the Western World four thousand years ago, and
has made it clear that the traders of Spain and
Brittany even at that dim era regularly engaged in a
continuous and well-organized commerce with our
islands. Not only did they carry with them such
:lrticles of merchandise as they could barter for gold ,
amber , and jet, but they instructed our rude fore-
fathers in their own system of rough stone building

The long barrows were used ac; collecLivC' sepulchres
in which the dead were usually burieu, although in
Yorkshire and some parts of Scotland undoubted
evidences of cremation are forthcoming.
The men who constructed these long barrows were
long-skulled and short in stature. That they came
by sea and from the South-West is certain, as the
distribution of their burial-places reveals, and the
barrows they built can be referred only to similar
structures in Spain and the \Nestern Mediterranean,
especially in Almeria.
These long barrow men were traders, voyaging
from Spain to Denmark by way of the northern
coasts of Scotland, as the series of these tombs shows,
and the Danish amber and Britic;h jet found in their
Spanish burial-places are eloquC'nt of the far-Aung
traffic in which they engaged. But few signs are
evident of any colonization on a large scale by this
enterprising race of maritime merchants, which may
be dated at about 20<Xl a.c., and is contemporary
with the Middle Minoan civilization in Crete. But
the long barrow culture did not impinge on our
eastern coasts, or, indeed, press far inland, although
it seems improbable that it may have been "taken
over by the natives from traders touching on the
shore," as Professor Childe suggests. Surely had
such been the case such precise similarity to Iberian
models as he alludes to could scarcely have resulted.
The lives of the builders of the long barrows were
evidently almost entirely conditioned by lhe Cult of
the Dead. That these New Stnne .1\gc people were
originally of African origin is now clear.• In Spain,
extraordinary numbers of religious objects associated
with this cult have been found, made chiefly from
bone, idols of a Aat or "plaque" shape, and

tiiii'C!clucing a metc'll culture into the island for the
ltr·'l time, manufacturing gold objects on a fairly large
,,,,Jr, and a peculiar shape of food-vessel with a
lwll-shaped mouth. Their contribution to Br-itish
1 11h 11re was certainly greater than that of their
\ tlantic predecessors. But the cultures overlapped
''"' mixed. And there is sufficient evidence that the
tdi~rious and mystical ideas of the earlier Iberian
I~~'"Pies triumphed, completely dominating in the
1 11d Lhose of the Central European new-comers, and
~·tving for all time a peculiarly " Iberian" aspect to
lit itish religious and mystical thought. Britain was,
1111 lt-cJ, destined to remain Iberian in a religious
•.c·nsc long after the Iberian Cult of the Dead had
LLnished in its own original milieu. Once introduced,
28 T he M y s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
this 1berian form appears to have taken a powerful
hold on the imagination of the native stock and its
successors, and even the later Celtic invaders seem
to have adapted its basic principles and to have
grafted their mythology upon it. This then it was
which rendered British mystical thought unique in
Europe, and which caused it to be looked upon by
the peoples of the Continent at the beginning of the
Christian era as the exemplar and prototype of the
ancient faith of the West.
Controversy rages on the question of the priority
of civilization in East and W est. Those who
maintain the more venerable character of Eastern
civilization regard the Iberian culture of Spain as a
reflection of that of the Eastern Mediterranean. or,
at least, a carrier of its benefits to more northern
lands. But the bare fact that the megalithic or
rough stone monuments of Spain exhibit exactly
similar, if more conventionalized, paintings to those
of the more ancient Capsian culture which came from
North-West Africa, should give the protagonists of
Eastern civilization considerable pause. It is
precisely the great centres of megalithic architecture
in Europe which have obviously the closest affiliation
with survivals from the Old Stone Age of the West,
an age pre-dating anything that the Nile and
Mesopotamia have to show.
Even the Old Stone Age in Spain and France was
not only demonstrably native to the West and more
ancient than the cultures of the East, but it assuredly
exhibits the earliest known germs of the great Cult
of the Dead. Late Aurignacian burials display the
lirst steps in the development o[ mummification at a
periud at least qooo years B.c. '1he tlcsh was
removed from the bones and these were painted red,

natives into the art of metal-working, while
instructing them in the art of dolmen-building (that
is, according to S mith and Perry, mastaba-building)
will scarcely recommend itself as being well founded
or reasonable. vVhy the "prospectors" should have
taught the rude populations of Spain and Brittany
the rudiments of their religion and the art of
imitating the mastaba and yet have refused them the
boon of instruction in ore-working, is not sufficiently
made plain. There is no real reason to believe that
the dolmen was not lhe invention of the late survivors
of the Old Stone Age civilization of the Atlantic or
Western region. "The great centres of megalithic
architecture in Europe are precisely those regions
where the Old Stone Age survivals are most
numerous," remarks Professor Childe. He goes on
to remark that this thesis, too, has its difftculties.
" How did megalithic architecture spread from the
Atlantic Coast to the Caucasus, to say nothing of
India or the Pacific Islands? Tf Lhe comparison
drawn (in a preceding chapter) between the early
civilizations of the Near East and the West has any
weight, it would be absurd to argue that the Western
barbarians taught the Egyptians and Cretans the
Cult of the Dead. "
So it would certainly appear to one who was not
armed with a third and alternative theory-the thesis
that both West and East drew the idea of the Cult
of the Dead from a common source, a North African
source. My own belief is that this great and ancient
cult, dating from the late Palceolithic times, spread
from some centre in North-West Africa to Egypt
on the one hand, and to Spain, Gaul, and eventually
to Britain on the other. Thrtt it had already begun
to develop in Spain in late Aurignacian times we have
seen, and that it invaded Britain through "Spanish"
In t r o du cto r y 31
udltu n('C' about 2000 B.C. • and E gvpl about the
ht .t Dynasty, is also clear. My contention is that
11 ",,., this very ancient cult which brought to Britain
dw ··lcments of that faith which later took shape as
I h wdism, a religion which came to have an especial

utd,Td , the root and beginning of British mysticism.
1\ett.tin , we know from Cresar, was regarded as the
11llu tal home of Druidism. Let us see precisely what
r 'ulrnce we possess of the North-vVest African
••••gin of the Cult of the Dead.
lummification, the preservation of the human
I"Hiy after death in order that it might once more be
'1vivified by the return of the spirit, seems to have
.....,.n in Egypt out of the Cult of Osiris, god of the
•J, .ul and the Underworld. Osiris does not make his
'l'l"·.u·ance in Egypt bdorc the period o[ the First
llvnasty, or about 3400 n.c ., when a centre of his
,, " ' .hip is found at Ahydos. The so-called Book
" ' llw Dead, or early fragments of it, are known to
le ",. been in use in Egypt early in the 0 !'irian era.
Nnw the Book of the Dead is obviously, in its
•.ulier fragments, the written expression of a much
..td,·r ritual dating from prehistoric times, and
"•~:· ·~ted into writing in early D ynastic or late pre-
1'' n.tstic Limes. It is also the hook of Osiris and
tl..- Osirian cult. Dr. Budg-e says of Osiris "his
""'11•' and origin were possibly Libyan, " that is, he
• •nw from the West.
S.lllconjathon, the Carthaginian writer, tells us
th.et the cult of the Cabiri, a mysterious religion,
••llginated in North-·West Africa, and was delivered
tii1Hilg" others " to the Egyptian Osiris." The
I .tl.iri are said by Sanconiathon to have been the
Ill \ ··ntorc; nf boats, of the arts of fishing, building and
•1
:••<••lturc, wriling and medicine. There is little
32 T h e M. y s t e r i e s o f Br i t a i n
doubt, indeed, that they were the old civilized race
of the West, whom we have seen penetrating to
liritish shores in their dug-out canoes. If Osiris was
one of its apostles, then the religion of the Cabiri
was mereiy the Cult of the Dead, as Sanconiathon
asserts. Cicero calls the Cabiri the " Sons of
Proserpine," goddess of the Underworld, which is
to say a:. much. Dionysus of Halicarnassus,
Macrobius, Varro, and others, regarded the Cabiri
as the Penates of the Romans, that is the dead
presiding as household familiars, and Vossius thought
them the ministers of the gods who were deified after
their death. Strabo regarded them as the ministers
of Hecate, and Uochart recognized them as
"infernal deities. "•
This Cabirian cult, then, hailing from North-West
Africa, is evidently nothing but a dim survival or
memorial of the ancient civilized race of that region,
which made its way into Spain, and after undergoing
many phases there from Palceolithic to Neolithic
times, gradually found its way, or sent its doctrine
of the Cult of the Dead, to Egypt on the one hand
and to Britain on the other. This theory explains in
a word all the notions of Egyptian influence in
Britain, and the manyapparent resemblances between
Egyptian and British mysticism and folk-belief.
But it may be said, and with some justice, that all
this is scarcely of the nature of evidence. Who,
a[tcr all, was Sanconiathon, someone may ask, the
problematical Carthaginian model of a late Roman
writer? It has, however, been proved long ago that
Sanconiathon's account was in all probability genuine
enough. Still, let us get on to firmer footing. We
have it on the soundest authority that more than
one race of African origin invaded or crossed over to

Jo.urope in Palceolithic and Neolithic times. Great
th~·ories, indeed, stand or fall by this assertion, and
they are backed by sturdy proofs enow. The
l:apsian Culture, which came to Europe as we have
•l 'l'll, emanated from North-West Africa; it is,
uul ·ed, named after Capsa or Gafsa in Tunis. The
,\ zilian culture is also indisputably African. " With
lilt' Capsian cultw·e," says Professor Macalister,

till' Capsian flint industry is the parent of the
\ ;.ilian-Tardenoisian." The Azilian culture in
,,.. earliest phase is to be found in North-West
;\lrica.
Now my point is that these ancient cultures were
llllurishing in North-West Africa and Spain at a
1••·riod about 10,000 years ago anrl more, when
I•g-ypt had no definite culture of any kind whatsoever,,

llw Solutrean or late Aurignacian. The North
\ frican cuUus had, indeed, been preceded by that of
1 uiUch older race, the Cro-Magnon, which seems
to have arrived in Spain about 20,000 years ago, and
whic:h certainly laid the foundations of the art of
uutrnmification. Yet in face of these facts the
( >
ricntalists" insist that "civilization" is of older
•''·~in in Egypt and the East ! Is it contended that
tlw •·arly culture of the Aurignacians, Capsians, and
.\ , dians, primitive Lhough it was, did not precede
111
yLhing ~gypt had to show, that they perished
tlllt·rly and transmitted no traditions either to the
I'' t~ples who succeeded them or to the East? Is it
•jltilt• improbable that their cultural and religious
td••.ts , however elementary, did not gradually and in
tlw course of ages find their way to Egypt (where
"'' ~ developed under more favourable conditions) as
c
34 Th e Mysteries of Britain
they certainly did to Britain at a later time by a much
more difftcult a nd dangerous route? Or is it
comended that the similarity between ~heir beginnings
and that of Egypt is merely fortuitous?
Professor Macalister, in a memorable passage in
his Handbook of Europea" Al'chreology, gives
it as his opinion that the Aurignacian race originated
in Central Africa. All authorities agree that the
Capsian and Azilian cultures developed in North-
West Africa. That this culture reached the East
and may have sent back cultural gifts in a superior
form to Western Europe at a later period, I do not
for a moment deny. But that is altogether another
matter, and in any case the " Orientalists" have
grossly exaggerated the importance of the ''come-
back''. The point is that the earliest signs of
civilization appear in North-Western Africa and
Western Europe, and that nothing analogous appears
in Egypt until about 9000 B.c., and even that date
is dubious.
Now it cannot be questioned that the earliest
civilized inhabitants o{ Egypt were of Iberian stock.
Mr. H. R. H all, an excc•llcnt authority, speaking o£
the earliest inhabitant!' of Egypt, says : " We see
Egypt originally inhabited by a stone-using H amitic
race (the Iberians) rclatcu to the surrounding
Semites, Libyans, and leditcrraneans." Again,
he says: " In the Delta, they (the invading
Armenoids) probably found a civilization of a
primitive l\[editerranean type much more advanced
than in the Upper country. T he hiero-
glyphic system, and all the accompanying culture
that it implies, may have been theirs, but was more
likely 1\lediterranean."'

peoples of Britain are still to be found in their pristine
entirety among their Iberian kindred in North-West
Africa. That the entire rite of Beltane, a rite
adopted from the British Jberians hv the Kelts,
should survive in Morocco is, perhaps, the best proof
not only of the Iberian origin of Druidism, but of the
fact that an Iberian people actually brought it to
our island.
The earliest notices of religion in Britain allude
to a strange cult called Druidism, which, as we have
seen, the Gauls believed to have originated in the
country. An extraordinary mass of ponderous
nonsense has been accumulated through the centuries
relative to the nature and beliefs of this cult, and it
is only recently that modern methods of study have
been applied to the examination of such fragmentary
material relative to it a~ is worthv of examination
and has come down to us. In his remarkably
interesting book The TJmids, a study in Keltic
Prel1istory' Mr. T. n. Kendrick, of the Rritic;h
Museum, has succeeded in placing the entire question
on a much more tolerable basis than formerly, and
has made it possible to draw certain more or less
final ~onclusions regarding the origins and nature of
Druidism.
H e is of the opinion that the Saxon invasion
blotted out all memory of the Oruicls in Britain, and
that this was gradually recovered only by the scholar-
ship of the sixteenth century, a conclusion which is
certainly open to challenge, as I hope to show later.
But he is abundantly justified in his statement that
the romantic revival ridiculously exaggerated the
tradition of Druidism, describing it, however
alluringly, in an unnatural and theatrical manner.

Who, then, were the Druids? What were the
""':'"h of Druidism, what was its nature and forms
..1 w11r~hip? T o these questions which have
' •tl. a
l l'J British archreology for nearly four centuries
11 •·· still impossible to supply dennite and concrete
111 .\\ t·rs, but they are now capable of being
'. l'lwd to m a sufficiently satisfactory general
111. 11111(,;1'.
1\lthough at the dawn of British history we
It .•••ver Druidism as a cult practised officially by a
I" 11pll· o( Keltic race, there is every reason to believe
d, '' it was not of Keltic origin, but had been adopted
J,, the Keltic invaders of Britain from her older and
,.,..•.c,ding population. But Mr. Kendrick refuses to
'll·.t uss Druidic origins in Britain other than in the
1•1•h1 of what we know of Druidism in Gaul, on the
~:"•trmls that in Britain ' it is too nebulous a thing to
dlow a reasonable basis for discussion." Nor can
lw '•lJUare Druidic ascendancy in Gaul with Ccesar's
1.11 ·ment that it originated in our island, to which
tlw Kelts had penetrated only after their arrival in
I ..tttl. Cresar, he believes, merely recorded an
"l'111ion, not a statement of fact, whic-h, however, was
H.·.ociated with the information that serious devotees
••1 I ~ruidism betook themselves to Britain for its
•l••scr study.
l1
10ceeding, Mr. Kendrick reasonably infers that,
dul Druidism originate in Britain, it must have been
, .t.thlished here long before C<esar wrote. From a
l'· '·.~.tge in Diogenes Lrertius (\'itre, intro. 1.) we
... ,. aware that Sotion of Alexandria had alluded to
I It wdism as early as about 200 B.c. in the twenty-
tltu d book of his Succession of Philosophers, now
38 The My ~ t er i es of Britai n
lost. Its origin in Gaul, and, a fortiori, in Britain,
were this the place of its beginning, must thus be of
still g reater antiquity, and, accepting the statement in
Cce.c;nr'~ writing~ ;1~ ;1 11 expression of a general
belief, I\1 r. Kendrick finds it " difficult to resist the
conclusion that at the beginning o[ the La Tene
period (the Iron Age) at the time of the first Keltic
trafftc.: with England, there existed in our country
some no,·el re-ligious clement that after the Keltic
invasion was grafted upon Keltic faith and spread
throughout Gaul, giving rise to what thenceforward
was termed Druidism."
But what was the specifically British element in
Druidism? he asks. Was it the priesthood itself, or
the Druidic theology or dogma? It does not seem
likely to have been the first, in view of the complete
subjugation of the conquering K elts by a defeated
caste which it implies. Nor were the Roman
invaders particularly imprc~~ed by the Druid
hq~emony in Britain, to which they vouchsafe only
passing mention.
But certain of the Keltic tribes and confederates
did not have Druids, who seem to have been confined
to Gaul and Britain. The original Keltic province
lying between Switzerland and Hungary where the
La T ene iron culture arose was certainly not
peopled by a homogeneous race, if it enjoyed a
common culture and language, and when at last it
broke up in emigration its different elements were
unlikely to retain the self-same religious ideas. For
thi~ and other reasons, Mr. Kendrick believes
Druidism in Gaul to have been of Keltic origin, and
he cm1 find nothing in its beliefs " that was not also
known to one or other of the indogermanic peoples."
H e acimits that there is not " much encouragement
for inquiry on these lines," however, and "that the
I n t ro du cto r y 39
tUIH hns come to attempt another method of
I ..
'f'lllclaC1.
I hi~:. Mr. Kendrick also admits, is "merely a
It\ p••Litctical reconstruction of events." Summarized,
11 o~Jttounts to this : Gaul and Britain during the
H'""''' Age had achieved a general cultural unity
11111 c·11joyed intimate trade relations. This implies
1 • ••ttaill religious unity. Two distinct provinces of
1 ulhtr<! in this area can be disti~ouished--one
\Vo·•.l('rn Gaul, Ireland, and Western and South-
\\f,...t,·m England, the other and more important,
rJntthcrn Gaul and South-Eastern and Eastern
l•ut.f.uul. The common religious bond joining all
''''"·' ha\'e been of high antiquity, as a homogeneous
lltnt culture had prevailed over the entire area for
1''''"' .111ds of vears.
llttl at the beginning of the Iron Age Britain
1.. c. ttllC' relatively more secluded because of the
' " 1\ l.ig-urian nncl East Germanic influences which
•.,. c·hanging Continental civilization, and had,
1l11 ,,.r,•rcI better opportunities for preserving its
"" w11t relig-ion in a pure form. This gave it a
,, J,.~iuus distinction" on the Continent, and "native
..,,.,prise'' may have clone the rest. At this
pinclttrc the Kelts arrived in Eastern and Nort.h-
1
· , t.·n• Gaul, developing their special iron culture
"' dw La T ene rype in the Marne area. It has been
1
.. '"'ll that Stone Age artistic traditions in this very
uc•,, were preserved until Roman times, and there
. • "''• t<l be "an equal probability of the persistence

~ I " '" ' area. In Britain they encounter the same

faith in its pristine purity, and would, therefore,
have no difficulty in its adoption.
At the period of the concentration of the K elts in
their ancient home in the Alpine lands and in Central
Europe they had not yet organized a priestly class of
their own , but when they did so at last, they did so
in Gaul, Mr. K endrick hclicves, at some time in the
fourth or third century n.c. T hus th<' ori{Yin of
D ruids and of Druidism nre difTPrent <'vents clue to
different causes. Druidism in Gaul, for 1r.
Kendrick, is Keltic religion nfter amalgamation with
the native faith it found in Gaul on its settlement
there. Druidism in Britain is the inclusion in the
K elticized faith of the ancient native British religion,
whicp in itself was a purer form of thr C'nntinental
native element in Druidism.
But while Druidism in Gaul was govrrned by a
priestly caste , it seems to have been in Britain still
under the sway of kings nnd chiefs rather than a
priesthood. At the time of the Kcltir invasion of
our island the Continental Kelts of Gaul had not \"et
developed the system. T hose who callecl themselves
"Druids, " when at last the- word was introducerl ,
" were only the magicians <tnd soothsayers of a
fug-itive and desperate people " shatt<>rcd by the
Belgic occupation and the coming of the Romans.
In view of evidence to the contrary it ic; difficult to
agree with Mr. K endrick on this hcarl, and his
attitude regarding it appe<trs to me rather dclibl"'rately
wa)rward , as I hope to be able to show, although he
seems more favourably disposed to the theory of a
Druidic official priesthood in I relancl, a " faint
reflection ' ' of the Gallic system.
If J have paraphrased rvfr. K endrick's conclusions
at some length, I h;\ve done so because they agree
with my own so completely that on perusing hie;

the superstructure which 1 hope to erect on the

.tppear to me rather unjustified. and in this prelimin-
·try examination of the Druidic question 1 feel I
"hnuld advance my own views before approaching
11ther issues.

1\Tr. K encirick's expressed intention to employ only
•arrh materials as might justly be classed as
"historical" , and as the whole tennr of the present
volume is in consonance with tradition, it is
nnnecessary to stress the point, which we will have
.thundant opportunity of returning to. But the
.drnost entire neglect of the traditional aspect of his
·.11hject takes a more positive form when he gives it
.t•; his opinion that the Saxon invasion blotted our all
rt11'mory of the Druids in Britain, anci that the
' •.,.,,J1ection of them was only recovered by later
•.d mlarship. The truth is that a hundreci customs.

as numerous in alleg<"dly Saxon England as in Keltic
Scotland and Ireland. All the same, these may not
have been remembered as "Druidic." As in this
chapter 1am dealing with generalities alone, I refrain
from citing instances, and leave for the moment the
question of the Druidic nature of these rites, but I
hope to adduce testimony that not only did a concrete
memory of Druidism survive the Saxon invasion, but
that a very powerful traditional recollection of it was
handed down, and that the ripest Keltic scholar!'hip
is equal to the refutation of the theory that local
place-names display only a fragmentary reminiscence
of it, as Mr. Kendrick believes.
The argument that no regular and official caste of
Druids existed in Britain, and that they were only
the magi and sorcerers of ''a fugitive and desperate
people'' at the time of the coming of the Romans
seems not only to lack cogency, but to run directly
counter to all the evidence. The very circumstance
that the Gauls sent their neophytes to our island for
instruction, is in itself almost sufficient to refute it.
To whom did these apply for instruction in the
priestly art and function? To the native kings and
chiefs, whom, Mr. Kendrick supposes, took the place
in Britain of the official priesthood in Gaul? Not
only is this highly unlikely on the face of it, but the
existence of a large and powerful caste of Druids in
J\1ona or Anglesea refutes it. Tacitus distinctly
alludes to 1\1ona as the last refuge of Druidism in
Britain ("insulam incolis validam et perfugarum
receptaculum"), and this accounts for the absence of
Druids in other parts of what is now England at a
certain period. And I shall only remark here that
the best possible evidence exists of the presence in
Scotland at a much later date of a caste of Pictish
Druids who owed nothing to Irish culture, and who

I'' " 1ical commonsense in modern archceology, and
11 1. hadly needed here. It has been made clear by
I ( ':Hnille Jullian that the Gaulish Druids took a

his foes. I submit that this is a case where the
absence of records is more t'lnquenL than their
presence. vVe have also to bear in mind that Ccesar
had only a very limited knowledge of Britain, and
that he expressly states that only the south-eastern
coasts were inhabited by the non-Druidic Belgce.
1 Ir. T. Rice llolmes reasonablv condudes : " 1t was
British Druidism that supported and renovated
rhe Druidism of Gaul, and formed one of the bonds
of union between the two Kehic lands."• In any
case it is sufficient for our purpose that Cresar
distinctly states that Britain wa..-; the lccra of Druid
disciples, and that Tacitus makes it clear that
1\nglesea was an important Uruicl centre. The two
facts combined suffice to demonstrate that Druidism,
so far from languishing in Britain, had a powerful
hold iu the island. lt remains to show later that
this authority and tradition was not destroyed in
Roman times, but was retained as a secondary and
secret faith in many parts of the country long
subsequent to the introduction of Christianity, and
that it contributed largely tu the secret arcane
tradition of the island of 13ritain.
The late Sir John Rhys was originally of the
opinion that Druidism reached Gaul " undoubtedly
through the Belgre, who had settled in Britain''.
But in a later publication he gave it as his opinion
that other people of Brythonic stock preceded the
Belgce in our island. From this he g-athered that
the date of the first mention of Druidism threw no
light on its place of origin. H e alsn U('licved that
no " Belgic or f3rythonic people ever had Druids",
but received the belief from the older non-Keltic
inhabitants.
That the I)ruids used the stone circles of Britain

fl)r religious purposes is denied almost by the
mllcctive opinion of modern arc-h~olngy. T radition
.t-. unanimously credits them with the erection of
111ost o( our rough stone monuments, but tradition,
according to the modern archreologist, is "an ass".
The writer of the official Government guide to
Stonehenge dismisses the theory in a few scathing
sentences,' as does Mr. T. Rice Holmes, who admit.c;
that "in this country also the belief has long
heen growing that Druidism was of non-Kcltic
origin".' Yet ~I . Salomon Reinac-h3 attrihutf'S
1he megalithic monuments of Gaul to Druidic
i111luence.
The truth is that the stone monuments, or most of
them, were constructed at a period so relatively early
that it is extremely difficult to posit very much
mncerning the religion of the people who raised
them. Mr. Stevens thinks that " it would not be
i11consistent with existing evidence to set the date of
'-ltonehenge roughly at from I 700- I 8oo years R.c.' ' .
Now this is precisely the period at which the men
from Spain, whose culture is referable much farther
1.:-tck to North-West J\frican sources, were voyaging-
ln Britain and seemingly settling there. Whether
lhC'ir cult was " Druidism" or not, it certainly had
i11 it the germs of that Iberian faith from which
I)ruidism later resulted, so that if Stonehenge and
other circles of the kind were not "built by the
I)ruids'', they may at least have been erected by
proto-Druids, as I fully believe posterity will
disrover, by a people who, if they had not yet finallr
dc·vcloped the faith of Druidism, which they were
lnu11d in possession of in C::esar's time , nearly

46 Th e Mys t e r ies or Br it a in
seventeen hundred years later, were at least develop-
ing its tenets.
H the theory I have put forward in this book is
worth anything at all, it must stand or fall by proof,
to be adduced as we le::~rn more of our megalithic
monuments, that the development of Druidism was
associated with them. Druidism was a thing
"Iberian" in the first instance, and so were they.
Stonehenge was built at a period when the bronze
culture had begun to overlap that of polished stone.
Mr. Kendrick, from technical considerations,
believes it to have heen erected in the La T ene
or Iron Age. " If," he says, " Stonehenge was
not a temple of Druidism, then it must have been
a disused ruin in the La Tene period, when Druidism
was the religion of the land." H e also points to
the fact that a La T ene man was buried within its
area, and believes that the '' Kelticized population
of \Vesscx took advantage of the ancient national
sanctity of the old circle-site on Salisbury Plain to
construct thereon a temple for their faith that should
serve as a rallying-point, and, more than that, a
stimulus, for D ruidism after the failure of the order
in Gaul, that is to say, in the ISt century B.c. "
H e does not, however, class the other British
megalithic structures along with Stonehenge, which
he regards as relatively "classical" to their type,
and sophisticated by Mediterranean architectural
models. But he wisely concludes that the true
temples of the Druids in general were natural groves,
except whPn the gradual influence of civilization
"prompted them to translate the groves into build-
ings", such as Stonehenge, thus wiping out the
possibility of the megalithic alt:-trs and rude stone
circles being Oruidir. But, as I have suggested,
they ntaJ' ha,·e bPen proto-Druidic.
CHAPTER II
THE CULT OF THE DEAD
INour search for the origins of the ancient mysticism
of Britain we are almost immediately arrested by the
absorbing question of Druidism, which, like an
immense forest, seems to draw all paths to it. As
I have shown, efforts have been made to prove that
Druidism scarcely flourished with such vigour in our
i~land as in Gaul, and that in any case the Roman
oc·cupation speedily stamped it out. But the
.tlllhorities who have advanced this view have
"miued all consideration of the question of its
··11rvivals, those festivals and popular rites which can
i~tdllbitably be proved to have been derived from it,
.tntl which not only illustrate its former ascendancy
111 Britain, but its age-long presence in the by-ways
n( popular affection for centuries after the Saxon
invasion of England.
As I have said tentatively, I believe Druidism to
kwc arisen out of a Cult of the Dead which had
gradually been taking form during the long centuries
,,f the Old Stone Age, and which, in the New Stone
1\ge, had in a generalized state been disseminated
t•:tst and west from s0me point in North-West Africa
In Spain on the one hand and to Egypt on the other.
From the former country it gradually found its way,
hnth directly and through Gaul, to Britain. At the
'nmmencement of the Iron Age it became more
•·specially segregated in this island, which at that
period was more culturally apart Crom the Continent
.7
48 The Myste ries of Britain
than during the Bronze Age. That this cult took
on the colours of its environment in both Egypt and
Britain is scarcely to be wondered at, but that it
remained a Cult of the Dead in both countries there
is evidence irrefragable.
That evidence, in the case of Egyptian religion,
is so generally accepted as to need no demonstration
here. But as regards its application to the early
British faith, proof is essential, for the reason that
so far it has not been tested or even advanced
theoreticaUy in any but a rather perfunctory way.
Let us see then what evidence exists that Druidism
· was actually a branch of the great Iberian or
Mediterranean Cult of the Dead.
" The Gauls," says Ccesar,' "state that they are
all descended from a common father, Dis, and say
that this is the tradition of the Druids." Now Dis
is merely the Latin form of Pluto or Hades, god of
the dead, lord of the shadowy region of the departed.
T o him is ascribed the invention of honouring the
dead with funeral obsequies, and he it was who seized
upon Proserpine and haled her off to his gloomy
dwelling beneath the earth. Black bulls were his
victims in sacrifice, the river Styx must be ferried
to reach his realm. According to Rhys, he is the
Keltic god Llyr, or Bran.
" With grand contempt for the mortal lot," says
Ammanus MarceUinus,, " they professed the immor-
tality of the soul." " One of their dogmas, " writes
Pomponius Mela,3 "has come to common know-
ledge, namely, that souls are eternal, and that there
is another Life in the infernal regions. . And
it is for this reason, too, that they burn or bw·y with
their dead things appropriate to them in life, and that
in times past they even used to defer the completion

"''ivai in another world. Indeed, there were some
••I them who flung themselves willingly on the funeral
J•llcs of their relatives in order to share the new life
with them."
Valerius Maximus,' describing the Druids of
•.outhern Franee, says : " It is said that they lend to
c·.~e:h other sums that are repayable in the next
world, so firmly are they convinced that the souls
nf men are immortal.''
T hat they sacrificed criminals and even the
umocent to the numes of the dead or to the gods of
tlw dead is also clear enough from the statements
.,r C;:esar, Dion Cassius, Tacitus, Diodorus Siculus,
.111d olher classical writers. This is a practice which
t.tn spring only from one idea, that of placation of
the dead. True, it is occasionally to be observed
,,., an offering to the powers of growth, a rite of the
lt'surrection of the "dead", so to speak, but its early
hi-;tory and origin undoubtedly point in the first
111slance to a rite intended for the placation of the
tlc'rcased, and its relics are to be found in ancient
E).,rypt and elsewhere. Cresar• informs us that it was
·• rustom of the Gauls to immolate the favourite
.111imals of the dead man on the funeral pile, and he
.11lds that not long before his time slaves and
t d :tiners had been sacrificed. " Their funerals," he
·..rys, " are very sumptuous and magnificent in
111oportion to their quality. Everything that the
dt·<·cased person set the greatest value on is cast into
!Ill' pile, even animals, and formerly those vassals
.rud clients whom they held the dearest were obliged
tn attend them to the other world." T hey also
lwlic·ved " that the gods are never appeased but
by the death of one man for another , wherefore they

50 The l\l ysteries of Br itain
have public offerings of the kind which are committed
to the care of the Druids, who have large, hollow
images bound about with osiers , into which they put
men alive, and, setting fire to the image, suffocate
them. They believe thieves, outlaws, and other
offenders to be the most grateful offerings to the gods,
but, when honesty has made them scarce, the
innocent are forced to supply their places."
That the Cult of the Dead was well developed
among the Kelts there nre many other evidences.
The bards sang the praises of departed heroes, and
the tombs of some of these were regarded as sacred
places. More than one Irish god was believed to
have his dwelling in a burial cairn. In some ca~es
the dead were interred around the family hearth, the
spot round which the clomestic lares or ghosts were
wont to congregate. On All Souls' Eve the Kelts
of Brittany are still accustomed to spread a feast for
the hungry dead, as did the Ero ptians periodically.
The ram and the serpent, Keltic !'ymbols of the
Underworld, are discovered as figurines among
Gaulish grave-goods.
Canon l\IacCulloch, writing nn the Cult of the
Dead in his compendious work The Religion of the
A ncicnl Celts, says :
The dead were nl~o fl·tl a1 tll1· g-rave or in the hou~e.
Thu~ cups were pl:ln·ol in tlu· n·c·ess of a well in the
rhurchyard of Kilrancla~h hy tlm"c interring a child

supply the other spirits with w:•tf•r frnm these cups. In
Ireland, after a death, foot! i... pl:wcd out for the ::.pirits,

part., of France milk i:. poun·d out on tile grave, and both
in Brittany and in St·otland tin: dcnd nrc supposed to
partake of U1c funeral [east. These arc survivals of
pagan times, and corrcsponu to the rites in u~c among
those who still worship ancestors. In Kehic di:.tricts a
cairn or a cross is placed over the spot where a violent
or accidental death has occurred, the purpose being to
T he C u It o f t he D ea d 51
.1ppeasc the ghost, and a stone is often alldcd to the
•·airn by ::til pn,;..,l•rs-hy.•
'I he practice of holding funeral games was also a
1\.c.:ltic rite associated with the Cult of the Dead, anc
' n '<tlls the Trojan obsequies. The dead were
lrHnmemorated at certain of the [estivals of fertility,
·'" h as I .u5ruasad and . amhain, which S}rmbolized
1lw birth and death of vegetation, nnd which appear
In have arisen out of the notion that certain slain
twrsons represemed spirits of fertility. " The time
ol earth 's decay," says Canon MacCulloch, "was
lltr· season when the dead, her children, would be
mmmemorated. "~ Sir James Fraser believes that
dtt.: feast of All Saints (No,·ember 1st) was intended
111 L:lke the place of the pagan Cult of the Dead.3
Now this form of the Cult o[ the De..'ld, as mani-
ll'stccl in Druidism, must not be directly identified
wili1 the P) Lhagorean doctrine o[ re-birth or metcm-
t•··>rhosic;, according to which the soul took another
ltodily shape after death. It is clear that in Druidism
w•· have an ancient and conservative form of the Cult
••f the Dead preserving a more early phase of it than
1ltat which was cle,·eloped in Egypt. l\lr. Kendrick
has shown that although C::esar identified the belief
,,f the Druids in immortality with the Pythagorean
dnt trine, and was followed in so doing by Hippolytus,
( :tement, Valerius l\Iaximus, and others, that they
probably knew of it only in terms of Cresar's slate-
nwnl, that it was improbable that any intercourse
1nnk place between Pythagoras or his disciples and
dw Kelts, so brief was the vogue o£ his doctrine and
·" circumscribed its scope. Again, " The recorded
IIISl;"~nces of resemblances between the Druidic and
I'\'thagorean systems are not sufficiently remarkable

secondly, in each case the growth of the systems can
he explained in local terms without recnurse to such
distant borrowings" . He observes, too, that the
views of the Gauls on the qw·stion of the soul's
immortality, quoted above from J\llela, show that they
did not at all appreciate or profess Pythagoras's
reaching , "according to which such cominued enjoy-
ment of one's belongings or the transaction of
postponed affairs after death was impossible. They
could not have believed, it is d ear, in an instant
metempsychosis , perh:-tps intn animal as into other
human bodies, but rather in the survival of the
identity of the deceased in its recognizable form. "•
Mr. Kendrick then proceeds to search Keltic litera-
Lure for instances of a belief in metempsychosis, and
discovers several allegories, which, he demonstrates,
although occasionally produced to assist the theory of
transmigration, are scarcely illustrative of the belief.
But a far more trustworthy method of arriving at
the true significance of the Druidic or ancient British
Cult of the Dead, with its bC'licf that souls might
return to the body, is to be found in the survival of
an idea which ct\n readily enough be linked with
ancient Keltic dogma. The Keltic belief in a race
of sidhe or fairies, by no means yet abolished, is most
definitely a relic of the great Cult of the Dead as it
flourished in Druidic times and, indeed, supplies all
the evidence required that Druidism was essentially
a mxstery associated with the Otherworld and the
belief in a process of reincarnation- but a reincarna-
tion taking place at a period sufficiently removed from
death to permit of a more or less prolonged existence
in the Otherworld.
Research has now made it clear that the Keltic
sidhe or "fairies" , as the word has rather loosely
• up. cit. p. 1o8.
T he C u It o f the Dead 53
lw<·n translated, are nothing more or less than the
.pnits of the dead. As the fairies of later folklore they
.tH ' abo, obviously enough, the ghosts o£the departed.
T hat in many countries fairies were regarded as
mnnected with the dead there is proof pressed down
.utd running over. They were thought of as dwelling
111 a d=m, subterranean sphere, in sepulchral barrows,
1 •r in a far paradise, like those fays encountered by
( lgicr the Dane or Thomas the Rymour. T he Fairy
IJucen in the old ballad warns Thomas against eating
1he apples and pears which hung in her gardens, for
'" partake of the food of the dead is to know no
1 <·turn. This place of faery seems to be the same
as the island of Avallon (the Place of Apples) or the
Keltic T ir-nan-Og, the Land of Heart's Desire and
n·newed youth. A fairy who taught sorcery to the
Scottish witches was said to have been killed at the
battle of Pinkie some thirty years before. I think,
1uo, that in the wearing of butterflies' wings by the
fays of art and folk-tale one can discern a folk-
memory of that Keltic belief that butterflies were the
•;nuls of the dead. Some races stiU retain the belief
that on the death of a person his soul at once takes
up its abode in the body of a new-born child. But the
fairies arc souls waiting their turn in a dim paradise
lor an opportunity to recommence the earth-life.
The belief that the fays were a dwarfish race
·'I'I'Cc"lrs to have been a later borrowing from the idea
.,f the small and swarming T eutonic elves. The fays
,,f Keltic folklore are of normal human height. The
ltish sidhe, Morgan le Fay, the Welsh Y Mamau,
..r "the Mothers", are all of mortal bulk. So were
1lw Breton fays, and those Scottish fairies who
1 .mied ofE Tamlane and taught witches the lore of
1l w sorcerer. And each and all of them were in some
111.1111\c r associated with the realm of the departed.
54 Th e Mys te r ies o f Br ita in
The belie£ in fairy changelings is obviously the
survival of an idea that the souls of the dead return
to inhabit the bodies of mortal chlldren. Faerie is,
indeed, like the Melanesian mana, a great reservoir
of soul-force, to which the human spirit, its bodily
sheath destroved or outworn, returns, and which is
ever ready to pour out its psychic energy into the
new-born mortal Erame.
T he belief in the sidhe or fairies, the dead awaiting
a return to mortal life, was essentially a feature of
Druidic belief, as early l rish and later Welsh
literature shows, and this in itself suffices to demon-
strate th<
ll Druidism was a Cult o( the Dead. H ow
far the idea of the sidhe was Keltic and how far
aboriginal or llwrian is a problem the answer to which
is not far to seck, for we lind the sidhe constantly
associated with buri:-~1 chambers in Treland and Scot-
land which were originally of Iberian or "aboriginal"
origin. That they were accepted and used as Keltic
and Druidic Lurial-places is certain enough, indeed
they were probably employed in many cases as graves
by successive generations in Irdand and Britain for
centuries, as excavation has abundantly prnved.
But if Druidism was, like the reli~inn of E gypt.
a Cult of the Dead, it was so with a diflerence. That
cult was of early and rapid development in Egypt
owing chietly to its exceptionally hot and dry climate,
which seems to have suggested and even naturally
favoured the process of mummification. In Britain
Lhe CulL of the Dead passed through the same early
phases as in Egypt, that is, coloraLirm of the bones
with red pigment, probable wrapping in skins, and
cairn-burial accompanied by grave-goods. Here and
there, too, large monolithic temples, somewhat
resembling the gro\·e-like pillared structures of
Egypt, arose in assoc-iation with it.
Th e CuIt o f t he De ad 55
But when the Kelts entered Britain, bringing with
llwm the La T cne iron culture, they appear to have
introduced a form of thought somewhat opposed to
rhe ancient Iberian or I\Tcditcrranean belief in the
ru.;:cessity for preserving the relics of the dead. There
··\·ems to have been a clash of ideas between the
Keltic conquerors and the Iberian inhabitants which,
i11 the event, resulted in a confusion of ideas, the
an·cp~~'lnce on cithcr side of a part of the religious
),cliefs of the oth\.!r. The K elts seem at first to have
le.tred or dislikeJ the Cult of the Dead as they found
it in Gaul and Britain. Instead of regarding life as
.t mere ante-chamber of death, a preparation for the
ltcrC'after, as did the Iberians of Egypt and Britain,
tiJc
'y r;tlher considered it as 011e of the main objects
of rc:ligion to prc:scn ·e life in the 11eshly body, and
tn keep th€' \\"Orld o( spirits at bay by placation and
c11h..:r means, as many other primitive people have
doue and still do . This explains their partiality for
the mistletoe, the plant and emblem of life, the divine
life-substance or protoplasm, their aversion from
thieves, highwaymen, and murderers, whom they
J,urnecl in the sacred fires along with the beasts of

wag-ed relentless war upon, and this outlook is still,
:tnd always has been, lj pical of British popular
philosophy and folk-sentiment. The K elt was
ltnilied of the sidl!c or fairies, the spirits of the dead,
to wpnm the f·:h')'ptians and Babylonians paid such
nwticulous reverence. The Oriental has always been
mrnt•arauvely indifferent to or acquiescent in the idea
nf clc:;tth ; the \Ve!'terner hac.; almost from the first
clrl'atled and t.lisliked it ; and in this difference of
.ttlitude we shall probably find grounds for much of
tltc· objection to early British survivals in later times.
56 The Mys teries of Britain
But the Kelts could not altogether overcome the
Iberian predilection for the worship nf the departed,
and had necessarily to compound with it. This
explains, for example, their doctrine that money lent
during life might be repaid in the Otherworld. Time
and again we find the Cult of the Dead breaking
through the structure of Druidism or Iberian-Keltic
religion, merging with it at last in a complete pattern
to compose a very special type of British l\1ysticism.
If these conclusions be granted, we are now
enabled to take a clearer view of Druidism and to
correct, in virtue of the light thus vouchsafed us,
older theories concerning its tenets and practice.
They may also assist us in allotting to folk-beliefs
of later times, traditional festivals and the like, a
Druidical significance so far as their manifestations
square with the known facts .
All the evidence, classical and otherwise, goes to
show that the Druids were a well-defined, priestly
class with sub-divisions having oifTC'rCnt functions,
religious, oracular , m<tgical, administrative , and
hardic. D iodorus , Strabo , and Timagenes, Cicero
and Tacitus, allude to these c-lasses separately or
generally. The Irish evidence substantiaces their
existence. The Gaulish Druids, prophets, and bards
ar<> reflected in the Jrish l>ruids, Fathi or Vatcs, and
Filid or poeLc;. In W ales both Druids and bards
arc found, and long after Druidism had outw::trdly
vanished in the Principality the der'lvj•dd-vm·d, or
Druid-bard , survived as a repository nf Druid
philosophy and belief. That both sections of the
KeiLic race, Goidelic and Brythonic, were under the
sway of the Druids is abundantly d ear. That Keltic
religion and Druidism are intcrchang<:'ablc terms is
also indubitable . That is as much as to say that it
was nor rhe mere addition of something lhcrian and
The Cult of t he Dead 57
.thoriginal as an annexe to Keltic faith, but a long-
' 111Hinucd and well-developed fusion of early Keltic
lwlicf with Iberian belief, welded as to its parts, as
the Kelt-Iberian race had been welded in Spain and
Southern Gaul, and thus the psychological con-
mmilant of the physical and racial admixture. The
same process took place in Britain as on the
Continent, the Iberian and Keltic races fusing in
1hese islands in the same manner, and producing a
like religious result. Only, by virtue of segregation
from Lhe Continent, Druidism in Britain seems to
have taken on a special and insular colouring, and to
have survived for a considerably longer period in the
more outlying parts of the British archipelago.
Those who exalt the knowledge and philosophy
n[ the Druids to supreme heights of magical and
mystical ascendancy are obviously as mistaken as
the opposing school who wish to reduce their status
In that of mere witch-doctors. The probability is
1hat they were at least the equals in scientific ability
ami general scholarship with the E gyptian priest-
hood of the closing centuries of the last pre-Christian
millennium. Pomponius Mela refers to them as
"trachers of wisdom", anti as professing a know-
lt·dge of the size and shape of the world, and the
movemt'nts of the heavens and stars. T hey were,
he says, the instructors of the Gallic nobles.
C;-rs.'lr alludes to the Druids as teachers held in
1:rent honour, learning a great number of verses by
n•le as part of their mystery, making use of G reek
l1·tters, and versed in astronomical science.

iviciacus, the IEdur~n Druid, is quoted by Cicero
...~ having "that knowlecige of Nature which the
Creeks caU P.hysiologia". Says Mr. Kendrick:
Thic;, in conjunc-tion with Crosar 's testimony, throws a
Oood of light on the conditions of c:ervice in the priest-
58 Th e My s t e ri es o f Brita in
hood during the first century hefore Christ, and at once
disposes of the quite nawral idea that all it<; members
were secluded and mysterious ancients, holdjng- aloof
from the common world in a gloomy atmosphere of
esoteric ritual and priestly tahoos. For Divitiacus was
a man of affairs, acknowlcdgcrl ruler of the /Ed ui, and a
politician and diplomatist of cstabli~hcd reputation
throughout the wholt· of Caul.•
Diodorus Siculus describes the Druids as
"philosophers and theologians", and Amminnus
Marcellinus tells us th:tt they were "uplifLcd by
searchings into secret and sublime things" . Oion
Chrysostom says that "they conc-ern themselves with
divination and all branches of wisdom" .
Now I submit d1at all this goes to show that if the
Druids were not the possessors of a yast corpus of
native learning, they wcrc at the least br removed
from the status of mere medic-inc-men, which some
obviously rather cynical authorities profess to believe
they occupied. The very fact that they employed
written characters disposes of the charge, for it is
known that they possessed a system of writing peculiar
to themselves. This is the alphabet known as Ogham,
so called after Ogmios, the Keltic god of learning
and eloquence, a method of writing whirh seems to
have been confined entirelr within the four seas o(
Britain. Inscriptions carved in its charncters have
been discovereci on rough stone monuments, crom-
lechs, and other stones, as well as on fragments of
wood, in Cornwall, South \Val<'-
", the North and
\l\/est of Scotland, and in Ireland. Antiquarians
have been familiar with the key to these symbols for
upwards of a century (indeed, in some quarters it was
never lost), and it was readily found that the language

runner of the tongue now known as Q-Keltic or Gnelic.

primitive form. Indeed, il would be extremely
•r.rficult to point to a script more artless or more
l"·trtical in its design and ease of employment. It
n •nsists of a series of strokes written or carved on
··ithcr side, or both, of a dividing line. Thus for the
v• •wels the letter A is merely a single straight stroke
uu·cting the line at right-angk•s. 0 consists of two
·.imilar strokes, U of three, E of four, and I of five.
1-1 is a straight stroke beneath the line, and D,
T, C, and Q or K are represented by from two
I n five strokes of the same kind. 13, L, W, S, and
N are indicated by from one to five strokes above
dw line, whilst M, G, NG, F, and R are slanting
•.1rokes crossing the line from right to left. The
··\ <;lcm can be mastered, so far as its alphabetics are
•nurcrned, in less than a quarter of an hour, and
Iw.trs a close resemblance to the elementary exercises
'" Pitman's shorthand.
Another variety is known as Virgular Ogham, in
which thc strokes are indicated by a series of arrow-
lw.ul-;. In this system none of the strokes intersect
1h·· medial line. This line frequently consisted
11wn·ly 0f the edge or corner of the stone or stick
"'' "hidt the inscription was c:lrved ; that is, the
l.-1 I•·•s were rnrved on two faces of the stone, the

"' "1,. usc nf an even more interesting and certainly
ttt••••· involved system of writing . This, called by
' ll11ti•;h name, Bobileth, which may be translated
" l 11'1' writinf:!", consisted of thirty-four characters,
""' 111 ( )Jd I<chic, or Gaelic, was known as
60 T he M y s t e r i e s o r l3 r i t a i n
Bethluisnicm, from the names o[ the first three letters,
"Beth", the birch tree, "Luis", the quicken, and
"Nion", the ash. Of this alphabet each letter was
named after a tree. lt was written on tree bark, or
on smooth tablets of birchwood known in Erse as
Taible Fileadh, or "Poets' Tablets" , and the
characters themselves were described as " twigs"
and "branch-letters". It was to this kind of writing
that the Welsh bard Taliesin alluded when he sang :
'' l know every reed or twig in the cavern of the
chief di\"incr." The Bobileth script could be used
symbolically by composing a message made up of the
leaves of the appropriate trees strung on a cord, a
system whirh recalls the qujpus or messages of the
ancient lncan Peruvians made of knotted strings.
\ 'cry probably this was the original-or at least one
of the carlic.<>t-mcthods of communication in vogue
in Britain before it occurred to the Druidic inventors
that to write the hieroglyphs or pictures of the trees
themselves was a much more simple and effective
process, and we can scarcely doubt that from some
such mode of picture-writing the Bobileth alphabet
was later developed ; in any case the tree-names of
the alphabet are still preserved in the Keltic
languages of Britain.
Under Roman persecution the Druids disappeared
-or seemed to disappear. Says Strabo: " On
account of their evil sacrifices the Romans
endeavoured to destroy all the superstition of the
Druids, but in vain." The Druids were, indeed,
the protagonists of their country's Liberty, the patriots
of an island Keltic in its culture and sentiment, and
still preponcleratingly so, whatever may be said or
written to the contrary. They saw their beloved
isle invaded, torn, and despoiled by the crudest of
materialists, by men whose whole desire was to loot

believe that it is not improbable that the Druids
flourished for rt' ntm il!s as a cultus under the name
of Culdees. The Culdees are ge~tC'rall y supposed to
have been a cnste nf Christian pri£'sts or monks of
early British nrigin, unfriendly to Roman authority
and discipline. But there are many circumstances
connected with them which seem to show that, if
they practised a spec·ies of Christianity, their doctrine
still retained a large measure of the Druidic
philosophy, and that, indeed, they were the direct
descendants of the Druidic caste.
\Ve find the Culdees, previously to the arrival of
Augustine in 597, in various parts of England,
Scotland, and Irela11d, and they must have differed
in their views very considerably from the Roman
priesthood, els£' they would not have been persecuted
by them, as P.ede avC'rs. They married, and their
abbots held office by hereditary right, so that in
Armagh ll ftecn ~enerations held the episcopate
successively. They dwelt in colleges, practising
music as well as the mechanical arts. They cele-
brated Easter at a different period from the Roman
hierarchy, holding it a month before the Roman
festival. They shaved the head in a tonsure from
their foreheads backward, in the form of a crescent,
baptized infants l>y immersion, without the conse-
crated chrism, were opposed to the doctrine of the
real presence, and denied the worship of saints and
angels. They condemned the mass, paid no respect
to holy relics, and refused to offer up prayer;; for the
dead. In fact, anything less resembling Roman
practice than theirs can scarcely be imagined. Many
early Christian writers condemn the rudeness of their
forms of worship and the unauthorized character of
their ecclesiastical government. The second Council
of Chalons denounceci them as heretics in 813, and

Druidic forerunners of Columba. Under each of the
twelve pillars of one of the circular temples of lona,
according to Higgins, a human body was found to
have been buried.• Jarnieson remarks that the
Culdees succeeded the Druids in lona at no great
length of time. When Columba came to lona he
was opposed by one Broichan, a Druid, and
Odonellus relates that on the Saint's landing in the
island he was met by Druids, who disguised thent-
selves in the habits of f'lta'nks. They told him that
they had come there to preach the Gospel, but he
discovered the imposture, and they resigned the field
to him.•
All this tends to show that the Culdees, who dwelt
on lona and professed the rule of Columba, were
merely Christianized Druids, mingling with their
faith a large element of the ancient Druidic cultus.
The account of the coming of Columba in
Adamnan's life of the saint reveals very clearly that
he himseLf was not unacquainted with Druidic lore.
Indeed, he opposed the Druids with arts similar to
their own. In a striking passage Canon MacCulloch
observes:
Since Christian writers firmly believed in tile magical
powers of the Druids, aided, however, by the devil, they
taught that Christian saints had miraculously overcome
them with their own weapons. St. Patrick dispelled snow-
storms and darkness raised by Druids, or destroyed
Druids who had brought down fire from heaven. Similar
deeds arc attributed to St. Columba and others. The
moral victory of the Cross was later regarded also as a
magical victory. Hence also lives of Keltic saints are
full of miracles which are simply a reproduction of
Druidic magic-<:ontrolling the elements, healing, carry-
ing live coals without hurt, causing confusion by their
curses, producing invisihility or shape-shifting, making
the ice-cold waters of a river hot by standing iu them

at their devotions, or walking unscathed through the
fiercest storms. They were soon regarded as more expert
magicians than the Druids lhemselvcs. They may have
laid claim to magical powers, or perhaps they used a
natural shrewdness in such a way as to suggest magic.
But all their power they ascribed to Christ. "Christ is
my Druid"-the true miracle-worker, said St. Columba.
Yet they were imbued with the superstitions of their own
age. Thus St. Columba sent a white stone to King Brude
at Inverness for the cure of his Druid Broichan, who
drank the water poured over it and was healed. Soon
similar virtues were ascribed to the relics of the saints
themselves, and at a later time, when most Scotsmen
ceased to believe in the saints, they thought that the
ministers of the kirk had powers llke those of pagan
Druid and Catholic saint. Ministers were levitated, or
shone with a celestial light, or had clairvoyant gifts, or,
with dire results, cursed U1e ungodly or the benighted
prelatist. They prophesied, used trance-utterance, and
exercised gifts of healing. Angels ministered to them,
as when Samuel Rutherford, having fallen into a well
when a child, was pulled out by an angel. The sub-
stratum of primitive belief survives all changes of creed,
and the folk impartially attributed magical powers to
pagan Druid, Celtic saints, old crones and witches, and
Presbyterian ministers.•
Still, the people would not have believed these
things possible had not a large leaven of the old belief
survived. Indeed, its last echoes have not yet died
away, even in the great cities of Scotland, much less
in the Highlands and islands.
I think I have said enough to prove that Druidism
had not died out in Scotland at least in the sixth
century, and that is all I wish to do at the moment.
I might speak of Columba's magical war with the
Druids of Inverness, or oE the proof that Druids
survived in other districts of the North, but the above
evidence surely suffices.
The evidence of the survival of a Druid priesthood
in Ireland until comparatively late times is sufficiently
plentiful. In Erin they were not only the companions
I (\p. cit. pp. JJ I-2.
E
66 The Myste ri es of Britai n
but the tutors of the native kings and princes, and
they sat in judgement in criminal cases, as did the
filid , their descendants and successors. That they
had written records we know, [or King Loegaire
requested that the books of Saint P;,trick and those
of the Druids should both be subjected to the ordeal
by water to prove which were the more efficacious.
They were in the habit of baptizing children, and
of one hero it is told that they chantl'd the baptismal
rite over him as an infant. They also took part in
burial rites, and presided over the sacrifices which
were made at the entombment. T hey practised the
healing art, and of Cuchullin it was said that had
Fergus been ill " he would have taken no rest till he
had found a Druid able to discover the cause of that
illness' '. They are spoken of as wearing cloaks of
white, and in some cases as wearing bulls' hides,
presumably after sacrifice. They also wore a tonsure
which seems to have borne some relation to that used
later by the Culdees. The Irish texts appear to have
been re-edited with special rclation to the omission
of all material relating to the Druids, but in most
accounts of the salient occurrences in Irish history
they are referred to in such a manner as makes it
impossible to doubt their great influence in political
and public affairs. The Irish deities known as the
T uatha De Danann are alluded to as masters of
Druidic lore. Female Druids functioned as priest-
esses or guardians of the sacred fires at Kildare and
elsewhere, and to them Christian nuns duly
succeeded.
In the Irish popular tales and sagas Druidism is
mentioned so frequently as to prove beyond doubt
that it was the ancient religion of Erin. In these
"Druidism" stands for magic, and slat 1
1a draoichta
or "the rod of druidism" for the magic wand. Of
The Cult of t h e Dead 67
lheir feats in the mysterious arts the sagas are
"loquent. They flooded plains, produced blizzards
and fiery hail-storms, overcast mountains, and turned
slones imo armed men. They assumed what shapes
lhey pleased, or made others assume them. They
could cause forgetfulness by a magic draught, and
seem to have possessed hypnotic powers. Their
training included memorizing long incantations and
spells, and these descended to the filid, or poets, their
successors. The very earliest written records of
[reland refer to ''the Science of Goibniu'', a master
of Druidic magic, and to "the healing of Diancecht",
and these are to be found in manuscripts of the eighth
or ninth century still in use magically in Christian
limes.
"When we recall the fact," says Mr. Kendrick,
'' that there most certainly were important assemblies
held in Ireland, taking place at fixed intervals and
attended by delegates from distant parts, it will be
seen that we cannot fairly assume that Irish Druidism
lacked that co-ordination of its members such as
obtained in Gaul." And again : " It is significant
lhat the Druids of Ireland were servants of the
primitive Keltic festival-system m its central
European form.' '
The evidence for the existence of Druidism in
Wales is even more abundant, and exhibits more
positive proofs of the continuance of the cult in the
Principality until a relatively late date. There is
every reason to believe that on the arrival of the
Saxons and the consequent withdrawal of the Kelts
of South Britain to what is now called Wales, whence
large numbers of them certainly sought refuge, the
rult of Druidism found a haven among the Welsh
mountains. I am aware that several writers of
authority have questioned both the emigration and
68 Th e Mys teries of B rita in
the religious revival which accompanied it, but they
have done so not on acceptable historical evidence,
but on " reasonable" grounds alone. rlowever, no
arguments are reasonable which do not rest on solid
proof, and these certainly do not.
That Druidism did not die out in Wales after the
Roman period is clear enough, although the point has
been hotly contested. Not only do the Triads
conserve notices of its survival until at least the sixth
century of our era, but the memorials of folklore
prove it to have lasted much longer in a more or less
corrupted form. Indeed, the Bards of Wales pre-
tended to a knowledge of the mystical lore of the
Druids. The bard Gwalchmai (r 150-1190) says, in
his elegy on the death of Madog, Prince of Powys :
"Would to God the day of doom were arrived, since
Druids are come bringing the news of woe."
'vVe find the position of the llard laid down clearly
enough by Cynddelw, a contemporary of Gwalchmai,
in his panegyric on Owen Gwynedd, in which he
says :
1 1
Bards are constituted the judges of excel-
lence, and bards will praise thee, even Druids of the
circle, of four dialects, coming from the four regions."
Elsewhere in a poem recited at a poetic contest, he
speaks of "Druids of the splendid race, wearers of
the gold chains", as if they were still existing. In
another poem addressed to Owen Cyveilcawg, Prince
of Powys, he makes repeated mention of the Druids:
'
1
It is commanded by Druids of the land . . .
let songs be prepared' ', and in his elegy on the death
of Rhiryd, he calls himself "a bard of Keridwen,
the mystic goddess'' , and alludes to the poems of
T aliesin as follows : " From the mouth of T aliesin
is the Bardic mystery, concealed by the I3ards".
Llywarch ab Llewelyn (11 6o-12::!0) also alludes to
"the order of the primitive Bards" , and speaks of
T he CuIt o f t he Dead 69
tht· prophecies of the Druids as if they were his
•u11Lemporaries. Philip Brydydd, president of the
B.trcis (1200-1 250), alludes to the Bardic contests and
tn aspirants to the chair he holds, saying that none
111 the presence of the grave Druids of Britain could
.tspire to it without distinction in their art ; thus also
lll<'ntioning the Druids as his contemporaries.
There is, indeed, little doubt that some more or
l•·ss corrupted survival of Druidism was known in
Wales even so late as the thirteenth century, as we
·.hnll see in the ensuing chapters.
NO
TE: Davies in his Mythology of the British
I>mids' rather elaborately outlines the evidence for
the existence of Druidism in North Britain in the
·,ixth century A.D. In the story of Coli, " the great
111ystagogue" of Cornwall, he says, it is stated that
1hi<; magician gave to Brynach, prince of the
Northern Gwyddelians of Strathclyde, in Scotland,
,, present of the Eaglet which was deposited by the
"')'stical sow whose symbolical progeny was f:trrowed
ttmrly over the entire length of Britain. The young
,,f this eagle were the "two dusky birds of
I ;wcnddoleu, prince of the Strathclyde Britons, who
livnl about 593, and who was defeated and slain by
tilt' Saxon prince of Deira and Bernicia, the defeat
••f a Druidic prince and mystic, Davies believed, by
·' Christian Saxon ruler. Merlin, he states, was a
pt icst of Gwenddoleu, as is mentioned in the poem
t.tllcd "Avallenau", and to him the prince presented
,, hundred and forty-seven apple trees, which Davies
1hought were the mystical letters enshrining the
·,c•nNs of Druidism. " Gwenddoleu," he writes,
'' was the bead of an anl'ient Druidical establishment
"' North Britain."
Continuing his description of Merlin, he writes :
1 p. 462 ff.
70 The My s te rie s o [ Brita in
Merddin is styled supreme judge of the North; that is, of
the regions beyond the little kingdom of Strath Clwyd;
and the Syw, or diviner, of every region: and in virtue
of this office he was Cerddglud Clyd lliant, president
of Rardic lore, about the waters of Clyde. He was
companion of Ca11awo11 Cy11llaith, the olfspring of the
goddess of slaughter, whom Aneurin thus commemo-
rates, in the ),0flg's of the Gododin : '' If, in the banquet
of mead and wine, the Saxons sacrificed to Slaughter,
th<' mother of Spoliation ; the cncrg-c:tic Eidiol al!;o
honoured her before the mount, in the presence of the
god of victory, the king who rises in light, and ascends
the sky. " And this connection h ·tween the British
divinities of slaughter and victory is marked in the
character of l\lerddin, or Merlin, who is styled: All·wedtl
byddin Budd .\Ter-the key or intupreter o·f the army of
the god of victory.
He was the brother of Crtuc,uJclytltl Tl'cn, Ad/am
Cerddeu--the fair lady of the day, 1he refuge of Bardic
lore-a mythological character ; ancl this lady addresses
the venerable priest in the following terms: "Arise from
thy secret place, and unfold the hooks of the .4wc" ( Bardic
spirit), the object of general dread, and the speech of
Buu (Proserpine) and the visions of sleep."
These arc some o( tlu: cpmlific·:uion:-. of l\Ierddin, as
recorded by a Nortlzern, hut unknown Rard, who wrote
in his name and rharactcr about lh<' year 948. lie was
a supreme judge, a priest, and a prClphct- and he was
conversant in the mystl·rit•s of the very same divinities,
Cvnllaith, Budd, Awcn, and /~ rm, which were revered at
the great temple of Stonehenge.
Stephens, however, in his Literature of the
K ymry' does not believe these poems to be earlier
than the reign of Owen Gwynedd ( 1 16o), and points
to a circumstance of anachronism in that the poet has
made ~1 erlin a devout Christian! It is difficult,
therefore, to regard this "cvirlence" seriously, and
it is only given here for the sake of completeness.
At the same timP it is certainly partially authenti-
cated by other more trustworthy MSS., and there
can be no doubt that Druidism did survive in the
Cymric portion of Southern Scotland for centuries.

CHAPTER III
THE MYSTERY OF KELTIC PHILOSOPHY
ril E mystery of Keltic thought has been the despair
••I g-enerations of philosophers and <esthetes. The
.ldmte concerning it has been scarcely less amazing
111 its vehemence than that other and allied contro-
\-c-rsy on the origin of the Keltic race. Renan and
1\rnold manifestly wrestled with it much in the same
primiti ve manner as the astrologers of Chaldea strove
with the science of the stars. But an abyss so
t•rofound is scarcely to be plumbed by the discern-
ll wnt of the polite essayist, or measured by the logical
t•rO<·csses of the student of Comparative Religion.
l1 is a task for the prophet or the seer, for a Blake
••I a Brahan Seer. To the man who has no magic
111 his blood the cavern o£ Keltic profundity is for ever
•,c·aled. H e who approaches it must, I feel, not
.tlnnc be of the ancient stock of the first culture-
''' ingers of this island, but he must also have heard
··1 11cc childhood the deep and repeated call of ancestral
'11iccs urging him to the task of the exploration of
11... mysteries of his people.
The Kelts, that race of artists, poets, and aristo-
' l .tls, appear originally to have formed themselves
111111 n nation in the region betwixt France and
llungary, in all likelihood in the South German plain
lwtween Switzerland and Bohemia, and probably
d•:vl"lnped slowly as a nation from a race known as
1lw "Urn-Field people", a Bronze Age folk. In
1lw course of generations they became welded into
71
72 T he l\t y s t e r i c s o r B r i ta i n
a natioo, and as such they wf>re known tn the
Greeks at leac;t 500 yf>ars before our l' ra , their
cou•nry being spoken of by H ellenic writers as
Keltica. They introduced the iron civilization of La
T ene into Gaul and Britain, anu in doing so mingled
with races of older occupancy. losing- S(Jme of their
racial t'haracteristics in the prorcss, perhaps. But
their t·ultw-al and resthetic oullook, their pec-uliar
philosophy, they did not lose, notw ith~tanding that
this must have been pow\!rfully nfTectcu by the beliefs
and customs of the peoples with whom they inter-
mixed, so that even to-day, although the name Kelt
is rather confusedly applieu to mixed races of almost
wholly different physical appearance, to Welsh, Irish,
Scots, and Bretons alike , there still remains among
these dissimilar types a mental habitude and a
simibrity of opinion and outlook which reveal the
previous existence of a common philosophy and a
common tradition.
The Kelt, tall or short, lo11g-- or round-skulled,
dark, fair or rufous, is nevcnhelcss scarcely to be
mistaken so far as his mental qualities are concerned.
H e was labelled by the older School of Anthro-
pologists, by Broca, and others, as ' 'sanguine-
bilious", and one can see no good reason to doubt
or discard the psychological diagnosis. H e reveals
himself normally as a man frequently gloomy and
irritable, prone to the sudden illumination of
enthusiasm, a man of prolonged silences, suddenly
garrulous, dreamy, but passing £rom repose to violent
but usually short-lived action. Conservative and
superstitious, fatalist, fearless, he is all these things.
Yet he is as various individualJy as the men of other
races, in some cases highly emotional, in others
strangely passive. In all probability the general type
of man we now call the Kelt displays the several
M y s t er y o f K el t i c Ph i1o s op h y 73
1' ., 1 hological facets of the various races with whom
Ill'. primal stock originally mingled, and, according
111 tltt: law of miscegenation, these assume a different
lurm with each individual, as he throws back to
II wrian, Teutonic, or other ancestors. But, despite
tl11· intermixture, the ancient leaven of Kelticism
ttuunphs and the peculiar genius of the ancient race
•.trong because so ancient and so perfectly moulded
111 the matrix of its origin-shines with an almost
'•lllll-rhuman radiance through the veils of alien
' ltaracter or idiosyncracy which in some cases even
•.t'l'lll at first sight to have obliterated it. One must
,,llcn wait long and patiently to behold the illumina-
ttcttl. But some day under stress of passion or triumph
' "' sorrow it will manifest itself in such a way that it
t .u11tot be mistaken, in the sad, low, characteristic
l.tllg'h, the gloomy and ominous scowl, in a quick
··•c:t~peration and fierce resentment which will surprise
'w :lmuse men of slower blood, or in the proud and
h.aughty scorn to which the finer and more purely-
J,,.·tJ scions of this race of Europe's aristocrats are
·,u disconcertingly prone.
What is the mystical secret of the Kelt, poet,
1•rophet, warrior, aristocrat among aristocrats? It is
tlw memory, the soul-recollection of a former moral
" ttd intellectual pre-eminence which he has not lost,
l• •r its gifts remain within him, but the arcanum of
which he cannot discover. H e is like a man with a
' lwst of treasure who has lost the key.
la1 this repository lie the Books of the Secrets of
Hritain , those most ancient and mysterious volumes
•ttntaining the lore of the civilizing race of this island
111 its pristine days. The secrets it holds are of
tllc·o.;timable spiritual concern and importance to the
1••·t~plt~ of a land still overwhelmingly Keltic in
thought and character. T hat Britain, to which the
74 Th e Mys t e ries of Britai n
whole world looks for guidance in science and political
thought, which governs almost one quarter of the
globe, which has achievetl triumphs unparalleled in
the fields of scholarship, invention, and government,
whose light burns above those of all nations, should
yet not be enabled to boast a native mysticism of her
own, but be compelled to borrow from Eastern
sources to supply this deficiency, is humiliating
indeed. It is not that that native mystical tradition
does not exist. It lies almost undisturbed in the
cavern of the Keltic past, whence it is still possible to
regain it for the behoof of our race.
T he first task before us in seeking to recover the
secret of the Keltic Grail is, naturally, to review
briefly the material, documentary and otherwise,
which may help us to a just understanding of the
mystical literature of the British Kelt. It is from
this and from the relics of early British faith and
philosophy as evinced in popular rites of immemorial
tradition that we hope to glean the broken sherds of
the vessel of British native mysticism, and to piece
them into a recovered and restored whole.
The mystical and occult literature of the Brythonic
Kelts of South Britain is partly derived from the
collection of tales known as the Mabinogion,
whjch, though existing in a MS. of the fourteenth
century, was obviously composed at a much earlier
date, as its mythological character proves. The
Welsh T riads likewise enshrine similar material,
dating, probably, from the twelfth century, but
embalming mystical lore greatly more ancient. The
so-called Book of Taliesin, written, or more probably
re-written, at some time during the fifteenth century, is
on the same footing. The many efforts to disprove the
authentic and ancient character of the mythological
material contained in these MSS. have signally
M y s t e r y of Ke 1tic Phi Ioso p hy 75
l.ul<'cl. made as they were by literary persons for the
11111SL part unacquainted with mythological science.
The question of the survival of Druidical know-
l.·d~e in the bardic poetry of Wales is one which has
J.,.,.n debated with unusual heat. One of the earliest
t•rntagonists of the theory of its continuity was the
1\c·v. Edward Davies, who, in his Mythology of tlze
II' itislz Dmids, uncompromisingly and whole-
lwartedly addressed himself to its affirmation. It has
llf'cn proved amply enough by Nash and others' that
lu . translations of the ancient Welsh poems were
·••mcwhat inexact and garbled1 and that his mytho-
lc •gital notions of the existence of a '' Helio-Arkite''
H·lig-ion in \Vales until a late date were sufficiently
.•h-.urd. But as the "translations" of his critics were
··q11.tlly bad and their views equally unsound, allow-
Hu'l's must be made for him. His theories were
lwthcr elaborated by the H on. Algernon Herbert in
lu·, anonymous works : Brilmlllia after tlze Roma1lS
(c S.~6) and T1ze Neo-Druidic Heresy (1838), in
wlti('h he gave it as his belief that the adherence to
llw nld paganism of the Druids had caused a schism
"' the British Church, and encouraged the mainten-
...., •. of a Nco-Druidic heresy therein.
('heir opponents indicated not only that the
"'·' jority of their translations were inexact, but that
'"·Ill)' of the passages believed to be of a mystical
"' 111ythological nature were in reality of Christian
"")!in. But in doing so, they went too far-as far,
•n·h·ecl, as Davies and Herbert had gone in the other
oluc·r·tion. The truth is that when the \Velsh poems
111 l'lze Book of Taliesi'n, The Red Book of H ergest,
/'ltc· Dlrtck Book of Caenllartlzcn, and in the tales
111 the' 1\lahinogion are si[ted and examined

and mythological material not to be accounted for by
the methods of their critics.
These were not practical mythologists or mystics,
and most of them (Nash, in particular, as Skene has
shown) had a very short way of dismissing evidence
which ran counter to their ideas. They stressed the
notion that the bards of Wales, Taliesin, Llywarch
H en, and Aneurin referred to the deities of ancient
Britain resthetically, as might the Augustan poets to
the gods of classical mythology. But the direct and
personal manner in which the allusions are often made
renders such an idea quite untenable.
Moreover, as will be shown , there is nothing
inherently impossible in the idea that the ancient
British religion and mysticism lingered in Wales and
other distant parts of the island for many centuries
after the departure of the Romans. Those who
adopt the negative positive have to explain the
presence of hundreds of surviving superstitions in
Britain at the present time, the burning of a W elsh
Druidic idol along with its priest in London in the
reign of H enry VIII , the comparatively recent
sacrifice of bulls in the Highlands of Scotland in
connection with primitive rites, the existence of such
celebrations as the worship of Shoney in the North
of Scotland, and many other similar festivals which
will be adduced in their proper place, the late
observance of witchcraft, a broken-down survival of
Iberian-Keltic religion, a
-nd a host of other evidences.
They have also to account satisfactorily for the
survival of antique faiths elsewhere in lands where
paganism has, to all intents, seemingly been rooted
N il for centuries, for 1hc Nagualism of Mexico and
Central Aam"rica for the Antiche Religionc or the
worship of Diana in modern Italy, and for similar
beliefs and practices in the Balkans and Russia.

•h• \' cnntain, it will be well to summarize briefly such
utllltllt:ttion as we possess regarding the principal
dl\ lllitit·s of whom these tales and poems recount the
'"' •·ttrmes. Some of them have been identified with
d11 )!'"Is of the Gaels, but the majority of them have

,,, ••.tv, however, that they are of both Brythonic and
( .. ...l,·li.. nrigin, the results of a mingling of beliefs and

l lw first group to attract our attention , and
I" t!t. tp·~ the most outstanding, is that oE Llyr, as

t....llwrs Nissyen and Evanissyen are recounted in

of the hereafter, or rather the underworld of fertility,
as is his sister llranwen, as her possession of a magic
cauldron reveals.
The children of Don, another Brythonic group,
are Gwyclion, Gilvrethwy, Amrethon, Govannon, and
Arianrhod, w~h her sons Dylan and Llew. They
resemble the Irish Tuatha De D anaan, and their
adventures are described in the mabinogi of Math,
which recounts the passion of Gilvrethwy for Math's
handmaiden Goewin, and the manner in which
Gwydion procw-es the magical swine of Pryderi,
which had been gifted him by Arawn Lord of Annwn
or Hades. Math is obviously a territorial and
local god of Gwynedd in vVaJes, a magician pa·r
excellence, a "god of Druidism". Gwydion is the
patron of poetry, divination, and prophecy, the ideal
bard, as well as a philosopher and culture-bringer.
Amrethon is a husbandman, and Govannon a
"smith" or artificer, a species of Keltic Vulcan.
Arianrhod, or "Silver Wheel", represented the
constellation Corona Borealis, but is also associated
with the earth's fertility.
Another group found in the Mabinogion is that of
Pwyll, Prince of D yved, his wife Rhiannon, and
their son Pryderi. Pwyll changes places for a year
with Arawn, King of Annwn, or H ades, and makes
war on his rival H avgan. Still another group is that
of Beli and his sons Llud, Caswallawn, and Llevelys.
In The B ook of Taliesin we encounter a group still
more important from the mystical point of view, that
of Keridwen, her hideous son Avagddu, his sister
Creirwy, and his brother Morvran. So that
Avagddu, the ugly, may be compensated by the
possession of supernatural knowledge, Keridwen
prepares a cauldron of inspiration which must be
brewed for a year, and which will produce three

Mystery oi Keltic Philosophy 79
drnps of divine fluid. She sets a servant, Gwion,
In watch it, and the three drops falling on his finger,
l•c conveys it to his mouth and becomes inspired.
Keridwen, in her anger, pursues him, and as he
.tssumes various forms, a hare, a fish, and a grain
uf wheat, in his flight, she takes on the shape of a
greyhound, an otter, and at last a hen, in which guise
she swaUows the grain, later bearing Gwion as a
child, whom she abandons to the sea in a coracle.
As we shall see, this myth is aU-important to an
understanding of British mystical lore. The child
she abandons to the waves becomes, later, Taliesin,
the magical bard.
The Druidic bards who lived and sang under the
Welsh princes unanimously represent Keridwen as
presiding over the hidden mysteries of their ancient
cult. Cynddelw, who flourished about the middle
of the twelfth century, sings: '' H ow mysterious
were the ways of the songs of Keridwen! How
necessary to understand them in their true sense!"
Llywarch ap Llywelyn, who wrote between 1 t6o
and I 220, asks for "inspiration as if it were from
the Cauldron of Keridwen'', and says that he will
address his lord "with the dowry of Keridwen, the
Ruler of Bardism". It was essential for those bards
who aspired to the Chair of Song to have tasted the
waters of inspiration from her cauldron, to have been
initiated into her mysteries. That the myth of
Keridwen of the Lake of Tegid, the god or genius
of which was the husband of this deity, is all-
important in our quest may be gathered from a
passage in The Book of Taliesin.
Then she (Keridwen) determined, agreeably to the mys-
tery of the books of Pheryllt, to prepare for her son a
cauldron of water of inspiration and knowledge. . . .
In the meantime Keridwen, with due attention to the
books of astronomy, and to the hours of the planets,
80 The Mysteri es o[ Britain
employed herself daily in collecting plants of every species,
which preserved any rare virtues. . . . She stationed
Gwion the Little, the son of Gwrcany the Herald of
Llaovair, in Powys, the land of rest, lo superintend the
preparation of the cauldron.
The Pheryllt, according to whose ritual she pro-
ceeded, are frequently mentioned by the bards of
Wales, and an old chronicle, quoted by Dr. Thomas
Williams, states that the Pheryllt had a college at
Oxford prior to the foundation of that University.
These Pheryllt appear to have been a section of the
Druidic brotherhood, teachers and scientists, skilled
in all that required the agency of fire, hence the name
has frequently been translated "alchemists" or
''metallurgists''. Indeed, chemistry and metallurgy
are known as Celvyddydan Pheryllt, or "the arts of
the Pheryllt", who would seem to have had as their
headquarters the city of Emrys in the district of
Snowdon, famous for its magical associations, the
city of the dragons of Beli.•
Somewhere in the district of Snowdon lie the
remains of this ancient British city of Emrys, or "the
ambrosial city", also known in Welsh tradition as
the city of Dinas Affaraon, or "the higher powers".
To this mysterious community the poems of the
Welsh bards allude so frequently as to place its actual
existence beyond all question. Not only is it men-
tioned in The Black Book of Caermartllen and other
Cymric manuscripts as the centre of mystical rites,
but it is alluded to by one of Camden's commentators
as occupying the summit of " the panting cliff" on
Snowdon itself. Davies says that it stood "upon
the road from the promontory of Lleyn to that part
of the coast which is opposite Mona" (Anglesey),
and Gibson, in his work on Camden, identifies it
with the ruins of an exceedingly strong fortification
• Myvyrian ilrclaa:ology, II, p. 59·
M y s t e r y o f K e l tic P h i l os o p h y 81
••rwompassed by a triple wall on an eminence called
Broich y Ddinas, "the ridge of the city", which
lorms part of the summit of Penmaen. Within each
w.tll the foundation of at least a hundred towers of
.d,out six yards' diameter remain, and the defences
dacmselves were at least six feet in thickness. " The
greatness of this work," he says, "shows that it was
.r princely fortification, strengthened by Nature and
workmanship. seated on the top of one of the highest
mountains of that part of Snowdon which lie toward
the sea."
Jn Emrys were concealed in the time of Bile the
·.nlar deity, and in the time of Prydain the son of
tE dd the Great, the dragons which are so frequently
rc•ferred to as harnessed to the car of Keridwen, so
11 appears not improbable that the city was in some
manner associated with her mysteries. Davies
believed that the PheryUt were priests of those
111ysteries in the ambrosial city of Emrys.
Now what, precisely, is the significance of the
goddess Keridwen and her mystical cauldron?
Mythically speaking, the vessel in question was
designed for the preparation of a brew which induceJ
inspiration and awoke the prophetic and bardic facul-
ties. T he myth is obviously an allegory of initiation,
nf which the tasting of the water was an essential rite.
In the poem known as "The Chair of T aliesin"
in The Book of Taliesin (No. XIII) a number of
ingredients arc enumerated which went to compose
the mystical elixir brewed in the Cauldron of
K<'ridwen, the Pair Pumwydd, the " Cauldron of the
Five T rees", so-called in allusion to the five
particular trees or plants requisite to the preparation.
CNtain Cymric legends represent this Pair as a bath,
tlw water of which conferred immortality, but
dq u·ivcd the bather of utterance-an allusion,
F
82 T h e My s t e r ie s o f B r i t a i n
perhaps , to the oath of secrecy administered prior to
Initiation. Elsewhere Taliesin alludes to it as ''the
Cauldron of the ruler of the deep'', and states that
it will not boil the food of him who is not bound by
his oath.
It is thus dear enough that the Welsh Bards made
use in their initiatory rites of a decoction of plants
or herbs which they believed could bestow certain
powers of inspiration, eloquence, prophecy, and song
upon the votary who partook of it. The use of such
purificatory or lustrational water was not unknown
in the mysteries of Greece and Rome. In connection
with the mysteries of Ceres a decoction of laurel,
salt, barley, sea-water, and crowns of flowers was
employed, and this appears as similar to the
ingredients of Keridwen's cauldron, which, according
to T aliesin, contained berries, the foam of the ocean,
cresses, wort and vervain which had been borne aloft
and kept apart from the influence of the moon. A
part of this potion was also added to the Gwin, or
Bragwod, or sacred drink used commonly by the
British initiates, which was made from wine, honey,
water, and malt, and which thus resembles the liquor
of the devotees of Ceres, a concoction of wine, barley,
water, and meal.
The residue of the water in the cauldron of
Keridwen was, as we have seen, poisonous and
accursed, that is, it was symbolically supposed to
contain the sins and pollutions of the novitiates, and
was cast out, precisely as was the residue of the water
employed in the mysteries of Ceres.'
The mysterious cauldron is alluded to by Taliesin
as having been instituted by nine maidens who
"warmed it with Lheir breath". Davies• believes
r AthCPIO!US, Lib. XI, Ch. rs.
, B ritish Druids, p. 223.
Mystery o f Ke lti c Philo s o ph y 83
them to have been the Gwyllion, or "fairies",
l'rophetic damsels who bore a resemblance to the nine
muses of classical lore. They are mentioned by
Taliesin as preparing their cauldron in a "quad-
rangular caer" or sanctuary in " the island of the
strong door". This seems to refer to the island of
Seon mentioned in the same poem, and which must
surely be one and the same with the Sena or lie de
Sein, not far from Brest, mentioned by Pomponius
Mela' as the "abode of priestesses holy in perpetual
virginity, and nine in number. They are," he pro-
ceeds, '' called Gallicenre, and are thought to be
endowed with singular powers. By their charms
they are able to raise the winds and seas, to turn
themselves into what animals they will, to cure
wounds and diseases incurable by others, to know
and predict the future." In a word, they were
Druidesses, as modern authorities have admitted.
Once a year they unroofed their temple, and if, in
the task of re-thatching it, one of them stumbled,
she was immediately torn in pieces by the others.
Strabo likewise mentions these priestesses of Sena
as the devotees of '' Bacchus'', ''possessed of
Dionysius''. This is, of course, merely another way
of saying that these women were the hierophants of
a Keltic deity whose rites and mysteries resembled
those of Bacchus, the orgiastic celebrations which
preceded the deity's gifts of inspiration and prophecy.
M. Salmon Reinach dismisses the stories of Strabo
and Mela as a fable based on the myth of Circe, but,
as Canon MacCulloch reasonably remarks, '' even if
they are garbled, they seem to be based on actual
observation and are paralleled from other regions.
The facts that the rites were called
Dionysiac is no reason for denying the fact that some
' op. cit. p. 3'7·
84 The Mys teries of Britain
orgiastic rites were practised. Classical writers
usually reported all barbaric rites in terms of their
own religion."• Says Mr. Kendrick: " Although
it is quite possible the autho1·s were tempted to
interpret the reputed existence nf Keltic island-
communication in the terms of classical mythology,
with its tales of the Isle of Circe and so on, yet, since
there is abundant evidence that the Gauls, like many
other ancient peoples, felt that some peculiar holiness
was attached to lonely islands, it is almost an
inevitable consequence that the quality of sacredness
should be translated to those who lived upon
them.''
It is obviously to some such orgiastic ceremony
that the bard Aneurin alludes in a poem cited by
Davies.•
In the presence of the hlessed ones, before the great
assembly, before the occupier~ of the hoime, when the
house was recovered from the sw:unp, surrounded with
crooked horns and crooked swords, in honour of the
mig hty king of the plains, thr king with open counten-
ance : 1 saw dark {!ore MisinK on the stalks of plants, on
the clasp of the chain, on the bunches on the sovereign,
on the bush and spear. Ruddy was the sea-beach, whilst
the circular revolution was performed by the attendants,
and the white hands, in graceful extravagance.
The assembled train were dancing, after the manner,
and singing in cadence, with g arlands on their brows ;
loud was the clattering of shield!' round the ancient
cauldron in frantic mirth, and lively was the aspect of
him, who, in his prowess, had :matched over the ford that
involved baU which cast its rays to a distance, the splendid
product of the adder, shot forth by serpents.
But wounded art thou, scvcrelv wounded, thou
delight of princesses, thou who lovcdsl the living herd!

lo view of the sea. in the front of the assembled men,
and near the pit of conflict, the raven has pierced thee in

That these Oruidesses of Sena were identified
with the nine guardians of the Cauldron of Keridwen,
~hows that Lhey were the hereditary priestesses of
her cull, like the priestesses of Galatian Artemis or
the goddesses of Gaul with their female votaries. But
the allusion of Anew·in to the "involved b<1ll"
introduces us to another phase of the Keltic
mysteries.
T he ball in question is, of course, the celebrated
serpent's egg of Druidic lore. The lows classicus
of its allusion is the well-known statement of Pliny'
who says of it :
There is also anOLher kind of egg, of much renown in
the Gallic provinces, but ignored by the Greeks. In the
summer, numberless snakes entwine themselves into a
hall, held together by a secretion from their bodies and
by the spittle. This is called anguim11n. The Druids
say that his:.ing serpents throw this up into the air, and
that it must be caught in a cloak, and not allowed to
touch the ground; and that one must instantly take to
night on horseback, as the serpents will pursue until some
:.tream cuts them otT. It may be tested, they say, by
seeing if it floats against the current of a river, even
though it be set in gold. But as it is the way of magicians
to cast a cunning veil about their frauds, they pretend
that these egg:. can only be taken on a certain day of
the moon, as though it rested with mankind to make the
moon and the serpents accord as to the moment of the
operation. I myself, however, have seen one of these
eggs; it was round, and about as large as a smallish
apple; the shell was cartalaginous, and pocked like the
arms of a polypu!-.. The Druid!> esteem it highly. It is
!>aid to ensure succ~s in lawsuits and a favourable recep-
tion with princes; but this is false, hecause a man of the

1hat reason alone.

86 Th e Mys te r ies o f Bri ta in
Regarding the precise nature of this "snakes'
egg' ' there is considerable conflict of opinion.
Certain prehistoric beads of blue and green glass,
sometimes carved and inlaid with white paste, are
known in Cornwall, \Vales, and Scotland as "snake-
stones" and in Ireland as "Druids' Glass." These
appear to date from the early centuries before the
Christian era, and, as the Druids must have been
familiar with them, it is improbable that they would
have regarded them as natural formations. Nor do
they fit in with the description of Pliny, who
represents the anguinwm as about the size of an apple,
and its shell or husk as horny.
Some authorities believe the "serpent's egg" to
have been a fossil echidnus or ammonite. But when
we recall the circumstance that the Druids were
known to the Welsh bards as Nadd1·ed, or Adders,
in allusion probably to their supposed regeneration as
initiates, an allegorical reference to the serpent which
casts its skin, it will be sc>en that the statement of
Pliny is merely a confused account of the manner in
which the Druids or " Adders" assembled and
manufactured these emblems, which were probably
glass balls covered with skin , and known to the
Kymry as Glei11iau N ad·redd. T hat they were
supposed to ensure good fortune in Lawsuits seems
to indicate their probable significance as amulets
radiating " rightness" or justice, and perhaps bestow-
ing eloquence in advocacy.
We now approach another and most important
avenue of possible proof that the philosophic ideas
of the Druids actually did survive in Wales
by the aid of the Bards. In the first place it
may be interesting, if nothing more, to quote
from the "Advertisement" oE Poems, Lyrical
and Pastoral. published in 1794, by Edward
M y s t e r y o f KeIt i c Ph iIo s ophy 87
Williams, who afterwards edited the Myvyrian
A rchreology.
He maintained fsays Skene•] that there had existed at
an early period, when bardism flourished as an institution
of the country, four chairs or schools of bards, and that
one of these chairs still remained-the chatr of Glamorgan
that the succession of bards and bardic presidents
could be traced back to 1300 that Llywelyn Sion,
who was bardic president in 1580 and died in 1616, had
reduced this system to writing under the title of the Book
of Ba.rdism, or the Dnudism of the Bards of the Isle of
Britain, which he professed to have compiled from old
books in the collection of MSS. at Raglan Castle.
The ''Advertisement'' is as follows :
The patriarchal religion of Ancient Britain, called
Druidism, but by the Welsh most commonly Barddas,
Bardism, though they also term it Derwyddoniaeth, Druid-
ism, is no more inimical to Christianity than the religion
of Noah, Job, or Abraham; it has never, as some imagine,
been quite extinct in Britain; the \Velsh Bards have,
through all ages down to the present, kept it alive.
There is in my possession a manuscript synopsis of it
by Llewelyn Sion, a Bard, written about the year 156o:
its truth and accuracy are cot-roboratcd by innumerable
notices and allusions in our Bardic manuscripts of every
age up to T aliesin in the sixth century, whose poems
exhibit a complete system of Druidism. By these
(undoubtedly authentic) writings it will appear that the
Ancient British Christianity was strongly tinctured with
Druidism.
Sharon T urner, the celebrated antiquary,
addressed himself to the consideration of Williams's
presentation of Sian's work, and wrote:
These triads, of course, only prove that the bards of
the middle ages had these notions, but it is highly prob-
able that what they believed on this point they derived
from their ancestors.
They mention three circles of eJtistence :-1, The
Cylcl• y Cengant, or all-enclosing circle, which contains
the Deity alone. 2, The circle of Gwym~ydd or F elicity,
the abode of good men wbo have passed through their
• Fo11r Ancient Hooks of Wales, I, 29.
88 Th e M ys t e ries of Britain
terrestrial changes. 3, The circle of Al•red or Evil, that
in which mankind p:t!-s through tlwir v:11 iou-. :-.tnge-; of
existence I.Jcfon• !Jcing qu:~li6cd to enter the 1 ircl.: of
felicity.
All animated beings have three stages of existence
to pass through-the state of Abrec/ or evil, in Anuwn or
the Great Deep ; the state of freedom in the human form,
and the state of love, which is happiness in the N cf or
heaven. All beings l>ut \.od must undergo three an~:eu
or necessities; they must have a beginning in A IIII'Wtl or
the great deep, a progression in A bred or the state of
evil, and a completion in the circle of felicity in heaven.
ln passing through the changes of being, attached
to the state of Abred, it is possible for mao by misconduct
to fall retrograde into the lowest state from which he had
emerged. There are three things which will inevitably
plunge him back into the changes of Abred-1, Pride;
for this he will fall to Annwn, which is the lowest point
at which existence begins. z, Falsehood, which will
re-pluoge him in ObYyn, or a transmigration into some
degrading form. 3, Cruelty, which will consign him to
Cydvil, or a transmigration into some ferocious beast.
F rom these he must proceed again in due course through
changes of being, up to humanity.
Humanity was the limit of degrading transmigra-
tions; all the changes above humanity were felicitating,
and they were to be perpetual, with ever-increasing acqui-
sitions of knowledge and happiness.
Now Nash, as he is bound to do in view of his
thesis of the dubious character of all Welsh Bardic
literature, tries to throw cold water upon the authentic
nature of Sian's writings. He says:
The MS. of Llywelyn Sion was, according to the state-
ment of Dr. Owen Pughe, last transcribed and revised by
Edward Davydd of Margam, who died in r6<)o. The
latter says, in his preface, th:u he compiled it from the
books of bards and learned teachers, lest the materials
should become lost, and more particularly from the hook:>
of Meyrig Davydd, Davydd Llwyd Mathew, Davydd
Benwyn, and Llywelyn Sion, who were ilardic presidents
of the Ciamorgan chair from 156o to 'sSo.
Llywelyn Sion, who died in r6 t6, says that the authors,
teachers, and judges, who sanctioned this sy!:ttCm and
code, were the Druids nnd lhrcis aft('r th"Y haci come
to the faith in Christ.
M y s t e r y o ( K e Iti c P h i l o sop h y 89
'' The original manuscript of Edward Davydd is
(" •nk Turnf'r in r ~n3) yet ext:"~m in the librarr of
l.lau Haran, in Glamorganshire."
What, one asks, is there of the improbable in all
this? " It docs not follow," says Skene, " because
the poems are not what Davies and Herbert
n·present them to be that they are therefore not
gt·nuine." Have the literatures of other countries
n ell Leen handed down by means more devious than
we find recorded by Sion? What of the Central
American " Popol Vuh ", the Kabbala, the
Scriptures themselves, the works of the classical era?
t\re the evidences of their antiquity in manuscript
II bl It~
<tny more respecta e .
And did Llywelyn Sian actually invent the mystic
rydes of which he speaks? If he did, it is surprising
that they so closely resemble those of other myth-
••logies, and that one of these cycles at least is
mentioned in several of the old lays and in the
Mab·inogion. It seems to me, indeed, highly
improbable that Sion '·'invented" this mystical
progression for the following reasons : (1) That, as
I shall show later, it agrees with the circumstances of
other and similar systems ; (2) that similar mystical
cosmologies have come down to us unimpaired Erom
:ln even greater antiquity than we are here dealing
with; and (3) that the system bears the impress of
authority and tradition on the face of it.
But Davies, the extreme protagonist of Nee-
Druidism, would have none of Sion•s system, and
allributed a later French origin to it. " It is not, "
he says, "the Druidism of History, or of the British
Bards." In this estimate Nash agrees with him.
But he seems to have been carried away by the fact
that Edward Williams's son, Taliesin Williams,
published a version of the Book of Bardism which
90 Th e Mys t e ries of Britain
did not contain any reference to the mysteries , and
that the Book containing the material of Sion
remained unpublished at the time of Edward
Williams's death, although it was later published,
under the title of Barddas, for the Welsh Society
in d~62.
Before dealing with the exLraordinary material
contained in Barddas-material which entirely
shatters the contentions of rhe critics of the authentic
character n£ the Druidic tradition in Wales-let me
remark that it ic; amazing to a modern student of
myth and folklore that the antagonists of the Bardic
and Druidic tradition should have utterly denied the
mythological authenticity of many of the poems and
even of the incidents in the Mabinogiott. These are
now, especially the latter, fully recognized by
standard authorities a~ the veritable remains of
Brythonic myth. And if the mythology of the Keltic
race, whose priests were the Druids, should have
been handed down almost unimpaired, why may not
the philosophy of the Druids have been preserved hy
similar means? That this was actually achieved I
hope to demonstrate in the succeeding chapter.
CHAPTER IV
''BARDDAS' '
' ' 8ARDDAS," the volume containing the material the
rxistence of whjch Nash had denied, was published
under the auspices of the W elsh Manuscript Society
.\l Llandovery in I 862, with translations and notes by
the Rev. J. Williams ab lthel, rector of Llanyo-
mowddwy, l\lerionethshire. In its title it purported
to be '' a collection of original documents illustrative
of the theology, wisdom and usages of the Bardo-
1lruidic system of the Isle of Britain.' '•
In the _
preface it is stated that the promoters of
the National Eisteddfod held at Llangollen in 1858,
desirous of rescuing the traditions of the bards from
llblivion, offered a prize for " the fullest illustration
from original sources of the theology, discipline and
u<;ages of the Bardo-Druidic system of the Isle of
Britain." Only one composition was received,
hearing the anonymous signature of " Plennydd."
With respect to its authenticity, the judges stated
1hat the manuscripts it contained were genuine,
" though their authors cannot in many instances be
named, any more than we can name the authors of
the Common Law of England, yet the existence of
the peculiar dogmas and usages which they represent
may be proved from the compositions of the Bards,
from the era of T aliesin down to the present time
. it is among the remains of Bardism
we may hope to discover, if at all, that Golden

Key, concealed and secured, which can open the
mysteries or esoteric doctrine of ancient nations.''
With few exceptions, we are told, the documents
included in the collection were gathered from the
manuscripts of the late lolo Morganwg, frequently
mentioned in the preceding chapter as Edward
Williams. They were in his handwriting, and the
judges had every reason to believe that they were
transcripts [rom older manuscripts. He made them
in the first instance on the backs of old letters and
bills, in which state they were discovered after his
death. The Editor, writing of these, says: "We
have had an opportunity of examining fully and
carefully those papers and unhesitatingly
pronounce him to be incapable of perpetrating literary
deceit or forgery." lndeed, the style is in general
too archaic for the eighteenth century, and it appears
that lolo .l\lorganwg himself did not fully understand
certain of the documents, nor did he correct the errors
they obviously contained. It is cle.:"lr, too, that in
making his transcripts he had frequently more than
one original to found upon, and the lack of uniformity
in some of the demils conclusively proves that he was
merely a copyist and nothing more.
Again, he refers to the actual existence of some of
the documents which he has copied, and gives with
great minuteness the names and addresses o[ the
owners. H e further states : "The Triades that are
here selected are from a manuscript collection by

late i\Tr. John Bradford, who, for <>kill in ancient
British Bardism, left not his equal behind." This

lwfore the publication of Barddas and was printed
111 Williams's Poems , Lyrical and Pa.stoml already
.dluded to. Had the reference been a false one it
'' nuld certainly have heen refuted at the time.
Other critics attempted to refer the material of
Harddas to the Eisteddvoddau held subsequently
1
0 the beginning of the fifteenth century, when cerfain
hardic rites were authorized which were handed
down through the medium of the bardic chair of
C~lamorgan. These were said to be the invention
uf the bards of the fifteenth, sixteenth and
·.cventeenth centuries, simply because the code had
not been reduced to writing before their time. Some
anually said that they derived it from the Brahmins
nf India ! This notwithstanding, it bears the stamp
nf authenticity in every line, and that it could have
been " invented" by Welsh bards who lived centuries
apart and had not a scintilla of knowledge regarding
lhahminism or any other esoteric religion is a
~uggestion of the most jejune description. Indeed,
one is forced to agree with the editor of Barddas
when he says : " We believe that the bards of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were, to some
('Xtent, acquainted with the poetical productions of
their predecessors," even if they did not agree upon
any system drawn from their writings. Many
passages in the volume may be paralleled &om the
works of the Welsh bards. The material of
Rarddas, its editor believed, had been collected
c
·hieAy from the works of bards who flourished from
1he fourteenth to the seventeenth century, by
Llywelyn Sion, who copied them in the library of
Raglan Castle.
'' There is no doubt,'' says the editor, '' that these
hards viewed the traditions of the Gorsedd as the
KCnuine remains of Ancient Druidism ; and thef'e is
94 The Mysterie s of Britain ·
reason to believe tltal in their mai1z features they were
so.1
T he variations observable in minor points
would indicate in what direction, and to what extent,
they suffc>red in their passage from the Christian era
downwards.''
That the introduction of Christianity did not mean
the abandonment of the Druidic philosophy is clear
enough from certain passages in the works ot the
vVelsh bards. One of the triads refers especially to
this when it says : "There are three special doctrines
Lhat have been obtained by the nation of the Cymry:
Lhe first, from the age of ages, was that of the
Gwyddoniaid, prior to the time of Prydain, son of
Aedd the Great; the second was Bardism, as taught
by the Bards. after they had been instituted ; the
third was the Faith in Christ, being THE BEST
OF THE THREE."
Indeed, Christianity seems to have been regarded
by the Kelts as the fulfilment of Druidism, a creed
attuned so closely to the nobler aspirations of the
Keltic spirit that it was easy of assumption by it.
What has been said concerning the Culdee caste
obviously aids this reflection, and it is known that
many Druids actually became Christian priests.
T he famous bull of Pope Gregory I (A.D. 54o-604)
permitted a fusion between Keltic and Christian
belief which rendered the latter easier of acceptance
without altogether destroying the former.
\Ve come now to the material in Barddas itself.
T he first book is entitled "Symbol" and deals
with the origin of letters, the alphabet and the secret
writing of the Bards. Letters,_ says the Bardic
tradition, were invented by Einiged the Giant, son
of Alser, for the purpose of recording praiseworthy
actions, and the wooden blocks on which they were
1 Italics are mine.-L.S.
" Ba rdd as" 95
•nscribed were known as coelbren.• Bran the
Blessed it was who brought Lhe art of dressing goat-
~kin as parchment from Rome. The three original
lcLters were obtained by Menw the Aged from the
voice of God H imself, which manifested itself in rays
or light, thus II\ in three columns. The sense
of 0 was given to the first column, I to the second
ur middle, and V to the third, whence the word O IV,
which may not be pronounced. As a bardic poem
says :
The Eternal, Origin, Self-existent Distributor.
Holy be the lips that canonically pronounce them;
Another name in full word,
Is 0 1 and OIV the word- lcuan Rudd sang it.
13y this name the Universe calls God inwardly-
the sea, the land, earth and air, and all the visibles
and invisibles of the world, all the worlds of all the
Celestials and T errestrials, every thing animate and
inanimate. The three mystic letters signify the three
attributes of God : love, knowledge and truth. It
was because of this principle that three degrees
were conferred upon the Bards of the Isle of
Britain.
Out of the knowledge of the vocalization of
language and speech received from these three
principal letters sixteen letters were formed ; all
letters employed by the Bards were developed from
them, and formed the Abcedilros, a word composed
nf the ten primary letters. Later other letters were
formed, to the number of twenty-four.
But only a Bard of thorough secrecy knows how
the name of God is to be spoken audibly by means
of the thr~e principal columns of letters, because only
he knows their meaning, accent and powers. This
• At least a dozen passages in the bardic poems written
lletween 116o and 16oo allude to this tradition.

secret must not be divulged save to him who is
warranted as having A wen • from God, for God alone
can pronounce His name perfectly. H e who reasons
and meditates will comprehend the meaning of the
primitive system of sixteen letters and will perceive
and understand the Name of God and the just
reverence due to Him. The three lcllers 0. r.V.
were originally and authoritatively writlcn 0 I V.
and without the violation of secrecy there cannot be
another system arising from these letters.
From this trinity of letters arose the custom of
casting knowledge into Triads, and the three rays of
light were regarded as the three principal signs of the
sciences, and from them were obtained fixity and
authority for the arts and sciences.
After a dissertation on the traditions of the manner
in which Bardism and the Gorsedd were established,
we receive enlightenment on the principal elements
of things. These are power, matter and mode.
The elements of Science are life, intellect and
affection ; of \Vic;dom, object, mode and benefit; and
of Memorial~. understanding from affection,
distinctive sign and reverence for the better.
The three foundations of Awen from God are : to
understand the truth, to love the truth and to
maintain the truth.
A long description of Cymric arithmetic follows,
and of the technical making of books or coelbre11,
neither of which is germane to our subject. But we
may quote the following :
The mysteries of the Bards, that is to say, the secret
coclbrcn,s, are small ebillio11, a fing-er long, having notches,
so that they may be used by two persons or more, who
arc confidants. It is by placing and joining them together,
with reference to what is secret, that words and phrases
are formed ; and hy bundling them into words according

to secrecy, missive epistles and :.ccret books are con-
~t ructcd, the meaning of which no one knows but
confidants; nor is it right, according to usage and troth,
to divulge the same. They are called the Charms of the
Hards, or Bardic Mystery.
Secrer coel-vai11s are similar, made of small stones
hearing the marks of my!>tcry; and it is by disposing
them, according to the arrangement and art of the secret,
that necessary sciences arc dcmon~tratcd. And where
such coelhrcns exhibit the number of the tellers of the
Historical coclbrc11, let them be made secret hy changing
one letter for another, so that it be not ascertained, except
from the necessity and declination of the same letter
twice io the same meaning and power.
That is, they are to be cast in cipher.

For us the second book, entitled " Dwy-
Hyddiaeth" , or " Theology", is of greatly more
importance, for in it are enshrined the mystical teach-
ings of Bardism. It opens with a large number of
1hcological triads, which need not be quoted at this
juncture. But farther on we encounter the caption
'' Druidism", in which document we arc informed
of the DruidicaJ idea.<> concerning the n~ture of god-
head. God is goodness and power, a11d is opposed

inability. God mercifully united Himself with this
lifelessness or evil with the intention of subduing it
unto life or goodness, and from this intellectual
existences and animations first sprang.
These began in the depths of Annwn, or the
abyss, the lowest and least grade, for there can be
no intellectual existence without gradation, and in
respect of gradation there cannot but be a beginning,
a middle, an end or extremity-first, augmentation
and ultimate or conclusion. "Thus animations in
Annwn are partakers of life and goodness in the
lowest possible degree and of death and evil in the
highest degree. Therefore they are necessarily evil,
because of the preponderance of evil over the good.
Their duration is necessarily short, but by dissolution
and death they are removed gradually to a higher
degree, where they receive an accumulation of life
and goodness, and thus they progress from grade to
grade:, nearer and nearer to the extremity of Life
and goodness, God, of his merciful affection for
animated beings, preparing the ways along A bred,
out of pure love to them, until they arrive at the state
and point of human existence, where goodness and
evil equiponderate, neither weighing down the other.
From this sprang liberty and choice and elective
power in man, so that he can perform whichever he
likes of any two things, as of good and evil ; and thus
is ,it seen that the state of humanity is a state of
probation and instruction, \"
vhere the good and evil
equiponderate, and animated beings are left to their
own will and pleasure.' '
There are three circles of spiritual evolution, the
Circle of A bred, in which are all corporal and dead
existences, the Circle of Gwynvyd, in which are all
animated and immortal beings, and the Circle of
Ceugant, where there is only God. Abred thus
"Barddas" 99
includes humanity, and all below it. But, necessarily
evil as its condition is, God does not hate the lower
Lhings existing in it, knowing that they cannot be
other~ise. But when life arrives at the point of
humanity in Ab,
red, where good and evil equi-
ponderate, man is free from all obligation, and his
state is one of will and freedom and ability, where
every act is one of consent and choice. Whatever
he does he could do differently, therefore it is right
that he should receive punishment or reward as his
works require.
The enigma of the Bards is posited thus:
" There is nothing truly hidden but what is not
conceivable ;
There is nothing not conceivable but what ts
immeasurable ;
There is nothing immeasurable but God ;
There is no God but that which is not conceivable ;
There is nothing not conceivable but that which is
truly hidden ;
There is nothing truly hidden but God."
Its solution is as follows :
What is not conceivable is the greatest of all, and
the immeasurable of what is not in place ;
God is the greatest of all, and the immeasurable
of intelligence ;
And there can be no existence to any thing but
from intelligence;
And the non-existence of all things comes from
what is not in place.
God the Father, we are informed, is called by
some Hen Ddihenvdd, that is " Ancient and
Unoriginated One,'' " the original lifespring, or

The next manuscript in the ' 1
Book of Theology'',
as this department o( Barddas may be called, is
"The Book of ilardism", hy Llywelyn Sion himself.
This he professes to have extracted from old books,
"namely the books of Einion the Priest, Taliesin the
Chief of Bards, Davydd Ddu of Hiraddug, Cwtta
Cyvarwydd, 1onas of 1\1encvia, Edcryn the Golden-
tongued, Sion Cent, Rhys Goch, and others in the
Library of Raglan, by permission of the lord William
Herbert, earl of Pembroke, to whom God grant that
I may prove thankful as long as I live. The first is
a Treatise in the form of Question and Answer, by
a Bard and his Disciple-the work of Sion Cent,
which contains many of the principal subjects of the
primitive wisdom, as it existed among the Bards of
the Isle of Britain from the age of ages.,.,
lt is couched in the form of question and answer
between the Bard and his disciple.
The Bard first informs the novice that he "came

by Lucan as :1 I'(Od of the Gauls, nnd may later have been
ron£ounded with jesus.

or the bards alluded to has been authenticated, and that the
works or most or them have been published in Tlze Myvyriatt
.I~clueology :md elsewhere. See notes to Barddas, pp. 224·5·
"Bardd as, 101
from the Great \Vorld" and had hjs beginning in
Annwn, but that he is now in the Little \ Vorld,
having traversed the circle of A bred, and is a man at
its termination and extreme limits. Defore thnt, he
was in Annwu "the least possible that was capable of
life", and he has come through every form capable
of body and life to the state of man along the circle
of Abred.
Gwynvyd, he assures the novice, ''cannot be
obtained without seeing and knowing everything, but
it is not possible to see and to know everything
without suffering everything. And there can be no
full and perfect love that does not produce those
things which are necessary to lead to the knowledge
that causes Gwynvyd, for there can be no Gwynvyd
without the complete knowledge of every form of
cxi~tence, and of every evil and good, and of every
operation and power and condition of evil and good.
And this knowledge cannot be obtained without
experience in every form of life , in every incident, in
every suffering, in every evil and in every good, so
that they may be respectively known one from the
other. 1
\ ll this is necessary before there C<'\ll he
G·wy11vyd, and there is need of them all before thetc
c-an be perfect love of God, and there must be perfect
lu,·e of God before there can be G·wy11.vyd.''
Every living being shall attain at last to the circle
nf G1uym-'yd, traversing the circle of A bred from the
clcpth o[ Aumt•11, and passing through death to the
1 ircle of Gwynvyd, so that at length the A bred will
end for ever, ' ' and there shall be no mi~rating
through every form of existence after that. ' ' Rut

act of wisdom, justice and love . It is a prcponcler-
102 The Mys teries o f Britain
ance of these qualities which open to the human soul
the gates of Gwyn-vyd. But he who does not follow
goodness ''shall fall in A bred to a corresponding form
and species of existence of the same nature as himself,
whence he shall return to the state of man as
before. . . . And thus shall he fall for ever until
he seeks godliness." One may fall many times in
A bred, and the migration of most through it is long.
Even the angels who reached Gwynvyd fell once
more in Abred through attempting to reach Ceu.gant,
the sphere inhabited by God alone.
When the Cymry were converted to the faith of
Christ, says Sion, their Bards obtained a clearer
Awen, or inspirational vision, from God. Awen is
to be obtained by habituating oneself to a holy life, to
love, justice and mercy and the practice of good
sciences, and the avoidance of all hatred and cruelty.
That transmigration of a kind is implied in the
bardic writings may be observed from the following
passage : '' When a wicked man dies and his soul
enters the meanest worm in existence, he becomes
better and ascends on the migration of A bred."
The bard Casnodyn (A.D. 1290-1340) seems to
allude to this belief when he says :
Thou didst prepare the slough of hell suitable for Satan,
The habitation for worms, where they will be in mortal
strife.
There follows a quaint myth of the creation, in
which H ebrew and Cymric ideas are strangely
associated, and in which we are informed that the
first man was Menyw the Aged.' The world, it is
said, was formed out of the manred, atoms collected
out of the infinite expanse in the circle of Ceugant
and arranged in order in the circle of Gwynvyd "as
• Cf. the Egyptian Mena, or Menes.
"Barddas" 103
worlds and lives and creatures, without number,
weight or measure. And Amtwn, the abyss, was
created in the extreme limits of the circle of
G·wyn11yd".
We have next to traverse an immense tract of long
and rather sententious triads which need not detain
us here, such as "The three indispensables of godli-
ness : love ; truth ; and prudence.' ' But we return
to essentials when we encounter the doctrine of
E1zeid11addeu.
In the Laws of Dyvnwal Moelmud we read :
''There are three strong punishments : eneid11addezt ;
cutting off a limb ; and banishment from the country,
by the cry and pursuit of men and dogs ; and it is
for the king to direct which he willeth to be inflicted.''
This makes the doctrine in question as old at least
as 430 B.c., says the commentator of Barddas, and
it is plain that the significance of the word is
" reparation". As the passages in relation to it are
somewhat obscure I prefer to quote them :
In tl1ree ways a man may happen to become
e11eidvaddcu; one is punishment due, hy the verdict of
country and law, for injurious evil-an injurious evil
being killing and burning, murder and waylaying, and
the betraying of country and nation. That is to say, he
who commits those evils ought to be executed; and every
execution takes place either by the judgmeor of a court
of law, or in war by the verdict of country and nation.
The second is the man who surrenders himself, at the
demand of justice which he feels in his conscience, to
execution for an injurious and punishable evil, which
he confesses to have committed, and where he canuot
render compensation and satisfaction for the injury he
has done, otherwise than by submitting voluntarily to
the punishment due for what he has done. The third
is the man who undergoes the danger and chance of
execution in behalf of truth and justice, at the call of
peace and mercy, and is slain. Such a man is adjudged
to be slain for the good which he bas done ; and on
that account he ascends to the circle of G'W')'n'Vyd. In
104 Th e Mysteri es o f B ri ta in
any other than these thrt>e ways, a man cannot be
at.ljudgt.>d n;, e11eid1•addc:u l•y man, for it is Cod alone who
k11ows how to jm.lt:c what i!> ntlwrwi-.e. The first of them
will remain in 1lbrc:d, in the state and nature of man,
without falling lower; and the other two will ascend to
the circle of Vwytlvyd.
T he three accelerations of the end of .Jfbrrd: diseases ;
fig hting; and becoming encidvaddeu, justly, r('asonably,
and necessarily, from doing good; for without tht>m there
would he no release from Abreu, hut at a much later
p~·riod. Herein is seen that it wns for the benefit of,
and mercy to, li,•ing heings, God ordained the mutual
fighting and mntt~al slaughter whid1 take place among
them.
\Ve now come to the third book, " The Book of
Wisdom", iP which we are first attracted by the
doctrines of the elements: "Manred, the original
form of all the materials, or all the constituents, that
is, the elements, of which the first four of the five
were dead, namely, calas, Auidity, breath, and fire,
until God agitated them by uttering His Name, when
ins£antly they became alive and in one triumphant
song, and manifested their condition.
"The three materials of every being and existence:
calas, and hence every motionless body and solidity,
and every hardness and concretion ; Auidity, and
hence every cessation, migration, and return ; and
mvyvre, hence every animation and life, and every
strength, understanding and knowledge, and the
same is God, without Whom there can be no life
and vitality.
Others say:
There are three m:nerials of everything, namely :
cains, and hence every corporeity; fluidity, and hence
every colour and form, :1nd every course and return ;
and nwyv1·e, and hence every life, being God, from
Whom proceeds every soul, animation, strength and
understanding, for where He is not, neither one nor
another of these things can exist.' '
" Ra rdda s" 105
According to another mode, as other teachers say
f1om an 11ld accuunL :
Earth, water. lirmamrnt, fire and nyv ; and the
?tyv is God, and life, nod intellect. From the first
four arc all death and mortality ; and from the fifth
:lrC all life and animation, all power, knowledge, and
motion.
We next come to statements regarding the
lVIaterials of Man. T hese are attributed to the Bard
T aliesin, are taken from T he Book of Llanwrst
and are as follows :
There are eight pans in man : the first is the earth,
which is inert and heavy, and from it proceeds the flesh;
the second are the stones, which arc bard, and are the
substance of the bones ; the third is the water, which is
moist and cold, and ic; the substance of the blood; tlw
fourth is the salt, which is briny and sharp, and from it
nrc the nerves, and the tempt'rnmcnt of feeling, as reg ards
bodily sense and faculty ; the fifth is the firmament, or
wind, out of which proceeds the breathing ; the sixth is the
c;un. which is clear and fair, and from it proceed the fire,
or bodily heat. the light and colour; the seventh is the
Ifol v (;host, from \Vhom ic;sue the soul and life ; and the
eiglith is Christ, that is the intellect, wisdom, and the light
of souI and life.
If the preponderating- pnrt of man is from the earth, he
will he fooli sh, slugg-ish and v!'ry heavy; also a short,
little, and slender dwarf, in a great or small degree,
nccording to the prcpond(·rance. If it should be from the
firmament, he will he lig ht, unsteady, garrulous, and fond
of gos.;ip. lf from the stones, his heart, understanding
anrl judg ment will he hard, and he will be a miser and :t
thieL If from the sun, he will be genial, affectionare,
active, docile, and poetic. If from the Holy Ghost, then
he will be godly, amiahle, and merciful, with a just and
g<·ntle judgment, and abounding in arts. And being
thus, he cannot but cquiponclcrate with Christ, and divint>
sonship.
T he parts of the human body in which the faculties
lie are enumerated as follow :
1. In the forehead are the sense and intellect ;
2. In the nape is the memory ;
106 Th e Mysteries of Britain
3. In the pate are discretion and reason ;
4· In the breast is lust;
5· In the heart is love;
6. In the bile are anger and wrath;
7. In the lungs is the breath ;
8. In the spleen is joyousness ;
9. 1n the body is the blood ;
10. In the liver is the heat ;
1 I. In the spirit is the mind ;
12. In the soul is faith.
We are then introduced to a long series of
dissertations on the cycle of the year, and the months,
and later to the "Book of Privilege and Usage",
which deals with the laws and regulations of
Bardism.
The surprising resemblance of the ideas discovered
in Barddas to certain systems of Eastern
philosophy and theology cannot but have struck the
reader. Indeed, it must be clear that it enshrines
the remains of a world-system of thought probably
greatly more ancient than Druidism itself, and
containing ideas common to E gyptian, Br:1hmin and
Buddhist philosophy.
But that it was copied from any of these at first-
hand it is ludicrous to suppose. There was, indeed,
no opportunity for a Welsh bard or bards of the
thirteenth or any century up to the seventeenth
deliberately borrowing from the sacred systems of the
East. True, in Roman times a great deal of
Oriental philosophy found its way to Britain, and it
is possible that this may have coloured Druidism to
some extent. But the main beliefs set forth in the
system appearing in Barddas are already indicated,
if roughly, in what Cresar and other classical writers
have to say regarding Druidism.
" Barddas" 107
It seems, indeed, much more probable that the
system appearing in Barddas had its primal
origin in that North-West African centre whence
came the Iberian race, than in the East. That it had
absorbed Christian elements as well is obvious, but
in the course ot centuries of Christianity it was
impossible that it should not be so. But this renders
it no more "Christian" than certain American Indian
legends have become Christian through European
sophistication.
Let us briefly revtew the '·theological'' matenal
drawn from Barddas. First, we have in God and
Cythraul, light and darkness, an evidence of that
duality visible m most religions which have passed
the primary stage. Only, we do not find Cythraul,
which is described as 1
r darkness1
I and 1
f powerless
inability", as an active force of evil, like Satan, or
the Persian Ahriman. Indeed, this "inability" is
so Little harmful that God actually unites with it to
"subdue it unto life."
A1mwn, the abyss, is a region by no means exotic,
for it enters into the mabiuogi of " Pwyll, Prince of
Dyfed." Its ruler is Arawn, who takes Pwyll's
place on earth for a year while the Prince of Dyfed
sets the affairs of his dark realm to rights. It is also
mentioned in the ancient poem called ''The Spoils of
Am~wn" in The Book of Taliesin, and the name
may even have been applied in a mocking sense to
that part of Britain north of the Wall.
But the earliest type of A1111'lV1l was rather a place
of Elysium than an abyss of death, or it may be,
conversely, that it was the idea of a grim gulf which
was transformed to the notion of a place of delight.
In any case, early ideas of the Otherworld are usually
sufficiently vague, but it certainly looks as if the word
had been utilized in the Bardic writings as a specific
108 Th e Mys t e ries o f Britain
name for a pit of matter awaiting the vivifying
influence of soul-force to spring into life. In this it
bears a resemblance to certain American Indian
mythic centres, especially to that of the Zuni of New
Mexico, and it is similar to the state alluded to in a
hymn in the Hindu Rig-Veda, when there was
neither entity nor non-entity, when the Universe was
undistinguishable water enveloped in darkness.
"The desire (Karma) arose in it, which was the
primal germ of mind the bond between
entity and non-entity.'' This is certainly a most
curious correspondence, but to argue that those from
whose writings the materials in Barddas was taken
knew of this somewhat obscure hymn, is absurd. We
find much the same state of things alluded to in the
Egyptian myth of Ra, in his form of Khepera.
"Heaven,' ' says Ra, "did not exist, and earth had
not come into being, and the things of the earth and
creeping things had not come into existence in that
place, and I raised them from out of Nu, from a state
of inactivity." This Nu was a watery abyss, similar
to Atl11WJ£ (pronounced "Anoon"). \Vhen the myth
was affixed to the theology nf the Osirian religion we

CHAPTER V
THE ARCANE TRADITION IN BRITISH
MEOI.-EVAL L ITERATURE
WE have now to pursue our quest for the evidences
of the survival of native arcane belief in the medireval
literature of l3ritain. Geoffrey of Monmouth's
Historia Regmn Britannire has been so canvassed by
the critics that I do not propose to enter the welter
of controversy concerning the authenticity of its
sources. I will only say that from the first I almost
instinctively adopted the theory of its derivation from
ancient Cambrian and Breton sources. Subsequent
srudy of the work has not shaken that early
impression, but I may perhaps brieAy justify it here.
Geoffrey's proper name was Grufydd ab Arthur,
he was a Welshman and Archdeacon of Monmouth,
therefore had exceptional opportunities of gleaning
the traditions of his race as current during the twelfth
century. H e states clearly in the preface of one of
the earliest manuscript copies of his work that he
''turned this book from Kyrnraeg to Latin and in
my old age retranslated it from Latin to
Kymraeg." It was, therefore, first written in the
Welsh tongue. A later version of the manner in
which it was composed states that Walter Mapes,
Archdeacon of Oxford, brought a book from Brit-
tany, written in the British language, which could only
be translated byone who had a knowledge of Kymric,
and that this is the basis of Geoffrey's history.
T here seems to be nothing inharmonious in the
two statements. Geoffrey might well have drawn
the materials of his history from Welsh tradition and
109
110 Th e Mys t e ri es o f Brita in
from such a Breton book, and I have never felt
constrained to credit for a moment that his work is
"one of the great literary ruses of all time." His
facts differ materially [rom those of Nennius and the
Cymric chronicles by being more diffusive in parts,
defective in others and less particular in all. I do
not for a moment suggest that much of it is not
fabulous, but this does not at all detract from the
probability that it was drawn from such sources as I
believe it to have been. Moreover, many of the
allusions to the Arthurian story are such as were
almost certainly derived from a Breton source.
Arthur's residence is invariably given as Caerleon,
while the British chronicles as constantly refer it to
Cornwall. Moreover the Roman wars of that hero
are altogether unknown to the native legends, and
the descriptions of Paris, Burgundy, the Alps and
Italy could certainly not have been written in the
first instance by a contemporary Briton. Again,
Geoffrey displays an almost complete ignorance of
Kymric incidents in Arthur's career, and the
discrepancies between his work and that of Nennius
as regards early British chronicles are so salient as
to render it positive that he followed some alien source
in the main. The mere fact, too, that the Breton
book is associated with the name of Walter Mapes,
the great introducer of Cymric romance in Norman
dress, is sufficient to justify Geoffrey's statement that
he procured it from l\lapes, who never at any time
denied the circumstance.
But this is not to say that Geoffrey had not access
to certain Welsh manuscripts and traditions, or that
he did not make use of them. T hat he did , is, I
think, obvious enough, [rom the fact that he was
also the author of the Vita M erlini, the prophecies
of Merlin.
Th e Ar ca n e Tra dition 111
Now, Mr. Kendrick says that in his history and
his Vita Geoffrey mentions not a word about
Druidical training or practice. But that is surely
beside the question. He alludes to Merlin, for
example, as " rex erat et vates", a king and a
prophet. But as we do not have the Welsh version
of his history to guide us, we cannot say from what
word the expression ''vates'' was translated.
In Geoffrey's history, then, I believe we have a
mingling of British and Armorican traditions. What
light, precise!r, does it cast on the early British
tradition of arcane belief, if any at all ?
In Chapter X we read how Bladud kept fires in
the Temple of l\linerva which never went out, and
how he taught necromancy in his kingdom, "nor did
he leave off practising his magical operations till he
attempted to Ay to the upper region of the air with
wings which he had prepared, and feU down upon
the Temple of Apollo in the city of Trinovantum,
where he was dashed to pieces." This is precisely
what we find certain Irish Druids practising.
Then we read of King Leir, who partitioned the
kingdom between his daughters, and of the manner
in which he was buried in a tomb under the River
Sore at Leicester, "which had been built originally
underground to the honour of the god Janus''.
Janus here undoubtedly stands for Bran "the
Blessed", whose triple-faced head, like that of the
Roman god, had magical properties of guardianship,
and Leir himself is merely the British sea-god Llyr,
the father of Manannan. Belinus, who follows in
the chronicle, is another Druidical god disguised as
a British king.
Searching for other reminiscences of the survivals
of Druidic belief, we encounter a reference to Lud,
who rebuilt the walls of Trinovantum, or London,
112 Th e Mys t e ri es o f B rita in
who is the Keltic deity Llud or Nodens. A little
farther on, we read of a great sacrifice of animals
offered up by Cassibelaun to "the tutelary g'Jds" in
token of victory. " At this solemnity they offered
forty thousand cows and a hundred thousand sheep,
and also fowls of several kinds without number,
besides thirty thousand wild beasts of several kinds.
As soon as they had performed these solemn honours
to their gods, they feasted themselves on the
remainder, as was usual at such sacrifices.'' T he
description of the animals thus slaughtered is pre-
c-isely in line with Druidic practice, especially with
regard to the wild beasts, of which many thousands
were annually sacrificed at the Druidic festivals.
In the njn"eteenth chapter of the fourth book an
account is given of the manner in which Lucius, King
of Britain, embraced Christianity. The passage
reads :
The holy doctors, after they had almost extinguished
paganism over the whole island, dedicated the temples,
that had been founded in honour of many gods, to the
one only God and His saints, and filled them with con-
gregations of Christians. There were then in Britain
eight and twenty flamens, as also three archflamens, to
whose jurisdiction the other judges and enthusiasts were
subject. These also, according to the apostolic com-
mand, they delivered from idolatry, and where they were
flamens made them bishops, where archflamens, arch-
bishops. The seats of the archflamens were at the three
noblest cities, viz., London, York, and the City of
Legions, which its old walls and buildings show to have
been sjtuated upon the River Uskc in Glamorganshirc.
To these three, now purified from superstition, were made
subject twenty-eight bishops, with their dioceses.
T his account is usually regarded as entirely
fabulous. But when one recalls what has already
been said regarding the Culdees and the existence
in the ('arly British Church for many centuries of a
caste whic-h in many ways differed from the orthodox
Th e Arcane Tr a diti o n 113
4 lcrgy, it seems not altogether improbable that it
may be based on fact, i£it is not altogether accurate.
T he next reference of interest is that concerning
~ ~ erlin, who was consulted by Vortigern regarding
Lhe building of a tower in whjch he might successfully
defend him!)elf from the fury of the Saxons. I !caring
that Merlin is a man who never had a father, and
being advised by his magicians to seek for such an
one and to sprinkle the foundations of the tower with
his blood, in order to put a finish to an earthquake
which constantly overthrows it, Vortigern sends for
him. H e confutes the magicians, and tells the king
that his tower will not stand because of two dragons,
red and whjte, which Lie beneath it in a pool. Merlin
then prophesies concerning the future of Britain in
a strain which indubitably must have been borrowed
£rom native Cambrian sources.
Later, Aurelius, King of Britain, desirous of
erecting a monument to those British nobles who had
been slaughtered by the Saxons, once more consults
Merlin as to the nature it should take, and Lhe
enchanter advises him to send to Ireland for the
Giants' Dance (Stonehenge), and to erect it in
Britain as a lasting memorial to the dead heroes.
At this Aurelius laughed, and l\lerlin, rebuking him,
answered:
I entreat your majesty to forbear ,·ain laughter, for
what I say i!- without vanity. They arc mystical st otw~.
and nf a rncdirinal virtue. The g innls of old hroughl

which inrallibly cured them. With the like success tbcy

healing virtue.
H
114 T h e Mysteri es of Brita in
The stones were accordingly taken down and con-
veyed to Britain, where they were re-erected.
1 submit that this account is a broken and hazy
tradition of the actual carriage of certain of the stones
of Stonehenge to Salisbury Plain. I do not for a
moment mean to convey the impression that Stone-
henge was erected by the Druids, for there is the
best possible evidence that it was built 1700-rSoo
years B.C. , although it was certainly utilized by the
Druids in their time. But I wish to indicate the
A&ican association of the cult connected with
Stonehenge, as mentioned in the legend, and to
point out that certain of the stones or lesser uprights
are actually of non-local origin, having been brought,
according to Dr. Thomas, of H. M. Geological
Survey, from the PresceUy Range in Pembrokeshire.
That they were erected a little later than the large
outer stones is certain. Their "alien" origin is thus
soundly proven, and I believe Geoffrey's account
of the business to be a distorted and time-worn
memory of the manner in which they were conveyed
from west to east. His history is thus justified to a
great extent as a record of traditions extraordinarily
venerable and important.'
But was Merlin really a "Druid"? Indeed, are
there any grounds for believing that he ever existed?
Says Mr. Kendrick :
Actually the Merlin stories form a group that origin-
ally concerned two distinct persons, one a sixth century
Welsh prince, Myrddin ab Morfryn, and the other
Vortigcrn's prophet Ambrosius, who figures in the
Historia Rritorwm of Nennius. Gcoll'rcy used the name
Merlinus for both these persons, and then proceeded to
combine the stories about them as thoug h they referred
to a single individual. The \N'elsh prince is certainly the
hero of his later Vit~JJ Merli11i, but in the earlier Historia
• On the whole question of Stonehenge see F. Stevens's
Stonehenge To-day and Yesterday, pubJjshed by the Stationery
Office.
Th e Arcane Tra dition 115
Regum Britannia it is Ambrosius who is uppermost in
his mind; in fact, in his first work he plainly says that
Ambrosius was another name for Merlin.
Other authorities, however, have different explana-
tions o£ the personality of Merlin. Canon l\lacCulloch
regards him as ''an ideal magician, possibly an old
god, like the Irish 'god of Druidism' ". Rhys
believed him to be a description of Keltic Zeus, who
was worshipped at Stonehenge.
It has been assumed by certain authorities, the
Comte de Villemarque among them,' that Myrddin
ab Morfryn was a different personage from Medin-
Ambrosius , or l\lerlin E mrys , as he is sometimes
called. But both appear to have lived in Strathclyde,
both were enchanters and predicted the same events.
Again Mcrlin-Ambrosius appears as a young man
before Vortigern about the year 480, and Merlin ap
i\forfryn at the Court of Rydderch Hael is an old
man in Si O· ~ I erlin ah ~ forfryn the prince was
apparently the person whose character formed the
nucleus from which the other was developed as a
figure in later romance. At the Court of Rydderch
Hael he was known as Lalockin, or " the twin", and
in the dialogue between him and his sister
Gwentldydd she alludes to him as "my world-famous
twin brother". T he \Vclsh bards of the t\velfth
century, too, put the predictions of Medin-Ambrosius
into the mouth of lVIerlin ab Morfryn , and this more
than a century after Geoffrey's history had been
written, therefore they must have believed them to
be identical. It seems probable that Medin-
Ambrosius was so called hecause of his patronage
by Aurelius Ambrosius, brother of Uther Pendragon,
who was supposed to have destroyed the unpatriotic
Vortigern, and to have transplanted Stonehenge. In
all likelihood Merlin-Amhrosius is a mythological
• Ban a;; Brei:, lntro., p. 12, Vol. I.
116 The My s terie s or Britain
character engrafted on to Merlin ah Morfryn, who
in his youth may have been associated with Aurelius
Ambrosius. Indeed, there are several Welsh poems
amibuted to Merlin, and there is no good reason why
he should not be regarded as a real mau, a "bardic
president about the \Vater of Clyde", as his sister
calls him, renowned as an enchanter and wise man
in the sixth century. I am aware that recent
criticism absolutely denies the reality of Merlin, hut
that a Merlin actually existed is proved, and I cannot
subscribe to decisions which are obviously based more
on a mere affectation of contempt for tradition , and
even fact, than on reasonable or historical gmum.ls.
T o see the entire corpus of Arthurian literature
rejected as an arch~eologist of the T ape-Measure
School might reject an artifact because it had no
"horizon" , is painful indeed. \tVhen will historical
critics learn that tradition, in the proper hands, can
be as of much avail as written record? But the
Welsh poems which presume to have been written
by him are certainly much later th:\ll the actual
Merlin's time. That Cymric tradition acknowledged
Merlin as a Druid may be seen from the following
verses from the Breton, given by Villemarque :
Merlin I Merlin I where art thou ~oing
So early in the day wi1h thy hlack rlog?
Oi I oi I oi I oi I oi I
loi I oi ! oi I ioi ! oi !
( have come here to !'('arch for tlw wny,
To find the red egg;
The red egg of the marine serpent,
By the sea side in the hollow of the stone.
I am going to seck in the valley,
The green water cress, and the golden grass,
And the top branch of the oak,
In the wood by the side of the fountain.
Th e A r ca n e T r a d ition 117
:\1crlin! Merlin! rctrarc your steps;
Lt'ave the hranch on the oak,
And the green water cress in the valley,
As well as the golden grass;
i\ncl lca,·e the red egg of the marine serpent,
In the foam bv the hollow of the stone.
Merlin! Merlitl! retrace thy steps,
There is no diviner but God.
\ .illcm~rque, writing of the above poem, s:lys:
This (the Herhe d'or, g-olden g-rass) is a mrrlicinal
plant, which the peasant Bretons hold in great estimation
They pretend that at a distance it shines like gold; and
it is for this they give it the name. If one should happen
to tread upon it, he will fall asleep, and come to under-
stand the languages of hirtls, dogs and wolves. It is
hut rarely to be mel with, and then only early in the
morning; to g-ather it, it is necessary to go barefooterl
and in a shirt, and it should not be cut, but plucked
out from the root. It is said that holy men only will
he able to find it. It is no other than the Sciage. Also,
in going to gather it barefooted, :tnd in a white robe,
and fasting, no iron should be employed, the right hand
should be passed under the left arm, and the linen should
only be used once. "•
It will thus be seen that Geoffrey's writings arc
perhaps more redolent of Druidism than certain critics
may credit, that if he does not actually mention the
word "Druid" , his pages enshrine a goodly propor-
tion of traditional material referring to Oruidi<:
customs and personages, proving that the tradition ,,f
Druidism, if concealed by the Bardic caste, was by
no means popularly defunct in his day, as, indeed,
we know from the material concerning Prince H ywcl.
The value of the Arlhurian literature in the
conservation of anr.ienl British mysticism is very
considerable . That literature may for all practical
purposes be divici<'ci intn two sections: that whirh
was the work of \Vt..+·.h barus and orose out nf \Vel"h
tradition, and Lhat "hirh was probably deriveJ tht'r<'

It is surprising what a hold the Arthurian saga
seems to have taken on the British mind (rom first
to last, and this ran only be accounted for, I think,
not only by the circumstances that it had a native
origin, or that it appealed to the generations " when
chivalry lifted up her lance on high'' , but that it was
innately and instinctively felt that in these ancient
British tales there resided not only the memory of
brave and romantic things, but a mystical tradition
much more profound and thought-compelling.
This occult tradition, indeed, emerged more clearly
defined in the literature of the Grail, which, in some
respects, is an appendix to the Arthurian saga. But
the latter itself in its more separate form is our theme
at the moment.
It would be fruitless here to deal at any length
with the origins o( the Arthurian saga. That it was
Keltic and British there can be no reasonable doubt.
It appears from a comparative study to have been
common to both branches of the Keltic race in
Britain, and the Normans, making conquests in South
Wales, became familiar with it. As Rhys indicates,
the names Arthur and Airem proceed from a common
verbal root. Airem and Emer were, in Irish legend,
the sons of Golam or Mil, and are the Keltic
equivalents of Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars.
Emer seems to have been the eponymous ancestor
of the non-Keltic inhabitants of Ireland, and was
slain by Airem, the progenitor of the conquering
Kelts. Airem wedded Etain, daughter of E tar,
King of the Echraidi or Faery, who was carried off
by one l\1 ider, in precisely the same manner as
Guinevere was spirited away by Modred. Etain and
Guinevere were both daughters of fairy kings.
'' Provided due allowance is made for the difference
between the social settings of the respective stories,"
Th e Arca ne Tra dition 119
·..tys Rhys, "the similarity becomes more unmistak-
.ti,Jc the more it is scanned". The names of both
queens, too, can be traced etymologically to a similar
tt)ot, implying "ghostly" or "shadowy". Thus not
nnly the circumstances of the legends but the actual
...imilarity of the names of their principal personages
•>cern to show that the northern Goidelic Kelts
possessed a body of myth almost precisely parallel
with the Arthurian story of the Brythons. The high
literary excellence and more formal shape of the
1\rthurian tradition, coming from the south, probably
dicta.ted the absorption of the similar Goidelic myth,
and resulted in the final reunion of traditions which
must have had a similar provenance in the misty
past, when Goidel and Cymry were as yet undivided.
The existence of a powerful British or Vvelsh-
speaking state in Strathclyde in the south-west of
Scotland and Cumberland probably did much to fuse
the two Keltic legends into one, and the later
migration of many of its inhabitants to North Wales
must have assis~cd the process.
" The original machinery, so to say, of W elsh
tales,'' says Rhys,' '' wns magic and the super-
natural. This was also probably the case
with the stories about Arthur as they came from the
mouths of the Brythonic K elts.'' That they had their
origin in mythological ideas associated with the
religion of the Druids there can be no doubt. Says
Canon l\'JacCulloch : '' vVe may postulate a local
Arthur saga fusing an old Rrr thonic god with the
historic sixth century Arthur. From this or from
Geoffrey's handling of it sprang the great romantic
cycle. In the nimh century Nennius's Arthur is the
historic war-chief, possibly Count of Britain, but in
the references to hi" hunting the Pouus Troit {the
• 1l11/rurian Lege1
td, p. 2,
120 T he M y s t e r i e s o f Br i t a i n
T wrch Tnvylh) the mythic Arthur momentarily
appears. Geoffrey's Arthur differs from the later
Arthur of romance, and he may have partially
rationalized the saga, which was either of recent
formation or else local and obscure , since there is no
reference to Arthur in the Mabi11ogim1. In
Geoffrey, Arthur is the fruit of Igerna's amour with
Uther, to whom Merlin has given her husband's
shape. Arthur conquers many hosts as weU as
giants, and his court is the resort of all valorous
persons. But he is at last wounded by his wife's
seducer, and carried to the Isle of Avallon to be
cured of his wounds, and nothing more is ever heard
of him. Some of these incidents occur also in the
stories of Fionn and Mongan, and those of the
mysterious begetting of a wonder child and his final
disappearance into fairyland are local forms of a tale
common to all branches of the Kelts. This was fitted
to the history of the local god or hero Arthur, giving
rise to the local saga to which were afterwards added
events from the life of the historic Arthur. This
complex saga must then have acquired a wider fame
long before the romantic cycle rook its place, as is
suggested by the purely Welsh tales of Kulhwych
and the Dream of Rho11ab·wy, in the former of which
the personagt's (gods) of the Mabinogion figure in
Arthur's train, though he is far from being the
Arthur of the romances. Sporadic referenc-es to
Arthur occur also in W clsh literature, ancl to the
earlier saga belongs the Arthur who spoils Elysium
of its cauldron in a Taliesin poem. H e
may have been the object of a cult as these heroes
(Fionn and Cuchulainn) perhaps were, or he may
have been a god more and more idealized as a hero.
If the earlier fnrm of his namP was Artor, 'a plough-
man', but perhaps with a wider significance, anti
T he Arcan e T ,-ad it io n 121
having an equivalent in Artaius, a Gaulish god
<·quated with Mercury, he may have been a god of
.tgricultw·e who became a war-god. But he was also
regarded as a culture-hero, stealing a cauldron and
also swine from the gods' land, the last incitlent
t·uhemerized into the tale of an unsuccessful theft
from l\'larrh, son of Meirchion, while, like other
culture-heroes, he is a bard.''
This pretly well summarizes the question of
Arthurian origins. In Arthur's saga nearly ~II the
characters are reminiscent of ancient Brythonic
deities, Kai, Peredur , and the rest. It remains for us
to discover precisely how much o£ the mystical tradi-
Lion is to be found remaining in (I) the native \•
Velsh
poems which allude to him and (2) in the Norman
and English romances which deal with his story.
We have already dealt to some extent with the
tradition of Arthur as alluded to in the pages of
Geoffrey and Nennius. The early W elsh poems
contain few references to Arthur, indeed only five
mention him at all, and then it is rather the
''historical'' than the mythical Arthur. But there is
one poem which merits our especial consideration.
That is the poem generally known as " The Spoils
of Annwn" , credited to the bard T aliesin. Owing
to its importa nce to our general thesis it is essential
that the poem be here given in its entirety. The
translation is that o£ Thomas Stephens.'

The last line, as Davies surmised, is almost
certainly a later addition. Critics have turned away
from this most abstruse poem in despair. What is
its purport, its hidden meaning? " Could Lycophon
or the sibyls," asks Turner. "or any ancient oracle
be more elaborately incomprehensible?'' Davies
believed that it was associated with his 11
Arkite''
mythology. It is obvious, however, that the Arthur
with whom we have to do is not the Arthur of
romance, but of myth, and that the expedition in
which he sailed had for its object the exploration of
the infernal regions. The poem is on the same lines
as " The Harrying of Hell", the descent into the
gulf, to cow its evil denizens and carry away its
secrets and treasures. It is, indeed, part of the ritual
of the candidate for adeptship into the British
mysteries, resembling that for the neophyte into the
Osirian, Cabiric or Orphean mysteries.
If the poem be analysed, the first verse will be
found to refer to the Underworld region of An?tw-1'.
" The prison of Gwair in Caer Sidi" may be
explained as follows: Gwair ap Geircin had
attempted the journey, or essayed the adeptship, had
failed, and had been imprisoned in Caer Sidi, which
sometimes means the Zodiac, sometimes Annwn

itself. H e was known as "one oE the three supreme
prisoners of the isle of Britain", and was held in
bondage by Pwyll, Prince of AmlWtl and Pryderi, his
son. The intention of Arthur and his company was
probably to rescue him or complete his initiation, and
for that purpose three times a greater number of
initiates than could be contained by Arthur's ship
Pridwen essayed the task. Anmm1 is described in
the l\'labinogion of PwylJ as a palatial dwelling replete
with every luxury rather than a darksome abyss, thus
showing that the idea of it had become conven-
tionalized.
The second verse alJudes to the mystic cauldron of
Keridwen, warmed by the breath of the nine damsels,
the cauldron of inspiration already described, and
"the island of the strong door" mentioned in the
fourth verse has reference to some such mysterious
island as Sena, where dwelt the nine damsels or
Druidesses. The Caer W ydr spoken of in the fifth
verse was Arthur's vessel oE glass constructed for
the especial purpose of the exploration of A mt'lvn,
and the bard says that he "will not have merit with
the multitude in relating the hero's deeds•. because
they could not see his prowess after he had entered
Caer W ydr, or the 'place' or vessel of glass".
Merlin made a similar voyage in a similar ship or
diving-bell, as did Alexander the Great, and indeed
the latter story is mentioned by Taliesin. The
allusion to "the brindled ox with his headband" is
obviously to the sacred beast which figured in all
such mysteries, the Osirian and the Mithraic as well
as the British, the White Bull of the Sun. The
place-names which conclude most o( the stanz~
appear to have reference lo various regions in
Annwn.
The last verse may be an addition, but in any case

' l~t1rchmen compared with that of the Druidic bards,
• •lwcially as regards their ignorance of the regions

Taken as a whole, this mysterious poem seems to
t••l•·r to a definite attempt on the part of the initiates
,,1 ··•unc mysticaJ society to explore the underworld
l'l.11w of A nnwn. Attempts have been made to prove
111.1
1 it really has reference to an expedition of Arthur
'" Cakdonia, which was euphemisticaJly known as
''"171111 or E ades, probably by virtue of the old
11.uletion mentioned hy Procopius which alluded to the
l.11:tl conditions prevailing north of the Roman Wall.
l\111 rhc mystical allusions in the poem readily dispose

Rhys equates this with passages in the Welsh
"Seint Greal" legend, and states with reference to
Gweir that ''he had only returned after a terrible
imprisonment there (Caer Sidi), an initiation which
made him for ever a bard". Farther on, once more
referring to the cauldron, he says :
With regard to tJ1at vessel, Taliessin, in poem xxx,
mentions the following things respecting it: The Cauldron
of the Head of H ades had a rim set with pearls adorning
it; the fire beneath it was kindled by the breath of nine
maidens, utterances might be heard issuing from it;
and it would not boil food for a coward. The other poem
does not mention the cauldron as being at Caer Sidi, but
says that he who has his seat there has nought to fear
from plague or old age. Compare with this what is said
of the Grail in the romances, where Pelles and his brother
figure. The Grail, when it comes, feeds those at the
table with whatever kind of food each one ciesires. But
those who are not wortJ1y are not allowed by it to remain
or to approach too near with impunity. Similarly those
who worship at the Grail Chapel at King Peleur's remain
young nor mark the lapse of time. Add to this that the
Grail heals the sick and wounded. By means of accounts
other than those in which the r.rail belongs to Pclles or
Peleur, the correspondence between it and the Cauldron
of Pwyll, Head of Hades, might, perhaps, be more strik-
ingly shown; but the foregoing is sufficiently ncar for our
purpose. Now, as the original identity of PeUes and
Peleur with Pwyll and Pryderi has been shown to be
probable, as has also the identity of Carbonek, where the
Holy Grail was kept, with Caer Pedryvan, where Pwyll's
Cauldron was found by Arthur and his men, the conclusion
is all but inevitable, that the famous Cauldron served as a
prototype of the far more famous Grail.
vVe see, therefore, that the visit to Annwn, the
"Astral Plane", as we might call it, was for the
purpose of seizing its spoils, its cauldron of mystical
wisdom or inspiration. It is plain that a certain ritual
must be gone through, a severe initiation, before
its portals could be gained, and there was a risk of
failure and "imprisonment", even of destruction.
The prize was the Grail or cauldron of prophecy,
T he A r ca n e T r ad it io n 127
\\ l,u h renewed life and gave health to the soul. That
tlw cullus which guarded the secret was one of select
ttlllt.tlcs is obvious from the allusion to the multitude
"ltn " know nor" the ritual of its mysteries.
ll,ttl what of Arthur's connection with this myth
.,, 111itiation and of the H arrying of H ades? It is
1•l.1111 that he, like Osiris, is the god of a mystical
•11lt who must periodically take a journey through
tlw underworld, not only for the purpose of subduing
,,.. •·vii inhabitam!';, but of learning their secrets and
P·•···nvords in order that the souls of the just, the
1w1 ft·cted initiates, will be enabled to journey through
tl,,,, plane unharmed. This Osiris did. By his
•'l:•·rll'y, through the spells and P.asswords given in
Ill'. ll()oks, the dead Osirian, the man of his cult, is
lr.lltkC'd safely through the gloomy region of Amenti,
tl11 · I~gyptian Am1w 11, to the golden realm of the
dl\•tnity, so that he may live for ever.
l'hat Arthur and Osiris are indeed figures
""ginating in a common source must be reasonably
' l···•r to the student of myth. Druidism is only the
•ulr nf Osiris in another form, and Arthur seems to
1•.•w a common origin with Ausar or Osiris. When
t\r thur is slain at the battle of Camelon by his
t " '"( herous nephew Modred , he is carried off in a
l•.1111ttc by his sister to the mysterious Isle of Avallach
"' J\ v:tlton, an oversea or underworld locality, "the
l'l.u·c· of Apples". There he remains, neither alive
"'" ·~··ad, awaiting the fateful day when Britain shall
'''l"irc· his sword.
I lw history of Osiris has many points oE resem-
lclaun· with that of Arthur. When slain by his
'"'''dwrous brother Set, the body of the Egyptian
•" ,d was ferried in the sacred barque across the Nile,
•••n"'l1anied by his mourning sisters Isis and
N•·pluhys, to the region of Aalu in the W est, a place
128 The Mysteries o f Britain
of plenteous fruits and grain. There Osiris was
supposed to rule as the god of the not-dead, awaiting
a glorious resurrection.
Both Arthur aud Osiris were .tssociated with the
cuJt o[ the bull. Osiris, indeed, is referred to as a
bull, the Apis bull was merely a form of him, and
in the poem by T aliesin quoted previously, the
sacred ox is alluded to in connection with Arthur's
descerll into Amtwl~.
H orus is probably the resurrected form of Osiris,
and his myth bears a close resemblance to that of
Arthur. Like that monarch, he gathers round him
a company of warriors who devote themselves to the
destruction of evil monsters. Horus was typified by
the hawk, as Arthur was by the crow, for no
Englishman in olden times would kill a crow lest it
held the hero's spirit. The name of Arthur's
nephew Gwalchmei also means " hawk".
It will thus be seen that the points of resemblance
between Arthur and Osiris arc neither few nor
unimportant, and that their myths appear to have
arisen from a common source. That Arthur was
the god of a mystical cult, one of whose rites was
associatM with a real or allegorical passage through
a lower 1,J;me from which mysterious secrets and
treasures might be reft, seems certain enough. Are
there anv evidences of the survival of that belief in
British literature or tradition?
Let us first examine the Scottish legend of Thomas
the Rymnur, which survivcs in a very anciC'nt ballad
form. Thom<ls meets with the Queen of Faerie at
the Eildon Tree, near Ercildoune, and enters her
mystic hill. After a long journey through the Keltic
Underworld, they reach a sphere which is unques-
tionably one and the ~me with the A 11wum of Welsh
legend. It is. indeed, Avallon, (or it is wealthy in
Th e Ar ca n e Tr adi tio n 129
.tpple-trees, which, however, must not be plucked.
llttt that Thomas entered it as an initiate is clear
Irom the fact that its queen instructs him in the art
of prophecy, the very art, indeed, sought in Annwn
or Avallon by Arthur and his followers. Moreover,
the region in which Thomas actually lived was long
Lefo~e his day either a part of the Keltic and vVelsh-
speaking kingdom o£ Strathclyde or closely in
wiLUral touch with it. The Keltic implications of
the myth are not far to seek. His surname of
Learrnonl, indeed, if it be actually historical, might
l)e interpreted as signifying the lVlount of Ler or
Llyr, the old British sea-god, father of Manannan,
from whom the Isle of Man and Clackmannan take
their names. But this is a mere walking upon the
sands of surmise, and much surer footing is to be
found in the known fact that he flourished in an
environment which in his time was by no means yet
dissociated from Keltic tradition, and in the
assuredly Keltic colouring of the myth in which he
appears. Not only is the name of Thomas Rymour
traditionally connected with prophecies which con-
tain a wealth o£ Keltic allusions, but something more
than mere tradition associates his name with the
authorship of a romance the setting and personnel
of which are essentially Keltic-that Sir Tristra1n,
which was cobbled and completed by a Wizard still
more potent than he. There exist, too, excellent
reasons for believing that even in the fourteenth
century his cow1tryside had not altogether cast off
the memory and influences of that Brythonic
civilization which had formerly flourished there. T he
etymology by which his sobriquet of "True
Thomas" is explained as " Druid" Thomas may
seem far-fetched enough, but has authority behind
it at least equal in value to the evidence afforded by
130 Th e Mys t e ries o f Brita in
that tradition of prophetic practice which is said to
have given him the title.
But even more valuable as a clue to the Keltic
character of Thomas's legend is that portion of it
which records his durance in a subterranean environ-
ment which recalls the underground dun of the
sidhe or fairies of Scotland, Ireland, and Brittany.
Not only is it the veritable Queen of Faerie herself
who spirits Thomas away, but the description
afforded of her and the mise en scene of her domain,
no less than certain happenings therein, prove her
m be of Keltic provenance. She is attired in a
manner which corresponds closely with the descrip-
tions we have of the sidhe of Ireland, and is
accompanied by the inevitable greyhounds so dear
to these picturesque mound-dwellers. Like the
Loathly Lady of Arthurian story, she assumes a
hag-like aspect on being kissed. Once beneath
Eildon Hill, Thomas beholds the orchard so charac-
teristic of the Keltic Otherworld, but is warned that
he must not partake of its fruit, a certain proof that
this is no other than the food of the dead, of which
if a man eat he may give up all hope of regaining
upper earth. He hears, too, the rushing of the great
waters which separate the Keltic Otherworld from
the land of the quick.
It is also noticeable that the names alluded to in
the prophecies of Thomas are almost exclusively
those of Keltic mages and scribes, Merlin and Gildas
being chieAy quoted, and the legends relating to the
first-mentioned being freely drawn upon. The
Arthurian character of many of the prophecies is,
indeed, too marked to be ignored, and Scott, duly
impressed by this, gave it as his opinion in his
introduction to Sir Tristram. that Thomas had
collected his material from among the Boating
Th e Arcane Tradition 131
It aditions of the British or \Velsh-speaking people
,,f Strathclyde, which still lingered in the southern
••t~Jnties during the fourteenth century.
Now it is apparent, although it has not so far been
.dluded to in any study of the subject, that Thomas's
ltw·nd has many points of resemblance with that of
l'dt·rlin himself, especially as detailed in Breton
lulklore. Like Thomas, l\llerlin was a soothsayer
who fell a victim to the wiles of a fairy enchantress,
\'ivien, whom, according to one Breton form of the
t.w·nd, he met in the glades of Broceliande. He
dwelt with her in Joyous Garden, but in this case
tt was the man and not the "gay ladye" who
,-xhibited signs of age once the troth was plighted.
" It was foreseen long ago," says Merlin, " that a
l. t~ly should lead me captive, and that I should
lwt·11me her prisoner for all time." For a season
lw leaves Joyous Garden, as Thomas and T ann-
lt.iu;;cr leave their places of durance. But Vivien
f,•,trns from him an enchantment which will keep him
with her for ever, and employs it to retain him in her
f'IIWCr. Waving her cloak round his head, she
t•lunges him into a deep slumber, and transports him
""''t' more to Joyous Garden, where he is doomed
111 remain as the prisoner of love for ever.
Hut the important thing for us is that Thomas's
•••vth relates the adventures of a man, and a man
who once actually existed, in search of initiation in
tlw Underworld. H ere we have a Scotsman of the
1hu tc.·t·nth century experiencing practically the same
~•dwntures in the Underworld, or astral plane, as
tlu l Arthur and his companions.
And this is only one of a number of accounts in
wltid1 living men are said to have probed the secrets
uf the supernatural world and penetrated to some
uht~.·rranean sphere in search of hidden knowledge
132 T he M y s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
-sure evidence that the Cult of Druidic initiation
survived well into modern times.
Jl will he germane Lo the argument if we examjne
one or two of the more modern of these explorations.
Let us turn to Tire Secret Commomveallh of Elves,
Fawns, and Fairies, written in 1691 by the Rev.
Robert Kirk, M.A., Minister of Aberfoyle in
Scotland, and edited by the late Andrew Lang in
1893. The MS. of the book seems to have been in
the possession of Colin Kirk, \Vriter to the Signet,
Edinburgh, and does not appear to have been printed
before the issue of 1815 by Messrs. Longman,
Scott's statement to the contrary notwithstanding.
The circumstances of Kirk's life are well enough
authenticated. He was a student of theology at St.
Andrews University, but took his Master of Arts
degree at Edinburgh. H e was the seve11fh and
youngest son of James Kirk , who had also held the
charge of Aberfoyle, and he originally ministered at
Balquidder. A Keltic scholar , he translated the
Bible and Psalter into Gaelic, publishing the latter in
1684. H e was twice married, first to Jsobel,
daughter of Sir Colin Campbell of Mochester, and
secondly to the daughter of Campbell of Forday, who
survived him. I mention these facts merely to show
that he was not apochryphal. H e died in 1692, at
the age of 51, and his tomb is inscribed '' Robertus
Kirk, B.M., Linguce H ibernice Lumen." " In
Scott's time," says Lang, " the tomb was to be
seen in the east end of the Churchyard of Aberfoyle ;
but the ashes of Mr. Kirk are ?lot t1zere. His
successor, the Rev. Dr. Cochrane, in his Sketches
of Picturesqtte Scenery, informs us that, as Mr.
Kirk was walking on a dunshi, or fairy-hill, in his
neighbourhood, he sunk down in a swoon, which was
taken for death .'' ' ' After the ceremony of a
Th e A rca n e Tra dition 133
,,·,·uaing funeral," writes Scott, " the form of the
(,:,.,. Robert Kirk appeared to a relation, and
•u111111anded him L

" ' dirk which he holds in his hand, I may be
,,..tored to society ; but if this is neglected, I am lost
l11r ever'. True to his tryst, Mr. Kirk did appear
,at the christening and 'was visibly seen' ; but
l ltwhray was so astonished that he did not throw his
d11 1-. over the head of the appearance, and to society
1\Ir. Kirk has not yet been restored." It is still
lwlwved in the neighbourhood that Kirk was spirited
.•w.ty by the fairies.
Kirk, as Lang points out, treated the world of
l.wry as "a mere fact in nature" , his Presbyterianism
wet withstanding. He did not believe the dwellers in
l.e11 \ land to be the dead, but aery spirits, ''an
.•1, .tausc people," the forerunners of our more
·.~th·.tantial race. Indeed, he speaks of the Elves as
tlu Ht).{h he were describing the denizens of the Astral
I'l.uw, and their K ingdom as that plane itself. But
till' point for us is that in order to get into communion
w1da these beings it was essential for a man to under-
'~" .1 particular ceremony of initiation into "the

ow this, I suggest, is an account not of something
'"'·•g-inary, but of the long-preserved ritual of a
lwt 1·ditary cult whose members actually or professedly
,,.,.,,. able to communicate with and enter some other
pl.tlle resembling that Amzwn of which T aliesin's
111ystical poem speaks, a long descended Keltic rite
•,f 'wcult potency, recognized as practicable by men
lt \'ing only 137 years ago.
I have followed Kirk so long because I desired to
tnclicate the presence and survival of what I believe
tn have been a definite tradition of contact with
utother plane, through the medium of a certain cult
111 d··scent from the ancient British mystics. But
lwfore leaving him, there are one or two points which
I •.hould like to allude to more particularly, although
I shall later return to the whole question of the
·.urvival of the ancient cults in Britain. H e tells us
tltal ' 'if invited and earnestly required, these
(·,.111panions make themselves known and familiar to
1111'11 : otherwise, being in a different State and
Jo'l,·ment , they neither can nor will easily converse
wtth them.'' This reveals the fact that a certain
tllttal of invocation was employed to get en rapport
wtth the "fairy" world. Again, it is stated that men
'u •·a-:ionally employ stratagems "for procuring a
l'tiv.tc·y to any of these l\1ysteries." This seems to
111dwale that mysteries were held , that these were in
lu11· of descent from the ancient British mysteries,
·''"' thaL they were frequented and continued by
I'''''Pil' who actually were , or believed themselves to
J.,.. iniLiates. Such a condition of broken-down
'"' ·aic.:ism, or mysticism employed for evil purposes,
136 Th e Myster ies of Brita in
was undeniably in use in connection with the cult of
witchcraft, as we shall see later.
Finally, as regards the places in which these rite•.
and mysteries may have been held, certain writen.
believe them to have been the "Fairy Hills" 0 1
"howes" in various parts of Scotland. Indeed tht'
late Mr. David MacRitchie in his T estim07tJ' of
Tradition put forward the theory that the Picts wen"'
a dwarfish race dwelling in such hills and earth-houses
and were mistaken for fairies or brownies by Kirk
and others. Referring to the Fairy Hill at Aber-
foyle, where Kirk lived, Mr. MacRitchie writes:
" How much of this <
howe' is artificial, or whether
any of it is1 remains to be discovered."' It is much
larger than most artificial tumuli, and like most of
such mounds, is probably sepulchral. T ales and
legends of the entrance of humans into "fairy"
mounds where they were instructed in supernatural
secrets are so numerous as to defy description.
To return to Arthurian literature. Tts more
modern phase, the Anglo-Norman, holds a very
considerable amount of proof of the survival of a
belief in early British mysticism1 but that part of iL
which has an arcane significance is contained in the-
legends of the Holy Grail, with which I shall deal
in the following chapter.

CHAPTER VI
THE MYSTERY OF THE GRAIL
So~rE recent writers, among them Miss Jessie L.
Weston, who speaks with authority, have given it as
1hcir opinion that the legend of the H oly Grail,
although of British origin, has certainly been
sophisticated by Oriental or alien ideas. That may
I1
c so, so far as its later elements are concerned, but
in its early form it is demonstrably of British
provenance, as I hope to prove in this chapter. I
also wish to demonstrate that the legend is in direct
.tssociation with the secret mystical tradition of our
i-;land, of the existence of which I have already
.tfforded considerable proof ; that it has indeed a unity
with and was drawn from that venerable body of
nccult belief which I believe is capable of rescue for
the use of British mystics.
As I have shown , the poem of T aliesin on " The
Spoils of Annw11" dec;cribed the descent of a body
of initiates or mystics into the lowest plane or circle,
£or the express purpose of recovering therefrom the
cauldron of Pwvll, the Lord of Amlwn. In that
poem Pwyll a1
;d Pryderi , his son, are associated
together by name, and the cauldron is found at a
place called Caer Sidi or Caer Pedryvan, "the Four-
cornered Castle" in the Isle of the Active Door.
Now in Norman Grail romances the Grail is said to
be in the keeping of Pelles or Peleur, merely
Normanized forms of Pwyll, in the Castle of
Carbonek, which is merely Caer Bannauc, the
137
138 Th e Mys t e ri es o f Britain
"peaked'' or "horned" castle, having reference to
the points or corners of Caer Sidi. '
The vessel which Arthur and his companions
recover from Annwn is described in the Taliesin poem
as a cauldron, the rim of which is set with pearls.
The fire beneath it was kindled by the breath of nine
maidens, oracular speech emanated from it, and it
would not cook the food of a coward. Compare this
with the description of the Grail in the Norman
romances, where Pelles and his brother are
mentioned. The Grail, when it appears, supplies
them at the table with whatever kind oE food each
desires, but the unworthy were not permirted to
remain ncar it or to approach it without hurt to
themselves. Those who worship at the Grail
Chapel of Peleur remain young, and to them the
p<lc:;sage of time signifies nothing. The Grail, coo,
heals the sick and wounded. It is thus obvious
enoug~ that the Grail was nothing more nor less than
the magic cauldron of Pwyll given a later Christian
interpretation.
The Grail is said to have been brought to Britain
b~r J oseph of Arimathea, who collected the hlood of
Christ in the vessel and conveyed it to the \Vest, or
gave it to one Bron or Brons to convey thither.
Brons, it is dear, is merely Bran the Blesc;ed of
Welsh literature. Brons, sailing from Palestine, is
said to have noated across on a shirt tak€'n from
Joseph's Son. But this is nothing but a later
'' re-hash'' of the voyage of Bran to Ireland, to whic-h
he is said to have been wafted. Bran, too, or rather
his mystical head, which in his legend takes the plac-e
of the Grail, provides in Welsh myth banquet and
mirth for eight years to his funeral bearers. Rhys,

111 speaking of the soundness of the comparison,
1c-marks : '' We have in reality to go further : it is
tult a case of similarity so much as of identity. T he
voyage of Bron is but a Christian version of the
voyage of Bran, and one cannot be surprised to find
one of the romances of the Quest of the Holy Grail
·;tating that the vessel was in the keeping of Bron,
represented a!'i dwelling 'in these isles of Ireland' .''
In the Mabinogion story of Kulhwch and Olwen,
Kulhwch is commanded by the giant Yspydaden to
procure for him the Mwys, or dish of Gwyddno
( ~aranhir. This trencher or platter was capable of
feeding all the world, nine at a time, and it was
1hought to ha,·e disappeared with Merlin along with
1he other treasures of Britain "when he entered the
Glass H ouse in Bardsey."
But I wish to make it clear that 1 am here
concerned with the Grail romances only in so far as
they reveal evidences of the survival of native British
mystical tradition. T hat the Grail tradition was
diverted to Christian purposes and therefore
penetrated and sophisticated by Christian and
Oriental influence is admitted, but with this side of
the inquiry J have logically no concern, even with
the thenry that the Keltic Church in Wales employed
the Grail legend to combat the pretensions of the
Roman pontiff to British ecclesiastical hegemony.
\Nhat I look for is evidence of the survival of the
original native occult tradition associated with the
Grail in its form of a cauldron of inspiration situated
on another plane, to reach which initiation into a
mystical or Druidic brotherhood was essential.
We have seen that there is actually traditional
continuity between the Taliesin poem of " T he Spoils
of Annwn" and the Grail legends, that the one arose
out of the other, that the Grail was in the first place
140 The Mys t e ri es of Britain
the cauldron of inspiration of a Druidic cult before it
was thought of as the dish which held the blood of
the Redeemer. In one of the later romances it is
described as a salver containing a head, in another as
a reljquary, again as a " dish" or cup. It matters
not in what form it may appear in Christian
symbolism, as it still indubitably retains thaein the
eucharistic character of its new forms notwith-
standing the clearest evidences of its "pagan" or
Druidic origins as the Keltic cauldron of inspiration
and plenty, the cauldron of the Dagda, of Keridwen,
of Pwyll. Even its Anglo-Norman name, Graal, a
dish made o[ coslly materials used for purposes of
festival, is merely a translation of the Keltic word
mowys or tnms.
In a striking passage on the folklore antecedents
of the Grail, i\Ir. A. E. Waite writes:'
The antecedents of folklore pasl>cd into the literature
of the Graal undergoing great transmutations, and so
also did certain clements of old Druidism merge into
Christianity; Rite and Myth and Ooctrine were tinged
by Tradition and Doctrine and Rite for th;ngs which
co-exist tend to do\·etail, at least by their outer edges;
and there are traces, I think, of a time when the priest
who said mass at the altar was not only a Druid at heart,
but in his heart saw no real>on also for the Druid to be
priest any less. Long after the conversion of the Celt,
enigmatical fables and mystic.,J Rites lingered in Gaul
and Britain, and if one could say that the Cauldron of
Ceridwen was a vessel of pagan doctrine, then in an
equal symbolical sense it became a ves!>el of hotch-potch
under the strang\! cegis of the Celtic Church. There were
masters of mysteries and secret science, whose knowledge,
it is claimed, was perpetuated under the shadow of that
Church and even within the pale thereof. The Bardic
Sanctuary, by the evidence of some who claimed to speak
in its namt·, opposed no precious ~:on~.:calcd my~tcries, and
perhaps on its own part the Church received into its
alembic much that was 1101 of its matter, expecting to
convert it therein and turn it out in a new form. In

142 Th e Mys t e ri es o f B rita in
which in another Welsh tale was said to have been
drawn from the waters of its lake by the god or hem
Hu. Now in an ancient Welsh poem, " Cadait
Ceridwen", or " The Chair of Keridwen" ,• the
goddess mentions this animal as follows :
I saw a fierce contiict in the vale of Beaver, on the
•
day of the Sun, at the hour of dawn, between the binb
of Wrath and Gwydion. On the day of Jove, they (tlw
birds of Wrath ) . ecurely went to Mona, to demand a
sudden shower of the sorcerers; but the goddess of the
silver wheel,• of auspicious mien, the dawn of serenity,
the greatest restrainer of sadness, in behalf of the Britons,
speedily throws round his hall the stream of the Rainbow,
a stream which scares away violence from the earth, ancl
causes the bane of its former state, round the circle of
the world, to subside. The books of the Ruler of the
Mount record no falsehood. The Chair of the Preserver
remai ns here; and till the doom, shall it continue in
Europe.
Thus the Avanc and Keridwen, goddess of the
cauldron, are associated, and the whole passage·
unquestionably relates to a part of the ceremony of
initiation into the rites of Keridwen, goddess of the
cauldron of inspiration, a passage referring to the
strife between sun and storm, order and chaos, and
one which could be equated Erom the rituals of more
than one secret tradition.
Next the castle visited by Peredur, and which is
obviously the Castle of the Grail and the Fisher King
(for the Welsh version is later and probably borrowed
much of its "machinery" from Norman sources) is
merely the Palace of Caer Sidi or Caer Bannauc, tht>
royal seat of Annwn, the centre of the mysteries of
the Astral Plane, where the cauldron of inspiration
(or Grail) was kept. Here he meets the owner of
the Castle, his uncle (the " Fisher King" of the Grail
versions) who was watching his men fishing in the

I '""t·mans , which, as Rhys has shown,' are merely
1 1 •1 1uptions of the name of Gwyn, son of Nudd, King
••I the demons of the Otherworld. Now Gwyn, in
We·lsh myth, has a brother or companion Gwydno,
whn'>e name seems to have meant " Tall Crane", or
'' "'t.dlcing Person", and he was famous as the owner

found in a Welsh manuscript of the end of th•
thirteenth century, so that at that relatively late dat~
we find the initiation story of the Annwn Plane
somewhat garbled, perhaps, but still flourishing, i
with a Christian interpretation.
The Conte del G·raal of Robert de Barron and hi!
continuators, commenced about the thir<t'quarter o:
the twelfth centllry, is "a composition", says Rhys,
'' which cannot help striking a student of Welsh
literature and mythology as one of the oldest in point
of time and allusion within the whole cycle of Grail
romance." It says of the Rich Fisher : " much
knew he of black art, more than an hundred times
changed he his semblance".
Now the whole turning-point and key of the Conte
del Graal is connected with the mystic question which
Perceval fails to put to the Fisher King, the
"suppressed word" I as Mr. vVaite calls it. " In the
Conte del Graal," he writes, =" the Law and order of
the Quest is that Perceval shall ask the meaning of
these wonders which he sees in the pageant at the
Castle of the Quest." 1 he prime question he
should have put to the sick Fisher King was : ''Unto
whom one serveth of the Graal ?'' and this query
would have released the King from his mystical
dumbness and have permitted him to pass on the
translation of the Secret Words, the keys of the
mystery he conserved, and have dispelled the
Enchantment of Britain. Because he did not ask the
question Perceval was assailed with reproaches.
If we look a little more closely into the story of
the Lame Fisher King and his brother we find
plenty of evidence that they are the people of the
Underworld well defined in myth. In the first place,
the ruler of H ades is frequently lame, and Vulcan,

The three properties of the cauldron-incxhoustibility,
111:-piration, and n.:~eneration-may be summed up in one
\\Cif(l, fertility; and it i!-> significant that the ( lri:.h) god

In fact the whole myth explains the bringing of
the mystical tradition, the Essence of Divine Life, and
all that it implied from another plane, just as domestic
animals such as the pig, the dog, and the deer were
also brought £rom that plane, or as lire was thought
of as having been brought from heaven by
Prometheus, or cattle from ' ' Fairyland''. 't.ong
afterwards, as folk-tale assures us, the notion
lingered that all good gifts emanated from the Under-
world, and many are the stories told of men and
women who penetrated the fairy-hill to gain either
hidden lore or magical objects, as we shall see when
we come to consider the subject in its folklore aspect.
In numerous instance.
•:; these had first to lose their
senses, to become unconscious or fall asleep before
admittance to the fairy realm. The Grail legends
are merely Christianized versions of this theme,
glorified and sanctified to fit them to the more exalted
aim. They enshrine the remains of an ancient
British code of initiation deflected to the uses of
Chri~tianity.
We have seen that in some versions of the Grail
legend Peredur or Perceval is told by the Fisher
King that he must not ask the reason of anything he
beholds, whereas in the others he is blamed for
refraining from putting the question. The second is
manifestly a perversion o[ th<' first, obviously designed
for later religious reasons. T o ask the reason of any
mystery in the Land of Enchantment or to put
questions to any enchanted pC'rson is speedily to meet
with disaster. It is a relic of an ancient system of
taboos. Peredur must not interrogate the King of
An.wwn on matters relating to the mysteries of the
Underworld, simply because the replies to these
would instantly have placed that ruler's occult power
in the hands of another.

·rhe Grail as a cauldron may for a moment attract
""r :lltention. The cauldron is a !'ymbol of the
llt.tgi<tll brew, and as such has its later counterpart
111 the witches' cauldron. Now £rom one point of
'ic·w the cauldron is obviously, besides being the
w 111bol of inspiration, plenty, and fertility, the
.,, mhoI of A mrwn itself, the region or plane in which
llll' lower life which was sooner or later to overHow
111111 A bred, the earrh-plane, seethed and bubbled.
II is the symbol of life, psychical as well as physical,
l!''rminating and evolving. Moreover, the myth of
Arthur's journey to Anmuu is an allegory of the
,,.,<"Cnl from Anmvn, through initiation, into A bred.
l'he ''life'' which seethes in the cauldron of Pwyll is
ll'llloved by the initiates to a higher plane. It is
nl•,•iously a myth of the evolution of life and spirit
lrnm a lower to a more exalted sphere. It follows
1hat there was probably a similar story, now lost, of
lltt· evolution of soul-life from A bred to Gwynvyd,
tlw sphere of immortal beings, the whole composing

C H A PTER V II
THE SECRET TRADITION IN RITE AND LEGEND
THE ancient serret tradition of Britain survives in a
fragmentary manner in numerous legends, local
customs and festivals, in curious rites connected with
such localities as holy wells and in other manifesta-
tions. It is, of course, questionable how far some of
these are associated with the ancient occult tradition
of the island, and many of them may be merely
survivals of the popular beliefs which constituted its
baser side, bearing, indeed, the same relationship to
the philosophical part of it, the official cult. so to
speak, as do the rites of the Sudra caste of India to
Brahminism. For what was preserved by popular
favour alone could scarely have been of much mystical
value in the higher sense, or have enjoyed much
official countenance. At the same time, popular
rites and festivals may have conserved certain ideas
capable of throwing light on the Secret T radition,
especially in so far as they may be of Iberian origin.
With those which have no bearing on the Secret
Tradition we are, of course, not concerned.
In the first place, it is notable that the idea of
Annwn, the mystic plane to which Arthur and his
companions were thought to have penetrated, still
survives as a part of modern W elsh folklore. The
late Sir J ohn Rhys, in his Celtic Folklore, provides
many traditions of An11w11, how the "Plant Annwn",
or denizens of that realm, were wont to penetrate to
this upper world, hunting the souls of doomed men
148
The S e cre t Tradit io n 149
'' hn had died without baptism or penance with their
''· '" hounds. Indeed, they came into such close
, ••lll ;tc t with the sons of men that the latter were
" ' tu..Ily able to capLure one of their milk-white kine !
Strangely enough we do not ~ind any reminiscences
'" modern Keltic- folklore o[ the other planes in the
Ill\ ..;tir circle , but that merely implies that the circle
•ol l1mo.un was believed to lie much nearer that of
I l•red, the dwelling-place of man, than the others,
·'"' I that therefore communication with it was much
11 11•r<' common .
Nc•w there is som<' evidence that ArthurI in his
111, 1hnlogical aspect, r,upersedcd I or was a " surro-
~·. • 1 · · ·· of a certain Hu Gadarn 1 who, we will
' ''lll<'lnl •er, wnc; responsible for dragging the Avanc
111 mon~tc-r of the lake from his watery abyss by
" ~~'-l llS of large horned oxen. It seems, indeed, that
11 nne L
ime a complete saga must have existed of the
ll.t rr~ ing of H ell by this H u, of which the capture oE

" '·'' modern \Velc;h pe:1sanrs believe Arthur to have

Ill' '" d ll"lil the mitldlc of the sixteenth century at
1, I'·' ,., l'l.tin from several passages in English and
\V' l•.h literature. One of the objects of pilgrimage
150 The Mys t eries o [ Br ita in
in the Principality prior to the Reformation was
the image of Darvdl {~adarn in the Diocese of St.
Asaph. In a letter from Ellis Price to Cromwell ,
Secretary to H enry VJ II. , dated April 6th, 1538,
the image is described as follows :
There ys an Imag-e of Darvellgadaro within- the said
diocese, in whomc the people have so greate confidence,
hope, and truste, that they cumme ciayly a pillgramage
unto hym, somme with kyne. other with oxen or horsis,
and the reste withe money; in so much that there was
fyve or syxe hundrethc piigrimes to a mans estimacion,
that offered to the said image the fifte daie of this presente
monethe of 1\prill. The innoccnte people hath hen sore
aluryd and entiscrl to wor:;hip the saide imag-e. in so much
that there is a commyn !<ayinge as yet amongst them that
who so ever will oiTcr anic thingc to the saide Image of
Darvcllgadern, he hathe power to fatche hym or them
that so offer:; outc of Ilrll wh~n they be dampned.
Now this idol was taken to Smithfield in the same
year and burned. lL is obvious, of course, that
Darvell Gadarn and H u Gadarn are one and the
same. Besides, it was peculiarly the province of Hu
Gadarn to draw souls out of Amt'lt'11 , or "Hell".
H e was the supreme deity, who by the strength of
his emanations (his solar oxen) drew the Avanc or
beaver (the sun) out of the lake, an allegory of his
ability to rescue life £rom the darkness of the abyss.
Now all this points to the existence and function-
ing of the ancient British Trarlition in the sixteenth
century at least, for the worship of a deity like
Darvell Gadarn could not have existed in Wales
unless it were associated with a mystic brotherhood
or priesthood, without whom it would have had no
sanction or status, no binding force. And this is
rather borne out hy the fact that when the idol was
taken to Smithfield there was take-n with it a "&iar"
who bore the same name as itself, and who was also
committed to the flames. Had he been a friar in Holy
TilE IIE.\D OF HR.\:\
P o face />ll);f 15u
The Secret Tradition 151
<lrders such a fate would certainly not have been
llll'ted out to him, nor could he have borne such a
n.11ne, and it therefore appears as if he must have
lwcn not only the living representative of the god,
I111t the conservator of his mysteries and the ancient
British Secret Tradition, visited by hundreds of
pilgrims, who worshipped the idol as a quite familiar
dc·ity.'
It is also to be noticed that oxen were offered up
to this image. This not only makes it plain that it
n·presented the Hu Gadarn of Welsh myth, but that
it was identified with the sacred solar ox or bull
·•ymbolic of that deity, and which we have seen was
n·ferred to in more than one of the British mystical
poems.
Jn the superstition concerning changelings, we also
find a very distinct trace of a belief in the return of
the soul to the dreary region of Annwn. The
superstition ran that the fairies frequently exchanged
th<'ir offspring for that of human beings, leaving
hc·hind a withered and often half-idiot elf in place of
the robust human babe which they had spirited away.
As we have already seen, the belief in fairies probably
originated from the Cult of the Dead. That is, they
wPre supposed to be the (evil?) dead waiting for
rt:-birth , and that they were also associated with
All?l'ltm is positive. The changeling was thus a soul
from Amt·wn, struggling to get a hold on Abred, the
c•an!t-plane, whereas the belief that it was possible
fur the fairies to spirit children away seems to have
.1risen from the idea that the human soul, if its
''arth-journey were not satisfactory, might once more
lapse into the depths of Annwn.
In a word, the superstition about changelings is

152 T h e My s t e r i e s o r B r i t a in
undoubtedly a memory of a cult which believed in the
progression or retrogression of souls rather than in
their Lransmigratintl. For after all, there is very
little evidence that transmif,rration in its usually
accepted form was believed in by our forefathers,
whereas there is abundant proof that a great scheme
of psychic evolution underlay their theology. A
ceremony which has also obvious relationships to the
belief in the plane of A11nwn, and which, indeed,
displays the remains of mystic rites associated with
the ancient brotherhood who presided over its ritual,
is that of Hallow-e'en.
In his account of the Bards, Owen tells us that
in North Wales the first day of November was
attendPd by many ceremonies, such as lighting a
large fire and running through it, " running away to
escape from the black short-tailed sow", and so forth.
H e says :
" Amongst the first aberrations may be traced that of
the knowledge of the g reat H uon or tl1e Supreme Being,
which was obscured by the hieroglyphics or emblems of
his different attributes, so that the grovelling minds of
the multitude often sought not beyond those rcprc:.c·nta-
tions for the objects of worship and adoration. This
opened an inlet for numerous errors more minute::; and
many superstitions became attached to their periodical
solemnities and more partkularly to their rcjoil·ing fire!.

Huon is, of course, the same as Hu Gadarn, so
that here once more we rind him associated with a
rite of the Underworld, for the H allow-e'en fire
was nothing more or Jess than a symbol of that of
A·mt'ltm, as is easily proved by the reference to
the "black short-tailed sow" . The reader will
remember that the pig was one of the "Spoils of
Am1W 11", given to the earth by Pwyll. The minister
of Kirkmichael in Perthshire, writing in the Statistical
T h e S ec r e t T r ad i t i o n 153
\c m11nt, says : " Formerly the llallow Even Fire,
I lt·li(' n[ Druidism, was kindled in nuchan, various
111.1)-!it ceremonies were then celebrated to counteract
llw 111lluences of witches and demons.
''"t·ieties were formed, either by pique or humour,

"t·n· often conducted with art and fury." It is
.urd} clear enough that this rite, totally unlike the
111nre innocent amusements associated with H allow-
···c·n in more modem times, was the memorial of a
\ 1'1r ancient myth interpreted by dramatic action 1
•lc·seriptive of the attack on the fiery underworld
pl.~~te by a society or brotherhood of mystics.
I lramas of the kind were invariably associated with
d w Mysteries of the ancient world, in Greece and
I·gypt especially. And that these celebrations were

It is by no means a simple task to trace the erocl<·cl
1111dine of the mystical tradition of T3ritain in folk-
lu·li•.r anJ legend, and in many instances the
l''"fessional exponents o[ Fnlklore have made the

~~ ·~~arding all ancient beliefs as having a bearing on
'•·L!'c'tation or other rites, nt'glecting alwgcther 1he
do·•·tu·r significance which lies beneath these tales. ln
oa dl'r to prove that a recognized caste of celebrants
d11l .tclually exist within living memory, I will now
111111 to various evidences of their presence, in Wales
.11 lt·ast. ln Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of

by the applicant standing upon a certain spot near
the well while the owner of it reads a few passages of
the sacred Scriptures, and then taking a small
quantity of water gives it to the former to drink,
throwing the residue over his head, which is repeated
three times.'' Foulkes, in his En-wogiou Cymm,
published in 1H7o, says that the last person to have
charge of the \Veil was a certain John Evans.
Befort.! him a woman had offtciated there and many
amusing tales of her shrewdness were recounted.
Says Rhys in his Celtic Polklore :
A series of articles on the \Veil appeared in 1861 and
were afterwards published, I am told, as a shilling book
which I haw nntlieen, and 1hcy d~:~dt with the supers tition,

whose writings they actually preserved. A woman
attainted by the Presbytery of Penh for sorcery in
1626 stated that shC' had a book containing magical
knowle-dge which was her "Goodsire's, her Grand-
sire's, and was a thousand years old." Her son,
Adam Bell, read it to her. Again there are many
proofs, as we shall see when we come to deal with
the cult o( witchnaft, of persons being initiated into
the ritual of that cult either by their relatives or by
friends.
lt will he necessary to &<ty a word here regarding
Arthur's glass-ship, alluded to in the legend of the
d<>..scc>nt into Amrw1t. This vessel has been construed
by various authorities as a diving-bell, and so forth,
and has been equated with the boat of g-lass in Irish
myth in which Condla the Red was spirited away to
the Land of the Everliving by a fairy princess. But
I think it is obvious that the vessel has more a
spiritual than a material significance, that, indeed, it
more nearly resembles the ship of the E gyptian
Osiris, which was supposed to navigate the dark
waters of Amenti, the Egyptian Underworld. T he
two myths are, indeed, one, and obviously emanate
from a common sourc-e. This craft is, indeed, the
ship of sr>Uls, just as is the barque of Osiris, and in
this connection we may recall the myth cited by the
late Greek writer Procopius, quoted at the
commencement of this volume, in which he describes
the passage of the dead souls by ship to the shores
of Britain. This proves that a very ancient myth
actually existed relative to the bearing of the souls
of the departed into the land of darkness by means
of a ma~ncal vessel. This magical vessel was,
indeetl, the vehide bv which the astral shape was
transported into its appropriate plane, and, in the
case of Arthur and his comrades, it was obviously
Th e S e cr e t T r a d it i o n 157
,J.Ic· to transport also the astral shapes of the living
'" .111 ·xtra-terrcstrial sphere. \Vhat was the nature
••I 1hie; vessel ?
l'hat this ship had a solar significance we may hP
fttl'll y certain. The 5imilar Egyptian barque whirh
1•l111nbed the depths of Amenli was certainly of solar
•·••gm, and its symbolical significance seems to be
tl•·•l of light invading darkness, the ship of the Sun
~:nd penetrating the g loom of the world of Death or
t um-hcing.
Pl·rhaps the derivation of Caer Sidi, a part of
I1111'<1111, is, as Rhys thought, Caer Shee, "City of
tlw Fairies". IL is notable that four organs play
.trnun<.l its fire. This instrument has a long associa-
l tc 111 with mysteries, from thw:;e of Byzantium to the
pll'scnt da}, as in l\(asonry.
Searching through the detritus <Jf Folklore for
•·vulf'nces of the Secret Tradition, we have now to
••Hlsider what precisely were its associations, if any,
w11h the cult known as witchcraft. What exactly
\\ "" witchcraft, and was it intimately associated with
lh•· ancient Secret Tradition of Britain? We arc
111 •w aware that witchcraft was by no means a thing
..t hallucination, that it did not originate in the
11naginations of disgruntled old women. Research
l.:ts made it abundantly clear that, as known in the
··•''<'enth and seventeenth centuries, it was the last
••·ntaining fragment of a very ancient cult, which
prnhably had its origin in prehistoric- times. J
lwlieve it to have had its beginnings in a caste of
\\ ••men associated with horse-breeding or cattle-
•. ti·;it~g, or both, as the entire folklore of the cult ha!';
ll'tlliniscences of ~ssociation with the horse and with
d••llll'<>tic cattle. Some such caste, I think , as that
••t 1h<' Amazons of classical lore may possibly have
lwc•n the prototype of the witch cult. The tendency
158 Th e Mys t e ries o f B r ita in
of the witch to be:spell cattle, her obvious power over
Hocks and herds, and her traditional aspect as a
horse-using sorceress has led me to believe that some-
where in North-West Africa a female religion arose
out of the usages of such a body of women as I
describe, which later lost its significance with respect
to pt;tstoral affairs, and became purely and simply
magical and occult. That it was thus of " Iberian"
origin is also highly probable, and thus it was bound
to have been connected with that general aboriginal
body of faith and superstition on which Druidism was
founded, that, indeed, it represented the lower cultus
in Britain and elsewhere, an aboriginal faith.
Although we do not hear a great deal about it in
British history, there is no doubt that witchcraft, as
a more or less secret cult, persisted in Britain
throughout the ages, but I do not believe it to have
been part of Druidism or oE the Secret Tradition.
Rather was it a debased remnant of that still older
Iberian magic which to some extent Druidism
embraced, but which it also superseded and perhaps
tried to weed out. As Sir James Frazer has shown
in his Golden Bough, the Druids seem to have
burn~d animf.lls whom they believed to be witches in
disguise, and a jortio1·i, it seems probable that they
also burned sorcerers, male or female, on occasion.
The Druidic priestesses of whom we read, those Eor
example of the Island of Sena, or oE Anglesey,
although perhaps acting as a separate female caste,
do not appear co have been of the character of
witches. There is, however, one connection between
the nine muse-like maidens who kept the Cauldron
of Keridwen warm, and who have been identified
with the priestesses of Sena, and the cult of more
modern witchcraft, and that is the Cauldron itself.
But was the witch's cauldron of tradition the same
Th e Sec r et Tra diti o n 159
' • 1hat nf Keridwen? The Cauldron of Keridwen
\\ ,,., nbviously a vessel of inspiration, whereas the
•.tttlclron of the witches was a vessel for the brewing
..1 poisonous concoctions. W e will remember,
IHtwever, that the contents of Keridwen's Cauldron
we-re of a poisonous nature with the exception of the
lu ...t three drops which sprang from it, and this would
·•·c·m to link it with the magical vessel of the witches.
I do not believe, however, that this cauldron was
, ,iginall} part and parcel of the witch's magical
·•pparatus. ( rather incline to trunk, as the evidence
tc·nds to show, that it had been adopted by the
uwmbers of me Witch-cult from that which conserved
1he Secret Tradition.
For these and other reasons I do not think that the
witch-cult had any connection, official or otherwise,
wtth that of Druidism or the Secret Tradition. I
•·•lht' r believe , as I have already said, that it arose
nttt of the ancient aboriginal or Iberian body of gross
.nperstition once existing in Britain, Gaul and Spain.
Hnt it seems to me extremely probable that it
lu •rrowed much from the cult of the Secret Tradition,
t•specially as regards some of its ritual practices,
which it would debase and turn to evil uses.
i\l any of the magical acts of the witches are
11lt·rnical with those which are alluded to as having
lu·c·n practised by the Druids , such as levitation, the
1.11sing- of storms, the use of herbs, transformation
tlltn animal shapes and so forth, and it may be that
llw lower cac;tc.... of official Druidism actually employed
··l•atagems of the kind which they had borrowed from
tlw practitioners of the aboriginal religion for the
purpose of overawing the people , just as the earliest
( :11ri~rian disciples in Britain and elsewhere seem to
l1
.1vt· used a t"ertain amowll of low-caste black magic
lor .1 !>imilar purpose.
160 Th e Mys t er ies o f Brita in
'vVe now c-ome to evidence which makes it plain
that a strong leaven of the old Druidic cult, tht·
vehicle of the Secret Tradition, survived until whal
may be called comparativf'ly rec-cnl times in Scotland.
As late as r 649 ln 1678, according to the records of
the Presbytery nf Dingwall, bulls were sacrificed in
the parish o( l~airloc-h in Ross-shire and oblations of
milk poured on the hills.
The Rev. Jame-, Ruc;t, minister of Stains. in his
Druidism Exlw.mcd. published in 187 I, provides the
fullowing vaiLJahlc- c·videnc-e of the c;urvival of Druidic
hdi<'f in eight('enth century Scotland.'
A:. there was in the .,cvcntccnth cclllury a number
of supcr,;titions pn:\'~ik·llt in Scotland. .,._ well a~ in
England, which hacl come into Lcing in Popil'h time.-..
:ts well a-. a numuer whid1 had had an existence heforc
Popi!'h times, helon~ing to the cnrlicr sp;tcm of religion,
the Druidical, and which hud hl·en tolerated, conni,·ed at,
or at lca"t not extirpated. the Gencrnl Assembly of the
Church of Scotland resolved 10 take action ag-ainst them.
As tlw most of Lhcsc superstitions, tlwy :mid, proceeded
from ig-noranr<-, they rl"•Olved that the most strenuous
t'n·ortl- l-hould he made 1hroug-hout Sc·orland for hringing
education to the doors of all, even of the poorest, by the
erection ancl extension of Parochial Schools, and by
ur~ing- 1hat 11ihles should be posses.,cd in every family,
and the inmates taug-ht to read them. But besides this,
they appointed a Commis..,ion. The (~cneral Assembly of
t649 approving of a recommendation of the As~embly
tb.tf, appointed a large Commission of their own number.
Along with the Ministers appointed, there were Sir
Archibnld j ohnston of \Varristoun, "Clerk Register" ;
;\lr. Thomas • icholson. "His ~fajcsty'c; Ad\'ocate" ; ~rr.
Alexander Pierson, one of the ordinary ''Lords of Session",
~ir Lewis Stewart, l\lr. Alexander Colvill, and ~lr. James
Robcrt:.on. "Justice Deputes"' ; ;\lcs:.rs. Rodg-er Mowet,
John (;ilmoir, and John Nisbet, "Lawyers'' ; with Doctors
Sibhald, Cunninghame, and Pun•cs, "Ph,·sicians". And
they did "ordai~ the said brethren to make •·cport of t11e
rc-.uh of their consultations and conference~ from time
lo time, as they make any conl>iderable prog ress. to the
Commission for public affairs. And the said Commission
I PP• 38 ff.
Th e Secret T raditio n 161
...hall make report to the next General Assembly". Among
other matters, to which they directed their attention, were
'he Druidical customs ohscrvcd at the fires of Beltane,
1\lidsummer, Halloweven, and Yuil. All these customs
and fires were ordered to be abolished. They succeeded
rmtwardly among the old, although the youth of the
o
·ountry still enjoy in many places some of these same
cu::.toms and fires, although they have forgotten the object
of their institution, and of course the superstition itself.
They directed their attention to the Remains of Druidical
Super::.tition and Sorcery practised at the old places of
worship, dedicated not only to the greater, but to the
lesser gods, the familiar spirits , the household divinities,
or demigods of the ancients, who, as was supposed,
could he consulted, and could g rant charming powers to
their votaries, at those pieces of ground which the Druids
had consecrated to them, and which had continued for
thousands of years untilled. These were ordered to be
t•ulti\'atcd under severe church censures and civil penalties,
church and state then acting hand in hand in the matter.
As one of the results of this Comrni::,sion, we find some
most important minutes in the Kirk Session Register Book
of Stains, stating that inquisition was made by the mini-
ster and Elders of Slains,-as must have been done by
other 1\fini::,ters and Se!-.sions,-into old Druidical super-
stitious practices and place.-. within the parish. And
from that inquisition, we learn that within Slains there
were different pieces or land dedicated 10 the <.lemi-gods
of the Druids, those imps who became the little elfin tricky
semidemons of the Christians; and that these places were
called after those fancied creatures by words both of
Lowland Scots and Highland Gaelic, as the Guidmanes
fa uld, and Garlet, or Garleacl1d, connected with Garlaoch,
An Elf.
From entries in the Kirk Session Register Book
of the Parish of Stains we find that several persons
were " delaytit" or summoned before it for practising
pagan rites in connection with hallow fires and
refusing to till the ancient D ruidical fields.
Here then we have the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland onlx_ 280 years ago, or but four
" lifetimes" since, fully persuaded that Druidism was
being practised all over Scotland, and taking steps
to put it down. How those steps were received by
L
162 T he My s t e r ie s o f B r i t a i n
their congregations is probably well illustrated by
.i\lr. John Buchan's most interesting novel Witc/1
Wood.
ln writing further of i:he antiquities of his parish,
Mr. Rust deals with the belief that i:he spirits of the
Keltic past were wont to manifest themselves on
occasion to the people in old times, who were not
infrequently decoyed into the recesses of the earth.
There was at least three places within the Parish
of Stains dedicated to the "Good People", and these
remained uncultivated in the midst of cultivated
ground until the beginning of the nineteenth century.
" It continued also to be employed for generations
for magical superstitious purposes, after the other
Elfin places had been destroyed, desecrated , or
cultivated by authority. I knew the woman, Mary
Findlay, who died a few years ago at a great age,
who was the last person laid down in infancy at the
Cairn, because she was supposed to be an Elfin
Changeling."
But let us examine what he says regarding the
Lykar Cairn :
Lykar Cairn lay eight hundred yards N.N. E. of the
Parish Church in the south angle formed by the Castle
Road, where it diverges from the Turn-the-neuk Road,
in a small valley surrounded by natural eminences or
knolls, the most striking of which, and to the base of
which it was nearest, is Maidscmaoif!lre, which means
"The knoll of the very great caldron". It comes from
Ma.id..sc, fern. "A knoll, lump, or hillock" : and m.a., a
comparative with a superlative meaning, of mor, great,
and aighc, a genitive of ugf1a1m, fern. a C<lldron. This
will turn out, as we shall find, to have the same meaning
as Bennachie, and it will contribute lo make a most
interesting disclosure of the Druidical relig ious system.
We shall therefore reserve the further consideration of
this till we come to consider under a distinct branch,
and in a subsequent part, the Utensil or Structure called
"The Caldron", so much celebrated in Welsh Mythology,
but of which no notice has been taken in Scotland,
The S ec r e t Tradit ion 163
;.!thoug-h we might upon the smallest n·Oection have
.uaticipated that what prcvailccl, or existed in the one place,
dad so originally in the other.
So the Cauldron of Keridwen was associated with
tlw survival of Druidic belief in Scotlant.l so lately
.•.. the dose of the seventeenth century! Mr. Rust
l'''iaus out that this name ''the Cauldron'' is con-
n•·< ted with numerous localities in Scotland, at
t\l1erdeen (Kettle-hill or Cadhal, a cauldron), where,
·" •·urdtng to loc-al tradition, the cauldron "was made
1'¥ the Picts", and was used by large crowds " for
'··ligious purposes''. Place-names, too, in which
•·11ter the word Aden, E den or Edin, as in
Edinburgh, were, thought Rust, connected with the
•ult of the cauldron, from the Gaelic Aidheann, "a
··auldron, kettle, or goblet".
" The drinking of the water of this cauldron,"
..ty<> l\Ir. Rust, " was one of the rites of the
Novitiate's Initiation into the Druidical mvsteries
.111d craft, after twenty years of hard study. . It was
the previous hard study, and not the caldron decoc-
t ion, which made him so great an adept in the
I)ruiclical art and science, and opened up futurity to
his view. The Novitiate promised to the admitting
II i<'rophant and his three accompanying Druids,
d11ring the dark hours of night, that he would be
f:tithful to the Druidical caste. And the most fearful
oaths were undertaken by him, and as dreadful orgies
goue through by him. "
" In Bennachie, a Druidical locality," says Rust,
"i<> the 'Maiden Casay', or Mha-adhann-cas.-'lch,
'The Great Cauldron Ascent', and 'The Maiden
Stt"ne'. or Mha-adhann-lia, 'The Very Great
Cauldron Stone' , the Cauldron on which has been
n·moved, probably when the modern road was
funned.'' But upon the stone itself is incised a figure
164 The Mysteries of Britain
which Rust believed to be a representation of the
Cauldron itself. " The Structure," he says,
'' according to the figure, allowed the Aames to play
below and around the Caldron, which was always
seething with its mysterious and wonder-working
contents. It is," says Rust, "the holy Caldron,
the Caldron of knowledge and initiation, for it has
rhe Z figure passing through it. This Z figure has
been erroneously styled sometimes the Broken
Spear, and sometimes the Broken Sceptre, and
because neither of these was satisfactory it has been
sometimes called by others just the Z figure, because
it resembles that letter of the alphabet ; and they
could not think of anything else upon which they
could agree. But that Figure is just the zigzag
lightning of Heaven, drawn down by the Druids,
who pretended to be possessed of this divine power.
By this, they alleged, they produced the real celestial
fire, which they sold to their votaries for domestic
purposes at so dear a rate, but, according to their
accounts and belief, so worthy of the price. This
belief in the Heaven-produced fire was firm, deep,
and universal."
That pagan rites in Scotland were regarded as
"common usage" is rendered clear enough from a
passage in the Chronicle of Lm11ercost (Bk. II , ch.
viii), from which it appears that John, the parish
priest of lnverkeithing, in Fife, was cited before his
bishop in I 282 for having celebrated Easter W eek
''according to the rites of Priapus'' by collecting tht·
maidens of the town and making them dance round
the figure of the phallic deity, singing the while'.
He pleaded the "common usage of the country" ami
was allowed to retain his benefice. This is precis(•ly
what was done, so far as the date was concern<'d,
by the priest of Darvel Gadarn in Wales, who
T be Secret T r a d it io n 165
•(·lt~Lrated his highest rites on AprLI 5th, Easter Day.
!'here is no doubt that the stern battle of the early
1
'-chic Church for a separate Easter arose out of
1·-;pccial veneration for a Keltic seasonal festival of
great antiquity.
lt cannot but be interesting to us to examine
l•rieny such of the Druidic rites whose details are
known in order to discover how much light these
111ay cast upon the Secret Tradition. The rite which
perhaps has been described more frequently than
any other was that of the ceremonial gathering of
the mistletoe. From the accounts of Pliny and
1\Jaximus of T yre we know that the oak tree was
sacr~d to the Kelts, and it therefore follows that the
g-athering of the mistletoe was definitely associated
with the fundamentals of their faith. The Druidical
).!'roves were composed of oak trees, and the sacred
n:remonies of the Druids were invariably graced by
the presence of oak branches. In short, the oak
tree was in itself a deity.
The mistletoe is not frequently found on the oak,
it is more apt to t\vine parasitically on the poplar and
1he willow. Its precise significance, I believe, has
l1ren altogether missed by the majority of those
writers who have dealt with this aspect of it. It has
hl'en thought LO be a sign of the especial favour of
the god, the symbol of immortality, of lightning, and
.,,, forth ! But I believe it to be the symbol of the
c·-;sence of life, regarded by the ancients indeed as
the protoplasmic material of existence.
It was culled on the sixth day of the moon. E xtra-
ordinary preparations for feast and sacrifice were
maJe beneath the tree which bore it, says Pliny, and
two white bulls whose horns had never been bound
wt're conveyed thither. A white-clad Druid climbed
tlw tree and cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle.
166 Th e Myste ri es of Britain
As it fell it was caught in a white cloth. The bulls
were then sacrificed and prayers offered up to the
god. Among the Kelts the mistletoe was known as
an "all-heal", and the liquor brewed from it was
supposed to make barren animals fruitful, a fact
which buttresses my contention that it was regarded
as the protoplasm of life. Canon MacCulloch wisely
sees in Pliny's account the description of a rite which
"was an attenuated survival of something which had
once been important, but it is more likely that Pliny
gives only a few picturesque details, and passes by
the rationale of the ritual. l [e does not tell us who
the 'god' of whom he speaks was, perhaps the sun-
god, or the god of vegetation the oxen
may have been incarnations of the god of vegeta-
tion''. I believe the god of the mistletoe and the
oak to have been that Hu of whom 1 have already
Sf?Oken. Now we will recall that the image of
"barvel Gadarn" which was burned at S mithfield
in 1538 had oxen offered up to it. I believe this
image to have been the oak tree in an anthropo-
morph1c or man-like shape. It appears to have been
of wood, anrl, of course, we know that Darvel
Gadarn was merely another name for Hu Gadarn,
the god of Plenty, invariably associated in Keltic
folklore with the ox, indeed in his symbolized form
the ox itself.
It seems probable that the mistletoe as the symbol
of the essence of life was introduced into the ritual
of initiation of the Secret Tradition just as wheat
was in that of the Eleusinian mysteries. We find
it regarded as a cure for many kinds of disorders.
It must indeed have been looked upon as the
primordial agency of life itself. Were the "pearls"
on the rim of the Cauldron of Inspiration mistletot·
berries? This may appear very far-fetched, but I

~1 uch has been written regarding the human
·..IC'ririce of the Druids. To which god or gods was
this sacrifice made? We are informed that huge
i111ages of wickerwork were erected, and that these
w1•re filled with victims, either criminals or slaves.
l"he only trace of British gods designed in wicker-
work which I c-an discover is that connected with
1he figures of Gog and Magog, the giants in the
Cuildhall. In a curious anonymous work entitled
Tlu• Gimzts i11 Guildhall, published in I 74 I , and now
c·xceedingly scarce, it is stated that the figures they
replaced in 1708 were made of wickerwork. Let
u~ look for a moment into the genealogy of Gog and
~ iagog.
In wellnigh two thousand years of existence
Imperial London has succeeded in retaining a wealth
nf folklore and legend C'juite commensurate with her
importance and celebrity. It is significant, however,
to the student of her tradition that at least eighty
per cent. of it is Keltic and pre-Keltic, and of
t'XCeedingly venerable origin. Roman, Saxon, and
Norman occupations have scarcely coloured London's
pristine and native mythology, the associations of
which are as Brythonic every whit as those of the
folk-tales of Cambria.
rndeed , London's very name seems to be referable
to certain British deities, her tutelary patrons .
Doctor H enry Bradley, a sound authority, has
t·xplained " London" as a possessive formed from
some such appellation as Londinos, derived from the
old Keltic adjective meaning "fierce", and Mr.
C ordon H ome, the recent historian of Roman
168 The Mysteries of Br itain
London, gives it as his opinion that "the only con-
clusion at which it is possible to arrive is that the
twin hills beside the Thames formed at some remote
period the possession, and doubtless the strong-
hold, of a person or family bearing the name
Londinos''.
This is sound, and clear enough so far as it goes,
but who were the " Fierce Ones" of the twin hills
beside the Thames ? 1f reference be made to the
names of other British cities more or less coeval with
London, it will at once be seen that a very consider-
able proportion of them received their names from
tutelary or guardian deities. Camulodunum, or
Colchester, is merely the dun or hill of Camulus,
the Keltic war-god, the name of Eboracum, or York,
has been traced to the Iberian divinity 1por or
H yperion, and Corinium, or Cirencester, was the
city of Corineus, an eponymous deity of the island.
T here are literally scores of examples. Thus it
seems highly probable that London was named not
after. any tribe or gens, but from a sub-title of the
gods who presided over the region.
Nor are there lacking the titles and traditions of
gods whose characteristics well merit the formidable
description preserved in the place-name. From time
immemorial, almost, the names of Gog and Magog
have been associated with the site. Its legendary
appeUation Cockaigne, as indigenous to it as
Lyonesse to Cornwall or Alba to Scotland, has time
and again been explained as " the land or region of
Gog' ', the pleasant place or paradise of the Keltic
Ogmios . Indeed, there is no dubiety concerning the
veridically British character of the twin titan-deities
Gog and Magog. Their figures were formerly
carved into the slope of Plymouth Hoe, the
Gogmagog Hills in Cambridgeshire still embalm the
T he Secr e t T r ad it io o 169
rtwllwry of their names, and the carved and painted
.t.ttucs of them which loom up at the farther end of
tlw Guildhall arc the successors of those once carried
through the streets of the capital on Michaelmas
I>ay, at the festival of the Lord Mayor's Show.
In his New View of London (1708), Hatton
.1ssures us that hackney coachmen in the City were
wont to swear "by Gog and Magog", and be further
111akes it clear that a very vivid terror inspired certain
l.ondoners, even at that late date, at the mere
mention of them. Some apprentices, he tells us,
were as " frighted at the names of Gog and Magog
.as little children are at the terrible sound of Raw-head
a11d Bloody-bones", and evinced a livelier fear of
1hem than at the prospect of being haled before the
Lord Mayor or Chamberlain. Surely a terror so
lnng-established could have survived only on account
uf an exceptionally powerful folk-memory of ancient
•..acrifices to the deities in question, and the student
,,r rradition is probably justified in equating the giants
of London with Ogmios, the fierce Keltic god of
•·loquence, who, garbed in lion-skin , and with club in
hand, drew all men after him in chains and demanded
111ore than occasional human holocausts. Magog,
the "Mother Gog", is evidently his female counter-
part, and her replacement by a male figure of
Corineus is evidently a late and faltering acquiescence
i11 the bowdlerized British mythology of Geoffrey
uf Monmouth and J ohn Milton. Probably, too, the
11ame Og, or Ogmios, became confused in later
times, and by the same "authorities", with those of
Cog and Magog, the Biblical monarchs of the Land
of Bashan. On the whole, then, it appears highly
probable that the twin hills on either side of the
Walbrook were regarded as the duns or mounts of
( >g and his consort, just as the twin rocks at the
170 T he M y s t e r i e s o f Br i t a i n
extremity of Land's End were once regarded as their
citadels.
There can be no doubt that Gog and Magog were
deities of fertility, blll it is also clear that Gog was
one and the same with the Keltic Ogmios, the god
of poetry and inspiration. Magog, it may be
inferred, was also associated with the inspirational
faculty. This would equate her with Keridwen, and
indeed 1 see no reason to think that she is not one
and the same with that goddess, who in more than
one place is described as "the old giantess". But
the importam thing for us is that in the capital of
England in pre-Roman times the rites of these
monstrous deities were actually celebrated, and that
the memory of them remained for so long. We are
informed by more th:m one writer that the people
of London in the eighteenth century almost wor-
shipped them 1 and seemed in a sense to regard them
as the palladia of the nation. Even now, were these
effigies to be removed from their ancient positions
in the Guildhall one can envisage something o£ the
anger which would ensue.
Do we not rake too much for granted thar the
passage of time utterly overwhelms ancient belief,
and that during the past century we have made such
strides in thought and progress as entirely to discount
what we label the "superstitions" of other ages?
True, there may have been during the past sixty
or seventy years a much more wholesale breakaway
from old tradition than ever before, but it is certain
that only a very few generations ago British people
were much more closely in touch with the remnants
of the faith ancillary tothe Secret Tradition thnn
many moderns imagine. Festivals like Shrovetidt·
and Yule are undoubreclly remnants of Druidic ritu:~ l 1
hut it is equally clear that they enshrine many
T h e Secret T r a d i t i o n 171
.urvivals from pre-Keltic practice. At Martinmas
'-i.ttnl Martin is said to have been cut up and eaten
til the form of an ox. This is clear evidence that
'"'I. ~ l artin merely took the place of Lhe god Hu,
wl111 was symbolized by that animal. The Irish
l'ailteann Game..c: still hold the memory of T ailtiu
1he fostermothf:r of Lug, who died in the Kalends
of August, and Lammas \Vas the ancient Keltic feast
"f Lug himself. Another ancient British rite, in all
l'robability associated with the Secret Tradition,
•.urvives in the annual celebration at Coventry of the
Festival of Godiva. Who and what precisely was
( ;odiva?
Godiva's historical existence is by no means at
•.take . Her personal reality is at once conceded.
She was the mother not onIy of the patriotic Saxon
princes Edwin and Morcar, but also oE a heroine
with associations even more romantic than her own,
l ~clith Swan-neck, wife of that Harold who fell at
~t.·nlac or H astings. But, this notwithstanding, the
•.1ory of her noble sacrifice is demonstrably of the
nar ure of legend. Roger of Wendover, who first
.dludes to it, wrote in the beginning of the thirteenlh
1 t'ntury, or about a hundred and fifty years after
dw cieath of the central figure. No previous
t·bronicler makes mention of her unsel!ish perform-
.tncc, and in the eyes of the folkloreist it embraces
·••• many circumstances obviously connected with
.tiH:ient British religious rite as makes it evident that
11 must have arisen therefrom.
It is, indeed, quite unnecessary to prove , as has
lll'cn done, that Coventry was, at the supposeci date
,,f the Countess's famous ride , a village inhabited
1.,~ some thr<'e hundred ser£.s dwelling in wooden
ltuls, that it h<ld no market-place, nor groaned under
the Lolls and taxes alluded to in the legend. But it
172 Th e Myste ries of Britain
is of importance that Godgifu or Godiva, and her
husband Leofric, Earl of \lercia, were the restorers,
if not the founders, of its monastery of St. Osburg.
For, with the restoration of this religious house, the
prosperity of Coventry as a market-town commences.
Godiva carne to be regarded as a civic benefactress,
consequently it is not surprising to find that her fame
was confounded at a later date with the myth of the
ancient British local goddess Brigantia or Brigit,
whose story, during the early Christian centuries,
had itself grown dim and confused in the popular
imagination. In the Keltic period, this divinity, or
her human representative, rode through the village
of Coventry at the period of the summer festival at
the end of May. But her feast and attributes were
in the course of time confounded with and latterly
absorbed by the legend of the fair-haired Saxon
Countess.
This is a process with which the mythologist is
well acquainted. The memory of a god wanes, and
his legend is appropriated by a later hero or saint,
with modifications of time and place. Just as in
Ireland the goddess Brigantia, with whom we have
here to deal, became the Christian St. Bridget, there
is no reason to doubt that in Coventry a similar
process took place, and that Brigantia or Brigiddu
became confused with the saintly Godgifu, the
''G d . "
o -gtven .
For our contention, the salient points of Godiva's
legend arc that she passed through Coventry
innocent of any covering save that oE her abundant
golden hair, and that in doing so, she was spied
ueon. There is good proof that the ancient Keltic
deity, or a woma11 representing her, appeared in this
condition at her annual festival ; and to spy upon
godhead, or its representative, was, of course, the
T he Secret T r ad i t i on 173
u11pardonable sin, punished with the deprivation of
··•).{ht.
That Coventry was anciently situated in a district
111 which Druidical rites were practised is generally
, unceded. At the village of Southam, hard by, the
( ;ocliva procession was formerly celebrated with a
faithfulness equal to that evinced in the larger town-
ship. But curious variations of the ceremony, even
111ore eloquent of its Druidical character than the rite
11htaining at Coventry, were celebrated there. The
1•ageant was headed by a personage known as ''Old
Brazen-Face", who wore a mask representing a
hull's head, with horns complete. At certain festivals
1he hide and head of a sacrificed bull were worn by
1he Druidic officiants, so that "Old Brazen-Face"
may well be regarded as the degenerate descendant
uf these. His name is, of course, an appellation
nf the Keltic sun-god, whose burning visage,
surrounded by lambent rays, was frequently cast in
hrazen discs. The expression " Old" is frequently
prefixed to the names of discredited deities, as in
"Old Scratch", ' 'Old H arry". Then came Godiva
in a lace mantle, followed by a second Godiva, whose
body was stained black. This, Pliny tells us, is
precisely how the women of the ancient Britons
decorated themselves on occasions of religious
festival, smearing their bodies with woad , "so that
1hey resembled the swarthy Ethiopians". At Fenny
Compton, not far from Southam, where this Godiva
rite is held, is \Voad Farm, perhaps the very site
where the plants from which the dye was made were
formerly obtained. That a preponderatingly British
•·lement has surviveci in Warwickshire has been
maintained by generations of archceologists, and what
1nore probable than that it continued the practice of
its ancient rites, placating later Christian opinion by
174 The Myste ri es o f B rit a in
their attribution to the saintly identity of a worthy
d~ughter of Mother Church ?
Coventry was formerly situated near the southern
boundaries of the great British tribe of the Brigantes,
the presiding deity of whom was the goddess
Brigantia or Brigiddu, the same, as has been
indicated, with the Irish Brigit, later Christianized
into St. Bridget. She was also known as Danu or
Anu, and is undoubtedly identical with that " Black
Annis" who was supposed to lurk in the Dane (or
Danu) H ills in Leicestershire, and to carry off
children and sheep to her cavern-a memorial of
human and animal sacrificial offerings. She was a
divinity of the earth, a goddess oE fertility, wor-
shipped almost exclusively by women. The name
" Black Annis" obviously relates to her woad-stained
appearance, and accounts for the ''Black Godiva' ' .
But how to explain ''Peeping T om'' ? The shrine
of Brigiddu at Kildare, in Treland, was enclosed by
a fence which no man might rass or peep througl1,
nor was any man permitted to gaze upon the sacred
virgins dedicated to the goddess. Thus, when one
or more of them rode through the streets of British
Coventry at the rime of the festival of the goddess,
no " Peeping Tom" dared offend, or the outraged
deity would summarily have deprived him of sight.
T o such a custom, then, we may trace the beginnings
of the Godiva legend.
There can be little doubt that this rite has a certain
bearing on the ritual of the Secret Tradition. Not
only does it show its capacity for survival, but I
think it reveals part of the representation gone
through in the initiatory ceremony, or at least that
it is associated with the ritual of the faith ancillary
to the T radition itself. Briginda was a goddess of
knowledge, she was worshipped by poets, and had
Th e ecre t Tr a dition 175
1"o sisters of the same name connected with leech-
' 1o~ft and smithwork. S he was indeed a goddess o£
••1ILUrc and poetry, and is the equivalent of the
I •.tUii!'h goddess Brigindo. The name seems to come
ltnm the Welsh root " bri", " honour" or " renown".
Iter cult until lately was known in the Hebrides,
'' here, on S t. Bride's Day, Candlemas Eve, women
•lr~ssed a sheaf of oats in female clothes, and set it
'''lth a club in a basket called " Bride 's Bed", to the
.trcompaniment "f the cry : " Bride is come ! Bride
'" welcome!" She was undoubtedly. as Canon
\lacCulloch says, "an early teacher of civilization,
llt!'.pirer of the artistic, poetic, and mechanical
faculties, as well as a goddess of fire and fertility".
It seems to me that, like Keridwen , she presided
rwer the female department of the ancient mysteries,
.ts Hu presided OH'r the male portion. In all
ltkPlihond her worship olJtained more in the north
.wd central parts of what is now England and
Sl'otland, and in Ireland. But the fact that she is
.1s-;ociatcd with wells, with inspiration, and with
:tgriculture seems to equate her almost entirely with
Kcridwen, the goddess of the Sacred Cauldron.
CHAPTER VIII
THE HIGHER PHILOSOPHY OF BRITISH
MYSTICISM
IT is now nE>cessary to turn to the higher aspects of
the Secret T radition o[ Britain as enunciated in its
most distinguished document, that Barddas already
described in a [orrner chapter, only the superficial
philosophy of which was touched upon. In the first
place it will be necessary to satisfy ourselves
regarding the notion of deity as there set forth.
God, we are told, is three things, and cannot be
otherwise : coeval with all time; co-entire with all
essence ; and co-local with all mental purpose. He
is inconceivable and incomprehensible, the greatest
and the most immeasurable of all that are together
in place.
But of what god are these statements made? It
seems probable that the Welsh bards of later times
recognized the God of Christianity as the supreme
divinity, but there are not wanting allusions to a
certain Hu whose nature has already been touched
upon.
Now concerning this Hu there is a considerable
diversity of opinion. " The meaning of H u,"
explains a note to Barddas, '' is that which is apt
to pervade, or to spread over. ft is used as an
epithet of the Deity, in reference to His omniscience,
and is not unfrequently to be met with as such in the
works of the Bards." The bard Cynddelw identifies
him with Jesus, and the annotator ventures llw
176
The Higher Philosophy 177
opmion that he was identical with the Heus' of
l.arlantius and the Hesus of Lucan, described as
·' ~od of the Gauls.
Canon 1\lacCulloch' regards him as probably ''an
old culture-god of some tribes'', and adds that the
1riads referring to him are of later date. RhysJ
·.peaks oi him as a "British Hercules", and thinks
1hat he was superseded by Arthur. In fact, very
liLLie notice has been taken of him by the official
mythologists. But it is obvious from the constant
reference to him in the triads that he was a personage
of importance, a culture-god, skilled in the arts of
husl>andry, a law-giver, probably of solar origin.
IIe is alluded to as the ''supreme proprietor of the
i~·dc of Britain", and as "a bull d\qelling in a sacred
sLall'', a statement which seems to equate him with
Osiris. Undoubtedly he is the individual alluded to
in Lhe poem of " The Spoils of Am~wn" as "the
brindled ox with the thick head-band, having seven-
srore knobs in his collar". That such an animal
was kept by the Druids as a symbol of this deity in
the same manner as the priests of Egypt kept the
Apis bull as the representative of Osiris, is proved
hy a passage in the same poem : '' They know not
what animal they (the Druids) keep of the silver
head." The name of this bull or ox seems to have
hcen Elzen, judging from a poem by 1\lerlin, and its
slaughter by the pagan Saxons is deplored by that
magus.
This not only equates Hu to some extent with
Osiris, but associates his worship with that of
Mithraism and the bull-cults oE the Mediterranean
area. Now the Gaulish god Esus, or Hesus,
mentioned previously and alluded to by Lucan, is
• Hu, in Welsh, is pronounced H<£, or He.

178 T he My s t e r i e s o [ Br i t a i n
depicted on an altar found at Paris as a woodman
cutting down a tree, and on the same altar a bull is
represented. There is a similar altar at Treves.
Pre-Roman bronze bulls have been found al
Hallstadt in Austria, and at La T ene. " Many
place-names in which the word tanws occurs, in
Northern Italy, the Pyrenees, Scotland, Ireland,
and elsewhere," says Canon MacCulloch, " suggest
that the places bearing these names were sites of a
bull-cult." H e adds that possibly the animal tended
to become the symbol of a god, a tendency perhaps
aided by the spread of Mithraism, and states that
"a later relic of the bull-cult may be found in the
carnival procession of the Bceuf Gras at Paris".'
We will also recall the sacrifice of bulls at Gairloch
and elsewhere in Britain in later times.
That H u was a culture-god symbolized by the bull
(as was Osiris) is therefore clear enough, and that
he had a common origin with the Egyptian god in
North-West Africa is also extremely probable.
Frazer, in a note to the Golden Bough, mentions
the discovery of a Druidic grave in North Africa,
complete with implements, and W estermarck pro-
vides many evidences of the survival in Morocco of
the rite of Bealtainn, a ceremony for the annual
purification of cattle by passing them through the
sacred fire or smoke.
Now we are informed in Barddas that God alone
can endure the eternities of Ceugant, and as we
know the three circles of the Keltic psychic
progression to have been depicted in solar form, as
shown on the early British coins, and, according to
some, in the stone circles at Avebury and elsewhere,
Ceugant, the dwelling of the Most High Hu, was
probably regarded as the sun itself, Gwyn'VJ'd, the
• op. dt. p. 209.
T he H i g he r P h i 1o sop hy 179
lt.lppy dwelling of immortal beings, as its outer rim,
o~nd A bred, as the outer darkness. But the drawing
nf the psychic scheme in Barddas shows A bred as
the central figure, Gwywvyd as the outer, and
l "enga"t as corresponding to the rays of the
luminary. lt may thus be that A bred or Anmvn was
regarded as a fiery solar abyss wherein all things
~crminated, a torrid and burning alembic of life.
But as A bred is obviously the earth-plane, some
mnfusion may have taken place benveen it and
Anmm1 itt the mind of the draughtsman of this plan.
Itt all probability the three psychic planes of man
were Am1w1t, the place of germinal existence, A bred,
the earth-plane, and Gwynv)•d, the plane of justified
spirits. Ceugant, the plane of God, was unapproach-
able and reserved for deity alone. That some
confusion cenainly did exist is clear from two
!:>tatements in the Book of Dwyfyddiaeth, placed side
by side, one of which bears out that the three states
of existettce of living beings are "the state of A bred
in AnnW?l ; the state of liberty in humanity, and the
state of love, that is Gwynvyd in H eaven ' '. While
the other lays down as the three necessities of all
animated existence, "beginning in Annwn; pro-
gression in A b1·ed ; and plenitude in Gwynvyd''.
The three necessary obligations of man are set
forth as suiTering, change, and choice, and his
equiproportions as A bred and Gwynvyd, necessity
and liberty, evil and good, to which he has the power
of attaching himself as he pleases. This is no
philosophy of fatalism, and as such is differentiated
from the Eastern systems and marks the growth and
acceptance of the Western doctrine of human free-
will, which , indeed, is insisted on. Yet there are
obvious associations with the doctrine of escape, as
observed in the Oriental systems, for we are told
180 T he M y s t e r i e s o f Br i t a i n
that Man does "escape" from A bred and Cythra1d
(evil) to Gwyuvyd through forgetfulness and death.
Thus former states cannot be recalled in the happier
sphere, although elsewhere it is explicitly set forth
that it is essential for perfectitude that they should be.
There are thus the three planes and no others in
our early British mystical philosophy, not seven as
in the Eastern. Nor does it seem to have been
assumed that man has numerous psychic bodies, as in
the Eastern philosophies, although, ashas been shown,
he is composed of various "materials", or elements.
In the triads of Bardism is an interrogatory wruch
throws considerable light on the early British notions
concerning the faculties of the soul. To the question
"\Vryat is conscience ?" the reply is "The eye of
God in the heart of man, which sees everything that
is perceptible in its right form, place, time. cause,
and purpose.'' Reason is explained as the revolving
of the conscience, whilst it contemplates by means
of sight, hearing , and experience whatever comes
before it, and understanding is described as the
working of the conscience whilst it exercises its
energies and might for the purpose of acquiring
knowledge.
In this questionary God is described as the life of
all lives, the spirit of God as the power of all powers,
and the providence of God as the order of orders
and the system of systems. Truth is the science of
Wisdom preserved in memory by conscience, and
the soul is the breath of God in a carnal body, whj\C'
Life is the might of God.
In The Sentences of Bardism, written by Ieu:m
ab Hywel Swrdwal, a poet who flourished about
1450, a good deal of insight is given into the Barciir
philosophy of existence. It is indeed strange to fiml
in the Wales of this particular era so much nf

T he H ig her Ph i los o ph y 181
profound thought as is contained in these sentences,
··t·lltirnents tndeed, which, if they had been known to
dli' doctors of Elizabethan London, might have
caused them to revise their opinions of contemporary
Keltic civilization! Let us glance briefly at a few
.,rthese aphorisms.
That does not but exist, we are told, from which
.cgreater amount of good than evil can be produced,
since it cannot be otherwise in virtue of God's power,
wisdom, and love. Of that which is neither good
nor bad, neither the existence nor non-existence is
'klfe for man, for nothing in reason is known of it.
Others say that it is the material of everything.
I Iowever, there is only God that knows its good and
C'vil, its uLility and inutility, whether the good or evil
he the greater. Where a great good to all, without
harm to anyone, can be comprehended, it cannot be
but that it is in existence, since otherwise the three
prmcipal attributes of God, namely, knowledge,
wisdom, and mercy, would not stand without being
opposed by distress and necessity : ''therefore
Bardism is true" .
Truth cannot be had from that in which every
truth cannot consist, and which will not consist in
every truth, for truth cannot be had from what will
contradict or withstand that which is true. The very
power of God, we are further informed, is a
guarantee that the best of all things are in existence.
"The Ten Commandments of the Bards" found
in the Blue Book have obviously been interpene-
trated by Christian thought. For example, we are
told to keep Sunday religiously and to beware of
worshipping idols, which shows that the tendency
to worship idols was actually present. But certain
passages betray the Keltic mentality. That, for
example, concerning the three deliverances- "there
182 The Mysteries of Britain
will be no transgression which will not be set right,
no displeasure which will not be forgiven, and no
anger which will not be pacified , and thence will be
obtained the three excellences : first, there will be
nothing ill-favoured which shall not be adorned ;
secondly, there will be no evil which shall not be
removed ; thirdly, there will be no desire which shall
not be attained. And from reaching this mark : in
the first place, Lhere can be nothing which shall not
be known ; there can be no loss of anything beloved
which shall not be regained ; thirdly, there can be
no end to the G7,uynvyd which shall be attained.
And it is not necessary that there should be an under-
standing might and love other than these things,
with the careful performance of what is possible.''
These latter sentiments particularly display a
Keltic bias. Possibly there is nothing Biblical about
them, and there is certainly nothing of the hard, dry
theology of the T eucon in the yearning beauty they
contain. T he core of their philosophy seems to
imply thm, the struggle of the soul notwithstanding,
all will be well in the end. They reiterate the
age-long cry of the poet that beauty cannot die, that
somewhere, even though occluded by clouds, it
awaits the spirit at the end of its journey, and that
despite human agony, there is certainty of gain at
the conclusion of the struggle. This is not fata)jsm,
nor has it anything to do with the ugly philosophy
of punishment which seems to have a peculiarly
Judaic origin and to have arisen through a survival
of early barbarous beliefs. It is indeed the philosophy
of joy, which shines through all Keltic art, however
shadowed it may seem in places.
\Vherefore, then, the struggle of man ? It seems
to me that in our native British mysticism the idea
of struggle, of evolution, is stressed more as a
Th e Hi g he r Phil oso ph y 183
uatural and necessitous course than as a series of
phases through which the human soul must pass,
almost, indeed, as an act of psychic growth, rather
than a definite rule which it must observe. The
Oriental philosophies seem to indicate that it is
necessary for man, if he would develop in psychic-
stature, co tread a certain path definitely laid out for
him, a path which may take him reons of ages ere it
lead him to the ultimate. At practically every step
of this path choice is afforded him to tread rightly
or wrongly ; but the mysticism of our fathers, or so
it seems to me, lays less of stress on choice. Man
must progress whether he would or not. True, he
may fall back into A bred time and again, but
ultimately he must gain Gwynvyd. True, there is
a belief associated with the Eastern philosophies that
in the end all life must return to God , but not only
Joes the process seem to be very much more pro-
longed, but it does not seem to be so mechanical.
T o my way of thinking Barddas postulates a species
nf evolutionary machine in which, from a low form
of existence, the soul is slowly raised to the heights
of G·wynvyd, rather than a specific scheme to which
the conduct of man is chiefly contributory. Not that
in the British system it is not contributory, but rath<'r
that man appears, in virtue of it, to receive more
assisrance from supernatural powers. It is, as l have
said, rather that he seems to be slowly born through
the planes of being into the light of G 'Zt')'" 'Vyd. than
that he arrives there entirely through his own
volition and conduct.
It is obvious, too, that enormous stress is laid
upon the value to the soul of man of scientific know-
ledge in this development, that it is indeed the lever
b,, which he raises himself from one plane to another.
This alone is proof, in its practical thrust, of a
184 Th e Myste ri es o f Bri ta in
Western origin. Good deeds doubtless assist man,
but without a knowledge of the secret sciences he
may be retarded. It looks, indeed, as if the process
were hastened through such knowledge, and therein
probably lay the desire for initiation, that is, it would
appear that:, given this initiation, man would be
assured of entrance into the plane of Gwynvyd, and
that without it he might possibly fall back into A bred.
This scheme of things notably resembles the
Egyptian idea that without a knowledge of The
Book of the Dead the human soul could not hope to
gain paradise.
So loosely are the tenets of our ancient mysticism
set down that it is extremely difficult to systematize
them. They are, for the most part, cast into Triads
or groups of three, after the manner of the Welsh
bards, and frequently in an arbitrary fashion though
never altogether incoherently. The juxtaposition of
some of these aphorisms, too, is often irrelevant. It
is therefore necessary to cull from the mass that
which seems important and to the point.
The three laws of man's actions are set forth as
necessity, choice, and judgement, according to what
is possible, for ever in the circle of Gwynvyd. There
are three things, we are told, which are to be found
everywhere : C'rod, truth, and the Circle of
G·wynvyd, and to know this is to be united with
them and to have deliverance from Abred. There
are agnin three things the magnitude of which cannot
be known, the Circle of Ce11gant, the plane of the
existence of God alone, the length of eternity, and
the love of God.
The three principal vigours of man are set forth
as A·wen, affection, and intellect, from which tri::.d
all goodness proceeds. All the efforts of man shnulcl
be in unison with that which is in the Circle of
T he H ig her P h iI o sop hy 185
Gwynvyd. There are three grades of animation :
(~od in Ceugant, spiritualities in Gwynvyd, that is
" H eaven", and corporalities in Abred, that is an
water and earth. Here we have the Circle of
Gwynvyd absolutely identified with the Christian
Heaven, and A bred with earth rather than Ammm.
!\ note to this passage states that :
1
' Some persons
profess to discover indications of the doctrine of
A bred or the metempsychosis in the H oly Scriptures,
thus they say that the passage in Job (ch. xxxiii, v.
29-30): ILo, all these things worketh God often-
times with Man, to bring back his soul from the Pit,
to be enlightened with the L
ight of the living' , ought,
according to the H ebrew, to be rendered : ' Lo, all
these things worketh God with Man, and thrice to
bring back his soul from the Pit'." This may be
so, yet still, as I have said, I find nothing of the
doctrine of transmigration in our ancient mysticism,
rather that of evolution, or psychic development.
\Ve come next to the three conditions to which
the nature of existence and animation is subject :
efficient, as with God and H is powers; effected, as
is the case with finite vitalities and mixed beings ;
and non-effective, that is what was not made "and
will not make'' I as space, absolute time, mortality,
and darkness. These conditions are postulated in
another way as follows : ·~ What has not been made,
that is God ; what has been made, that is the living
and motion ; what has not been made, that is the
motionless dead." It is curious to find the theory of
relativity introduced into these ancient triads, where
the existence of aQ.solute time and space are denied
-another instance in which, I take it, the vVelsh
bards were greatly in advance of thought of con-
temporary Europe.
The three stabilities of oneness are given as
186 The Myste ri es or R rit a in
universality, for there can be no two kinds of one
universality, infinity, for there can be no limits to
one whole, nor can anything he whole which is not
universal nor omnipresent, for that is not one whole
which is not all-comprehensive ; and immutability,
for it is impossible that there should be one con-
junctive, universal, entire and all-existent, otherwise
than they are ; therefore there can be no God but
from fundamental and universal oneness.
The manner in ..vhirh the end of A bred or the
earth-plane will be ac-celerated is set fonh not so
much prophetically as with an air of scienti1ic
exactitude. Three things, we are told, will
accelerate its conclusion : diseases, fighting, and
becoming eneidvaddeu, which has already been
explained as a state of being legally punished for
offence. But "eneidvaddeu" in this instance implies
a state of punishment which has been justly and
reasonably brought about, for example, by war or
conflict carried out in a just cause. \Ve are told that
it was for the benefit of and out of mercy to living
beings that God ordained the mutual fighting and
slaughter which takes place among them, a doctrine
which, we will remember, was stressed with no little
weight by Wordsworth. H owever the modern
mind recoils from such a belief, it seems to have
commended itself to our British ancestors as a short
cut from the miseries of the plane of Abred, and this
strengthens my theory that the philosophy set forth
in Barddas by no means found its origin in any of
the Oriental systems, which not only prohibit
slaughter and regard the taking of life as blasphemy,
but rather look upon life as a painful experience t(l
be overcome more by a good train of thought than
anything else. Moreover the doctrine in questin11
shows most distinc-tly its Druidic origin, for tlw
Th e H ig he r Phil oso ph y 187
Druids, although at times they seem to have
intervened in tribal wars, at others certainly inspired
their people to combat. But before we blame them
for the creation of a doctrine which appears to us
barbarous and inhuman, let us remember that even
within our own times it has been preached, amJ not
without effect.
The basic foundations of Abrcd, we are told, are
the predominance of opposition and Cythraul over
prosperity and amendment, necessary lawlessness
and death ensuing from the mastery of Cytllranl and
from the system o[ deliverance which is according to
t.he love and merc-y of God. H ere we find the stale
of A bred set forth as a dreadful necessity, a part of
a psychic evolution which must be borne. It is clear
that from this philosophy man is expected to realise
that life on the earth-plane can never be a happy
experience, that he must be resigned to it. This
might seem at the first glance similar to the Eastern
idea of bearing existence with resignation, but this is
rather belied by the preceding statement that surh a
condition may be shortened by strife and slaughter.
The three necessities of the state of Gwywr.,yd,
the spiritual plane, are the predominance of good
over evil, memory reaching from Amtwn, and lwnc<"
perfect judgemenr and understanding without the
possibility of doubting or differing, and lastly
superiority over death. This consists in power
derived from knowing the whole of its cause and the
means of escaping it, and hence everlasting life-. It
has often seemed strange to commentators on ancient
dogma that the idea o£ the survival of memory in the
last phase of psychic existence should be so greatly
stressed. One wonders precisely what the value of
such recollection mighr be, unless it is to rend<'r the
soul more perfect by providing it with the lessons of
188 The Myste ri e s of Britain
experience in full. I am inclined to think that it
signifies that there can be no real happiness without
perfect knowledge and experience, that happiness in
a higher state is actually relative to the suffering
endured in lower phases of existence. Again, the
spell, so to speak, by aid of which man escapes from
death, triumphs over it, consists in power derived
from knowing the whole of its cause. That is, the
secrets of death must be plumbed and accurately
understood before the soul can triumph over it.
This throws some light on the allegory of the descent
o( Hu, or his other form Arthur, into the depths of
Anmcm. Not only did he penetrate thither for the
pw·pose of seeking rhe cauldron of inspiration, the
source of life, which was naturally located in the
gloomy abyss whence life in its early forms was
thought to have sprung, but he also sought to gauge
the secrets and mysteries of death, the opposite of
life, and that this knowledge was part of the initiation
of the brotherhood of the Secret T radition we can
scarcely doubt.
We have little data to assure us that the belief
in such a secret was held by other ancient brother-
hoods. As regards the Osirian tradition, Osiris was
certainly Lord of the Dead, but that the priests of his
cult regarded it as essential to probe into the
mysteries of death l can discover no evidence.
The same holds good of the E leusinian mysteries
and others. The place of death, the Underworld ,
was to the hierophants of these cults also the place
of the beginning of life, at least of cereal life, to
which they likened that of mankind. At the same
time the i11itiates must pass through the place of
death to reach life. The embalmers of Egypt wen•
wont to imitate the hues and colours. of life in th1'
corpse by painting its face red and by giving it
Th e Hig h er Phil osop h y 189
artificial eyes. H owever, the early Osirian alchemy
appears to have excogitated a system of thought by
which out of dead metals and C'arths a c;peries of
psychic elixir was developed. In some relig-ions,
too, we observe the idea that life rna\· rmanate from
death. The idea of resurrection wa~ known to the
l ~gyptians anti is still upheld by the Christian
rdigion, and although this is by no means the same
thing as the conquest of death by the discovery of
its secrets, it is nevertheless an assertion that death
m n be conquered.
But we find in both the Egyptian and Christian
religions the powers of death definitely overcome by
Osiric; and Chric;t, and in at least one Central
American religion, that o£the Quiches of Guatemala,
a similrtr allegor)' exists. Death and Hell are ovC"r-
come by these champions, it is implied, either by
material or spiritual weapons. In the allegory of
Arthur's descent into Annmm we have a similar
instance of the Harrying of Hell. The heroes
descend into Am1wn and some even do not return.
Atmwn, in the allegory, was therefore conquered br
force of arms, material or spiritual, and this also, we
may take it, formed part of the theatric pantomime
of initiation through which the neophyte must pass
when he became a member of the Brotherhood of the
Secret Tradition.
On the whole, then, we cannot deny a veriuicallv
British character to the philosophy set forth in
Bnnldas. Although certa in of its principlcc;
appear to have much in common with the mystical
philosophies of the East, there is assuredly contained
in it a strong leaven of W estern thought and
idealism, which renders it worthy of the consideration
llf British mystics as enshrining much that is of
t•xtraorclinary value to the race from a psychological
190 Th e M yste ri es of Bri ta in
point of view, and which should not be lightly cast
aside.
\tVhy, incleed, should we not strive to study and
preserve the mysticism of our early ancestors rather
than seek in the records of the East Eor guidance in
things hidden and secret? Are the tenet.c:; set forth
in the records and chronicles of our own island less
lofty or less worthy of consideration, are they not
more in consonance with the tendency and genius of
British mentality than the mystic systems of the
Orient? Are we not carried away in this regard by
the hallucination of a specious Oriental glamour
heightened by spurious imagination and sham
romance? The attitude is on the same plane as that
which prefers Cominental musical talent to our own,
and which has resulted in the decay and almost the
death of British music, formerly a flourishing institu-
tion. Is there not something weakly, supine, and
unimaginative in the fashion which strains for a
distant enchantment and can discover none at its own
portals? \tVherefore has British mysticism been
permitted to languish for generations to the behoof
of an exotic tradition which is not superior to it and
is of no prior authority ?
Let the reproach be removed, let us address
ourselves to the serious consideration and rehabilita-
tion, the rescue and restoration of the noble Secret
Tradition of our fathers. I do not mean to infer
that we should entirely neglect other traditions.
That would be as foolish as to despise our own. But
I emphatically believe that it would be eminently for
our psychic advantage to restore and rebuild thl·
ruined edifice of British mysticism, as rendert-d
conformable to Christian belief by the bards, whn
were the conservators of the ancient Secrrt
Tradition. In its tenets, as purified by them, i·•
The Higher Phil osophy 191
little of Lhe barbarous which only too plainly reveals
itself in the systems of the East, and which has,
therefore, rendered them unacceptable to thousands
of British people as suspect of diabolism and the
horrors o£ the lower wltus which indubitably cling to
them. As set forth in Barddas there is nothing
in our native mysticism which the most orthodox
Christian could not accept. It is. in a word, the
native British mystical thought applied to the
Christian ideal. The scattered stones are to our
hands. Some, indeed, are lost, but search can
assuredly restore them. Let them be unearthed,
and the T empie of the British Secret Tradition be
re-edificated. These are days of restoration, when
men in every land, tired of the cosmopolitan wilh
its wearisome affectations, are inquiring into the
foundations and origins of those things which have
developed their own particular environment. " Far
fowls have fair feathers", says the old proverb,
illustrating a human infirmity which enlightened men
are beginning to realize only too well.
As a patriotic Scotsman and Briton, I would
appeal to English, Scottish and V.Jelsh mystics not
to let that die easily which must inevitably be to us
all of the utmost value. We Britons are a "peculiar
people,'' rapt and divided from our Continental
neighbours by tendencies of thought excepLionally
remote and individual. In that lies our greatness.
And so it was in the beginning. This sacred isle
constituted a laboratory of thought and mystery
recognized by the races of the Continent as unspe.-•k-
ably hallowed and inscrutable. Can we, if we admit
and encourage alien and by no means harmless
esoteric systems, do so without damage unspeakable
to the psychical integrity of our island ? We
assuredly cannot. The system to our hands is not
192 The My s t e r i e s o f Brit a in
only of British origin, but it is more susceptible o£
response to British mentality than any exotic system,
it is capable of such a degree of restoration as may
render it of much greater opportunity to British
mystics as a gateway to the universalities by reason
of a more native, more kindly and more familiar
aspect than any alien portal reveals.
It may be that in the higher existence there is
neither Greek nor Jew, Syrian nor Ethiopian, bond
nor free. But in this of A bred we are so much the
creatures of our immediate environment, that only
by a realization of and agreement with its properties
can we hope to accomplish anything, whether
material or spiritual. And surely a system which has
already sounded and comprehended these properties
is of all systems the most fitting and natural for U !\
to adopt as a groundwork of psychic advancement.
" The Secret Tradition of Britain!" Does not
the very name stir the heart and appeal to the
imagination of the true son of Albion with a thrill
more mysterious and romantic than any allusion to
the magics of Egypt or H ind ? I need no Thebes
or Benares, no Vedic H ymns, no Book of the D ead,
for I am heir to a lore as exalted , as sublime as these,
inherited [rom Druid sires, and in the main restored
by pious searching. And in this Tradition restored
1 believe the future germ of British Mysticism to
reside, that from its ash and cinder the phrenix o£
a marvellous rebirth shall arise on invincible wing :
Like that self-begotten bird
In the Arabian woods embost,
That no second knows, nor third,
And lay erewhile a holocaust,
From out her ashy womb now teemed,
Revives, rcfiourishes , then vigorous most
\Vhcn most unactive deemed,
And though her body die, her fame survives
A secular bird, ages of lives!
CHAPTER IX
THE WAY OF INITIATION
f ROM the evidence already placed bdore th~ reader
it is possible in some measure to recoustruct the rites
of in!tiation of the Secret Tradition. 1t is not
claimed that it is here competent to divulge them in
their entirety, as the gaps and lacunre in the evidence
are only too ob\'ious, but an outline at least can besup-
plied, and there is no doubt in the mind of the writer
that adequate research would succeed in the recovery
o( still further evidence, d1e lost links of the chain.
Ccesar tells us that the Druids were in the habit
oE making their initiates undergo a very long course
of preparation before they reached what may be
described as adeptship. He also states that they
were extremely jealous lest their rites and ceremonies
should be observed or overlooked by the vulgar
herd. Now this can in no sense apply to public
rites. It cannot but signify those more secret
ceremonies associated with magic or initiation.
That an arcane brotherhood, the Pheryllt, actually
existed we have already seen, and doubtless it was
to them that the business of initiatio11 was entrusted.
That this was associated with the Cauluron is
rmmi[cst not only from numerous \Velsh por rns, but
also from the allegory itself, which makes it plain
rhat the draugh~ of inspiration was the bst, nr one of
the last, steps in the ceremony of initiation.
Now we have the authority of a poem of T alicsin
entitled " The Chair of T aliesin", (or describing
certain of the apparatus and ceremonial associated
with initiation. As it ts important, I make no
t93

194 Th e Myste ries of Britain
apology for quoting it in full after the translation of
Davies:
I am he who animates the fire, to the honour of the god
Duvydd, in behalf of the assembly of associates qualified
to treat of mysteries-a bard with the knowledge of a
Sywcdydd, when he deliberately recjtcs the inspired song
of the \Vestern Cudd on a serene night amongst the stones.
As to loquacious, glittering bards, their encomium
attracts me not when moving in the course ; admiration
is their great object.
And I am a silent proficient who address the bards of
the land; it is mine to animate the hero; to persuade
the unadvised; to awaken the silent beholder-the bold
illuminator of kings!
I am no shallow artist, greeting the Bards of a house-
hold like a subtle parasite-the ocean has a due profundity I
The man of complete discipline has obtained the meed
of honour in every knightly celebration, when Dien is
propitiated with an offering of wheat, and the suavity
of bees, and incense and myrrh and aloes from beyond
the seas, and the golden pipes of Lieu, and cheerful
precious silvcr and the ruddy gem, and the berries, and
the foam of the ocean, and cresses of a purifying quality,
laved in the fountain, and a joint contribution of wort, the
founder of liquor, supplied by the assembly, with a raised
load, secluded from the moon, of placid, cheerful vervain.
\Vith priests of intelligence to officiate on behalf of
the moon, and the concourse of associated men under the
open breeze of the sky, with the maceration and sprinkling
and the portion after the sprinkling, and the boat of glass
in tl1e hand of the stranger, and the stout youth with
pitch, and the honoured Se~yrffyg, and medical plants
from an exorcised spot.
And Bards with Rowers and perfect convolutions, and
primroses and leaves of the Briw, with the points of the trees
of purposes, and solution of doubts, and frequent mutual
pledges; and with wine which flows to the brim, from
Rome to Rosedd, and deep standing water, a Rood which
has the gift of l)ovydd, on the tree of pure gold, which
becomes of a fructifying quality when that Brewer gives
it a boiling who presided over thecauldron of the five plants.
Hence the stream of Gwion and the reign of serenity
and honey and trefoil, and horns flowing with mead-

tP us as evidence of the former existence of an ancient
..,~tern of initiation. For what possible purpose.
lilt ked, could it have been otherwigc im·entC'd? ]L.,
dc·tails are tno closely associated with what we know
of Druidical practice and, indeed, of the rituals of
11ther and similar mysteries not to have had an actual
background in reality. Let us examine them a little
111ore closely. The first four paragraphs arc
obviously prefatory. The name Sywedydd is the
first hint we receive that we are dealing with some-
thing out of the common, something occult and
mysterious. It implies mystagogue, or revealer of
mysteries, and the word Cudd which follows it
signifies ' 'the Place of the Dark Repository''.
The paragraph which follows these relates to the
herbs and other materials which were seethed
together in the Cauldron of Inspiration. T he "g.9ld
pipes of Lieu" obviously allude to some yellow
A
ower, and the "cheerful precious silver" seems to
mean the Auxwort, which in \i\fales is known as
aria11t Gwion, or "Gwion's silver" , which in itself
proves that it was associated in Cambrian lore with
the mystical cauldron. The "ruddy gem" is
perhaps the hedge-berry, which was also known as
eiriu G·wion, the llorues of Gwion. The cresscg
allude lO the Fabaria, called berwr Taliessin, or
"Taliessin's Cresses", and on vervain the Druids sc·l
particular store, casting lots by its use and employing
it in divination. It was usually gathered at the rise
of the Dog-star " \Vithout being looked upon either
by the sun or moon". In gathering it the earth
was propitiated by a libation of honey and it was dug
up with the left hand.
The Boat of Glass was a c:resccnt shaped like a
half-moon and in all probability was the vessel from
which the draught of inspiration was quaffed .
196 The Myste ries o f Britain
Primroses ranked highly among the mystical
apparatus and the b1·i·w was probably also vervain,
which was known by the name of briw',. March.
The poem states that the same rite of Jibation
prevailed from Rome to Rosedd. This seems to
point to a date for its composition when the Britons
were acquainted with the Romans, but while Rome
itself was yet pagan. The ''deep water'' seems to
signify the bath for the immersion of the neophyte,
and the gift of Duvydd was the Selago or hedge-
hyssop, which in modern \N'elsh is known as gras
Duw. Pliny says of this plant: "Similar to savin
is the plant called Selago. It is gathered without
using iron and by passing the right hand through the
left sleeve of the tunic, as though in the act of
committing a theft. The clothing must be white,
the feet washed and bare and an offering of wine and
bread made before the gathering. The Druids of
Gaul say that the plant should be carried as a charm
against every kind of evil and that the smoke of it
is good for diseases of the eye.''
These, then, were the mysticaJ plants, the
ingredients of the Cauldron of Keridwen which
produced the stream of Gwion, to which is ascribed
the beginning of genius, the power of inspiration and
the reign of serenity.
Now we find that these rites, far from falling into
desuetude, were actually employed so late as thf'
twelfth century, when Hywel, Prince of North
Wales, was initiated into the lesser mysteries of
Keridwen in I r71, and that he longed for admittanct·
to the greater mysteries conducted by Gwyddnaw
and his son. In a song supposed to be sung by
H ywel he addresses Keridwen as the moon, lofl y
and fair, slow and delicate in her descendjng course·,
and requests her to attend his worship in the mystical

grove. '' I love the place of lhe illustrious lady
near the pleasant shore," sings H ywel, " for the
severe discipline which I experienced in the hall o(
the mysterious god, I have obtained her promise-a
treasure of high privilege. 1 shall long
for the proud-wrought place of the Gyvylchi till I
have gained admittance. Renowned and enterpris-
ing is the man who enters there." " If we may
judge from these strains of H ywel," says Davies,
'' and £rom many similar passages in the works of his
contemporaries, the Cambrian bards were as zeal-
ously devoted to the worship of Keridwen
in the twelfth century as they had been in the sixth,
or in any earlier age of heathen superstition."
Now "the proud-wrought enclosure in the
Gwvylchi, in the desert of Arvon in Eryri,'' or
Snowdon, and near the shore, was the Caer or
sanctuary of Keridwen and her daughter Llywy.
'' The topography of this temple is so minutely
pointed out," says Davies , " that the spot cannot
be mistaken. Dwy-Gyvylchi is still known
as the name of a parish in the very spot whc-re the
Cambrian prince fixed his Caer W en Glaer, or
sanctuary of the illustrious lady' in the dcs<'rts or
Arvon in Eryri and towarns the sea : and h<·r<' the
remains of the Caer are still to be found."
Camden's annotator, Gibson, has described a stron~
fortress "seated on the top of one of the highest
mountains which lies towards the sea", and gives the
following account of this ancient temple : ' ' J\boul a
mile from this fortification stands the most remarkablr
monument in all Snowdon, called Y Mci11c1L Hirimz
upon the Plain Mountain within the parish or D wy-
Gyvycheu, above Gwddw Glas . It is a circular
entrenchment about twenty-six yards diameter; on
the outside whereof are certain rude stone pillars, of
198 T h e 1
\1y s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
which about twelve are now standing, some two
~ ards and others five (oot high : and these are again
encompassed with a stone wall. It stands upon the
Plain l\ lountain as soon as we come to the height,
having much even ground about it ; and not far from
it there are three other large stones pitched on end
in a triangular form.''
Gibson, the annotator of Camden, also informs
us that at the distance of about three furlongs from
this monument are several huge heaps or cairns
and also several cells constructed of huge stones fixed
in the ground. each cell being covered with one or
two stones of great size.
Bearing in mind the words of H ywel relative to the
locality, there can surely he no question that these
stones are the remains of the open-air temple of
Keridwen, and that the cells alluded to by Gibson
were the secret places in which the neophyte was
prepared for initiation. I do not propose to enter
into the welter of controversy concerning the question
as to whether the Druids actually employed the stone-
circles of this island for purposes of worship or not.
T hat they did not raise many of them is obvious,
but it is odd that those who have argued so fiercely
against their use by the Druids should not have been
able to discover the many evidences in Literature
where they a.re spoken of as using them for that
purpose and of which I shall give some account
towards the end of this chapter.
T he reader will recollect that the Pheryllt, or
priests of the Pharaon, had a city or temple on
Snowdon known as Dinas Emrys, which has already
been described. ow it seems to me not at all
unlikely that this T emple of Keridwen, only about a
mile away from the site of Dinas Emrys, must haw
been under the auspices of the Pheryllt, and this
Th e \V a y o f In it ia t io n 199
leads to the supposition that they were flourishing in
H ywel's time-Lhat is in the twelfth century.
An ancient poem in the Welsh A1·chaiology
supplies us with an old formula in obscure language
which appears to have been employed on occasions
of initiation as an introduction £or approaching the
gate of the sanctuary. Arthur and Kai are repre-
sented as coming to the portal, which is guarded by
a hierophant, and the following dialogue takes place :
Arthur : W hat man is he that guards the gate?
Hierophaot: The severe hoary one with the wide domin-
ion-who is the man that demands it?
Arthur: Arthur and the Blessed Kai.
Hierophant: What good attends thee, thou blessed one,
thou best man in the world? fnto my house thou canst
not enter unless thou wilt preserve.
Kai : I will preserve it and that thou shalt behold ;
though the birds of wrath should go forth and the three
attendant ministers should fall asleep, namely the son of
the Creator Mabon, the son of Mydron, attendant upon
the wonderful supreme Ruler, and Gwyn, the Lord of
those who descend from above.
Hierophant: Severe have my servants heen in preserv-
ing their institutes. l\lannwyddan, the son of Llyr, was
grave in his counsel, Manawyd truly brought a pt•rforatctl
shield from Trcvryd, and ~labon, the son of Lig-htning,
stained the straw with clotted gore: and 1\nwns the
winged and Llwch Llawinawg (the ruJer of thl· lakes)
were firm guardians of the encircled mount. T h<'ir Lorcl
preserved them nncl f rendered them compl<'t<'. Kni ! I
solemnly announce though all three should ht• slain, whl'n
the privilege of the grove is violated, dang-er :;hall be
found.
T he rest of this obscure dialogue drsrribes the
adventures of Arthur and Kai after their initiation,
but it is clear that in the part of it I have quoted
the neophyte engaged before the hcirophant to
preserve the laws of the sanctuary, even though
assaulted by enemies or deserted by friends. T he
hierophant in his turn denounces the fate of those
who violate the sacred engagement. It is plain. too,
200 T he My s terie s o f B rit a i n
from the text that the hierophant wac; attended by
three assistant mini!'ters, each nf whom !'eems to
have impersonated a god, and in this the usage
seems to have been the same as th<lt prevailing in
the Eleusinian mysteries, in which four priests
officiated, the hierophant, whn represf'ntcd the
Creator, the torch-bearer, who personatC'd the sun,
the herald, who took the part nr t\lercury, and the
minister of the almr, who represented the moon.
We must now return for enlightenment to the myth
of Keridwen and her Cauldron. This Cauldron
cannot but have been one and the same with the
Cauldron of [nspiration alluded to in the myths of
Aunwn, to which 1\rthur or H u penetrated. lt has
precisely the same character and is described in the
same manner, and when we learn that Keridwen was
a goddess of the Undcrworld , the identity of the
vessel seems complete. She is also styiNI Ogyrven
Amhad, " the goddess of various seeds", a statement
which equal<'" her with Ceres, and indeed she
appears to have been the British Ceres.
We will recollect that when Gwion unwittingly
tasted the virtue of her Cauldron o£ Jnspiration she
pursued him , that he transformed himself into a hare ,
when she became a greyhound, turned him, and
chased him toward a river. H e leapt into the stream
and became a fish, but as she pursuer! him as an
orter, he took the form of a bird. Transforming
herself into the guise of a sparrowhawk, she was
gaining upon him, when he perceived a heap of wheat
upon a floor, dropped into the midst of it, and
assumed the form of a single grain. Keridwen then
changed herself into Lhe shape of a black, high-crested
hen, descended into the wheat, scratched him out,
and swallower! him , and , as the history relates, lw
was born of her in due time as the bf'autiful hal,c
Th e W ay o f Initi a ti o n 201
Taliesin, who was found in the fishing weir of E lphin.
Now tlte whole myth certainly lw.ars allusions to
the rite of initiaLion. Keridwen first transforms
herself into a female dog. Virgil, in the sixth book
of his JF.11eid, desrribing all that it was lawful to
reveal o[ the Eleusinian mysteries, says that one of
the first things observed by his hero as the prieste.
<;s
conducted him toward the mystic river were a numuer
o[ female dogs, and Pletho in his notes upon the
Magical Oracles of Zoroaster, remarks that it is the
custom in the celebration of the mysteries to exhibit
to the initiated certain phantoms in the figures n(
dogs. T he dog was, indeed, the guardian of the
Underworld, and it seems probable that, as the
initiate was supposed to enter this gloomy region
when undergoing his ordeal, the presence of dogs
may have entered symbolically into the ceremony.
Indeed, Oiodorus, dealing with the mysteries of Isis,
mentions that the whole solemnity was prereded Ly
the presence of dogs, and he even terms the priests
of mysteries "dogs", although he believes that the
Greeks mistook the H ebrew word cohen, a priest,
for their own word ktme, dog. However, the dog of
G_wyn ap Nudd, the British Plato, is named Dor-
marth, "the gate of sorrow", so it would seem that
the animals represented in the British mysteries
somewhat resembled the classical Cerberus, and that
they had a similar significance--that they were ,
indeed, of the same rharacter as the Prosc·rf>inc
Limen which Apuleius approached in the course of
his initiation.
Then we find that the aspirant was converted into
a hare, a sacred animal among the Britons, as we
learn from Crr·sar, but perhaps here symbolizing the
great timidity of Lhe novice. This hare is lurnf'd and
driven toward a river. The first ceremony in lhe
202 T he M y s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
Greek mysteries was that of purification, which was
celebrated upon the banks of rivers. The Athenians,
for example, performed this ceremony at Agra on
the Ilissus, a river of Attica, whose banks were
called "the mystical", and whose stream itself was
named "the divine".
According to the myth, the aspirant now plunges
into the stream, and the otter here seems to
symbolize the priest who attended to hie; lustrations.
His form then changes into that of a bird, probably
the drY'w, which means both a wren and a Druid,
and, indeed, elsewhere Taliesin informs us that he
had once taken that form. His adversary becomes
a hawk, reminiscent of Egyptian mythology. At
last he takes the shape of a grain of pure wheat,
mixing with an assemblage of the same species, and
chus assumes a form eminently sacred to Ceres or
Keridwen, who receives him into her bosom, whence
he is re-born. The meaning of this statement
probably resides in the fact that the initiate remnined
for a season in one of the mysterious cells or caves
of the Druidic cult, where he was subjected to a rigid
course u£ discipline, and where he studied the rites
and imbibed the secret doctrines of Keridwen, lastly
emerging "re-born" into the outer world.
But this description probably applies to the lesser
or initial mysteries only. The greater were still to
follow. After the initiate had completed his course
of discipline in the cell and had been born again of
Keriuwen, the goddess enclosed him in a coracle
covered with slcin and cast him into the sea. Now if
we cc_>mpare this procedure with that known to haw·
been followed in the Greek mysteries, we discover
a close resemblance between the two. After pasc;ing
through the lesser mysteries the herald summoned t lw
initiart•c; ro the sea-shore. The name of the day nn
The \Va y o f I n i t i a t i o n 203
which this LOok place was entitled "Novitiates to the
Sea" 1
after the summons of the herald. The
aspirams on this occasion embarked upon the sea in
l'ertain vessels, and it was in these mysteries, we are
told, that the whole truth was to be revealed. Now
we will recall that in the myth of Taliesin he was,
while yet a babe, albeit a learned one, launched by
Keridwen in a coracle which took him to the weir of
Gwyddno, where he was discovered by Gwyddno's
son Elphin . lie prophesied the future renown of
Elphin and his own as well. Elphin bore the babe
co the castle, where Gwyddno demanded of Taliesin
whether he was a human being or a spirit. The
infant Taliesin replied in a mystical song, in which
lw described himself as a general primary bard who
had existed in all ages and was in some measure'
identified with the sun. ''Thrice have I been born,''
sang T aliesin, the Radiant Fronted one, " 1 know
how to meditate. It is pitiful that men will not come
to seek all the sciences of the world which arc
treasured in my bosom, for l know all that has been
and all that will be hereafter.''
Now Davies (whom I have closely followed as
regards these latter passages, and who was, indeed,
very much more competent to speak on these mattl:'rs
than some of the modern mythologists who have
rather cruelly sneered at him, owing to his ratlwr
tiresome theory that the whole of British myth is to
be referred to what he calls "Arkite" theology),
believed that Gwyddno and his son were the
husband and son of Keridwen. This seems not
improbable, when we remember thar Gwyddno was
the lord and Keridwen lady of Anwwn. Gwyddno's
surname was Garanhir, or the "long1 or high
crane", or "Stalking Person", to which allusion has
already been made in the chapter on the Grail and
204 T h e My s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
elsewhere, where it was stated that the bull god o(
the Continemal Kelts was styled Trigaranos, because
he carried three cranes. Elsewhere Taliesin alludes
to Elphin as " The sovereign of those who carry ears
of corn", and later in his life he was to liberate him
from a strong-stoned tower in which he had been
imprisoned by Maelgwn. Elphin has certainly some
solar significance.
One of the poems atlributed to Gwyddno appears
to have an application to the enclosing of the aspir~nt
in the coracle. The novice is about to be plunged
into the waves and he sings : " Though I love the
sea-beach I dread tl1e open sea. A billow may come
undulating over the stone." To this the hierophant
replies: " To the brave, to the magnanimous, to the
amiable, to the generous who boldly embarks, the
ascending stones of U1e Bards will prove the harbour
of life. It has asserted the praise of Heilyn, the
mysterious impeller of the sky. Until the doom shall
its symbol be continued." Still the novice is not
re~ssured. " Though 1 love the strand," he cries,
" I dread the wave. Great has been its violence-
dismal the overwhelming stroke. Even to him whn
survives, it will be the subject of lamentation."
Once more endeavouring to reassure him, Gwyddnn
says : " lL is a pleasant act, to wash in the bosom
of the fair water. Though it fill the receptacle it
will not disturb the heart. My associated train
regard not its overwhelming. As for him who
repented of his enterprise, the lofty wave has hurried
the babbler far away to his death ; but the brave, tlw
magnanimous, will find his compensation in arrivin~
safe' :1l th<' stones. The conduct of the water will
declare thy merit.' '
But to the timiJ or 1ej<..cted candidate he addres~.,·d
himself thus : " Thy coming without external purity
The W ay o f I n i t i a t i o n 205
is a pledge that I will not receive thee. Take out the
gloomy one ! From my territory h:wf' T alienated
the rueful s li'Cd. r\'fy revenge up()II tlw ~.l1ua l of
earth-worms is their hopeless longing fnr thv pleasant
place. Out of the receptacle which is th ~r aversion
did I obtain the rainbow."
Davies believed this ceremony to have t:tken
place in Cardigan Bay, at the mouth of the Yst\vyth.
The ceremony was intended to test the constancy
ttnd purity of mind of the neophyte. " The nlcl
bards,
11
he says, '' speak in magnificent terms of the
benefits which were derived from these mysterious
rites. They were viewed as most important to the
happiness of human life. They imparted sacred
science in its greatest purity and perfection ; and he
who had completed his probation was callcd
Ded·wydd, 'one who has recovered intelligenre' I or
rather has been brought back into the Presence. l t
is nearly equivalent to the Greek term Epvf>lcs,
which describes a person who had been initiated into
the greater mysteries." By the course of the tide
it was to be discovered whether or no the initiate was
worthy to survive, as in the case of Talicsin himselr.
T aliesin, in a poem recited immediately after he
had gone through the concluding ceremony, dcsrrihes
himself as "thrice-born", that is, once of his natural
mother, once of Keridwen, and lastly of the mys1ic
coracle. As a consequence of this regeneration h~
tells us that he " knew how to think rightly nf God",
and that all the sacred science of the wflrld w:1s
treasured in his bosom.
In a poem immediately following this, T alicsin
sings : •• I was first modelled into the form of a pure
man in the hall of Keridwen, who subjected me to
penance. Though small within my chest and modest
in my deportment, I was great. A sanctuary carried
206 Th e Mys te r i e s o r Br i ta in
me above the surface of the earth. Whilst T was
enclosed within its ribs the sweet Awen rendered me
compiPte, and my law, without audible languag-e, was
imparted to me hy the old giantess, darkly smiling
in her wrath." In the concluding verse he says : "I
fled in the form of a fatr grain of pure wheat. Upon
the edge of a covering cloth she caught me in her
fangs. In appearance she was as large as a proud
mare, which she also resembled-then was she
swelling out like a ship upon the waters. Into a
dark receptacle she cast me. She carried me back
into the sea of Dylan. It was an auspicious omen
to me when she happily suffocated me. God the
Lord freely set me at large.' ' This obviously
applied to a course of penance, discipline and mystical
instruction undergone by the initiate, and must have
consisted in scenic or symbolical representation, as
language does not seem to have been employed.
It appears to have taken place in the T emple of
Keridwen, and the goddess seems to have taken
various shapes, just as did Diana in the mysterie.c;
described by the author of the 0 rphic A rKmttmtics.
She transformed herself into the shapes of a dog, a
horse, and a lion, according to the particular
knowledge she desired to impart.
One of the most remarkable poems connected with
Keridwen is that in which her priest deals with certain
passages in her history . H e tells us that in the dead
of night and at the dawn, the light.<; of the initiatf's
have been shining, ant1 that as to A vaggdu., her son,
the correcting god has formed him anew fnr
happiness. In the contention of the mysteries,
indeed, his wisdom has exceeded her own, and he·
has become the most accomplished of beings. 1Ii·~
bride is a woman composed of Rowers, whom, hy hi•.
exquisite art, Gwyclion created.
T h e W ay of In it i atio n 207
'' \Vhen the merit of the presidencies shall be
:1djudged," says Keridwen through the mouth o( her
priest, " mine will be found the superior amongst
them-my chair, my cauldron and my laws and my
pervading eloguence meet for the presidency.''
" This poem," says Davies, " was evidenlly
intended to be sung or recited by a priest or priestess
who personated Keridwen. ''
Davies concludes his rather rambling criticisms of
these ceremonial poems by certain remarks which,
whatever one may think of his general method, have
a good deal of cogency behind them. H e says it is
scarcely to be wondered at that the ancient Britons
should have pertinaciously adhered to the rites of the
British Ceres as lately as the sixth century, especially
during the period between the dominion of the
Romans and the coming of the Saxons. '' There
seems," he says, " to have been several parts of
Wales into which Christianity as yet had scarcely
penetrated ; or where, at least, it had not prevailed.
H ence Brychan is commended 'for bringing up his
children and grand-children in learning, so as to be
able to show the faith in Christ to the Cymry where
rhey were without the faith'.'' H e goes on to say
that the \iVelsh princes, to the latest period of their
government, not only tolerated but patronized the
old rites, and that the mysteries of Keridwen were
celebrated in Wales as late as the middle o[ the
twelfth century. They influenced the writings o[ the
bards, and the princes were induced by national
prejudice to regard these as innocent and to fancy
that they might be good Christians enough without
wholly relinquishing their heathenish superstitions.
The ministers of Christianity thought otherwise, and
sometimes refused Christian burial to these Gentile
priests, and there are numerous instances of the bards
208 The Mys t e ries o f Brita in
themselves promising a kind recantation some time
before their death.
We must now turn to the question as to whether
the stone circles commonly attributed to the Druids
were ever employed by them for religious or mystical
purposes. That they were first raised by the Druids,
as Druids, is, as we have seen, out of the question.
The cult which was responsible for them may have
Lcen proto-Druidic, that is, it may have held the
early germs of Druidism, although there is no
evidence to countenance such a theory. But that
they were actually employed by the later Druids is
undoubted, whatever recent arguments may have
been brought against this belief.
In the first place, we have early Christian evidence
on the matter. Pope Gregory in his famous Bull,
and in his instructions to the Abbot Melitus when
he dispatched him to Britain, advised him not to
destroy the British temples or fanes, but only the
idols they contained, as they might be suitable to the
worship of the true Cod. William Thorn, the monk
of. Canterbury, spPaks of a fane towards the east of
that city where King Ethelbert was accustomed to
celebrate heathen worship.' This fane, was are told
by another chronicler, was built "in the British
manner''. T he twentieth Canon of the Council of
Nantes, promulgated about A.D. 658, provides that
stones in ruinous places and woods raised to the·
worship of demons shall be destroyed, and a simihu
fulmination against standing stones is given in Lh('
Libe1· Pre11itentialis of Archbishop Theodore, nf
Canterbury (A.D. 602-690). " If any may haw
vowed or paid a vow at trees, or at fountains, or at
stones, whether at the balusters, or anywhere clsC',
• According to accounts received while this volume was in 1111
Press, this '' f<tne" hns t•nly recently l•ccn unc~1rthcd.
T h e W ay o f In i t ia t io n 209
t·xcepting in the Church of God''. The word
"balusters " here means "encompassing rails" or
-;LOne balustrade. In Ireland, St. Patrick is said to
have incised the name of Christ on three lo(ty stones
on the Plain o( Magh Slecht which were associated
with heathenish rites.
'vVe know that St. Samson, Bi5hop of Dol in
Brittany, when travelling in Britain actually surpri!-ctl
c-ertain " B~n·hanalians" while worshipping an idol
on the top ol a mound within a stone circle. He
endeaYoured to dissuade them from the practice, and
they were dispULing him, when a certain youth
passing in a chariot was thrown therefrom and broke
his neck. This was taken as a sign that God was
displeased with the idolatry, and the pagan congrega-
tion broke up.
There is plenty of evidence that in Scotland courts
were held at stone circles as late as the fourteenth
c-entury. One was convened in 1349 by W illiam,
Earl of Ross, J usticiary of Scotland, at the standing
~tones of Rayne in Garioch, and another by
Alexander Stewart, Lord of Badenoch, the King's
Lieutenant, in the year 1380 at the standing stones •·f
Easter Kyngucy in Badenoch. This is eloquent of
very ancient custom.
Davies provides a lengthy and in some ways a
useful disqui5ition on the question of Druidic circles.
He believes that the circle named Caer Sidi w<ts th<'
T emple of Keridwen, and that its prototype wa$ the
locality of Cacr Sidi in Am1w 1L. Of this Chair
Taliesin was the pre~ident. " Is not my c-h:-tir
protected by the Cauldron of Keridwen ?" sings
T aliesin, " therefore let my tongue be free in the
sanctuary of the praise of the goddess''. Davies
believed that this sanctuary was modelled on the
great circle of the Zodiac. " I have presided iu a
0
210 T he M y s t e rie s o £ Br i t a i n
toilsome Chair over the circle of Sidin whilst that is
continually revolving between three elements. Is it
not a wonder to the world that men are not
enlightened?" These words of T aliesin, Davie.'>
translates as signifying that the sun is the visiblt·
president. Taliesin, or " Radiant Front", was hi::;
earthly representative in that sanctuary, which
typified the abode of the god.
Now Davies further believed that these ' 'Caer
Sidis" were none other than the stone circles. He
drags the Ark into his elucidations, but if we discount
this, we arrive at some not invaluable conclusions,
for, despite his notions regarding ''Arkite
philosophy", Davies was logical enough.
H e shows, for example, that when the mystical
Bards treat of history and the rites of Keridwen, thal
they almost invariably allude to the completion of the
year and the return of a particular day. He thought
that the stones in the circles represented the various
constellations, with the sun and the moon in the
centre. Now Caer Sidi, as he has said, means th«·
Circle of Revolution, and he notes that at least one
Druidic grove, the Cylch Balch Nevwy, was known
as the "magnificent celestial circle". H e also
proves that Aneurin, Taliesin and 1\llerlin in their
mystical poems mention the particular stones which
composed certain circles.
Then he reverts to the poem of Prince H Y'vel in
the Desert of Arvon in Snowdon, where stood the
sanctuary of Keridwen, visited by the prince as lately
as the twelfth century. T his '"as composed of a
circle of twelve stones, and Like other circles found
in Britain, was, he believed, "constructed upon
astronomical principles. In short, it represented
either the Zodiac itself, or certain cycles and com-
putations deduced from the study of astronomy.
\ '\ l'"1 ·1

T he Way o f In it iat io n 211
Hence the frequent repetition of twelve, nineteen,
thirty, or sixty stones which has been marked in the
circles of these monuments.'' He indicatec:; that the
number twelve is twice repeated in the circle at
Avebury, in the circle of Classernish, in the
western islands of Scotland, and in cert.ain Cornish
monuments.
Lastly, after a long dissertation on Stonehenge,
which has been superseded by recent research , he
states that the personage or prince known as Seithin
Saidi is called ''the guardian of the gate of Godo''
or "the uncovered sanctuary", which he believes
alludes to the typical stone circle.
Now when one recalls the philosophy set forth in
Barddas, with its cosmography of the universe
described in circles, it does not seem at all improbable
that the stone circles may have had some bearing
upon it. it seems likely that Druidism in these
islands mingled with a much older religion, whjrh had
as its basis the circular cosmography above alluded
to. On the other hand, it may have adapted the
stone circles to this cosmography, likening the out<'r
circle to Abred and the inner to Gwy11.vyd. I
hasten to say that I do not dogmatize on the suhj<'c
·t,
for where all is so vague it would, indeed, be rash
to do so. l'vloreover, it would be necessary to prove
that a similar course was adopted in Gaul and else-
where. We know that other cults in other countri<'s
employed the ancient stone circles built by thC'ir
predecessors. Thus it was only in the age of
Zoroaster, some five hundred years before our era,
that _
the Persians adopted covered temples, having
formerly worshipped in open-air circuJar structures,
and even the Greeks themselves, according to
Pausanius, are not free from the suspicion of having
done so in the early days of the Hellenic religion.
212 T he My s t e r i e s o r Br i t a i n
We know that the Druids worshipped in circular
groves. \Vhat, then, is more likely that, finding
stone groves ready erected and to their hand, they
employed these for ~ worship which had probably
much in common with the cult which had originally
been practised within them? At that I leave the
question. A great deal more requires to be known
concerning the cult of those who raised these circles
before we can speak more definitely upon it. But
Mr. Kendrick has given it as his opinion that
although the Uruids certainly did not build Stone-
henge, they employed it as a temple, and on the
whole f also conclude that this was actually the case.
One of the most pregnant statements on the use
to which certain stone monuments were put is that
of Mr. Bernard H. Springett on Traces of Mithraism
and Early Maso11ic Rese'l'nblances i11 the Stone
Remains of South Brittany, a copy of which he was
kind enough to send me in 1924. The remarks in
it might with equal reason apply to stone remains in
Brita~n. Many of the stone monuments in Brittany
struck 1\•
(r. Springett when he visited rhem as having
been erected for something beyond the usual reason
assigned, that of sun worship, and so forth . In
inspecting the dolmens, by which name the Bretons
call those stones covered by a large slab, he noted
that they were frequently found in the centre of
a tumulus, whereas certain stone chambers or cells
were invariably underground. In describing the~w
underground chambers, he says :
You descend a varying number of steps to the entranct•
of a passage, the steps being so arranged, with a curvt•
or an angle in them, that it is impossible from the first
step to look along the passage. This is roughly lin,·cl
with upright slabs like the chambers themselves, witII
appearances of having originally had the interstices lilk·cl
with chips of stone, or merely earth, perhaps. Thi"
T h e Vv a y o [ I ni t iat io n 213
central passage . . . leads direct to the lnrgest
chamber of a series of three, two others on the rig ht uf
the passage having entrances from it, but no intercom-
munication. On the left of the central pa:;~ag-c i~ a lon~.
somewhat narrower passage running right :tlong-~irlc• it,
almost to the end chamber, so tl1at anyom· 'unhl pa-.:.
direct into this end chamber without travcr~ing, Cl-.C'l'Jll
at each end, the main central passage.
i\lr. Springett asked a T\1asonic friend who
accompanied him if the plan of these chamber~ had
sugge.c;ted anything to him, and he replied that they
reminded him of the rooms used by Masons in tlw
Rose Croix Degree. " Then," writes 1\'1 r.
Springett, " we pictured together the wltnlc
ceremony, crude enough, no doubt, most prnh:-~hly
terrifically :\we-inspiring to the ancient candidates,
conducted Gy a Deacon down the steps, along the
central passage, fi rst into one side chamber , to he
shown some terrible and fearsome object. perhaps ;
then into the second chamber ; finally into the larg(' r
chamber at the end, no doubt for an Obligation, and
then admission. Meanwhile, officiating priests, on
the other side of the left hand wall of the ce111 ral
passage, were probably producing 'stage ciTcns'."
l\Jr. Springelt believes that the cult which mnde
use of these underground initiation chambPrs was
that oE I\[ithraism. There are, he says, two
legendary periuds for the erection of these sLOncs in
Brittany. O ne tradition asserts that they wNc
erected by D ruids, who C.C'lme Erom 13ritain for this
express purpn!'e and imitated the structttrf's used hy
them [or religious ceremonies in their own country.
The other is 1hat they were erected by a pcoplr whn
c:•111e fmm the East.

evidence of the existence of Mithraisw i11 Brittany
214 T he Mysteries o f Bri tai n
the legend of St. Cornely, the patron saint of Carnac,
who is always represented as accompanied by two
bulls-the symbolic Least of l\1ithraism ; but this
animal, as we have seen, was also symbolic of
Druidism. H e thinks that the smaller underground
chambers were used for outer degrees, while the
interiors of the tumuli were employed for the more
arcane rites of higher degrees. lVlany of these latter
were not employed for sepulchral purposes, and the
bones o( burnt cattle were discovered within them.
Moreover, on the walls of these chambers are rude
carvings o[ serpents and ears of corn, both accom-
paniments of Druidism as well as of ~Iithraism. On
an ancient covering stone of a tomb reclining against
the south wall of Plouharnel Church l\1r. Springett
observed a carving which seemed to him to represent
an initiate before an altar which supports a volume
and a square. Behind the altar stands the Master's
Light, which , like the chalice behind the candidate,
springs from a base supporting cones of increasing-
size, symbolizing the three stages to be passed
through before reachjng the vault below, from which
the cope-stone is removed. Beneath are the skull
and cross-bones, the level and twenty-four inch
gauge. Mr. Springett takes care to mention that
certain stones in Britain gave him much the same
impression as these Breton monuments, the cells
associated with which seem to me to be similar to, if
not identical in form with, those alluded to by
Camden's annotator as occurring at the Circle of
Keridwen in Arvon. In all probability they were
the cells in which the lesser mysteries were revealed
to the initiates, a conclusion which it will be seen
Ir. Springett shares with Davies and other writers
on the subject.
CHAPTER X
THE WRTTINGS OF "MORTEN"
T oWARDS the end of last century Druidism was
actually revived in Wales by an organization known
as "The Druids of Pontypridd", which cbirncd a
fair number o£ adherents in Wales, but a much
greater following in America. Myfyr Morganwg,
the Arch-Druid, publicly proclaimed the creed of his
forefathers after thirty years' preaching of Christian-
ity, and James Bonwick in his Irish. Dmids states
that he was an absolute believer in the tenets he
taught. H e recognized his Druidic principles in the
Jewish, Hindu, and Buddhist religions as well as in
classical mythology. He was followed by Owen
Morgan, better known as "Marien", whose version
of vVelsh Druidism can be studied in T1te Lif!hl of
Br-itannia, published in 1894. H e believed Druidism
to be prior in antiquity to any of the world's
religions. His work and that which followed it, Tilt•
Royal ·wi11ged Son of Stonehe11ge a11d A vebro·y. arc
certainly extraordinary storehouses of Druidi1· lore,
but the facts they contain are so inextricably ming-lf'd
with classical and Eastern mysticism that it is
frequently difficult to disentangle them. Morcovrr,
the sources from which Morgan drew his Druidic
material are only occasionally indicaterl throughout
the volumes, and although the origins of some o[
them are obvious, we are left absolutely in the dark as
to the source of others. T his notwithst."lncling, these
works are of primary importance in such a quest as
2 t 5
216 T he l\1 y s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
ours, because nf the great anrl varied acquaintance
they reveal willt thl! faith aud mythology unJ erlying
the British Secret TraJition, and an endeavour will
be made in these pages to summarize the system of
which they treat.
T o the Creator the Druids gave the name Celi
(Concealing), and to his consort the name of Ced
(Aid) or Keridwen. T hey beli~ved that Lhe firma-
ment was one vast wheel, in which wheel, seated
in a chair, the sun made his daily round. Celi and
Keridwen are incomprehensible spirits, but are the
originators of crude matter, which came in an
embryonic condition from across the ocean, from the
source of all elements. This essence is feminine and
passive in its nature, and was brought every spring
over the seas in a sacred boat shaped like the crescent
moon and propelled by Keridwen, who applied
intense heat beneath it, so that it also became a
cauldron. Its work done, it returned once more to
its source for a fresh cargo.
T he active warmth of the male principle, Celi, thf"
Druids personified under the name Gwion Bach , the
Keltic Bacchus, and the wine of which he is god is
simply the liquid employed in their mysteries to
symbolize the fertilized sap of fruit. This principlt>
was introduced into the cauldron as the three drops
mentioned in the allegory concerning it. T he Druids
believed that the sun and the earth had emanated
from two separate eggs in the Boat of Keridwen,
but the sun was believed to be a later product thnn
the earth. H e was known as Taliesin, but gre<
lt
confusion has been caused by the fact that various
names were given to the sun at different stages of
his annual progress, such as Hu Gadarn, Arthur,
and Taliesin. Formerly the Druids probably
symbolized the sun as a buJI and the earth as a cow,
T he \Vr it i ug s of "Mo r i e n '' 217
hut in his later type he sePms mystically tn have
lwcn kmnvn as T~l iesin nr thf' H igh I k sus. 1\s
Arthur, he was the cultivator of the garden-earth.
All titles of the sun, except fl u Gacbrn, are
comprehended in a T riad known as Plennydd,
/\lawn, and Gwron. The earth, for its part, was
known as the threr queens of Arthur , spring,
summer, and winter. The negative nr evil prillciplc·s
were three males Avagddu, Cythraul, and J\trais,
which signified Darkness, Pulverizer, and SoddcnC'r,
anJ three female principles, Annhras, Malen, and
i\fallt, or Graceless, Grinder , and Soddener.
In the system of Nature the Druids regarded the :-p:lt'c·
traversed by the sun from the first day of the solar 11nv
year (December 22nd) to the equinoxial line, or the wrnal
equinox (March 2rst) as the kingdom of l.od's l'.ystt·m of
lives, occupied also, the Druidic philosophrrs thoug ht, hy
evil influences until chased away by the m:ltThing- up .,f
the sun's Divinity. Man, they believed, occupies dttring-
the present life the middle line of that system {the •·qui-
noxial line of Lhe moral world). l-Ie is entrush'tl with
free-will, a nd is :1 free agent; the span· front
the equinoxial line of the moral system d murt':l'rJrth ru
where the old sun disappears on D ecember 2oth (2;:;tll) is,
in the moral world, occupied by the "lives " of the animal
kingdom in their tribes or divers species, in tilt• mural
system of Nature. They cannot innovate, or ch:tng-t·, 01
improve their condition, but a rc bound hy the ru lc•s uf an
unerring fate or law, which is called inslinc·t, :tnt! c:rr•iltlv
by the Druids. But the nearer certain spl'cit·s of anim:tls
are to the "line of liberty" occupied in tltal sy:>.tt·m hy
1\fan, 1he more evidence of intelligence thry manift·st. Tlti-.
animnl spnce is called in D ruidis m, c,dc1rtlll ~·r tl/ln·tf.
or, in classic wrilings, the Circles of TransmigT<IIion.
It was thought that when the sun was "rP-IJnrn"
as a babe from Keridwen on December 22ncl myria<l<>
of lives apart from physical existence emanated n.t
the same time from Keridwen. T hey were lf'd by
the sun from a district of A-mtW1~ and evolved through
the animal creation up to the human. I ntf'ltcct llally,
they were inert without Awen, inspiration, or the
218 The Mys ter ies of Britain
reasoning faculty, imparted to them direct from God
through the sun. The bottom rung of the circle was
in Annw·n, the South, from which all development
arose. An evil man was relegated to that depth in
the circles of progress for which he himself had
qualified during his state of free-will in life which was
regarded as a condition of probation. On the
northern side of the equinoctial line on which human
existence is stationed was Gwynvyd, the H eaven of
the Druids. It was situated, apparently, at the point
attained by the sun at the summer solstice, or in the
Tropic of Cancer.
The Druids believed in the eternity of matter in
an atomic condition, and also in the eternity of water,
and further that the passive or feminine principle of
the divine nature pervaded both. They thought that
at some inconceivably distant period the active
principle of Celi concentrated its energy in the
passive principle of Ced or Keridwen, and as the
result of contact the sun was produced. Under its
influence the atomic elements took solid shape and
became a plastic chaos known as Calen.
The Druids had a zodiac of their own, and the
names of their zodiacal signs are those of the deity's
various emanations which come to the earth through
the sun. Thus they named the vernal equinox Eilir
(second generation), the summer solstice Havhin
(sunny temperature), the autumnal equinox Elved
(harvest), and the winter solstice Arthan (Arthur's
season) when Arthur was engaged in fighting the
powers of darkness. H e is the Sun as Archer,
armed with a bow and arrow, combatting the dark-
ness of winter.
T he whole earth was known as Buarth Beirdd, nr
the Bovine Bardir Enclosure. That is, the earth's
fertility was symbolized by a white cow and thl'
T he W r i t in g s o f " M o r i e n " 219
~f'nerating sun by a white bull. The Avane or
Beaver is said to have been drawn ashore by Hu
Cadarn, and typified the sun disappearing every
evening in the western seas. There were three cows
and three bulls employed as symbols by the Druids
in their sacred cattle-pen or circle. The three bulls
are the aforesaid Plennydd, Alawn, and Gwron, and
the three cows l\lorwyn, Blodwcn, and Tynghedwen-
Oyrraith, who are also found later as the three
sister-spouses of Arthur, personifications of the earth
at the three stages of the year.
T he Druidic trinity, whose operations were illus-
lralcd by the three rays, were the emanations of the
great Creator and not of the sun itself. The sun
was the first bC'gotten of Keridwen, the feminine or
passive principle, and became the agent of th<'
.t\ Imighty in the work of creation, who died
allegorically on every 20th of December, falling into
the sea at St. David's H ead. His three fertilizing
attributes were symbolized by three apples whose
juice contained the divine essence. When the Druids
regarded him as a beaver drawn out of the lake uy
the oxen of H u Gadarn , it was implied that th ·
Creator drew him forth by his emanations and that
the change was not effected by the sun's own energy,
for when the sun grew weak the Creator had to come
to its aid.
The divinity of the sun was symbolized among the
Druids by the wren. A mode of levying contrihu-
tions at Christmas in Wales was to carry a wren
through the village in a small box or paper house',
the bearer singing a song about its pC>vcrty. In the
Isle of 1\fan it was customary to hunt the wren at
the winter solstice, the bird hcing fixed to a lon~
pole with ils wings extended, and afterwards buried.
The symbol really refers to the death of the old sun.
220 The M y s t e ries o ( B rit a in
T aliesin, in one of his poems, aUudes to himself as
a wren, and that the Bard represented the sun seems
clear enough.
Coming to the legend of Taliesin himself, it would
seem that the seventh century bard who calls himself
by this name was really named after the solar deity
who bore the same title. The myth of his being
placed in a coracle alludes to the vessel of the sun,
which was believed by the Druids to be launched
in Sl. George's Channel at Arklow on the Irish
coast and to arrive at Borth in Cardigan Bay. On
the east side of Borth is a vast morass, on the edge
of which is a spot called the Grave of T aliesin, and
a village close by is named T aliesin. T his morass
was covered by high tides before the present railway
bank was constructed. This inlet, or cove, of
Cardigan Bay was evidently in ancient Druidic times
sacred to the mysteries of Taliesin, or the sun,
exactly as Byblus in Phocnicia was to the death and
restoration as a babe of Adonis, who reached that
place in an ark of bulrushes. l n the same manner,
T aliesin in his coracle reached the W eir of Gwyddno.
The coracle is one of the symbols of Keridwen.
Dt.:aling with the myth of Keridwen, "Morien"
goes on to say that the personages in it represent a
solar and cosmic allegory, the dramatis personce nf
the nncient solar drama of the Druids. Avagdd11

was still uncreated and the Cauldron which was 111
assist his appearance boiled for a year and a day-
that is, from December 22nd until the fol\owi n ~~
December 2oth, and forty hr>Urs over. T he cin:11l:u

with the equinoctial line dividing the earth into two
laalves. The northern half, when the sun if' between
1he east and the northern point of the lw;avens, is
under the tlominion of T aliesin, the ::.un. Tht>
southern half, when the sun is between the cast point
and the shortest day, is claimed by Avagddu. It is
a cont<"st Letween summer and winter.
The three drops which inspired Gwinn arc the
Triune vVorcl or Logos of the Creator, tlw three
golden apples and the three bulls. Gwion is the
water lord, the Druidic title o( the Creator in the
work of making order out of chaos. T he lnealitics
Letween Pnntypritld and T onyrefail are associ:Hed
with the allegory, and no doubt rites associat<"cl with
iL were performed on Pontypridd Common, with the
Rocking Stone as the symbolical coracle of the
mysteries.
"Morien" also likens Arthur to Osiris, and draws
several parallels between Arthurian and Osirian
myth. H e then proceeds to deal with the cg~ as
1he symbol o[ the earth and the emblem of th<' wr:u·le
of Keridwen. T he earth's inertness in wintc·r aud
that of the sun at the same season was suppmwd Ln
he due to the principle of Evil, but Keridwcn by
brooding over the world-egg was supposed to
reintroduce its vital force .
[n Druidism [says Moricn] it is supposed lh:al :all !.Ciul;..
have had their generation and birlb from Kl·ridwt·n nntl
Awen in Gwenyd,·a or Elysium and that to c·urHc· fmm
thence to this world they must cross Gwylliunwy ur tlu·
Keltic Styx, traverse Annwn and a~ctnd in the train t~r
the sun on his return on the morning- of tlw Mll:lr Nt·w
Year. Inside the sun is the Ancient of Da}s , ll u (;adarn,
and the luminary's body is his and Kc.-idwt n 's ofT~pring.
Hu Gadarn is the son of the creator Ccli, who is both
his father and mother. The descent is where the sun
descends on the shortest day of winter, and the left and
right of his descent arc Annwn and (;wtnydfa, with the
222 T h e My s t e r ie s o f Brita i n
River Gwyllionwy flowing between. In Druidism soul~;
do not return at the dissolution of their bodies either to
Annwn or Gwenyddfa, but go either lO heaven, or return
to the animal circles of transmigration.
Such , in effect, is the general trend of "Marien's"
writings, which are, in a measure, valuable so far as
his great knowledge of Druidism is concerned, but
which are somewhat diffuse and far too greatly
mingled with Biblical and classical parallels of
doubtful value. H e hac; also much to say regarding
the divine name and the resemblance of H ebrew to
Welsh mythology, as well as the symbolism of the
stone circles, but only here and there do we encounter
anything of value in respect of the actual theology
of the Druids, although their mythology is copiously
enough explained.
CHAPTER XI
DRUIDISM AND THE SECRET TRADITION
IN IRELAND
IT has frequently been stated that Druidism 111
Ireland had not lhe same official sanction as in
Britain. H owever that may be, there can be no
question that it flourished there exceedingly. There
are numerous allusions to Druids and Druidism in
Irish literature, and at these we may perhaps briefly
glance in the first place.
Three Druids are said to have accompanied
Partholan, the first colonizer of Ireland, and the
Nemedians and Fomorians are also said to have
brought Druids with them to Ireland, who pitted
their spells against those of the original inhabitants.
In this case ''Druid'' may simply mean priest or
medicine-man. The Nernedians are said to have
visited the northern parts of Europe, where they
made themselves perfect in the arts of divination,
Druidism, and philosophy, returning after some
generations to Ireland under the name of the T ualha
De Danann.
The chief deity of the Tuatha De D:mann w:.\s
Dagda, who is believed to be the same as thf' Cr(lmm
Cruach, the great idol overthrown by SL. Patrick,
and that his worship was Druidic is unquf'stioncd.
He possessed a cauldron, which differed somewhat
from that of Keridwen in that it was thl' source of
a plentiful food-supply. The Danann people had
three chief Druids, Brian, l uchar, and Iucharba, and
Z2J
224 T h e My s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
two chief Druidesses, Becuill and Danann, beside.c;
a number of subsidiary priests and priestesses. End-
less tales are told of the magical contests of the
Danann Druids with those of the Firbolgs. On one
occasion the Danann Drujds prepared a magical bath
at the battle of .£\Tagh Tuiraidh, which seems strongly
reminiscent of that of the initiates.
We also read of Druids accompanying the
i\lile.c;ian colony, who are sajd to have come from
Greece and to have passed through Scythia and
Egypt in their travels, and thence into Spain, from
which they travelled into Ireland, the Druid Caicher
leading them from the Iberian peninsula to Erin. On
their arrival the Oanann Druids raised such a
tempest as drove them out to sea again, but a Druid
of the 1\lilesians chanted a song so powerful that the
tempest abated.
The earliest reference to a Druidic ceremony in
the ancient Irish writings is that which tells of the
fire lighted by Midhe on the Hill of Uisnech in West
Meath, whirh continued to burn for seven years.
The Druids of 1rcland, however, said that it was an
insult to them to have this fire ignited in the country,
whereupon Midhe had all their tongues cut out and
buried in the earth of Uisnech. The legend of Eta.in,
the Queen of Eochidh, who was spirited away by :1
mysterious strangC'r to the Land of Faery, throw~
some light on Irish Druidical practice. She was
sought by the King's chief Druid, Oallan, who
wamlered throughout Erin for a year without findin~
her. At last he came to Slieve Dallan , where ht·
cut four wands of yew and carved an ogham on them,
when it was revealed to him that Etain was conceak·cl
in the palace of the Fairy King l\Iidir, in the Hill
of 13ri Leith, in the County of Longford. I1<-r
husbanJ had Lhe hill dug upen, Lut the Fairy Ki11~!
Dr u i d is m i n I re 1a n d 225
sent forth ltfty women so closely resembling her that
Eochidh could not recognize his wife until she made
herself known lo him personally. The tale makes
it plain that Irish Druidism employed written or
l·arved magical characters.
\Ve also read o[ the Druids giving draughts of
obli\rion to certain heroes, and divining dreams by
holding a bull-feast and eating of the animals' nesh
and broth , after which heavy repast divinatory visions
were vouchsafed in sleep. A great many referenc.:cs
are made to a certain Cathbad, an Irish Druid of
celebrity, who kept a school or college for instruction
in Bardism and Druidism. Equally numerous tales
are told of the arguments and magical conflicts of the
Druids with Saint Patrick, who converted several o[
them , and it is strange to read in the Leabher Brear
that a D ruid was the first tutor of Saint Columba.
The rites of the Irish Druids are the constant topic
of the ancient Hibernian writings. A method of
producing "illumination" practised by them was
known as the lH1bas Forosnai, or "illumination by
the palms of the hands' ', as described in the Glossary
of Cormac mac Cullinan, K ing a11d Bishop of Casilcl.
compiled about A.D. 8go. H e who wishes to
discover a truth must chew raw red flesh and then
retire with it to his bed, where he shall pronounce
an oration upon it and offer it to his idol gods. If
he does not receive illumination before the [ollnwing-
day he pronounces incantations upon his twn pnlms
and takes his idols into his bed so that he may n11t
be interrupted in his sleep. H c then plac<'s his l wn
hands upon his cheeks and falls asleep. Thf' 11hjcc:t
of this ceremony seems to have been to have- turned
the palms of the hands into illuminating agencies
which would permit the seer to have anything
revealed to him which he sought.
p
226 Th e Mys terie s of Britain
It is told of the Druid Ciothruadh that when he
made a Druidic fire against the men of Munster
his enemies retaliated with a similar conflagration,
which produced a shower of blood. T heir priest,
Moghruith, called for his "dark grey, hornless bull~
hide and white-speckled bird head-piece' ' and other
Druidic instruments, and flew up into the air to quell
the flames. Ciothruadh also ascended, but the Druid
of Mw1ster prev.ailed and he fell to earth.
Moghruith on this occasion was drawn in a chariot
by wild oxen, and turned the Druids of Cormac into
stones, "which are the Flags of Raighne to this
day". This particular Druid, Moghruith, is men·
tioned in documents known to be historically
veracious, and is said to be the ancestor of several of
the ancient famiJjes in Cork, the O 'Dugans,
O'Cronins, and others.
The Irish Druids practised augury from the notes
of birds, the croakings of ravens, and the chirping
of wrens. They observed the stars and clouds for
omens, and also practised poetical divination. They
employed the yew trees, the rowan, and the black
thorn as sacred wood for personal ordeals. They
appear to have been frequently employed as tutors
to princes, and frequently as law-givers. But th<·ir
organization seems never to have been so thorough
or so orderly as that of the Druids of Gaul or
Britain. At the same time it must be borne in mimi
that practically everything we know of them come••;
from sources subsequent to the introduction of
Christianity.
Several ancient nunneries are conjectured to have·
been the retreats of Druidesses, especially tha1 or
St. Bridgit at Kildare, which was once almoHt
certainly a community of this kind. At this place the·

ministered to the sacred conflagration of the ancient
goddess Briginda or Brigantia, which was never
permitted to go out, and which was surrounded by a
fence. or stockade over which no man might climb,
or through the bars of which he might not even peep.
A similar institution may have existed at Tuam, and
O'Connor mentions the Cluan-feart or sacred retreat
for Druidical nuns. The Synod of Drumceat in
A.D. 590 laid certain restrictions on the Druids, who
were officially abolished after the Battle of Moyrath
in 637. So many Druidic ornaments and instruments
have been discovered in Ireland that it is clear the
number of priests maintained in the island must have
been considerable. Nothing, however, is clearer
than that St. Patrick engrafted Christianity upon the
pagan superstition then prevalent in Ireland.
0' Brien, in his book on the Round Towers of
Ireland, observes :
The church festivals themselves in our Christinn
Calendar are but the direct transfers from the Tualhn
De Danann ritual. Thcir very names in Irish are identi-
cally the same as those by which they were distinguished
by that earlier race.
Massey tells us that "an Irish name for Druidism
is Maithis, and that includes the Egyptian dual
Thoth, called Mati, which, applied to time, is the
T erin or Two Times at the base of all reckoning".
But the etymologies advanced in his interesting Book
of the Beginni11gs are suspect, to say the IC'ast of it.
That, as in Wales, Druidism, or at lc;Lo.;t tlw
tradition of it, was preserved in Ircland £
or a~cs is
obvious enough. Walker in his Irish Bards affirms
that the "Order of the Bards continued for
many succeeding ages invariably the same' ' , and
Buchanan, the Scots historian (ca. t58o), found
"many of their ancient customs yet remain ; yea,
228 T he My s t e r i e s o f Br i t a i n
there is almost nothing changed of them in Ireland,
but only cercmonieg and rites of religion".
But in lrebnd , as in Britain, wt~ find the bull, ox,
ur nl\v the !->) mhol 11L \\Orship. The anC'it' lll camps
or sites of the Grey Cow of the D<manns arc still
remembered by the peasantry, and King Diarmuid
Mac Cearbhail, who is described as " half a Druid
and half a Christian'', killed his son for destroying
a sacred cow. Owen Connelan, who translated ''the
proceedings of the greaL Bardic Institution", tells of
a cow which supplied the daily wants of nine score
nuns or Druidesses, concerning which story Hackett
remarks: " The probability is that they were pagan
Oruidcsses, ancl tha t the cows were living idols, like
Apis, or in some sense considered sacred animals."
This evidence collates Irish Druidism with British,
and seems to point to the existence o£ some such
ox-worship in Ireland as that of Hu.
T hat Irish Druidic superstition long survived and
is by no means yet defunct is well known. There
are numerous instances of folk-beliefs in the eff1cacv
of certain stones, for example the Stones of Specula'-
tion, from which it was thought fire could he drawn.
The Brash or Bullan S tones in the County of Cork
and at Glendalough were indented with hollows in
which the devotee placed his knees, dropping an
offering into a basin in the front of the stone, £or tht~
cure of rheumatism. Milligan saw women at
l nnismurray kneeling hcfore standing stones in
worship. Spenser, writing in the time of Queen
Elizabeth, states that he saw the 1rish drink blood
in connection with certain arcane ceremonies.
These are all the remains of Druidic belief, or nl
least of that lower cultus with which it mingled. In
many parts of Jreland it is only recently that tlw
peasantry ceased ro believe in transformation into
0 r u icl is m i n I r e 1a n d 229
.111imal form. All Saints' Day was merely a
perpetuation of the pagan Samhain, which was
:-.acred to the spirits of the dead. On the evt·nin):!
of this festival it was considered dangerous to lw out
of doors, and funeral games, the remains of t h <' ( 'uh
o[ the D ead , were held in the houses. ~llw I rio.;h
practice of keening has frequently been considr ·n·cl
a survival from pagan times. Mrs. llarringtnn,
writing in 1R18, was assured that the kceners wr·Jr·
descendants o[ pagan performers. As in other
countries, well-worship could not be put down in
Ireland, and even to this da)' pilgrimages to wt·lls
are not infrequent, especially to such fountains as ~•rr
presided over b)' Saint Brigit . Within thc~e w<·lls
there were thought to reside mystical fishes, prnhably
the familiars or spirits who guarded it. Offering-s
were made to the spirit in charge of the well ant I tn
the priestess thereof. Now this custom is <"Ill it•·ly
associated with districts where megalithic monunw111 s
prevail, and this justifies the belief that it was
certainly Druidic.
As in Britain, so in Ireland, the cult of the Culdrr·s
followed that of Druidism. The early Christi:111
priests appear to have ,been distinctly " ll:HI"
Christians. In the manuscript of ~fc firhis we· 11·:ul
that : '' The clergr of Erin held many synocls. and
they used to come to these synods with wt·nlu,n•.,
so that pilched battles used to be fou).!ht hctwc···•1
them, and many used to be slain." Thi·' is
reminiscent of the custom of the Druids, whn w<·tr.

symbols of the neighbourhood." They are, indeed,
mentioned a~ the Ceile De in the Annals of the Four
Jfasters, in m nnection with events in the year A. D.
8o6. The Rev. VI/. G. T odd, in his volume on
The Cllurch of S t. Patrick, says that: " The
earliest Christian missionaries found the native
religion extinrt, and themselves took the name of
Culdecs from inhabiting the Druids' empty cells."
So lately as 1595 certain friars in Sligo were alluded
to as Ceile-n-De, and there is frequent mention of
certain Keledci in the thirteenth century. They
upheld the institution of marriage amongst ilie clergy
and their abbacies were frequently hereditary. That
they were suspect of paganism is clear from the
language of Bcde, who says of them that they would
' 'as soon communicate with pagans as with Saxons''.
Archbishop Ussher asserted that the Northern Irish
" continued in their old tradition in spite of various
Papal bulls' '.
Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury was horrified
on hearing that they did not pray to saints, dedicate
churches to the Virgin, nor use the Roman service,
and even St. Bernard in his distant retreat was
g reatly distressed at what he heard of the Irish
Culdees. In his righteous wrath he stigmatized
them as " Beasts, absolute barbarians, a stubborn ,
stiff-necked, and ungovernable generation and
abominable ; Christian in name, b·ttt in reality
pagan' ' . One of the Papal entreaties by which
H enry I I W <\S induced to conquer Ireland related to
the possibility of bringing the Irish into the Christian
Church.
Wild stories were told of the performance of secret
rites by the Culdees, and it was whispered that, like
their Druidic<ll fathers, they buried persons alive
beneath the fanes where they worshipped in order
Druidi s m in Ire land 231
to propitiate the powers of darkness. St. Bernard,
in his Life oj Malachy, Archbishop of Armagh,
states that up w the year 1 I 30 there was none worthy
of being called a Christian monk in the whole of
Ireland. Two islands are situated in the hog of
Monincha. One of these was a monastery for men,
their wives occupying the neighbouring women 's
island. Giraldus Cambrensis, writing of this com-
munity in the twelfth century, called it "The church
of the old religion", and described its inhabitants as
''demons''.
The round towers of Ireland are associated by
tradition with the Culdees. That they arc not
"Christian" in the modern sense is sufficiently
proven by the fact that only in three out of sixty-
three have Christian emblems been found, and even
these have been regarded as modern additions. Nor
are they mentioned in Irish hagiography. The.·}'
appear to be in the same architectural line u( <k"t «'lit
as the 1mraglti of Sardinia and the brochs of Scotl.tnd,
although probably of later date than these. That is,
they were almost certainly referable to a ntc 'n' or
less distant Mediterranean origin. That thc·y may
have been of late Druidic-that is, of Culdf'c· urigin
-seems not at all improbable.
For centuries afterwards the meclirnl knowlt·dgc·
of the Druids survived in Irelanc..J. Druidic nwclie·iru-
is chiefly known from its Irish <'xamples. It is
scarcely surprising to find that tht· :111cil'tll Kc·lt·; of
Ireland regarded all medicinal subc;t;utn·-. a-; llll' g-ifts
of the gods. In early Irish literature wt· find the
god Diancecht credited with all tlw potenti:tlitic"' of
a Keltic IEsculapius, a reputation hf' continued to
enjoy well into Christian times. l lis name signifies
"Swift in Power" , and m:my arC' the lcg-mJ s
recounted of hi!> healing skill. Irw:tlltation-; Jll'llrecd
232 T h e M y s t e r i e s o f B r i t a i n
in the eig-hth c-entury rcve;\1 him as a god who had
long been n'gctnled as a fmtn1 nf medirinal and herbal
lore, and his son anu daug-hter, ~Iidoch and Airmida ,
even appear to havP excelled him in the leech's art.
But the jealousy of Diancecht pursued them, and
he slew ~ fidorh, the innovator. From the younger
leech's grave, however, therf' sprang 365 herbs from
the 365 joinrs and sinews of his body, each
possessing a mighty ,·irtue to heal the diseases of
the part whence it grew. His sister Airmida
garherecl the herbs, classified them and concealed
them in her mantle. But Oiancecht discovered them
and mixed them up so hopelessly that no leech might
henceforth understand their peculiar properties.
The surgeon figures conspicuously in the romantic
tales of the frish Red Branch Knights. In time of
war an entire medical corps under one chief physician
accompanied each Irish army, every leech hearing a
les, or bag, of salves and herbs at his girdle.
A lthough the craft seems to have been recognized
in Ireland from the earliest recorded ages, we
encounter no mention of any individual physician
until the death of 1\Iaelodar O'Tinnri, "the hest
leech in Ireland'', in A.D. 86o. After that period,
however, records of Irish mediciners and surgeons
are frequent, and not a few of them could boast of
Continental as well as national reputations.
Van H elmont, a physician of Brussels, writing on
the state of European medicine at the beginning of
the seventeenth century, remarked that the 1rish
nobility had each their domestic physician who wns
appointed not because of his learning, hut becaww
of his ability to cure disorders. These doctors, lw
says, received their instruction chiefly from hrrr-
ditary writings bcqneathed to t1tem by tlwir
a'ncestors, and employed as cures the productions of
D r u i d i s m i n l r e l a n d 233
their own country. " The Irish," he concludes,
" are better managed in sicknf'ss than 1hC' l1nlians,
who have a physician in every village.''
A large number of Irish medical manuscripts arc
still preserved, and the whole body of ancient medical
writing in Irish is probably the largest in existence in
any language. Th e Book of the 0'Lees, preserved
in the Royal Irish Academy, was written in 1443,
partly in Latin , and partly in Irish. The Boo.k of
the 0 'II·ickeys is even more venerable, having been
translated into Irish in 1303 from the Latin work hy
Bernard Gordon.
In these and other books practically all the
principal diseases aml epidemics we are now
acquainted with are described and specifics for thf•ir
cure recommended. Bubonic plague, phthisis,
alluded to as serg, or "withering", and described in
Cormac's glossary as the disease of " those without
fat", erysipelas, or the teine-bui:rr, the "fire of
swelling'', and tutltle, or cancer, are all enumerated,
and mention is also made of palsy and ague.
Indeed, the training of a surgeon in ancient
Ireland seems to have been a matter of prolonged
and arduous application. He had perforce to g-o
through a long apprenticeship with a skilled
practitioner before he was licensed to ''kill or cure ''.
That the medical system of ancienl Ireland was
of Druidic origin is undoubted, as was that uf Wal1·s,
and its continued practice must have gervcd tu kc·c·p
the Secret Tradition alive, as we may hl' ~un· tlw
one could not very well have' I'Xi!;lc·d wi1hou1 a

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
WE have now reached a stage when the material at
our disposal seems to lend itself to the process of
being summarized in such a manner that we can draw
conclusions therefrom. Some such general con-
densation of the facts already gathered may then be
attempted, and such deductions made therefrom as will
justify the hypothesis not only that a peculiarly British
form of the Secret Tradition actually existed, but that
it is capable of reclamation and reconstruction.
In the beginning we observed that the island of
Britain possessed an almost unique sanctity for the
peoples of the ancient world as a land of mystic and
occult tradition, and this in itself tends to buttress
the main theory set forth in this volume. Surely
such reverence could not have been forLhcoming had
not the general reputation of our island been one
of peculiar sacredness. That the tradition thus
celeb~ated was of almost exclusively native origin,
in r~spect that its tenets came to their fullest fruition
on our soil, was also insisted upon.
T hat the Iberian race from North-West Africa
were the original disseminators of this tradition,
carrying it to Britain on the one hand and Egypt to
the other in the guise of the Cult of the Dead has,
l think, been demonstrated, especially in its histnri<"
aspect as associated with " Iberian" Neolithic culturt'
and its introduction to the British Isles. T he·
voyages of early New Stone Age and Bronze Ag-e
men to our shores, and the erection by them of stone·
monuments, leads to the assumption that they must
also have imported their religious and occult belids.

S u m m ary a nd C o nc Iu s io n s 235
The long barrow men were traders, voyaging from
Spain to Britain, at a period generally placed at
about 2000 B.C., and that they had embraced the
Cult of the D ead is proved by their burial customs.
Other races followed them, but although their
religious beliefs have left certain traces, the aboriginal
Cult of the Dead remained the official faith, and
absorbed all others of later introduction, the K f'ltic-
peoples embracing its principles and grafting their
mythology upon it to a great extent. This it wn.s whith
rendered the faith of Urilain unique in Et1ropc, :1nd
caused the peoples of the Continent to regard it as the
exemplar and prototype of the ancient faith ofthe W t•sL.
TJ:e argument that it is "absurd to argue that the
W estern barbarians taught the E gyptians and C retans
the Cult of the Dead" was countered by the theory
that it emanated from a common centre in llwrian
North-\Vest Africa, and proofs were brought to hc·ar
to justify this contention, especially the colonization
of E gypt by people of Iberian stock and the l'xistctHT
of certain survivals, like that of the suppos<"d l{t·lti•·
rite of Bealtai1m in Morocco at the present clay.
The theories of Mr. T. D. Kendrick rdatiw· to
the cult of Druidism were then reviewed, and a
justification of the theory that Druid tradition" clid
survive was attempted. Moreover, his argumt·Jtt
that no official caste of Druids existed in Britain wa!-.
contested. At the same time it was ngr 't'<l that llw
circles of Britain were not built by tlw I huicls,
although the development of Druidism was a....sm iatcd
with them, and the Druids mad<' lJ<;t· of tlw111.
Druidism, it was concluded, arosl' nlll nf a Cult of
the D ead which had gradually bcc'n taking form
during the Old Stone Age, and whid1 i11 dtt• New
Stone Age had been disseminated from North-W est
Africa to Britain on the one hand and Egypt on the
236 T h e Myster ies o f Br ita i n
other. At the commencement of the Iron Age it
became segregated in this island and took on the
colours of its <>nvironmcnt. Classical pass;tges were
adduced lo ouuress the theory that Druidism W:IS
the Cult o( the De:~d in another form, and instances
of Keltic lx:licCs ronnef'leJ with the Cult were also
brought forw:~rd, stress being laid on the fact that
it did nol so much embody the Pythagorean doctrine
of metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls, as
that of direct reoirth as obsen·ed in the ancient belief
that fairies were the souls of the dead awaiting
re-introduction into a new mortal existence.
The Druidic Cult of the Dead arose from an
admixture of Keltic religion and the faith of the
older cultus, the Iberi:1n religion which had preceded
it in Britain. ll was, in a word, the North African
Cult of the Dead localized and, later, Kelticizcd. It
passed through the same early phases as in Egypt,
but later began to take on the hue of its environment.
The Druids were a well-defined priestly class with
sub-divisions having different functions, magical,
administrative, and bardic, but that the cult practised
by these ministers was fairly high in the scale of
religions is induhitnble. T hey possessed a system 0f
..vriting whi<'h they appear to have developed of
themselves, and which was known as the Ogham.
Under Roman persecution they only seemed to
disappear, and there is good evidence both from
\Vales, Ireland, ami Scotland that they confronted
the Christian missionaries, and it seems not al all
improbable that they flourished for centuries after
that under the name o[ Culdees.
Reviewing the material, doeum<'ntnrr ~md ot lwr
wise, whit·h helps us to a proper unrlerstanding nl
the mystical liLeraltm! of the BriLish Kelts, we fiud
this, so far as the 13rythonic KelLS of \Vales an·

concerned, derived from the Mabinogimz, the W elsh
triads, dating probably from the twelfth century, hut
containing lore greatly more anriem , the sn ctlled
Btwh of TcliiL'~in, and so fonh. I think I h:w1·
!'hown that the c-riticism directed again!>l the 11(1 1111
fides of these works was decidedly strained, and that
there was nothing inherently impossible in th(> idea that
they enshrined fragments of the ancient British mystic-
ism. Negative criticism has to explain the prcscnn·nf
hundreds of surviving superstitions in Brita in at tlu·
pr<'scnt time which are known to be of Druidic ori1!i11.
In Tlte B ook of Taliesin we encounter tlw
m}'Lhological group Keridwen, her son 1\ vagddu,
and her servant Gwion, whose allegory has ht•t'll
mentioned so often as to need no recapitulatio11 lwn·.
The Druidic bards who lived and s:mg undcr tlw
Welsh princes unanimously represent Keridwen a~
presiding over the mysteries of their ancient cult.
which also seems to be associated with the caste' nf
the Pheryllt, who dwelt in the city of Emrys. in tilt'
Snowdon country. The rites of KcridWC'Il wn1·
certainly those of initiation , and her myth i" a11
allegory of the initiatory ceremony, of whid1 tlwn·
are many notices in Welsh literature and in t·b ssi,·;d
writings on the subject of the Kelts.
vVe next come to the consideration of I he· voluuu-
known as Barddas, collected hy loin 1\Inrg-:u1wg
and published by the W elsh 1\l SS. Scwiety i11 t ~fl.:,
which purports to be a collec-tion of nrigi11al dnt'u
ments illustrating the theology of tlw l>ruid.... Its
editor, the Rev. J. VJillinms ah hhC'I, givt"; it : L
t.; hi"
opinion that the bards from the fourlc·t·IHh to tlw
seventeenth cenntry vit:wcd 1he tradit inns of the
Gorsedd as the genuine remains of a1wicnt I)ruidism,
and that there is every n·asnn to hC'Iit·vc 1hat in thc·ir
main features they were sc1. Tht· matf'rialof Darddas,
238 The Myste ries of Britain
its editor believed, had been collected chiefly from
the works of these bards, who seem to have regarded
Christianity as the fulfilment of Druidism.
The first book of Barddas deals with the origin
of letters ancl the secret writing of the Bards and
with the name of God. The second book bears on
their theological ideas and mystical teaching, wherein
it is set forth that God or goodness is opposed to
Cythrmtl or darkness. God united Himself with
helplessness with the intention of subduing it to Life
or Goodness, which began in the depths of A1mwn,
made its way into A bred, from which it was possible
for it to reach the circle Gwyuvyd, the cycle of·
immortal beings, the still higher circle of Ceugant
being reserved for God alone.
Included in the section on the theology of the
Druids is the ''Book of Bardism'' by the Bard
Llywelyn Sion which he states has been extracted
from more ancient writings which he specifies. It
is couched in the form of question and answer
between the Bard and his disciple, and contains the
allegory of the progress of Life from A1mwn upward .
Here also is described the nature of awen or inspira-
tional vision from God.
In the third book, the "Book of Wisdom", we
find the doctrines of the elements, the parts of man,
the cycles of the years and months, which are
followed by the "Book of Privilege and Usage",
dealing with the laws and regulations of Bardism.
The superficial resemblance of the ideas found in
Barddas to certain systems of Eastern philosophy
and theology must not, however, lead us to suppose
that it had in reality an Oriental origin.
Turning now for the evidences of the survival of
native arcane beliefs to the medireval literature of
Britain, we find in the work of Geoffrey of
S umma ry and Conclusions 239
Monmouth a certain residuum of these. H e mentions
not a word about Druidical training or practice , but
there are references to pagan priests or Aamens in
his volume which appear to me to refer to the
Culdees. It is also of interest that it is in his pages
that we first meet with the legend that the building
materials of Stonehenge were brought from Africa
by the giants of old, and I think his account is a
distorted memory of the manner in which they were
conveyed [rom West to East.
Arthurian literature may be divided into twn
sections, that which was the work of Welsh bards
and arose out of \Velsh tradition, and that composc.:d
in English and Norman-French. The occult
traditions which it enshrined were clearly dditwd in
the literature of the GraiJ. Its dramatis person: ... is
Keltic, and derives both from Brythonic and Coirll'lir
sources. That Arthur was a god of the cuhun.·-lwro
type is obvious enough. Anempting to dis(·ovcr
remnants of the mystical tradition relating tn him in
the ancient Welsh poems, we lind him nwntiotwd in
five of them by name, and especially in thai know11
as "The S poils of Annwn", which is a pcWtll nf tilt'
type of the " Harrying of Hell", ancl prohaltly

rites which necessitated a real or allegorical passage
through a lower plane from which mystical secrets
and treasures might be reft. Such instances may be
found in the legend of Thomas the Rymour, Merlin
himself, and in the book of the Rev. Robert Kirk,
Minister of Aberfoyle in 1691.
The literature of the Grail also contains certain
evidences of the survival and continuance of this
tradition in Britain for centuries. Its dramatis
personce are merely those of Keltic myth in another
shape, the Cauldron of Anwwn is, indeed, the Grail
itself. The whole legend of the Grail, though
diverted to Christian uses, is i11deed entirely derived
from sources which may well be described as
Druidical, and there is actual traditional continuity
between the poem of "The Spoils of Annwn" and the
Grail Legend, which also contain a large number of
referencesto the personagesof\Nelsh myth. TheGrail
Castle is merely the Palace of Caer Sidi in A mzwn.
Examining later British legend, custom, and
festival for evidences of the survival of ancient cult,
we find that a good deal of material concerning it
has survived through these media. The idea of
A nnwn, for example, still survives as a part of
modern Welsh folklore, although strangely enough
that contains no reminiscences of the other planes
in the mystic circle. There is considerable evidence
that Arthur in his mythological aspect superseded
a certain H u Gadarn, the hero responsible for
dragging the Avane from the lake by means of his
oxen. By some means Arthur became confounded
with this Hu and took over his attributes and adven-
tures; both were, indeed, phases and "names" of the
solar deity, and it is clear that the rites associated
with them survived until the middle of the sixteenth
century, the image of Darvel Gadarn being adored in

the Diocese of SL. Asaph so lately as •sJR, when his
idol and priest were taken to Smithrield in Londou and
burned . In the superstition concerning fairy changC'-
Iings, too, we seem to find a distinct trace ofa belief in
the return of the soul to A1
mwn, the changeling beinga
soul struggling to geta hold on A bred, the earth-plane.
In the popular superstitions, too, associated with
sacred wells we find good evidence that a recognized
caste of celebrants or priests actually existed within
living memory, as statements by Lewis, Fulke, and
Rhys clearly demonstrate , and it seems, too, that the
cult of witchcraft retained certain associations of the
aboriginal beliefs with which the Secret T radition had
to a certain extent become interpenetrated. There
is also a good deal of evidence that a strong leaven
of the ancient cult of Hu survived in certain parts of
Scotland until a relatively late period. and the
Cauldron of Keridwen seems to have been known in
the same localities in which these ideas flourished.
Many of the Druidic rites, the details of which are
known to us, cast light upon the nature of the Secret
Tradition. It seems probable that H u was the god
of the oak and mistletoe cult, the oak-tree in an
anthropomorphic or man-like shape, as the idol of
Darvel Gadarn, burned at Smithfield, appears to
have been. Bulls were sacrificed to the mistletoe-
bearing oak in Druidic times, and these, we know,
were symbolic of H u. 1t seems probable, too, that
the mistl<'loc, as the symbol o[ the ess<·ncc of Iif<', il ~
protoplasm, sn L
o spc·ak, was introduced into IIH' 1iltt:tl
of initiatinn of th<' Srcn~l T raclition, just as wlwal wa!>

242 T he M. y s t eries o f Brita in
We find in the rites associated with the festival of
Gog and 1\1agog some reminiscences of the Secret
Tradition and also in those of Godiva a certain bearing
upon them, for Ogmios and Briginda were deities of
knowledge, and the l..1tter may have presided over the
female department of the mysteries.
If we turn now to the higher philosophy of British
mysticism as expressed in Barddas, we find the
Supreme Power described as inconceivable and
incomprehcnsiLie. The allusion seems to be to Hu,
who is further identified with the H eus and H esus of
the Gauls, alluded to as the supreme proprietor of
the [sle of Britain in Welsh myth, and who appears
to have been symbolized by the ox, much as the Apis
bull represented Osiris. That H eus was also
represented in ox form is practically certain, and a
number of Keltic place-names suggest that they were
sites of a bull cult. His abode was in Ceugant,
which was probably regarded as the sun itself.
The necessary obligations of man are set forth as
suffering1
change and choice, and his equiportions as
Ab,·ed and G~uym>yd, necessity and liberty, evil and
good, to which he has the power of attaching himself
as he pleases. This assumes a Western doctrine of
human free-will, although there seem to be certain
associations with the "doctrine of escape" 1 as
observed in Oriental systems. In the "Sentences
of Bardism'' and the ''Ten Commandments of the
Bards'' in the Bltte Book the penetrations of Christian
thought are obvious, but at the same time there is
certainly a residuum of more pristine theology. In
the native British mysticism the idea of struggle,
of evolution, is stressed more as a natural and
necessitous course, an act o£ psychic growth, ratht'r
than a definite philosophical path, such as is set forth
in the Eastern philosophies. T here is indeed less
S u m m a r y a n d Co n c1u s i o ns 243
stress of choice placed on Man in the British system,
the entire cosmic machinery appearing to be more
imperative or arbitrary, although great stress is laid
upon the value to the soul in this development of
scientific knowledge, which seems to hasten the
process of psychic growth, and it was probably for
this reason that the desire for initiation was so strong.
At the same time we find that a certain amount
of contributory action is essential on the part of man,
and that his efforts must be in unison with that which
is in Lhe circle of G-&ynvyd.
The basic foundations of A bred, or the Earth-
plane, are the predominance of opposition in Cythraul
over prosperity and amendment, necessary lawless-
ness and death ensuing from the mastery of Cythraul,
showing that the state of A bred was regarded as a
dreadful necessity, that life on the Earth-plane could
never be a happy experience. In Gwynvyd, the
happier plane of spirits, good predominates over evil
and memory reaches from the beginning of the soul's
evolution of Annwn, so that perfect judgement and
understanding may prevail. That is, the secrets of
Death must be plumbed and accurately understood
before the soul can triumph over them. This casts
light on the allegory oE the descent of H u or Arthur
into the depths of Anmm~, showing that not only did
he seek the Cauldron of Inspiration, but sought· to
gauge the secrets and mysteries of death, whic-h
knowledge was part of the initiation of the brother·
hood of the Secret Tradition. In hoth tlw E.g-ypti:1n
and Christian r<'ligions the pnwC'rs of dl'ath arc·

probability the :tlll~g-ory of the d('S<

244 T he My s t e r i e s o f Br i t a i n
of initiation of the Secret T radition. Ccoesar assures
us that Druidic initiates underwent a very long course
of preparation before they reached adeptship, which
can only sig nify that the rites in connection with
this were secret. An arcane brotherhood, the
Pheryllt, actually existed, and that this was associated
with the rites of the Cauldron is clear. The poem
"The Chair of Taliesin" describes the apparatus and
ceremonial associated with initiation, and we find that
these rites were actually in use so late as the twelfth
f"t·ntury, when I Iywel, Prince of North Wales, under-
went initimion, the actual site of the ceremony being
indicated in the poem whirh speaks of the event.
T he question whether the Druids actually made
use of the stone circles in Britain was touthed upon,
after which an ancient poem was described which
appears to have been used on occasions of initiation
as a formula of introduction for approaching the gate
of the sanctuary, and which has a resemblance to the
usages prevailing in the Eleusinian mysteries. T he
myth of the Cauldron of Keridwen was then dis-
sected, in view of certain passages in it which seem
to have reference to thf! transformations of the goddess
in the allegorical portion oE the mysteries, lesser and
higher, and that part of them in which the neophyte
was plunged into the waves in a coracle was further
described as revealing the last ordeal of the initiate.
With regard to the question as to whether the stone
circles commonlv attributed to the Druids were ever
employed by th~m for religious or mystical purposes,
we found that though they were certainly not built in
what we now call Druidical times, that they may have
been proto-Druidic, and that a good deal of evidence
exists that they were made use of at a later period
in connection with the Secret Tradition. Davies
believed that the stone circles were modelled on that
Sum mar y a nd Co n c l us ions 245
of the Zodiac and that Taliesin or the sun was reprc-
!>entctl by the stone in the midst o[ them, whilst the
surrounJing monoliths symbolized the constella tions.
Cacr S idi, he says, means the Circle of Revolutions,
an astrological refere nce, and one Druidic grove at
least was known as the "magnificent celestial circle".
It is also clear rrnm the poem of Prince Hywel that he
made usc of the stone circle at Arvon which, Davir:s
believed, was constructed upon astronomical principles.
But the stone circles appec'l.r to have some bearing
upon the philosophy set forth in Bm·ddas, with its
cosmogra phy of the Universe described in circles,
and it seems likely that Druidism mingled with an
older religion which had as its basis this cirwlar
cosmography, or, alternatively, it may have adapted
the stone circles to this cosmography, likening the
outer circle to A bred, a nd the inner to G·wynvyd.
Jn a ny case we know that the Druids worshipped in
circular groves, and finding stone groves ready
erected a nd to their hands, they may have adapted
them to their worship.
So far as the writings of Owen Morgan or
"Marien" are concerned they exhibit an extra-
ordinary knowleclge of Druidic lore, but are almost
ine xtricahly mingled with classical and Eastern
mysticism. I Ic tells us that the Druids belie w ei the

the evolution of animal species commented on. T he
Druids had a Zodiac of their own and the names of
its signs are those of the deity's various emanations.
The whole eanh was known as the '' Bovine Bardic
Enclosure'', and was symbolized by a white cow, and
the generating sun by a white bull. The D ruidic
trinity, whose operations were illustrated by the three
rays, were the emanations ofthe Creator and not ofthe
sun itself, who was supposed to die allegorically on
every twentieth (25th) of December. H is three fertili-
zing attributes weresymbolized by threeapples, whose
juice contained the divine essence. The divinity of
the sun was symbolizedarnong the Druidsby thewren.
The myth of Keridwen, says "Morien",
represents a solar and cosmic allegory, and the three
Jrops which in!.pired Gwion are the triune word of
the Creator, the three golden apples and the three
bulls. In Druidism all souls are supposed to have
had their birch from Keridwen and Awen, and to
come from thence to this world they must cross the
Keltic Styx, traverse Annwn and descend in the train
of the sun on his return on the morning of the solar
new year. On the dissolution of their bodies souls
do not return to Annwn or Elysium, but go either to
heaven, that is Gwyn1Jyd, or return to the animal
circles of transmigration.
If now we attempt to draw conclusions from the
mass of facts brought together in this book, we will
hardly be able to refrain from the admission that the
British islands have been the horne of a Secret
Tradition on gmating in prehistoric times and
probably in North-East Africa. Probably between
A.D. 200 and about A.D. 600 there A
ourished in
Britain an Iberian religion associated with a solar
cultus, the priests of which raised the great stone
circles which stand in the more deserted portions of
Summary a nd Conc lu s io n s 247
the island. On the invasion of the Kelts about
6oo n.c., this relig ion was to a great extent adapted
to their peculiar psychological needs.
If we examine the pantheon which seems to have
been more peculiarly sacred to the initiated Druids,
we do not find it to be quite the same as that more
generaiJy to be encountered in Brythonic myth. We
have, indeed , considerable difftculty in tracing its
origin. In this peculiar wltus we hear little or
nothing of the Children of Don, of Llyr, Manannan,
and the other more conspicuous deities of the
Brythons, many of whom are said to have been more
or less of local origin only. Hu Gadarn is
undoubtedly one and the same with the Continental
god Esus, but Keridwen, Gwion or Taliesin, Arthur,
Avagddu and the rest appear to have no Continental
affiliations. Indeed they, too, seem to be localized
in Wales, though we certainly find strong resem-
blances to K eridwen in the goddess Bt·igantia of the
English lVIidlands and North , and in the Irish D anu.
But the pantheon of the cult appears to be in some
respects equated with that of the I rish Dagda, who
also owned a magic cauldron, and whose myth, as
well as that of Bran, helped to the making of the
Grail story. Now there is nothing more positive
than that the Grail literature , or at least a consider-
able portion of it, represenlc:; the allegorical
compositions of n bony nf poets who were members

down from very ancient sources. \Ve have evidence
of the J escem ,,f manuscript and traditional material
being hequc·atlted from century to century in a
very much ruder state of civilization than that which
obtained in \Vales from the time of the sixth century
to 186o, therefore there is no good reason for regard-
ing the material of Barddas with dubiety. It repre-
sents, indeed, precisely what might be expected from
a collection of manuc;cripts dealing with a national cult
and handed down from century to century, that is, it
constitutes a strange blend of "period" ideas. The
marks of many centuries are on it, and the acute
student will see for himself the evidences it bears not
only of frequent transcription, but of epochal fashion.
The general resemblance of the philosophy set
forth in Ba,·ddas to certain systems of the Orient is
scarcely to be accounted for by any far-fetched
theories of early Eastern influence in Britain. W e
certainly do hear of l\lirhraism and of the worship of
Serapis and the introduction of other Oriental cults
into Roman Britain, and it is not at all improbable
that Druidism may have been coloured by their ideas.
Moreover, the Druids of l\farseilles were certainly
closely in touch with Hellenic thought, which they
must have passed on to their Gallic and British
brethren. But all rhis is far from saying that these
cults had a powerful or lasting effect on the general
corpus o£ Druidic belief. The Druids were by no
means barbarians, and were probably equally well
versed in religious lore with the priests of Mithraism
or any of the other contemporary cults, and , judging
from this, it seems to me highly improbable that they
would embrace the tenets o[ a foreign faith in
preference to their own. There were, of course,
points of resemblance, but I for one certainly do not
subscribe to the notion that Druidic religion was a
Summ a r y a nd Con c Ius i o n s 219
thing of Aux, unfixed as regards its ceremonial . r.nd
shadowy in its mythology. The wholt> <'vidt'llt't',
indeed, points in the other direction. T he ('lllirl'
efficacy of a rite residerl in tht• traditional mannc·r in
which it was carried out, and that the J), uicls
tlelib~rately adopted t-.Iithraic, Serapic or other c:<olic
rituals is, to me, unthinkable . The ''foreign" intro-
duction had taken place centuries prior to the coming
of the Romans, and the resemblance bet" een
Druitlism and some other systems is obviouslr tlue
to a much more early common orig in.
Perhaps a reconstruction of the broader aspects
of the ancient British mystical cult might follow some
such lines as these : The sun was regarded as the seat
anti centre of the divinity, Hu, H esus or T aliesin,
who, it was believed, occupied a chair or throne in
the huL of its golden wheel. H is demiurges, Cdi and
Keridwen, were responsible for the drudgery of
material creation. The earth was the Cauldron of
Kcridwen, the matrix, as it were, of the divine
mother, into which the fecundating essence of Celi
was introduced. rn its other aspects this cauldron
was a sacred coracle, the moon, which brought
embryonic matter to the earth across the ocf':tn.
Symbolically, too, the sun was regarded as a white
bull and the earth as a white cow. Now tlw"c
several ideas make it plain to tlw StucJent or
mythology that the cult which cmhrat·C'd llwm all

250 Th e Mys teri es of Brita in
Anglo-Saxon mythology, but that is not to say that
it arose from these sources, although it may well have
had a common origin with them. The beginnings of
the Cauldron story have more than once been
attributed by Keltic scholars to Norse influence on the
coasts of the Principality. But there is more than
one serious objection to the acceptance of such a
theory, the chief being that it does not at all account
for the existence of a similar myth on the Jrish side
of St. George's Channel, which is authenticated as
having had an existence long before the Norse
invasions of Ireland and Wales.
So far as the "topography" of the various circles,
spheres or planes alluded to in the Brythonic mystical
writings is concerned, we must imagine this to have
been modelled in the first instance upon the line of
the sun's passage through the heavens. Man was
thought of as occupying the equinoctial part of that
line and the sun appeared to rise from Amrwn, which
bears a strong resemblance to the Egyptian abyss
Nu, through which Ra-Osiris, the sun-god, passed
nightly. He traversed Abred, or the physical
world, and sank at night into Gwynvyd. This was
possibly the earliest and most materialistic type of the
myth, but later these regions or planes must have
been regarded as having a less positive aspect.
Moreover in subsequent centuries, Amvwn appears
to have been located in the south and G·wynvyd in
the north. This is, for example, the exact reverse of
the Norse idea of the places of reward and punish-
ment. At a still later period, however, it is almost
certain that A mmm and Gw;mvyd were not localized
any more than the heaven or hell of Victorian
theology, although at a decadent period later folk-
lore placed the latter in various ·welsh localities.
For these are only the rude beginnings of our
S u m m a r y a n d Co nc1us ion s 251
British mystical system, as is the conception that tJ1e
earth was a" Bovine Bardic Enclosure". T he learned
priests of the Secret Tradition of D ruidism bad
undoubtedly by the twelfth century soared (ar aLovc
such primitive notions, and had come to regard the
entire mystical topography of their predecessors a.<>
useful only from the point of view of allegory. They
had become states of the soul, psychological planes,
rather than precise and definite regions. BrieAy, life
was regarded as evolving in its lower forms from the
plane of Annwn, th e great cauldron or abyss of
unspecialized soul-force, and a.c; materializing on the
world-plane of Abred, the sphere of trial, test, and
experiment. On this planethewholedramaofmateri~l
evolution was worked out, from animaltohumanform.
If found worthy, it passed on to Gwynvyd, the
sphere of the conscious and wholly developed spirit.
T he scheme unde rlying the whole conception is
thus fully apparent. Annwn is the sphere in which
crude psychic material or soul-force is stored and
created, Allred that in which it takes physical form,
the stage in which it is rudely hammered into shape,
and G?vynv:vd, the plane in which it reaches
perfection. rt will thus be seen that the first two
are not ends in themselves, but are merely con-
tributory to the last, that D ruidic philosophy did not
believe that man was a n end in himself. but that he
was only a phase in the work of psychic pror!uctifm
and pcrfc·ction. Thf" intention of the· Crr·atnr was to
shape a nd rrlinc> the spirit 11f man in various rrurihlt'~.

forefathers must have been associated with the
endeavour to assist the soul out of its travail on the
earth-plane of Abred into that of Gwyn-vyd. ll is
also clear that the intention was to fit the human
spirit for passage into G·wywvyd ·while still alive,
and it would seem, from what we know of the Druidic
course of tuition, which we are told often occupied
twenty years, that this initiation may have frequently
taken place rather late in life ; indeed that, just as a
bard was not admitted to the higher circles of his
office until he had "grown a long beard", in all
likelihood religious initiation would not occur until
he was of fairly mature age. The initiatory
ceremony \vas, indeed, the end of a long spiritual
course of instruction and meditation which prepared
the neophyte for the higher soul-life.
As we have seen, the aiiC'gory of the descent into
Anmuu was certainly enarted during the celebration
of the lesser mysteries, and it is only reasonable to
suppose, although we have no proof of this, that the
higher mysteries opened to the adept the spiritual
gates of Gwynvyd. We must bear in mind that
the Cauldron of Inspiration , although situated in
A llwwn, contained the three drops of inspiration
which had fallen from the creative deity, and which
were later, through skiHul priestly mythical inter-
pretation, defined as the three golden apples and the
three sacred bulls. These drops contained the logos
or \\ford of God, afterwards translated by Christian
symbolism into the rich sacramental pabulum of the
Grail. It was, indeed, the mystical influence of that
divine essence partaken of during- the rite oE initiation
which made the initiate free of the higher plane.
T hese drops, which, I bdieve, ''ere <;ymbolized uy
the mistletoe berry, were regarded not so much ac;
the essence of material !Jut of '>piritual life. Onu·
S u m mary a n d Con c Ius i o n s 253
only had they fallen from the sphere of Ceugant, and
then into A m zw1t, the Cauldron of soul-force, where
alone they could be obtained. Rescued from thenre,
they became the obvious mystical means o{ union
with the Creator, for to partake of His essence was
to be of His train. It is the act of Sacrament in
another form, the iciea that if the flesh of the god is
partaken of psychic unity with him is attained.
Of course , it is obvious that there has been a great
deal of confusion as regards the several planes of
K ymric mysticism. For example we find Annw1t
in some places regarded as a horrible abyss, a kind
o( Shea!, at other times as a mere germinating place
for life , yet again as a dim territory nol unlike this
world and even as a species of Avallon. These
different phases apply, of course, to different periods
of belief, and in the end Annwn has become the
abode of E
oJklore fairies. But its real character is
as a species of psychic crucible, a matrix of souls, and
:11l the legends which have clustered round it are
merely accretions on the origina) belief. A nmrm is the
Cauldron o( Keridwen itself. l n short, it is Keridwen
herself, the great teeming Mother of Nature.
Into this cauldron, or matrix, the three fertilizing
drops fall from Celi, the male counterpart of
Keridwen. Now, to anyone with only a 'prentice
knowledge of mythology the basic nature of the myth
we have hr:rc becomes perfectly plain. It is the

the primeval abyss. The cosmology which the
creation story of the Druids most resembles is that
of the Hindus as given in the Rig-Veda, in which
Karma, the primal germ of mind, the bond hetween
entity and non-entity, shot its kindling ray across the
drear abyss, energy or desire impinging upon
chaotic matter. ]ust as the learned Hindu pundits
very speedily embroidered this primitive story by
superimposing upon it all kinds of erudite specula-
tions, so did the Druids in the case of their own
particular myth. But perhaps the best reason for
stating that they owed nothing to either Egyptian or
Hindu sources is that we find practically the same
story in the Japanese Nihongi, where the egg of
chaos in its clearer part became H eaven, while the
yoke became Earth, an object like a reed shoot
appeared between Heaven and Earth, and life began.
We find the self-same ideas among certain American
tribes, in Peru, among the Zuni Indians and elsewhere,
proving conclusively that it is a type of creation-myth
exceedingly venerable. There is, indeed, nothing
so dangerous as to posit relationships and borrowings
between early mythical systems. The probability is
that they sprang from a distant and common origin.
As I have shown elsewhere, we find the idea of a
primeval abyss common to Egypt, Babylonia, India,
Scandinavia, the K elts and some North American
Indians, and the creation of life or matter either by
spoken word or the dropping of the fertilizing agency
among Egyptians, Hebrews, Kelts and Central
Americans. But there is always a distinction, and
the Keltic myth bears in its terms an individuality,
and in its subsequent elaborations an original treat-
ment which we do not find reproduced elsewhere.
A study of the material preserved in Barddas will
show that the philosophy set forth therein must have
S u m m a r y a nd Conc 1us i o n s 255
developed through many generations and centuries
on peculiarly Keltic lines. [ t is altogC'thcr beside
the point to say that here and there, as for example
in the doctrines of the E lements, and the Materials
of 1\Ian there are reminiscences of Egyptian or
Oriental thought. One might as well say that Keltic
thought obtrudes itself into Egyptian theology.
These resemblances merely arise fro·m the circmn-
sta.nce of a common origin and nothing else can
explain them. The notion that Egyptian thought
leavened the whole earth is not only exceedingly
crude, it is entirely gratuitous. No doubt, fragments
of Egyptian belief found their way to Britain as
elsewhere, but that they arrived here at such a period
as seriously to affect British religious thought while
in its creative phase is a little bizarre . That a sirniJiar
theory of Egyptian influence has been applied to
American religion is sufficient to prove its absurdity,
even though the association is alleged to have been
at a relatively late period. Not only would Egyptian
philosophy have found itself faced with prejudices of
the most powerful kind, but as it could only have
penetrated to Britain at second or third hand, its
influences must have fallen harmlessly against the
defences of the entrenched native faith. Those
IJruids who battled so strenuously against Roman
invasion and the proto-Druids, their predecessors,
wC'r<' rcrtainly not easily mncnable to novel idcns.

very original and individual type of mysticism as well
as the extraordinary difficulties of the subject permit,
and I believe that even the most biassed protagonist
of the superiority of Oriental and other mystical
systems will admit that there is much to be said for
the thesis I have advanced. I cannot pretend that
that thesis is complete in all its parts, but I am con-
vinced that a sure foundation has been laid and that

in the restoration of the entire f::thric- of British native
