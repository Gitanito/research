Gallbladder surgery botched, which lead to the surgeons ignoring the fact that I had bile backing up in my body cavity, which in turn was causing my organs to shut down one by one over a course of ten days. I ended up having over nineteen pounds of bile in my body cavity when they decided to do something, and at this point I was almost dead.
