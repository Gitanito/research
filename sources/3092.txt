PREFACE.
lr lS TRUE that the foHowing lectures are either fiction, or reaTi-
ty: if the former •~ true. the puulic will be deceived nearly egnally
with the editor und pul>li;;hers ;-if the revelations (1) possess no more
reality than the ma~s of exciting not•els which have flooded nnd inju-
red the public by findiug thetr wn_v by hundreds, into every periodical
~nd ne,'~<·s room in our cities and villages; thence to, nod exciting the
passions of~he mullitudes, who seek them with enrnestnes~;-we ~hall
feel thnt we have inflicted a deeper wound upon society and committe{.}
a greater wrong than timtt could eradicate ;-but jf they are ag tPley
mny nppenr to be, unren I irt poi-nt offacl, from the moral tone they
breathe. they can hn\'e no other than a benign inHLJehce upon the pub-
lic mind and help to correct and restrain some of the revolting n111J
clnngerous of public and secret wrongs flint nre gnawing upon the vi-
tal~ of society and pro:;trnting the finer n:ad hnppier feelings of hu-
rnnnit y. If therefore, the Re,·e1arioni should poss~s no more rent
trulh, and ha"e no oLher than the influence of a mere moral tale, nnd
be the me&ns of nwakening but few to reflect uport the mftgnitude of
their wrongs, so far as to know that "sin canr10t go unpu,ished," we
w JU ld fee) parttally justified f1.>r sending ll u moral netion" i11lo the
world.
llrH if, on a perusal of the lectures in iheir order, there is nothing
found rnore deep, penelrnting, searchin~, convincing, nnd more ernin-
cnlly usiful th"n \\ould be found in a mere noveJ, our high arrtJcipn·
tions will not be realized, and the pnramoum design of the publica,ion
will be frm,:rated.
The lectures are expres~ed in plain and simpJe language, without
reference to its nice and critical construction, and we prefer, ns we are
instructed by the Clairvoyant \\ heu tn n m~tgnedc or positive ::stare, to
retuin the form and si11qdiC'ity of expre~s~on. Where we bave m&do
mistakes in wri1ing out the manuscr;pt, he has informed and correcteLl
us, without any suggP~Iion or ba-.ing the copy prese11t-thus correct.
ing errors that would ha,·e escapeJ our notice , and 6howir1g in tht~, O.$
in many other iustunces, the superiority of f1fll perception,.
Besides, in connexion with the app!lndix to these tecrures, the stub-
born fncts there given, and the expo~itions which the le<:tort>S them-
selves must evino' to the attentiYe .reader, woultl ruther show more-
reality tbao fiction.
If therefore, on a cand;;J exllmination, tTl(~ truth of the principl'P·"
1hould nppear viain and inteUig1ble,the~r bea~ty ,irni)Ortnn~e, Mt>ral anJ
,you r finger upon a hot iron and the pain would immediately pn~:: nlong

In spenking of some of tbe benefits of mngnctism. I shotdcl tH~CM­
~nrily speak uf 1he iucalculab]e good which m1 1~t r~:-;ult fi'C'Ill lncic-
pcnucnt Clai rvoyance. or clear sighteunc:-;s. And in order that this
::;ubject may oppC'ar plnin to your undctsH111rli11gs, l will explain it~
principles und ~how yon why n person magnetized cnu have• I lie ,·ision
which I now have. There is a sorl of sy lpathctlc rnng·1ct i~nl.
Where this exists in suhjecl~, they nre only portly m~q~nctiz~~d ~ the
n.ind will follow that of the operator, and go no fu1thc1'. This b
s!;mpathettr. clni rvo}nllce. l\lnny suppose tlwl 1ha rnind must ~top
here ; l>ut \'\.'ho IJut an Almighty po wt:.~r shall say, Thus far nnd ll tl
tf'nrther. My mind goes beyourl this, nnd nlso the rn in·J of l\1r. l>a vio:,
who. perhaps is now the best subject in the world. His brain never
ha~ been tampered with to gratify the idle curio,itiPs (If men. This i~
why he can see beHer than I can, but 1 sho
.ll say nothi ng e:<cepl
of that wh1ch I can see clearl v.
This nervous electricity is c-alled into action by th~ nperntion of the
will, and assists the n!ind in performiug its vnrious functiOlls ; it ac-
'(;Ompnnies the mi nd in every (light of the irnnginatinn, and assists in
t:onveying the mind to different parts of the world. This ;, the negn-
tiv(:' or coarser mind- the mind thnt man pos~essl'd hcfo re God breat h-
ed into him or through his senses the breath of lilc. This coarser
mincl or el-ectricity, dies with the body, but mnn has nn immaterinl or
positive mind which never dies, and is the breath thnt God breathed into
man when he became n. "living soul.'• Now Inde pendent Clairvoy-
~nce is whP.n the mind is not controlled by the operator. The nega-
tive mind o~ electricity o( which we have spoken is mostly extracted.
It 1enves the positive mind, which is at liberty to explore the region,
<>f unlimited space. This is a pleasnnt stnte to bo in. The po'litive
mind will always e:< i~t, becnu~e it is an integrnl part of the great First
Cause. This mind is constitutionally handed down from one genera·
tion to another,-it is imrnnterial and end les~ly pn>gressive ufter it is
entirely divested of the negative mind and the body returns to the dust
of the earth.
Thirdly-By whom were the principles known and prncticed.
Having shown you the principles of magnetism, nnd its benefite, J
now proceed to •how that human ma~netism hns always existed and
that it hru been practised from Adam do,vn to the present time. Cain
wns a magnetizer, but he used it for a bad purpose. AbelJHilcticed it.
but he WftS n good man nnd used it for better purpo~e~. Different in-
dividullls practiced it down to Nonh. Nonh wRs in an inder•endent
stale of mngnetism when be prophesied tho Flood ; hi! vision wna
7
·.eri2ct nnd he could sec luture events. lt was known hv few until tho
Jays Clf the prophets. Daniel was in a positive stnte '~hen he inter-
preted Belshazzar's dream, and told him ho was weighed in the bal-
ance and found wanting. The false prophets :mel mngicin.ns. ~ro­
ken of in the scriptures, were not in nn ~ndependent state; neithor
indeed couM they be, because their desires ,.,·ere evil. Joseph was in
a po~iti rc state when he prophesied nnd interpreted dreams. So were
many other~ from Joscph to the days of the A postlcs. Paul was in a
positive state when i.n his vision he was c~ught up to the third heav-
t>rt ~ he had a. clear view of the immaterial mind which hf' speaks of
in a wal\cful or natul'al Mate, when he says, u It ?·s sown in corncptielt,
lml 11 is rniscd in. wcorruptirm : 1t is sown ..
;,, dishonor, tt is rctisr:d itt
:_:lory; it is sawn 1·n 7.Dcakncss, it. is raiscrl ut p01cer." 'Yhere he say~
it is sown in corruption, he means it is sown in the negative mind
"hich is corruption. Her<' he has diiect reference to the positive or
:u1mnterial 111ind h:H·ing connexi0n with the negative mind in this
~.v-oJld.
A!' we ~tnce dmvn, we fin<.l that Orrin !\Jesmer wns a mngnetizer;
aud though he was some\vhat acquainted with ths principles, and might
il!lve dono much good with them, he uid not-he pretended to refer the
principles to f::omc miraculous agency co:1oected with himself, and
therefore practised deception upon the people. The principles should
never be callf'd Mesmerism : it is human magnetism. The course
which Mesmer pursued, and also the cours~ which many at the present
Jay pursue, ha""e causeJ tnany to disbelieve. The principles shoulu
r1ever be used for mere worldly gain. They are designed for good-
. ~nd are of heavenly origin, and calculated to bring n glorious reform
-JS!Jt,tot in the world.

LECTUllE I.
TnE DEtTY ot· First Great Cause, has existed without beginning c/1
days nnd without ending.
Before the earth wus formed there existed one unbounded immen6il
of space. Th's was the residence of the Great Ftrst Clluse, whos:
wisdom is unbounded, whose loYe is unbounded, and whose power i.
unbounded-unboundeu in ]o,·e because Ilis naturei:s love-unboundei,
in wisdom because His nnture is 'Ni:!dom, love, nod power. Immensi,
ty or space is unboundetl ; hence, Elis powet• and wisdom hnve crentel~
tile sun, n.nd othet· suns bcsic.lesoul's, nnd other pJnnetnry systems whicll
l'evolre around their sun. .All of these planetnry systems are sup_.
ported by positive nnd negative electricity.
Positive electricity is tHl attt•nctive power, which keeps ea~h"' planet
from striking or going off beyond its propP.t' limits from the sun.
The negnti\'e electricity hns n repulsive influence. \Vere it not
for the positi'.·e electricity, which keeps each planet in its plnce, the
negative electricity would drive them off on n tnnge(lt, and with nn
immense velocity, going nt the rate of 500,000,000 of miles in a
minute, they would be dashed against other worlus and destroy the
wnole planetary systems.
Bacl1 sun, there:fore1 by its positive nnd negative power, keeps nil
its phnet:u·y systems in motion, each ncting in l1armony \\ith the
Grea.t First Cause.
LECTURE II.
1-Ia\'ing spoken of the Great First Cnuse, whose attributes nre Love.
\Visdom and Power, I shall now proceed to givo you an. account of the
formation or the sun nnd planetary systett)C:,
'fhe Great First Cause had powet· ro spenk all things into existence
in a moment; but it \\as his nature- nnd wisdo111 to bring it about hy
progres~ion. Hence we see ~he formation of the sun was tho con1-
mencemeut of the work of progression.. 'L'he sun, arounJ which the
planetary systems revolve, is an immense body of heatJ 300,000.
times hottet· than melt~d o.re. This is composed of electricity and
beat-both posilive nnd negntive. The sun was rnore millions of yetn~

on rnillions of years rolled round in forming lhis globe-past nml fu -
ture time being pre!)ent with the Great Fir~t Cause- 1:-hus, the earth
was long progre::osing from a floating mass of fire. By the power of
rhe-aun upon this fire, which was cnntinually attracting the finer par-
ticles of electricity, in the p,.oce~ of time there bcg·1 n to be parti-
cles~ roarse sand. Thus you see in the works of progression, that
1he earth continued on till we had lund, t.nd by the power of electrici-
ty. this earth began to be one uneven mass of sand and rocks.
The works of progre~sion still-continued on, dividing the enrth, and
forming cnarser minerals nnd land.
T he coarser minerals we re fi rst formed ; such ns stone. than iron
ore, und continuing on, forming bituminous conl, lend, ::~.inc, copper,
silver, gold, &c. .
Jn the process of time~ I discover that wnter began lo accumulate on
1he earth. T his wns many million years dividing o(f. till at length we
have waters :lnd dry lnnd. These waters hnve continued to progres~.
and were formerly thicker and more like the lDead Sen, which 1 shaH
dwell upon hereafter.
Hn.ving ~thus hnstilylgiven you a brief history of the world, I shall
~ eave this ~ubjeet for y<>ur consideration until Monday evening.

his is" prngt'essive work.
A milliott of ye:H.... rolled nround before ther·c was any thing in the
hape of animal life:. ~n\': from tire vPgetntron we dis~over n dark

cend in the c:cale oi being. we uisco\'er vnrious insects which live in
shells, and various other animals mo,·e in the wotcrs of the great deep,
until we arr \'eat tire whaic, wh=ch Job refer" tu when he savs,--
" He maketh the dPep to boil lrke a pol: llo maketh the-sen like n
-pot of ointment. (Jc mnketh ·a path t•) shine ai1cr him ; one would
think the deep to be hoal'y. Upon earth there is not his like, who is made
without fear.', •
ln tracing the progre~s of these animnlq, we hnve found the
eonnecting link between animals which Ji•:e on land and those which
live in water. These nrc called amphibious animal-.-tbey would not
live witho!..!t ncces") to bBth land and water.
l will now continue the history of animals which live on land. As
we ascend, we discover n species of the Monkey r·esombling the Sloth.
slow in motion, which ne\'er improves in intellectual facu lties. And
:tscending still farther, we fi nd another species, more active, which
we call at the prcsen: day, Oura ng Outang. T hei r minds are c:escep-
tible of n small improvement. T hree millions of years have now po.ss-
~d since vegetation wns first formed.
Tho fourth dny, according to Moses, or 4.000,000 of yenrs from the
time vegetation was first formed, the specres is formed which we cnll
man. But man, like the beo.!'lSof the fie:d, is not yet suceptible of
moral improvemeut. I shall now leave tlri.; HllOJect,nnd rny next lecture
will commence withAdClm,when God breathed mto him the breath ofl ife.
LECTURE IV.
I now proceed, in the fourth lecture, tn show how God breathed mro
man the breath of ltfe, when he becamt: a l iv in~ fiOUI.
The Buok 11f Mo:tes informs us that God rested on the seventh Day
from all hia labor•. This doe11 nut imply rest, becaus• God does not
need re~t, but it impliet thnt God ceased from his work or progression in
ahe anirnal kinidom .
12 CL.-\ Ill\"OYA~T
There are now one mil11on of vcau from the time Gotl crcnted m:t:ot
till he brenthed into him tho '4
br~nth of life," during which time mnn
Ji,·ed and multiplied like bonsts. and did not progress in knowled~e unci
r<:finemenr. After this God breathed info .Adam thu breBth of life and
•• man became n living soul.':
This breath of life which God brcftlhed into him wn!J not onirnAI J:rc,
but it Wa!l an integral part or the Great First Cau'~O. This body·.
with the common mi ncJ, ~hall return unto du~t; but the brcnth ol
lifo which is the ~oul, shall Jeturn unto Gou who gnvo it. Thu~ we
see man becnmo a livin~ soul. and hncl the power given him to expnnd
his morul and iu\cllectua! faculties. .At this tirlle there wn~ a deep siPefl
brought upon him, which was something similar to what is termed n wmr.e
nt the present tirnP, and the nervoos elec:ricity or common rointll~ft him.
lie remained in this state f.lbout four days.
After he was brought hnck to hi-. natural stare, ho snw n fern ale beside
him, which he dascuvcred to on his \'>ife. A rib wns not literally ta~cn
from his ~iuc, as mnny suppose a~ the pre~enl time; uut IH! supposf'd
from t~c imprcs~ion mauu upon his rninci that it wns ]llcrally the case.
I lence he respected her, and took her ro himself for :'l \\'lfe. An im-
pre""it,n wns wrought upon Eve at the ~arne time, which mnue her know
that Adam was to be her hu::.banJ.
There were other inhnbito.nls in different pnrts that became "livinrr
0
souls'' ubout the sarr.e time. Before man becarnc a living soul, the llll-
man specit'Sl had 110 more regnrd for e:H:h other than the brute creullnn.
Now thnt they wore mauu susceptible of morn! improvemt-nl, th(.y
were placed in a pleasal"'t garden. surrounded by the beasts of the field.
.\s all the works of nature were ~overued by iaws, it w~s necessary
that mall should have a law by which to be governed.
If he had not bP.t:Hl governeJ by a law, tw would not hnvo been sus-
ceptible c1f improvent<'ll f. H.ence thl'1 cnmrnnnd was givt:n that thev
should not prti'!Cikc ofullrhe fru11 oftlw ~nrd(•n. There was a ccrtaiu t'ruit
the\' were for bidder\ to cat. This r.uit WilS no better Lhnn the rest : it
wa~ metely givon to them for n law hy which they were ro be governed.
The law g.\·eu rhcm wn:), "the <.lay thou catc:sl thereof lhuu shalL surt!ly
die.''
Th1s <lcnth did not menn n literal Jeath of rhe boJv, nor soul. It wns
a mere de:\lh to tlreir pre.:en~ ~:lase anti happine:-s. ilnd It been a l1ter<•l
denlit, they \\ uuld have tlieJ. lind It buen n ~piritual tlea1h, tho brca:h
o( God '' hich wa~ brearhtd into 1hern wuuld ha\'e uieu, thus destroying
an 111tegrnl part ot' Deity himself". Thus you see his laws cntHiOt bt..:
trnrhgrc:;~ed ,,:tholll fl\lll i-,hn•eut. By rh is the1r minds were oper.t·d.
nud they l'llW they had broken Lhe divmt commands, :llll.l tllaL Lhey were
about to sulft!r the pcoalry.
They were clriveu from thi~ ststo of happiness, and were obliged to
grt n li\·ing by the sw~:at of the brow.

LECTUnF;S, IS
LECTURE V.
1 now proccc:d with my fifth lecture according to engagemenr, to trnco
Ol&ll down from the !im~ he was driven from the Ga1 den of Edeo to the
11111U of the Deluge, having previously ~llo"·n that mnnkind -.yerc 110t
....u::ceptible of moral nnd intc llt!ctual improvement before they broke the
law by which they were to be goYen;ed. The intention of this law was
1101 that thoy should not ~lterally eat the fruit of a tree, but it was a com-
IIHllldment, giv,~n for their good; and when they were driven from
d11~ garden or place of ltapprness, they were compelled to get their livtng
lJ\ the sweat of the l>t ow.
· They we:-e unacqun1nted with any nrt nr science of cultivating the
t~anh, or of manufacturing utensils. Hence the mnnner in which they
be:>gan to cultivate the earth wns hard, and their facilities, limited.
Uy seeing ddT~rent fruits, \\ h1ch riper.cd nod fell to the ground, ~ud
seeiug them sp1 ing up n11d vf:'getate by the pa ocess which I have
:,huwn in n prevJOUli lecture, Adam saw th:.tt it was necessary tllat fruit
and grain should be cultirt.lted for his sub~istt'lJce. Herrce he went to
work with sharp stones in cultivating the soil. But he soo~ became
tired of this slow prot:ess, and began to invent tools. Here we discover
th~ first invention of uttnl!!ils for cultlvatiug the so1:.
You 'f'r'ill here permit aue to digress and meutiun, what I have prev:-
ou ly hinted, that there were other iuhal>itnnts at this time in diflerent
pu1l:s uf the country. l\los('s gives us no account of any others than
Adam and E~,·e ; neithe1· does he deny the existence of any others.-
The!·e were other inhabitan~s that received the lllqath of life and becnrne
]ivin~ souls. These also had commundanents g1ven them which they
broke, and with Adam, were drive.J from th~ir (then) present state of
ease.
In speaking of man, Mose$ selected Adam more particularly in order
that the commandments might be handed down in the mo~t condcnseci
iorm poss1ble to future generations. Hence the account dues not de~troy
the \'aliJity of ~fose~' history of the woriJ. You l-!CC that after n whJie
Ca!n was born a living soul. He purtook more of !he nature of hi~ pa·
1ents ; and hence ns he udvunced in years, he iodulgec more of the nat-
urul inclinations of h!s parenis to do evil : His broth~r Abel bt~ing horn
after thrs, wa~ tnore meek and humble; his parents had, on taking the

LECTURE VI.
linving stated, in my previous lecture, that it became necessary to
dcst:-oy man Mtd beast from the face of the earth becuuse thev hAd' be-
comt: corrupted nnd sinful, I ~ha!l now proceed to show the m~oner m
wh1ch they were de~troyed. Here we discover rhat nil the haman family
WP.re d~srrnyed but the ri~hteo'Js. Noah and his family, including h1s·
chtldren who were marri~d, nnd their famtlif's, the only nghteous one~
that then e~idted upon the face o~ the enrth, were saved.
Noah had often warned the human family that there was & storm
gathering-t!H>.t they would btt desrroyed unless they repenred ; but they
regard~d not hi~ counsel and were finally destroyvd in the flood.
I shall hP.re explain n mystery which Moses did not fully unfold 1n
his hilltory of the tlood.. .Moses- \\laS a good mar., and so far as he undl!r-
stood, he was corret:t. B1s knowledge did not extenrl over the whole
ear:h nt 1his time;· he did. n()t ~now 1he number nf the d.itfercnt kinds of
beasts that inhabited other parts of the earth. There were ml\ll)f cl'tfltr
t~nt kind::; of animtlc; de~troyed of which he does not epeak.. ft wouhJ. bo
)mpossible to g.et two of each k'md into the Ark that then ex1sted on the
ear rh. An 1mpression was made upon the mind of Noah thnt he should
build an ark, that he nnd- hi~ posterity might eacape tne Deluge which
was 'lboul co111ing upon the world. There were existmg previous to the·
Deluf!~, nboul one l1undred million beas:s nnd human bem;:!s; and Noah.
his familv, a few fowls of the air, and be11sts of the field of each kind, so
far as ~ioses knew, were saved. The benst-t nnd·fowls which.entered..
the llrk were tamed and had not been corrupted.
Now comes the Delu~e, of which Noah hnd Jon~ nn irr.pre&sion-
Variou~ opir.ions c."ist in regard to tne manner in which ~h£; ftocd came
upon the world. Some supp(}se that )l nctually raint-dJ io torrenrs for
forty days and forty nights, and some suppo~e that a comet pnssed over
the earth and uttracted the waters; o-thers cr6 of opinion that the pola~
of tht1 earth changed;. but neithe1 of these theo: ie!j nre correct. I will
now simply explain itS() that you will uB undersrnnd it by woy of eom-
P.arison. You moy tal'e n pn1l of watar and po~s it with such npidity
over vou:- head, thnt the water will not move in the puil. You mny stop
this p~il when it is bottom side up, nnd the water will immediat6ly rush
our. It was so with the en.rth, which was atopped in irs motion around
\he sus. as incred1hlc ae it moy appear to iorne.. The wote!.s immedi··
lG CL..UR \'OY.\ST
:ucly rushed (orth, nnd ra;->idly covered the face of the enr~h, destroyinr::
man, bct\st, the fowls of the air, and many o( the large animals that lhed
JR the water, swe:eping the forests and burying large trcC!s in the cnrth.
\Vhcn the motion of the earth was agatn started, the watr.ri immedi-
:ltely rushed back to their former place:,. The rush of the waters to and
fro upon the earth js what cnused so mn ny hills, valleys. rno~ntntns, and
so m!lny different sources of streams, as I shall ~how in some future
lecture.
Furt~tet· eviden~e that I have told you correct, may be found in the
fossil remains of 1argc animals buried deep in the earth. These animals
existed before the flood, and we have no history of their existence bi£Jce
thllt time. These bones will never become decomposed till rhcy are
exposed to the nir. There is an electricity which allnchcs itse If to them
and prevents their decay while zhey nre covered in tl.c earth. Large
forests, ae l lnve hinted, were swept down by the flood und covered 10
the earth, and by the process of heat caused by the electricity containeJ
in the trees when they were buried, they have becomo so far dccompo:;ed
as lo produce coni.
\Ve shall now proceed with the history of Noah, his posterity, nnd
also the anim~ls ,.,·hich were saved with him. Immediately aft~r the
tiood, we see Noah, his family anti the beasts again upon the earth, aod
the fowls in the air.
Oh! hvw snd a change! \Vould it not be well for the children of men
to take warning and 1mprove the mo raJ fuc'Jities and prevent their sudden
destruction !
\Ve see the posterity of Nonh fast increasing. They were comm:mdod
10 multiply, and replt:r.Jsh the earth; and passing over many events that
would uo interesting had 1 time to trace them out, we see the posterity
of Noah multiplying and ngain following different purE.uits-:some tra-
ding, some huoting; forming different settlements.
Among the mighty hunters, we ~ee Nimrod, spoken of by Moses.
He had become 1:1 great hunter, nod also a very wicked man-he had
become so profane u.nd wicked that his cnnscienee told him in langunge
that could not be misunderstood that he justly incurred the displeasure of
the Alinighty. H~nce he formed n plan to build an ark in which to es-
cape in the event of another flood. Ile hnd often trted to invent an ark,
of \Yhich Moses does not speak-but he finally invented a plan of build-
ing a Tower. Hence there was a tax laid upon the inhabitant~ forma-
king bricks. These bricks were made in a dtfferent mauoer from those
of the present day. They comm~nced a grer.t building, covering two
acres of ground, and were making great progress, when we see another
interpoiition of Divine Providence. Ilera we dee their language con-
founded, and they were in confusion n!ld consternation. They aban-
doned the rroject and passed into J.ffurent parts of tile earth, forming
ditferent nations and dinerent languages.
I will now pass to the close of tlll!s lecture by n brief remark on the
animals which left rhe nrk. From them sprung the different animala
which inhabit the enrth al the pre:sent day. Climate, nmalgamntion, &c.
are the cnuies of the different species which exi~t al the present time.

LECTURE Vll.
I shall continue on "'ith the hislorv of mnn from the time the Ian·
~nage was confounded down to ~lle rl"cs:ruction of Sodom.
\Vhen the langJnge was c0nfounded, you recollect I said all was
<:on~ternutiun nud amazement. No two coulci u11derstand each
other except families. They necessarily separated and went inta
<.litfercnt parts of the earth; some wenL East-some went \Vest-some
''en t North and other~ went South. At this time they were all of one
blood and of rather a swarthy or copper complexiotll.
<Toing in different clitnates from warm to cold and from extreme
heat to e~trcmc cold, reason will show us at once, would entirely
c hange the blood nnJ complexion. At once therefore, we discover
why there are different nations, different languages nnd people ofdif-
ferent l>lood.
I will now turn to the family wlJich went Northward forming dil-
ferlimt settlements, multiplying and replenishing the earth.. But you
will perceh·e 'that in ~assing along with my lecture, I must necessarily
]ea\'e many thing~ interesting which I have not time \O dwell upon..
ln tracing this Compa:ty which went north, '-Ve SOGn Ui5COVel' thnt they
pn:ss along Bhering.,s straits inte North America. They cros:sed upon
a narrow neck of 1ce. These s;raits have since been widened !Jy the
current of water. Before the flood thev were com;·ected L>v land.
)[ow \\'e see ~he \Vest{}rn Continent-settled for the first time ai·\er the
flood.
1\Iany centuries ha,·e pa~sed awny since this was settled after the
Deluge. \Ve see this company still passing on, fol'lninl! larger set-
tlements, building cities anJ forts, the remains of many ofwhi·ch, nre
plain to be seen ot the present day.
\\'e see those settlements ofte1'l at war with eae:1 other, tho stronger
overpowering the weaker, one driving the other further away until we
find ~outh America settled.
These companies !Juilt Forts as they pr,ssed along .; an~ as th-ey were
dri\·en from these oy their enemies. the"e forts were enJMged f\f1d
$trengthened. At ia~t these in turn were overpowered and taken uy
three ofot~rc lo~t tribes ofIsrael. which {shall dwell upon more partie·
~arh: in a future lecture.
P.ermit me to turn vour attention back to tha iower of Babel, nnd
trace clown the hbtory of other individuals: \Ve see some :!ZOing
south fllllowing \larious pursu1ts,- some hunting,--~oane cultiv::.ting the
f'Oi \,- some wor·king in metals,-and others building ves~t:ls with
which to navigate the wnter.
I c:J.nnot follow each family down separately--time will not permit.
f de~ign to follow Abraham nnd Lot. with whose histories the humnu
fnmily ure especially concerned. \Ve see Abrnham and Lot, about
seven centuril'!s after· the Deluge, traveling with their t}ocks together
until they come to a large plain. Here they formed a setl]ement und
lived until the1r senants got contending about their he..ds. Here we
18 C!..AfR\'OX.\~T
~ce, notwitLstandwg all the wrongs they bod been punishc~ for,_ they
were yet inclined to do e\·il, contending, fighting :.ml stenhng, ttll nt
last Abraham proposl·s to Lot that they separute; that the• e '"·ns roonl
enough without J!ving in contention. Auraharn was more penccnblr:t
tlwn Lot, he hn\'iug more positive mind, as he pnrtook more of the
JHliUI'C or Noah thnll anv of his descendants. \Ve follow Lot aloug
tili ot la:~t he is settled inn city.
Here we sec thot the inhabitants had given themselves up to al!
manner of wickedness. It became necel:>sary to de::~troy them; :tnd
here we &ee ngnin that the wicked cauoot escnpe punishtuent; the
timo had tHrived for the des!ruction of the city; Lot wus warned to
escnpc by two good meu whom he supposed were angels. These mer.
were the descendants of Abtabam nnd had rhe power of pi'Ophecy.
Lot warued hi~ wife and family to e!'cnpe with hirn; they would not
go, but his wife started. She, disbclie\ tng, ~topped to return, and here
wo discover she died. She was in a certain state of atrnusphcrP. which
pet ritied he... She diu f ot Inerally become a pillnr of 1mlt. There
~ho remained for a long time.
IJtHe we see that mony lnfidf'l~ are maJe '>0 t},i:; point of scripture,
lJelicving it impossible for not Gnly Lor's wife to tum into a pillar of
~mit, but fur fire and brim.,tone to rain t!own from hel.lven ; l>ut let u:;
for a moment look nt thi::t sulJject. Here we see large quantities of
brimstone nnd sulphur ; many dtalt in the article ; and the springs
were '\"ery ::tulphur;ous. Yon see it wns in the extreme la':lt of sum-
~r. \V e see this toolc fire by the rnys of heat frorn the sun, as the
ciry was filled witl1 combustible matter, and almost instantly we see the
city '"Min Oames. This took place about 12 o'clock, about the 15th
day <?f the 5Th month, answering to July. This wns the lOth Century
l't·onl the time of the flood. Tho city pre3ented the aprenrrnce of fire
auJ brimstone ruining dawn from heaven, ns seen uy Lot on the hill.
Tuming your nllention to the promibe given 1o Abrnhnrn, we see
thut in him nt:d in his seed should all rite natiohs and kindred~ of the
c>i\rth be blesset.l. 'fhe:::.e promises have stood, which l shall show in a
future lecture. Though all the powers of wicked men combined ~hould
try to O\'Crthrnw them. :hey nre promi..;e~ on which we may rely. I
have onty to state. in this lecture, that the historv of Sodom was

ham's ndvanc~d ngc, should be blessed with children. But when wo
consider the ~hysical constitution of man at that day and age of the world,
that they lived nt an advanced nge-some five, some s~x, some eight,
and others near ten hundred years of age, it is not t<> be wondered tnnt
Abraham should be favored with children whren he w~s one <>-r two hun-
tired y<?nr~ old. Man's life has been sh.ortrme.cfi b.y broal<ing phy~icnl
nnd mora! laws, as I shall show in some future l~cru.re. But thero ure
here, rnuny things which l must necessarily pass 0ver r"or want of time
nnci hasten on to the ~irth of Isaac :ind show anorh ~r fulfilment of pro-
phecy. Here we discover the peculiar state of ilJ.i~:Hl Abraham was 1n
when he thought he was required to offert up Isaac a$ an offering to God.
Moses S\lpposes that it wus a vo.ice from God wl1ich Abraham heard
when he was irnp:-essec; with the idea Q[ Qfferiog up Isaac as an otferrng.
Abraham accoruingly took Isaac ard started wi~h him to a mountain.
'When he arrived at tile mountain, lsn.nc did no: know Abraham's in-
\eotion of offering him up as a burnt offering. After 1he Wtlod was nil
prepared and everything was ready, Isaac asked his father wb.ut rhc of-
fering was. Abraham still laboring undeit-the sn.me impression, told him
tltat God would prepare an niThrin~. Here you s.t•e he bouJHl Isaac, aud
as he ro1scd h1s knife to slay him,Ab!la•ha.m's..n.ttenlion was arrested by a
noise in the l.m~hes near by ; and ~re the impres~1on tnl:iJt lsaac wu~ 10
be offe1·ed left l1irn. Abr::lham then di~o\(ered a large mm thnt \v:tS
c.:otan~led in a thicl<et of bushes se that he,could not gtf awny, a.nd Aurn-
ham offered hitn instead of l:.a~.
Now Abraham was laboring under a high stare oi nerveus excitability,
and in his drealll, his mind being seemingly diseased1
, he got the impres-
ston th:H God requir~d him to.offer up hrs O\\ n son a sacrifi~a. But
n ·od did not requ1re thi3 sacr1f.ce. to be made, as Abraham and M·oscs
supposed. 13ut as Abraham hnd,his.. miu.d t•hus excited with 1he imp.res-
sion re~uhing from whnt I have just stated, and•his profound rcvt'rence
f(,r God and nn unbounded fnith ID His dealings with men, it was no.pro-
vidence in procuri·ng Isaac for an offering: but it was a providen.ce· in
A~raham's tak tog isaac to the mountain where the rum was entangled;

1 shall now proceed with the history uf Abraham, with which the
human family aru so deeply interested. The !lromise thut was given to
)urn I have alreauy mentionl3d, and have show.1 how h•c was preser-
ved.
1 shnll now pnss over mnny things of interest nnd profit and come
immediately to the birth of Jacob and Esnu, who IVero :he sons ot Isaac.
Jacob ar.d £-;au are spol<en of as the heads of two nations where It is
said, "E~au have I hated, and Jncob have l loved.'' This pr0p!\ecy,
us I have just hulled, WU8 in a national roJnL of view . '.LJ acing the
history of Esau and Jo.cob we see Esau selling his l>irth·right, ju~<t as we
Slec m~ny at the present dny, to sattsfy \heia· evil proper;sitics. Here we
sec the manner in which Jacob got the !:>lrs;;ing ins~ead of E.sa.u. Now
I must neces~nrily letwe the h1story of Esau and trace that of Jacob.
\Vc see Jacob traveling east of Cana~n-night overtakes- him, and he
bvs in the open field. \Vhllst the dews of ben\'<'n were fai!Jng upon
lai;n, he lmd a visinn. In this vision the promise nanin appeared to him,
tlrat in him and his sf!ed should all the IHl.tior!l> of the earth be bless<!d,
and that his seed shollltl be multiplied as the sau<ls upon the sen shore.
In tracing this history duwn, we see this prorn1so was fulfilled. I must
uow pass ov:er the history t>f his marriage, whioh an1 one can.lrarn by
CL.\fRVOYA~T
reference to Moses' history. I must pass along till nftcr tile llilth of his
ten children. Many of them practised bad habits; they were given to
lyiug, stcnlin~ and contention among themselves ar.d other~. Joseph
uas more rnild and meek-he wns kind and affectionate to hi,; pnrcnrs,
to his brothers llnd to nil around him. He was so kind nnd nffcctionnta
to his parents that they p\aced much confidence in him. lli'i fat!.cr low:d
h1t11 wllh all the nllachment and affection of a tender purnnt; and his
brethren envied and hated him. Being young he wus ncr.cssurily urH.lor
his father's eye. He was often sent with errands, while his o!dcr breth-
ren were 10 the field talt:ng care Gf herds. Now Joseph was possessed
With the spirit of prophecy on account of his having so much more of the
positive mind than the rest. You see thn manner in which he rehued
his dream to h1s brethren when he dreamed thoy were in tho field binding
shenves i thei~ sheaves mnde oueisancc to Ius, and whr 11 he toid his
Lrethren of this dream they envied hi:n nnd laid plan5 to tnke his life.
And when he dreamed the sun, moon and t:leven stnr s maue obei·
snnce to him, they envied him ;be more. They suppo::>ed that he '' ns
uc::piring to be their 1uler, and they iaid plnns to destroy him; and dlCy
fell upon hirn and beot him wi1h clubs. They supposed they had killeu
him, and they threw Ja;m in a d1tc~:. They then killed a kid and tore
~nd blooded hib coat and sent ouo of their number with the coat to his
father to excuse themselves, adding sin to transgres-;ions. "\\'hile one
of the•n was gone wrth the coat the rest left him in the ditch. One of the
number returning again, saw signs of returning life, and called the rest
to l<now what should be dor.e with him. By this time he had so for re.
eovered t~at he was able to stand up. \Vl11le they were dcv1s1ng means
to make wa.'f· \\ ith h1m, they sllw a company of Egyptians who had heE'n
out on a trading rxpedaion and were return1ng. They solo Joseph to
this company, and he was curried inro Egypt.
Bore let me tum your attention ro Jacob. IIa mourned and could
not be comforted. On Joseph he relied for support in old age, because
Joseph was so kind 10 him, but still his confidence was unshaken in the
promrses. [Jere 1 shall dwell more particularly upon this subject, be.
cau~c Jo.;cph was a type of the prombe.d Messiah which was to come.
Now I must follow Joseph into Egypt: After a while we see him cast
into prison, of "hich Moses has spoken. But he received much i!l trear_
went not mentioned bv ~\lnses. At one time he was c:ast into a loathe-
some ctll. He was c.ondemned to remain here for life : no rays of light
penetrated hi~ cell; and h~ had no friend to administer to his wants.-
He remained in th1s dark ana drsmal cell for nearly one year, when he
\\'U~ removed. In nJI this, he did not complain; his confidence was un.
f-hnken in God-he believed that he would yet see his father and his
br~thren.
Tlw manner in which he was delivered from the prison, I will no1\'
tell. 1\foses ~poke of two individuals being cast into prison about this
time. The:je men hnd dreams, and Joseph intcq rctcd the dreams in
pr:soa: : one was to be liberated rn three days, and the orhcr was ro be
executed. This did !nerally take place-one wns liberated nnd the oLhtr
was executed.
LECTURES. 23
'Passing now to the history of Pharaoh the King, who mled tho;, Ell'yp-
\Jans at this lima, wa see that he too had a dream. o
"And it came to pass, a: the end of two full yean•, that Pharao'b
~reamed; {lnd, hehold, he stood by :h~ river. And, behold, there came
up out o( the river seven well favored kine, ~nd fat-fleshed; untl they
fed in a meadow. :And, behold, seven other l.:ine came up uftel' them
QUt of the river, i:l.fuvored and•lean-Aesh~d, and stood bv the other l<ine,
upon the brit.k of the river. And the til-favored and lean·fleshed kme
dtd eat up the well-fa\'OI'ed and fat kine. sl) Phar•oh awoke. And he
slept and tlreamed the second lime: QRd. behold, seven ears of corn
~arne up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold, seven thin -ears.
and bbsted with the east w111d, -sprung up after them. And the s~ven
~hm ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awol<e,
aod. behold, it was a dream-"'-GE:sEsrs, XLJ: l-7.
This dream troubled him much. He sent for all the marricinns
1::1
1hrouglwut all the land of E,!!ypt, to interpret h1s dream. Tht.., they
could not do. Those mng1cian;; were false prophCis; they prefended
to do m1racles and deceived m1ny people; they practi~ed the arl of leg-
-erdemain, and made many thmgs appear real which was nothing but
their own deceptions and the works of their own h11nds.
He~e you see th:1t Pharaoh was still trOl1bled. His m:nd was lll{e the
troubied waters that cast up mire and dll't because of his wickednPss.-
He finally sent (or Joseph to Interpret h1s dream. Joseph interpmted 1t
by tellmg that there wa-> to b!} seven your'S of plenty and seven years of
famine. On account of th1s we see Joseph gains fiwor with Pharnoll
and JS immediately liberated from prison. when at length we se-e him
ruler over nllthc household of Pharaoh and the Janel of Egypt. He does
not once ahuse the pm•rer that 1s .grven him; still retains that peaceful
m1nd, Jool<ing forwal'd to !he day when he wo1dd see his father, nod aII
his brethren, whom he yet loves,-anoth~r type of our sasiour, showing
that he loved his brethren who supposed they hnd destroyed him; still
providtng for their wants and giv1~g them time to cornu unto him.
Here we see Joseph layin~ up provisions during the seven yea rs of
plenty throughout Egypt, preparing for the seven yenr~ of fnminc, till
nt length we see a fam10e raging throughout all the different countries,
with a plenty ir. Egypt, the provrsion that Joseph had made.
Hero we see, h:.td it not been for the preservation of Joseph, all tlle
nations of the earth would again have been c11t off. Here again we see
n beautrful type of our savrour. JosPph's brethren supposed thht they
hnd slain him, but he lived to be their s~vtour. The Jews supposed that
ti.ev· hnu sl<\in the Savionr, but he still lived, and wrll coollnue to Jive
until all the nations of the cai'Lh are freed from sin.
At length we seo Jo:oeph's brethren coming to bim to buy 9rovisions.
He knew them but did not let himsel( be known unto them ; he accuses
them of being spies; and we see them bowing do\vn ~o him, pleading
t~1eir innocence, fulfilling hi! dream reo;pecting the sheaves of wheat.-
See with whcll earnestness he inquires for his iather, the old man. \Ve
~ee hii bre.t.hretl tormented on account of their?Ins-proving that i ia

CJUlnot go unpunished, till at last Joseph rE:tains one of tiwir number and
sends the :est back lo Cannan ler.len with provisions.
Now tur»ing your attention to Jacob for a momenr, wt: see thot wher1
they return with the provisions the old man mourns the loss. of Joseph ond
another beloved son. He tells them it will brin~ h1s grey huirs with sor-.
ruw to the grave. \Ve see them ngain compe!Jeu to rmurn for provision:~,
und they go into the presence of J,o~eph, who does not yet muke h1mself
1-.nown unto them. He ioo.ds them down with provisions, orders tiH~
n1oney to be put In each of their sacks, and plnces a silver cup in the
sack of the J ounger brother; and while they are journeyiug to\varJs.
Cn.nnnn,Joseph semis n :nessenger afte1· them with orders to sourch their
sacks, commencing with the oldest ond :ifHHchiug down to the youngest,
and nl:,o with orders to bring the person back in whoso possr.::,sion th~
sdvur cup shou!d be found. \Vhen the silver cup wus found with thu
)'otmgcst, they wcro ().bout to take him buck, nntl here we ~ec the IJrothers
of Jasc~h are agn!n troubled on account of the1r patit transgression~, and
supposed it a pur,i~hment sent upou tbem for the murder of their brother.
\V ith sorrO\\ful hearts they all returned to .Joseph. Here we have a sol-
emn season; they llil bow before Joseph and pleatl tlleir innocence,s~ill
feeling guilty for their past olfcmces. They 1efcr him to their father;
tney told that they hatl had a brother Joseph who was tlcud ; they sn;d
unto him that if their younge::;t brother were reto.int:d, their father couid
not survtve the shock which it would produce upon his mind. \rhat a

Now here pet·mit mr. ognin to return to 1hc promised 1\fessinh~ this
being a type of him. He was a brother to the Jc·l\'3. They suprosed
they hnd murdered him, but ht! is yet providing for their wnnts, spiritually
-and he will not let himself be known to them all, until the Ja:st one is
brought in-he will yet be !heir deliverer, as ~ shall show in some fu..

unttl they were all gathered around him--thus showing that ~in cannot
go unpunished, and that God over rules in tlaa counsel~ CJf hi~ own wi.;.
dom. Here Joseph let:s his brethren be known unto I)harnoh, who im-
mediately invites Jos:.•ph to send for all the family of Jacob that lhey mn.y
dwell in the land \>f Egypt.
Ir. passing n1ong, we sec them all arrivP.d in Egypt, being seventy in
numuer, and aguin we have an affecting scene. the 1ncotiu" of Joseph
and his farher. Joseph's fa1her receives him with foou cn~oraces · he

lu pa:;sing along we see that Jacob die11 and was buried by J:oscph.\V.ith

eli& fathers ~A the {:md orCanaan. But I IDU!t pau over thia pleasant,
:thou~h atfeC'tir.g scene, to a further history of the natien.
'\-V'e see tlrem mult1plying in the land of Egypt, not intermarrying with
1he Egyptr3n9. But at last a decree had gone forih, 1hat every male
.ch!ld should be destroJed; many were thrown into the river. About
this time Moses was born, of whom, also, 1 shall speak in a special man-
ner; for in ~im is another rype of our saviour. This type represent9
the docree given out by Herod, in order to destroy our saviour; but he
wns rreserved to be the Deliverer of the wodd, of mankind ; whil:st
Mo•:es was saved to be the deliverer of the Israelites.
The mother of Moses placed him in a tight basket matle out of a sort
of w1llow which would not sink in the water, and left him where he was
found by Pharaoh's daughter. \Yhen she went to find a nurse to tnke
care of the cl1ild, she t'ou nd his own mother ! How affecting to have her
own son restored to her arms! llut notwithstanding this nation contin-
ued to multiply till they became so numerous that they were about to be
delivered from bondage, the Egyptians still continued to oppress them and
place heavy burd~n.s upon them which they could not bear. At length
they were compelled to gather up their strnw and make bricks, when wo
seft Moses pleading with Pharn~.>h to let tfwm go out CJf the lnnd. Now
Pharaoh was a wickeJ king, and it seems thn.t the'time had ·about arrived
for th'e Egyptian'i to be destroyed oo account of their wickedness;. it
seems a!su that Phara:lh \vas ra1sed up for the very purpose of destroying
the Egyptian nation, on account of theit· wicked inciuigences; showing
that nation~. through the dispensations of P1·ovidence are liable to be
swept from the earth. \Ve see Pharaoh often promising to let the Israel-
ites ~o,. nnd as often refuse.;;, till we see the plague sent upon the nation :
ille 11rst born throughout all the lar.d of Egyrt are destroyed in one nigtn,.
but the Israelites were saved. The sprinkling of the doorposts of tiH~·
Israelites with blood which Moses speaks of, is n figurative rP.prosentntion
of our Saviour that was to be crucified. 'l'his blood, therefore, was not
l!:erally sprinkled upon the doo1 posts.
LECTURE XI.
I shall still continue the· history of the ChilJren of Israel. on thoir
journey from the land of Egypt to the lam! of <i!anaan.
\Yhen brael went into the land of Egypt there were but seventy
per~on:s young and old. After remaining n long:. time in lJondagc, a·s
1 hU\'C shown you, they started rrom the laud of Bgypt,. bein:,r a large
Com pan}', and number over tweh·e hundred thou~mnd, JOUng anJ old ;
bul i\Io es mentioned GOO,OOO men on fuot.
J\Ioses being the leucle1·, they follow his direction and Iert the land
of Egypt. From the time Joseph was sold to Egypt till the time they
left \\:1:3 500 years.
26 CL.\lRVOY.\NT
On aeaving this country, 1hey borrowed all tho gold they coultl,
from \he Egyptian women. This was done in order to destroy the
Egyptian uation ns we shall ·presently ·see. ffhey wero n short way
ou their journey to the )and·of 'Cannan, when we see Phnr<toh, with a
large army, ~ursuing them to bring them back ngain into bondage,
after he1
had once let them ~o. \Ve follow them on their journey only
t\ short way, when we see them ·corr.p)aining nnd murmuring. 'J'hey
were sooo in a suflering c~ndition fcrr want of pro\'ision. i\1oses gives
an account of manna being rained down from hea.Yen for them. This
manna wns som<.>thing similar to honey dews which we hu.ve nt the
present 'dny, but it -was in a much greater c.bundanco.
They continued along until we see them in a land where there is
~n nbundnnce of Huails, with which they are supplied, uut still we see
1hem cont!nu:.1.lly murmuring and complaining.
The pillar of fire' by night and the cloud ofsmoke by day, by which
they were guided, wns not literal. The pillar of tlre wn" a
'ngurative representation of the Savior, the promi~ed l\!cssiah. The
cloud of Sllloke was !l figurative rcprcscnttltion that they Were to ue
de)i..·ered from the:Egyptians.
In pasoing still further we find them at lfmgth complaining for water.
I will here mention the Rock, which !\loses smote when tha water
gushed forth. This rock was a large slate stone, frotn which a spring
runs nt the present day. :Moses broke off a piece of this rock anJ
found an abund:tnce of water, for th~ir supply. As they pass along
we ::iee thfly are aguin complaining. At leng1h they arrive at tho Ret!
Sen. Here they !lave the Red Sea in front, with hills 011 either S'ide.
and in theit· rear the Egyptian army, so thalit was impos~ible for them
to retrent. And here it wouiJ appent thnt thry were to be t:tken. But
Mo~es' confidence was great; and as he viewcd the Hcu Sea, he saw
tr.e wnters were reced~ng. This was near tl1e shore-a <.ltstnnce ot'
about two miles. The tide pas~ing bach, 1\loses and his compnny
pnSied through, nnd he supposPd that he cnu:;ed lhe ·wnlers lo recede.
They arrived safe through on the opposite side; Phnl'noh nnd his
company followed in the rear. Th~re were many stones and rock~
here ; and in their.passnge, the wheels to the chariots iJelonging to
Pharaoh's army were broker}, and the army was consequen1ly delayed;
and when the tide returned with a strong ·wind, they could not make
their escape, and thewaters rushed back upon them very suddenly and
overwhelmed them in a watery grave. Here .Moses looked back and
FI\W them dri\•en to the shore, nnd destroyed, and tho company were
.gr·eatly rf'joiced ::t being again delivered from the Egyptin:ls.
fn pnsstng along with the company, we see l\Iuses le:.tving them and
·going to the 1'rtountain to write the Law which was hande<.l down uy
them to succeeding generations. Here in this Mountn:n l\loses had a
Trnnce; and in his trance the Law was plain to his mind; nnd after
coming out ofttliis trance·he wrote the Lnw in hieroglyphics, with his
L
ft-nger, on a parchment of goat skin, which be had prepared.
.Heturning to the company, with the .Lnw or Commundmcnts under
LECTURES. 27
his arm, he found that the childreu of lsrnel had made· golden images
and were gone to worship them. Here \\'e seo Moses w·as angry nnd
sinned, by destroying the commandments.
He finally returns to the mountain and has another vision, which
wns not ns perfect as the first, nnd after writing the commandments, he
returned to the company.
These commandments were kPpt, nnd he proceeded with the com-
pnny. In following them along, they were often afflicted on account
of their sins. Many died with various disenses, until we find them
among the fiery serpents spoken of by Moses. These fiery serpents
were stings of consci~nce, 0f which many died. The brazen serpPnt,
upon which they looked and were healetl is a. figurative representation
oC out· Savior. All \\<'ho look upon him and believe are sa\'ed from
these &tings of consc'ence. Still pursuing them nlong, we see them
lost in a wilderness of sin and unbelief, till al last I\-lo8ecs d1es. He
had become so imperfect und took so mnl!h pr<;ise upon himself, he
wos not permitted to puc;s intu the promiseJ land. This nccount ;s
handed dow!\ as though it hnd beeu written by ~1ose~, but it wns writleo
by Joshua.
ln passing along, we see the com;mny arrive at the river Jordan.
LECTURE XII.
In this Lecture I shall continue the history of the children of Israel
across the river Jordan ~o the land of Canaan. And here permit mo
to digress fmm the main subject, to mention that I nm placed in rather
cl'iticnl and delicnte circumstances. These lectures are to be pub-
lished to the worid. There is yet much opposilion to the principles of
Clairvoyance, especially by rnnny professetl followers of our Savior.
They ignorantly fear that it will overthrow their paT!Iculnr creeds.
l\Iany things, wh1ch I have mentioned, and will mention h£>reafter,
that have not been handed down by Moses, as llistory, !hey wi!l deny.
Many dnrk a.1d mysterious passages which hnve been translated, I sllall
make plain, adding the rea'ions tor my conclusions. Those dark :lllJ
mysterious passnges hnve mnde many infidels in our world. but the
time is fast approaching when nil men ~hnll see aliJ,e. Mr. Davi!'l, of
New York, wdl be the means ofassisting m bring1ug this great reform
about. He is engaged io the same cause ir. which I am now engnged.
in bringing about a great reformation in the world. And nhhough we
are many miles separated in our uatuJ·al state, and have ne,•et· hnd any
communication Nilh each other, when we are buth speaking upon the
same part, our statements, (except in rt>ckoning dates,) will in no wi!;e
come iu collision with ettch other.
J will now turn your allen(\ion ·to ·the children of Jsrocl at the riH~r
Jordnn where I left them last evening. Moses' history informs u~
CLAU:YOTA~T
that the wnters were divided ond set back. The mnnncr in which
they cros~cd is plain to my vision. The bible history informs us th:lt
the Israelites remained here three days before they could cross the
riYer. This was a longer period occording to the moue ol· recko11ing
timo at the present day. The period of time which they reronined
here was three years, during which time they cultivated the soil to
sorr.e extent. They orten hnd views of the inhabitants on tho other
side of the river. Before crossing over, they bniFt n monument of
stono; some or the history by Mose.--J W!l~ left in the monument. Du-
ring the period they were here, they were applyirl% 'means by which
to cross the .:;trcam. During the first two ycnr::i or which time. the
wo.tet· continued high and filled the river to the top of the bnnks. Thi::~
high wnter or flood drove all the wild beasts from this portion of !he
country. Thi> year tiH~Y sowed an ubundnncc of rico,-tl1e uext year
they had an ubuncbnt harvest. The third year they had a very dry
~ca::,on, and the waters fdl uncommonly low. The boltom of rhs river
wa~ rocky-n lenge of roc:ks lay in the bottom of the river nntl exten.
dell across the stream. 'Vhile the children were remaining bert::, :he
waters foil very SlH.iden}y and passed through a fissure in the ledge of
rocks. leaving the top of the rocl\s dry. lt \Vas on this rock, they
crossed the river ; nnd here on these ro~ks t11cy built n monument in
lllemory ol' their passage over the stream, which run under 1he rock.
\\'hen the river again arose, it swept the monument away, which is
not to ue seen the prescnL time. r\fler the children had passed
0\'Cl', they raised a llJOOUlllent in memory of the Twci\'C Tribes or
brncl. This monurnent was raised in a round or circular form, nbout
10 Ceet high: aud on the top of this monument there were 1~ l1P-wn
stonc:s mi:led iu equ:.1l distance from ench other. On cttch stone was
engraved the hrad o{' each triue j and UOUCl' each one Wi.IS engraved
the nnmr or the one represented by the cngr:lYing. \Vhilc re111::1ining
here fo1· about two years from the time they cm:-sctl the rivet, for the
JlUrpo~e of ere~ting the monument and engraviug the heads and nomes
ou the ~toucs, they rnised some c0110 and sonse rice on which they
li\·cd, nnd many or the childt·en died with V~ll'ious clbensc3. During
t!Ji..., time the nations were pt·eptni·ng' to defend themselves ngninst the

LECTURES.
-ch\1Jr~n of Isr~el hacl surrounded the walla, they commenc4ld the siege
which ~asted seven vears. .
I will here explain the reason why it is that it was termed seven days.
nnd &.1
lso why the bible spen1ts of the children oflsrael being only three
tdnys al the ri\'er Jordan. Those who wrote the account, had charac-
~ers by which lhey expressed numbers. The trnusla!ors did not fully
understand the nunber of these characters. Some of these chnrncters
expressed days; others denoted months und others indicnted years, and
thi.-; is where the error originates. Thev nlso had characters tlenotinu
• 0
centuries, and these were often translated cays. A million ofyenrs i:J
also tnmslateu a day in !\loses' history of the world. 1 hope you willnot
consider me \ isionary for gi\'ing you this explanation, for it appearli
.plain to my visiun: lT Mt:ST BE FOUND '1'0 .AI;REE WITH GEOLOGY.
After continuing this siege for about seven years, wearing out several
batlering machines and building new ones, the walls at last fell before-
the powerful machines. The bible informs us the walls fell down the
seventh tiny, by sounding the ram's horns nnd by shouting. This is a.
mistake in the translation. These walls coeld not have fallen by the
bounding of these horns, or by these shou:s, nor was it done by on
€llrthquake. If it hiiu been translated rigln, it 1VOuld rea<J, the walls
were battered to the ground aP.d fell.
About 100,000, young and old, male ana female, fell into the hand~
of Joshua and his soldiers; and a cruel scene 1mmeuiately after this
took place ; no age. no sex, nor conditien was saved from the :sword-
of the Israelites. Nona were saved but Rahab, the harlot, her father
and household. This young woman was beautiful and attracted the
attention of Joshua. Every beast7 and every domestic animal which
they took, was Immediately put to death and the entire city was des-
t:-oyed. Many suppese it wns a command from God to infltct all these
cruelties., It does not so appc~1· to me.
\Ve see the Israelites nre still a cruel and barbarous natioJJ., not,,ith-·
slanding their escape from the land of Egypt-they were reauy to•
infiict all the cruelties upon those who happened ro fnll into their
power that they had infiicted upon themsE-lves in tbe land of Egypt.
In continuing their history along, we find them Jurin·g one entire·
century engaged in war; in this war they are generally successful :·
the males were trained to war very young ; and often the female3 are
engaged in deadly conflic!s. They lived during this periotl on the
~poils which they took from their enemies. \V e onen see them with
their engines. with thci r S\'r'ords and their clubs in hand, rush into :tn<1
engage iu d~adJy combat, putting forth a hiueous noise anu destroying
each other hand to hand; and all that have the misfortune to fall in!'Qo
their power, r\either young nor old, and no sex is spared, or regarded ;
and yet this history is handed down to us, ns though it were the com-
mand of God to treat their enemies rhus cruelly. That they did thus
tren't them. is literally true-the hnlf hns ncYer been rol<.l; but Go:l
ne,·er comm:.nded them to trea~ their enemies with cruelty. lt W1\~
a mistake in the translation. In u few cnses only do they sa~~ nnl'

from a cruel nnd unrelenting death. A few of the most beautifui
femules were sal'ed to gratify their own propensities.
Ai we pass alona, we find them at war with Ai, and :\lso with firn
kings who waged ~ar upon the Gibeonitcs for submitting to the lsrncl-
Ites. Tbe Giteonitea were pl'otected. At length we &ee the fhe
kings Hee to d cavern in a ledge of rocks in the side 11111, with matly
of their subjects; anrl here they hid themselves. Thi~ wns a retrea·
:
well known to the l<ing~ nnd many others. They had a large 1Jat
stone, by which to stop themselves in, nnd hide themselves from the
enemy. But they were discovered. After tlae battle they were tal\en
and curried to the plo.ce of their execution by the order of Joshua.-
1n the first place they were taken <1nd laid upon the ground. llere
the Israelites attempted to chol<e them to death with theit· fee\. Not
succeeding in this, they hung the five kings up by their necks with
ropes made of raw bide; and thus they put them to death.
I would 1iko now to explain the sun and moon standing still while
Joshua fought jn one of the most hnrd nnd severe battles the children
of Israel haLl en•r engaged in. Some suppose the sun nnd moon ac-
tually stood still. but this wos not the case; some Sll?pose tbat the earth
was stopped in i1
s motion which kept the earth in the same position t.o
the sun. If lhis hnd taken place, the waters would then have rushed
over and <.:o' ered the whole face of the earth, as they uid nt the time
of tho llootl. This battle hsted till near night, when the enemy w.ts
defeated and Joshua gained the battle. 'fhe bible does nol teach uo:
that the sun stood still. But many rP.nd it thus, Joshua said unto the
sun stand thou still ; but it does not read so. It rends thus : "T.hen
spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the
Amorites before the children of Israel, and he snid in the sight of hra-
el, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou Moon, in the valley ol
Ajalon." It had no n•~tllling and no reference :o o1.1r sun and moon.
The bible tells us that God is our sun which gives us light ~nd sustains
us and ia our shield; while the moon represented the go~terr.ment with
which jo::;hua was at war. Notwithstanding the scenes and cruelties
Joshua passed through, he often prnyecl and wils lhe mm;t moral man
of the whole company-he could not always control his soldieJ'M wl1iclt
he did not often t1y to do. This ba!lle hta cn.me very n<"at· loosing--he
saw, if they fell into the hands of the enemy, they would all be put to
dPath. Hence his p1·ayor :o the Lord, "Sun st~llld thou still.'' 11 is
inten:ions were, as I have hinted, that the enemv shoulrl n&t be victori-
nus and that the bnttle should cease. Ilcre I ~1ight continue the his..
tory nt~d fiJI many largo \'olumes, but permit me now to turn your
minds for n few momeu!s nnu make some reflections.

Their constitutions were such that their pby.sical wants were.to hare been
supplied ; they went to inhabit ami posse~s the whole earth in time;
other nations that had broken the laws of God were to be destroyed :
nnd the temporal wants of the children of lsrnel were to, be suppiied;
but the commands given them wcne broken, nnd the curses which were
set before the1n have followed them\
They wandered in the wilderness a much longer per.iod than we un-
derstand by. rending 1\loses' history. Strange as it may appear, they
wam.le1 ed about 400 years without :s nome, exposed to aU the seasons
of the 'ear; the scorching heat of the sun in the summe;, nnd. to the
cold and chllling rains of winter. .1\lany were literally starvf\d to dea;h;

LECTUR ffi XIU.
Having shown that the-children of Israel were pu 1ished for their
sins, and that sin cannot go unpunisi1ed, [ must pass over many events
in the history ot the human family, to notice some o\her things ia
their hi:story that are interesting allll profitable, though they may ap-
pear to some mysterious. And here it will be necessary to read the
~8th chap~er of Deuteronomy. In order to see the blessings and
curses that arc set before them.as a nation by Mos3s, I shall necessa-
rily refer to this chapter in my present as well as future lectures.
In tracing the history, it appears that they often break the com...
maodments, and the curses tbreatened have followed them to the
present dny.
On arriviug at the land of Cannan. we see they do not keep the
commandment,; during a long period of years they met with vari-
ous changes of fortune; one nntion is oflen nt war with another ; and
the nation that conquers we see often treating their· prisoners wit!a
cruelty.
I must now for want of time paiS oqer many events to the wa:s or·
Samuel, who died and was put in a sc-pulchre under U• house, for they
d1d not but bury in those days as we do now. Saul was very anxious
to know how the battle that was pending between.him and his eneuJies-
would tcrm!nate. fie inquired of false p•·op·hets; l!hey cot.~ld, not tell.
him: he freely went to an olJ lady that was called a Witch on.a~;count.
of the wonders which she performed. She went ,.,·here Samuel was
laid nnd rai:3ed him ur out of the sepulchre. Saul was alarmed and
fell uron hb f:lcl'. The old woman, who was a ventriloquist. spoke.
which seemed lo S:lU! as though Samuel were speakmg. She judgiug
or the c·:ent of the battle, prophesied that Saul wouid be defea.teJ .-
T his so disheartened :::3uu!, tt bad a great effect in dt~couragiog him. s,J
32 CLAillVOTA'XT
thnt he was defeated in bnttle. I will now explnm now the oill womnt)
dt>ceived him: A person to make a gooo l·cntriloquist must }un·e large
lungs, which in connexion with <1D effort of tho throat urd all the vocal
organs, eno.bles one to convey the voice in such n m~mncr ns to rnak&
the sound appeo.r in any direc!ion. Tots was the rn:tnner in which
Balno.m was deceh•ed, as there was one of these vensrill)quist~ near,.
''born Balaam did not see.
I $hall now p:1ss on to the foundation of Jerusalem. 'J'his city w:-~s
commenced before Josephus or the Bible givc:s any account of it, by
oue of the tribes of the children of lsrnel. It was 1innlly nbantloncd,
but was afterwards rebuilt, and the inhabitants were prospered for
~ome time ; but they are finally overthrown and tlw city entirely de·
molishid. After this the city was again rebuilt, of which .Josephuc;
hilS spoken and corresponds with the Bible account. Bot here nlso is
contention and wrangling among themselves. At this time the~· do
not believe in another existence and supposed thnt the promised Mi!s-
siah was to be a king or ruler on the earth. llelie\'ing this, and prac-
ticing the many enormolls sins which they committed. they were lcCt
to themselves and seem to be their own destroyers, nnd were carried
into Babylonish captivity; and here we have another prophesy of
~loses fulfilled. During the 400 years of captivity, they enjoyed no
peace, night nor day; they were treated with severity: when it was
morning they longed for it to be night; when it w~s night they longed
(or it to be morning-they we!e compelled to anJure here many cru-
elties and wrongs, of which the Dible does not give us nny account.-
They were treated el"en worse 1han 1hey had treated rnany of their
own prisoners. Here aga1n i3 another evidence showing that sin can-
not go unpunished.
Your nttention will now be turned to the three tribes that wandered
from the land of Cann.un to this country. This was about 200 years
~Christ. They l'!ro~sed over what is now called Bherings Strnits,
on the ice, which was then much more narrow than at the present day.
This country being settled previous to the arrival or these tribes, they
were soon at war with the natives of this continent; they had many
long and bloody wars; and the ~mains of many of their fons and
cities are to be seen in diffeient p:trts oi our country. The lnst in-
habitants priucipally lived by hunting; while the natives cultivated
corn, the only grain that wa~ taised; and being ·unacquainted with.
fi rearm~;, they were often surprised and taken m their forts nnd cities.
These forts were built for the purpose of protecting themselves
irom the large animals I have spoken of. The natives gr.,duall' ro-
tired from the north and were fo1lowed up by the three tribes to the
south. 'fhe;o,e three trtoes being acquainted with the ntts of firearms
and agricui1111'P, increased in population muc1l faster thAn the natl\·es.
Now the 11atives lived in continual fear nll thf' time until we see
them Sllrl'nunded in a fort near what is now cnll~d Butfulo, in the S&ate
of New-York. The remains of the fort is plnin1y to he seen at the-
pr-s~ent duy. Here the nativea had a lnrge villagn- and cultivaled
2
L'ECTUnES•
.
fieius; and here they made o. strong stnnd nnd were aetcrmined to re-
sist nny further encroachments upon their rights. The fort of the
natl\·es was completely ::illi'I'OliOded by tho tribes; O.DU horE' they hatJ a
bloody ami hat d-fought bnttlo. ln attempting to tnl\0 the fort several
hut~dr?d lives were lest. This fort w~s surrounded by n rise of ground.
On tins rise of !!I'Ounu ot hill, the tribes were obliged to build a fort
before they could conqt,wr the nn.tivC)s. _\nd here, af'tcr surrounding
UH... cutting off the supplies from the fort of the nati\·cs, a.nd huving
the mh·antago of fire-at·ms, t!:cy clestro·.,;ed the for~ and killed the in·

permit me to leave tlti:) subject and give n description of this country
pre\'ious to the flood.
Pre\ ious to the deluge. the most of thts nnd the wcs~crn countries,
was u large boJy of water, containing rnany island~. There w:1s <l.
largo river passing frotu :.\lichigan Lake and \Vhat is now calle'l Chi-
cago down to. and emptying in, 1he ~lississippi Jiver, wniclt cmpti<1d it-
~elf into the Guli' of !\texico. At the pl'esent day a cnno.l is buil:.liug
in tho bed of this ancient ri\·er lt Chicago.
After the waters hnd rcturne I to their places, and when the ennh
started in its motion, (~1f'ter the flood,) the falls of Ningnrn broke
u.way several miles below where th'!y are at prcsf'ot. These i·tll:;
have gt·adunl!y worn away since the deluge nnJ drained the W'ller
frau: :nuch of this western country, and sturtcd the course of the .vn-
tens m·er the falls. This i3 why there is so much low land in this coun-
tn·-it has once been covered with water. The falls gradually we:ll'-
lll.g away nn 1 the lnnd becoming dry, the most of the soil is left rH

LECTURE XIV.
In this lecture 1shall continue the history of the lost tribes of Isra-
el whom I have briefly spokc11 of in~ pre\·ious lecture.

.resided i~ this country who came here previou::: to the tribe:-, ll:)hall
denomi:::late natives. By this designation you will know wbut party 1
mav refer to.
After overrunning this ~ountry and subduing the natives, the tri!:><>s
gained entire poss::s·-ion of this coun\ry. Many of them who were!
taken pri~oners, were compelled to work o.s ~lave- orad trcnted with
cruelty. In this, the tribe<; were not temporally pro"percu, as I ~hall

m0re or less, had sick spells. and we often supposed she could not live
through anoth~::r attack; that immedtately after the prescription, we
proceeded and gave her the medicine ; and that since that time, she has

nut, blue eyes, nnd fair complexion, with mildness of countenance. It
is marked by great activity of the blood vessels, fondness for exercise,
and un animated countenance. The brain partakes of the general
state, nnd is active.
The Billiuus temperament is recognized by black hair, dnrk ~kin,
moderate fulness and much firmness of flesh, with harshly expressed
outlines of the person. The functions partake of great energy of ac-
tion, which extend to the brain ; and th~ countenance, in consequence,
shows suong, marked, and dectded features.
The l\rervous temperament is recognized by fine thin hair, thin skin,
sma.H thin muscles, quickness in muscular motion, paleness of counte-
nance. and often delicate health. The whole nervous system, inclu·
ding the brain, is predominantly aetive, and the mental manifestations
are proportionably vivacious."

\Ve now call attention to some developernents which we briefly hin-
te-d at in 0ur last number, and to others equally as strnnge from ~Ir.
~avis of New .York~ Sometime since, Mr. Alverson. while ma,;net-
tze:l and speakmg ot the planetary system, remarked that one planet
bad been discovered. This announcement was unexpected. IIc sta·
ted also that another planet would be discovered within a vear.
This plnnet is the ninth, to \vhich i\h. Fishbaugh, in tl~e communi-
cation which followu, has especial reference. .Alll.l in that comrnu:lica-
tion, it will be seen, that .:.Ir. Davis had spok~n ol', and pointed out the
e:ghth planet in l'r1arch last, before even an nnticipatiou of the ex!st-
encc of such a planet was announced by any other person known, for
it was only discovered by l\11-. Galle, of Berlin, Sept. ~3, and seen from
London, Sept. 30. On. this point there can be but on~e conclusion, for
names of witnesses, d1tes &c. a~e given by Mt'. Fishbough. And then~
nppears to be a strking coincidence bet\veen the announcement of .l\Ir.
Ah crson and those of 1\Ir. Davi~! 1\Ir. Dwight Kellogg of our vil-
b.:;;e, nnd several other gentlemen were present at one announcement
of i\fr. Ahcl'SOD respecting the discoveries mentioned ~bove. nut it
may be supposed that there has been n corrcsponJence Letween some
of the witnesses of New York, and persons who wi:nesscd the experi-
ments here. \Ve would not sily that it is impossible fot· such to be
the case, but we believe there has been no such information transmit-
ted ; nor did any one hero, oven suppose that l\Ir. Davis had mauc the
discoveries. till we bad the pleasure of receiving tl.e announcement
from !Hr. Fishbough. through the Daily Tribune of the lOth ult:
From a pnragraph in the ''Tribune" of the 28th ult., credited to the
"New Haven Palladium/' and bearing the !:.ignature '' 0 .., (doubtless
Prof. Olmslenu,) I learn that news has, by a late arrh·a1 from Europe~
been received ut Yale college of the actual discevery of un eighth
planet ! It '"·as disco,·ercd by 1\I. Galle, of Berlin, on the night of
Sept. ~0. The existence of this body ,-..·as iH(erred a few months since
bv the French mathematician Le Verrier. from certain disturbances
in the motions of Urnnus; but the announcf'ment of this inferenc~J was
not made iu this country before some time in .1\lny or June last.
'·Not to dep1·ive tltc dtscoverers of this body ot' their descrveu honors~
and with no attempt to excite the mar\'ollousness of your readers, I
would sny that the existence not only of nn 8th but n Oth planet was
distinctly announced in March last. I will er.plain: Your readers were
informed some time since. that A. J. Da,·is, while in an nbnormnl and
exceedingly exalted mentnl condition, is engaged in tho dictataon of
the whole structure of thA UtJiverse, and developing that knowledge or
the universal Lnws of Nature on which can be based on no orgauiza-
tion of society on principles of harmo~y nnd reciprocat.i~n, t~o same
as penade the celestial spheres. H1s nbnormal cond1t10n, (m3uced

ln the snme manner, Mr. Davis has revealed the format1on, constJ-
t.utioo, geological devclopements, inhahita1zts, &c., of a11 the other
planets of our system. Indeed, his books uims to present in a ga11cral
way, a knowlcugc of the constitutio~, laws, r_rin~ipl~s nod d~'·clop~­
mcnts of the whole universe. He d1splays wlnle m Ius supenor state,
a power of anah·sis and generalization perfectly unparnlleu, anu ab-
solutely overwhelming; though whilo in the normnl state, he is al-
most entirely zmeducaled, und he is now only about 20 ycnrs old. If
these aro facts, (and if not, their falsity sltould, cart, and ''dJ.L be ex-
posed,) the rcOccLing mmd cannot fail to recognize tho unspeal:c.O/r;
importance of their bcurings. The only rational explannt:on of this
pscycbologicnl phenomenon is that which 1\fr. Davis llirnself gives,
viz: tnat his mind, while in the abnormal state, rcceives the influx of
the science understood in the spiritual spheres with which his mind as-
sociates.''
Now, tblt there is positive proof that Mr. Davis's discoveries, whik
in an abnormal and highly exalted mental cond1tion urc correct, and
that Mr. Alverson, while in the same mental condition hns corrobora-
ted the statements of ~Ir. Da\·is, it must carry conviction to the thinJ\-
ing mind of the :ruth of this most useful of sciences. These arc facts
which cannot be overthrown, and they cannot fail therefore, til have a
proper, a!ld their desirable impression upon the public mind.
And now we repeat, if thcso principles be true, who can be against
them~ They will force their way upon the admiration of the great
and good. Lilre the genial rays of the morning sun, they will drive
back the d:ll'kness from the face of the earth ; nnd the powers of cJark-
ne;)s. with their combined sneers, sarcasms and opposition cnn no mora
resist the onward march of truth, or prevent its wo r·ming influence and
irresistible light, than they can drive back, or resist the light of the king
of day.-fUcm of Science.
EDITORIAL NOTICE.
The present number of 1\Jr. Alverson's lectures, as will be seon on
reference to the title page, comprises only a :;:mall portion of what yet
zemnins to be published in different number~, all of which wjll neces-
sarilv make several VQiumes.
He has nlrcady given thirty 1h:e lectures, fourteen of which, are
published in this number. The others compnsa u brief outline of the
most important history from Saul down to the resurrection of our Sa-
viour, the curiosities nnd history of many of the ancient pyrnmi1ls in
Egypt, the history of tho lost tribes of Israel, und the lives of several
of the Apostles.
He _rror oses not fnr distant, to complete tho lectures on tho npoRtles,
and wlll proceed as fast ns convenient, with what rcmaius to conslitu~
the mattar for future numbers.
