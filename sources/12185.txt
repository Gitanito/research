When I left I fell down twice, second time saw myself laying in the street was getting farther away from my body and went into a tunnel.  The further I got away from my body the brighter the light got.

I started to sleep for long periods, went to the doctor. He said it was a viral infection go home, rest, and don't play in any soccer games. I played in an all-star game against the Germans I was running down the field fell down and blacked out. I went to my girlfriend's house coughed up some blood, and then went to a friend's house. I left there and that's when it happened. I was over my body. The order that happened after that gets confusing. When I got home, I asked my mom to go to the store. When she left my head started pounding, felt like it was going to explode. I managed to call my girlfriend's parents and told them I felt like I was dying and needed help right away. They called 911, when I was being put into the ambulance my mom had just got back from the store.

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?       No     At the time I was starting my senior year in high school, dated a lot, and really didn't think about religious beliefs. Now I believe in God but I don't attend church on a regular basis, but pray every night and I'm thankful for my kids and wife and my career.  

     After the NDE:

Was the experience difficult to express in words?      No
