            Experience Description :   

  My throat became more and more sore and I was trying to wake up until there came a point when the pain suddenly lifted. I felt no hurt, total release, no weight, and perfectly normal. My father was in the room with a lit candle that kept going out. He was removing my twin brothers of three years to safety. He came back for me feeling his way in the dark, lifted my body, and went through the door and down the stairs. I followed behind him and me to the front garden where he sat me on a chair. I came to consciousness, clutching the underneath of the chair seat in each hand. I still have the chair and I can still feel that place across my palms when I entered my body.
