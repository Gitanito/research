  Abstract

Eight million   Americans have experienced near-death as the result of medical emergencies.&nbsp;   This is due in part to medical technology that is becoming more able to   resuscitate patients after a clinical death.&nbsp; Doctors and nurses are becoming   more aware of this phenomenon because people are becoming more and more willing   to share their experiences. Near-death experiences are not gender-related or age   related.&nbsp; The purpose of this presentation is to educate medical professionals   about how to deal with patients who experience near-death to make it easier for   the patient and his support system to deal with the information.

Important Concepts   and Definitions    Near-death   Experience - clinical death accompanied with successful resuscitation.&nbsp; The   near-death experience occurs sometime within the span between the two.

  Operationalizations    This paper   is presented with information that was obtained as the result of the first hand   experience of clinicians and their subsequent contact with patients who had   experienced near-death.&nbsp; This would qualify this study as qualitative in nature   with self-report being the major information source.

  Major Findings

Problems in the   family often occur after a person experiences near-death.&nbsp; The person   experiences a major value-shift in which the become more religious, less afraid   of dying, more attuned to the principals of universal love, more knowledge   seeking, and less materialistic.&nbsp; This can be problematic for families that know   the individual as being one way and then suddenly shifting to another.

Also problematic for   families is an increased sensitivity to violence, both portrayed in the media   and in real-life.&nbsp; These sudden sensitivities are hard for families to   understand.&nbsp; This lack of understanding leads the adjustments that families must   make to accommodate these sensitivities as being difficult for the entire   family.    The shift   of the near-death experiencer wanting to 'learn for learning's sake' and being   in love with the world can be misinterpreted by the family of near-death   experiencers.&nbsp; They may see this shift as so drastic that they cannot adjust.&nbsp;   They may also see the changes as the near-death experiencer lacking the   loyalties that once facilitated the inner-workings of the family. </body>
