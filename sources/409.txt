 This was the first major Italian spiritualist journal, and one which from the beginning placed itself firmly under the aegis of the spiritism of Allan Kardec.  See "Notices bibliographiques," Revue Spirite 7/3 (March 1864), 94.  As the journal progressed, it was careful to say that its pages were freely available to spiritualists of all beliefs, and the journal came increasingly to include articles on reincarnation generally, the Count of Saint-Germain, free thought, the power of suggestion, etc.   The journal featured a Cronaca of current events (the Fox Sisters' confessions of fraud, the Summerland colony in California, etc.), and widely borrowed excerpts from the leading European, British and American journals.  Contributions by Carl du Prel, José Amigó y Pellicer, and others.  The journal was begun by "Teofilo Coreni" (Enrico Dalmazzo, 1817-1892), who published the journal for the first year.  He was a Catholic, which excluded him from the mainstream of liberal and Mazzinian spiritualism in Italy.  He was replaced by Filalete (Vincenzo G. Scarpa, 1835-1912), a high-school teacher (tutor of the king's son), prominent Freemason and the one-time secretary of Cavour.  He was also a medium himself and mediated the spirits of a variety of Italian notables.  The journal and its several contemporaries in Northern Italy have been seen as illustrative of the north/south cultural split in Italy at the time.  The Year Book of Spiritualism noted in a review of this journal in 1871: "The knowledge of the New Philosophy is not evenly diffused through the several regions constituting the kingdom of' Italy. Lowest in the scale of advancement are to be found Sicily and Naples, where the populace is less enlightened, and priest-craft has more hold on the will and understanding of woman, than in the north of the Peninsula."  While generally accepted as a truism in English-language commentary, this sentiment, as Massimo Marra has forcefully pointed out, is actually a political jibe designed to justify the unification of the peninsula under the House of Savoy, and it ignores the active Kardecist circles in Naples at the time around Baron Vincenzo Caprara and Giovanni Damiani.  Also, it doesn't take into account the early Italian spiritist journals like Il Spiritismo: Giornale di psicologia sperimentale, published in Palermo the year before Annali, and Voce de Dio, published in Catania two years later.  The explanation for the predominance of spiritism and its journals in the North must be sought elsewhere than in the priest-ridden southern population.
