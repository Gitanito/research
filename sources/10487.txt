  		              		Experience Description:   

      On the evening of August 8, 2007, while coming back from McDonald's with my mother.  We had a discussion about the way I was leading my life. At the time I was not leading a life of a saint and I was causing her concern for my well being. At the moment when my mother told me to take care of myself,   the radio was starting my grandfather's song, who passed several years ago, a song that had been played at his funeral 'Life is so fragile' from Luc De la Rocheliere. My mother said to me 'You see this is a sign from your grandfather.' At that moment, I was laughing as I didn't believe in those things.
  
  The next day the phone was ringing, a friend  called me to find out what I was doing. He wanted to take me  to get my pay check in the neighboring city. I told him 'Of course, the more that I'm dealing with you'.
  
  In the evening when we were returning, I had the thought to get a drink in a small bar along the highway. About one and a half hours, later I didn't feel well so we left. My friend was driving and I fell asleep  on the passenger seat.
  
  We were 15 kilometers from home, when he lost control of the car between one highway and the other.  The car rolled over several times.
  
  I  woke up, believing that it was a dream. But when I opened my eyes, I saw people running towards us because  they had seen the accident.  I saw a lifeless body on the ground, it was mine. I saw the blood surrounding my head, the shoe of my right foot was missing, and I saw the people coming around my body. 
  
  When I saw the ambulance, I saw the paramedics taking care of my body. Then they covered my head with a white sheet and loaded me  onto a stretcher and into the ambulance. When the doors of the ambulance closed, I saw a big white flash that was similar to a flash of lightning during a thunderstorm. Then everything went black. 

  When I woke up, I was in hospital in intensive care with respirators and various machines connected to my body. During the time when I was out of my body, I felt a great relief. I didn't feel the weight of my body or  the stress of life. I didn't feel anything anymore.
  
  One or two years after this experience, I had not changed my life. I was living my life rather worse rather than better. I understood nothing about it until one evening, when I went to bed at the small home of my parents. I dreamt that  I was in hell. There is a stream of fire in which people were suffering and agonizing in a river of lava. I saw a woman imprisoned in the lava and beings flying over this place. Everything was dark, except for the  light of  the flames. Then the woman told me, 'quick save yourself! if he  sees you, you will be caught'. At the moment when I woke up, a hideous face appeared to me. I was wide  awake all night long.
  
  Sometime later, I was dreaming again.   In the dream I woke up because our front door was rattling as if somebody was trying to get into the house. When I came to the doorstep, I saw myself. But my face was very nasty and I never opened the door.
  
  Ever since, I have changed and I try to lead a normal life in Happiness and love.  I'm very scared of what might wait for me on the other side, as now I believe in hell and paradise.
