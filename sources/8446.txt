        Morse, Melvin, M.D., &amp;   Perry, Paul (1990).&nbsp; Learning from the Near-Death Experiences of Children&nbsp;   Closer to the Light.&nbsp; New York, NY:&nbsp; Villard Books.

  Sample    The sample   size is never indicated, but all of the participants in this book are people who   experienced near-death when they were children.&nbsp; If it was not possible to   interview them at that time, Dr. Morse tracked them down when they reached   adulthood to take their story about their near-death experience.

  Methodology    Subjects   were interviewed about what they experienced during their near-death   experience.&nbsp; Descriptions were recorded of these accounts and major trends were   then reported in anecdotal stories of the subjects.&nbsp; Dr. Morse screened out   those who had a possibility of being mentally ill or users of recreational   drugs.

  Abstract

Dr. Morse reports on   the experiences of near-death experiences.&nbsp; He also reports on his own   experiences of having dreamed that his father had something to tell him, calling   his mother, and finding out his father had just died.&nbsp; Other things presented in   this book are:&nbsp; &nbsp;an explanation of what got him interested in studying   near-death phenomena, his first experience with near-death experience with a   patient of his in Seattle, reports of patient's families that experienced their   children telling them of their death and of the happiness that they were   experiencing in heaven, how near-death experiences differ from drug reaction or   reactions to lack of oxygen in the blood, and first hand accounts of patients   experiences that lead the researcher to come up with a commonly reported   phenomena of near-death experience.

Important Concepts   and Definitions    Near-Death   Experience ' experienced by patients who are clinically dead but then are   resuscitated.&nbsp; These experiences are reported as occurring to the subject during   the time that they are no longer clinically alive.&nbsp;

Operationalizations    The   reports contained in this book are qualitative in nature having been the actual   reports of the patient's and family's experiences.&nbsp; There is also an element of   self-report in that Dr. Morse describes his own experiences in the field and in   his personal life regarding people's deaths and leading him to the conclusion   that there is a life after death.

  Major Findings

A typical reporting   of how near-death experiences by a child in a family change the family is   reported in Dr. Morse's first case of dealing with a near-death experiencer.&nbsp;   Katie was a near drowning.&nbsp; She was hooked up to all kinds of medical apparatus   and was not expected to live by anyone including Dr. Morse.&nbsp; On the third day   that she was being treated, she woke up and told Dr. Morse her story about what   she had experienced when she had been clinically dead.&nbsp; She recovers, goes home,   and then the family reports uncharacteristic changes that happen to the girl as   the result of this experience.

Katie's parents   report that Katie is always helping to make things better for others.&nbsp; She has   other siblings who are also good kids, but Katie is markedly different in this   respect.&nbsp; She, 'helps her mother run a large household'has a part-time job, gets   good grades, excels in ballet, and has never taken drugs (p. 136).'&nbsp; As a matter   of fact, she reports that she can't imagine why anyone would want to experiment   with drugs at all.&nbsp; She also believes that she was sent back to Earth by God   whose plan for her was for her to help her mother.    The key   reason for the description of Katie's near-death experience and its aftermath is   that it is indicative of what is found in the other near-death experiencers.&nbsp;   The people interviewed were successful and driven toward doing something good in   the world.&nbsp; The near-death experience turned their lives around for the better.&nbsp;   The effects were visible to those closest to them. </body>
