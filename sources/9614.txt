  		              		Experience Description   

    I found myself walking through a tunnel, along with other people. I saw people  walking their dogs, moms with  thier pushchairs, business men  holding their briefcases, etc. There were  people from all walks of life. I found myself in a beautiful garden with colors so vivid. The colors were unlike any on earth. The grass was neatly cut and the hedges trimmed so perfectly. I walked along a little path, as though I were just on a little visit. The place was warm and light. The temperature was perfect, not too hot and not too cold. I then turned back into the tunnel and I was walking in an opposite direction of everyone else. 

  A few days later, I woke up  in hospital. I had come out of a 10 day  coma.  I felt a huge rush of energy as if I had been picked up and crashed through the hospital roof. I was told I had work to do in life, and not to be afraid of death. The clock said exactly 1:00 a.m.
