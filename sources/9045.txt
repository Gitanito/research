  		              		Experience Description   

  I was at a summer-time pool party with my mother, at the home of her friend from nursing school. There were a lot of ladies there, with all of their children. I was one of the youngest children at the party. I didn't know how to swim, so I was staying in the shallow end of the pool. The older kids kept telling me that I should go down the slide, because it's so much fun. I kept telling them 'no' because I couldn't swim. Again, they told me to go down the slide and they would help me back to the shallow end. I agreed. I went down the slide. I was making my way back to the shallow end by placing a hand on one child's shoulder, then the next child's shoulder, etc. About the fourth shoulder that I put my hand on, my hand slipped off. I went under water and kept sinking farther into the deep end of the pool. 
  
  I saw an incredibly bright light, and then woke up, coughing up water, next to the pool. 

  I don't know how I got out of the pool.   I can still see the whole experience clear as day.   I vividly remember that for several days following this experience, I had an overwhelming feeling of peace.
