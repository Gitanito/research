  		              		Experience Description   

    My brother, Bill, age 62 is mentally disabled with an IQ approximately 30 and a mental age around 5 years old. He can communicate very well and read a little. But he  can't write, drive, live or be alone, have a job, handle money, cook,  etc. I am Bill's youngest sister, Cathy.
  
  On 3/22/18, our Mom and I took Bill to have surgery on his eye to remove a cataract. Because of his disability, he required general anesthesia. He has never had an operation or been under before. He was very upset with my Mom about having to have the operation and didn't understand it. He told the nurses he was going to move into the surgery center and live with them so he didn't have to live with 'her.' He was referring to the woman making him have the operation. (haha). The surgery center loved Bill and his sense of humor; and took extra good care of him. Before the surgery he got scared and was crying while he reached out to my Mom.  He was no longer upset with her. We assured him he would be fine,  that they were going to give him something to fall asleep, and when he woke up it would be over. My Mom told him, like she always does before he goes to sleep, that she would see him in Dreamland and that she would be on the swings. She asked where he would be. He said, 'On the swings.'
  
  The surgery was a success, although it was very hard for him coming out of the anesthesia. He was thrashing around and we all had to hold him down. When he finally woke up, he was good.  He  gave me a big hug and patted the male nurse on the back to thank him.
  
  After we left the surgery center, my Mom asked  Bill  if he saw her in Dreamland. He said, 'No. But I saw Dad and Grandma and Grandpa.' My Dad passed away 2 years ago and our grandparents passed away over 30 years ago. My Mom asked, 'Really? You didn't see me in Dreamland?' Then he repeated it again, 'No. I saw Dad and Grandma and Grandpa.' 
  
  We didn't push it because he was tired, hungry and his voice was raspy. Later after dinner, my Mom asked Bill about it again without putting ideas in his head. She asked,'So what happened when you fell asleep?' He said, 'I saw Dad and Grandma and Grandpa.' She asked what they said and he replied, 'They said good job, Bill.' Then she asked what they were doing and he said, 'Nothing, they were just really happy.' He said my dad was wearing his regular clothes, but with slippers. My Grandma was in a dress and shoes. Then he said, ''Then I had to leave and Dad said, 'Tell everyone I said hello.''

  My Mom asked if he thought he was in heaven and he said, 'Yes.'
