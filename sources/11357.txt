  		              		Experience Description   

    It was Saturday, January 11, 1986, and winter in Chicago, Illinois. I was 25 years old. My husband, at the time,  our 9½ month old baby son, and I   went out to go shopping. 
  
  It was a sunny, cold day with snow on the ground but the roads were clear. We were on a busy street turning left and my husband was driving. I was in the passenger seat and our baby was behind the driver’s seat in a car seat. We were at a stop light that was green and the light was turning red. The traffic coming opposite our direction was beginning to stop. The light turned red and all of the cars stopped but one. It was a full-size van with a 16-year-old boy driving.  (Later we found out the two 16-year-old boys  were on their way  home from work and the driver said 'I’m going to go faster to beat the light.')
  
  I yelled to my husband, 'He’s not stopping!' and then we crashed. Our car was part way turning left so the van hit my passenger-side of the door. We later heard witnesses say our car spun in circles. After we stopped, my husband said that I said. 'Call on Jesus, He’ll help us'. I passed out. 

  The police and ambulance came and they had to pry the passenger door open because of the damage done to it. I think my husband was holding our baby as all of this was happening.   They got me out and put me in an ambulance. Later my husband told me that I was saying, 'ouch, ouch' when they would go over bumps on the road, so the ambulance driver went slower for me. I was still passed out so I don’t remember that.
  
  At the hospital, I was on a bed. I’m guessing I was in the emergency room. My husband called his parents and they came. My husband, our baby and his parents were at the hospital in another room or behind a curtain from where I was lying.  I believe only nurses or maybe a doctor were allowed  in and out of that area with me. I don’t know for sure because I was somewhere else.
  
  Jesus asked me if I wanted to see where I was. I nodded, 'Yes.'  He showed me that He was in front of me and wearing a white robe, sitting on a tall white chair.  I was at His feet kneeling with the back of my thighs on my calves in almost a sitting position. I had my hands covering my face and  was crying. I was begging, 'Let me live, please let me live!' I look up from my hands and saw Jesus  sitting next to God. God had a round, white cloud in front of Him, so I could not see the front of Him. But I could see part of the side and the back of him. He was sitting down in a tall white chair like Jesus was. Jesus turned to God and asked Him, 'Could she, live?' God motioned something to Jesus and Jesus suddenly stood up and  yelled in a loud, almost a celebratory voice, 'He said Yes! He said Yes!' Jesus had both of His hands raised as he happily stood and yelled this.  It seemed like he was signaling the news to others.  

  The next thing I knew, I was in my body and woke up. A nurse came to me right away and said that I was in a car accident and in the hospital. Theyimmediately got my husband. I was thinking in my mind, 'I’m not telling anyone about what just happened.' But the first thing I did was to tell him, 'I was in Heaven and saw Jesus.' My husband told me  they had been in the waiting room for a long time and that they were all tired and hungry. The nurses gave our baby fresh juice or milk for his baby bottle, which I was so grateful for. 
  
  I said to the nurse, 'I’m going to get up from here.' I remember feeling uncomfortable and wanted to get up to feel better. She said, 'I wouldn’t do that if I were you'. After that they took me for x-rays and tests and wheeled me around in the bed. I had 6 broken bones (4 ribs and 2 pelvic bones) and a punctured lung. The doctors  said I had a bruised liver and was probably bleeding  and bruised inside in other places too. I was in the intensive care unit for a week. I had a chest tube put in for my lungs, which was so painful. Then after about a week of intensive care unit, I was in a regular room to recover for 3 more weeks. 

  I was in the hospital for a month. I went home in an ambulance because they didn’t want to bend my pelvic area while it was healing. I also had a wheelchair for when I was finally able to sit in a chair.  Our baby only had a cut on his lip and my husband wasn’t injured. My sister-in-law watched our baby while my husband went to work.  

  One day, while I was sitting in the wheel chair in the kitchen, I said to myself, 'I feel better, stronger.' I stood up and walked to the refrigerator. Then I sat back down. I took steps, little by little, until eventually I was  completely healed and  able to walk. I was able to have my baby back at home with me during the day too.  I waited 3 years to have another baby, boy, and 2 years later had a baby girl. 
  
  As I looked back over time on the NDE, the message I received was, 'Don’t Be Afraid. I have you safe and secure. I’m holding you tight.' God is always right here with us, always.

I did not talk to him directly.

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It's hard to describe in words what I was feeling, thinking, doing, and seeing. It was bright and white there. It's also hard to describe that I 'knew' God was there but I didn't see Him exactly. I just saw a round white cloud in front of Him but I knew it was Him. I also noticed that God was paying attention to something else while I was at Jesus's feet crying. I remember thinking 'Why doesn't God know I'm here' or 'What's going on right in front of Jesus who is right next to Him.' Plus, Jesus asked God if I could live and God answered Him not me. I was also wondering why Jesus didn't tell me what God said but suddenly stood up and yelled 'He said Yes' like he was signaling to others. I really just observed it all and I was not in any pain up there.  
  
How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  I will always remember this experience, clearly and forever.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

  Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes. The fact that God let me live. Amazing!!! That I got to 'see' with spiritual eyes Jesus, God, and myself in this experience is so special to me. It was a unique experience just for me. I am grateful. Also, after the experience I felt the message is 'don't be afraid. I have you'.  
  
Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Minutes after my experience I shared it with my then husband. I also shared it with family. Their reactions, just listened. I don't think they were influenced, not that I know of.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I have no doubt it happened. Nothing can change my mind from it. It is very real to me.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     It is very real to me. I'll never change that. I still remember it.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         I don't know why it happened. I just know that it did happen. And I'm happy that it did happen.  

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         These were all good questions.
