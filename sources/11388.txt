It was almost 4 am. I woke up with a sharp pain in my head and chest area. I went to the bathroom. I got out of bed and I passed out for almost twenty seconds, if not more. I saw myself from the ceiling and my body was laying on the floor. Then I came back to my body and called 911. In the emergency room, I was laying on my bed, and I felt something touching my hair. I opened my eyes. It was my grandmother. She had passed away a long time ago. She told me to light five candles. When I closed my eyes again, she was gone. I even felt her weight on my bed, and when she left, I felt the bed move.
