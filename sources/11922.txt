  		              		Experience Description   

    After I lost my awareness of actual time and place, I woke up on the operating table. 

I saw the medical procedures being performed on my body. I felt warmth and saw, or maybe felt, light.  I realized there were other Beings or people around me. We were suspended over my body. These people were my relatives who had died. I talked to them and got advice on how to return to my body. The time when I was in that light was carefree, painless and full of peace. 

     Later, when I went to the hospital with flowers to thank for saving my life, I recognized the doctors and nurses who had been trying to save me. 

  I am not afraid of death and it is actually a positive memory. That moment was rich and full of details that escape my memory, but their effect is lasting.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         Incredibly fast  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning. Time was virtual and elusive.    

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         Incredibly more vivid  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       It can be compared to watching a film on an old analogue TV set with an HD television and full of colors.

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         I remembered many past events     It was a conversation with my relatives about my life.  There was no 'film.'  

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life.   After a conversation that was more like a flow of information between me and my relatives, I made a decision to return.
