  		              		Experience Description   

  In 2005, I went to the hospital because I tried to drink a cup of coffee and where I thought it was, I couldn’t grab it. It was 6 inches from the place where I saw it. I got scared and ran to the hospital without worrying about a cough that didn’t even allow me to speak. There, they diagnosed me with atypical pneumonia but I didn’t have phlegm or expectorations, only a lot of coughing. It was all caused by a generalized lupus erythematosus.

  After 15 days, I left the hospital with the recommended doses of cortizone and medications for  joint pain that were sufficiently strong to control the lupus, but which wouldn’t affect other parts of my body.

    That’s how the years passed until December 5, 2015. I entered the hospital because I couldn’t breathe. I was kept in the hospital for tests and they didn’t find anything abnormal. I left on the 12th to return on the 18th with a new crisis in my lungs that was keeping me from breathing. I had pulmonary edema. This time they took a liter of blood from my lungs. I was there until  December 26, and they told me that the danger had passed and that I was well.

    I returned to the hospital on February 23 with a great deal of fatigue and unable to breathe again. On this occasion I put myself in God’s hands, because I felt it that it was already the end and in fact it I already wanted to die because I was very tired. I had already endured ten years of continual joint pain, constant fatigue, and being overweight by 110 pounds caused by so many steroids and so much cortizone that I was given to control the inflammation in my joints So I was really exhausted.  

So I said goodbye to everyone and on just the second day in the hospital, they transferred me to intensive care, first with nasal ports for oxygen, then a mask, and later they intubated me with a feeding tube and fed me this way for eight days. After that, they removed the tube and gave me a tracheotomy. Because I was in this condition, my doctors gave my husband a very discouraging prognosis. They told him that I had no possibility of recovering, and that if I recovered at all, I would have to be in a wheelchair and connected to an oxygen machine because my lungs were not able to regenerate enough because the damage had been so great.

  In the process of the tracheotomy, which they did only to keep administering Mab Thera, a medicine recommended by my rheumatologist after the pneumologist said there was nothing else to be done, they let me go. The medicine was supposed to take effect in no later than two days, but five days passed and I only became more critical. The doctors had already given up, when suddenly the pneumologist jumped up and told my husband he didn’t know whose opinion we were respecting, but that we should listen to him because something unexpected was happening. My body began to show very slight signs of improvement, but to him the improvements were enormous.

  At that moment, I had left my body and began to return home. I suddenly saw myself as a light, floating in a universe full of colors and forms that opened and closed, and I entered them and went through them full of joy, of happiness, of peace—a joy which there are no words to explain--until I came to another portal, so to speak, in which there was a female figure. She was only a light, but when she spoke, she identified herself as an aunt who had died four months before. And she told me, “Adriana, if you pass through here, you will not be able to return.” I understood that she was giving me a choice. I was still me, Adriana. I was not my body, but I was my essence, and I began to ask myself what there was to return to? Why leave that place where I was so happy, so full, and with such great joy and love in my heart, when I heard my daughter’s voice, telling me, “Mom, I need you for my wedding.” She didn’t have a boyfriend and during the 45 days that I had been in intensive care, she always told me that if I was exhausted, to leave, not to stay for them. But this day was different. She asked me to come back. I understood that we are in this world for love, because only a love of that magnitude could make us leave that peace and the unimaginable joy of that plane. When I made the decision to return, I heard a male voice, telling me, “It is not going to be easy, but the best years of your life were still to come.” And so it was, from that point on, my recovery was wonderful. My alveolus began to function, my tracheotomy tube was removed. They told me I would not be able to talk without covering the hole for three to five days while it healed, and that evening I was talking and taking medication as if I had never had never had the tracheotomy. And it’s been that way since. Today, I breathe without oxygen, I walk, I travel. Only at altitudes of over 1600 feet above sea level do I need a little extra oxygen. My life is completely normal. I weigh 180 pounds, nothing hurts, and I feel better than ever.

NDE Elements:       

At the time of your experience, was there an associated life-threatening event?        Yes   Illness        Life threatening event, but not clinical death   Yes, I suffered from lupus that attacked my lungs, which collapsed when my alveolus stopped working, and the vein to the lungs was 78% closed. The pneumologist said that my body was not responding and if it did not, I would not be able to move, do exercise, or breathe without the help of concentrated oxygen, because my lungs were not regenerating from the damage that they had suffered.

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       During the experience, all of my senses were open.

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   All those brilliantly colored lights are supernatural on this plane. The pink is more pink, clearer, the blue, the green, the purple, everything was more brilliantly colored than can ever be seen here.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     A clearly mystical or unearthly realm. I entered into nebulas and galaxies, so to speak.

Did you have a feeling of joy?         Incredible joy  

Did you feel a sense of harmony or unity with the universe?       I felt united or one with the world  

Did you suddenly seem to understand everything?         Everything about the universe     As it is, I realized that we are part of the entire universe. We are a small spark of light, of the same material as everything that surrounds us, that everything comes from the same source that I came from. I was one with everything.  

Did scenes from your past come back to you?         No

I came to a definite conscious decision to return to life   When I heard the voice of my daughter telling me she needed me for her wedding, I remember having consciously analyzed the possibility of remaining or returning, with the promise of that voice that the best was yet to come.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic   Even though I was raised within the Catholic Church, at that moment I had been involved in Buddhism, and my faith was only in God, not in the church as an organization.  

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Today I believe only in God, not in churches as institutions anymore.  

What is your religion now?         No comment   Today, I no longer believe in religions. I know that there is only one creator, which everything springs from. Religions just control. God is in everything and religions are not needed.  

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     I fully believed that when we die, our soul continues on its path, that death is a sign that our path, our task on this plane is finished and it is our time to return to our home with the father. What I never imagined is that one could be given the option to return to being on this plane. I simply thought that coming to this plane could only be done to bring a baby into this world with a specific task. I also had no idea that when you left, you were conscious of who you are. I thought that one’s individual consciousness was lost upon entering that space where I was not allowed to stay.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     My entire life is different now. Now, I live; I don’t just survive. Now, I enjoy and delight in life, where before I just watched the days go by. Today I appreciate everything I have and the miracles that present themselves every day. If I need something, it comes to me quickly and perfectly.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin that I identified as an aunt by her voice, and when I agreed to return, a voice of another being that told me it would not be easy but that the best years of my life were still to come. And I believed that voice was the voice of my God, telling me that he was giving me my life anew, with that promise.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Yes   I cannot give it a name, except to say that it was the creator that formed everything and that this wonderful promise came from him.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         Yes     The road was known. I knew where to go, and even though the colors fascinated me, they were not unknown to me. I saw them knowing only that they were the way back home.  

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     It really proves that we are all one. We start from the same source, from that wonderful energy that moves us.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     That supreme being let me make the decision to return, and after he knew that I was going to return, he spoke to me, letting me know that I was not leaving all that behind, that I was bringing with me a part of that wonderful experience, healing my body, filling me with a love and gratitude toward life that I did not have before.  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   We are all part of the same whole. When we understand that we are not this body, but what is inside it—that light, that divine spark of the same material as the creator, then the problems cease to be, because what we think is manifested in a very clearly and quickly on this plan. We are creators of our lives and of that which surrounds us. And the more people who become aware of this, the more unity, peace, and love there will be in this world, because it isn’t necessary to lie, to desire, to envy because everything is already given, everything s part of us. We simply have to let go of prejudices.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     I understood we are like administrators or caretakers of this planet; therefore, everyone comes with different gifts and qualities to adapt themselves according to their task. I also understood, that the relationship of the elements is one with us, but the comforts, the mundane, the technological have led us to forget that we are one with everything that surrounds us, leading us to a world of competition and useless egos.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     Of course it continues. The body ends, but the light or energy that moves us returns to the source.  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         Yes     If we lay aside what we really know and we come to learn and to awaken that consciousness, which has become dormant from human ideas, learning, and prejudices, life would be a constant gift.  

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     I understood that if you leave the source, if you turn off your light, all life experience will be a penalty, because you will want to find solutions from your ego, from the material, from your analytical mind, not from the heart, where everything happens automatically.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     We are here only for love. We return with the hope of not forgetting where we came from or who we are, to share this life with love, being able to be much more like the one above. Everything here is in perfect balance if you live from love.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     I love life and everything that surrounds me. I am happy with what I have, and I thank him from my heart. I know that we all have the opportunity to live better if we wish. And I know that what moves me is that light, that energy that comes from the creator, and that it will take me back home in due time.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes People see me differently, as more cheerful and happy and as more inviting to be with.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   Because there are not words to describe the infinite joy that filled me, nor to describe the spaces full of totally brilliant lights and colors that I was moving through. Today, I know that they are nebulas because when searching something similar to put in a video, I found them, and I couldn’t contain my weeping—they were exactly like those that I had seen, which I went in and out of, to arrive at one that was green with gold, where they told me that if I passed through, I would not be able to return. I have not been able to explain those colors and forms, except to say that they are nebulas.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The feeling of peace and the assurance that it would be OK. I didn’t have the slightest doubt about what would happen.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Before, I did not have the feeling of peace, of joy that I have today. And even when I did feel them, they did not compare with what I felt when I was on the other plane.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    About six months after, and they believed me because even the doctors were startled at the improvement of my body. Also, I asked my husband if he had told me that the best years of my life were yet to come, because I wanted to confirm that I had not imagined it, and he told me, no, he would never have made me that promise with the prognosis that the doctors had given.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was probably not real      Since they had given me a lot of medications, I first came to think that it was one of those hallucinations. But I began to think and feel differently. I began to love my body and to listen to it and to feel it as never before. And I began to realize that if I wanted or asked for something of God, it manifested.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     God has taken me by the hand in a very palpable way. If I request or ask something, the answer comes by some means or person.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Why do you think you came back?  Did you forget or lose the sharpness of what you experienced?  What did you change in your current life?  How did your family react?
