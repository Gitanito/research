  		              		Experience Description   

    I was three years on a warm, summer evening.  My pink bounce ball had rolled off the pier and into the water.  I walked off the pier after my ball.  No one was around watching me. I remember standing on the floor of the ocean with the water above my head.  I wasn’t afraid. 

  Then, I was standing above the water watching myself lying on the beach and seeing my parents and other members of my family kneeling over me.  They were upset as they were trying to save my life. As I was watching, I realized there was someone beside me. This figure was much taller than me and taller than the average person. The figure felt older and more intelligent than me. I never turned to look at the figure.  This figure felt like a guide more than like a family member.  It was like we both belonged where we were and we both felt the same way about my family. I felt like I was a higher intelligence who knew more than a 3 year old would know. I felt like this was the real me and I was where I really came from. 

  I know I didn’t want to go back into my body. I felt nothing for those people on the beach.  I knew they loved me and were scared.  I felt I didn’t belong with them and that their existence was confusing, complicated, and much less than my true existence. They didn’t have the knowledge that I had. I knew where I was standing was real as it felt like home. Both, myself and the figure next to me, had a greater awareness and consciousness than my family by my earthly body.  I was completely in the moment. 

  I felt as if I had an understanding of everything. I wasn’t afraid but I knew I didn’t want to go back to my body. I didn’t look at my parents like they were my mom and dad. I looked at them like I didn’t belong with them because I was not one of them. There was a moment when I realized I was going to go back and I felt that the figure was there to give me the understanding that I needed to go back. Then, I heard a very loud clap, like a crack of thunder. 

  I was back in my body and surrounded by my family.  I was coughing up water and shaking violently. I was wet, cold, and crying as I sought the safety of my family. 

  I didn’t think about what had happened until much later. I do remember for many years afterwards that whenever my siblings were bullying me, I would go to my room, cry, and say aloud 'I want to come home.  Why won’t you let me come home? I don’t want to stay here.'  I would fall asleep and wake up feeling fine. Eventually all that stopped. But I never forgot that experience. I remember it so clearly, even today. I can still hear the clap and remember how it felt being with the figure beside me. Sometimes I wonder why I didn’t see a bright light, feel warm, or have joyful feelings.
