But I will say this, I saw everything happen like I was floating so to speak above (my wife confirmed as I told her about the conversation herself and an emergency medical technician was having in the other part of the house as I was being worked on). I talked to a person whom I did not know, I can't be sure but it seems that I had a choice, to stay or come back, I wasn't scared even though at the time I didn't believe in God or anything of that nature I was sure at the time this life wasn't the only thing we have. It seemed to last like about thirty to forty minutes but I was only three or four. I felt no fear, no pain, I was in total calm - it's hard to describe.  It is like being out of air but not having to gasp for a breath that's the feeling, I remember having.  It's not a bad feeling but a little strange at the time. I was shown not to be afraid but I kept looking down at my wife. I have been married since seventeen years old had two boys almost out of high school. I didn't want to leave so I said no, I know now I have nothing to fear I want to go back and spend time with them. Then I woke up in the ambulance. There is more but like I said I don't like to type.
