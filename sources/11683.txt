  		              		Experience Description   

    I am not sure whether what happened to me was really a near-death experience or something else. While reading NDEs, I found something similar to what happened to me  and that worried me a lot. This  frightened me, especially since I was never a rude person with anyone and my behaviors are normal.  

  I was in the university with a blood donation cart.  So, I went to donate blood. The doctor took a blood sample from my finger and then put me in the cart.  I lay on the bed and he put an injection in my arm. After a few minutes, I felt dizzy and wanted to tell the doctor, but I couldn't because I passed out first. 

  During my unconsciousness, I saw a blue spiral that was taking me down and pulling me very strongly.  I felt like I would fall forever. I had a strong feeling that I would never return.  

  The fainting lasted for about two minutes, but I felt like hours had passed.   I was so amazed.  

  I didn't know if this was near-death experience or just something else because the experience was terrifying for me. Because I was  falling down and had a feeling that what was happening was so eternal and real, the experience worried me a lot.

After the NDE:       

  Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Uncertain.   My feeling was a mixture of the bad feelings I had experienced, especially the feeling of insecurity. Maybe because at this time I was suffering from major depression and contemplating suicide.

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably not real.      I tried to understand what happened, but I couldn't.   I asked another doctor, who told me that my experience was  normal, although,  he did not explain  why.
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         I hope to know if this was really near death or something normal because I feel anxious now that I find that what I felt is similar to what happened to those who went to Hell.  [Note from Jody:  Many people can be afraid when they are confronted with an experience they are unfamiliar with.  For instance, some people are afraid of a void, yet others feel loved and secure.  Yara did not go to hell, but may have been traveling to the other side.  If the experience had lasted longer, my guess is she would have experienced the typical love, peace, and happiness that others describe.]
