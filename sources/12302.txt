My head hit the roof of the truck two times before hitting the back window three times, shattering that window completely. I was in and out of consciousness on the way to the hospital and woke up three hours after arriving to the hospital. 

The only thing I remembered for my NDE was there were two or three hooded shadows facing me, one was trying to touch me and I kept slapping at whatever he was trying to grab me with. It didn't look like a hand but more like a hooded sleeve. The weird thing about my NDE is that I was GIGGLING while trying to slap it away, when I think I should have been scared!! I wasn't scared though. 

I couldn't get it out of my mind afterwards and was very depressed for months that I was met with a hooded creature. This experience has led me to believe I am going to hell, because I believe in God but I don't live exactly according to the ways.
