GO ON'
Some years ago a Methodist revival service
was in progress. The minister asked each In-
dividual to stand up and tell the others what,
if any, passage from the Bible had been a
special comfort in his or her life.
Well back in the church sat a little old lady
who everyone knew as "Aunt Polly Brown."
She was a quaint character, very ignorant,
but thoroughly self-assured; and was forever
making a ludicrous display of her ignorance,
to the vast amusement of her friends and fel-
low members of the church; but everybody
liked her because she was the mother of thir-
teen wild, robust, healthy middle-west child-
ren with whom she had spent most of her mar-
ried life on the farm. Everybody knew what
an affliction those ungoverncd and ungovern-
able children had been to her, and they mar-

Some years ago a Methodist revival service

smile, or manifest any outward show of Cheer-
fulness.
The minister finally got around to Aunt
Polly. He called on her:
"Aunt Polly, I'm sure there must be some
special passage in the good Book that has been
an inspiration to you; and I'm sure those who
are here will be glad to hear from you. The
words that have helped you over the hard
places may be of help to many of your listen-
ers."
Aunt Polly slowly and laboriously got to
her feet. "Yes, Dr. Graham, through all the
vexations and trials of my life as a mother, I
have found the deepest joy and comfort in
those beautiful and touching words of our
Savior—'Grin and Bear It'."
To her utter horror and confusion, the en-
tire audience, including the minister, roared
with laughter. With an expression of embar-
rassment and disgust on her dear old face,
Aunt Polly sat down. When the minister was
able to control his emotions, he graciously re-
sponded to her effort
:
"Thank you. Aunt Polly; we all know how
well you have exemplified the meaning of

The minister Hnally got around to Aunt
Polly. He called on her:

an
inspiration to you; and I'm sure those who
are here will be glad to hear from you. The
words that have helped you over the hard

those touching words in your daily life; and
I am sure we shall all remember them, and I
hope we shall profit by them. For me they
will have a new meaning and a higher inspira-
tion henceforth."
In the midst of such a family of wild and
lawless children, it is not difficult to imagine
many occasions when the only thing left for
the good old mother to do was simply to
"Grin and Bear It."
But there is a deep, underlying psychol-
ogical significance embodied within that
homely expression, "Grin and Bear It." Old
Aunt Polly evidently thought she was only
repeating the words of the Master Jesus, when
she uttered them, and doubtless that convic-
tion served to give the words themselves an
authority which enabled, or inspired, her
many a time, to "Grin and Bear It," when
nothing else she knew of could have given her
the courage to "Grin," without trying to "bear
it".
"Grin and Bear It." The verb "to bear", as
used in this expression, means to endure. That
is the spirit in which the Stoic faces hard-
ships, obstacles, and suffering. He merely en-

dures them with as little outward show of feel-

"bear" the trials and difficulties of life be-
cause they are inevitable, and he must meet
them in any event. While this is all right as
far as it goes, it does not go far enough to meet
the demands of evolving Individual Intelli-
gence. He must learn to endure in such an at-
titude that he shall not be cast down in spirit.
The verb "to bear" meaning "to endure"
represents a static condition and attitude of be-
ing. One may endure a sorrow or hardship and
at the same time remain in status quo—the
same position. Then again, one may "grin"
without feeling any sense of mirth. He may
grin because of his determination to endure
something which he knows is going o be diffi-
cult to bear. The word "grin," means "to draw
back the lips and show one's teeth". One may
do this because he is suffering great pain. He
may grin because he is so angry he might bite,
if he could, the thing that enrages him—as a
dog grins when he is ready to tear an enemy
with his teeth.

Does this mean the same as "Grin and Bear

Observe that it expresses two distinct atti-
tudes. The first is the attitude which produces
a smile upon the face. The second is that of a
fixed purpose to keep moving. Smile and keep
moving.
When I was a young man in college, my
classmates did me the honor to elect me as
their poet.
After laboring all my spare time for over a
month, I had not been able to decide upon a
subject. I wanted to write about a theme that
would be worthy of my classmates. I wanted
also to write something that would be out of
the beaten path of all the class poems I had
ever heard. But what should I write about?
And what should I write about it when 1 had
decided on my subject?
In the midst of these perplexities, Time was
passing all too swiftly. I had only a week left.
I must decide on something, and get to work,
writing. Two nights before my "poem" was
due, I fell asleep while still thinking what I
should write about. In the midst of my sleep,
a venerable poet came to me. I can see him

now. Maybe he was my poetic "Muse". Who
knows? Anyway, he took a piece of chalk
from somewhere, went to a blackboard, and
wrote these words
:
GO ONI
Go on, go on, go on, go on,
Go on, go on, go on;
Go on, go on, go on, go on.
Go on, go on, Go On!
I knew at once that this was intended to
help me solve my problem. While I was re-
peating the words, I awakened. I got out of
bed and wrote the words as I saw them upon
the board. The ancient Poet, (or Muse) look-
ed at me with a smile on his venerable face
and said : "There you are." Instantly he dis-
appeared. He had written my "Class Poem"
for me; and two evenings later I read it to my
classmates and the public, at the closing ex-
ercises of that year.
To me, the meaning and intent of the "po-

did heed the message. I was striving to reach
a certain goal toward which I had been trav-
eling from my early childhood. I knew the
goal; and I knew there were all manner of
difficulties to be overcome between me and it.
But I got the spirit of the poem as my inspira-
tion and determination to "Go On". And I
am still Going On.
In the years that have come and gone since
then, I have analyzed the spirit of that Class
Poem many times; and I find that it means
just one thing only. That is: it means first to
fix upon a definite goal you want to reach,
and then keep "going on" in that direction un-
til you arrive at your goal. This calls for noth-
ing but Courage and Determination to "Go
On". It means to let nothing, however diffi-
cult, keep you from Going On. But, to me,
that was not enough. It left no room for the
joy of living and achieving. To reach the
goal, and reach it in such a manner and spirit
that one may experience an active joy in trav-
eling the road, however long and difficult, one
must "Go On" with a smile in his eyes and a
song of joy on his lips.

It was this thought that made me realize
I5
SELF-UNFOLDMENT
that my poem was greatly lacking in its real
spirit. Whilst it might be all right to "Go On",
the mere matter of going forward has little in
it of true inspiration. One must be able to
keep himself in a bright and cheerful frame
of mind, if he would keep the journey from
becoming a drag and a hardship. He must
come to realize that life is something more
than simply Going On. It means to be able
to Smile and Go On.
In what way does this sentiment differ from
that of "Grin and Bear It"?
The sentiment of "Grin and Bear It", is
more that of enduring trials and hardships
without advertising our feelings to others.
The sentiment embodied in "Smile and Go
On", is that of keeping a bright and cheerful
attitude, while one is ever going forward to-
ward the goal of his endeavors.
Whatever may be the hardships or difficul-
ties of your life, accept them as a part of the
day's work, and bear them with equanimity;
and above all, do not weaken nor become dis-
couraged. Control your tendency to give up;
and keep an outward expression of pleasure
in your work.

that, as such, you are endowed with the power

Those of us who have any tendency in this
direction, should go back and read Bunyan's
"Pilgrim's Progress;" and make a special
study of the character therein who was for-
ever finding fault with the conditions of his
life; and making it extremely unpleasant for
all his fellow travelers, by making it appear
that his burdens were far heavier than theirs;
and that God was discriminating against him
unjustly. To test this accusation, he and all
his fellow travelers were called together and
asked to lay down their several burdens in a
row, where each one could see and examine
and weigh them all, with the privilege of ex-
changing his own burden for that of any
other Individual which it seemed to him
would be lighter and easier to carry.

win friendly sympathy from friends and asso-

who are to enjoy your society.

THINKING
Do you know just what you mean when you
say you are thinking, or have been thinking?
Have you ever tried to define the word? If
not, it might be an excellent thing for you if
you would make the attempt and the effort.
You would find it no insignificant task. You
would also find common usage gives to the
word almost a multitude of different mean-
ings. It hardly seems possible that so many
differing concepts could grow out of the same
word, or the same fundamental idea. Under
these circumstances it would seem possible
that some of us may be somewhat confused in
our metaphysics and psychology on the sub'
ject.
It is generally conceded by the recognized
authorities that thinking is a definite process.
It is agreed also that it is a positive and active
process. It involves the exercise of all the fac-

Intelligence. It requires that all these must be

whom they belong.
Even perception (which is recognized by
the authorities as a receptive faculty) could
not function if Individual Consciousness vs^ere
submerged in profound sleep. Consciousness
must therefore be kept awake, during the
process of thinking. This state of wakefulness
can be maintained only by and through the
exercise of the active Power of Will. The In-
dividual Intelligence must exercise that Pow-
er of Will. Hence, perception is part of the
process of thinking^
But an Individual Intelligence may per-
ceive a thing without invoking the active
process of thinking. That is to say, through
the sense of sight you may perceive the fact
that a drop of water is on your window-pane.
You may not reason upon that fact; you may
not exercise your judgment upon it; in which
event you are not thinking about it. You only
perceive the fact.

You cannot think about anything without
imagining that thing; you cannot imagine that
thing without its making an impression upon
your Consciousness. That which images the
thing is your imagination. And this is true
with anything you think about; whether it be
a physical object, an idea, or a subject of
thought. Hence, Imagination is involved in
the process of thinking.
There is another process which psycholo-
gists call meditation. They have left the lexi-

themselves have treated the subject, and ex-

most entirely a negative and receptive process,
from the standpoint of Individual Intelli-

you will continue to sit, in this same attitude

to come to your consciousness many new ideas,

these as it comes. Do not doubt it. Do not

The result is that they do not convey to us the

that when his student had succeeded to the
point where he was not conscious of anything
but the shining object, he could, by the exer-
cise of his own Will over the subject's mag-
netism, obtain complete control of the stu-
dent's faculties, capacities, and powers, and
compel him to do whatever he commanded.
He could hold the subject under his own con-
trol, and compel him, by the power of Will
alone, to do whatever he told him to do.
His experiments proved conclusively the
fact that the practice of passive concentration,
as hereinbefore suggested, is a destructive
process, and serves only to open the door to
the subjective condition, and make possible
the complete hypnotic subjugation of the
Will, voluntary powers, and sensory organism
of the subject to the absolute control of the
Will of the hypnotist.

subjectivity. It is the attitude of the man who

cise of his own Will over the subject's mag-
netism, obtain complete control of the stu-
dent's faculties, capacities, and powers, and
compel him to do whatever he commanded.
He could hold the subject under his own con-
trol, and compel him, by the power of Will
alone, to do whatever he told him to do.
His experiments proved conclusively the
fact that the practice of passive concentration,
as hereinbefore suggested, is a destructive
process, and serves only to open the door to
the subjective condition, and make possible
the complete hypnotic subjugation of the
Vill, voluntary powers, and sensory organism
of the subject to the absolute control of the
Will of the hypnotist.
"Tuning in" is yet another attitude of In-
telligence which many do not understand or
appreciate-which has a strong tendency to
subjectivity. It is the attitude of the man who
goes about "getting things out of t/ze air." He
35
SELF-UNFOLDMENT
really believes that he does actually "get many
things out of the air." Maybe he does. It
would not be remarkable if he does; because
he has reached a condition of "sensitiveness"
to many things of which the normal Individ-
ual is wholly unconscious. His attitude is
that of intense susceptibility to impressions of
all kinds. He does not realize the fact that
by cultivating such a sensitive susceptibility
he is opening the door to his own subjection.
Nevertheless he is doing just that. In such
an attitude he does not think. If he were re-
ally thinking he would not be able to "get
things out of the air," nor would so many ev-
anescent things make an impression upon his
consciousness.
Remember : Thinking involves the volun-
tary exercise of all the faculties, capacities,
and powers of the Individual Intelligence by
the Intelligence doing the thinking. This ac-
tive^ intelligent process calls for attention upon
the subject of thought to the exclusion of
everything else. One who is actively thinking
is using his own intelligent faculties, capaci-
ties, and powers so intently as to close his con-
sciousness to impressions from other sources.

Thinking is the remedy for all these nega-

Real thinking is that process of the Individ-

trols the activities of all its faculties, capaci-

While you are actively thinking, You are in
control of all these faculties, capacities, and
pow^ers. You are not negative nor passive in
relation to any of them. You are neither
simply meditating, concentrating, introspect-
ing, day-dreaming, "going into the silence,"
"tuning in," nor surrendering any of your in-
telligent faculties, capacities, or powers to the
control of any other Intelligence than your
own.
You are the Master of your own Soul and
the Autocrat of your own destiny.

2. When you waken in the morning, set your
mind actively to work at constructive thinking
along a definite line. The first moments of
waking, between sleep and physical activity,
often are moments spent in day dreaming,
allowing the thoughts to ramble along indef-
inite, hazy meanderings. In this process, a
leakage of magnetism occurs, so by the time
physical activity begins, already the system
is depleted and it is "hard to get up."
3. Keep the consciousness ever active and
alert against this depleting habit. From the
first moment of waking begin your work of
mental activity along organized, controlled
channels.
4. Throughout the day, stop long enough
from your labors to check on how much act-

be shocked and surprised to find how often
you indulge in mental rambles, day dreams,

What a horrid subject. Who wants to read

makes one feel old and decrepit. Women all
over the world are having their faces "lifted"
for the express purpose of removing their
Wrinkles.
An ancient American Indian, said to be
134 years young, became so covered with deep
wrinkles that he decided to be in the fashion,
and went to a specialist "Lifter" to have his
face "lifted". A typical American wag is said
to have circulated the report that the lifting
process called for the taking up of so much
"slack", to remove all the wrinkles, that the
operator, to shorten the process and save much
valuable time, simply removed the old fel-
low's scalp, drew up the skin so the edges of
the wound would meet on top of his skull,
and sewed the edges together like lacing a

Here is another item of knowledge that
should be treasured for its worth:
It is never too late to begin the all-impor-
tant work of Character-building.
And as rapidly as the real character is im-
proved, its improvement will reflect in the
face. You will be surprised to learn that you
can change the directions of the lines in your
face, by improving your real character.
This has been proven over and over by ac-
tual experience. A man of fifty who had
brought many perpendicular and ugly wrin-

He succeeded. By the time he was fifty-five
years old, he had removed from his face every
perpendicular wrinkle. The deep wrinkles be-

corners of his mouth, the long, deep wrinkles

Here is another item of knowledge that
should be treasured for its Worth:
It is never too late to begin the al1-impor-
tant work of Character-building.
And as rapidly as the real character is im-
proved, its improvement will reflect in the
face. You will be surprised to learn that you
can change the directions of the lines in your
face, by improving your real character.
This has been proven over and over by ac-
tual experience. A man of fifty who had
brought many perpendicular and ugly Wrin-
kles into his face by the process of imperfect
and defective character building, came to un-
derstand that he alone was responsible for the
disligurement of his face. He resolved to re-
move the evidences of these defects from his
face by rebuilding himself a more perfect and
more beautiful Character.
He succeeded. By the time he was fifty-five
years old, he had removed from his face every
perpendicular wrinkle. The deep wrinkles be-
tween his eyes above the bridge of his nose
(perpendicular), the drooping wrinkles at the
corners of his mouth, the long, deep wrinkles
running down the sides of his nose, were all

gone; and in their places were rapidly grow-
ing horizontal Wrinkles.
The best of this experience, however, was
in the fact that the man had actually changed
his disposition from that of an irritable, sullen,
nervous grouch, to that of a bright, cheerful,
and friendly disposition. His friends and as-
sociates did not hesitate to commend him for
his much improved Character and disposi-
tion.
Nature is always consistent; and you can
depend upon her to give you exactly what you
earn, at all times. If you have built for your-
self a beautiful Character, Nature will record
that fact in your face; and she will make it
so plain that the whole world shall see and
recognize you at your real worth.
One of the most beautiful, charming, and
altogether lovely faces the writer has ever seen
was that of an elderly woman past 60. The ex-
pression of her face was so delightful that it
reminded one of the sunlight laughing and
peeping through fleecy, fleeting clouds in the
sky. It gave one the distinct impression that
she was bubbling over with merriment and

When men and women learn that they can

some wrinkles are beautiful and others are

They will spend their time and effort in

When humanity has reached that point in

CONSCIENCE AND CONSISTENCY
Every Individual should be interested in
the subject of "Conscience". It is hoped, and
believed, that each one has a Conscience; and
that he or she will develop it to a point where
it will prove to be a safe and reliable guide to
conduct in all the afifairs of his life. To that
end it may help us if we can obtain a satisfac-
tory understanding of what Conscience is.
Here is about all the lexicologists of the
world have been able to tell us of the subject:
Conscience, as a mere word, is derived from
the Latin "Conscire"—which means to know.
But, as a term which has a deep psychological
significance, here is what they tell us:
1. Sense, or consciousness, of the moral
goodness or blameworthiness of one's own
conduct, intentions, or character, together
with a feeling of obligation to do or be that
which is recognized as good. Hence, a fac-
ulty, power, or principle, conceived to decide

It is that innate (inborn) knowledge which

Conscience might also be defined as: That

It is that within us which enables us to
know Right from Wrong, in their relation to
ourselves, our thoughts, and our actions. This
implies a knowledge of moral values. It also
means that one who has such a knowledge

a Moral Order in Nature; and that he is Mor-

under that Moral Order.
Certain poetically inclined Individuals
have said that "Conscience is the Voice of the

a contralto, an alto, a soprano, a lyric soprano,

It is no longer a safe guide to Individual ac-

A phase of the subject of Conscience ob-
trudes itself upon those who have had oppor-

class as "criminals." There are those,
even among the most learned of these
students, who believe sincerely that all
crime is the direct result of defective

those among the most learned criminologists
who seem to believe that crime is the result
of uncontrolled inclinations to violate man-

Both of these classes of criminologists are
able to produce a vast amount of evidence in
support of their respective conclusions.
So far, however, the subject remains a

It seems to be quite generally acknowl-

percentage of all criminals are without Con-

One element in the definition of Conscience
must not be overlooked in this connection; and
that is the term ^^normal." An Individual Hu-
man Intelligence may be unable to function
normally. We may have all seen such
Individuals. Any case of insanity is a
perfect illustration of an Individual Intelli-
gence that is not normal. Such an Individual
is moved to action almost entirely by his emo-
tions. His Intelligent powers and capabilities
may be unable to function solely because of a
defective instrument, the physical brain. Such
a defective instrument of expression may be-
come normal again, and the ability again to
express his knowledge of Right and Wrong
is thus restored. On the other hand, the na-
ture of the defect may be such that it may not
be repaired during this physical life time,
in which event he remains "abnormal" and
insensible to his Conscience.
Another question which is more than likely
to arise in the minds of certain thinkers is
with reference to children. If Conscience is an

You will note the fact that knowledge is
the foundation upon which Conscience is
built But knowledge is an evolving and pro-
gressive attainment. It comes from experience,
and is not acquired in a lump sum, all at one
time. It grows—and growth takes Time.
In infancy and early childhood, the Indi-

of Moral problems. Right and Wrong are
distinctly within the realm of Morality.
Hence, only time and experience can develop

Here is a phenomenon, in this connection,
which has commanded the interest and con-

It is a notable fact that there is a vast dif-
ference among children of the same physical
age, in their knowledge of Right and Wrong;
which makes a vast difference in the develop-
ment of their Consciences.
This might be accounted for in two dif-
ferent ways:

physical environment of one child may all be
of a highly Moral character; from which the
child may develop its Conscience much more
rapidly than another child of the same age.

A jewel is something of great value. More-

Consistency, therefore, is a rare jewel only be-
cause it so infrequently exists among human-

In other words, if it were the rule to find
men and women living their lives in conform-
ity with their religious or philosophic beliefs,
and in accordance with the dictates of their
Conscience, the importance of Consistency—
as one of the exalted virtues among humanity
—would decrease accordingly.
But inasmuch as we find the element of
Consistency among humanity to exist so rare-
ly, we give it an importance commensurate
with its rarity. Hence, it has come to be re-

I am painfully aware that these facts do
not exalt the moral tendency of the evolution-

It was not merely faith alone, in the abstract,

the Master said : "Thy Faith". It was not
His faith, nor the faith of Peter, John, or

who gathered about the Master. He said
"Thy" faith. And just what does this mean?
It means that it was the faith of the patient
herself that gave the faith the one specific
ingredient necessary to make it constructively
fruitful. And reducing this fact to its exact

be, the faith of the patient; quite as much
as that of the healer—and in many instances

nor "moral character", as the term is so often
employed in consideration of moral and eth-

In the process of healing through faith, the

the positive to the receptive condition to mag-

sponge^ as it were, and becomes a powerful
absorbent of vital magnetism from its envi-

fact that whatever awakens in one a sublime
faith that he is going to be healed, and fully

labor to make the Temple of your Soul a
beautiful and perfect abiding place for its
occupant-wherein, with joy and gladness,
to serve the Living God and all his Children;
and you open the doors to the "Wrecking
Crew" and invite them in to deface, Wreck,
and destroy everything the Builders have
done to make for you an abiding place of joy
and satisfaction. Don't do it.
Every Individual should learn how to de-
velop within himself the healing power of
therapeutic faith, by the exercise of which he
may, at any time, open the Hood-gates of con-
structive and vital energy and restore his phys-
ical body to perfect harmony with the Law of
Health. But in the exercise of this knowledge
and power, he is only restoring his physical
body to a condition of normality which, by
the exercise of the same degree and quality of
92
FAITH
faith, never would have become "abnormal".
In other words, if the Individual were taught
to develop within himself the faith that cures,
and to apply that faith to the prevention of
disease, his body would never become de-
ranged by disease. In that event, he would
avoid all the suffering, pain, and agony of
disease, because there would be no diseased
condition of his body.
But the greatest single cause of disease lies
in the fact that men and women, while free
from disease and its consequent suffering, give
little or no attention to, or consideration of,
the subject or the fact of disease. It does not
seem to them to be a matter of importance un-
til disease has deranged the body and brought
to the Individual tortures of physical suffer-
ing. Then the Soul cries out: "If I had only
known, I might have avoided all this agony
and torture." Then, for the first time, he re-
alizes the fact that disease is but a penalty
which Nature fixes upon the Individual. Then
only does he enter upon the sublime search for
the path that will lead him back into the
broad highway which will restore him to,
health.

mind travel over the place that Faith holds
in the economy of God's plan, as exemplified
in Nature.

CHAPTER VI
THE HEALTH ATTITUDE
One of the great struggles of humanity to-
, day is the struggle for physical health. This
is not to be wondered at; because they know
from experience that they live in their phys-
ical bodies. They know that physical disease
is a most disagreeable and often distressing
thing to experience.
They h ave come to think of health and dis-
ease as purely physical problems. In this,
however, they are to be pitied for their ig-
norance. Neither health nor disease is ex-
clusively a physical problem. Neither is it
exclusively a physical thinrf. Indeed, if all
the facts could be put in evidence, it would
be found that, in the great aggregate of re-
sults, both health and disease, even of the phys-
ical body, are far more la psychicaf] (often
calledjmgwM/) I problem than a physical one.

This is intended to convey the thought that
the attitude of Soul, or the ^'condition of
mind/' as the expression is so often used, may
be—and often is—the direct cause of diseases
and physical derangements of various kinds.
It follows with the certainty of absolute logic,
that since a wrong attitude of Soul, or condi-
tion of mind, can cause disease, a right atti-
tude of Soul, or condition of mind, should
cure it, and thereby cause health. Is not this
good logic? It.jj not only good logic, but itis

there is no attitude of Soul, or condition of

admit that the sensation is not enjoyable. You
will not hesitate to accept such Fear as a de-

most destructive. Sudden shocks of great
_fear have been known to react upon the heart
with such violence as to stop its action and
produce almost instant death. The sensation
in the solar plexus often produces violent

sometimes follows, showing the destructive
nature of the emotion we call "Fear". The

of the entire system, and in some cases violent
illness.
One of the common results of great fear is
to stop all elimination from the body. The
kidneys are especially susceptible to this emo-
tion. And they do not have to stop their elim-

distributed uric acid poisoning throughout the

FAITH AND WORKS
In its religious aspects Faith has exercised
a broader, deeper, and more powerful influ-
ence, during the Christian era, than the world
in general has realized. It is today, as it has
been since the religion of Jesus Christ had its
birth, the background and main support of
all that is included in "The Christian Re-
ligion", regardless of its denominational vari-
ations.
At one time the entire Christian civilization
was shaken to its foundation by a profound
doctrinal discussion as to the possibility of
''Salvation by Faith alone". There were many
learned disputants who held that the words of
the Master himself established the full power
and sufliciency of Faith alone when he said :
"For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
him should not perish, but have everlastiny
life."

But there have been many also who have
based their conviction upon the teachings of
James, who says: 2, 14—"What doth it profit,
my brethern, though a man say he hath faith,
and have not works? Can faith save him? 2,
17; Even so faith, // // hath not works, is dead,
being alone. 2, 24; Ye see then how that by
works man is justified, and not by faith alone."
While this disputed point left its mark up-
on the souls of men, and led to many divisions
in the Christian churches, it seems to have es-
tablished the point upon which all agree,
namely, that Faith is essential to those who
seek salvation and eternal life.
But there is something vastly more worthy
of our consideration, as to the value and ef-
ficacy of Faith in the great scheme of Indi-
vidual Life, and the relation of Individual
Life to the Creator of all life.
And this brings us face to face with the

"No."

When an Individual has taken these two
vital and essential steps in preparation for the
definite Work ahead of him, he has laid the
substantial foundation upon which to build
the exalted superstructure of the Temple of
his Individual Character. Then only can he
say, in all truth, that he is "duly and truly

the next "Regular Step" in his evolutionary
journey toward the goal of his endeavors.
But what does it mean to the Individual to

It means to him that he has conquered one
of the most powerful and destructive "Lions

never again will it lie in wait for him, in the
hope of catching him off guard, and thus over-

his Individual Character. Then only can he
say, in all truth, that he is "duly and truly
prepared, worthy, and well qualified" to take
the next "Regular Step" in his evolutionary
journey toward the goal of his endeavors.
But what does it mean to the Individual to
complete such a preparation? And why is it so
vitally essential?
It means to him that he has conquered one
of the most powerful and destructive "Lions
on the Way"-the Lion of Fear; and that,
never again will it lie in wait for him, in the
hope of catching him of? guard, and thus over-
coming him. It means that never again will he
suffer the agony of Fear when he is brought
face to face with the transition through the
"Valley of the Shadow" of Death. It means
that henceforth he will look upon physical
l-
SELF-UNFOLDMENT
death as but a natural and beneficent transi-
tion which opens the way for him to accom-
plish his own Individual Evolutionary Un-
foldment along constructive lines, until he
finally arrives at the goal of his own Self-Com-
pletion, Nature's reward for which is his own
Individual Happiness.
Is there anything in such a prospect that
should impel one to look upon it with fear,
dread, repugnance, or horror? On the other
hand, every Individual who has arrived at a
clear understanding of the problem of Indi-
vidual life, should carry securely within his
inmost consciousness a realization of the fact
—for it is a fact—that whenever, and wher-
ever, and however the "Angel of Death" shall
come to him in the natural course of events
—
and without his own connivance or invitation
—it will come as a cherished friend and not as
a fearful and hateful enemy. And this is be-
cause it is a necessary step in the progress of
the human Soul along the pathway of Indi-
vidual Evolution, and a transition without
which no human Soul could ever arrive at its
Individual destiny nor justly hope for Indi-
vidual Happiness.

FAITH AND WORKS
The one great, uplifting, and impelling pur-
pose of the Great School, at this time, is to in-
spire humanity with the Faith that sustains
the Soul in the goodness and the sufficiency of
the Creative Intelligence through every duty,
every responsibility, every trial, every hard-
ship, every sorrow, every failure, every tra-
gedy of human life—because of his assurance
and absolute conviction that all these are but
the transitory, ephemeral, and impermanent
experiences of the Individual, incident to his
permanent development and Soul Growth.
Through this seeming tangle of these fleet-
ing and fugitive experiences, the Individual
Intelligence finds its way to the "peace that
passeth understanding", and to the perma-
nent and enduring happiness with which Nat-
ure rewards his Faith in the righteousness of
her decrees.
Why do we admire an optimist and despise
the pessimist? It is because the one inspires
faith in success, and in the beneficent results of
all honest eflfort; while the other would cast
the shadow of doubt, disbelief, unrest, dis-
satisfaction, hopelessness, and gloom over all
mankind, regardless of his honest endeavors.

of the Creative Intelligence and in the right-

in the justice of His Laws, is fixed and un-
wavering—and you will observe that he is a
living exemplification of Tolerance, Self-Con-

Law of Compensation, and the assurance that
all is well with the world. Wherever he goes,
he sheds the bright radiance of Hope, the up-

Tranquillity and the benign influence of a

INTELLECTUAL VANITY
Intellectual Vanity is one of the most de-
structive characteristics of human nature.
While it is universal in scope, it is especially
found among the masculine element of human
nature, although it is not at all uncommon
among the feminine element.
The manner in which it is generally con-
sidered does not make of it a matter of much
importance. This, perhaps, is because it is
such a universal characteristic. Among men
particularly it comes, or has come, to be ac-
cepted as a matter of course, and therefore
as a thing to be accepted as a "necessary evil",
rather than one that may be overcome and thus
disposed of.
The chief difficulty the average Individual
finds in his efforts to analyze himself on
the subject, is to realize that he is afflicted
with it at all. Almost every man who has come

has concluded that he is either free from In-
tellectual Vanity, or comparatively so. And
the majority of women "just know" they are.
Whereas the fact is that the vast majority of
men and women are afflicted with it to some
degree or another, and many of them are
sorely and distressingly so.
Intellectual Vanity is unjustifiable admira-
tion of one's own Intelligence or intellectual
attainments. It impels one to seek the admira-
tion and the applause of others in regard to
his intellectual brilliancy, rational powers,
wit, humor, judgment, knowledge, and intel-
lectual superiority over others.
It is an expression of selfishness which will
be gratified regardless of anybody and any-
thing. It leaves no room for thoughtful con-
sideration of others. It is all for its own
glorification, pleasure, and gain.
One writer has aptly stated : "Vanity, Self-
ishness, Greed, Dishonesty, Immorality. That
tells the entire story in all its simplicity."
This brief picture of the way of Vanity may
seem to be exaggerated, but where Vanity is a
predominant fault in an Individual, it often
will be found that this is the way he travels.

INTELLECTUAL VANITY
There is no question to a student of char-
acter that Vanity, in any form, is destructive
to Individual Unfoldment and development;
and it is destructive to any work with which
the vain Individual is associated. Therefore, it
is well to consider it from the standpoint of
elimination and substitution.
Let us consider some of the most obvious
phases of Intellectual Vanity.
Boastfulness
Most people recognize the fact that boast-
fulness of speech and manner are a clear in-
dication of vanity. But I have found that it is
not every person who has a clear understand-
ing of what constitutes boastfulness—especi-
ally in himself. He sees it with almost abnor-
mal clearness of vision, when it is manifested
by someone else.
There is scarcely any phase, or manifesta-
tion of Vanity that is more obnoxious than is
that of boastfulness. Nor is there any element
of human character that more radically mis-
represents a wholesome Attitude of Soul, or,
Intelligence.

him, what he is, what he knows, inevitably
thrusts his own personality to the foreground
and obscures everything and everybody else.
With such a man the desire to exploit himself
takes precedence over any issue, or any cause,
or any person. It is absolutely impossible for
such a person to be loyal to any cause or to any
Individual. He lives only in the psychologi-
cal environment of the pronoun "I". All else
is secondary.
It is almost, if not quite, as impossible for
the boastful Individual to be discreet; such a
person is almost universally voluble, and the
one who "talks too much" is sure to say a good
many things which ought to remain unsaid.
Dogmatism.
The one who is intellectually vain is not
only boastful, but in most instances is dog-
matic as well.
Whether or not in his inmost Soul he really
thinks so, he nevertheless carries the impres-
sion that his word must not be questioned.

Those who do not agree with him are put

This is another sure evidence of Intellectual
Vanity. It is a decidedly destructive agency
and element in the pathway of constructive
growth. There is, perhaps, no phase or mani-
festation of Vanity which m/jrepresents the
spirit of Self-Unfoldment and Self-Mastery
more radically nor destructively than that of
a critical attitude toward one's fellowmen and
women.
Volubility
"Talking too much" is another of the in-
evitable manifestations of Intellectual Vanity.
The man who talks incessantly, does so be-

those who interrupt or fail to listen with rapt

Unfortunately, however, the man of many
words is invariably the man of few original
ideas. He talks fluently, only because he ap-

The two characteristics do not go together.

that so much attention is given to "discretion"

aspiring toward that goal.

It is possible for a highly intelligent Indi-

abnormal proportions that it actually blinds
him to the fact that he is a conspicuous victim
of it.
It would seem virtually impossible that such
a condition could exist in any sane man or

I have witnessed just such a development of
Egotism, Intolerance, Dogmatism, and Self-

When we follow the subject back to its

and foundation in Intellectual Vanity.
This fact has caused much difficulty among
people in their efforts to help their friends, or

It is one of the established principles of

If Sensitiveness or Wounded Vanity pre-

Any Individual, who cannot face himself

Even though he may feel that he is not fully

Obtrusiveness
One of the most unmistalcable evidences

toward Women as in any other w^ay.
A vain man invariably depreciates women.
He betrays the fact constantly that he has
little or no respect for the intelligence of wo-

in most instances in every sense of the word.
His vanity is oflFended if they do not recognize
his self-assumed superiority and pay him def-

the presence of women. He never listens to
them, except when he is the subject of their

Men and women should be Companions in

They should look upon each other as equals,
and treat each other in the same way. They

However, it is a real and a difficult labor to

Perhaps you have never thought of Timid-
ity as an expression of Vanity; but study it
from that angle in this connection. It is a
phase of Fear. Fear of w^hat? Fear on the
part of the Individual that he will fail to make
a good impression, or that he will not give a
good representation of himself, or herself.
What is that but an indication of Vanity?
Timidity, in this case, is a combination of
Fear and Vanity.
One of the stumbling blocks in the way of
mutual understanding between men and wo-
men is the timidity of women in the presence
of men. Usually when women meet together
without men they are a perfect cyclone of
talk. There is little timidity or backwardness
among them; and they express themselves as
fluently, gracefully, logically, and intelligent-
ly as men. But very frequently you will find
that the moment a man is admitted into their
circle they become as silent and as dumb as a

Mind now, I have not said this is always
true. I said frequently it is so.
There are men and women who manifest
their weakness of Intellectual Vanity in the
positive, aggressive forms and phases; there
are other men and women who manifest it in
the passive, non-aggressive forms and phases.
But, in general, it will be found that the pos-

THE CRITICAL ATTITUDE

words to turn the Search-Light of Conscience
upon himself, or herself, as the case may be;
and, under the X-ray of Rational Intelligence,
locate every fracture or lesion in his or her
Mental and Moral Constitution.
By Critical Attitude is meant the attitude
of finding fault with and cruelly picking to
pieces the lives and characters of our fellow-
men.
While criticism is found, in general, among
both men and women, it is, perhaps, more
specifically a characteristic and habit found
in the women. For some reason or other, it
seems to give women a satisfaction and pleas-
ure to pick out the faults and defects of others'
characters, even though these others may be
their own friends, associates, or even members
of their families. It seems to be an alluring,

of human nature. And this is deeply regret-

character as to definitely mar its beauty.
Criticism is one of the most destructive fac-

It involves disloyalty, intolerance, and the
practice of judging one's fellowmen —which
no Individual has a moral right to do. Every
human Intelligence is charged by God, or Na-
ture, with the obligation to live his life ac-
cording to his own standard of Equity, Jus-
tice, and Right. Each Individual's standard is
dififerent, according to his degree of knowl-
edge and development. Thus it stands to reas-
on that no one Individual can understand, ap-
preciate, nor govern the standard of any other
Individual, because he is in no position to
know what it is.

many centuries ago by one of the Wise Masters
of The Great School, in Chaldea. It seems to
have been rediscovered by one of our modern
psychologists, who expressed it somewhat af-
ter this fashion
:
'*The critical attitude of mind arises nat-
urally from the consciousness of one's own un-
worthiness. The Individual who finds pleas-
ing employment in criticizing those with
whom he associates, thereby—if he did but
know it—advertises his own imperfections of
character and demonstrates the justice of his
own condemnation."
In this connection a strange discovery has
been made—that the Individual who seems to
consider it a mark of distinction to be con-
sidered ''critical", almost universally sees in
his associates the very faults and defects of
character which most deeply mar the beauty
of his oivn character.
In other words, it seems to be a law of life,
that we are able to see most clearly in others
the flaws that are most glaring in ourselves.
We see in others the reflection of those faults
and defects which predominate in ourselves.

Stated in another form—to the "critical"
Individual, his associates are but so many
mirrors wherein he sees most vividly reflected
the flaws, defects, faults, and deformities of
his own character.
Therefore, every time an Individual in-
dulges in criticism he betrays his own faults,
defects, smallness, and narrowness of charac-
ter. Not a very pleasant thought, is it?
When a critical Individual indulges in this
destructive pastime, consciously or uncon-
sciously he assumes an attitude of self-right-
eousness and does his criticizing from an ele-
vated and exalted angle. He may do this un-
consciously; but at the same time he derives
gratification from the self-righteous attitude
and in feeling himself better than and above
the other person.
The Critical Attitude might be likened to
that species of worm which bores its way into
the hearts of plants, destroys the vital, inte-
grating centers, and finally kills them. The
essential lives of the plants are eaten out and
destroyed by the worm.
Criticism accomplishes the very same thing
in the human Soul, or Intelligence.

THE CRITICAL ATTITUDE
The critical Individual begins by critici-
zing the dominant traits of another's charac-
ter. He may do this, assuming, and perhaps
believing, that he is "analyzing the character."
The footing is gained. The process of "bor-
ing" is begun. Gradually, and perhaps un-
consciously, he continues the "analyzing"
process, boring deeper and deeper, continuing
on and on, until eventually he bores into the
personal interests and affairs of his victim.
He loses sight of any constructive motive. He
progresses in his boring process. Then he be-
gins to find fault with everything the Indi-
vidual says or does. He exaggerates and places
a wrong construction on all the Individual's
words and actions, until his own soul becomes
filled with resentment and discord. The worm
of criticism has bored its way into the Soul.
Then begins the eating process.
The critical person begins to dwell on the
faults of his fellow associates, enlarging and
exaggerating them until he no longer can see
any good in their characters. The more he
thinks of, and dwells on, the associate's faults
and defects, the more resentful, irritable, and
critical the Individual becomes. This attitude

continues until he finds himself unable to con-

his worm-eaten soul. He becomes disagree-

He does not hesitate to pass judgment upon all
who come within the range of his observation,

The wise mother knows of the dangers, be-
cause she has lost a beloved husband and three
sons, who endeavored to travel the same jour-
ney. But, true to her philosophy of "All is
good, and there is no danger"—she bids her
boy goodbye, and sends him off to sure death.
The question arises : Is she justified in thus
concealing the facts from an ignorant boy who
needs to know them in order to save his own
life?
It seems to me that any sane mother, father,
sister, or brother, who would permit a boy to
go forth into the world under such conditions,
witholding from him the facts of Nature,
however dangerous they may be, is nothing
short of criminal.
In the event of the boy's death, as a result
of their intentional concealment of the Facts
of Nature, who is responsible?
I should be glad to have anyone devote him-

The problem of Loyalty is one that has

General principles may be obtained and

the "inability" of women in these vitally es-

due to their unwillingness, rather than to their
inability to keep a secret or respect a confi-

While this statement is made, it is not meant
to convey that women alone are violators in
this regard. There are plenty of men who
also fail in this application of loyalty; but the
failure has seemed to be predominant among
women, in the past.
Then again, fear of secret, mysterious, or
unknown dangers is not a prominent ingred-

citizen. It is almost impossible to impress
men and women of this free and independent
country, with the idea that there ever is any

any work, or cause, or organization, as well

into all kinds of habits. Every habit is ac-
quired only through some form of Self-In-
dulgence. And it always makes one a slave
but never a Master of himself.
It must, therefore, be clear to you that it
stands directly in the way of Self-Mastery.
According to the Great School, Habit is
the result of the repetition of an indulgence,
until the desire for the indulgence overcomes
the willingness to withstand it, and the Indi-
vidual becomes a victim, of his own Self-In-
dulgence.
From this definition it will be observed
that there can be no good habits, just because
any habit overcomes the power of Will to
control it. Whatever destroys the independ-
ent power of Will is destructive to the Indi-
vidual. Self-indulgence overcomes the pow-
er of Will, and thus the Individual becomes
a subject to Self-indulgence.
When an Individual indulges in an estab-
lished act, and repeats the indulgence time
after time, without curbing, until the desire
for the indulgence overcomes his willingness
to control the desire, he becomes an uncon-
scious victim of his indulgence.

the Individual has become a victim to it. In
becoming a victim to it, he no longer uses his

extent that he becomes dependent upon it, in-
stead of independent.
Take, for instance, the case of an inveterate
smoker. How^ did he get that way? Very
likely, at some early stage in his life, he took
a dare to smoke, just to test himself. He en-
joyed the resulting sensation, and took another.
In his enjoyment he repeated the act, over and
over. This continued, on and on, and soon
he probably discovered that he had developed
a definite desire for smoking. The desire
continued to increase and become so strong
that it finally overpowered his willingness to
withstand it. Then he lost the ability to ex-
ert his Will Power sufficiently to control the
desire. And what was the result? He be-

consciously to follow along in the groove. The
longer he persists in it, the deeper the groove,
or rut, becomes. And with each following
in the rut, it becomes more and more difficult
for him to exert his Will Power and get him-
self out of it. He is like an automobile
that gets into a rut in a road. The first time
it gets into the rut it is not so difficult to pull
out. But if this happens time after time, the
rut grows deeper and deeper, and it becomes
increasingly difficult to develop sufficient
power in the automobile to pull it up and out.
So it is with the Individual. The rut he
gets into becomes so deep, and the effort to
get out so great, that he loses the desire to
exert the necessary Will Power and personal
effort to pull himself out.
Every time a habit is repeated, the powers
of resistance are weakened and the Will Pow-
er lessened. The Individual no longer main-
tains mastery over Self.
There are various kinds of habits. There
are so-called trivial ones, and there are ludi-
crous ones. There are some more destructive
than others. It is also true that some habits
are more obnoxious than destructive.

But every habit—whether trivial or ludi-
crous, obnoxious or repellant, inconsequent-
ial or destructive; whether more obnoxious
than destructive, or more destructive, per se,
than repellant—is a badge of servitude, just
the same.
It stands between the Individual Intelli-
gence and his Self-Unfoldment and Self-Mas-
tery.
So-called trivial, inconsequential, or ludi-
crous habits are dangerous in themselves.
While they might appear to mean nothing, so
far as the morality of the Individual is con-
cerned, nevertheless it is a fact that they are
dangerous, because they form the basis of
greater and more destructive habits. Today
they may be indifferent, inconsequential, lu-
dicrous. Tomorrow they may lead to positive,
destructive conditions. The little trivial hab-
its of today slowly but surely unfit the Indi-
vidual to cope with and withstand the greater,
more destructive habits of tomorrow. They
inevitably weaken his Will Power and his
power of resistance, and make of him a vic-
tim of Self-indulgence.
No one can ever achieve the goal of Self-

than repellant-is a badge of serfuitua'e, just
the same.
It stands between the Individual Intelli-
gence and his Self-Unfoldment and Self-Mas-
tery.
So-called trivial, inconsequential, or ludi-
crous habits are dangerous in themselves.
VVhile they might appear to mean nothing, so
far as the morality of the Individual is con-
cerned, nevertheless it is a fact that they are
dangerous, because they form the basis of
greater and more destructive habits. Today
they may be indifferent, inconsequential, lu-
dicrous. Tomorrow they may lead to positive,
destructive conditions. The little trivial hab-
its of today slowly but surely unfit the Indi-
vidual to cope with and withstand the greater,
more destructive habits of tomorrow. They
inevitably weaken his VVill Power and his
power of resistance, and make of him a vic-
tim of Self-Indulgence.
No one can ever achieve the goal of Self-

SELF-UNFOLDMENT
Unfoldment and Self-Mastery while there
yet remains in him a single habit (the result
of self-indulgence) to which he is a slave, or
over which he has not yet established absolute
and permanent mastery. All habits are the
result of Self-indulgence and constitute a dis-
tinct bar to unfoldment and progress; and
hence must be controlled by all who seek to
become demonstrators of the Law.
To appreciate this more fully, it is neces-
sary to know that Self-indulgence, in many
forms, is coarsening in its effects upon the tis-
sues of the physical body, as well as in its psy-
chical effect. Since Self-Unfoldment involves
a refining process all along the line, physic-
ally as well as psychically, it must be clear to
anyone (who is able to reason) that to one
who is seeking Self-Unfoldment and Self-
Mastery in accordance with the Principles
and Laws of Nature, it is a distinct obstacle
and a real detriment.
But it is not necessarily a crime, nor is it
necessarily a sin.

begin by reading the chapter on "Martyrdom"

Then let us apply the facts therein stated to
the Individual who is afflicted with the habits
of self-indulgence.
It is a Fact of Nature that there are thou-
sands on the lowest spiritual plane, and even
in the magnetic field, who have "over-indulg-
ed" in some habit or habits during their earth
life. They have passed into the other life
with their habit, or habits, thoroughly fixed
upon them.
In the life on the spiritual plane, they find
no means of gratifying their appetites or
"over-indulgences." They therefore seek the
associations of those yet upon the earth plane
who indulge in their particular "habit," and
by establishing the closest and most intimate
relations possible with them, they are enabled
to absorb some of the magnetism of the phys-
ically embodied man or woman, and thereby
obtain some of the efifects, which partially
relieves or gratifies their desires and cravings.

surroundings when he is in the midst of in-

a sufficient shock to cure him instantly and for-
ever, however completely he may have sur-
rendered to the habit heretofore.
The man or woman who over-indulges in
anything is universally followed, or accom-
panied, by as many spiritual victims of the
same habit as can crowd themselves into his
environment, or atmosphere. They do this
for the purpose of absorbing as much of the
results of the Individual's indulgence as they
can, to gratify their appetites, or cravings, or
desires.
The constant association enables the spirit-
ual habitue, in course of time, to establish
very close relations with the earthly indulgent.
And the same close association has enabled
spiritual Intelligences to develop the subject-
ive psychic relation in many cases.
The only way for an Individual to free him-
self from such a condition and relation is by
mastering any and all habits here and now.

Suppose one of your good friends who had
witnessed many manifestations and demonstra-

tell you plainly but kindly of your defect; and
for the purpose of impressing you, should tell
you what an ugly blot the defect made upon
your otherwise well-developed and rounded

feel grateful to him for his interest in you, and
for his friendly effort to help you? Or, would
you resent him for his "presumption"?
I once had what I believed to be a good
friend. He was an intelligent man; and, under
most circumstances, was a gentleman. He
made friends easily, but he lost them quickly.
He had more than one defect of character;
but there was one that overtopped all the
others so far that it obtruded itself upon the at-

personal contact. The marvel of it was that he
seemed to be utterly unconscious of his fault,
and quite as unconscious of the unfavorable
impression he made upon others.

It seemed too bad that any man of such
fundamental capabilities should have his
whole life and all its constructive possibil-

solely for the purpose of helping him, through
Self-Discipline, to wipe this ruinous blot from
his life and character, I resolved to see if I
could help, by calling his attention to the de-

the matter in his own hands and eliminate the
defect. I knew that it was a most delicate un-

quality of tact on my part; but I believed I
could reach his consciousness and understand-

I found that we agreed as to the essentials
of an ideal Character. We agreed also in the
the fact that we both earnestly desired to
build for ourselves such an ideal Character;
and that we would be most grateful to any
friend who would be of help to us along those
lines. We agreed that Egotism is one of the
most destructive and obtrusive defects of hu-

the most common. As you can see, this brought
the subject to a point where a natural opening
was made for me to call his attention to his

I said
:
"As one of your most loyal and aflfectionate
friends, may I tell you what I regard as your

to be of real service to him, I made an enemy;
for I learned later that he said some very bit-

This experience taught me a valuable les-

of human nature, th at even the_most glaring
defect of Character is the one which the In-
dividual himself never sees. In the case above
mentioned this must have been true; although
his egotism and vanity of Intelligence obtrud-
ed themselves upon every friend and acquaint-
ance the gentleman had.
Any Individual should accept an honest
and well-meant criticism from any friend as
one of the greatest benefits that could be be-
stowed upon him. It enables him to know how
others see him and estimate his character.
But what is the good of knowing one's de-
fects of Character, unless he desires and in-
tends to remedy them? The remedy calls for
Self-Discipline. Once you know that you have
a fault or defect of Character, you naturally
want to eliminate or remedy it. But how shall
you proceed to eliminate it or remedy it?
Only by Self-Discipline.
Character Building is a business in which
we are all engaged. But I cannot build your
character for you; neither can you build mine
for me. Each of us must do his own building.

This business is not like that of building
houses; for therein one man may build another
man's house. But in the business of Character
Building, Nature has so provided that no In-
dividual shall build another Individual's
character. This is because no Individual can
build another Individual's character.
This is just as true as it is that no man can
do another man's eating, sleeping, or growing;
and for the same reason—because Nature, or
the Great Creative Intelligence, has so de-
creed.
It is true, that in the course of the building
of my character, you may be able to see and
point out to me a weakness, fault, or defect;
but you cannot overcome the weakness, elim-
inate the fault, nor remedy the defect. That is
my business, as well as my responsibility.
But if I prefer to go along with a weak-

than make the efifort necessary to overcome the

tried. You couldn't get into it. You might

mine as you could; but that would not be
mine, nor would it be like mine.
But the problem in which you are especially
interested is this : How shall I proceed to the

you to discover your defect of Egotism; but
your accompanying studies have enabled you
to know what are the signs, indications, or
manifestations of Egotism, in any person so
afflicted. You know that it manifests itself by
an outward attitude of self-complacency; by
an attitude of superiority; by too much talking

immediately and talk of other things.

It will not be long until you will not have to
watch yourself so closely; because you will
soon be able to notice it every time you begin
to talk of yourself. Not only that, it will soon
become as obnoxious to you as it is to those who
have to listen to you. You will actually grow
to despise the habit of talking about yourself;

Principle of Life is that by which Nature has

What does this mean? It means this:
An obligation is a duty. It is something
imposed upon you which you are bound to do,
under penalty of punishment, in the event of
failure. To fix a thing means to make it per-
manent; to render it immovable. Therefore,
when Nature fixes upon you an obligation,
she places upon you a permanent duty, an
"immovable" duty which you are bound to
fulfil, or suffer heavy punishment therefor, in
case of failure.
Nature fixes upon you the obligation to
live your life according to your own standard
of Equity, Justice, and Right. This means
that you yourself must establish a standard

of meting out the great Principle of RIGHT,
