  		              		Experience Description 8841   

    I felt a headache and everything was blurry for a second.  I went dark.  I passed out. 

  When I woke up, I could see my body on the floor. I was standing right next it. It was like I was at two places at the same time. I was tired and could see my friends and the teachers standing around me.  They were trying to get me to breathe. A few moments later, I saw the paramedics come down the stairs. I can't remember very vividly, but I think they started CPR right away. I could see my girlfriend crying and wanting to know what was going on. One of the teachers was holding her. I tried to go near her, but I couldn't move.  So, I just stared a her for a few moments. When I went back to looking at my body, the paramedics were still giving me CPR. I could feel the paramedic's hand on my chest, pressing. I wanted to wake up, but I was too tired to do anything. I wanted to cry, but I was too tired and too weak to do so. I was thinking about my family and everything that I will miss if I couldn't come back to my body. I was thinking that this is it for my life. I was upset and mad because I didn't get the chance to say goodbye.  It was exactly like the time that I didn't get to say goodbye to my grandparents.

   For a moment, I felt like something touched my hand. I looked down a saw a little  boy, who was one or two years old. He could see me. It was a strange feeling; it was like I knew the child, perhaps he was my child? As soon as he touched my hand, it was like some sort of energy entered my body. I was not tired anymore and  I could move. I ran to my girlfriend,  talked to her and even  touched her, but she could see me,  hear me, or  feel me. I started crying; it was extremely painful. The little boy came to me again and held my hand while  pointing at my unconscious body. I saw the paramedics bringing the defibrillator paddles out. I was scared.  I looked at the child and he smiled at me; it was in that moment that I knew I had enough energy to go back to my body.

    I heard someone say, 'Hurry, she is going.' I started running and took a dive into my left thigh. I woke up, breathing really heavily; I was tired again, as if I had been running for hours. I saw the people around me. They were shocked and looked as if they had seen some sort of a miracle. I can't remember what happened after that. I woke up in the hospital.  When I asked the doctor why everyone was so shocked, the doctor told me that  the paramedics never used the defibrillator paddles. I woke up all on my own.'

                		Experience Description 8918:   

    A week before this happened, I had a minor car accident. The doctor said that I had a concussion, but nothing that I should worry about. A week later, I almost died.

   I remember standing in front of the cafeteria with some of my friends. Suddenly, I felt extreme dizziness,  lost my balance, and fell on the ground. I think this is when I passed out. 

  The next thing I remember is that I was standing in the hallway staring at my  body. I was surprised I wasn't in it. I could see my girlfriend calling me and trying to wake me up. I wanted to tell her and my friends that I am was here and that  I am fine, but they couldn't hear me. It was like I didn't exist. I could see my girlfriend bursting into tears, but I couldn't talk to her. It was really difficult watching her break like that. 

  I saw the paramedics come in.  It was  odd to see  a child come in with the paramedics but nobody tried to keep the child away. It was a baby boy, about 1 to 2 years old. He was very cute with dark blue eyes, pale skin and dark hair. The child was staring at me and acting like he could see me. I was tired and exhausted. I fell on the ground. I could see the paramedics giving me CPR for maybe two minutes as  they  tried to get me to breathe. It may have been longer or shorter in time, I don't know. I knew that I had to go back to my body, but I was exhausted and couldn't carry myself all the way to my body. The EMT put the defibrillators on my chest to  shock me back to life. The child was still staring at me. I was too tired to walk or even  stand. 

  I   asked the child for help, because I thought that he could see me. I remember him touching me. I hugged him. The hug felt familiar, like I knew him and like he was a part of me. He looked at me and smiled. His smile gave a just enough strength to go back to my body. I knew it was now or never and that  this was my only chance to go back to my body. By this time, I think the EMT was still preparing the defibrillators on my chest. The child was looking at my body, like he wanted me to go back into it. I wanted to go back, but at the same time I was hesitant. I saw the paramedics shock me; I could see the electricity going to my body. I can't remember what happened that made me get up and run to my body but just before I dove into my body, I looked back at the child. He was still smiling. Then I doved into my body. 

  The next thing I remember is the light that the EMT was shining into my  eyes as he was asking me if I know where I am. In the hospital, all types of test were done on me, but the doctors couldn't find what caused my NDE. They said that it may have been from the concussion, but they couldn't confirm it. Up to this date, the cause my NDE remains a mystery.

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It felt real, I could remember every detail from that day every time I walked in or out of the cafeteria. I looked for the child sometimes. but I couldn't find him.  
  
  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     I still have the same feelings towards it.  
  
At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No     

Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         Do not entirely focus on the spiritual and the religious aspect of the experience, ask more general questions.
