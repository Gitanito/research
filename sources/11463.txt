A spike in blood pressure caused a blood vessel to burst in my nose. I tried for several hours to get it to stop, but to no avail. I eventually had my wife take me to the local hospital, while waiting to get help; I started to go into shock. The triage nurse measured my blood pressure as (approximately) 170 over 120. When a doctor came to take me to an examination room, my legs gave out and was carried into the exam room. I remember nurses continually asking if I was still with them, and I thought, 'How absurd, of course I am still here.' I then found myself walking through a grassy field, the sun warm on my face, the trees off in the distance turning fall colors. The grass was about thigh high, but not difficult to walk through. I felt absolute happiness and peacefulness. I got the feeling that someone was just over the rise waiting for me. I then found myself back in that ugly green exam room with the doctors holding my legs up over my head and saying, 'He's back. We've got him.' I was so disappointed, almost angry to be back. I was only gone a few seconds.
