I then drank at least two or three energy drinks.  My friends dropped by.  I smoked some dope with them (just a joint, I had done this many times before).  We were sitting at the table and I fainted. The next thing I knew I was in another place.  It was a white room, and I was sitting on a box covered in white shag pile carpet.  The door to the left was shut. I could hear kids playing outside. I had no pain and felt happy and relaxed. I was talking to someone, but I could not tell you whom it was. I got the impression that they didn't expect me there, as the person I was talking to was coming through a door.  The door opened to me, and all I could see was bright light!  Then, here on Earth, I heard my brother start to talk to me. He put a cold cloth on my head, and I was back. Everyone that was at the table said I looked dead.  All the color had drained out of me. Not my brother, though. He said, 'She just fainted, that's all.'

The funny thing is, I always wondered about white shag pile carpet - how do you keep it clean? I remember studying it while I was there. I must have been dressed in white, because I feel like I blended in. I do remember watching my hand feel the carpet. Now I am no longer able to smoke dope û it knocks me out.  Why, I don't know. I've had a brain scan, everything looks good. I've given up drinking energy drinks as they make your heart go faster - too fast for me. They hooked me up to a heart machine, and my heart was going flat out. I think what happened was due to a combination of things.  For one thing, when the heart stops, you have three seconds until you pass out.  

In my current life, I'm in pain every day, but when I was there I wasn't.  I miss that place.  I wonder - what if I had gone through the door?
