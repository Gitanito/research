  This was an orthodox presentation of Bahai, with excerpts from the writings of Baha-Ullah, Abdul-Baha, and various missionaries of the movement to the West, and regular reports of the doings of the Assemblies throughout America and the world--including, notably, a report on the efforts of a Mr. John A. Wilcott, photographed while mounted on a horse with pistol, sombrero and the like, to spread Bahai among American cowboys.  It is included here because of the attraction that Bahai, with its universalistic beliefs and claimed associations with actual, historical oriental sages, had for the adherents of New Thought, Theosophy, and the like in the first quarter of the twentieth century.
