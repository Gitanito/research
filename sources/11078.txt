  		              		Experience Description   

    After 19 hours of non-stop work, I went to a bar with my friends to have a few drinks. They were playing Rock music. After an hour, we left the bar  and were going towards our car. It was winter and the weather can get very cold during winters in Canada. It was close to 3 am and I think it was like 15 degrees below zero. As we were walking toward the car, a strange feeling came over me. I was not feeling the cold anymore. Not only that, but I was feeling a pleasant breeze on my face.  The sky was so clear and stars looked very brilliant and close. 

  I had a strange feeling, like I just had been released from a very tight and pressing casting of my body. I never had felt so good before. Suddenly, I looked down and saw that I was floating in the air and saw myself from above lying down on the ground. My friends had circled around me and one of them was resting my head on his lap. He was shaking me to get up. I looked at them for a short while, but don’t know what happened. I was suddenly back in my body. 
  
  I opened my eyes and felt better. My friends told me that I had suddenly gone unconscious and collapsed to the ground. I had not told this story to anyone for years. I saw this website today and noticed that lots of people have experienced similar events and it was very interesting to me. Since the experience, I have lost the fear of death and will never forget that indescribable feeling at the moment of death.
