  		              		Experience Description   

    I was in the emergency room, when suddenly my Being burst through the ceiling and headed to the stars above. I was heading to a warm, gentle light.The path toward the light had Beings that I could see in my peripheral vision. Yet, I was focused on that light. The light was all-knowing and all-Loving as it melted into my Being. Once it had covered  and enlightened me, I knew I had to go back the way I came. I returned to the hospital at ceiling level and had no idea of location. I began searching for my earthly body. In that instant that I found my body, I was reunited with my earthly body. 

  That experience was 50 years ago and I still cherish the event. I spent 70 days in the hospital and finally went home. I learned how to walk again, had numerous surgeries, etc. I developed a friendship with one of the residents, who was a Buddhist. One night we talked about the experience, which was so profound. His reply to our discussion was, 'My son you have seen the silver thread of life.' From that point, I was able to file the experience in my brain. My brain had been in constant search for meaning of this experience. In the 5 decades since this life-changing event, never have I regretted or wished it never happened. It has allowed me to help so many people in so many different ways. I learned that in giving, we learn to receive.
