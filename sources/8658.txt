I moved to Florida   when I was 22 to help my parents through a divorce.&nbsp; I was having difficulty   finding a job and applied just about everywhere I went.&nbsp; I finally took a job   waitressing at a Bennigan's even though I had been offered the job there two   weeks prior. I rejected it then because the manager said they were not very busy   and he couldn't offer me a lot of hours.&nbsp; However, it was the only thing   available after endless searching and something kept telling me to go back.&nbsp; It   was as if I were being &quot;called there&quot; and perhaps that is why I could not find   another job.

On my orientation   day, the manager was showing me around. As we entered the kitchen, the grill   cook was standing with his back to me.&nbsp; When he turned around, he flashed me the   biggest smile I have ever seen.&nbsp; At that moment, something literally &quot;clicked&quot;   inside my head and I heard a voice say &quot;He's special.&quot;&nbsp; One night after work a   bunch of us went to a bowling alley to hang out.&nbsp; Matt (the cook) and I fell   into a conversation when we got there that lasted the entire evening.&nbsp; We didn't   talk to anyone else the whole night.&nbsp; Later, he told me he felt the same &quot;click&quot;   when we started talking that I felt when I first saw him.&nbsp; We have been married   for 15 years now and always joke about how we are &quot;soulmates&quot;.&nbsp; But really, we   are!&nbsp; I truly believe our getting together was &quot;helped&quot; by other-worldy   influences.&nbsp; It was truly love at first sight!

  ===================

Thanks for writing   back.&nbsp; I don't mind at all if you share it, I'd appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another   interesting piece of information is that Matt and I often share thoughts.&nbsp; One   of us will think something and the other will say it right at the very next   instant.&nbsp; I don't know how we do it, it's always done unconsciously, in fact we   always laugh and try to figure out how to do it on purpose but we haven't yet.&nbsp;   I wonder how many other soulmates do this as well?&nbsp;

BTW I read your   book on near death experiences.&nbsp; I was amazed how many people's experiences   coincided with things that I have read in Buddhist and Christian doctrine.&nbsp;   I was very comforted by the book.

You can put my   name down however, it is not a secret with us that we are soulmates. We are   quite thankful that we found each other!&nbsp;

Keep up the good   work and research -- it's very important!&nbsp;
