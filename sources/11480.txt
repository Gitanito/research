I'm still not sure what was real and what wasn't. I do remember at the hospital, seeing two doctors and one nurse standing at the bedside of a patient. I knew it to be me. I later found out from a friend. I saw everything as it was. The room I was in didn't have a ceiling, only walls and floor all brightly lit. Where my perception was centered, was beautiful. There was a full moon and every star shone more brightly than ever before. I was standing on the threshold, and all I had to do was step away. I felt voices rather than heard them. I said I wasn't ready, and woke in an intensive care unit 11 days later.
