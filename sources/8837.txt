  		              		Experience Description   

    When I was young I was brought up by my grandparents for several years. They were simple people, tending their garden and breeding a few animals. Until my adolescence, I suffered from repeated asthma attacks. The attacks were frequent and often difficult. My grandparents were heavy smokers and with the animals around, the surrounding atmosphere was not favorable for my many allergies. My grandmother was reluctant toward medication and preferred the old methods, like home remedies, rather than the doctor's prescriptions. 
  
  One night I became ill, with a bad asthma attack.  I had big difficulties and couldn't  breathe.  I was sent to bed without any special care and I remember that my condition got worse and  breathing became very labored. It sounded like I was hissing. Finally I fell asleep (I believe). Of what happened afterwards, I only kept two very precise memories.
  
  The first one. I had an impression of a very vast area. I saw a light like a sun, but it was more a sensation of appeasement, rather than a light. There was  no heat, only a sensation of well-being and calm. I was fine with no difficulty in breathing. I  had a feeling of floating. There were silhouettes, presences facing me, but I couldn't see faces. I only saw vague silhouettes, like shadows. Their presence was surrounding me. They were strangers but with no hostility towards me. There was a voice talking to me. It said something like, 'It's too early, it's not now. It's not your time.'

  I woke up drenched in sweat and the same for the bed sheets. I was completely healed. I had no  problems breathing.  I usually needed medications and inhalators to come out of my attacks.  But not this time. I got up and my second precise memory is that I felt a sensation that is very difficult to explain. It was like an absolute plenitude, a calm or serenity that I never felt again in all my life. It is really a sensation which is difficult to describe, it was like being very light, as if nothing negative could reach me, having no fear of the next day.

  I know that I was young and over time, I often asked myself if I wasn't dreaming, or being delirious because of fever or an agitated sleep. My grandparents were believers but not practicing. Nobody ever talked about the supernatural, of paradise, nor even about beliefs at home. We didn't watch fantastic movies. My grandparents  only watched TV for the news, variety shows and football. In short, nothing could have influenced me or suggesting things that would then appear in a dream. Therefore I'm convinced that I experienced something which is really not common. On the other hand, I have no memory of being out of body, nor traveling through a tunnel or anything like I read from other's NDEs.

  I never talked to anybody about this experience at all, except to my partner who has my full trust. She  believes me. I knew that many would have thought about distorted memories, or a wrongly interpreted dream.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

  Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning.     Difficult to express, but time didn't seem to count during the experience.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         No  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       Difficult to say, as it was long ago. I don't remember significant differences.

  Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         Some unfamiliar and strange place.     Again, I saw no precise landscape. No meadows, hills, gardens or other. It's more a sensation of vast areas, like a great, immense space of sky.

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience       

  Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Uncertain.     I have no religious belief as I don't recognize myself in any religion. Nevertheless I think that there is something else other than our earthly lives, but without any idea about what it is.  

  Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin.   I saw imprecise silhouettes. I don't remember any faces, but do remember  outlines of persons. No memories of auras or wings, nor anything like that. It is difficult to know if they were people or something else.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         No  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         No

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      No     

Did you believe that our earthly lives Are meaningful and significant prior to your experience?         Unknown  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         No       

Did you believe in an afterlife prior to your experience?         Unknown  

  Do you believe in an afterlife after your experience?         An afterlife probably exists.     Yes.     I didn't receive any precise information, but the fact that I was told (who?) that it is too early, that it's not the time, suggests that there is something waiting for me afterwards.  

Did you fear death prior to your experience?         Unknown  

Do you fear death after your experience?         I moderately fear death  

Were you fearful living your life prior to your experience?         Not fearful in living my earthly life  

Were you fearful living your life after your experience?         Moderately fearful in living my earthly life

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Unknown       

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          No   

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   Difficult to put words on the sensations and memories of sensations. Plenitude and serenity are what comes closest.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The memory of the feeling of plenitude, when I was waking up, stays profoundly anchored, while I experienced more dramatic events during this period and even later on, and they are not as precise.  

  Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain     I sometimes have the impression that an intuition gives me the right choice to do something, even though I'm not always following this information. Sometimes a 'feeling' is going through with some persons, or not.  

  Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    Almost 35 years before I was talking about. My partner listened to me and believed me. I'm not used to tell nonsense to make myself important. I don't know if what I told her has influenced her in any way.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

  What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     It was not possible for me to believe that I was dreaming, the sensation was too precise. And my healing that I can't explain.  

  What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was probably real.     I'm still convinced that I experienced what I'm describing. However, for the sake of credibility I can't deny that it is possible that I'm wrong, even if I'm about 99% sure.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No
