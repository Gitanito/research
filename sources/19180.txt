dr greyer made a statement
and called out the five talking heads on
the major media it was a major maneuver
and it kind of shook up the ufology
world
he called out lou elizondo among others
we reached out to them all to invite him
on a cordial debate let&#39;s discuss this
like grown men
we have received hostile responses to
the invitation
some were quite provocative
all right i&#39;m going to assume then that
you&#39;re not going to take up dr stephen
greer on his offer to have a online live
debate on third phase of moon then
who&#39;s career
there you go i&#39;m kidding
look uh
i i don&#39;t look i don&#39;t negotiate with
terrorists bottom line
yeah who&#39;s got some issues he called you
like he says he doesn&#39;t negotiate with
terrorists
yes well i mean you know
myself and people some people worked
with me have been called
terrorists every other thing traitors
because we&#39;re not willing to go along
with this
a corrupt game and we call it out dr
steven greer coming at you at different
angles and all the sublets that they
have around them coming at you i mean
how hard is that to to deflect all of
that pressure i don&#39;t know what to tell
you man but there&#39;s look
heaven&#39;s gate and jim jones comes to
mind insane the moral high ground that
he thinks he occupies in this situation
i think i think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s turning
people against each other
you you have these five guys and and
they
they have a narrative they&#39;re not moving
from it and it&#39;s not the truth he will
never uh debate
with anyone that has any knowledge and
uh for him to say that
that dr greer is uh
a terrorist or
is someone who is lacking in knowledge
or truth is ridiculous
it&#39;s preposterous
