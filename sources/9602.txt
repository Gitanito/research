  		              		Experience Description   

    I apologize for my English, I'm using google translator and I'm not sure my description is correct.

  I had a vision of a gray area with many scattered boards and beams.  At the top right is a circular light, which had an incredibly bright center that was inviting me to enter. Suddenly I realized with horror that it was the transition between life and death.  I said, 'I do not want to enter. I have not tried everything in my life.' The beams around, slowly lifted one after the other. There was like an invisible hand that began to nail them over the circular light until it was almost covered. There were small  gaps between the boards with a little light shining between the beams.
  
  After some time, maybe some minutes, the light began to reappear. But this time it appeared  down toward the left.  I did not let it light up and told him to go away. Then it disappeared.
