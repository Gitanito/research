  		              		Experience Description   

    In life I believed there was a GOD, but I never really paid attention to it or even cared about it. I was just a regular guy going through life, doing what’s necessary to survive in this world but in a good and legal way. I was the type of person that believed whatever is going to happen to me sooner or later It will happen to me and there’s no escaping it.  I’m a visual learner, so I’m the type who has to see to believe. I won’t just take somebody’s word for it. 

  When I was about 20 years old, I was at a deli ordering a sandwich. The guy who made my sandwich got the order wrong.  He forgot ketchup so I told the guy he didn’t add some. He told me he was sorry.  I told him that it is  all right, don't worry about it because nobody’s perfect. There was  a lady next to me who was listening to  the conversation. She looked at me and says, 'Only GOD is perfect.' I told her,  'Well, I haven't met GOD. Maybe when I meet him, I’ll know if he’s perfect.' She  gave me a smirk. I got my sandwich and left. 

  About a few months later, I had an NDE in midtown Manhattan Park. I was with three other friends who  I  knew through a program we were attending. I didn’t know any of them personally. We were sitting down on the grass. My heart was hurting and it became difficult for me to breathe. I didn't want to make a scene, so  I just laid back on the grass. I told myself that whatever wais going to happen, is going to happen. So I basically just went with the flow. 

  Then, I felt a very painful, strong force pulling me under the ground. It felt as if it was trying to drag me to hell. But It seemed  a million times stronger than gravity itself. I  started fighting this force by moving my body/soul left to right and trying to escape from its grip.  I noticed that the more I fought this force, the more the pain increased.  The pain was  unbearable. I asked  myself, 'How can anybody endure this type of pain without dying or exploding?' I fought this force with every inch of strength I had in me, but to no avail. 

  That’s when I realized that I was dead. I was experiencing pain in the spirit realm. The afterlife is SO REAL that it makes this world seem fake.  I figured that I had no other option but to just give up. I then relaxed and gave in to the force/pain. 

   I looked up to the clouds and noticed a beautiful bright light looking directly at me. The light was 10,000 times brighter than the sun, yet I could look straight at it. The light was literally made of LOVE. Everything I ever wanted was with the light and the light was Jesus Christ himself. I just knew it was him... John 8:12 (KJV) Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. As I looked at this perfect, beautiful, glorious, and loving bright light, I felt unworthy to look at the light. It was just too much for me. I then tried speaking to the light, but couldn’t speak verbally. So telepathically I thought, 'GOD, I have never done anything for you. I can’t go with you even if I wanted to so whoever is going to take me,  take me now. But please stop the pain!'  I was experiencing the  good and the bad at the same time. The light acknowledged my thoughts. My spirit then got out of my body and floated up to the height of a cloud. 
 
   I was looking down at my lifeless body from above. I could see and hear my friends calling my name trying to wake me up. I looked at the surroundings around my body and I could see everything in beautifully intense, bright-sparkly, and vivid colors. 
 
  Then,  I got a life flashback from the moment I was born, to the moment of my death. I realized everything we do in this earthly life is recorded. Suddenly, I fell back into my body in like a teardrop form. I landed back into my body as the EMT workers were picking me up in a gurney and putting me in the ambulance. They started driving me to the hospital. One of the emergency medical technicians was pinching my finger, trying to keep me awake. My body felt extremely heavy and then I blacked out. 
 
  I woke up in the hospital with the IV on my left arm. I was telling the doctors that I SAW GOD! I saw GOD! No one believed me and people thought I was crazy. I then grabbed my stuff and left the hospital. I was a bit disappointed because this is without a doubt the best and worst thing that has ever happened to me in my entire  life and no one believed me. I got home and told my mother a few days later. 

  A few weeks later, I was walking around Brooklyn.  I felt like I had to do something, but  didn’t know what it was. I kept walking and then saw a church across the street. I went in this big church and saw an old lady sitting in the right midsection of the church with  her head down and praying. In the front left corner was a guy minding his own business and cleaning the church. I than sat down on the last rows of the church waiting for them to leave.  I don’t think they even noticed me in the church. So, I stood up and walked all the way in front of the church. In front of the  big cross,  I got on my knees and repented to Jesus Christ. I said, 'God, I’m sorry. Please forgive me for everything I’ve done.' I was weeping like a baby  as I asked God for forgiveness. I felt a right hand literally touch me on my right shoulder blade as if it was comforting me. I got goosebumps all over my body.  I looked back to see who touched me and there was no one there. I got out of the church feeling like a whole new person that day. 

  God never spoke to me when I had my NDE, but I believe the purpose of life is LOVE because GOD is LOVE. In a way, I guess I just needed confirmation that God exists. God  gave that confirmation to me. This experience changed me completely. 

A few things I learned in my NDE:

  NUMBER 1- Jesus Christ is GOD John 14:6 (KJV) Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father but by me. John 8:12 (KJV) Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. The bright, beautiful, loving light that I saw during my NDE was Jesus Christ. 

  NUMBER 2 - Everything in life is Recorded. Luke 8:17 (KJV) For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. 

NUMBER 3 - there is an afterlife  

  NUMBER 4 - when I repented and asked God for forgiveness  1 John 1:9 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' When I left the church I felt different like I was a new creation. 2 Corinthians 5 (KJV) Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new. Also, I forgot to mention that when my spirit left my body, it felt natural to me.  I also had a download of information so there was nothing for me to ask the Light/GOD because I was all-knowing.  I realized  that there is absolutely no time in the spirit realm. I don’t know how I knew, but I just knew time didn’t exist. 

This experience changed me completely. I’m more of a humble person and I try to live my life with love.
  
    God bless everyone and thank you.

    Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I’m not judgmental. I try to understand and help as much as I can.    
    
    After the NDE:         

    Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It's difficult to explain in words because earthly words don't do the experience justice.    

    How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience more accurately than other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  The afterlife experience was so real that It makes this early life seem fake. I remember my NDE as if it happened yesterday.    

    Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         Uncertain.     After my experience, I had an experience with an orb that I could see in the corner of my eyes. But everytime I turned to look, it disappeared.  I also had one dream of a girl that actually came true. But besides those two experiences, I haven’t had anything else.    
    
    Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          Yes the light that I saw was the best thing that has ever happened to me.

    Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No       

    What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real.     The NDE experience was so real that it makes this earthly life seem fake. It’s hard to explain but that’s the best way I can explain it.    
    
    What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real.     Everything of my NDE experience was heightened to a level that I know for a fact it was real.    
    
    At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No       

    Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experience?         Please give Jesus Christ a chance. He can definitely change your life. John 14:6 (KJV) Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the father but by me.    
    
    Are there any other questions that we could ask to help you communicate your experience?         All the questions you  ask are accurate questions.
