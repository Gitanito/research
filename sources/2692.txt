A FTER the creation of man, the Creator,
J ehovih, said unto him : That thou
shalt know thou art the work of My hand, I
have given thee capacity for knowledge, power,
and dominion. This was the first era.
2. But man was helpless, he understood not
the voice of the Almighty, neith_
er stood he
upright. And J ehovih called His angels, who
were older than the earth, and He said unto
them : Go ye, raise man upright, and teach
him to understand.
3. And the angels of heaven descended to
the earth and raised man upright. And man
wandered about on the earth. This was the
second era.
4. J ehovih said to the angels that were with
man: Behold, man hath multiplied on the
earth. Bring ye them together ; teach them
to dwell in cities and nations.
5. And the angels of J ehovih taught the
peoples of the earth to dwell together in cities
and nations. This was the third era.
6. And in that same time the Beast (self)
rose up before man, and spake to him, saying:
Possess thou whatsoever thou wilt, for all
things are thine, and are good for thee.
7. And man obeyed the Beast; and war
came into the world. This was the fourth era.
8. And man was sick at heart, and he called
out to the Beast, saying : Thou saidst : Possess
thyself of all things, for they are good for thee.
Now, behold, war and death have encompassed
me about on all sides. I pray thee, therefore,
teach me peace !
9. But the Beast said: Think not I am come
to send peace on the earth ; I come not to send
peace, but a sword. I come to set man at vari-
ance against his father; and a daughter against
her mother. Whatsoever thou findest to eat,
be it fish or flesh, eat thou thereof, taking no
thought of to-morrow.
10. And man ate fish and flesh, becoming
carnivorous, and darkness came upon him,
neither yet heard he the voice of J ehovih, nor
believed in Him. This was the fifth era.
11. And the Beast divided itself into four
great heads, and possessed the earth about i ·
and man fell down and worshipped them.
12. And the names of the heads of the Beast
were, BRAHMIN, BUDDHIST, CHRISTIAN, and
MOHAMMEDAN. And they divided the earth,
and apportioned it between themselves, choos-
ing soldiers and standing armies for the main-
tenance of their earthly aggrandizement.
13. And the Brahmins had seven million
soldiers ; the Buddhists twenty million ; the
Christians seven million; and the Mohamme-
dans two million, whose trade was killing man.
And man, in service of the Beast, gave one-
sixth of his life and his labor to war and stand-
ing armies ; and one-third of his life he gave
to·dissipation and drunkenness. This was the
sixth era.
14. J ehovih called to man to desist from
evil ; but man heard Him not. For the cun-
ning of the Beast had changed man's flesh, so
that his soul was hid as if in a cloud, and he
loved sin.
15. J ehovih called unto His angels in heaven,
saying: Go ye down to the earth once more,
to man, whom I created to inhabit the earth
and enjoy it, and say ye to man: Thus saith
Jehovih:
16. Behold, the seventh era is at hand. Thy
Creator commandeth thy change from a car-
nivorous man of contention, to an herbivorous
man of peace. The four heads of the Beast
shall be put away; and war shall be no more
on the earth.
17. Thy armies shall be disbanded. And, .
from this time forth, whosoever desireth not
to war, thou shalt not impress; for it is the
commandment of thy Creator.
18. Neither shalt thou have any God, nor
Lord, nor Savior, but only thy Creator, Jeho-
vih ! Him only shalt thou worship hence-
forth forever. I am sufficient unto Mine own
creations.

11. To my captains and generals who showed
great skill in killing, I built monuments in
stone and iron. Yea, I inscribed them from
top to bottom with their bloody victories.
12. And in my vanity I called out to the
young, saying: Behold the glory of great men !
These great monuments I have builded to
them!
13. And the youth of my household were
whetted with ambition for spoil. The example
of my hand made them train themselves for
warfare.
14. To my colonels and generals I gave
badges of gold. I called to the damsels, say-
ing: Come, a great honor I give to you; ye
shall dance with the officers of death !
15. And they tripped up on tip-toe, elated
by the honey of my words ! 0 J ehovih, how
have I not covered up my wickedness; how
have I failed to make the flow of my brother's
blood the relish of satan !
16. To my destroying hosts I have given
great honor and glory. In the pretence of
enforcing peace I hewed my way in flesh and
blood.
17. I made great pretensions in a kingdom.
I called out to my people, saying: We must
have a kingdom. • I showed them no reason for
it ; but I bade them take up arms and follow
me for patriotism's sake. And yet what was
patriotism? Behold, I made it as a something
greater than Thee and Thy commandment :
'rHoU SHALT NOT KILL.
18. Yea, by the cunning of my words, I
taught them my brother was my enemy; that
to fall upon him and his people and destroy
them was great patriotism.
19. And they ran at the sound of my voice,
for my glory in the greatness of my kingdom,
and they committed great havoc.
20. Yea, I built colleges for training my
young men .in warfare. I drew a boundary
hither and thither, saying : This is my king-
dom ! All others are my enemies ! ·
21. I flattered the young men with the work
of death; I said: Ye men of war! Great shall
be your glory !
22. And their judgment was turned away
from peace; I made them think that righteous-
ness was to stand up for me and my country,
and to destroy my brother and his people.
23. 'rhey built me forts and castles and arse-
nals without number. I called unto my peo-
ple, saying : Come, behold the glory of my
and ships of war, and torpedoes, shouting:
Hurrah for our kingdom! We have faith in
these things, more than in Thee, our Creator!
25. 'rhus I led them away from Thee.
Their eyes I turned down in the way of death.
By the might of my armies, I put away
righteousness.
26. I covered the earth over with drunk-
ards, and widows and orphans; to beggary I
reduced them, but 1 whetted their pride by
saying : Behold what great standing armies we
have !
27. To the man that said : 'rhere shall come
a time of peace, when war shall be no more
forever, I mocked and said : Thou fool .
28. l know the counts against me, 0 Father.
I cannot hide my iniquity from Thy sight. I
have said war was a necessary evil to prevent
a too populous world ! I turned my back
toward the wide, unsettled regions of the
earth. With this falsehood in my mouth I
stood. up before Thee ! Yea, I cried out as if
for the righteous, saying : I war for righteons-
ness, and for the protection of the weak ! In
the destrnction of my brethren I stood as a
murderer, pleadiBg this excuse. Stubbornly
I persisted in not seeing justice on the other
side, whilst I cut down whom Thou l1adst
created alive. Above the works of Thy hand
I raised myself up as a pruning knife in Thy
vineyard. .
29. Yea, more than this, I persuaded my
sons and daughters that to war for me was to
war for our Father in heaven. By such blas-
phemy led I them into ruin~ And when the
battle was over for a day I cried out : Behold
the glory of them that were slain for the honor
of their country ! Thus have I added crime
to crime before Thee, J ehovih; thus destroyed
Thy beautiful creation. Verily, have I not one
word in justification of my deeds before Thee !
30. 0 that 1 had remained faithful with
Thee, J ehovih ! But I invented gods unto the
glory of the evil one.· In one place I called
out to my sons and daughters, saying: Be ye
BrahRlins; Brahma saveth whosoever profess-
eth his name. In another place I said: Be ye
Buddhists; Buddha saveth whosoever calleth
on his name. In another place I said : Be ye
Christians ; Christ saveth whosoever calleth
on his name. In another place I said : Be ye
Mohammedans; whosoever saith: There is
but one God and Mohammed is his prophet !

CHAPTER I.
A LL was. ALL is. ALL ever shall be. The
ALL spake, and Motion was, and is, and
ever shall be; and, being positive, was called
He and Him. The ALL MOTION was His speech.
2. He said, I AM ! And He comprehended
all things, the seen and the unseen. Nor is
there aught in all the universe but what is
part of Him.
3. He said, I am the soul of all ; and the all
that is seen is of My person and My body.
4. By virtue of My presence all things are.
By virtue of My presence is life. By virtue of My
presence are the living brought forth into life.
I am the QurcKENER, the MovER, the CREATOR,
the DESTROYER. I am FIRST and LAST.
5. Of two apparent entities am I, never-
theless I AM BUT ONE. These entities are the
UNSEEN, which is POTENT, and the SEEN, which
is of itself IMPOTENT, and called CoRPOR.
6
6. With these two entities, in likeness there-
by of Myself, made I all the living; for as the
life is the potent part, so is the corporeal part
the impotent part.
7. Chief over all that live on the earth I
made Man; male and female made I them.
And that man might distinguish Me, I com-
manded him to give Me a name; by virtue of
My presence commanded I him. And man
named Me not after anything in heaven or on
the earth. In obedience to My will named he
Me after the sounds the wind uttereth, and he
said, E-0-Ih ! Which is now pronounced
J ehovih, and is written thus:
BOOK OF JEHOVIH. 2
CHAPTER II.
JEHOVIH said : By virtue of my presence
created I the seen and the unseen worlds.
And I commanded man to name them ; and
man named the seen worlds Corpor, and the
unseen worlds Es ; and the inhabitants of Cor-
por, man named corporeans. But the inhabi-
tants of Es he called sometimes es'eans and
sometimes spirits and sometimes angels.
2. J ehovih said: I created the earth, and
fashioned it, and placed it in the firmament;
and by My presence brought man forth a living
being. A corporeal body gave I him that he
might learn corporeal things ; and death I
made that he might rise in the firmament and
inherit My etherean worlds.
3. 'l'o es I gave dominion over corpor; with
es I filled all place in the firmament. But
corpor I made into earths and moons and stars
and suns; beyond number made I them, and I
caused them to fl.oat in the places I allotted to
them.
4. Es I divided into two parts, and I com-
manded man to name them, and he named one
etherea and the other atmospherea. These
are the three kinds of worlds I created ; but
I gave different densities to atmospherean
worlds, and different densities to the etherean
worlds.
5. For the substance of My etherean worlds
I created Ethe, the MosT RAREFIED. Out of
ethe made I them. And I made ethe the most
subtle of all created things, and gave to it
power and place, not only by itself, but also
power to penetrate and exist within all things,
even in the midst of the corporeal worlds.
And to ethe gave I dominion over both atmos-
pherea and corpor.
6. In the ALL HIGHEST places created I the
etherean worlds, and I fashioned them of all
shapes and sizes, similar to My corporeal
worlds. But I made the etherean worlds
inhabitable both within and without, with
entrances and exits, in arches • and curves,
thousands of miles high and wide, and over-
ruled I them with PERFECT mechanism ; and
in colors and movable chasms and mountains in
endless change and brilliancy. To them I gave
motions, and orbits and courses of their own;
indep.endent made I them, and above all other
worlds in potency and majesty.
7. Neither created I one etherean world like
another in size or density or in component
parts, but every one differing from another,
and with a glory matchless each in its way.
7
8. Atmospherean worlds I also created in
the firmament, and I gave them places and
orbits and courses for themselves. But atmos-
pherean worlds I created shapeless and void
of fixed form, for they are in process of con-
densation or dissolution, being intermediate in
condition betwixt My etherean and My cor-
poreal worlds. Of three degrees of density
created I them, and I commanded man to
name them, and one he called A'ji, and one
Ji'ay and one Nebulre.
9. But all of them are composed of the same
substances, being like the earth, but rarefied.
Nor is there on the earth or in it one thing,
even iron, or lead, or gold, or water, or oil, or
stones, but the same things are in My atrnos-
pherean worlds. As I have given light to the
earth so have I given light to many of them;
and all such have I commanded man to call
comets. And even so named he them.
10. And I also created atmospherea around
about My corporeal worlds; together made I
them.
CHAPTER III.
THUS spake J ehovih ; by the light of kos-
mon proclaimed He these things amongst
the nations of the earth.
2. Man looked upward in prayer, desiring
to know the manner of all created things, both
on earth and in heaven. And J ehovih an-
swered him, saying: .
3. The whirlwind made I as a sign to man
of the manner of My created worlds. As thou
beholdest the power of the whirlwind gathering
up the dust of the earth and driving it together,
know that even so do I bring together the a'ji
and ji'ay and nebulre in the firmament of ·
heaven; by the power of the whirlwind create
I the corporeal suns and moons and stars.
And I commanded man to name the whirlwinds
in the etherean firmament, and he named
them vortices and wark ; according to their
shape named he them.
4. By the power of rotation, swift driving
forth in the extreme parts, condense I the at-
mospherean worlds that fl.oat in the firma-
ment ; and these become My ·corporeal worlds.
In the midst of the vortices made I them, and
by the power of the vortices I turn them on
their axes, and carry them in the orbits I
allotted to them. Wider than to the moons of
a planet have I created the vortices, and they
carry the moons also.
5. Around about some of My corporeal
3 OAHSPE.
worlds have I given nebulous belts and rings,
that man might comprehend the rotation of
My vortexan worlds.
.6. For each and every corporeal world
created I a vortex first, and by its rotation
and by the places in the firmament whither it
traveleth, caused I the vortex to conceive the
corporeal world.
7. A great vortex created I for the sun,
and, within this vortex and subject to it, made
I the vortices of many of the corporeal worlds.
1'he sun vortex I caused to rotate, and I gave
it power to carry other vortices within it.
According to their density and position are
they thus carried forth and around about the
sun.
8. Think not, 0 man, that I created the sky
a barren waste, and void of use. Even as
man in the corporeal form is adapted to the
corporeal earth, so is he in the spiritual form
adapted to My etherean worlds. Three great
estates have I bestowed on man: the corpo-
real, the atmospherean and the etherean.
CHAPTER IV.
as nothing · in the firmament of heaven in
course of time.
6. Things that man seeth, created I with a
beginning and an encl; but the unseen I made
of endless duration.
7. The corporeal man made I belonging to
the seen; but the spiritual man made 1 as one
within the unseen, and everlasting. .
8. As the corporeal man beholdeth corpo-
real things, so doth the spiritual man follow
upward the evaporated, corporeal entities of
things. As corporeal things are tangible to
corporeans, so are es things tangible to the
spirits of the dead. ·
9. As I cause water to rise upward as vapor,
and take a place in the air above, let it be a
sign and testimony of other places in atmos-
pherea whereon dwell the spirits of the lower
heaven.
10. As I made a limit to the ascent of the
clouds, so made I a. limit to the places of the
different kinds of substances in atmospherea;
the more subtle and potent to the extreme, and
the more dense and impotent nearer to the
earth.
11. According to the condition of these dif-
ferent · plateaux in atmospherea, whether they

that is exhausted, and man shall weigh the

;f"AN perceived the magnitude and glory
..lV_l_ of the corporeal worlds. He said, How
shall I speak of Thy great works, 0 J ehovih,
and ·of Thy wisdom and power ! Shall I open
my mouth before Thee! I look upon Thy
countless stars, suns and moons, spread out
over the heavens ! The millions of years Thou
hast driven them on in the never-ending firma-
ment ! Processions in and out, and round
about, of mighty worlds ! By Thy breath going
forth!
2. 0 Thou, All Highest! How shall I hide
my insignificance! I cannot create the small~

3. Tell me, 0 my Creator, whence came life?
This unseen within me that is conscious of
being ? Tell me how all the living came into
life.
4. J ehovih heard the words of man, and He
answered him, saying: Let a sign be given to
man that he may comprehend se'mu. II 'rhere-
upon Jehovih caused the jelly-fish. and the
green scum of water to be permanently coming
forth in all ages, that man might understand
the age of se'mu, when the earth and the
shores by the water, and the waters also, were
covered over with commingled atmosphere and
corporeal substance. And this substance was
called se'mu, because by J ehovih's presence
quickened He it into life, and thus made He
all the living, both the vegetable and animal
worlds. Not that se'mu is jelly-fish or the
green scum of water ; for the earth in this day
produceth not se'mu abundantly; nevertheless
the jelly-fish and the green scum of water are
signs of that which was in that day of the
earth.II
· 5. J ehovih said: Because of My presence
quickened I into life all that live, or ever have
lived.
6. Because. I am male and female, even in
My likeness, thus made I them. Because I
am the power to quicken into life, so, in like-
ness of Me thus, made I them, and with power
to bring forth.

10. Let a sign be upon the earth, that man
in his darkness may not believe that one ani-

11. II Thereupon J ehovih gave permission
for different animals to bring forth a new liv-
ing animal, which should be unlike either its
mother or father, but he caused the new
product to be barren. II
12. J ehovih said: Auel this shall be testi-
mony before all men that I created each and
all the living, after their own kind only.
13. Such is My person and My spirit, being
from everlasting to · everlasting ; and when I
bring a new world into the time of se'mu, lo

carried forth, not by random, but purposely, in
the regions suited to it. Hence there is a time
for se'mu, a time for falling nebulre, to bury
deep the forests and se'muan beds, to provide
coal and manure for a time thereafter. So is
there a time when the earth passeth a region
in the firmament when sand and oil are rained
upon it and covered up, and gases bound and
sealed up for the coming generations of men.

16. And now was the earth in the latter
days of se'mu, and the angels could readily
take on corporeal bodies for themselves; out
of the elements of the earth clothed they
themselves, by force of their wills, with flesh
and bones. By the side of the Asuans took
they on corporeal forms.
17. And I said : Go ye forth and partake of
all that is on the earth; but partake ye not of
the tree of life, lest in that labor ye become
procreators and as if dead to the heavens
whence ye came.
18. II But those who had never learned cor-
poreal things, being imperfect in wisdom, com-
prehended not J ehovih's words, and they dwelt
with the Asuans, and were tempted, and par-
took of the fruit of the tree of life ; and lo
and behold they saw their own nakedness.
And there was born of the first race (Asu) a
new race called man; and J ehovih took the
earth out of the travail of se'mu, and the angels
gave up their corporeal bodies.II
19. Jehovih said: Because ye have raised up
those that° shall be joint heirs in heaven, ye
shall tread the earth with your feet, and walk
by the sides of the new born, being guardian
angels over them, for they are of your own
flesh and kin.
20. Fruit of your seed have I quickened
with My spirit, and man shall come forth with
a birth-right to My etherean worlds.
21. As I have quickened the seed of the
first born, so will I quicken all seed to the end
of the earth. And each and every man-child
and woman-child born into life will I quicken
with a new spirit, which shall proceed out of
Me at the time of conception. Neither will I
give to any spirit of the higher or lower heaven
power to enter a womb, or a fetus of a womb,
and be born again. ·
22. As the corporeal earth passeth away, so
shall pass away the first race Asu; but as I
pass not away, so shall not pass away the
suirit of man.
CHAPTER VII.
JEHOVIH said: Let a sign be given to the
inhabitants of the earth that they may
comprehend dan'ha in the firmament of heaven.
For even as I bequeathed to the earth a time
for creating the living, and a time for angels
to come and partake of the first fruits of mor-
t<Llity and immortality, so shall man at certain
times and seasons receive testimony from My
hosts in heaven.
11
2. II And J ehovih caused the earth, and the
family of the sun to travel in an orbit, the cir-
cuit of which requireth of them four million
seven hundred thousand years. And he placed
in the line of the orbit, at distances of three
thousand years, etherean lights, the which
places, as the earth passeth through, angels
from the second heaven come into its corporeal
presence. As embassadors they come, in com-
panies of hundreds and thousands and tens of
thousands, and these are called the ethereau
hosts of the Most High.
3. Not as single individuals come they; not
for a single individual mortal come they.
4. And J ehovih gave this sign to man on
earth; which is to say; In the beginning of
the light of dan'ha, the spirits of the newly
dead shall have power to take upon themselves
the semblance of corporeal bodies, and appear
and talk face to face with mortals. Every
three thousand years gave J ehovih this sign
on earth, that those who learned tlie powers
and capacities of such familiar spirits, might
bear testimony in regard to the origin of man
on earth.II
Jehovih said : And when it shall come to
pass in any of the times of dan'ha that these
signs are manifest, man shall know that the
hosts of the Most High come soon after. Let
him who will become wise, enumerate the great
lights of My serpent, for in such times I set
aside things that are old, and establish My
chosen anew.
5. II In the time of the earth, when man was
brought forth from mortal to immortal life,
the earth passed beyond se'mu and the angels
of heaven remained with corporeal man, but
not in the semblance of mortals, but as spirits;
and by virtue of their presence, strove to make
man wise and upright before J ehovih. Upon
the earth the number of such angels was
millions. To these angels spake J ehovih,
saying:
6. Behold the work ye have taken in hand!
It was commanded to you all, to partake of
all the fruits of the earth save of the fruit of
the tree of life, which is of the knowledge
of the earth and heaven, lest ye lose yor..r
inheritance in etherea.
7. Behold, ye now have sons and daughters
on the earth ; by your love to them are ye
become bound spirits of the lower heaven.
Until ye redeem them in wisdom and power
even to the sixth generation ye shall not again
arise and inherit My emancipated heavens.
8. To which end ye shall be co-workers with
1 OAHSPE.
one another in system and order. In My
name shall ye become an organic body and
known as the heaven of the earth, or lower
heaven, which shall travel with the earth.
9. And I will allot unto you a Chief, who is
wise in experience in founding heavenly king-
doms; and he shall appoint, from amongst you,
officers, and messengers, and ashars, and asaphs,
and es'enaurs, and ye shall be numbered and
apportioned unto your labor and places like
unto My other lower heavens on other worlds.
10. And he who is Chief shall be called God
of this heaven and the earth, unto his makin.g
bestow I them.
11. And God shall have a Council and throne
within his heavenly city; and the place shall
be called Hored, because it is the first kingdom
of God in this firmament.
12. And Goel shall rule on his throne, for it
is his ; and his Council shall rule with him ; in
My name shall they have dominion over angels
and mortals belonging to the earth.
13. And God shall appoint Chi.efs under him
who shall go down and dwell on the earth
with mortals ; and such Chiefs' labor shall
be with mortals for their resurrection. And
these Chiefs shall be called Lords, for they
are Gods of land, which is the lowest rank of
My commissioned Gods.
14. And God and his Lords shall have do-
minion from two hundred years to a thousand
or more years ; but never more than three
thousand years. According to the regions of
dan (light) into which I bring the earth, so
shall be the terms of the office of My Gods
and My Lords.
15. And God and his Lords shall raise up
officers to be their successors ; by him and
them shall they be appointed and crowned in
My name. ,
16. At the termination of the dominion of
My God and his Lords they shall gather to-
gether in these My bound heavens, all such
angels as have been prepared in wisdom and
strength for resurrection to My etherean king-
doms. AnQ. these angels shall be called Brides
and Bridegrooms to J ehovih, for they are
Mine and in My service.
17. And to God and his Lords, with the
Brides and Bridegrooms, will I send down
from etherea ships in the time of clan; by My
etherean Gods and Goddesses shall the ships
descend to these heavens, and receive God and
his Lords with the Brides and Bridegrooms,
and carry them up to the exalted regions I
have prepared for them.
12
18. And all such as ascend shall be called
a Harvest unto Me through My God and
Lords. And the time of My ;Harvests shall
be according to each dan, which is two hundred
years, four hundred years, six hundred years,
and five hundred years; and these shall be
called My lesser cycles, because they are the
times of the tables of prophecy which I give
unto My servants.
19. But at no other times, nor in any other
way, shall My Harvests ascend ·to My emanci-
pated worlds in etherea. Seven dans have I
created for each and every dan'ha; and six gen-
erations of mortals have I given unto each dan.
20. II The angels understood the command-
ments of J ehovih according to their knowledge
in the etherean heavens ; being heirs of other
planets, and having died in infancy, and having
matured in the es worlds ; but they under-
stood not the Creator according to the practice
of the lower heavenly kingdoms. Wherefore
their knowledge was incomplete.II
21. J ehovih said : I condemn ye not because
ye have become joint procreators' with the
asuans ; for ye have done two services unto ·
Me; which are to teach yourselves corporeal
things, that ye may understand and sympathize
with corporeans, and, secondly, because ye have
caused the earth to become peopled with such
as are capable of immortality.
22. Behold ye now what shall happen on
the earth : such as are of your flesh and kin
who cohabit together shall rise in wisdom and
virtue; but such of them as cohabit with the
asuans will bring forth heirs in the descending
grade of life. The first shall bring forth heirs
unto everlasting life; but the second shall
bring forth heirs that shall go out in darkness.
23. In the dominion of which ·matters your
God and Lords will instruct you, that ye may,
by inspiration and otherwise, learn to control
the behavior of mortals unto everlasting life.
And that these labors be not too severe upon
you, I created the dans and dan'has in the
firmament, wherein ye may be relieved from
the watch by other angels from other worlds
coming to exchange with you.
24. This also do I put upon you : That to
rule over mortals to virtue, by your own wills
governing them in all things, is contrary to My
commandments. For what honor hath any
man if m:;ide to do a thing?
25. But ye shall give mortals of My light,
leaving them to choose. Better it is for them
to suffer some than to grow up in ignorance of
the stings of disobedience.
BOOK OF JEHOVIH. 8
26. Behold, I make this a willing service on
your part: because ye have bound your a:lifec-
tions on the earth, to your own kin, ye willingly
become guardian angels over mortals. Yet I
made not a separate law unto you; as it is
with you, so shall it be with the spirits of
these mortals when they are born into the es
world : They will also desire to become guar-
and emperors. As My Gods and My Lords are
called My Sons, so shall kings and emperors
be called sons of God; through him shall they

9. This also have I created possible unto
My creations; for both angels and mortals
shall learn to know the elements of the heav-
ens and the earth, and to know the trials of
love and misfortune.
10. Nor have I made wisdom possible unto

14. And when the inhabitat10n of the earth
shall be completed, and the nations shall have
established civil communion around from east

earth into the kosmon era, and My angel ambas-

the recqrds of these heavenly kingdoms.
15. Through them will I reveal unto mortals
the creation of My worlds, and the history and
dominion of My Gods and Lords on the earth,

And the place was called Hored, because it was
the place of the first organic abiding place for

17. And Hored was situated over and above
the mountains of Aotan in Ughoqui, to the
eastward of Ul, of that country hereinafter

THE BOOK OF JUDGMENT.
. BEING THE GRADES AND RATES OF MORTALS AND ANGELS IN THE LIGHT OF
GOD, AS THE WORD CAME TO ES, DAUGHTER OF JEHOVIH.
CHAPTER I.
THESE are the words of Judgment· by the
will of God, J ehovih's Son, as rendered
by Es, for the resurrection of man :
2. Hear the words of thy God, 0 man ! I
am thy elder brother of tens of thousands of
years' experience. Profit thou in my wisdom,
and learn the discourse of thy God.
3. J ehovih, Creator of all things, spake to
me, thy God, saying : Give ear unto Me, 0
God, My embassador of the earth and her
heavens for this thy season. Obey My man-
dates, and teach mortals and the angels of thy
lower heavens to know Me and to rejoice in
My creations. The time is now come when
the light of thy inspiration and thy angels
shall extend around the whole earth and in her
heavens also.
4. In all former cycles, My Gods had to deal
with separate divisions of the earth; My reve-
lations were unto each, for a special time,
which is now at hand. I have prepared this
land untrammeled with Gods and Saviors and
Lords, enforced by the sword, so that My
revelations of this day shall be published and not
suppressed. And thou shalt reveal to mortals
the plan of My worlds ; and, as to who thou art,
and the method of thy inspiration and domin-
ion on the earth and her heavenly kingdoms.
5. Thou shalt keep open the gates of heaven
for a season, and the spirits of the dead shall
commune with mortals, good and evil, wise
and foolish. And mortals shall see them, and
talk with them, face to face ; and they shall
recognize their own kin, sons and daughters,
fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, the
dead and the living.
6. And the angels shall demonstrate the
subtlety of corporeal things, and the capacity
of one solid to pass through another solid
uninjured.
7. Yea, the angels shall bring from great
distances heavy substances, and cast them
down in the presence of mortals, who shall see
these things done, and testify thereto.
8. And man shall understand, that, even as
plants and trees and fish and serpents can be
wielded by My angels, so also can virus and
pestilence be carried by angels of darkness to
cast mortals in death.
9. And thou shalt suffer evil spirits and all
manner of drujas, and vampires and engrafters,
to come, and manifest unto mortals, that they
may know whereof My revelations unfold the
matters of earth and heaven.
10. For man shall understand what I mean
by the words : As ye live on the earth, so shall
ye reap in heaven.
11. And thou shalt suffer to fall in darkness
such mortals, as consult the angels in regard
to riches, or to marriage, or to self, or for
curiosity, or frivolity, or for anything of an
earthly nature for profit's sake. They shall
prosper for a season, but end in being con-
fronted with folly and falsehood.
12. And whoso asketh for the spirits of
great men, suffer ye him to be deceived by
drujas and all manner of lying spirits.
13. And whoso asketh of the sar'gis for
great men, or for Moses, or Jesus, or Kriste,
or for any well-known name, · as applied to
ancient times, suffer him to be answered by
evil spirits and deceivers.
14. Whoso desireth the angels for profit's
sake, and he have power in sar'gis, give unto
him a band of drujas and vampires, and give
them great power in signs and miracles.
15. And whoso consulteth the angels, with-
out regard to becoming a better man himself,
suffer him also to become captive to lying
spirits.
16. And to all men, that feed on fish or
flesh, suffer thou vampires to inhabit them.
753
2 OAHSPE.
17. And to such as drink to drunkenness,
and smoke or take narcotics, suffer thou fetals
and engrafters to come upon them.
18. And in families, whose heirs are born
from parents, wed for earthly considerations,
suffer thou spirits of obsession to enter and
drive them mad.
19. For they shall be made to know the
meaning of the word, hell, as applied to the
lower heavens.
20. And to whomsoever worshippeth Gods
or Saviors because of miracles, give thou them
plentifully of miracles and signs through un-
clean spirits, and through .mortal sar'gis
(mediums), of low grade. Yea, thou shalt
let spirits of darkness assume to be these very
Gods, that mortals may be made to know what
manner of evil spirits dw·en in their churches
and temples.
21. And to the rich man, who maketh pre-
tence to righteousness, but who doeth pot
toward the poor as to himself, give thou him
a host of spirits of hypocrisy and lying, that
he may realize the ·company he is preparing
his own spirit for in heave·n.
22. Give thou signs and miracles to the
unclean seer as well as to the clean ; to the liar
and deceiver, as well as to the trutll.ful man.
23. For I will destroy the worship of all
Gods and Lords and Saviors on the ground of
miracles.
24. And thou shalt take great liars, and
give them lying spirits to speak through them
by inspiration and entrancement. And these
spirits shall profess the names of great persons
long since dead. And they shall manifest
great oratory and wisdom and truth; but,
nevertheless, their preaching shall be of little
avail for righteousness' sake, or for good works.
25. And their applauding audiences will not
contribute to the poor, nor found any improve-
ment on the doctrines of the ancients.
26. For the spirits, who speak through them,
shall be the first resurrection, and know not
Me nor the higher kingdoms. Verily shall
they be of the same order as the spirits who
minister in the churches and temples, being
such spirits as have not yet been delivered up
from the earth.
27. And some shall say : H ear thou me, for
I am God ! Some shall say : Hear thou me,
for I am the Lord ! Some shall say : H ear
thou me, for I am J ehovih ! And others shall
profess the names of mortals who had great
power on the earth. Suffer thou them to do
these things.
28. For I will make man understand that he
shall accept nothing from angels or men because
of the name professed. On the merit only of
wisdom and truth, and such good doctrines as
raise men up out of darkness and poverty and
crime, shall they accept either spoken or writ-
ten words.
29. And they shall try to organize to carry
out good works, but they shall fail. For many
will desire to be leaders, being under the influ-
ence of selfish considerations, desiring the
applause of men.
30. And they will profess freedom, but they
will not pledge themselves to any sacrifice,
either of money or opinion for sake of the pub-
lic good.
31. And little good shall come out of their
works, and even less peace of soul shall come
unto them. For they shall dispute and quarrel,
being divided in all their ideas and philoso-
phies and sentiments and in their understand-
ing of My kingdoms.
32. For, by this means, shalt thou show
them they are under the inspiration of the un-
organized es world; and of spirits who have
not yet entered into My resurrections, which I
created for them. But in the time of the light
of My revelations, thou shalt raise up a few,
here and there, capable of the All Light. And
these, thou shalt cause to form a basis for My
kingdom on earth.
33. And they shall forswear all Gods and
Lords and Saviors, but profess Me, the Great
Spirit, Jehovih.
34. And they shall pledge themselves unto
one another in fullness, as brothers and sisters,
holding their possessions in common.
35. To live for sake of perfecting themselves
and others in spirit, and for good works.
36. They shall eat not fish nor flesh of any
creature that breathed the breath of life.
37. And keep the seventh day as a day of
communion with Me and My angel hosts.
38. vYith rites and ceremonies explanatory
of all the doctrines in the world.
39. Practicing good for evil; non-resistance
to persecution and abuse.
40. And abjure war; even, if . necessary,
by submitting to death rather than take part
therein.
41. And they shall become an organic body
in communities of tens and twenties and hun-
dreds and thousands.
42. But they shall have no leaders, only
their Creator ; but be organic, for sake of good
works.
754
THE BOOK OF JUDGMENT.
43. But they shall not go about preaching for
sinners to go to repentance.
44. Nor preaching for charity to the poor.
45. But they shall go themselves about gath-
ering ·up sinners, and the poor and helpless
and orphans ; and bring them into comfortable
homes, teaching them how to live, to be a glory
unto Me and My kingdoms.
46. To such persons shall My angels from
the second resurrection come, and minister in
My name for the joy of the earth.
47. And when such people die, they shall
be received into the second resurrection, escap-
ing the first.
48. Neither shall any other people in all the
world escape the place of the first resunec-
tion.
49. Be they kings, or queens, or beggars, or
Brahmans, or Budhists, or Kriste'yans, or Mo-
hammedans, or any other pretenders in heaven
or earth.
50. Behold, the day of preaching and pro-
fessions is at an end. I will have practice
only.
51. \Vhoso is not in My organic kingdoms on
earth, shall go into My inorganic kingdoms in
heaven.
52. Like unto like, created I the heavens and
the earth, and all things therein.
CHAPTER II.
GOD, embassador of Jehovih, saith: Ye
shall assemble for the communion of an-
gels, regularly, and maintain intercourse with
them. For in no other way can ye demonstrate
the continued life of the Spirit.
2. Doing this in the name of J ehovih, and
for spiritual light in regard to spiritual things.
3. Whoso consulteth the spirits for earthly
things shall fall in darkness.
4. But when ye assemble, let no man nor
spirit_
be as a spectator to others. But as all
men labor in the field to gather the harvest, so
shall all members in the assembly, by prayer
or by music, contribute a glory unto the Father.
5. Remembering that the humblest prayer,
even with weak words, if given with a full
heart, is as strong unto J ehovih as the best
oratory. .
6. From all men the spirit shall pour forth
unto the Father in praise, according to what
hath been created unto it. Neither is more
ing to speak by entrancement or by inspiration,
they shall imagine themselves controlled by
certain angels, when, in fact, it is only their
own spirit, eliminated from the corporeal
senses.
8. Others, being influenced, shall imagine it
is themselves and not an angel, whereas it is
an angel speaking through them. This was
the case of Ka'yu [Confucius - En.]. Both
are good, and shall be practiced.
9. Let no man concern himself as to whether
it be the spirit of himself or an angel ; for it is
only the subject uttered which is of value. In
this day, all t)lings shall stand on their own
merit, and not on a supposed authority.
10. And let not him, who speaketh with his
own spirit, judge others to be the same ; nor
yet the reverse of this; for no two in all the
world are alike.
11. To them that have not experienced
elimination of the spirit-self from the corporeal
self (trance), all speech is believed to be of
the corporeal senses only, or of a diseased con-
dition. Such men are not to be blamed for
their interpretation; rather shall ye pity them,
and not answer them.
12. For many such, even after death, will
not admit they are dead, because of the dark-
ness upon them.
13. It is wiser for the spiritual-minded to
keep to themselves, especially when commun-
. ing with J ehovih and His angels. For a
greater wonder than these will follow : Some
will enter the trance of the first resurrection,
and go in spirit out of the body, but only sub-
jectively; others will enter the trance of the
second resurrection, and go in spirit out of the
body objectively. And the first shall not be-
lieve but the second was like himself, going
only subjectively. No two men in all the
world have I created alike, saith Jehovih.
Even many, after death, are not capable of
entering the second resurrection objectively.
He, that is in subjective state, speaketh and
writeth from the earth, looking upward; he,
that cometh of the objective heavens, speaketh
and writ!,ith as one come down from My king-
doms to the earth.
14. Two conditions will manifest: Subjec-
tive spiritualists will affiliate with the world's
people, being deniers of the Ever Present Per-
son, and they will pursue earthly vocations
for self sake; but objective spiritualists will
be Faithists, believers in the Ever Present Per-
son, J ehovih, Whom they will worship not only
required of any man.
7. But this shall happen unto many: Learn- in words, but by abjuring self, and uniting
155
4 OAHSPE.
themselves in brotherhoods, for sake of doing
good unto others: These latter are the chosen
people of the Father of the kosmon era, and
they will become supreme in all the world.
15. These three peoples, the world's people,
the believers and the Faithists, have been in
all ages of the world. The latter only of them
all practiceth harmony and good works. Both
of the others are resistants, quarrelers and
warriors and disintegrators and breakers-down
of all things.
16. Yet, the Faithists, having faith in the
All Person, shall ultimately possess the whole
earth, and make it a paradise of peace and love.
17. As the first is bound in the flesh, and as
the second is bound by the hadan spirits, so is
the Faithist bound unto Jehovih, which is
emancipation. As the second can commune
with the spirits of the first resurrection, so can
the Faithist commune with the Father through
the second resurrection.
18. Nevertheless, this shall happen: The
second shall say: My angels are high, thine
are low ! Or they shall ask : How know ye
your light is higher than ours?
19. And the Faithists shall answer them,
saying : We know no high, no low. We give
up all things, in order to serve J ehovih by
doing good works unto our fellows.
20. And J ehovih shall judge betwixt them,
as to which is high or low ; not by their words,
but by their works.
21. And the signs of good works and self-
abnegation shall be as a witness before the
world; whence cometh the inspiration of each.
22. Let no man say, that only seers and
prophets and such persons as work signs and
miracles are under the influence of spirits ; for
even as much as these, so are other mortals
under the dominion of spirits. Yea, the infidel,
the disbeliever, the philosopher, the lawyer, the
judge, the preacher, the fanatic, and all others,
are more controlled by the spirits of the dead
than by their own personal spirit. And the
more a man's spirit is wrapped up in his own
corporeality, the more is he subject to vampires
and spirits of darkness.
23. Neither knoweth the philosopher whether
his.ideas come from Jehovih or from the spirits
of the dead.
24. \iVhosoever hath witnessed and knoweth
of a truth, that he hath seen the spirits of the
dead, that knowledge is impregnable. And
whoso hath entered the second resurrection,
even though in mortality, that knowledge is
impregnable.
25. But, whoso hath found the All Person,
his knowledge is greater than all. And none
below him can judge him. Neither can any
man attain to this knowledge, till he hath
passed through the other two conditions.
26. No man knoweth the Creator, unless he
hath proven the com1mmion of spirits. Neither
can any man rise to the second resurrection, till,,
he hath arisen to faith in the All One, J ehovih.
27. Neither shall the Brahman, nor Moham-
medan, nor Budhist, nor Kriste'yan join in the
second resurrection [communities - En.J on
earth or in heaven.
28. For they have not the doctrine of unit;
they are as a house divided against itself. Their
colonies and communities shall fail in all cases.
29. There shall be but one doctrine, which is
J ehovih, the All Person, who is Ever Present;
with good works done unto others, with all of
one's wisdom and strength.
30. And this shall prevail with the young;
whom, as orphans and castaways, ye shall
gather up in infancy, founding them in the
light of J ehovih, teaching them from the start
to sing and pray unto Him, in reverence and
fear and joy, that He may be glorified in their
purity and good works.
31. And they shall grow up of all national-
ities, and races, knowing not: This is mine, or
that is mine, or that is thine, but understand-
ing, that they own nothing, and that all things
are J ehovih's.

35. Wherefore, I have come to put these
doctrines away, and give them that which shall
prove itself potent in all the world.
36. That, which I proclaim, shall be pro-
claimed by the angels of the second resurrec-
tion, unto all nations and peoples.
37. My light is not to one people only, save
to the righteous, who serve the Creator by
doing good unto all men. In my sight, the
nations · of the divisions of the earth are as
one people only, brothers and sisters.
38. I take from all of them their idols, their
Gods; but I give them a greater, even the Cre-
ator.
39. I say to them: I suffered my children to
have idols; but now, that ye are men, put
away your idols, and accept J ehovih, Who is
the Creator of all.
40. Nor shall any man more say: I wornhip
the Brahman principle, or the Budhist princi-
ple, or the Ka'yuan principle, or the Kriste'yan
principle, or the Mohammedan principle. For
all of these have proved themselves to result
in war and destruction.
41. None of them have faith in Jehovih, but
faith in their armies of soldiers, and in their
weapons of death.
42. But I give unto all people one principle
only, which is to serve Jehovih. This is broad
enough for tlrn redemption and resurrection of
all men. And I will have none other.
43. Seek, thou, 0 man, to believe in the All
Person, \Vho is Ever Present, vVhose eye is
upon thee, vVhose ear heareth thee; for He is
the All One, vVho is the password to the high-
est of heavens.
44. And thou mayest call on thy idol at the
gates of my heavens, but the gates shall not be
opened unto thee. For I will have no quarrel
in my exalted kingdoms in heaven as to Gods
and Lords and Saviors.
45. Till thou art washed clean of them;
coming in spotless white, a servant of the Most
High, thou canst not withstand the light of my
kingdoms in heaven. . ·
46. But thou shalt return in spirit to the
earth, and abide in the church and temple of
thy chosen God, wandering about, in stubborn-
ness of .heart, a prey to drujas and vampires
and other angels of darkness.
CHAPTER IV.
THE NUMBERS OF THE JUDGMENT, IN THE
WORDS OF GOD.
H EAR the words of thy God, 0 man; I am
thy elder brother, the captain of heaven
and earth.
2. vVherefore, deplare I unto thee in this
day, the same shall be testified to by millions
of angels unto mortals ere one generation pass
away.
3. Of Brahman angels in the lowest of
heavens, as wanderers on the earth, there are
this day more than four thousand million.
4. Of Budhist angels in the lowest of heavens,
as wanderers on the earth, there are this day
more than seven thousand million.
5. Of Ka'yuan angels in the lowest heavens,
as wanderers on the earth, there are this day
more than three thousand million.
6. Of Kriste'yan angels in the lowest heavens,
as wanderers on the earth, there are this day
more than three thousand million.
7. Of Mohammedan angels in the lowest
heavens, as wanderers on the earth, there are
this day more than two tho.usand million.
8. Of Jewish angels in the lowest heavens,
as wanderers on the earth, there are this day
more than thirty million.
9. And of other angels, idolatrous and other-
wise, even on the earth, more than twelve thou-
sand million.
10. And of all these angels not one is above
grade five, in the first resurrection.
11. But of such as are below grade one,
there are more than six thousand million, being
mostly such angels as know nothing more than
babes, though, for the most part, they were full-
grown adults as to earth-life. Some are fetals,
some engrafters (professional re-incarnators),
who dwell with one mortal during his life-time,
and then engraft themselves on another mortal
during his life-time, and so on, calling them-
selves re-incarnated, and, in fact, knowing no
other heavens, being disbelievers in the All
Person and in my exalted kingdoms.
12. Such as are below grade one, thy God
bath classed as drujas, being spirits that have
not left the earth and are bound to mortals.
13. They inhabit mostly the oldest cities,
and places of filth and indecency; nevertheless,
they also inhabit the palaces of kings and
queens and emperors and popes and priests and
rich men.
47. Have faith, 0 man, in Him, vVho created
thee alive, about Him there can be no mistake.
Glorify Him by righteous works, having faith,
that even as He brought thee into life, so will
He provide unto thee, according to thy just
deserts.
14. Of grade one, there are hundreds of mill-
ions of angels strolling about on the earth,
758
THE BOOK OF JUDGMENT. 7
crying out: I want to go to Brahma, I want to
go to Budha, I want to go to Jesus, I want to
go to Kriste.
15. And I send my hosts of high-raised angels
to them, saying: Come ye to the kingdoms of
J ehovih, and be clothed and fed, and learn to
clothe and feed others, for this is the way of
resurrection.
16. But they will not believe, but turn away
in stubbornness of heart, even as ye of the
earth, saying: Nay, I will rise only by prayers
and confessions. I want to be changed in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and ·rise
and sit on the right hand of God.
17. And there are hundreds of millions who,
being dead, know not anything; but, through
belief in a judgment day, went to sleep, and
are ·waiting for the- trumpet of Gabriel to call
them forth.
18. And I send my exalted ones to them to
awake them up, and call them up; but they are
drunk with their faith, and they relapse again
and again, for years and years, for hundreds of
years! .
19. Fulfilling Jehovih's mandate, that what-
soever is bound on earth shall be bound in
heaven.
20. And, even as one drunken man on earth
enticeth another to drunkenness, so are there .
hundreds of millions of idolatrous angels, who
return to mortals and persuade them to their
same doctrines and to their same debaucheries.
21. Hear the words of thy God, 0 man, and
be wise in thy judgment: He Who created
thee alive, gave to thee of His Own Being. Be
thou steadfast unto Him, and thou shalt not
err, but eliminate thyself from the chance of
error.
22. He alone is unmistakably thy sure foun-
dation, in Whom thou shalt not be tripped up.
23. Sufficient unto thee and thy resurrection
is thy Creator. ·wherefore, in thy soul thou
shalt abjure all Gods and Lords and Saviors.
24. Neither shalt thou try to exalt His name
by adding thereunto any name in the shape
and figure of man, nor by any one of woman
born.
25. Seek thou to attain to His voice in all
things, and to obey Him for righteousness'
sake. Be not stubborn in thy conceit.
26. In thy singleness of purpose thou shalt
be ministered unto by the spirits of the first
resurrection; but, as thou unitest thyself in a
brotherhood on earth, in the name of J ehovih,
so shalt thou be ministered unto by the light
{)f my second resurrection.
27. But it hath been proved, and it shall be
proved again, that all brotherhoods on earth
founded on any of the idols in heaven, shall
not stand.
28. Because, there is no second resurrection
to minister unto them.
29. And all societies and constitutions and
by-laws ·founded by men, not capable of the
second resurrection, shall fail.
30. But whosoever establisheth, in the second
resurrection, which is the abnegation of self to
serve J ehovih, shall not fail.
CHAPTER V.
OF THE JEWS.
H EAR the words of thy God, 0 Israel.
Shut not thyself up against the wisdom
of thy elder brother, God of heaven and earth.
2. Nor magnify thou the ancient clays above
the present ; nor feign and say, thy God is
gone away to come no more forever.
3. Behold, thou hast gone forth as a little
man to battle against a giant. vVith thy sling
thou hast smitten him with thy ONE God,
Jehovih ! ·
4. Thou wast encompassed on all sides hy
a multiplicity of Gods; one by one, thou hast
overcome them, and cast them out.
5. The giant of the great beast, the false
Gods, lieth dead and cold at thy feet.
. 6. The nations of the earth cry out : There
is but one Great Spirit, Jehovih !
7. And I declare unto thee, 0 Israel, the
Voice of the I AM is not gone from the earth.
8. Through the seed of the Faithists have I
held up the Father's kingdom; by the voice
of my beloved founded Him in all the nations
of the earth.
9. Thy enemy exulted, saying : Behold, they

10. But thy Goel profited in thy footsteps,
and in the words of thy month : There is but
one Great Spirit, Jehovih !
11. And I have provided unto thee, after
the manner of thy forefathers, a place to
inhabit, where thou shalt not longer pay trib-
ute to the Gods of the idolaters.

potism, and inherit the wilderness of this land.
And they shall bloom as a new paradise before

thy sons and daughters to commingle with the
Faithists of all the races and tribes of men.
14. And thou shalt forsake the ways of the
world, and go, and live after the manner of
thy forefathers, in colonies, without kings or
rulers ; serving none, but J ehovih.
15. And thy people shall hold all things in
common, being neither rich nor poor ; master
nor servant. And thou shalt call out to the
idolater, saying: Come into my house, and be
one with me. Behold, there is but one Cre-
-ator; thou art my brother.
16. And it shall come to pass unto thee, 0
Israel, the way of thy people shall be open,
and they shall be delivered out of the bound
kingdoms of the eao.t.
17. Because, for two thousand years, _thou
hast not gone forth with the sword to possess
any new country, and establish thyself, thou
art glorified before thy God.
18. Because of thy long suffering, thou shalt
find peace through the light of my kingdoms.
Behold, a new cycle is upon the earth; thy
people shall find proof of these my words.
19. My angels will come into the houses of
thy people, and they shall talk with them,
face to face.
20. 'fhink not that this book is mine only
revelation in this day; within thine house, 0
Israel, shalt thou prepare unto the voice of thy
God.
21. For I will raise up many seers and
prophets amongst thy people. And they shall
testify to my words, on all sides.
22. Judge thou not, 0 Israel, who are apos-
tates before thy God. I say unto thee : He,
that forsaketh J ehovih and worshippeth mam-
mon and the ways of the world, is an apostate
in my sight. For, even though they maintain
the rites and ceremonies, they have forsaken
the spirit and truth of my commandments.
23. Whereas, many who have forsaken the
rites and ceremonies in search of higher light,
are more to the way of J ehovih.
24. Do they not, indeed, keep the rites and
ceremonies, but drink to drunkenness, and eat
to gluttony, feasting on flesh, wherefrom they
have taken life ?
25. And they engage in selling wine, and in
dealing in stocks, after the manner of the idol-
ater. \Vhilst thy forefathers were scrupulous
to labor, and bring forth out of the earth,
wherewith to feed and clothe man.
26. And they say : God prospered me !
27. Wherein they falsify me, and blaspheme
J ehovih and His kingdoms. I say unto thee,
they are prospered by satan; and their pros-
perity is the wages of bondage in heaven.
28. And because of their wickedness, they
have led my people to disbelieve in my justice
and the plans of my kingdoms.
29. For which reason, more are they apos-
tatized in my sight, than such as are good,
who say : There is no God.
30. Throw open thy doors, 0 Israel; my
angels stand at the threshold. These, my
words, which I have told to thee beforehand,
shall be corroborated by hundreds of thousands
of witnesses from my heavens.
31. Seek for the resurrection of thy soul, 0
Israel, that J ehovih may be glorified in thee,
forever and ever !
CHAPTER VI.
OF RESURRECTION. IN THE WORDS OF GOD.
W HETHER on earth or in heaven, the
same rules apply unto both:
2. He that serveth himself one-half, and
serveth others one-half, shall stand grade fifty.
3. He that serveth himself three-quarters,
and others one-quarter, shall stand grade
twenty-five.
4. He that serveth himself one-quarter, and
others three-quarters, shall stand grade seventy-
five.
5. He that serveth himself only, shall stand
grade one.
6. He that serveth others wholly, shall stand
grade ninety-nine.
7. And whoso serveth accordingly, himself
or others, shall stand in grade even as his
works manifest.
8. To serve one's self is to work for one's self;
to strive for one's self, to think of one's own
self, as to what will profit one's own self only.
9. To serve others, is to do good unto others;
to help them; to teach them; to give them joy
and comfort. This is the service of J ehovih.
10. But there are some who arn below the
grades; who seek to do evil; who seek to
make others unhappy; who delight in crime
and pollution. These, if mortal, shall be called
Druks, and if spirits, shall be called drujas
[druj, singular - ED.].
11. After such manner, in general, are the
grades of my heavens of the earth, atmospherea.
12. Grade one is on the earth; grade fifty, .
midway betwixt the earth and the emancipated
heavens, etherea.
13. Grade twenty-five is one-quarter way up

THE BOOK OF JUDGMENT. 9
from the earth, toward etherea; but grade
seventy-five is three-quarters way upward,
toward etherea. And so on, relatively, grade
and place of ascent intermediately.
14. But grade ninety-nine is the highest at-
mospherean grade, preparatory to entrance into
the company of the all pure in spirit.
15. But good works alone are not sufficient
to attain the highest grades, for they require
knowledge and capacity to unfold others.
16. To accomplish which, those of the
higher grades shall oft return to the lower,
and learn to lift them up. For this is that
which calleth the ethereans in the times of
resurrections.
17. Wherein the righteous, w)io .are yet mor-
tal, begin at once lifting up their fellows.
18. Which labor is to the spirit as exercise
is to the mortal body, that which giveth
strength.

as to the place thy spirit will rise in the time
of thy death.

2. These are my exhibits which I pl.ace be-

3. And thou be a rich man, and adorn a city
by donating unto it a park, with statuary and
pleasure-walks, hoping to glorify thyself there-
by, and be praised by men; therein thyself
bmieth thyself in the first resurrection. And
the act lowereth thy grade instead of raising it.
4. For in whatsoever thou givest, thou shalt
consider, first, the lowest of the low, whether
they have bread to eat, and a place to sleep :
And the sick, whether they have attendance
and good provision.
5. Aud thou be a rich man, and contribute

his act of casting the money away was a judg-
ment against him.
14. He who giveth, saying: H ere, thou beg-
gar ! doeth a good corporeal act, but an evil
spiritual act. H e lifteth up with one hand,
but injureth with his tongue. Such an act
detracteth from the grade of that man.
15. A certain rich man, being converted to
do good works, went and built a score of soup-
houses to feed the poor gratuitously.
16. And all the poor people of that town
went therein and were fed. But the next
year, behold, there were twice as many poor.
And the rich man built another score of soup-
houses, and they were all fed.
17. But the next year, there were still twice
as many poor people to feed ; but the rich
man had exhausted his means, and could feed
none at all.
18. Judgment is therefore rendered against
that man for his supposed benevolence.
19. For, whilst he did a little corporeal good,
he did a great spiritual wrong, because he
lowered the grade of manhood and womanhood
in those that he fed. His benevolence pro-
moted dependence,
20. A rich man founded a place of labor for
the poor, who had nothing to eat and nowhere
to sleep. And he said unto them :
21. The Creator hath given you hands to
work with; come ye, be men and women.
22. And they went and worked and earned
their living.
23. Judgment is rendered in favor of that
man, for he raised the spiritual grade of the
poor. This is a benevolence that extendeth
into heaven.
24. Let thy charity be to the sick and help-
less, but be thou wise in directing the able-
bodied to help themselves.
25. For all charity tendeth to lower the self-
respect of the receiver, and casteth him lower
in the grades in heaven.
26. Certain ones d.epend 011 alms, not having
either sickness nor yet strong bodies. Never-
theless, were they aroused, they could support
themselves.
27. When thou givest them regularly, they
depend upon thee. '.rhese become beggars in
the lowest grades in heaven.
28. That which thou givest them accounteth
against thine own grade. Better is it for thee
and for them, that thou arouse them from their
degradation.
29. To do this tenderly and mercifully, is a
great virtue ; to do it cruelly, is a great crime.
30. Consider not so much what thou shalt
do to raise thine own grade, but what thou
canst do to raise the grade of those withi11 thy
reach.
31. Remember, all men and women are thy
brothers a11d sisters, a11d thou shalt labor to
make them make themselves a glory unto the
Creator.
CHAPTER IX.
REMEMBER thy Creator and the mag-
nitude of His creations. Before Him
thou art but an atom, and as only one small
creature.
2. Nevertheless, a multitude of people make
a 11ation, with cities and hamlets.
3. These are also graded by thy God, accord-
ing to the ascendency or the declension of the
whole.
4. If a city, then the grades of all the people
shall be summed together in a scale of one
hundred. ·
5. And if a nation, then the grades of the
cities and hamlets, and of people of isolation,
shall be summed together in a scale of a
hundred.
6. And if half the people are above grade
fifty, and half below fifty, the grade of that
people shall be fifty.
7. If one-quarter only, then the grade of
.that people shall be twenty-five.
8. On the basis of individual grades, shall
be the grades of a city and of a nation.
9. And the behavior of a city or a nation
shall be graded in the same way, after the
manner of an individual.
10. A certain nation built alms-houses and
asylums sufficient for the needy, and, by its
tyranny, made an equal number of needy ones.
That nation raised not its grade for the good it
had done.
11. Another nation built no alms-houses, but,
by its wholesome laws, there were none needed.
That nation raised its grade many-fold.
12. And yet another nation maintained a
standing army, in order to m&intain itself.
That nation stood in grade one only.
13. The place of this last nation, in entrance
into the es world, shall be grade one, which is
the animal region, which is on the earth.
14. Whoso dwelleth in such a land, though
he have a good individual grade, shall suffer
deduction in the ratio of the grades of different

17. If a city, or nation, or a kingdom in
heaven do unto others in resurrection, then it

18. But, if there be no gain in the good that
any of these do, they shall receive no grade.
19. But, if they increase in raising indi-
vidual grade, then are such cities and nations
rising in grade.
20. Consider thy nation, 0 man, one gener-
ation with another; an<l as the relative propor-
tion of individual grades rise or fall, so shalt
thou determine whether thy nation is ascend-
ing or falling in grade. Number its paupers
and criminals as to increase or decrease.
21. Consider not its wealth, nor its ships, nor
its armies, nor its great buildings. These all
together are only one grade, and are of no
value as to the spiritual grade of its people.
22. For the strength and life of thy nation
depend on its spiritual grade. Pursue this,
and thou shalt prophesy truly as to the growth
or the downfall of a nation.
23. Pursue this also with regard to the na-
tions of the earth, and thou shalt determine
the relative place of thine own nation in the es
world.
CHAPTER X.
THOU art remembered, 0 man, by thy God,
and admonished and instructed for thy
soul's sake that thou mayest.become a glory to
thy Creator and to thyself.
2. Hear, then, thy responsibility and the ex-
tent thereof, and consider the magnitude of
thine own grade on earth and in heaven.
3. Which is in proportion to the power and
the distance of thy reach. Which I have also
graded unto all men on earth and in heaven.
4. If thy Creator give thee strength to carry
four men on thy back, and thou wilt carry but
one, thou shalt be one-quarter grade. But,if thou
carriest the whole four, thou shalt be full grade.
5. One man hath wherewithal to feed one
man ; another hath sufficient for a thousand;
and another for a hundred thousand. These
are the distances of the reach and power of
these men, which is the extent beyond which
nothing more can be exacted of them, on earth
or in heaven.
6. Yet, when they have all fulfilled these to
the utmost, they shall be therein only equal in
grade. .
7. But, if they fail in their parts, the respon-
sibility of one shall be a hundred thousand;
and another shall be ten thousand, and the
least shall be only one. These are the debts
men owe the people of the nation, the city and
the hamlet.
8. Consider, therefore, the darkness of the
people of thy nation; the poverty and the
crime; and judge thyself as to thine own re-
sponsibility.
9. And this rule shall apply both Oll earth
and in ·heaven. And thy grade of responsi-
bility in heaven shall begin even in the same
place thou established it on the earth. Wherein
thou wert short, thou shalt labor ; wherein
thou didst fulfill, thou shalt rejoice, and be
without compunctions.
10. Also shall this rule be with the king and
queen and emperor, and all rulers who have
means and power ; and the responsibility shall
extend to all the people of the kingdom or
empire.
11. Nor shall this responsibility be escaped
by death; but the bondage in heaven shall be
according to the avoidance of the trust im-
posed.
12. Consider, then, what thou shalt be en-
cumbered with iil the es world.
13. Pursue this philosophy, and thou shalt
determine what shall be the labor of the king
and the queen and the great ruler, after they
have died, and entered the es world.
14. Find the grade of their respective domin-
ions, and thou shalt determine, by the ascension
thereof, the duration of their bondage in the
first resurrection, whether it be fifty years or
five hundred years.
15. But if such emperor's dominions be in
declension instead of resurrection, then, on his
entrance into heaven, he shall be at the mercy
· of the spirits of his kingdom, who shall be in
wait for him, and he shall not escape them.
16. Some other heavenly kingdom shall
deliver them; otherwise, they fall into anarchy
and madness (hell).
CHAPTER XI.
REMEMBER thy Creator and the compre-
hension of His kingdoms ; and be consid-
erate of the words of thy God :
2. All men profess to desire resll!:rection ;
763
12 OAHS.P.rl:.
they hope to ascend to exalted heavenly
spheres.
3. Yet, many will not even try to exalt
themselves.
4. One saith in one breath : To not eat the
flesh of anything created alive, is the highest.
5. But, straightway, he feasteth on fish and
flesh.
6. One saith: To return good for evil is the
highest. ' .
7. But he doeth evil even before the sound
of his voice is hushed.
8. And yet, he will find fault with his Cre-
ator, if holy angels promise him not a high
seat in heaven.
9. And there are others who constantly pro-
fess to have the higher light; bnt they go
about tattling, and making evil remarks of
their neighbors.
10. Yet, many of these do good unto others,
giving to the helpless; verily are they both
rising and falling, in regard to the resurrec-
tion.
11. The measure of the grade of such shall
be by weighing the whole behavior as to its
result in the community wlwre he abidieth.
And this rule shall apply, bot11 on earth and in
heaven, to all such people..
12. There are men who do great good unto
dieth with them. And they enter the es world
even as if they had died in infancy.
18. They shall stand grade one, because
owing to their weakness of spirit, they must
need be habited on the earth for many years.
19. There be others, who are forever talking
of heaven, and co11Sulting the spirits of the
dead, who are, nevertheless, low as to good
works, and low in. holiness of heart. These
shall be graded the same as liars and hypo-
crites.
20. For in prophecy [calculations - En.],
thou shalt estimate the sum of all the virtues
and vices of thyself, and of thy neighbor, and
of the whole city, or state, or even the world;
and accredit the grade in ascension or declen-
sion, and thou shalt compare one generation
with another, as to the increase or decrease of
its spirituality.
21. And thou shalt know of a truth the
standing of the whole world.
22. And from tills, thou shalt also determine
the time,. when man came on the earth; how
long the race will survive and bring forth; and
the time he shall become extinet as to the

9. And this animal heaven I graded, one, in
the order of my heavens.
10. For I saw that man on the earth had
delight in them; and I provided unto him for
his es'yan period, that he might rejoice in
remembrance of finding his loves.
11. And I made the animal heaven to rest on
the face of the lands of the earth even the
same as the place of the es'yan in grade one.
12. Remember, 0 man, thy Creator gave to
every animal a season on the earth; but He
limited them to a time to become extinct. Even
so, and of like duration made I a heavenly
period for the spirits of animals companionable
to man.
13. But for man I provided heavens above,
where he should rise as to place, even as he
riseth, as to goodness and knowledge.
14. Magnify thy perception, 0 man, that thou
mayest comprehend the kingdoms of thy God.
Behold the example thy Creator set before thee
in the fashion of the earth.
15. In large bodies, He placed the lands; in
large bodies, He placed the oceans. Not in
little hillocks of land and little puddles of water.
16. Even larger than these are the divisions
(plateaux) of the heavens of thy God; the
heavens of the earth are separated by atmos-
pherean oceans.
17. I fill not the air of the firmament with
angels scattered about; but I give unto them
regions habitable and home-like. And I grade
them suitable to the resurrection of .the spirits
of the dead.
18. Consider the work of thy Creator, and
the knowledge and symbols He placeth before
thee. Thou holdest up a lump of salt, and it
is solid and of dimensions; but cast it into
water, and it is seen not, but dissolved and lost
as to thy perception.
19. And thou beholdest the earth, which hath
dimensions also; but the ethe, thou seest not.
As water is to salt the solvent, so is ethe to
corporeal things the solvent. By slow velocity
holdeth the solid earth its form; yet, in ethe,
external to the body of the earth, the swift
velocity of corpor is magnified into dissolution.
By vortices in ethe are these things accom-
plished.
20. In the atmospherean regions which ro-
tate with the earth, behold, there are many
plateaux larger than the earth, being habitable
heaven& belonging to the !33-rth. Their compo-
nent parts are like unto the earth, and they are
adapted to the abode of angels even as the
earth is for mortals.
21. And yet, 0 man, these are but the atmos-
pherean heavens. These are the dominions
given into the keeping of thy God. These are
my kingdoms and my heavens for a season.
22. As thou, 0 man of the earth, sailest thy
ships abroad over the ocean, and coming to a
new land, going ashore, dost settle thy people
thereon, and it becometh a new kingdom, even
so doth thy God in the heavens of the earth,
in the plateaux of this vortex.
23. Remember the magnitude of thy Creator's
works and the symbols He set before thee :
Where the clouds float high, it raineth not;
where they drag on the face of the earth, it
raineth daily.
24. Consider the habitations of the resurrec-
tions of the dead which are in the keeping of
thy Goel.
25. Even as to the square of the distance
away from the earth, so are the grades of my
resunections.
26. According to the exaltation of man's soul,
so shall he inhabit the places I have made.
27. According to his own soul's growth and
development, so shall he ascend in my king-
doms, outward away from the earth ; grade
unto grade adapted I them.

heaven in grade one, even as the spirits of the
beast~ of the field.
17. 'fhy present knowledge shall be void,

my a·.1gels who are wise and strong shall take
thee about, in hada, the heavenly plateaux that
rest on the earth, and divert thee with things
proximating betwixt the two worlds, that thou
mayest be made to comprehend thyself and thy
Creator's work.
18. As thy corpor was fed on corporeal sub-
stances, so, then, shall thy young spirit be fed
on atmospherean substances, which thy guar-
dians shall provide unto thee.
19. Consider the wisdom of thy Creator, Who
sent me to fetch thee into places of delight.
20. 0 that I could take thee to the highest
heavenly places! That thou coulclst stand be-
fore me, and talk face to face !
21. But, even as a newborn child is unsuited
to feed on corn and nuts, thy spirit is as a
starveling in high heaven. And I take thee to
the nurseries where I have provi.ded for thee
according to thy weakness.
22. Thy mother was provided unto thee
before thou wert born; and my heavens
arranged before thy spirit entered , therein.
Thou shapedst not thyself in thy mother's
womb; and, behold the perfection of thine
every part.
23. Trust thou in thy Creator, but seek thou
also to go with Him, and thou shalt attain
easily to the highest places He created for thy
glory.
24. 0 that thou hadst not contaminated thy
corporeal part by the flesh of the beast and the
meat of His living creatures ! This is as one of
the stones that covereth up thy soul, and block-
adeth thy way to the upper grades.
25. Thy young spirit must remain withtn
the atmosphere of the animal creation for a
long season; like unto like, hast thou fashioned
thy Rpirit to the flesh of thy body.
26. According to the atmosphere of things,
as to the purity and sweetness, behold, thy
Creator hath fashioned them in relative ascent
above the earth. That which is impure resteth
on the earth; that which is pure, is upward
and high.
27. Consider the place of the hells of the
spirits of the dead, and the weapons of war-
fare in their hands. As the corporean is to
corpor, so is the spirit as to the atmosphere of
the earth.
28. 0 man of the earth, consider what thou
puttest into thy mouth, for the atmosphere
thereof is the food of thy spirit. And the
habit thereof will be entailed on thy spirit for
a long season after thy mortal death.
29. If thou hast been a gross feeder on flesh,
thy spirit will seek to linger in the atmos-
phere of gross feeders still dwelling on the
earth. The slaughter-house and the cook-house
and the eating-house shall be the places of thy
spirit's resort.
30. And thy spirit shall feed therein and
thereon ; and thy companions shall be millions
and millions of drujas [like vultures that flock

of darkness.
31. 0 man, I have heard thee, in thy full-
ness, say : I must have my flesh-food; I must
have my wine and beer and tobacco and opium.
32. I say unto thee, if thou hast not strength
in this day, neither shalt thou have strength
to-morrow. What strength shalt thou gain by
the loss of thy corporeal body?
33. Consider thy corporeal body as a ship, in
which thy spirit is sailing across a wide sea of
water. Better that thy spirit learn to acquire
strength whilst it hath a corporeal body to ride
in. After death, it floateth in the direction
thou hast shaped it. Neither hast thou power
to go against the current.

but half the matter. Look for one who is
pure in spirit.
13. Whoso is pure in flesh and in spirit shall
bring forth heirs unto resurrection, which shall
be little or no bondage to the spirit, after death.
14. But, whoso marrieth for the earth only,
shall bring forth heirs of bondage. And profli-
gacy and debauchery and sin shall come upon
the heirs of that marriage.
15. The spirits of such fathers and mothers
shall fall in the grades in heaven; and long
will be their bondage in hada.
16. Flesh-eaters seek their partners accord-
ing to the impulse of the :flesh, as to the temp-
tation thereof, or according to riches, or caste,
all of which are earthly considerations and for
themselves only, and in no regard as to what
their heirs will be.
17. And their offspring come forth in dark-
ness; they are void of su'is, void of heavenly
aspiration, and dumb as to the voice of the
Creator.
18. They go about, saying: I see no All Per-
son! I hear not the Unseen ! Nay, I believe
not that any man hath seen or heard Him !
19. Herein was it revealed to thee of old:
Some are born of the beast, and some are born
of the spirit. Which I declare unto thee, 0
man, is the interpretation of all the poverty
and crime and war and licentiousness there is
in the world.
20. This is the fountain-head, which thy God
would bring to the understanding of all people.
But there are many, even hundreds of millions,
that cannot be made to appreciate this.
21. Nevertheless, the kingdom of peace and
righteousness shall not cover the earth over
until this is understood by all men and women.
22. Whoso understandeth this, let him wed
accordingly ; and let such people be as societies
to themselves. In this day, no mark of cir-
cumcision is required; but men and women
shall converse on the ways of the Creator
understandingly.
23. And, when thou hast children born unto
thee, thou shalt more consider the place of thy
habitation, as to temptation, than thy dominion
over them.
24. To dwell in a city, which is full of
iniquity, thou shalt be a tyrant over thy heirs,
restraining them from liberty, in order to keep
them from vice.
25. And in this, thou wilt be a sinner also.
26. But dwell thou in a place of purity, and
give unto them liberty and nobleness. They
shall not be thy slaves.
27. In this matter, thou takest upon thyself
a new grade, according to thy heirs and thy
God-ship over them.
28. Be cautious in thy proceedings. He,
who created thee alive, gave thee no sinful
desires.
29. Because thou art not yet a completed
man, these things are.
30. Thou shalt find joy in thy talents, and
profit in the wisdom of thy God.
31. To perfect thyself is a great glory; to
raise up sons and daughters who are -also per-
fect, is a ten-fold greater glory.
32. For, it is the fullness of the life thy
Creator gave into thy keeping; which is the
glory of heaven and earth.
CHAPTER XV.
OF the abundance of thy Creator's creations
be thou appalled, 0 man!
2. Consider the inhabitants of the whole
earth, and the number of a thousand millions
brought into life every thirty-three years.
3. Compute thou the number for a thousand
years, and for ten thousand years.
4. And, yet, the earth is not full.
5. And the heavens of the earth are yet even
as if scarcely habited. Thousands of plateaux
there are, with no angels to dwell thereon.
6. But to induce the spirits of the dead to
rise up from the earth, this is the work and
the glory of thy God. ·
7. To make them put away earthly desires,
to become pure and wise and strong and adapted
to the sublimated spheres, what an endless
labor for thy God and his exalted angels.
8. As thou, 0 man of the earth, holdest to
the desire for earthly things, thou entailest
thyself in heaven, and canst not rise upward.
Even so is it with the great harvest, the thou-
sands of millions of angels born of the earth.
9. If thou stand a pyramid before thee, wide
at the base, equal to the height, such is the
manner of the proportions of the spirits of the
dead on their entrance into the es world. .
10. Consider, then, 0 man, how sparse are
the settlements in the upper kingdoms of the
earth's heavens, compared to the numbers in
the lowest grade. And remember thou, the
percentage of inspiration that cometh to thee,
from this grade, which is doubly degraded in
the cities and great capitals.
11. Know thou, 0 man, that all cities built
by men, soon or late, fall into destruction.
768
·rHE BOOK OF JUDGMENT. 17
Search into the generations, as to the grade of
mortals, and thou hast a type of the spirits of
that city, chiefly as to the lowest grades. But,
remember, the highest grades of angels go away,
whilst the lowest remain. As the spirits of
one generation are to the form of a pyramid, so,
not so will be the spirits of that city in the
next generation.
12. But, in proportion to the increase of the
mortal city, and in proportion to the raising up
of the second, third, fourth and fifth grades, so
will be the relative increase in the proportion
of drujas that dwell in that city.
13. And, in time, all holiness passeth away
therefrom; and, when thy God abandoneth
that city for a day, taking hence his holy
angels, the people fall into anarchy, or run with
brands of fire, and burn down the city.
14. And the hundreds of millions of drujas
lose their anchorage on the earth, and thy God
and his exalted ones march them away.

they inhabit in heaven, and the manner of their
occupations. .
21. And if thou inquire of them as to earthly
things, let it be as to ho·w thou mayest help the
poor and distressed.
22. For, if the angel that talketh with thee
be a druj only, thy discourse shall, in this way,
awake him to see his own shortness.
23. And if they be high-raised angels, they
shaH understand the working of thy soul, and
they will provide unto thee for thy everlasting
exaltation.
24. Be upright before thy Creator and thy
God, who know thy weakness. Emulate them
in all thy doings, for this is the way of resur-
rection, worlds without end.

subterfuges of satan (self), to palm off words
for works.
10. All such preachers and priests and con-
verts are still tarrying in the depths, - grade
one.
· 11. H ear thou thy God, and weigh his words
in the balance, and be not blinded by the tricks
of satan.
12. A preacher, receiving a good salary,
giveth half his money to the poor, and the
other half to the church; and his people say:
0 what a good man!
13. And straightway they raise his salary,
and they present him a good house, where he
feasteth sumptuously every clay, thanking God
for his own prosperity.
14. Now, I say unto thee, that that preacher
contributed nothing to the poor. The money,
he gave away, was not his, but the fruit of
false doctrines.
15. Because he practiced not labor ; but as a
beggar and a vampire obtained his money, not
for work, but for words, he was false before
J ehovih.
16. To serve thy God, or to preach and prac-
tice the words of thy God, require not great
oratory or education. I require not colleges
to brace me up; nor preachers, that serve not
the Creator.
17. One crieth out: Come to Goel! or: l\'Iake
thy peace with the Lord ! But he himself
would not share his house with the poor of his
own church.
18. I say unto thee : All such are either
hypocrites, or deceivers of their own souls.
19. Except thou usest thy hands, and bendest
thy back in practice, and in producing some-
thing in the world, and contributing it unto
others, thou art none of mine, nor knowest the
way to come to me, nor to make peace with
me.
20. It hath been said of old: Do unto others
as thou desirest should be done unto thee ;
also, to return good for evil, and to sell all
thou hast, and give to the poor, and, love thy
neighbor as thyself.
21. And these words are well known; but
who is there that practiceth them?
22. vVherein the words are impotent and of
non-effect. ·
25. Did thy God limit thee, saying: Do
thou this, in the present condition of society ?
The way was open for another condition; but
thou soughtest not to find it. '.l'hou wouldst
not give up thyself, and live in a brotherhood.
U ncler the name of liberty, thou .heldest fast
to satan and his haunts, saying: I am willing to
serve the Creator, but I will not sacrifice my
liberty.
26. And thou sellest thyself to self, which
sh;:dl follow thee into the next world.
27. Know then, 0 man, that whoso would
rise into my organic kingdoms in heaven, shall
teach himself the first lesson of liberty, which
is to free himself from self.
28. H e shall not say: I want this; or I must
have that; or, I can.not have self abridged; or,
I will suffer no dictation.
29. I say unto thee, all such men are already
in the bonds of drujas and the throes of hell.
30. But thou shalt say: H ere I am, 0
J ehovih, Thy servant! Appropriate Thou me
whichever way I can do the most good unto
others ! Myself is no longer any considera-
tion.
31. This it is, to be a Faithist in the Father.
32. If an exalted man marry a woman be-
neath him, he can lift her up.
33. But if an exalted woman marry a man
beneath her, he will pull her down.
34. E ven so is it with the righteous man,
that weddeth to the world ·and liveth therein:
soon or late, it will pull him down.
35. But, if the righteous man go with his
fellows into a separate place, and wed himself
to J ehovih and His ways, then shall that
righteous· man be lifted up, And, moreover,
he shall be a power to lift up the world.
36. Shall a b1,ide not live with her husband?
And they that choose the Creator, live with
Him?
37. I say unto thee : If thou do not live in
a brotherhood on earth, thou shalt not soon
find one in heaven.
38. But thou shalt unite thyself with such
as are compatible with thee; with whom thou
shalt live equal in all things, wherein thou
canst do unto them as thou wouldst be done
by, loving them as thyself, returning them
goocl constantly.

themselves by their labor; but in J ehovih's
service, their practice is by prayers and con-
fessions: words, words, words !

condition of society, to do these things !

kingdoms.
41. Even for them that are yet unborn shalt
thy sacrifice be.
42. In which shalt thou ·consider that it is
for the resurrection of others, and not for thy-
self, that thou art chosen of J ehovih.
43. For herein lieth the key of all resurrec-
tions; which is to labor for others; to induce
them to assimilate unto J ehovih, and with
one another.
44. The words of thy God are not for the
glory of any man ·under the sun, or for any
angel in heaven, but for J ehovih.
45. Thou hast had revelation sufficient since
thousands of years ; and sacred books with
most holy doctrines. And, yet, many that
know these well, come into the es world as low
as drujas, and as wandering spirits..
46. Thou shalt judge thyself; thy spirit is
as a manuscript in thine own handwriting;
thou art daily writing thy grade and the place
of thy abode in heaven.
CHAPTER XVII.
REMEMBER the words of thy God, 0 man,
and be reasonable in thy understanding.
2. Whithersoever thou buildest a city, and it
increase in inhabitants, it equally increaseth in
pauperism and crime. Neither hast thou any
' doctrine under the sun to provide against this.
3. Bnt I have now opened the book of knowl-
edge before thee. The place of my habitation
and of the line of my light and of my holy
angels I have made plain.
4. Thou mayest travel a thousand other roads,
but none other shall be blessed with the light
of my countenance.
5. As thou sayest at the door of the college:
Young man, neither prayers nor confessions
shall graduate thee in my house, to be com-
panion to such as have passed on before thee.
6. So say I at the gates of my exalted heav-
ens, unto the inhabitants of the earth : Only
by knowledge and righteous works, done unto
one another, shall ye be able to endure the
light of my kingdoms.
7. Now, it shall come to pass, early in the
kosmon era, that many shall be gifted to heal
by laying on of hands. And they shall say:
Behold, the lost gift is returned! Have I not
clone a good thing in the world?
9. The healing of the sick may be compared
unto giving alms to the poor, and saying:
Have I not done a good work? ·
10. I say unto thee, these things were of the
past cycles. They shall now consider what
shall be done to prevent sickness. This is
better than to heal. They shall now consider
what shall be done to prevent poverty. This
is better than giving to the poor.
11. I have not come to heal and treat the
diseased in flesh or spirit; nor to re-establish
any of the ancient doctrines or revelations.
12. I am not a patcher-up of old garments.
13. I am not an apologizer for ancient reve-
lations, nor have I anything in common with
what is past. ·
14. Neither their doctrines, nor sacred books,
nor their Gods, nor Lords, nor Saviors are any-
thing before me.
15. I am not come to captivate the ignorant
and unlearned. Nor am I come to call sinners
to repentance. Nor to convert the debauchee,
nor to convert the profane man, nor to con-
vert the harlot.
16. Sufficient have been other revelations
unto all these.
17. Nor have I come to say: Behold, this is
my book ! And there shall be none other!
18. But, behold, I come to found J ehovih's
kingdom on earth. I come to the wise and
learned. And not to one man only; but to
thousands.
19. That which I am uttering in these words,
in this place, I am also uttering in the souls of
thousands, and I will bring them together.
20. I do not command, saying: Thou shalt
believe, because I, thy God, hath said it, or
revealed it in this book.
21. I come as thy elder brother, in the name
of J ehovih. I show thee how thou canst live
without the governments of man. And how
thou shalt live, in order to join in my resur-
rections.
22. Let not the Faithist of this day say: I
will purify the government! I will leaven the
whole mass!
23. I say unto thee, thy God laboreth not in
such method. The cure is, come thou out of
Uz, and be thou clean.
24. Whoso hath more faith in Uz, let him
remain in Uz; whoso hath faith in Jehovih,
let him come into His kingdoms.

who hath learned this? They profess Him in

gregations of spirits have put away uncleanness
and selfishness; which is the first labor. And,
after this, they shall learn to practice fellow-
ship in union, for the resurrection of others.
16. Flatter not yourselves, that, because ye
wear fine cloth, and ye preach, that ye are not
responsible. also. Nor hope, that when ye be-
come spirits, ye shall ascend suddenly into
places of delight. Ye are marked by your
God!
17. Your -souls are being written upon with
your deeds and works and words ; a.nd ye shall
see yourselves as in a mirror, and of your own
accord shun my kingdoms of light.
18. Because ye have learned words, and
practiced only in words, behold, I come in this
day to command practice in works. Not for a
pittance, but for all ye have.
19. Behold, 0 ye destroyers of religion, ye
perverters of the word of your God.
20. I come to give ye a religion wherein all
men can be as brethren.
21. Even the infidel shall accept the Creator
and good works. For he, being the fruit of
your behavior, is even in the foregroi.md in the
march of my armies.

THE BOOK OF JUDGMENT. 21
5. But alas, how different ye are this day !
Ye patronize the man of wealth ; ye boast of
the riches of your congregations !
6. Ye receive salaries, and ye dwell in fine
houses ; my doctrines ye sell as merchandise !
Ye have fine temples and fashionable audi-
ences, and ye curry favor with those who are
in aflluence.
7. Ye go not to the drunkard's den, nor to
the unfortunate woman ; these ye take not in
your arms, saying : My brother, my sister,
come with me, I will show you the kingdom of
God ! 11
8. Behold, I have come to you -in spirit and
in truth, but ye put me off, saying: Is not
the first duty to one's own household? Is not
self-preservation the first law ?
9. Now, I answer you: These questions
spring from the beast, and not from the spirit.
10. Neither availeth it you one jot or tittle,
to rise at break of day and recite prayers all
day, nor to say: God help the poor! or: Blessed
art thou, my God !
11. When ye cannot purchase one another by
flattery, how hope ye for the favor of the Al-
mighty, by praise and prayers and flattery ?
12. Behold, the selfishness of man hath
made the world a place of wretchedness. The
people are in misery and want.
13. Go, then, quickly, to them, and provide
a remedy. This is the new religion I give
unto you: Demanding sacrifice of you, and
your congregations, of all ye have, that is not
in use and actual need.
14. And ye shall judge the limit thereof,
remembering that whosoever is bound on earth,
is bound in heaven.
15. I have drawn aside the veil of death,
your sons and daughters, your fathers and
mothers, the dead and the living, stand face to
face.
16. And the angels are testimony unto you,
that your doctrines, as ye practice them, are a
blasphemy against the Almighty.
17. Ye persuade yourselves and your congre-
angels of your own blood and kin, are ye ac-
cused.
19. Ye have no personal knowledge of
heaven, and, in stubbornness of heart, ye dis-
pute with my seers and prophets, who can
prove before you, they have power to see un-
seen things, and to hear that which ye cannot
hear.
20. Ye study spiritual things with your cor-
poreal senses; neither have ye capacity to see
and hear the spirits of the dead. How much
less, then, shall ye presume to interpret J eho-
vih and His kingdoms ?
21. Now, behold, I come in this era, not
· only to declare to you, that the time of preach-
ing is at an encl, save wherein it is practiced
in deed as it is spoken in word, but also to
prophesy to you, that many of you will give
up your calling, and preach no more.
22. And your temples and churches and
meeting-houses shall be turned into consulta-
tion chambers, to find remedies against pov-·
erty, crime and debauchery.
23. And the congregations shall be enrolled,
and, at the meetings, they shall be inquired
after, to see if they are in need. And they
shall have volunteers, who shall go about
seeking out the helpless and distressed, and
providing for them.
24. So, that, instead of the congregations
sitting to hear your sermons, they shall come
as co-workers for Jehovih's children.
25. This is the new religion, which I give
unto you; and, moreover, let it be a prophecy
to you of the words of your Goel. For there
is no such congregation this day in all the
world; and yet, ere this generation pass away,
this shall be proven before you.

30. Neither shalt thou, henceforth, swear by
any book under the sun; nor by any God, nor
Lord, nor Savior, nor spirit, nor idol, nor

Creator.
31. To J ehovih only shalt thou covenant
thyself, and this shalt thou do in thine own
way only, and not according to any book, or
bible, or priest, or church, or spirit.
32. Behold, the olden times are passed away;
and thy God setteth aside the bondages of the
olden times also.
33. Sufficient were they for the times they
were created. A man shall not be bound as a
child ; neither shall the judgment of man be
bound by the things that were intended for
man before he attained judgment.
34. Hast thou not beholden the signs of the
times? What I here give in words, J ehovih
manifesteth over all the length and breadth of
the world.
35. None can stay the hand of the Almighty
or gainsay the words of thy God.
CHAPTER XXL
GOD DECREETH AGAINST INFIDELITY.
GOD said: Hear the words of thy God, 0
man. In the ancient times, I came as a
father to a child, dictating unto man.
2. Now, that thou hast attained to compre-
hensive judgment, Jehovih hath inspired thee
to liberty, and to think for thyself, and to con-
sider what is best for thee.
3. And thy God cometh not now as a dic-
tator, but as thy elder brother, with ample ex-
perience.
4. And I say unto thee, after the manner of
thy professors in the college to their graduated
classes: Behold, thou art free; go thy way,
and no longer hope to hold thy God accountable
for thy behavior.
5. For, with thy freedom, thou also attainest
to responsibility.
6. Think not, because I emancipate thee
from the God and Lords and Saviors of the
ancients:
7. Aud from the bibles and sacred books of
the ancients; and from the ancient command-
ments and injunctions, that, as a consequence,
thou art not bound in fidelity to thy Creator.
8. More art thou bound now than before ;
for thou shalt not, henceforth, throw the re-
. sponsibility of thy conduct on to this man, nor
that man, nor this God, nor Lord, nor Savior,
nor holy book, nor bible, nor p1·iest, nor church
decree.
9. So, that thy fidelity to thy Creator and
to thy fellow-man, in righteousness, love and
good works, shall be the most sacred stttdy of
thy life.
10. And thy example from day to day shall
be a perpetual register of thy accountability;
verily shalt thou be a living sermon before men
and before .J ehovih.
11. And, wherein thy behavior detracteth
from the grades of thy fellow-men, thou shalt
be bound in the behavior of those that copy
after thee, and, for the shortness thou bringest
them into, thou shalt suffer for them in time
to come.
12. Beware, 0 man, for this rule applieth
unto all the generations of men: That, by sud-
den emancipation from an old condition, man
runneth into another extreme, from which
spring libertinism and licentiousness.
13. For which reason, rather shalt thou pro-
claim before the multitude the responsibilities
of the new condition, than try to win their ap-
plause by proclaiming their emancipation from
the old.
14. Because I have opened the heavens, the
spirits of the dead return to thee, and com-
mune in thy household ; flatter not thyself
that the whole of the Father's kingdoms are
revealed to thee, and that the angels :vho con-
verse with thee, can make plain the dominions
of the higher heavens.
15. Many of these shall return to thee, say-
ing: There is no hell, no satan, no God, or
Lord, nor anything in this world to make thee
afraid. For, of a truth, the hell they looked
for, they found not; nor found they a God, nor
Lord, nor Savior, such as they had hoped to
find. And, for this reason, such angels are
jubilant for the time being.
16. Nevertheless, a time shall come to them
also, when they shall tire of dwelling on the
earth, in the places of their mortal kin; and
they shall seek resurrection into more exalted
places, where 'visdom and purity dwell. Then,
indeed, shall they begin to comprehend the
ways of the kingdoms of the Almighty.
17. And they will cry out in pain ; pleading
for pity, compassion and help. And after that,
when they come to thee, they will also pro-
claim, even as thy God now doth: That the
commandments must be fulfilled :
18. To love the Creator above all else;
19. And thy neighbor as thyself;
20. Sell all thou hast, and give to the poor ;
775
24 OAHSPE.
21. Return good for evil ;
22. Do good unto others, with all thy wis-
dom and strength ;
23. Abnegate self in all respects ;
24. Making thyself a servant to thy Creator;
25. Owning or possessing nothing under the
snn; ·
26. And look into thy soul, to judge thyself
constantly, to discover where and how thou
shalt do the most goocl;
27. Complaining not against J ehovih for any-
thing that happeneth;
28. Making thy neighbor rejoice in thee;
29. Making thyself a:ffiliative ;
30. Without self-righteousness above anyone;
31. Being a producer of something good;
32. And learn to rejoice in thine own life,
with singing and dancing andwith a jovial heart,
paying due respect to rites and ceremonies,
that all things may be orderly before Jehovib.11
33. Remember the words of thy God, 0 man,
when angels or men advise thee against these
commandments, they have little to offer thee
that will promote the harmony of the state.
34. Consider, therefore, that whatsoever pro-
moteth the greatest harmony and wisdom within
the state; hath also been discovered and is in
practice in the higher heavens.
35. And, wherein it hath been proven to
thee, that a state divided against itself cannot
stand, even so are the heavens above not
divided, but as a unit.
36. Judge, then, 0 man, when one spirit
cometh to thee preaching one thing, and another
spirit cometh to thee preaching another thing,
their words are proof that they have not yet
entered the harmonious heavens of thy God.
37. And it is because of the inha1:mony of
thine own soul, that thou art open to these con-
flicting messengers. This is infidelity against
the All Person, J ehovih. And such conflicting
spirits deny the Person and the Unity of the
Almighty.
38. Let not thy emancipation from the bond-
age of the doctrines of the ancients lead thee
into infidelity against J ehovih.

3. Now, behold, J ehovih hath sent me, thy
God, to answer thy prayer.
4. I demand of thee, that thou hast no favor-
ite doctrine above thy neighbor;
5. And that thou art servant to no God, nor
Lord, nor Savior, nor church, unacceptable to
any man in all the world.
6. But, that thou servest J ehovih with all
thy wisdom and strength, by doing good unto
thy fellow-men with all thy might.
7. That, because thou art strong, or wise, or
rich, thou understandest, that thou shalt use
these excellences for raising up such as have
them not, believing, that J ehovih so provided
thee to that end.
8. Consider, 0 man ! Thou hast a kingdom
[government - En.] already. Wouldst thou
have two kingdoms?
9. Behold, the kingdom of man hath its
power in armies ai;id ships of war.
10. The kingdoms of thy Father have not
these, but love, wisdom, righteousness and peace.
11. I demand of thee, that thou shalt give
up thy army and navy. Art thou prepared to
say: To whom smiteth me on one cheek, I turn
the other to be smitten also?
12. Is thy faith still more in weapons of
death, than in the Voice of Everlasting Life ?
Esteemest thou thy army and navy more to be
depended on, than J ehovih ?
13. Art thou willing to sacrifice thy time
and money and self-interest for sake of Jeho-
vih's kingdom?
14. Use thy judgment, 0 man. Since the
time of the ancients till now, the only prog-
ress towards the Father's kingdom hath been
through sacrifice.
15. What less canst thou expect ?
16. If thou sellest what thou hast, and
givest to the poor, behold thy neighbors will
imprison thee for a madman.
17. If thou abnegate thyself and labor for
others, they will persecute thee, and revile thee.
18. If thou shouldst profess to love thy
neighbor as thyself, they would mock at thee.

CHAPTER XXIII.
GOD JUDGETH uz, COMMONLY CALLED THE
WORLD'S PEOPLE.
GOD said: I am not come in this era to
judge the drunkard, the harlot and
thieves and murderers ; these are known unto •
thee, 0 man.
2. I am not come to repeat former judg-
ments against whorn all men understand to be
sinful; for, behold, I gave governments into
the hands of men, to deal unto such them-
selves.
3. But I am come to the leaders of men ; to
kings, queens, emperors and presidents; and
to philosophers and men of learning, priests,
rab'bahs, cardinals and popes; and to mer-
chants, bankers, manufacturers, farmers, ship-
pers and hucksters.
4. Such as pass unscathed before the laws
and governments of man, and are reckoned
passably wise and good before the world.
5. And not even to such of these as are bad
men in disguise, who escape condemnation be-
fore the courts, by cunning and stratagem.
6. But I am come to the best of all of them,
be they true Brahmans, true Ka'yuans, true
Budhists, true Kriste'yans, or true Mohamme-
dans.
7. Therefore, 0 man, hear the judgment of
thy God against them : They are not united
and affiliated as brothers.
8. But the best of all of them are as so many
individual entities pulling in different ways,
every one for himself.
9. The Brahmans are not communal ; the
Ka'yuans are not communal; neither are the
Budhists, nor the Kriste'yans, nor the Mo-
hammedans; neither the philosophers, priests,
merchants, nor any one people in all the world.
10. There is no fullness of heaven amongst
any of them. They are divided into thousands
of ideas and projects.
11. Now, hear me, 0 man, and consider the
wisdom of thy God : Satan is wiser than any
of these I have named.
12. For satan hath made armies of soldiers
communal. He hath discovered the power of
and peoples of the earth : Alike and like the
angels of heaven minister unto mortals (save
wherein thy God and his Lords provide espe-
cially otherwise), the inorganic heavenly re-
gions to the inorganic inhabitants of the earth.
16. Now, behold, I said unto thee, in the
olden times, try the spirits, and see, if they be
of God.
17. For the angels, who wander about on the
earth know not my kingdoms, and they deny
me, and deny all order and system ·and dis-
cipline in heaven and earth.
18. And each and all such angels, coming to
mortals, do so on their own account, assuming
any form and name they may find acceptable
unto men.
19. Such angels have not yet passed the first
resurrection ; nor belong they to any disci-
plined kingdom in heaven.
20. And all mortals, such as I have named
to thee as the best and highest of mortals,
enter the es world (after death), only into the
inorganic regions of heaven.
21. Neither can they enter the second resur-
rection until they abnegate self and learn affilia,.
tion.
22. Therefore, after death, they remain, for
the most part, in their former places : The
merchant in his counting-house, the banker
in his bank, the shipper in his place, the pope
in his place, the king in h_
is, the farmer in his.
23. Neither have they power or wisdom to
go to any other place ; and they stroll about,
like one that hath lost his master. Neither
will they affiliate with other angels ; but, in
stubbornness and moroseness, persist in work-
ing out an individual identity, until they are
broken down in sorrow and darkness, which
may be in a few years, or it may be hundreds
of years.
24. And, then, my holy ones come to them,
and carry them away to my es'yan schools.

so desire, be would not be of the God-head, but
of himself.
. 9. Moreover, none of the members of such a
brotherhood shall go off, of bis own accord, to
minister as an individual to the inhabitants of
Uz. But each and all in the brotherhood shall
concentrate their profits and force unto one end
and object.
10. Even so, 0 man, are my organic heavens;
all the members of each heaven being as a unit
with the whole, they waste not their strength
and time in isolated endeavors.
11. Whereby, when a prophet foolishly
boasteth to thee, as to having some high-raised
angel, with a loud-sounding name, as his special
guardian and guide, know thou such prophet
is in the hands of drujas, who have not entered
my heavenly kingdoms.
12. Neither hath it ever happened ou the
earth with any individual man, raised up by
me or my Lords for a specific work, like Moses,
or Ka'yu [Confucius-En.], or Sakaya, or any
other, that they knew of or boasted of any
especial angel over them ; but all of them ex-
perienced the light, which was as a pillar of fire.
13. Even such is the manifestation of the
second resurrection through my Lord and his
Holy Council.
14. And the manifestations are not like
those of a mere magician; but the accomplish-
ment of something that embraceth nations,
empir.es and mighty peoples.
15. For this reason, 0 man, I declare unto
thee that the Father's kingdom is now being
founded on earth, and the mortal manifestation
thereof is near at hand.
16. But it shall not come in this era, as in
the past, through any one great leader-forth;
but it shall appear as a spontaneous light, per-
meating the soul of thousands ; and they shall
come forth, establishing J ehovih in truth and
fullness. ·
17. Now, therefore, 0 man, consider the
judgment of thy God against all such as are
called the best of men, the wisest of men, the
greatest of kings or queens or popes; for none
of these have even passed the first resurrection
in their own practice.

2. And they allot certain ones as leaders and
overseers, making themselves inquisitors over
one another, in hope of purifying their thoughts
and aspirations, constantly trapping one another
for shortness, and, then, submitting to petty
punishment and inflictions, hoping thereby to
check evil thoughts, words and actions.

their entrance into the es world.
5. Yea, even in that same college (convent
and nunnery), shall they be immured after
death, by thousands of drujas who inhabit the
place, who profess to have some scheme of
projected salvation.
6. All such people are the manifestation of
darkness instead of light. Jehovih created
man with capacity for developing talent to do
good unto·others.
7. Now, behold, these ascetics labor for
themselves in these foolish proceedings; they
do not these things in order to meliorate the
condition of their neighbors. Neither have
they shown, in a single instance, where a bene-
fit resulted to the state in consequence of their.
practices.
8. They call their initiations sacred, but I
declare unto thee, they are a blasphemy against
Jehovih. They are as a _
snare for the impris-
onment of the mind and the soul.
9. And, after death, these people are pre-
vented by their drujan masters from entering
heavenly places of resurrection, becoming,
instead, slaves in the es world, to pursue such
calling and practice as may be put upon
them.
10. For the same rule holdeth on earth and
in heaven, as regardeth the bondage of the
mind. If, by imposing rites and ceremonies,
and by the stratagems and cunning of mortal
priests, they can be captured .on earth, even so
can they be retained in bondage in heaven.
11. And it happeneth with them, that even
as they honestly believe they are right on
earth, so will they persist they are right in
heaven, even willingly submitting to cruelty

one star of light whereby thou mayest deter-
mine truth and wisdom.
13. Whatever doctrine showeth self as the
chief consideration, even if it be for obtaining
wisdom or supposed purity for self's sake, is
not of J ehovih.
14. The aborigine, that roveth foolishly in
the forest, standeth higher, therefore, before
thy God, than doth the nun or the ascetic. For
though the former liveth for self only, yet he
is not bound in spirit. ·
15. In all things, thou shalt weigh the object
and end aimed at, and the final result; and,
wherein self standeth as a part, or whole con-
sideration, know thou such matter is not of
Jehovih, but of satan.
16. It is not sufficient for the apologist of
satan to say: 0 we dwell in the colleges (nun-
neries and convents), in order to pray for
Uzians.
17. But thou shalt weigh their prayers also,
and thou shalt estimate the value thereof by
what is accomplished. And thou shalt prove
whether their prayers provided harvests of
wheat and corn, and food and clothing for the
poor, and education for the unlearned, 01· any
other thing that was good.
18. Be thou not put off by the cunning of
satan's words in the mouths of priests or
popes; but look matters in the face, and be
thou a God thyself in discerning things that
meliorate the condition of man.
CHAPTER XXVII.
GOD JUDGETII CIIARITIES.
GOD said: A certain man built a dam
across a river, using only stones, but no
cement. And the water ran through the crev-
ices, rendering the dam worthless.
2. Then came certain neighbors to him,
saying: Thou shalt apply cement to the crev-
ices.
3. So, the man went to the lower side, and
applied cement ; but, lo and behold, the result
was only temporary, for the water washed the
cement away. ·
4. Again his neighbors said unto him :
Apply thou the cement at the upper side, and
the water will carry it into the crevices, where
it wilhemain with good effect.
5. And the man did so, and, behold, the dam
was a complete structure.
charities. Thou mayest apply thy riches, and
thy estates for charity's sake, but of no profit
under the sun.
7. When the man applied the cement, where
it was not self-sustaining, the waters washed
it away.
8. Wherein thou appliest charity, and it
be not self-sustaining, judgment is rendered
against thee.
9. When the man applied the cement
towa.rd the fountain, it became self-sustain-
ing.
10. Where.in thou appliest charity, and it
be self-sustaining, judgment is rendered in thy
fa'rOl'.
11. When thou meetest thy neighbor on the
road, and he hath fallen down, and broken his
legs, and cannot stand, consider how foolish it
would be, to lift him up, and, then, let him fall
again. Flatter not thyself, that such would be
charity.
12. And yet, how much of the so-called
charity of the world is of that kind.
13. Thou mayest feed three drunkards' fam-
ilies, and flatter thyself thou hast done charity
worthily; but, if thou bast not done that which
will make them no longer in need of charity,
thou hast done little.
14. Another man may not feed them, but he
may reform them, and put them in the way to
be self-sustaining. Such a man will have done
a hundred-fold greater charity.
15. To open the way for employment and
industry, this is the greatest of all charity.
For, by these avenues, charity will not be
needed, even for the aged, nor for orphans. .
16. Consider, then, how little any people
have to boast of for charity's sake.. Even
their asylums and poor-houses and homes for
the aged and helpless are so many witnesses of
condemnation against the people who built
· them; because some great wrongs and evils
existing within the state were also built by the
people in the first place.
17. They are as paint and plaster, hiding and
redeeming them, in some measure, for the sins
of a wicked people.
18. And, when such a city saith: Behold
us! what a charitable people we are! I say
unto thee, that that city understandeth not the
kingdom of thy God.
19. Yet, thou shalt avoid going to the other
extreme, doing nothing, which is worst of all.
But thou shalt go to the root of the matter;
thy charity shall be directed to prevent the

of thy missionaries in all the earth, and behold,
there was not one place, which thou hadst es-

withal he was mighty above his neighbors,
and none of them could regain their offspring.
2. And a certain rab'bah inquired of J eho-
vih concerning the matter. And Jehovih an-
swered him, saying: ·whatsoever he coveted
and hath taken, suffer him to keep. What he
hath taken exultingly shall be a bondage unto
him in sorrow, in time to come; for he shall
provide according to law.
3. And it so happened that a famine came
upon that land, and, according to the laws, the
rich had to provide unto the kin of their own
households.
4. And, behold, the rich man's possessions
were consumed by the neighbors whom he had
robbed, and great sorrow came upon him.
5. Such, 0 man, is the way of the dominions
of men. A mighty king stretcheth forth his
hand to possess his neighbor's kingdom, and
Jehovih giveth it unto him.
. 6. And that king exulteth, saying : Behold
my possessions and my power !
7. Hear, now, the judgment of thy God, 0
man : Soon or late, all things answer unto J e-
hovih in a way man imagineth not. Whoso
coveteth and receiveth, is bound unto J ehovih.
8. And, when a king possesseth himself of a
new country, he not only receiveth its riches
but its misfortunes also. The profits and losses
are all his.
9. And the sins of the people are his, and are
henceforth upon his head.
10. And, when a famine cometh upon that
country, the king shall be responsible therefor.
11. And he shall supply every want of the
people, or judgment shall be upon his head.
12. And for all of the newly acquired sub-
jects, who may be in sickness or distress, the
king shall be judged.
13. Moreover, judgment shall pursue that
king into the es world; and the subjects he
took unto himself on earth shall be his in
heaven to redeem, and provide for, and edu-
cate.

king and queen and emperor, and every other
ruler in all the world.

22. And they shall be responsible to all
their subjects for deaths resulting from wars,
wherein the subjects were used for the glory
and power of the king. And for all famines,
pestilences and all other injuries that come
upon the multitude through any shortness in
the king's government.
23. And for the poverty of the people, and
for their ignorance and crime; nor shall the
king escape retribution for any good thing he
might have done, but did not accomplish.
24. And for all the profit and service the
king receiveth on earth from his subjects, he
shall render back to them an equivalent profit ·
and service, either on earth or in heaven.
25. Let not the king or other ruler, any
longer flatter himself that death e:ffaceth the
bondage of man unto his subject and neighbor.
26. Behold, by opening the gates of heaven,
I have given you the glory thereof; and, with
it, I also give you the responsibilities.
27. I have brought the angels to your door;
they bring you news of great joy, and bring
you also the afflictions ye cast upon them.
28. I told those of the olden time, that sword
should answer sword; war should answer war;
and peace receive in.peace.

upon dominion ; and this shall be ratified in
time to come by every ruler on the face of the
earth.

5. Hear thou, then, the judgment of thy
God, for it is that which thou shalt put upon

6. Which is, that thou shalt be bbtmd in

7. And this is the penalty for neglecting, on
earth, to fulfill the light that was given unto
thee: Thou shalt, in heaven, accomplish with-
out money, what thou couldst·have done with
money. And the difference it requireth to do
a thing without means, as compared to what
might be clone by one with means, is the extra
bondage and duration that shall be upon thy
head ancl soul.
8. To all men, who set out with a promise
to accomplish charity, or any good for the
resuri·ection or melioration of man, and fail to
do it, the same judgment shall be upon them
in heaven. Nor shall they rise above the first
resurrection until they have fulfilled the same
in all particulars. Thus shall they judge
themselves in heaven.
9. It is not sufficient for thee, 0 man, to say :
I saw not my way clear as to the best method
of doing a thing, and so I waited.
10. The·commandment of Jehovih is upon
thee, to do what thou canst, according to thy
highest light and ability to accomplish. In
this respect, then, thou shalt find no excuse,
because thou knewest not the best way.
11. Neither mattereth it, the amount of thy
riches being less than another man's riches.
12. Nor shalt thou find an excuse, in say-
ing : I did more according to my means than
did my neighbor.

on are all the heavens of J ehovih, higher
and higher, until the inhabitants thereof and
therein become very Lords and Gods.
2. Nevertheless, hear thou, 0 man, the wis-
dom of thy God, and be appreciative of the
way of resurrection being opened up unto thee.
3. Now, I declare unto thee, there are angels

very old person, that child is devoured of its
substance. In such case, the old person is
fetaled on the young child ; the old person is
said to live by fetal.
6. Now, hear thou, 0 man, the judgment of
thy God : Half the people, born into the
world, including still-births and abortions, die
in infancy. Therefore, there are a thousand
million angel infants fetaled on the earth every
thirty years.
7. These angels never obtain objective
knowledge of the corporeal earth, but are com-
pelled to learn subjectively earthly things
through mortals upon whom they are fetaled.
8. Judgment is rendered against all nations
and peoples on the earth for this great dark-
ness, these early deaths. And, because these
angels are thus bound to mortals, and cannot
go away from them until such time as mortals
die, mortals are responsible, and bound to train
them up by examples of righteousness and
good works.
9. Now, aside from such angels, there are
such as are slain in war, whose minds are in
chaos, who, dying in the heat of passion and
fear and anger, become wild and bound on
battle-fields, or, mayhap, stroll away into
deserted houses and castles, and are lost, be-
wildered and unapproachable.
10. Of these, there are hundreds of millions;
and they are in all countries and amongst all
peoples in the world.
11. They are distracted and tormented with
their own fears and bewilderment.
12. Judgment is rendered against all nations
and peoples in the world who engage in war,
thus bringing these afflictions upon the angels
of heaven.

i6. And yet, aside from angels who are in
chaos, there are hundreds of millions who are
in declension, instead of resurrection. Such
angels are those who in mortal life were
whipped and tortured in prisons, or, mayhap,
were hanged, or otherwise put to death.
17. These angels take delight in evil instead
of good. Sometimes they go about singly,
and sometimes in gangs of hundreds and even
thousands.
18. In olden times, the false Gods used such
angels to fulfill curses on mortals ; and to carry
poison in the air, and inoculate mortals with
foul diseases.
19. Behold, in this day, my angels have
shown thee that they can bring flowers and
ponderous bodies ; even so could the false
Gods with their trained warrior angels, who
be a hundred years or a thousand years, yet
this, my judgment against them, shall not be
put aside.
23. Neither shall any king, nor queen, nor
any other ri1ler in all the world, impress as a
soldier any man who is unwilling to engage in
war. And whosoever obeyeth not this my
judgment shall not rise above the first resur-
rection in heaven whilst war remaineth on the
earth.
24. Neither will I more consider the prayers
of any king, or queen, or any other ruler, or any
nation or people in all the world, who engage
in war, offensive or defensive, or who aid or
abet war in any way whatsoever.

GOD JUDGETH AGAINST EXCLUSIVENESS.
G
OD said : Hear the judgments of thy God,
0 man; look thou upon all the world
with the eye of a God.
2. Be thou comprehensive in judgment over
all nations and peoples upon the earth.
3. Jehovih hath said: Out of My very self
created I all the living ; brothers and sisters
made I them, from the members of My body.
4. J ehovih hath said: In the early days of a
world, behold, I provided unto . man different
continents and islands, separated by mighty
waters, that man, in one division of the earth,
might not interfere with man in another divis-
ion of the earth.
5. J ehovih hath said : Beholu, one nation
and people I allot to one civilization, and
another nation and people I allot to another
civilization. Separately, on the different di-
visions of the earth and on the islands in the
seas, situated I the different peoples I created.
6. Jehovih hath said : But, when the world
groweth older, and man attaineth to wisdom, I
say unto him: Build thou ships, and sail across
the waters I created; go visit thy brothers and
sisters in the different di visions of the earth.
7. J ehovih bath said : And man mastereth the
ocean, and cometh to his brothers and sisters,
afar off, and I say unto man : Because thou
hast mastered the oce:m, let this be a testi-
mony unto thee, that there shall be no barrier,
henceforth, between all the nations and peoples
I created.
8. J ehovih bath said: In kosmon I come,
saying: Be ye brethren upon the face of the
earth and upon the waters of the earth; these
are the legacies I bequeath unto My children.
9. J ehovih hath said: Be ye a help and
a profit unto one another, judging wisely of
the differences which circumstances and places
of habitation have developed in the races of
man.II
10. Now, I, thy God, 0 man, declare this
judgment unto thee: Inasmuch as thy wisdom
hath surmounted the corporeal barrier, the
ocean, betwixt thee and thy brother, it is meet
and proper, that thy soul surmount the barrier
of prejudice against thy brother.
11. And that, instead of making laws against
him, thou shalt do the opposite of this, and
aside, or set backward, the seasons of the
Almighty.
13. Wherein thou dost this, affliction shall
surely come upon thee.
14. Behold, I have made the heavens of the
earth universal; and established heavenly
roadways around about the earth, that the
angels of the different nations and peoples
may be as angels of universal heavens, to help
one another.
15. Wilt thou make a law to incite the enmity
of the spirits of the dead against thee ? And
open the door for still more aggressive wars.
16. Shall. the laws of man interdict the
march of J ehovih ?
17. Now, behold, when kosmon came, I said
unto thee: Come with thy God; peacefully
shalt thou knock at the doors of Chine'ya and
Japan, and they shall open unto thee.
18. This, thou accomplished; and those who
had been exclusive hundreds of years, turneg
from the olden ways to welcome J ehoviil's
hand in thy coming.
19. Now, I declare unto thee, I will not
more have exclusiveness in any of the nations
and peoples in all the world.
20. Neither shall there be taxes and duties
of one nation or people against another.
21. Behold, thou hast asked for the Father's
kingdom to come on earth as it is in heaven, and
I will give unto thee. As thou hast prayed, so
will I answer thee, in the name of J ehovih.
22. Thou shalt not serve both, J ehovih and
mammon. Neither shall the light of my heav-
ens be with thee, save thou heedest my judg-
ments.
23. I will have all the ports open and free,
nor shall there be partisan taxation, in favor
of one nation against another, nor of one peo-
ple against another people.
24. It is not excusable for thee to say: Lo, the
poor foreigner will come and consume my riches!
25. Thou shalt say the opposite : ·welcome,
my poor brothers and sisters ! Whatsoever is
mine, is yours also. Come ye, and dwell
within my country '; it is ample, and Jebovih
will provide unto us.

2. But, when his children attain to be men
and women, man no longer holdeth a law
over them, for they are become his equals, as
brothers and sistern.
3. Even so, in the aneient times, provided I
thee, 0 man, with governments and laws for
different nations and peoples.
4. Nevertheless, I said unto thee: Let thy
government be as a father over the people, and
not as a separate matter against them.
5. But thou hast disobeyed my command-
ments; thy government is as one thing, and
thy people as another thing. That which
should be one entity, thou hast made into two.
6. Thy governmenthath become a sepamte self
from the people; and the people are as servants,

ects and schemes for their own profit and glory.
people, and neglecteth providing means for the
development of the talents created with all.
12. In these respects, 0 man, governments
are measured and graded by thy God. And,
whenever a govemment setteth up itself to en-
force and strengthen itself by violence against
justice unto the multitude, behold, l turn away
from that government; and I call away my
Lords and holy angels.
13. And, thereupon, drujas come upon that
people, and the people fall upon their govem-
ment, and destroy it. .
14. If a government be a king only, and he
have no holy council [parliament - En.], then
the responsibility of the shortness is wholly his.
15. But, if the king have a holy council, then
the responsibility for shortness lieth partly
with the king and partly with the council.
PLATE 97. - GRADES.
7. Since the earliest days, all the govern-
ments of man have drifted into this.
8. When a government no longer filleth the
grade, according to the advancement of the
people, behold, thy God witbdraweth his heav-
enly ptotection from that govemment. And,
straightway, the people run into anarchy.
9. Lay not the blame of anarehy and revolu-
tion and assassinations on the people; my
judgment is against the government in all
cases. These conditions of vengeance are but
the fruit resulting from the government's diver-
gence from the will of J ehovih, and the march
of His light.
10. II As, for example, the offspring of inhar-
monious parents, or of parents wrapt up in
selfishness, are lower in grade than their pred-
ecessors, even so do the subjects of a king
decline in grade in proportion to the preven-
tion of liberty and the neglect of general
instruction. II

ment wherein it provideth not liberty to the

each and every member of such council shall

17. Hear the wisdom of thy God, 0 man,
and consider the way of righteousness in the
governments of mortals :
18. The nearer the twain are to being one,
that is, the government and the people, the
.nearer they are like unto my heavenly king-
doms.
19. The more diverse the government is from
the people, the farther it is from the kingdom
of thy God.
20. Let this be a guide unto thee, 0 man, in
prophesying the change and the overthrow of
governments: According to the square of the
distance a government is from Jehovih (which
is Righteousness) so is the quickness ·of its
coming change or destruction.
21. Think not these matters are governed

36 OAHSPE.
by chance or accident: J ehovih is Perfect
Righteousness; the all Everlasting.
22. He is All One. For a people and their
govemment to attain to be all one with each
other, this is great strength, with a long exist-
ence and internal peace.
23. 'rhis, also, shalt thou consider, 0 man:
All governments are tending toward oneness
with one another. This is the march of J e-
hovih. None can stay Him.
24. Consider, then, what is wisdom between
governments : To make themselves reciprocal
toward one another.
25. A government that setteth up itself for
itself, and against other governments, is a sel-
fish government. And thy God rateth it the
same as a selfish man, being diverse from J e-
hovih and His kingdoms.
26. Judgment is rendered against such a
government. Neither my Lords nor my holy
angels shall bless that government.
27. Governments that practice affiliation, to
bring about reciprocal brotherhoods between
governments, are on the right road toward the
Father's everlasting kingdoms.
28. Flatter not thyself, -0 man, that these
matters can escape the observation of thy God.
'l'he affairs, legislations, laws, treaties, and all
things whatsoever that governments accom-
plish, are known and recorded in the heavens
of the earth. · And the leaders, kings and coun-
cils, shall, soon or late, face them; and they
shall judge of their own fullness or shortness
in serving J ehovih in righteousness and wis-
dom.

to practice within the king's dominions ; with
rates for fees and rights and privileges.
5. But these laws and governments were for
the past eras; they were righteous in the first
place, for they shaped man's judgment, toward
perfecting himself.
6. But, behold, a new time is in the world;
from the acquisition of knowledge a new liberty
bath been born into the world. And it crieth
out on every side : Throw open the doors unto
all trades and occupations; behold, the multi-
tude are sufficiently wise to judge themselves
as to whom they shall patronize.
7. Judgment is rendered against the laws
and governments of man in all cases where
they prevent the liberty and choice of man to
his vocation and knowledge.
8. It is not sufficient for thee to say : Behold,
the public will be taken advantage of by igno-
rant pretenders. Thou hast no right to say
what the public will suffer, and thus base a
law on prospective damage.
9. When the public have suffered, and when
they, themselves, demand protection by such
laws, then shall such laws be made. To make
such laws beforehand, is to sin against J ehovih.
10. It was said of old: Thou shalt keep holy
the Sabbath day. And it was defined what a
man should not do on that day.
11. Judgment is rendered against that law;
nevertheless, I put not aside the practice.
12. But the time bath now come when man
shall judge himself as to whether he will or
will not keep any day sacred.
13. Moreover, man shall not, henceforth, be
accountable as to whether he keep or not keep

form to the rites and ceremonies, then that child
shall be thus baptized in the name of J ehovih,
but not in the name of God, nor any Lord, nor
a Savior, nor an angel.
17. This is wisdom, 0 man, to have no law
or government between man and wife.
18. This is ignorance, to have a law between
man and wife.
19. Yet, because there are bad men and bad
women who do marry, it hath been found neces-
sary to have a law between man and wife, as
regardeth their duties.
20. But consider how wrong it is ·~o have a
law between a good man and good wife, as
regardeth their duties. Better is it for them
to be thrown upon their own love and judgment.
21. After such manner gave I governments
and laws unto all peoples. To the bad and
evil-minded, rigid laws, with many details; but
to the wise and good, I come now as an eman-
cipator, saying: Go ye, without laws and gov-
ernment, fulfill your destinies according to your
own judgment, that ye may be an honor and
glory to J ehovih.
22. In kosmon, man shall not be longer driven
in yoke and harness, he shall stand upright be-
fore Jehovih, practicing his highest light with
rejoicing, being a free man, and a brother to
his God!
23. Behold, the Uzians have a custom of eat-
ing bread, and drinking wine, saying, after the
manner of the worshippers of Baugh-ghan-ghad,
of old: Eat of this, for it is my flesh; and,
drink of this, for it is my blood, signifying,
that that they do, was commanded by me, God
of heaven and earth.
24. Judgment is rendered against this cus-
tom, with abhorrence; moreover, it shall be,
henceforth, known as blasphemy against J e-
hovih.
25. Thy God hath never commanded man to
eat flesh and blood, nor pretended that bread
and wine were flesh and blood, nor commanded
them to be eaten in remembrance of the flesh
and blood of any man born of woman.
26. Also have they a custom of decorating
and draping themselves in crape, and charac-
terizing the same as a sign of mourning for
the dead.
27. Judgment is rendered against such cus-
tom, but without prohibition.
28. Jehovih createth alive, and Jehovih
taketh life away, for all things are His.
29. Remember thy Creator with wisdom;
and neither in thy dress nor habit shalt thou
censure Him for what hath been.
30. Neither curb thou the full sorrow of thy
heart and thy soul, because thy brother or
sister, son or daughter, or father, or mother
hath passed away.
31. But remember, J ehovih is over all His
works, and provideth wisely unto the living
and the dead.
32. J ehovih hath said: To man I gave an
earthly body that he might learn earthly
things ; but death I gave to man that he might
rise to the inheritance of My heavenly king-
doms.
33. He appointeth a time unto all; to some
an hour, to some a year, and to some a hundred
years ; every one fulfilleth to result in wisdom
and happiness, and for the glory of the Al-
mighty.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
GOD SHOWETH HOW HE HATH WROUGHT.
GOD saith: Behold the work of my hand,
0 man : As thou findest an old house, no
longer habitable, thou sendest workmen to pull
it down, and, then, thou sendest laborers to
clear away the rubbish.
2. And, afterward, thou bringest builders,
and they lay a new foundation, larger and
broader than i;he old one, and, thereon, they
build thee a new edifice, adapted with new
improvements unto the increase and require-
ments of thy family.
3. Even so, hath thy God labored, for hun-
dreds of years, to prepare unto the generations
of this day.
4. For I saw, beforehand, that man would
circumscribe the earth, and that all the nations
and peoples thereof would become known to
one another.
5. And I beheld also, that, in the coming
time, which is now at hand, the old edifices of
doctrines and creeds and religions, as of the
Brahmans, Budhists, Jews, Ka'yuans, Kriste'-
yans and Mohammedans would not fulfill the
requirements of man.
6. And now, behold, 0 man, the wisdom of
J ehovih previously : He had permitted corrup-
tions and contradictions to creep into the
sacred books of all of the said great religions,
purposely and with design, so as to make easy
the work of thy God.
7. And when I saw that the coming together
of nations and peoples would require a new
religious edifice, I perceived, also, that the old
ones must be cleared away.
8. And, behold, I, thy God, went to work
789
38 OAHSPE.
systematically, inspmng man to accomplish
even what man hath accomplished.
9. I raised up scholars and infidels against
these religions ; inspiring them to attack the
corruptions and. contradictions in the sacred
books of all these peoples.
10. And, in the same time, that I sent
infidels against the Jewish bible, I sent infi-
dels against the Hindoo bibles, and against
the doctrines of Brahma and Budha and
Ka'yu, and against the Kriste'yans and Mo-
hammedans.
11.· And I made the beginning of the work
of these infidels and scholars to correspond
with the discovery of Guatama by Columbo,
and I kept them at their work for three hun-
dred years, which was up to the time of the
establishment of the republic of Guatama,
which I, thy God, provided to be untrammeled
by an established religion.
12. After my workmen, the scholars and
infidels, had thus undermined the old edifice,
behold, I sent laborers, under the name of
merchants and traders, to commence clearing
away the rubbish.
13. And, because of their desires in money-
getting, they considered not the religious edi-
fice of any people, and they provided comity
relations whithersoever they went.
14. :For a hundred years, these, my"laborers,
have been at their work, stripping off and
clearing away the prejudice of nations and
peoples against oue another.
15. And then, behold, I came with my
builders, and I prepared a new foundation,
broader and wider and firmer, for an edifice
adapted to all the nations and peoples in the
world.
16. First, I sent my miracle-workers forth
into every quarter, saying unto them: vVhatso-
ever was done by the ancient Gods and Saviors,
do ye eYen so, and grea.ter. For I· will show,
unto all the world, that no man nor God is
worthy to be worshipped because of miracles. II
17. And they went forth at my command,
and my angels went with them, doing wonders.
18. They healed the sick, by the laying on
of hands; they restored the blind to sight, and
made the deaf to hear, and have brought the
supposed dead to life. ·
19. They have caused writing to come on
stone tablets, and on paper, in the light of day,
by unseen hands.
20. They have caused ponderous bodies, with-
out mortal contact, to move, and to beat time
to music.
21. A child hath lifted eight full-grown men
with her little finger.
22. They have passed full-blown flowers and
plants through boards and tables, unbruised and
uninjured, and, yet, there was neither hole nor
opening in the boards and tables.
23. They have made stars of light that spake
with audible voices; they have made pillars of
fire by night, and pillars of cloud by day.
24. They have caused the spirits of the dead
to appear as if in flesh and blood; and, whilst
thus appearing, talking face to face with their
mortal kin, who saw them, heard them, and, by
the subject of the discourse, proved them to be
the very angels of heaven, returned to their
earth-kin a.nd friends.
25. For the time of one generation thy God
hath thus kept open the gates of heaven; work-
ing through mortals, by the angels of heaven.
26. My testimony and my witnesses are hun-
dreds of thousands. I hide not the work of
my hand and of my angels in a corner; I extend
them abroad over the earth; I manifest in the
cities and country places; I prove unto all
peoples, that common men and women can do
the miracles for which Gods and Saviors have
been worshipped.
27. Yea, I give these powers unto good and
bad men, and unto good and bad women.
28. For I show miracl\ls in order to break
down the worship of miracle-workers.
29. For I will have none worshipped but Je-
hovih. And I have inspired angels to this end,
and to the encl that good works and wisdom
shall be, henceforth, the means of resurrection
in heaven.
30. And I have shown also, that only by har-
mony . and the union of many, can any great
good come unto the generations of men.
CHAPTER :XXXVII.
GOD REVEALETH HIS METHOD OF WORK.
GOD said: Think not, 0 man, that thy God
goeth about a work without system and
order.
2. Verily, these are the first of my consider-
ations.
3. First, I send my loo'is, my masters of
generations, clown to the earth, to the nations
and peoples where I design to build my edifice.
4. And my loo'is, by inspiration, control the
marriages of certain mortals, that heirs may be
bom into the world suited to the work I have
on hand.
790
THE BOOK OF JUDGMENT. 39
5. For many generations, my loo'is labor to
this end, raising up thousands and tens of
thousands of mortal heirs according to my
commandments.
6. So, 0 man, since four hundred years my
loo'is shaped mortal · births to bring about the
armies of thy God.
7. And now, when the time of kosmon had
come, behold, I sent my Lords and my numer-
ators, to receive the harvest and the records of
my loo'is.
8. Thus, 0 man, thy God knew beforehand
what part and what place each and every one
of his mortal laborers was adapted to.
9. And through my Lords and generals and
captains of my angel hosts, I commanded them
to fall to work on my building.
10. Some to heal the sick, some to work
signs and miracles, some to lecture, some to
write, and so on, every one according to the
work of his adaptation.
11. And all of this is to one purpose ; not to
build up or exalt any man, nor God, nor relig-
ion, but to found J ehovih's kingdom on earth.
12. To give man the system of universal
peace, love, harmony and kosmon, adapted to
all nations and peoples in all the world.
13. And I commanded my Lords and angels,
generals and captains to this end ; and I,
furthermore, commanded certain angel regis-
trars to accompany and be with mortals in this,
the kosmon era, to observe them at the work
I provided them.
14. And whoso doeth a good work in truth,
righteousness, wisdom and love, my holy angels
are commanded to extend their sphere of use-
fulness and light.
15. I said unto my angels : Go ye with these
proofs before mortals, with signs and miracles ;
go to the rich and the poor, to the learned and
to the unlearned. And ye shall observe them, as
to what use they make of the new revelations.
16. For some shall appropriate these things
to money-making; some, to personal fame ;
some, to evil purposes; but a few, to the glory
of the Almighty, and the exaltation of mankind.
17. Try ye all mortals, and make a register
of them and their behavior, and preserve the
same in my heavens.
18. And it shall come to pass that many of
my seers shall have great poverty and great
hardships, for they will be unsuited to serve
mammon. Nevertheless, they shall convert
the rich, proving my truths unto them. And
my seers shall go to them in distress, and the
rich shall deny them, and refuse them.
19. Make a record of these also. For, in
course of time, and, because of the hardness of
their hearts, I shall withdraw my holy angels
away from such rich people, and they shall be
left to fall into the obsession of drujas.
20. And their families shall be obsessed,
their wives, or husbands, or sons, or daughters.
21. And the drujas shall divide the families,
turning a man against his father, and a daugh-
ter against a mother, and a daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law.
22. For, whoever goeth away from me, pay-
ing tribute to satan (self), I will not follow after.
23. And the drujas shall say: Think not we
are come to send peace on earth, we come not
to bring peace, but to bring a sword.
24. And families of the unrighteous, being
obsessed with drujas, shall keep secret their
convictions, and they shall say: ·This is lunacy,
meaning derangement.
25. Others, being asked, if they belong to
the new dispensation, shall say: Nay, we know
nothing of it; behold, we are good members of
the church!
26. And now, accordingly, all such matters
were recorded in my heavens, and such mortals
became known to me.
27. And such as consulteth the spirits in
regard to money-making, or to earthly matters
for self's sake, also became known to me.
28. And I commanded my holy angels to
withdraw from all mortals who were not work-
ing for Jehovih's new kingdom, who were of
no profit in the resurrection of man; and,
behold, this was also done.
29. And it came to pass, that many to whom
I had offered the exalted work, fell into the hands
of drujas. And they held conferences, and were
divided, man against man, and woman against
woman ; full of boasting and short-sighted wis-
dom, seeking the applause of the multitude.
30. And so my angels sifted them and sorted
them, in order to find such as were willing to
sacrifice self for the sake ofthe Father's kingdom.
31. These I drew aside, and I said unto
them : Ye, that choose to serve J ehovih,
behold, J ehovih hath chosen you also.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
GOD $HOWETH THE MIS1'AKES OF MAN'S JUDG-
MENT.
GOD said: I said unto thee, 0 man, pursue
thy wisdom after the manner of thy God.

much to convert adults, as to prepare the minds
of the young.
3. Now, behold, because I told thee this,
thou sought to have children born unto thee
after the manner of Gods.
4. Thou saidst : I understand the new king-
dom; I have the solution for raising up a new
generation on the earth. I have chosen me my
women, who also comprehend, and, behold, our
offspring will be very Gods !
5. But I admonished thee, saying : Thou
openest the door for adultery; thou shalt
surely go down.
6. Thou wouldst not profit by the wisdom
of ages. I had holden up my hand, and said :
One wife, one husband!
7. Now, hear me, 0 man : In a new cycle
man ever runneth to the extreme opposite of
the old errors, and thus bringeth upon himself
new ones, that he knew not of.
8. I say unto thee : The new edifice shall be
of all that was good of the past, of things
proven in heaven and on earth.
9. Also, I say unto thee, it shall be of the
young, and not of the adult.
10. Because thou hast attempted to beget off-
spring for the new kingdom, thou, of all men,
art the most unfit.
11. My laborers shall not have desire to be
either fathers or mothers. Nor shall they
seek in any way things that belong on the
earth ; nor have passions that belong only to
the earth.
12. Nevertheless, they shall be the founders
of the Father's kingdom on earth, and with the
young.
13. They shall gather up orphans and cast-
aways in infancy, and take them into colonies,
hundreds and thousands of them.
14. And these infants shall be fed and
clothed and raised np, not after any man's
whim or conceit, but according to the accu-
mulated wisdom collected from all the different
nations and peoples in all the world, as to how
to make the best corporeal and spiritual men
and women.
15. Behold, it hath · been proven in the
warrior . and pugilist how to raise a savage
man, by flesh diet and inharmonious surround-
ings; and in nations and tribes of peace, how
to raise a virtuous and industrious man, on
herbs and fruit diet.
16. These are things for thee to learn, 0
man, going at the subject systematically, to
find the best way to make the best man and
woman out of the infants entrusted to thee.
17. Not only as to diet, but as to clothing,
and as to comfort and cleanliness ; and to
avoid disease; and as to strength and supple-
ness and swiftness ; and as to virtue and
modesty ; and as to education, practical and
theoretical; and as to industry and quick per-
ception; and as to willingness to work for one
another; and to trades and occupations; and
as to pastimes, amusements and recreations,
singing, dancing and playing with great joy
and delight; and as to worship, to rites and
ceremonies; and as to acquiring seership and
prophecy and signs and miracles, in su'is
and sar'gis ; as to communing with angels,
and as to the value of angels as teachers and
instructors by tangible presence and audible
voices. ·
18. And yet, above all things, thou shalt
preserve liberty unto all, with pleasant and en-
joyable discipline for everything, after the
manner of my heavenly kingdoms.
19. Remembering, that every faculty in
every one shall be cultivated to the utmost.
20. Teaching them, from the first, that the
eye of J ehovih is upon them, and that His
hand is stretched over them, to bless them,
according to their goodness, purity, love, gentle-
ness and wisdom.
21. And that they shall not own nor possess
individually; but that all things are Jehovih's,
and they, themselves, are angels in mortal
form, created by J ehovih to rejoice and to
help one another forever.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
GOD PROVIDETH FOR INCREASE.
GOD said: When thy educational colony of
infants shall have grown up to manhood
and womanhood, they shall understand that,
as they were once homeless and fatherless, and
ye gathered them up, and provided unto them,
even so shall they go, and do likewise, gather·
ing up from the Uzians other orphans and
castaways, and raising them in other colonies,
after the same manner.
2. And it shall come to pass, that many will
desire to marry, and it shall be granted unto
them to choose amongst their own people, and
marry whorn they will.
3. But it shall be a law that no man nor
woman shall marry more than one time.
4. Whether the partner die, or whether they
divorce themselves, yet, to none other shall
either ever wed more.
. 792
THE BOOK OF .JUDGMENT. 41
5. Also it shall be a law, that, at maturity,
if any one desireth to leave the colony, he shall
do so without hindrance or prejudice.
6. Though it shall be inculcated into them,
during their youth, that, at maturity, they are
supposed to swarm out, after the fashion of
bees, becoming too numerous for one hive, and
go and form a new colony ; that in all things
they shall be taught not to do anything for
self's sake, but for the good of man and for the
honor and glory of J ehovih.
7. And these things shall come to pass with
these people :
8. They shall abjure war;
9. They shall be non-resistants ;
10. They shall have su'is, and shall see with-
out their mortal eyes, and hear without their
mortal ears.
11. My angels shall appear before them, and
walk with them, talking to them, and teaching
them of my kingdoms.
12. And angels of the I'hin race will come
to them; and of the I'huans, and of all other
peoples whereof mention is made in this
0AHSPE.
13. And mortals shall recover, from the
libraries in heaven, things that have been lost
on the earth, as to languages and histories of
tens of thousands of years ago.
14. And mortals shall prophesy truly of
things in heaven.and on the earth.
15. And many shall attain adeptism, and, in
spirit, go out of their mortal bodies, and appear
l Uz, 11 World's people.'~
hundreds of miles away, and there make them-
selves known ; and they will return again to
their mortal bodies, unharmed.
16. All these, and even greater things, shall
my angels teach them.
17. Flatter not thyself, 0 man, that these
things can come in Uz, or that they can come
suddenly. They can neither come to Uzians,
nor can they come suddenly.
18. It is not the work of thy God in this
cycle to raise up any man to become· worship-
ful because of such wonders; it is my work to .
show man how he shall attain to these things
himself.
19. For this reason, I come not, in this day,
to call sinners to repentance, nor to gather up
the lost sheep of Israel.
20. I come now to the wise and pure, who
have fulfilled the former commandments.
21. I come to give them a new lesson, which
is, to show them how to build the Father's
kingdom on earth.
22. I come to raise up a new people in the
world, greater than hath ever been.
23. Those that I sent have cleared away the
old edifice. I come not as a destroyer; I come
as a builder.
24. Into thy hands, 0 man, l give the key
to the heavenly kingdoms. Remember, the
password which admitteth thee to the all high-
est kingdoms is, JEHOVIH, THE I AM.
END OF THE BOOK OF JUDGMENT.
2 It is a remarkable coincidence, that as soon as the Brabn;mns Christians; a11 soon as they made an idol of Christ, signs and mtra.
began to preach Brahma, instead of Ormazd (tbe Crentor), they cles left them. The Roman catholics have frequently pretended to
Jost the signs and miracles of the ancients. The same thing came have the signs, but it is only a pretenCe. ·Manifestations, like those
to the Budhists, as soon as they began to preach Budha, the signs at Lourdes (even if true), are but the trick• and games of drujas,
and miracles left them. And the same thing happened to the as the results show.

BOOK OF INSPIRATION.
CHAPTER I.
THESE are the words of Tae, in kosmon :
I am Light ; I am Central, but Boundless,
saith J ehovih.
2. I give thee of My Light; and when thou
hast received, thou criest out: Behold, I am
wise!
3. Thy corpor I made, in which to localize
thee; to mature thy entity.
4. Without Me, thou hadst not come to life.
Thou art as the end of a ray of light from My
Person.
5. And thou art focalized in thy corporeal
body.
6. I am to thy spirit, as is the sun to a ray
of light. I am the Light that illuminateth
thy soul.
7. The ray of light that goeth out of Me,
taketh root in mortality, and thou art the
product, the tree.
8. Thou wert nothing ; though all things
that constitute thee, were before.
9. These I drove together, and quickened.
10. Thus I made thee.
11. After the manner I made thee cor-
poreally, so made I thee spiritually, intel-
lectually.
12. As out of corpor I made thy corporeal
body, so, out of My Light, which is My Very
Self, I built thee up in spirit, with conscious-
ness that thou art.
13. Thou canst not add one jot or tittle to
thy corporeal self, of thine own will and exer-
tion. ·
14. It is by and through Me, that the pro-
cess of absorption by the blood addeth unto
thee.
15. Thy blood floweth in thy veins because
· of My quickening power u pon thee.
16. When I withdraw My hand, thou diest.
Life and death are of Me.
. 17. All thy corporeal part is, therefore, of
Me and through Me.
18. Even so is thy spirit of Me also.
19. And as thou canst not add a fraction to
thy corporeal self, neither canst thou add a
fraction to thy spiritual self.
20. Out of Myself groweth thy spirit.
21. Neither canst thou, of thine own self,
manufacture or acquire or take unto thyself,
one new thought, nor idea, nor invention.
22. All thought and knowledge and judg-
ment which thou hast, I gave unto thee.
23. As the whirlwind gathereth up dust,
and driveth it toward a centre, so is the plan
of My universe.
24. Thou art as a centre ; all things come to
thee from without.
25. 'fhy knowledge, as well as thy corpore-
ality, came to thee from without, from that
which was external to thyself.
CHAPTER IL
THOU art of inspiration made, saith Jeho-
vih.
2. I made thee a corporeal body, and I wrote
upon it. The result thou art.
3. And I made thee susceptible, so all
things external to thyself could write upon
thee.
4. The sum of these is thy knowledge.
5. As it is with thee, so is it with all men,
and with all the living which I created.
6. Nor is there any knowledge in the world,
but what I gave.
7. All of it is My inspiration.
8. II Man said: By certain measurements, I
teach my son mathematics.II
9. I am back of all, saith J ehovih.
10. I taught thy father's father and all who
were before him. The sum of all of man's
knowledge is but man's capacity to perceive
My Light.
11. I made thee My servant, to t each thy
son by certain measurements. This was the
road I made to reach thy son's soul.
12. IIMan said : I know more than did my
794
BOOK OF IN SPIRA.. TI ON. 2
father; and yet my father knew more than did
his father. vVe reason, we digest, we com-
pound from one another. II
13. I am the All Extemal ; from Me are
smaller lights focalized, saith J ehovih.
14. A man holdeth a condensing lens to the
sun, and he lighteth a fire thereby, but yet the
lens contained not the heat.
15. After such manner hast thou accumu-
lated knowledge; yet, no knowledge was of
thine own begetting, but all came from Me. I
gave it all.
16. The increase in knowledge now upon the
earth, with all the races of men, is only the
increase I gave. Man of himself created none
of it.
17. Neither canst thou create one thought,
nor idea, nor impulse.
18. Thou canst only gather together from
My harvests, or from Me in Person.
CHAPTER III.
THE eye of man I made to obtain knowledge
by light; but the ear of man I made to
obtain knowledge from darkness, and within
darkness, saith J ehovih.
2. 'l'he power of touch I gave to man,
whereby he might learn of things their adapt-
ability and compatibility and incompatibility
with himself.
3. These are the corporeal doorways I gave
unto thee, 0 man, whereby thou mightest re-
ceive knowledge from Me and My creations,
consciously to thyself.
4. Through these, thou art constantly im-
pregnated ; through these, thy soul accumu-
lateth knowledge of My works. ·
5. \Vhatsoever is charged upon these door-
ways of thy soul, is inspiration.
6. When thou seest bread, thou art inspired
to eat; when thou seest a horse, thou art in-
spired to ride; when thou touchest a nettle,
thou art inspired with pain.
7. Yet, in all cases, thou must have practice
before thou canst comprehend the inspiration
that cometh to thee from these external things.
8. II Man saith: To-day, I remember my
friend whom I saw not for many a year.II
9. J ehovih saith: I made thee as a store-
house, and as a book that was written before.
10. And I gave to thee power to re-read thy
stores and thy book, within thy soul.
11. This was the accumulated inspiration
which I had previously given thee.
12. When thou art fevered, or entranced, or.
in diverse a.ctiou from thy usual bent, thy soul
turneth into these stores, and thy memory
cometh forth wonderfully.
13. This is the manifestation of inspiration
which I had previously given thee.
14. I made thee that thou shouldst receive
inspiration, not only from the world extemal
to thyself, but inspiration from the members
of thy body.
15. My impression upon thee is in3piration;
but thou must realize My inspiration, in order
to know Me.
16. An idiot holdeth fire in his hand, and it
giveth him pain, but yet, he knoweth not the
cause, nor whence the origin of the pain.
17. So, also, I come to thee, and give thee
inspiration, but thou discernest not Me.
18. Another man discerneth My Presence,
and My inspiration. He heareth Me speak;
he seeth My Person.
19. Yet, I am with both alike.
20. One man openeth his mouth to speak,
and, behold, My words come forth.
21. And yet another saith : No man knoweth
Jehovih; none have heard Him.
22. One man is sensitive, as a plate for a
picture, and he catcheth My Light instantly,
and knoweth it is from Me.
23. Another one saith: A sudden thought
struck me! But he discerneth not whence it
came.
CHAPTER IV.
W HEN the infant is young, My Light is
its first knowledge, saith J ehovih.
2. It seeth Me and heareth Me; and it seeth
and heareth My angels.
3. By the pressure of My Light upon its
corporeal eyes and ears, it learneth to see and
hear corporeally.
4. This is the beginning of two senses, which
I created to grow parallel to each other, and
equal in strength.
5. But the infant, being in the corporeal
world, heedeth more the things that appeal to
the corporeal senses than such as appeal to the
spiritual senses.
6. So that one person groweth up, forgetting
Me and My angels. He is a skeptic.
7. But another person groweth up, remem-
bering Me and My angels. He is a believer.
8. And, behold, thou, 0 man, inquirest of
them : Whence came the idea of a Creator, an
All Person?
795
3 OAHSPE.
9. And one of them answereth thee : It is
inherent; it is natural.
10. But the other answereth: It is folly; it
came from darkness.
11. But I say unto thee, 0 man: Darkness
cannot create an idea; not even darkness
would be known but for the light I make be-
side it.
12. Thou canst not imagine any animal
under the sun which I have not created.
13. II Man said : I imagine a horse with a
fish's head and fins. II
14. Whatsoever thou inventest, saith Jeho-
vih, thou but takest the parts of one of My
creations, and puttest them to another.
15. Let this prove unto thee, if thou canst
not invent a new living creature, that thy fore-
fathers did not do so either in regard to Me.
16. Nevertheless, thou hast a thought, and
an idea of Me and of My Person.
17. And thou hast a thought, and an idea of
the spirits of the dead.
18. By My Presence and inspiration upon
thee, I t aught thee I am the I AM, a Person.
19. By the inspiration and presence of My
angels, I taught thee of them also.
20. My inspiration upon the bird causeth it
to sing; by My Presence I teach it to build its
nest.
21. By My Presence I color one rose red,
and another white.
22. Proof of My Person is in the harmony
of the whole, and of every one being a person
of itself, perfect in its order.
CHAPTER V.
TWO kinds of voices have I, saith J ehovih:
The silent voice and the audible voice.
2. All men I created susceptible to one or
the other of My voices, and many to both.
3. One man heareth My voice in the breeze,
and in thunder, and in music.
4. Another heareth My voice in the flowers
of the field, and in the scenery of the moun-
tains.
5. And yet another feeleth My inspiration ;
and he skippeth up the mountain side, and tir-
eth not on the way.
6. He that neither seeth nor feeleth My
in~p.
\ation, goeth up the mountain in great
labor. ·
7. In proportion as man is clear in his cor-
poreality and in his spirit, so discerneth he
My inspiration.
8. And if he have great purity as well, then
he shapeth My Light into corporeal words.
9. These I taught man to call My revealed
words.
10. Nevertheless, no corporeal man created
I perfect ; neither can any man reveal My
words perfectly.
11. But I created the way open unto all
men, to try to reveal Me.
12. According to man's approximation to
perfect manhood, so reveal I unto him, by My
Presence and My words.
13. According to man's imperfection in man.
hood, so doth not My inspiration manifest on
his senses.
14. Perfect manhood creat ed I possible, in
equal corporeal and spiritual senses.
15. Strong corporeal senses and weak spirit-
ual senses detract man from My Presence, and
make him infidel to My Person.
16. Such a man denieth My inspiration and
the inspiration of My angels. He is little
more than a forest tree, which hath a trunk
and many branches, but moveth not from its
place.
CHAPTER VI.
I AM One Spirit, saith J ehovih.
2. My quickening power is upon all the
living; because of this, they live and move.
3. According to the different structure of
the living, so is My inspiration manifested by
them.
4. One, as the hare, runneth away in cow-
ardice; another, as a lion, is ferocious; another,
without judgment, as the serpent.
5. And as to man: One is inspired t o music;
another to mathematics ; another to seership,
and so on.
· 6. To all of these I am the One, the Univer-
sal Inspirer that moveth all of them.
7. According to their organic structure, so
do they manifest My inspiration.
8. The lowest of living creatures made I the
serpent, for I gave to him an element capable
of destroying himself.
9. When the earth was encircled with poi-
sonous gases, I creat ed poisonous vines and
weeds and trees and all kinds of herbs, rich-
growing upon the earth.
10. Thus, from destroying gases and from
earth-substance created I the vegetable world.
And, in that day, all growing things upon the
earth which I had created were poison as to
animal life.
796
BOOK OF INSPIRATION. 4
11. Then, I created the serpents ; of all
sizes created I them. And they were poison
also.
12. And the serpents I created were carniv-
orous, feeding upon one another. Self-impreg-
nating created I them.
13. Thus drove I the poison of the air down
into vegetation, and thence into the animal
world; thus I purified the air of heaven.
14. This was the first creation I created on
this world.
15. Then I overcast the earth with falling
nebulre, and covered up the poisons growing
upon the earth, and they were turned to oil and
coal.
16. Then, I made a new creation; giving feet
and legs and bones to the animals I designed
for the earth.
17. And when the earth was ripe for man,
then I created him ; male and female created I
those of the second creation.
18. And man was dumb, like other animals;
without speech and without understanding,
even less than any other creature which I had
created.
19. Nevertheless, I had given to man, and
thus made him, out of the dissolved elements
of every living thing that had preceded him.
20. And man partook of the first and the
second creations. After the manner of every
animal on the earth, so created I man; with all
the characteristics of all of them, so created I
him, male and female created I them.
21. And man was unconscious of his creation,
not knowing whence he came; nor knew he
which was his own species.
22. And I sent angels to man, to teach him
who he was, and to rouse him up to his capa-
bilities, for which I created him.
23. And my angels drew, from man's side,
substance, and thus took on corporeal forms;
and the angels dwelt with man as helpmates,
to make man understand.
CHAPTER .VII.
I CREATED man, even from the first, that
_ he should learn to be an independent being,
saith J ehovih.
2. And when My angels had taught man
speech, making man name all the animals in
the world, after the names the animals called
themselves, .I commanded My angels to come
animals I created in the world, to man only
gave I capacity to transmit knowledge to his
brethren by words.
4. And to man only gave I capacity to com-
prehend an idea of Me, his Creator.
5. Nevertheless, I inspire all living animals
whieh I created; but they know it not.
6. I inspire the spider to make its net ; the
bird to build her nest; the wild goose to fly to
the south, before the winter cometh; the mare
to neigh for her colt; the ant to lay in its
stores; the bees to dwell in a qneendom; and
so on, every living creature do I move and con-
trol by My inspiration upon them.
7. Males and females I inspire to come to-
gether at times and seasons; and then to live
apart during gestation. These I keep before
man as a lesson of the wisdom of My inspira-
tion.
8. To man I give liberty to acquire wisdom
by observing the method of My work, as I
manifest in other living creatures.
9. I have also given man capacity to attain
to know My inspiration in contradistinction
from the inspiration he receiveth from his sur-
roundings.
10. To no other creature gave I this capacity.
11. What cometh of Me, is without pain or
injury to any one, and with liberty unto all.
Such are My inspirations.
12. When man witnesseth a battle, he is in-
spired to battle; when he witnesseth peace and
love, he is inspired to peace and love.
13. What moveth man in consonance and
wisdom, and to life, is My inspiration.
14. What moveth man in dissonance and
folly, and to death, is inspiration from man's
surroundings.
15. I inspire the serpent to bite to death; for
thus created I it. This is no sin, for it fulfilleth
its labor; it is the remnant of poison of other
eras.
16. Man I created not to destruction, but to
life, wisdom, peace and love toward all.
17. When man practiceth virtue, wisdom,
truth and love unto all, his inspiration is from
Me direct.
18. \Vhen man practiceth destruction and
selfishness, his inspiration is indirectly from
Me, through the conflict of his surroundings.
19. And thus becometh he evil, instead of
good.
20. By direct inspiration do I move upon all
the animals I created.
away from man, for a season.
3. To My angels I said : Behold, of
21. This I also created possible unto men,
all the separate from indirect inspiration.
797
5 OAHSPE.
CHAPTER VIII.
A LTHOUGH all inspiration goeth from Me
..l1_ to all the living, directly, yet I also cre-
ated man susceptible to indirect inspiration
from all My creations.
2. Whatsoever receiveth from Me direct, is
in harmony with Me.
3. The,lily and the rose I created perfect in
their order; the female bird I inspire to build
her nest in season, perfect in her order.
4. Even so is it with all My created beings,
save man. All the rest err not, in the order I
made them ; and they all fulfill the glory for
which I made them.
5. But because I made man capacitated to
receive inspiration from all things, he mani- ·
festeth both, evil and good ; according to his
birth and surroundings, so is man good or ba,,d.
6. Nevertheless, I created man with capacity
to comprehend this also;. for, I designed him,
from the first, to work his way up to the God-
head, understanding all below him.
7. And I sent My angels to man, teaching
him how to distinguish the difference in the
inspirations upon him, that he might govern
himself accordingly.
8, And My angels said unto man : Become
thou one with thy Creator; these are His
direct inspirations:
9. II To love thy Creator above all else, and
thy neighbor as thyself.
10. 'fo give delights only, and not pain.
11. To kill not.
12. To do not violently against His creatures.
13. To be considerate of the liberty of all
the living.
14. To interdict not the happiness and hope
of others, only where thou canst return a tran-
scendent glory and hope in place thereof,
15. For these are direct inspirations from
thy Creator.
16. But these are thy evil inspirations, 0
man, these come from thy birth and surround-
ings, formerly called satan:
17. To kill.
18. To slander.
19. To punish.
20. To destroy Jehovih's created beings.
21. To strive for thyself, above another.
22. To gratify thy flesh at the expense of
purity or wisdom.
23. To be false to Jehovih.
24. To be false to thyself.
25. To speak falsely.
26. To covet another's.
27. To cohabit in the gestative period.
28. To engage in strife, or to aid and abet
conflicts, which are the fruit of carnivorous
food, transmitted in birth. I/
CHAPTER IX.
MAN I created with capacity to distin-
guish My direct from My indirect inspi-
rations, saith J ehovih.
2. And My angels gave him rules, whereby
he might make manifest the difference betwixt
the two.
3. Man has said: Behold, any man may say:
Thus saith J ehovih ! One killeth his neigh-
bor, saying: I was thus inspired of J ehovih.
Another practiceth all goodness, and his words
are wisdom and comprehension, and he saith:
I was inspired by J ehovih !
4. I say unto thee, 0 man: In this I also
gave thee liberty; therefore, judge thou, thy-
self, which came from Me, and which from his
surroundings (sataQ).
5. Thou shalt be thine own judge in all
things.
6. Behold, I sent My God to judge thee;
but thou shalt also judge the judgments of thy
God; and, afterward, thou shalt judge thyself
in the same way.
7. A perpetual judge created I thee, not only
to judge thyself and all the world beside, but
thou shalt judge Me, thy Creator.
8. I have given thee many sacred books, and
I said to thee :
9. Save thou judgest them, thou shalt be
caught in a snare; I charge thee, thou shalt
accept nothing from men, nor angels, nor Gods.
10. But thou shalt rely on thine own inspira-
tion from thy Creator.
11. Such is My word which I speak to thine
own soul.
12. What cometh to thee from a man is indi-
rect inspiration; what cometh from an angel
is indirect ; and what cometh from the Gods is
indirect.
13. No direct inspiration of Me can come to
thee from a book, nor a sermon, nor from any-
thing in all My creations, but only from Me,
thy Creator.
14. Though one man receive direct inspira-
tion from Me, and he write it in a book, yet,
when it cometh to thee, it is indirect inspira-
tion, and is not binding upon thee, only so far
as My direct inspiration upon thee moveth
thee to receive it.
798
r
BOOK OF INSPIRATION. 6
15. Yet, not all men created I with the same
clearness to perceive Me, ancl to frame My wis-
dom in words.
16. Few only will turn away from the inspira-
tion of the world, and come unto Me.
17. Many profess Me in words, but they do
not fultill My inspiration in practice.
18. My words come easily to the pure in
heart; and My wisdom showeth itself in the
frame of their speech.
19. For I give them words, even as I give to
the animal inspiration to do perfectly and wisely
the parts for which I Cl'eat_
ed them.
20. Behold, I show the dmnb spider how to

for Me, to give words of wisdom to a righteous
man?
21. Or to put him in the way of receiving
My revelations ?
22. Or to show him the harmony and glory

what a labor for My Gods and ministering
angels!
4. 'l'o show thee that no two men see alike
anything I created;
5. 'fo make thee cautious, that, because thou

6. To induce thee thus and thus, without
interfering with thy liberty; -
7. To make thee watchful, to learn by thine
own inspiration from Me;
8. To make thee skeptical to others' versions
of My words, and yet make thee try to discover
My words and My Person, of thine own self,
to see Me and hear Me.
9. Now, behold, in the olden times, only here
and there one, in all the world, could be made
to comprehend Me.
10. As thou mayest say to the beast in the
field, or to the clog, the most knowing of ani-
mals : J ehovih ! J ehovih !
11. And they will not hear thee understand-
ingly:
12. So was it with nearly all the world, in
the olden time.
13. To-clay, I have quickened many.
14. To-morrow, the whole of the people in
all the world shall know Me.
15. This is the progress I created possible
unto thee; this road shalt thou travel.
16. Thou hast blockaded the way against Me
on every side.
17. Thou hast put Me away, and said: Natu-
ral law! Moral law! Divine law! Instinct!
Reflection! Intuition! Second sight!
18. I say unto thee: I have abolished all
these things. _ I will have then:. no more, for-
ever!
19. I have no laws; I do by virtue of Mine
own Presence.
20. I am not far away; behold, I am with
thee. -
21. I gave no instinct to any creature under
the sun. By My Presence they do what they
do.
22. I give no tuition by intuition; I am the
Cause to all, and for all.
23. I am the most easily understood of all
things.
24. My Hand is ready to whomsoever will
reach forth unto Me.
25. My Voice is ready and clear to whomso-
ever will turn away from other things, and
away from philosophers and ambiguous words,
serving Me in good works.
26. My Light is present, and answereth unto
all who follow their all highest knowledge.
CHAPTER XI.

followers unto this, or that, saith J ehovih.
2. Neither go about preaching, saying: Thus
saith J ehovih !
3. Let all men hear Me in their own way.
4. No man shall follow another.
5. I will have no sect.
6. I will have no creed.
7. I am not exclusive; but I am with all My
living creatures.
8. To those who choose Me, practicing their
all highest light, I am a shield and fortification
against all darkne&s, and against all evil and _
contention.II
9. Thou shalt not establish Me by man's
laws, nor by the government of man, saith
Jehovih.
10. Nor establish by man's laws or govern-
ment any book or revelation, saying: Beholcl,
this is J ehovih's book.

11. To keep man from interfering with man,
this hath been great labor.
12. To teach man to comprehend liberty,
especially as to thought and as to knowledge,
this hath been a great labor.
13. For he falleth easily under the inspira-
tion of his surroundings, and falleth under the
teachings and persuasions of his brother.
14. Because he cometh from My hand into
the world in innocence, a helpless infant.
15. And his elder brothers take advantage of
his innocence, and teach him their own knowl-
edge, instead of directing him to Me.
16. And his elder brothers were in darkness
themselves, and their elder brothers before
them.
17. I said unto man: Be free! Learn to
know liberty ! Think for thyself! Study thy
Creator in all things, and in thyself in particu-
lar !
18. Turn thou away from thy elder brothers;
come thou to the All Highest Fountain.
19. Be not confounded with abstruse reason-
ings; cut all things short, Godlike; learn thou
of the Creator and His creations, there is noth-
ing more.

and wert planted by His Hand. Be thou free

what thou shalt eat and drink, and where thou
shalt dwell by day, and sleep by night.
9. For all things shall write upon thy soul
the character and kind whereof they are made.
10. If thou wilt be gentle, like a lamb, and
non-resistant and docile, so thou mayest obtain
great knowledge, feed thou upon herbs and
fruits and cereals.
11. And thy blood shall be pure and cool,
and charged with food for thy spirit, in peace
and love.
12. But if thou wilt be ferocious, like a car-
nivorous beast, then thou shalt feed upon flesh
and fish, and thy blood shall be hot, and thy
spirit shall be stirred with passion and anger
and contention and tattling and war and jeal-
ousy and love of vengeance.
13. For whatsoever thou chargest thy blood
with, shall be charged upon thy spirit.
14. Because thou canst not feed on fish nor
flesh but through destructionunto death, even so,
destruction unto death shall come upon thy soul.
15. From thine own blood shall thy spirit be
inspired, even according to what thy blood con-
taineth.
16. As through corpor thy corporeal part is
nurtured, so through the gaseous, atmospherean
part is thy spirit nurtured.

34. By My direct inspiration upon them shall
they learn to do all things perfect, in the order

and without the long labor of books, and with-
out showing, or explanations.

so, now, I command thee to take the earth and

earth into thy dominion also.

away the heat, and bring the cold; to drive
away the cold, and bring the beat, as thou wilt,

38. To accomplish which, thou shalt now,
first of all, adapt thyself to thy Creator, accord-

thy blood and flesh, and in thy soul.

CHAPTER XIII.
M AN saith : If I cannot add one jot or
tittle to my corporeal body, and it is all
built up by J ehovih, then, indeed, it is His.
2. Neither am I accountable whether it be
well made, or well preserved.
3. And if I cannot make one new thought
nor idea, then are all my thoughts and ideas
Jehovih's, given by Jehovih, or by His crea-
tions.
4. Neither, then, am I accountable for my
thoughts, nor behavior, whether they be good
or bad. Verily, then I am not responsible for
anything, neither what I am, nor what I do,
nor for what becometh of me. I am but an
automaton; I, myself, am nothing.
5. J ehovih saith: Because I gave thee lib-
erty, thou art responsible for all thou art, and
for all thou makest thyself, and for all that
shall come to thee, and for thy peace and hap-
piness, both in this world and the next.
6. Liberty I gave thee as to what thou
shouldst eat, and shouldst wear to cover thy-
self, and where thou shouldst abide.
7. I gave thee liberty to build thy house in
thine own way; but, behold, such -liberty I
gave not to the bird, as to her nest, nor to the
beaver, nor to the ant, nor to any other living
creature.
8. Liberty I gave thee as to whether thou
should eat herbs or flesh. But such liberty I
gave not to any other living creature.
9. To the sheep and the horse I said : Eat
ye of herbs ; to the tiger and lion : Eat ye of
flesh.
10. To thee I gave liberty to make thyself
carnivorous, or herbivorous, or omnivorous.
11. Whatsoever thou didst put iu thy mouth,
and it united with thy blood, and entered thy
body, behold, it was by My labor and by My
power it was accomplished.
12. Verily was I thy workman.
13. All that thou didst in the matter was to
choose. Thou wert, in that respect, the mas-
ter, and I thy servant. And, behold, I made
not the servant responsible for the master's
behavior.
14. Because thou madest thyself carnivorous,
the fault is thine own. I placed before thee
the herbivorous animals and the carnivorous
animals; and I gave thee eyes to look upon
them as to their behavior, whether ferocious
and destructive, or peaceful, patient and doc-
ile.
15. And I spake unto thy soul, saying:
Look, judge for thyself as to what thou shalt
eat ; behold the order of My creations and the
result upon the living.
16. Hence, thou art accountable unto thy-
self, and responsible unto all the world for
having made thy corporeal body as thou hast.
17. I give thee liberty to receive thy in-
801
9 OAHSPE.
spiration from drunkards and harlots and
fighter,;; or from men of wisdom, or the inuo-
ceuce of childhood, or the virtue of a virgin.
18. Even so, in regard to thy spirit, thy
soul, thy mind, thy ideas and thy thoughts, I
gave thee liberty in the same way.
19. To behold a city of corruption, or the
country, with pnre air and trees, and flowers
and mountains and valleys.
20. And I spake unto thy soul, saying:
Choose thou what thou wilt to be the inspira-
tion of thy mind and spirit and soul; behold,
I, thy Creator, am thy servant to impregnate
thee with thoughts and ideas. All thou hast
to do, is to choose.
21. Yea, I said: I will even take thee to which-
ever place and condition thou mayest choose. II
22. And, now, because I gave thee this ex-
treme liberty, and thou hast chosen, behold,
thou art accountable to thyself for thine every
thought and idea; and for thy spirit and soul,
and in thy behavior to all the world.
23. With liberty I bestowed responsibility
also.
24. I am the Power, the Light and the Life.
25. In one thing, thou art not responsible
nor an automaton, and that is thine own en-
tity, thine own self, thine own I Am.
26. Thyself I gave to thyself, and even at
the ze1·0 of tby entity, I said: Go thou, make
thyself. All other animals I created perfectly
with Mine own hands, but to thee I gave
liberty to make thyself, even as thou hast.
Yea, even in this, I said : Choose thou, and I
will do the labor Myself for thee.
27. So that, choice and liberty were the sum
total which I gave to thee.
28. Now, therefore, 0 man, as I gave choice
and liberty unto thee, so shalt thou give the
same unto thy neighbor and associate.
29. ·without these, there is no responsibility;
with these, all responsibility.
30. Choose thou thine own food, and raiment
and thine house ; and choose thou the place,
and provide the way for whatever inspiration
thou mayest, still thou shalt be responsible in
all; whether the result be good or evil accord-
ing to thy choice, whether thou fawn upon
satan, or emulate thy Creator.
CHAPTER XIV.
2. The shortest day on the northern line of
the sun shall be the end of the year, and shall
be called old year's clay, saith J ehovih.
3. And the first day .thereafter, when the
sun on his southern course starteth towards
the north, shall be the beginning of the year,
and shall be called new year's clay.
4. These are My times of the end and the
beginning of a year, which I created; and I
made the earth and the sun as My written
testimony thereof.
5. And I blessed and sanctified the old
year's clay and the new year's clay, and I ap-
pointed them to be holy clays, that men might
rememb.er the order and the system of My
works.
6. And I said unto man : From one new
year's day until the succeeding one shall be
called one year, for it is one completed oscil-
lation of the earth, and of her revolution in the
orbit where I placed her.
7. Therefore, what thou hast completed
within a year shall be remembered by thee,
that thou mayest judge thyself therein.
8. And, on the old year's clay, thou shalt
render up in full forgiveness in all things
against all people.
9. And with the setting of the sun on that
clay, thou shalt be purged of all animosity and
claims against. every man, woman and child, in
all the world.
10. And thou shalt make acknowledgment
of this in words and songs and prayers, and
in tokens, of no intrinsic value, to whomso-
ever thou shalt have offended during the past
year.
11. Tae said: For which reason the old
year's day shall be named, the Most Holy
Sabbath Day. Behold, it is in accord with
His heavenly kingdoms. And it shall be with
thee a day of spiritual communion, and of
praise to J ehovih and His creations ; with
music and oratory, and ceremonies, and pro-
cessions for thy youth, orderly and well dis-
ciplined.
12. And, on the new year's clay, thou shalt
rejoice and sing and dance; mingling together,
old and young, even as the old year and the
new· year are joined together, side by side.
13. The seventh clay of the new year shall
be thy next sabbath day, and it shall be a day
of rest and of spiritual communion and praise
to J ehovih and His creations, with singing and
oratory.
THESE are Tae's revelations of J ehovih's
times and seasons, appointed unto the
chosen:
14. So also shall every seventh day be a
sabbath day ; for which reason seven days
802
BOOK OF INSPIRATION. 10
shall be one week, being six days for labor,
and one for rest and worship.
15. For this hath been .proven in all the
world to be good for man.
lG. These, then, shall be the moon's days
(months):
17. The fin;t new moon's day after new year's
day shall be the beginning of the first month;
and the completion of the fourth quarter of the
moon shall be the completion of the first month,
and it shall be named First month.
18. The next four quarters of the moon shall
be the second month, and it shall be named
Second month.
19. And the next completed four quarters of
the moon shall be named Third month. And
so on, to the completion of the year.
20. Such, then, shall be the months in any
and every year, for these are the moon's times
as J ehovih created them.
21. Neither shall it matter or not whether
the months overlap a new year's day; as they
are created and moved by the Almighty, even
so shall man compute and register them.
22. (II For example, a new year's day may
come upon the twentieth day of the Twelfth
moon or on another moon's day, still, as they
fall, so shall they be numbered in tmth.11)
23. As the moon's time differeth to different
continents, so shall the months' times of the
inhabitants of different continents be locally
unto them. ·
24. But, in the intercourse.between different
nations on different continents, the month times
shall not be enumerated.
25. But, in all such cases, the year and the
days thereof shall be named.
26. (II As, for example, the seventieth year
and the ninety-sixth day. II)
27. And it shall come to pass that the sab-
bath days all around the world shall be the
same day unto all people, even with the travel
of the sun.
28. ·whereby, Jehovih's heavenly kingdoms·
shall be in concert with mortals, as to times
and seasons in all things.

ber of the lodge) OF A PIECE OF PAPEI~, signi-
fying, CONSTITUTION.
5. Therefore it was said : The master saluted
on the sign, DAY OF THE HOLY SEAL, and the

31, 1848.)
4. And Jehovih said : Remember this day,
and keep it holy, to the end of the world. For,
without books and without arguments, behold,

CHAPTER XVII.
FREEDOM'S DAY.
A S Jehovih, through His God, delivered
into freedom Guatama's slaves, and, thus,
to geneni.l slavery dealt the final blow, so Je-
hovih blessed that day, and sanctified it.
2. Jehovih said: Remember the day of proc-
lamation of freedom, for it is My day, which
I bequeath unto you as a day of freedom in all
righteous jollification, which ye shall keep
every year, and commemorate, to the end of
the world.2
CHAPTER XVIII.
As Jehovih, through His God, bequeathed HOLY KOSl\iON DAY.

another matter, which J ehovih commanded to
be secret with the Faithists for a certain period
of time, the which time hath not expired to
this clay. Therefore, the clay of kosmon is still
a secret with the Faithists.
2. And J ehovih said : That mortals and
angels may live and labor in concert, behold,
I have given certain days, wher"
eby large con-
gregations on earth may be met by My organic
heavens, in reunion, mortals and angels, for
the happiness of both, and for the glory of My
works.
3. Now, behold also, as by My Presence I
inspire thee, when thou laborest with Me, and
thou art doing righteously, and with purity
and love, so also is it with thee, in regard to
My angels.
4. When thou makest and keepest thy cor-
poreal body pure and clean, My angels, who
are pure and clean, come to thee to aid thee,
and to enlighten thee.
5. And when thou puttest away all unclean
thoughts and all selfish desires, and seekest to
obtain wis9.orn, and to learn how best thou
canst help thy fellow-man, behold, My angels
of light and wisdom come to thee, and, by
virtue of their presence,.which thou seest not,
they inspire thy soul in the light of thy Cre-
ator.
6. Man hath said : I will not be a seer, nor
a prophet, nor a su'is, nor sar'gis; verily, I
will not have angels with me to teach me, or
to give me any light or knowledge under the
sun.
7. Whatever I can attain, it shall be mine
own. Wiser is it for me to attain to know,
and to do things of myself, than have angels
come and give to me, or manifest through me.
8. Verily, I will not be used, by man nor
angel, for it would be prostituting my flesh and
my spirit to others.
9. Behold, my body was given to me for
mine own use and profit, to establish and
develop mine own soul unto eternal happiness
in individuality. II
10. Alike unto all people is My Presence,
saith J ehovih. I am unto the just and the
unjust; I am everywhere, both, in darkness
and in light.
1 And Jehovih gave the sign, .A. HAND HOLDING ASIDE A VEIL,
eignifying, HEAVEN UNVEILED, as the master's sign iu the lodge on
the day and evening commemorating the same. And He gave to
the members of the lodge to answer in the sign, 'l,HREE CLAP-
PINGs, signifying, ENDLESS Joy!
11. Because thou art in darkness, thou be-
holdest not Me..
12. Because thou art imperfect in flesh and
spirit, thou deniest Me.
13. Because thou art confounded with inhar-
mony, thou believest not in Me.
14. He, who hath not an ear for music, dis-
covereth not a tune ; even as he that is dis-
cordant denieth My Person.
15. To the pure there is no selfishness,
neither for earthly things, nor for their own
flesh and spirit.
16. A pure man is as a clear glass ; he can
see out of himself, and; so, perceive My angels
and Me.
17. Through the pure man, pure angels can
see mortality as well as spirituality. Their
presence inspireth him to understand all things.
18. As much with the man that is not a seer,
or a su'is, are the angels, as with those that
are seers, or su'is, or sar'gis.
19. Because thou seest not, nor hearest an-
gels, only proveth thy darkness, but proveth
not the absence of angels.
20. 'fo the dark, come the dark; with the
dark, abide the dark, both, angels and mortals.
21. More is the man of darkness ruled by
angels, than is the man of light.
22. Behold, I created thee not to fill any
place in all the world for thine own self's sake.
23. Neither gave I thy flesh nor thy spirit
to be thine only.
24. These, also, shalt thou relinquish, say-
ing: To Thee, 0 Jehovih, I give all; my flesh,
my spirit, my mind, and all my service, to be
Thine forever.
25. Thou shalt say: Appropriate Thou me,
soul and body, in whatsoever way Thou canst,
that I may do the most good unto others, mor-
tals and angels. JI
26. Until thou attainest this, thou shalt not
hear My Voice, nor see My Hand.
27. As I gave away Myself, and thus created
·an things, so shalt thou follow in My foot-
steps, in order to become one with Me.
28. Herein lieth the secret of wisdom, truth,
love and power, time without end.

BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH,
WHICH CONTAINETH WITHIN IT
THE BOOK OF SHALA~
ALL OF WHICH IS ANTE-SCRIPT.I
CHAPTER I.
I N the early days of the kosmon era, after
the revelations of the Father's kingdom on
earth had been published, and was known
abroad over all the world, there went forth
many, in Jehovih's name, to accomplish unto
the resurrection of man, and for the glory of
the Almighty, the new kingdom.
2. Foremost, amongst the many, there came
out of Uz 2
one who was esteemed wise and
good above all others; and because he was a
representative man, the people named him,
Tae.
3. And Tae prayed unto Jehovih for light
and knowledge as to how best he could accom-
plish good unto the resurrection of the race of
man.
4. And J ehovih answered Tae, saying: Go,
bring My people out of Uz, and found them in
a place by themselves; for now is the begin-
ning of the founding of My kingdom on earth.
5. Tae answered, saying: Behold, 0 J eho-
vih, I have gathered together many men and
many women, and they all profess a desire to
found Thy kingdom.
6. One desireth to be a teacher ; another, to
be a superintendent; another, an overseer;
another, an adviser.
7. And they are all learned and wise and
good in their own way ; but, alas, they are
neither workers nor capitalists, the two chief
of all that I require.
8. Now, I pray Thee, 0 Father, what shall
thy servant do ?
9. J ehovih answered Tae, saying: Go, seek,
and bring out of Uz orphan babes and castaway
infants and foundlings.
10. And these shall be thy colony, which
shall be My new kingdom on earth.
11. Tae inquired: What can a man do with
babes ? How shall I feed them ? Moreover I
have not money to hire nurses.
12. Jehovih said: Have faith in thy Cre-
ator; in a good work done unto My little ones,
behold, I will provide.
13. Whatsoever thou dost unto them, even
so dost thou unto Me, wherein thou shalt not
fail.
14. Neither shalt thou strive to teach any
adult man or woman who is without faith in
Me. Behold, My people are infants in this era.
15. Deal thou with them, and with such
only as are willing to serve them ; for as much
as they are served, even so am I served also.
CHAPTER II.
-
so,Tae gathered together orphan babes and
castaway infants and foundlings, a great
number.
2. And a woman named Es,3 heard of Tae
and his work, and she came to him, inquiring:
3. How can a man attend babes ? Now,
because I have heard of thy work, behold, I
have come to thee to labor for our Father in
heaven.
4. 'rae said : ·whoso would labor for our
Father in heaven, let her do unto these little
ones.
5. Es said : Even for that I am before thee ;
I beseech thee, put me to work.
6. Tae inquired : Knowest thou the care of
infants ? And she answered him, saying:
7. In such labor, alas, I have had no ex-
perience, but I know J ehovih will guide me
aright; otherwise, He had not inspired my
soul unto the work. All wisdom is possible
through J ehovih.
805
2 OAHSPE.
8. Tae said : Such being thy faith, thou art
the first chosen woman in the Father's new
kingdom. Go, therefore, and fulfill thy part,
and may the Father be with thee.
9. So, Es went to work, accomplishing what
was required unto the infants.
10. And Tae went again unto Uz, and
brought hence more infants; many more than
were possible unto the care of one woman.
11. So Tae issued a call, to wit:
12. Wanted, fifty men and women, who are
Faithists in Jehovih, and are willing to take
part in founding the Father's kingdom on earth
as it is in heaven!
13. And there came, in answer to Tae's call,
thousands and thousands of men and women.
14. And Tae cried out: 0 J ehovih, what
shall Thy servant do? Behold, I asked for
fifty men and women, and here are come thou-
samls and thousands.
15. Jehovih answered Tae, saying : Try
them My Son, and see if they be worthy. As
many as are prepared, thou shalt accept; as
many as are not prepared, thou shalt not ac-
cept. Behold, there is room for millions !
16. And Tae spake unto the multitude,
saying: I called for fifty men and women, and,
lo, here are thousands, willing to take part in
founding the Father's kingdom on earth.
17. Now, behold, when I saw your great
number, I cried out: 0 Jehovih, what shall
'L'hy servant do? I did ask for but fifty, and
there are come here thousands and thousands.
18. And J ehovih answered, saying : Try
them, My Son ; as many as are prepared, ac-
cept ; as many as are not prepared, accept not.
Behold, there is room for millions.
19. Now, therefore, how say ye: What is
the founding of the Father's ·kingdom ? Who
here knoweth the way, and how to take part
therein?
CHAPTER III.
I T came to pass that many of the multitude
answered Tae; and of all that thus spake,
the following were the chief words, to wit :
2. Suttn. said: To do what I am willing to
do, is to take part in founding the Father's
kingdom ; therefore, hear me :
3. To adjust capital and labor, that each
shall contribute to the advantage and glory of
both.
4. That the capitalist shall receive good
profit on his capital; and the laborer high and
uniform wages.
5. To adjust them that they can live side by
side, equally, and neither above nor under the
other.
6. That they ma,y have extensive domains
and beautiful parks; excellent factories ; virtu-
ous and industrious people. .
7. The part that I am capacitated to fill in
this great work, is to reveal the key and the
pln.ns ; to explain all things to both, the capi-
talists and laborers.II
8. After that manner, Sutta went on at
great length, and he was followed by several
others, who had similar plans, but each one
doubted the other's capacity, as being qualified
for the work.
9. Abom spake next. He said: I have heard
Sutta's project. It is a farce. Capital and
labor cannot.harmonize.
10. And even if they could, it would be a
worldly basis. It would not be the Father's
kingdom.
11. In His kingdom there shall be neither
buying nor selling; neither servant nor master.
12. Now, behold, I say to you all, men and
women, as such, cannot harmonize together.
They are <liverse in all their ideas and general
knowledge.
13. The only way to accomplish the Father's
kingdom is through infants, to raise them up
in the way they should go.
14. But, even with these, failure will result,
save their pre-natal condition is provided for.
15. 'fherefore, the part I am capacitated to
accomplish is, to become father to innumera-
ble offspring, by most exalted and enlightened
women.
16. Also, I have great knowledge of physi-
ology, mentology and psychology, and I would
be willing .to be examiner and dictator as to
prospective parents.II
17. Thus spake .Aborn at great length; and
others spake in like manner, but each one pre-
ferred himself as the prospective father of the
offspring.
18. Next spake Thurtis. She said : This it
is, to found the Father's kingdom on earth;
hear me, that ye may understand.
19. Behold, all things shall be possible
through woman, especially as to raising up a
new generation on the earth.
20. During the period of gestation, man
should not approach woman.
21. Nay, in that period, woman should be
treated as a very Goddess.
22. Her every want and whim and notion
shonld be gratified to the utmost.
806
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 3
23. When she spake, or raised her finger,.
during the gestative period, every man and
woman and child should run to do her service.
24. And she should be surrounded by cul-
tured and exalted companions, and charmed .
with sweet music and delightful entertain-
ments.
25. Yea, as a very Goddess should all men
do her reverence.
26. "When such a woman hath a child born,
behold, there will be one child for the Father's
kingdom.
27. Now, behold, give me the choice as to
who shall father my children, and such a part
shall be my part, to help found the Father's
kingdom.
28. After Thurtis, then spake many of the
women after the same manner, and each one
doubted the other's capacity to fill the place,
but recommended herself!
29. Amos spake next. He said: I have
heard all these beautiful systems; I am ready
for any of them. Behold, I am a landscape
gardener.
30. The part I can do is to lay out the
grounds ; for plots of flowers and grass and
ornamental trees.
31. But ye shall provide laborers for me.
I work not with mine own hands; I plan and
design ; my capacity is in my talent and in my
education. II
32. After Amo::i, then spake five hundred
physicians, each one offering himself, to be
the physician for the Father's kingdom. Then
spake an equal numbet of lawyers in the same
way.
33. Next spake a thousand teachers of the
piano, each one offering to teach the young for
the Father's kingdom.
34. And now, with slow and solemn aspect,
rose up and spake five hundred priests of
Brahma.
35. They said: We have heard; we have
men. Behold, the Father's kingdom is none
of these.
36. It is the second coming of Brahma. He
shall come in flames of fire, from the east and
west and north and south. .
37. By the magic touch of his wand, the dif-
ferent castes of men shall be sorted; and the
dead shall come forth from their graves, ancl
Brahma shall judge them.
38. The sky shall be filled with holy angels,
the spirits of the saints, with wings of fire and
with tails a mile in length.
39. And the elect of the earth shall rise in
glory, and be immersed in Nirvana forever,
even at the feet of Ormazd.
40. This it is, to found the Father's king-
dom on earth. After which, all flesh shall
come into life free from sin; the corruptible
shall turn incorruptible forever.
41. Now, behold, our part, in founding His
kingdom, is to preach unto yon Brahma's ever-
lasting gospels. II .
42. Next to speak, were five hundred Bud-
bist priests. They said :
43. We have beard and seen also. Our learn-
ing, no man may gainsay. As for Brahma and
his .second coming, for that matter, he never
came once.
44. None have seen him, nor found his
dwelling-place. Therefore, he is but a super-
stition, a relic of the dark ages.
45. Hear us, then, as to the founding of the
Father's kingdom on earth:
46. It is the second coming of Budba, when
every knee shall bow down, and own him Lord
of all the world.
47. Behold, Bndha shall come with two
swords and twelve spears, and be shall have
ten thousand brides !
48. When Budha shall blow his breath upon
the earth, the graves shall oe opened, and the
dead shall come forth, and speak.
49. And Budha shall judge them; according
to caste, so will he separate them.
50. And ten hundred times ten thousand
million angels, with fiery wings and with tails
two miles in length, shall overspread the earth.
51. And all flesh shall become incorruptible;
the lion shall eat straw, and the lamb shall re-
joice in its kin without fear. II
52. Next spake five hundred Kriste'yan
priests. They said :
53. What profanity we have heard ! Be-
hold, as for Brahma and Budha, they are but
myths. It is the second coming of Kriste,
which is the founding of the Father's king-
dom.
54. Kriste said: Think not I came to send
peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but
a sword.5
55. It is he that shall subdue all the world,
and make men bow down, and own him Lord
of all.
56. He shall come in a sea of fire, with mill-
ions of archangels. And when his servant,
Gabriel, bloweth his horn upon the earth, the
graves shall open, and the dead shall come
forth, and speak to the living.
57. And he . shall judge them; separating
807
4 OAHSPE.
them, the bad to everlasting torments, and the
good, who have worshipped him, shall rise and
inherit everlasting bliss.
58. Now, behold, the part we can do in
founding the Father's kingdom, is to preach and
explain the beautiful doctrines of our blessed
Lord.II
59. ·when many others had thus spoken, Tae
said unto them: I called for such as had faith
in J ehovih. I am not in the labor of founding
a kingdom for Brahma, nor Budha, nor Kriste,
nor for any one but the Creator, our heavenly
Father.
60. As for the graves opening, I have noth-
ing to do with that; though, for the spirits of
the dead appearing face to face with the living,
behold, that hath been accomplished now for
more than thirty years, to hundreds of thou-
sands of good people. So with that I have
nothing to do either.
61. But since ye have not proved the com-
munion of angels during all these years, how
hope ye to labor for the Father's kingdom ?
To all such I say, go your ways; I have no use
for you.
62. At once, one-half of the multitude rose
up, and departed, mocking, saying: The spirits
of the dead! We will have none such, but
angels with wings, and with fleecy tails a mile
in length.
63. Tae inquired once more : Who, here, hath
faith in J ehovih, and, if we labor together in
His name, living our all highest light, that His
kingdom will be founded ?
64. Hundreds and hundreds said : It depends
on having plenty of money and a good planta-
tion. ·with money, it can be accomplished ;
without money, it cannot be.
65. Tae said · Your faith being in money, I
have no use for you. I called for those with
faith in J ehovih ! Therefore, go your ways also.
So, many more of the multitude departed, re-
turning to Uz also, even as harl the others.
66. Tae asked again : Who here are capable
and desirous of being leaders, let them speak?
67. More than a thousand cried out : Here !
That is my part. I am suited to it by nature
and by experience and by great wisdom.
68. Tae said unto them: Behold the spirit of
the age in which we live ! No man desireth a
leader or dictator over him. For that reason,
go your ways also; I have no use for you.
70. And, behold, another thousand cried out:
That is my strength. I can explain all sub·
jects; of diet, clothing, social intercourse, health,
marriage and worship !
71. Others cried out: I am a trance speaker;
I have angel guides two thousand years
old!
72. Others said : I am inspirational ; the
ancient prophets are my spirit guides! St.
John, the revelator ! Confucius ! Hosea!
King Solomon ! Daniel !
73. Tae interrupted them, saying: Behold,
the signs of the times show us that, as to
founding the Father's kingdom by words, ser-
mons and lectures, they are worthless.
74. See here ; I have gathered together hun-
dreds of helpless orphan babes. They care for
none of the things that have been offered ; they
neecl washing and feeding, and their clothes are
to wash and mend.
75. Who, so believing in the Father, that he
will give up self, in all respects, and work for
these little ones, having faith that J ehovih
will provide justly aud sufficiently unto all, let
him come.
76. You all do know how the farmers go
about gathering up calves and colts and the
young of all sorts ; and they take them to a
good place and feed them; and when they are
grown up, they are the choice in market.
77. Now, behold, there are thousands of
fatherless and destitute children in Uz, which,
left to themselves, either die or grow up to be
thieves, robbers and murderers.
78. These are cheaper than calves and young
colts. And they may be raised to be of more
profit to themselves and to the state, than ten
times as many cattle.
79. Who, then, is ready to join in this labor,
without money and without price, devoting his
life to training them up to prnctical knowledge,
not only of books, but to use their hands in
trades and factories, that these little ones may
become useful citizens, and a joy to themselves
and glory to the Father. Let such speak.
80. And, now, behold, fifty men and women
spake, saying: Take us, in J ehovih's name.
We have neither whim nor conceit to carry
out.
· 81. We are willing and anxious to go w this
labor, and we know J ehovih will provide unto
us. From clay to day His Light will shine
upon us, and we shall know what to do.
69. Tae asked again : Who here have made
a study of this subject, and are prepared to be
lecturers and teachers and advisers, let them
speak?
82. Thy children shall be our children; thy
hardships our hardships. We come not for
rest, nor glory, nor for comforts; but we come
808
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 5
to serve J ehovih in whatsoever He may give
us to do for His kingdom.
83. Tae said : In J ehovih's name, I accept
you. Whatsoever is mine shall be yours also. II
84. Thus it came to pass, out of all the thou-
sands and thousands who came, only filty were
accepted.
85. And the others went their way, mock-
ing, saying: A most beautiful Father's king-
dom on earth !
CHAPTER IV.
HISTORY OF SHALAM, FORMEl{LY CALLED "BOOK
OF SHALAM."
THE Voice of J ehovih came to Tae, saying:
Take thy people and go whither I will
lead thee, and ye all shall be blessed. Quite
sufficient are these, to begin the founding of
My kingdom on earth.
2. And Tae and his people went away to an
unoccupied country, by the river Shalam, so-
called because Tae had said :
3. I take the babes the Uzians would not
have, and I come to a place where the Uzians
would not live, and yet I will make it a place
of peace and plenty; therefore it shall be called
Shalam.
4, And when they had pitched their tents
and fed the children, Tae called them together
that he might speak before them.
5. Tae said : By and through J ehovih, are
all things accomplished, either directly or in-
directly.
6. If directly, by His inspiration, then are
all things well done, and in peace amd right-
eousness and love and wisdom.
7. If -indirectly, and through other inspira-
tion, then, indeed, is man answered in disaster
and unhappiness.
8. Foremost of all, must it be man's aim to
receive light directly from J ehovih in regard
to all things.
9. To do which, man must approach his
Creator, in words and conduct, doing in prac-
tice the right which be perceiveth in judgment.
10. Now, therefore, from our youth up we
have repeated the prayer: Thy kingdom come
on earth as it is in heaven.
11. Yet, not one of .us put forth a hand to
accomplish what we prayed for.
12. In which our prayers profaned the Al-
mighty.
13. For had we been true in heart, we had
taken hold in practice, according to our best
ability.
14. In not doing which, we were false before
J ebovih, and He could not answer our prayers
in truth.
15. Moreover, we had said to one another
from our youth up: As ye would that others
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.
16. Nevertheless, we served ourselves only.
17. We visited not the fatherless and mother-
less.
18. 1lve sold not what we might, and gave to
the poor.
19. vVe professed faith in Jehovih, but we
manifested faith in money and in soldiers and
warfare.
20. We bad said: Love the Creator with all
thy soul and heart and mind, and thy neighbor
as thyself.
21. Neither of which we fulfilled.
22. Now, therefore, we were unrighteous
toward man, and false before J ehovih.
.23. In repentance and shame have we come
out of Uz ; because we could not fulfill the
commandments whilst dwelling in Uz. Behold,
we have come thence, to begin a new life upon
the earth.
24. That our labor and our lives may be
given lmto J ehovih, with profit for the raiising
up of the race of man, and for the glory of the
Almighty, let us covenant ourselves unto Him
in fullness of heart and of soul and with all
our mind, to practice all the commandments in
fullness. What say ye ?
25. The multitude answered with one voice:
We desire to covenant with Jehovih, that our
labor and our growth may contribute to the
founding of His kingdom on earth.
26. Make thou, therefore, thy covenant with
the Creator, and, that we may be in unison,
behold, we will repeat with thee thy words,
that J ehovih may be glorified therein.
27. Tae said : Hear :me, then, ere ·we make
the covenant to J ehovih : In the heavens, the
angels surround the heavenly throne with col-
umns of fire and water; and all the space within
the circuit is named, the PLACE OF THE HoLY
CovENANT, and it is appropriated to worship
and to sacred rites and ceremonies.
28. But places of amusement and of all other
kind of entertainments, not sacred in rites and
ceremonies, are situated external to the Place
of the Holy Covenant.
29. Now, therefore, in remembrance of Je-
hovih's heavenly kingdoms, let ns mark a cir-
cular line around about this place, ancl march
in procession dedicating the enclosure to the
Holy Covenant.
809
6 OAHSPE.
30. The multitude said: This is wise; by
system and order and a place for all things,
harmony will answer unto us. Lead thou,
therefore, the way, and we will march with thee.
31. Then Tae marched, DRAWING T1rn LINE
01' THE SACRED CIRCLE, and the multitude, two
abreast, marched after him.
32. Tae said : I draw the LINE OF THE
SACRED CIReLE unto 'fhee, J ehovih. In Thy
name I dedicate and enclose this, Thy PLACE
OF THE HOLY COVENANT, to be Thine forever!
33. 'fhe multitude responded: May I remem-
ber 'fhy LINE OF THE SAC
RED CIRCLE, J ehovih,
and comport myself within it for Thine honor
and glory forever !
34. Within this place am I about to covenant
myself to Thee forever, as a laborer to fulfill
Thy kingdom on earth for the resurrection of
man.
35. Response : May I remember the little
ones within this SACRED CrncLE, whom Thou
hast given into my charge, for whose welfare
on earth and in heaven, I am about to covenant
myself unto Thee, to make myself an example
and sacrifice before them dnring all my life.
36. Together: In remembrance of the pillars
of light in heaven, that surround the throne of
Thy Son, God of earth and heaven, we build
here a hedge and a fence, as a lasting testimony
that we dedicated to Thee, J ehovih, the enclosed
PLACE OF THE SACRED COVENANT.
CHAPTER V.
THE HOLY C
OVENANT.
THEN Tae and his hosts went into the midst
of the Place of the Holy Covenant; and
the hosts formed in a crescent, and Tae stood
betwixt the horns thereof.
2. And, whilst thus standing, Tae, being
moved by the Light of J ehovih upon him,
uttered the covenant, and his hosts, in concert,
uttered the words after him.
3. And these words were called, THE HoLY
CovENANT, even as they are to this day, to wit:
4. Thou, 0 J ehovih ! As Thou hast declared
Thyself in the Book of J ehovih !
5. To Thee I covenant myself, to be Thine
forever! And to Thee only, 0 J ehovih !
6. And I abjure all Gods but Thee.
7. And I abjure all Lords but Thee.
8. And I abjure all Saviors but Thee.
9. In this, 'l'hy Place of the Holy Covenant,
do I covenant myself unto Thee, to be only
Thine, and forever !
10. My corporeal body, I dedicate and cove-
nant unto Thee, to be in Thy service during all
my life.
11. Because Thou madest it out of Thine
own material, behold, it is 'l'hine.
12. The workmanship is Thine ; the mat erial
is Thine also.
13. I have no claim upon it; unto Thee,
and for Thy service, do I resign it forever.
14. Into my charge Thou gavest it unto me,
as the habitation of my spirit.
15. Because it is Thy gift, I will care for it,
and keep it clean and pure, before Thee, that
it may be acceptable to Thee, and to the
presence 0f Thy holy angels.
16. My spirit I also dedicate and covenant
unto Thee, to be in Thy service forever.
17. My mind and soul, I dedicate and cove-
nant unto Thee, to be in Thy service henceforth
forever.
18. My whole self, whereof I am made, soul
and body, dedicate and covenant I unto Thee,
to be in Thy service forever.
19. Out of Thine own self madest Thou me,
soul and body, and they are Thine only, to be
used by Thee forever.
20. Appropriate Thou me, 0 J ehovih, my
corporeal body, and my spirit, my mind, my
behavior and my thoughts, to be of profit to
Thee, for founding Thy kingdom on earth.
21. And I covenant unto Thee, J ehovih, I
will search constantly into mine own every act
and deed and word and thought, to make myself
true in the practice of Thy highest Light upon
me.
22. That henceforth, forever, I will search
to find the highest Light, and I will practice
the same toward all men, women and childre11.
23. Unto them will I not only do as I would
be done by, but more ; I will do for them, with
all my wisdom and strength, all my life.
24. I covenant unto Thee, J ehovih, that,
since all things are Thine, I will not own nor
possess, exclusively unto myself, anything
under the sun, which may be entrusted to me,
which any other person or persons may covet
or desire, or stand in need of.
25. Neither more will I talk of myself, either
in laudation of what I am, nor of what I have
done; but Thou shalt judge me, and hold me
accountable for shortness in word anJ behavior,
wherein, by any means, I may manifest self-
esteem or covetousness for fame, or the ap-
plause of men, even for any good I may have
done unto others.
26. Neither more will I censure nor criticise,
810
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 7
nor blame, any man, or woman, nor any child
over fourteen years of age, as an individual,
in all the world, for any shortness in word or
deed they manifest.
27. For they are Thine, J ehovih, and not
mine, to be led or driven by me.
28. To all these Faithists, my brothers and
sisters in Thy kingdom, will I deal and think
ar.:d behave, in affiliation, as gently and truly
as were they my own blood and kin, brothers
and sisters, or father and mother.
29. And over these babes, which Thou hast
entrusted to me, will I be as loving and true
as were they mine own blood and kin, sons
and daughters.
30. According to Thy Light, which Thou
mayest bestow upon me, will I raise them up to
know Thee, and to be a glory in Thy kingdom.
31. First of my teaching unto them shall be,
to make them know Thee, and to remember
that Thy eye is upon them, and Thy hand
above them, to bless them according to their
wisdom, truth, love and purity.
32. And I will teach them the way of the
43. Neither will we, now, nor forever, eat
fish nor flesh of any creature Thou didst c_
reate
alive.
44. And we swear unto Thee, Jehovih, in
regard to these our babes, which Thou hast
given unto our keeping, to found Thy kingdom
·on earth, we will raise them up to abjure war,
like unto this our oath unto Thee, and to prac-
tice not the carnivorous habit belonging to the
Uzians.
45. Neither will we use, nor permit to be
used, in Shalam, any intoxicating drink, nor
weed, nor root, nor gum, nor any other drug,
for the contamination of human flesh by intoxi-
cation or for stimulation unnaturally.
46. Make us strong and wise, 0 J ehovih,
in this our covenant and oath unto Thee, for
Thine are the honor and the glory of all things,
time without end. Amen.

12. The Voice departed, and then Tae, in his
own wisdom, faced to the east, and he said:
13. H ear ye, hear ye, 0 mortals and angels,
Jehovih's kingdom is founded on earth !
14. Then, Tae face\]. to the west, saying :
Hear ye, hear ye, 0 mortals and angels, Je-
hovih's kingdom is founded on earth !
15. Then, Tae faced to the north, and said:
Hear ye, hear ye, 0 mortals and angels, Je-
hovih's kingdom is founded on earth!
16. Next, Tae faced to the south, saying :
H ear ye, hear ye, 0 mortals and angels, J e-
hovih's kingdom is founded on earth !
17. And Tae made the SrnN OF THE CIRCLE
TWIC
E CUT, and his hosts answered under the
sign, J EHOVIH's DA.WN.
18. And, now, the Light of Jehovih came
upon Tae, and, of his own accord, he said.:
19. ' iVithout a covenant of brotherhood, be-
hold, we are like an unorganized school without
a teacher.
20. As satan, in the management of his
soldiers for war purposes, hath demonstrated
the advantage of power through discipline,
let us be wise in the Father's kingdom, by
discipline also, but in peace and righteousness.
21. Unity cannot be achieved but through
order and discipline and rites and ceremonies
and words.
22. Power is obtained more by concerted
oneness of purpose than by anything else under
the sun.
23. F or which purposes, let us become
organic for the founding of Jehovih's kingdom
on earth.
24. So that, henceforth, we shall be a unit
before the world, guided by Jehovih to the
single end of establishing a community that
can practice His commandments in full.
25. And, though we may fail in some meas-
ure, let us remember the generation we are
raising up shall have more advantages and
practice; and their successors shall also ad-
vance still higher.
26. Ultimately, all the world shall attain to
peace, virtue, plenty and wisdom.
27. Already are we covenanted to live our
all highest light, and to practice it.
28. How, then, shall we become organic, and
still have no leader or overseer ?
29. The highest wisdom in the state, or in a
community, is not with the majority, but with
a small minority.
30. The highest wisdom, which is the high-
est light, should guide the individual and the
community and the state.
31. Now, therefore, let us divide ourselves
into groups of tens.
32. And each gl'Oup shall select its wisest
man, as speaker, and his title shall be Chief.
33. And let the chiefs be a group also, and
they shall select a speaker, whose title shall
be C'chief.
34. Let the business within the colony be
divided into as many departments as there are
groups, one to each.
35. But let the united business of the colony,
in its relations to the world, and to sister colo-
nies, be in the care of the C'chief and the other
chiefs.
36. Now, behold, in the kingdoms of heaven,
when a matter is announced, requiring the
Holy Council's action, each and all the mem-
bers who desire, speak thereon, giving their
highest light.
37. And, after that, the chief giveth his
highest light, which is the decree.
38. So let it be with us.
39. And it shall be discovered in a short
time who is the highest light, not only of each
group, but of all the groups.
40. And whosoever is chief, shall be held
responsible for the errors or shortness of his
group; and whosoever is C'chief shall be held
responsible for the shortness or errors of the
whole colony as such.
41. Who, then, knowing that what is bound
on earth is also bound in heaven, is willing to
bind himself unto these heavenly laws for the
sake of Jehovih's kingdom on earth? II
42. When Tae asked this, the whole of the
multitude answered : In J ehovih's name, I
bind myself in this also.
43. Tae said: Then, in J ehovih's name,
repeat after me :
44. In the name of Jehovih, I bind myself
to the C'chief's decree ; and I bind myself to
the chief's decree also, and I bind myself in
the brotherhood of groups.
45. When they had thus repeated the words
of brotherhood, Tae said : Let the hosts form
in circle, facing the centl'e. ·
46. When they were thus formed, Tae went
round the circle on the inside, going with the
sun, shaking hands with each one as he passed,
saying: Welcome, my brother (sister), in the
Brotherhood of Faithists ; with thee, I cove-
nant to be thine equal and obedient servant, to
whom I wed myself both in this world and in
the next, for the resurrection of man and the
establishing of Jehovih's kingdom with mor-
tals.
812
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 9
47. Then, after Tae, the next one on his left
went round the circle also, shaking hands, and
repeating the marriage words of the brother-
hood.
48. And so on, they went, until all of them
had completed the Covenant of the Brother-
hood.
49. Tae said : I salute you all under the
sign, JEHOVIH's NAME.
50. And they answered, by his instruction,
in the sign, MANY IN ONE.
51. The Voice spake through Tae, saying:
Whoever, hereafter, shall join My kingdom,
shall repeat My Covenant and the Covenant of
My Brotherhood, before the C'chief and the
chiefs and before My chosen, in the manner ye
have done before Me and My holy angels.
CHAPTER VII.
FOUNDING THE GROUPS.
THE Light of Jehovih being upon Tae, he
said : Let the examples of Uz be not lost
upon you. .But where ye have learned, and
what ye have acquired, these shall ye appro-
priate wisely in Shalam.
2. For which purpose, it is wise that we
appoint our groups as now required, to be
added unto afterward, when more is required.
3. How say ye, then, shall we appoint groups ·
this day?
4. Thereupon, different persons spake, and
the sum of their wisdom was that there should
be:
5. A group of architects;
6. A group of clothiers ;
7. A group of dietitians;
8. A group of engineers;
9. A group of manufacturers;
10. A group of horticulturists;
11. A group of agriculturists;
12. A group of botanists ;
13. A group of nurses ;
14. A group of physicians;
15. A group of artists (sculpture, painting
and gardening);
16. A group of musicians.
17. And these were all the groups required
at that time. Accordingly, Tae proclaimed
them, and called for volunteers for each and
every group.
18. And these were filled, though, because
there were but fifty-two members, some of
them took membership in two or three groups,
so that all were filled.
19. The Light still being upon Tae, he said:
Since ye have made the groups, let each group
now select a chief.
20. Now, many of them spake up, saying: I
neither wish fame for being chief, nor do I wish
the responsibility of the position.
21. Tae said: Suffer me, then, to declare
the Light that is upon me; which is, that ye
are here to fulfill whatsoever Jehovih may put
upon you, with all your wisdom and strength.
22. Whether ye be made chiefs or not made
chiefs, it is J ehovih's work ye are here to ful-
fill, without any regard as to your personal
selves.
23. To covet chieftainship would be selfish;
to refuse chieftainship would be selfish.
24. vVe cannot found the Father's kingdom
with any other members than such as say,
with all their hearts, and mind and soul:
Whatsoever Thou puttest upon me, 0 Jeho-
vih, that will I do with all my wisdom and
strength.
25. To have faith in this way, is to have
faith with practice ; such a one is a Faithist in
fact.
26. Now, those who had spoken before re-
lented, saying : 0 J ehovih, what have I done ?
Behold, I tripped myself up even in the start.
Make this a rebuke to me, 0 Father, and hea~
Thou upon me whatsoever Thou wilt.
27. Tae said: What any one can do, it is
well done ; wherein he faileth, because of in-
capacity, behold, it is not his fault, but his
misfortune.
28. So, it came to pass, chiefs were selected
for every group, men and women.
29. And Tae was made C'chief. And so,
Tae delivered to each of the chiefs a synopsis
of his duties.
CHAPTER VIII.
TO the chief of architecture, Tae said: Thy
duties shall be one with thy group, and
what I say to thee shall apply to them also.
Thou shalt not only build houses for Shalam,
providing them comfortably with rooms and
with wholesome conveniences, but thou shalt
teach our adopted infants, by models and other-
wise, the art and science of architecture.
2. At a very E;arly age thou shalt explain to
them, by blocks and with tools, the science
and measnrements of architecture, as to the
names and kinds thereof, to the place and use
of braces, beams and roofs.
3. Moreover, as soon as they are capable of
813
10 OAHSPE.
holding a pencil, thou· shalt teach them to
make drafts of houses, and the parts thereof.
Auel when they are old enough to handle
tools, thou shalt teach them to make models of
houses, and to estimate the strength of the
parts required.
4. To the chief of clothiers, Tae said : Thy
duties shall be one with thy group, and what
I say to thee is to them also. Thou shalt not
only provide clothing for Shalam, in wisdom
as to comfort, pattern and beauty, but thou
shalt prepare the way to teach these, our
adopted infants, the art and workmanship of
clothing the human form in the way most con-
ducive to health and comfort.
5. At an early age thou shalt teach them
the art of sewing and cutting, providing for
them models in human form, so they may
learn everything from a hat to a shoe, as to the
material used, the strength required, and how
to determine the same.
6. To the chief of dietitians, Tae said: Thou
and thy group shall be one; what I say to
thee is to them also. Thou shalt determine
and provide diet for Shalam; as to the best
herbivorous foods, and how to prepare them,
and how to preserve such as shall be kept
over.
7. In this matter thou shalt determine and
explain the constituent parts of the human
body, and shalt find and provide herbivorous
elements adapted to development and purity,
so that the best and strongest and healthiest
of men and women may be made out of these,
our adopted infants. Neither shalt thou fol-
low whims or fancies; but thou shalt support
thyself by facts collected from the different
nations of the earth.
8. And in the preparation of food, thou
shalt teach these infants the art and the
properties and all things pertaining to food
and diet. And explain to them the blood-
thirsty character of carnivorous animals, and
carnivorous people, giving them facts and
figures, so that in all thou teachest them they
shall be learned wisely, and not in conceit
merely.
9. Thus spake Tae to all the chiefs, explain-
ing to them their parts. And after he had
finished with them individually, then he spake
to them collectively, saying:
10. The greatest of all learning is to learn
how to live in the best way, that we may be
happy here and hereafter. There is no other
nor hair nor feathers to cover his body; and
yet He created him too tender to live without
covering.
12. In sexual relation, man and woman
alone, of all the animal world, can be taught
shame. ·
13. Whatever dress attracteth the least
thought to sex is the most modest dress : what-
ever dress giveth the fullest, best development
to all parts of the body, with adaptation to
comfort for the seasons, is the best dress.
14. Next to dress is diet. As to what is
best to eat, for the best, healthiest corporeal
man, and the best for the wisest, holiest spirit-
ual man, is the best diet.
15. These, with houses to live in, comprise
the chief requirements for the corporeal life
of man.
16. And yet, to produce these, and prepare
them unto man's service, many trades and sci-
ences have been developed on the earth.
17. Now, behold, in this day, Jehovih hath
provided amply unto us. He hath opened up
unto us the nations of the earth, where we can
go and witness many things, especially as to
the habits and dispositions of man; as to his
mode of life, in food and clothes and houses.
18. Now, behold, ye have taken a great work
upon yourselves; which is to raise up these
little ones according to your highest light.
19. Ye have bound yourselves to follow your
own highest light. And ye know that all light
is progressive. Ye cannot settle down, saying:
I know enough !
20. But ye are bound to investigate. And
how can ye do this without acquainting your-
selves with what hath been proved amongst
other peoples ?
21. In some countries, infants are whipped
for crying ; in other countries, they are held
up by the heels; and, in some count ries, in-
fants cry not at all.
22. The chief of nurses shall discover these
facts, and appropriate them.
23." In like manner, shall every chief take
his part, and develop the highest proven and
possible standard.
24. As much as ye thus fulfill your places,
so shall be your satisfaction and happiness
afterward. As much as ye neglect your parts,
so will ye censure and accuse yourselves after-
ward.
25. As Faithists, ye accept all people as
angels; mortals are simply undelivered.
learning so important as this.
11. To man, J ehovih provided
26. All mortals are in an embryotic state,
neither wool preparing for birth (commonly called death).
814
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 11
27. Heaven is now, and is near, even within
all who will accept it.
28. At an early age, infants can be taught
that to se1'Ve J ehovih bringeth happiness ; to
serve mortal inspirations and surroundings
(satan) bringeth unhappiness.
29. Therefore, though ye teach our infants
about diet ·and architecture and clothing and
all other things, ye will still be but little
improvement on Uz, save ye teach them that
the chief aim of life should be to develop the
spiritual man that is within.
30. By this system of education in Shalam,
there shall be two branches, one relating to
corporeal things and one to spiritual things.
CHAPTER IX.
TAE said: Behold, the Uzians have schools,
and they teach their young by and in
books. But when their youth are thus edu-
cated, as to their b_
rains, their hands are useless
for providing food ii.nd clothes and habitations.
2. Education, in regard to corporeal things,
must embrace the manipulation and handling
of corporeal things for useful purposes. And,
foremost of all problems is : How to provide
the necessities of life with one's own hands,
that he may not be rendered a dependent on
others.
3. This shall be one of the first problems
ye shall make our infants understand.
4. Young children not only ask questions,
but they desire illustrations, with the privilege
of trying to do something themselves.
5. Their questions must be answered by
their nurses and their teachers.
6. It is not sufficient unto J ehovih's require-
ments of you, that ye put off His children with
evasive answers, or with incomprehensible ex-
planations.
7. Education mwit be accompanied with prac-
tice. As, for example, ye show the child cer-
tain seeds, explaining what will grow therefrom;
ye shall plant and illustrate. And when the
vine hath come up out of the ground, ye shall
not only illustrate its corporeality, but shall
display the life· therein as a manifestation of
J ehovih's Presence.
8. To simply teach the child the botany,
without reference to the spirituality that under-
lieth all living things, would have little effect
in turning the child's thoughts to its own life
and growth in spirit.
thus put to work in gratification of their own
desires to do something ; and their work shall
be educational, corporeally and spiritually.
10. And when they are large enough to han-
dle tools, they shall be permitted to work at
trades, or in art; and full and sufficient expla-
nations shall be given to all their questions.
11. And this shall come to pass in Shalam ;
without tiresome study and without tiresome
labor, these infants, at fourteen years, shall be
wiser and better learned than Uzians at twenty.
12. For they shall not be limited to one trad<0
each, or one occupation each; but, to a great
extent, all of them shall know all trades and
occupations.
13. For botany, they shall have a garden;
and for astronomy, an observatory; for chem-
istry, a laboratory; for clothing, a factory; for
horticulture and agricultme, they shall have
orchards, fields and gardens.
14. Such, then, shall be the method of teach-
ing our infants. ·
15. Now, as to Jehovih and His creations, in
magnitude and perfection, they shall be ever
kept before the child's mind, to exalt its grati-
tude and adoration, and to make it rejoice in
its own life.
16. II For there is not, in all the philosophies
in all the world, wherewith to restrain the
private life and habits from secret vice, save
through belief in Jehovih's eye being ever
upon us.II
17. Nevertheless, a child that is raised up
without learning angel communion, is but half
raised.
18. By the actual presence of angels, and
by children seeing them and conversing with
them, the proximity of heaven to earth becom-
eth firmly established in the child's mind, and
it beholdeth the fitness of one world to the
other.
19. For which education the infants shall, at
an early age, be made familiar with the unseen
world, by trainiµg in the crescent.
20. And their teachers shall try them to
discover su'is and sar'gis in them; and, finding
these talents, shall cultivate them in righteous-
ness and wisdom for the glory of the Father.
21. And it shall come to pass that many of
these infants shall not only see without their
corporeal eyes, and bear without their corporeal
ears, but they will attain to adeptism. ·
22. And the angels of heaven shall descend
amongst us, appearing s.o as to be seen, and
talking with us so as to be heard.
9. At an early age, these infants shall be
815
23. And, because of such exceeding great
12 OAHSPE.
light amongst us, no one shall practice decep-
tion ; for the minds and souls of all shall be-
come as an open book.
24. These are the promises J ehovih hath
given us ; by the signs of the times they are
proven probable. Through faith in Him we
shall make these things true.
25. In faith He will bless you all.
CHAPTER X.
N OW, whilst the organization of Shalam
had been going on, Tae and his hosts had
interspersed the same in laboring·; some in
building houses, some in digging and planting,
and otl;iers in clearing the ground from stones
and rubbish, whilst the women were busy with
the infants.
2. And it so happened that :tmongst the
hosts, J ehovih had provided a goodly number
of musicians, players and singers, who fur-
nished spiritual entertainment in response to
the prayers and sermons of such as suppli-
cated the Almighty.
3. In addition to these occupations, the
groups were cast into responsible positions
for the future; so that the members of all the
groups found it necessary to begin and pursue
a special line of education, themselves, so as
to become teachers.
4. Consequently, each group became as a
school in its specialty; for whoso had taken
it upon himself to live and practice his high-
est light was bound also to admit an increase
of light.
5. II J ehovih hath said: Two conditions have
I placed before all men, ascension and declen-
sion ; let no man stand still, for so I did not
create him.
6. Such as will not ascend, shall be in de-
clension ; such as desire not declension, let
them not stand still.
7. And I have given to My Gods and Lords
of heaven, and to wise men on earth, knowl-
edge to provide unto the multitude something
to do constantly, that satan (mischief) may
not enter in amongst them to their injury.II
8. Tae said : Now is kosmon; men and
women know of their own knowledge a way to
provide unto self-development in wisdom, vir-
tue, truth and affiliation. II
10. Jehovih hath said: In kosmon, purifica-
tion shall not come by baptism with either
water or fire. But each one shall turn his
thoughts inward, to himself, becoming a con-
stant magistrate, sitting in judgment upon
himself as to his thoughts, works and be-
havior.
11. To perfect himself in his part, in the
family of My kingdom, is My new command-
ment unto My chosen.
12. For no man perfecteth himself unto full
requitement whilst he leaveth undone that
which he might have done.II
13. After a while, Tae and his hosts divided
and apportioned the hours of the day; so many
to labor, so many to rest, so many to study,
thus to one thing and another, that the groups
might be orderly. Nevertheless, entire free-
dom was given to all the members to come and
go, to labor or rest, as they might elect.
14. Now, it so happened that more than half
of the people were celibates, and they reasoned,
and said, inquiring: Is it not better that the
teachers and nurses be celibates ? And this
question extended throughout the colony, so it
became necessary to determine which should
be. And though the question was not weighty
of itself, yet, in order to provide an under-
standing for similar questions, the chiefs of
the nurses and the chiefs of the teachers ap-
pealed to Tae, who was C'chief.
15. And the Light of Jehovih came upon
Tae, and he said unto them : Did either one
shirk .from service it would be plain what
should be judged for righteousness' sake. But
because ye are ambitious to do good work,
which is tedious, with many trials, ye all de-
serve great honor.
16. Because ye are ambitious to serve the
Father, by serving these little ones, your as-
pirations are noble. Because ye are willing to
yield to one another any preference, ye are an
example of holiness.
17. The question ye have asked, which is
simply : Who can be the highest best teacher
of an orphan child, a celibate who has never
raised a child, or a married person who hath
raised a child? is not a question, therefore, of
self-interest or self-gratification, but one of
knowledge.
18.· If I decide this matter, behold, it would
be simply one man's decision. Why should I
make myself responsible in a matter that can
be determined by yourselves ?
9. And it was so; the hosts of Shalam had
been chosen and provided by J ehovih as an
example of self-purifiers and self-instructors
for founding His kingdom on earth.
19. Take ye, therefore, sufficient time to
inquire as to the facts that have been demon-
816
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 13
strated. Go, find of married people who have
raised up children of their own in the right
way, and number their proportion to those who
have raised up their children in the wrong
way.II
20. The chiefs took the matter in hand, and
they not only examined those in Shalam, but
hundreds of families of Uzians, and again they
came before Ta.e, to report.
21. And this was the sum of their report,
namely: Every one accuseth all others, that
no married people have raised up their children
in the right way, and, yet, each one accrediteth
himself as having raised his own in nearly the
right way.
22. Tae asked : But how found ye the chil-
dren they had raised ?
23. They answered : They were all raised
in the wrong way. Though they were good
enough in their own parents' eyes, yet, to
others, they were far short of the mark of
either wisdom or righteousness.
24. Tae said: Why, then, since those who
have raised children have been failures, ye
shall surely not choose them. The celibates
have made no failures, for they have not tried.
25. Let this, then, be our rule and guide :
Since every mortal life should be made ripe
with experience in all things, and since celi-
bates have no children of their own, and since
these children are orphans and castaways, let
it be testimony that J ehovih hath thus pro-
vided the celibates as substitutes for natural
parents.
26. So, let the nurses and te:}chers, in their
youngest infancy, be celibates. II
27. And this was carried out in practice.
CHAPTER XI.
JEHOVIH prospered Shalam in every way,
more than had been possible to any other
people in all the world.
2. Whilst the nurses and teachers were pro-
viding for the infants, the rest of the people
were providing habitations, factories and edu-
cational workshops, and also tilling the ground
and ornamenting it with fields, gardens and
orchards, and with walks and terraces.
built their temples so durable that succeeding
generations forgot the art of building. Better
is it for man's talent to remain, than for stones
and pillars of iron.
5. For which reason, in kosmon, thou shalt
not build imperishably in corporeal things ;
but rather leave the way open for succeeding
generations to build also.
6. The temple of Jehovih, which was de-
voted to public worship on every seventh day
of the week, was provided with fountains in
the north-east and south-west, and with the
four lights of the square, and with the four
dark corners of evil and temptation, and with
a throne of Light in the east, with time-bells,
a gau and sacred wheel. The ceiling repre-
sented the stars and planets, interblended with
plateaux of the heavenly kingdoms. The east
was adorned with the rising sun, the south
with the sun at noon, and the west with .the
setting sun. The north was adorned with the
pole-star and aurora borealis. The belt of the
zodiac, colored in cream-yellow, crossed over
the ceiling and faded down the east and west
walls. On the south wall was the coil and
travel of the great serpent (solar phalanx),
from the time of the Arc of Bon (of Moses,
Capilya and Chine) down to the Arc of Kos-
mon, in the etherean heavens. Flags of golden
colors were provided for the four lights, and
were mounted on silver-colored staffs inclining
toward the altar of the Covenant; and this was
in the plac_
e Tae stood, betwixt the crescent
horns, when they had, on the first day, made
the covenant. And in the place of the crescent,
where the fifty-one stood, was laid a stone
crescent, provided with seats and gate-ways
for successive affiliations to J ehovih's kingdom.
The outside of the temple was of wood, and
was surrounded by posts made of native trees,
surmounted with a roof of cement.
7. When the temple was completed, Tae
said: Who but Gods could have made any-
thing so beautiful with such cheap material !
And if it perish in two generations, two things
man shall gain ; the third generation can build
another; and, moreover, we shall not have left
a temple on earth that will call us back from
the higher heavens for more than two genera-
tions of time, to look after mortals who might
applaud us.
8. In regard to worship in the temple, J eho-
vih had said :
3. In regard to the houses, the temple of
Jehovih, the temple of Apollo and the gym-
nasium were the most important, and, yet,
none of these were like unto the buildings of 9. As, in the olden times, I provided a
preacher to stand at the altar in the east, and
Behold, the ancients speak unto the multitude, behold, in kosmon,
817
the ancients.
·4, II J ehovih had said :
14 OAHSPE.
the multitude shall render an account before
My altar of their fulfillment of My command-
ments, and My C'chief shall respond in My
name.II
10. And such, indeed, it was ; instead of a
preacher denouncing people for their sins, it
was a place where the people returned thanks
and praises to J ehovih, with rejoicing, in an-
thems and songs of praise, with pleadings in
J ehovih's name for the Uzians to learn the
lessons of the new kingdom.
11. And it came to pass that Uzians did
come, and listen, and look on, and examine,
saying and inquiring:
12. Why was not this tried before ? A
people without a leader!
13. And whilst they pondered, they looked
upon tl1e meadows and lawns, the orchards and
hot-houses and the rich-growing fields, saying:
Is not this the garden of Paradise ? II
14. 'rhe temple of Apollo was devoted to
music, dancing, calisthenics, initiative proces-
sions, rites and ceremonies of amusement. The
interior was finished illustrative of proportions
and figures of symmetry and beauty. The
decorations illustrated attitudes, posings and
groupings. On the east summit was a figura-
tive illustration of the God Apollo with his
heavenly hosts, descending to earth looking at
a group of Drnks (ill-formed mortals) with
long arms, who were squatting on their
haunches. Apollo was illustrating, on a well-
formed model, to his angels, how the Druks of
earth were to be changed into shapeliness and
beauty.
15. In its external structure, the temple of
Apollo illustrated a combination of one thou-
sand rlesigns of architecture, arches, curves,
columns, pillars and so on. And yet all of
this was made of the forest trees of Shalam
and without cost.
16. Next to these was the gymnasium, which
contained also two swimming baths and one
hundred single bath-rooms.
17. Here were all kinds of places for de-
veloping muscular action, with swings, ropes
to walk, places for leaping, places for tum-
bling and climbing. This was under the charge
of the group of physicians. The temple of
Apollo was under the charge of the group of
musicians. The temple of J ehovih was under
the charge of the C'chief and his group of
chiefs.
18. Besides these, were the house of Archi-
tecture, the house of Mechanics, the house of
Horticulture, which adjoined the hot-houses
on the north and west. Here were grown all
kinds of fruit and herbs for food, and many
beautiful flowers, rich-growing all the year
round.
19. Then the Agricultural house ; then the
factories, for hats, clothing, shoes, cutlery,
and, in fact, all conceivable places required by
man.
20. And not the least interesting of all was
the house of the Nurseries.
21. Here were the heart and kernel of the
whole colony, the orphans and castaways
gathered up from amongst the Uzians.
22. Now, from the first of the inhabitation
of Shalam, the Voice had constantly urged Tae
and Es to make continual additions of infants
to the colony.
23. The Voice had said : Give thy people
plenty to do. Keep the nurses busy ; give
them little to mourn for coming out of Egypt
(Uz); keep them at work; keep them in the
rites and ceremonies.
24. Then Tae said to Es : Take thou one of
the women with thee, and go back to Uz ;
gather in more infants.
25. And that ye may be known and respected
by the Uzians as to your occupation, go in
plain black dress, without oddity, and I will
give to each of you a wooden triangle, which
shall be suspended on your bosoms by a cord
over the neck; for this is the symbol of earth,
sky and spirit, the three entities which con-
stitute the universe, being emblematical of
Jehovih.
26. So, Es took Hamad.as, a young woman
of Thessagowan, and went back to Uz, and in
the cities gathered up infant waifs and brought
them to Shalam.
27. And thus, every year, they brought from
twenty to fifty additional infants, and adopted
them in the nurseries.
28. -So that, in not many years, there were
more than a thousand orphans in the colony.
29. It so happened, in the second year of
Shalam, that a disease came amongst the cows,
and the physicians forbade the babes being fed
on their milk.
30. So, for some days, they were in. straits
as to how to support the infants till other
milk could be supplied.
31. And one Abbayith, an elderly woman,
said unto them: Why worry yourselves? Be-
hold, the corn is in ear. Go, gather it, and
press out the milk and cook it, and give to the
babes ; for this also is good milk.
'32. So, they gathered the corn and scraped
818
BOOK OF JEHOVI H'S KINGDOM ON EARTH.
it and pressed out the milk which, on being
boiled a little, was found to be excellent food
for infants.
33. Thus was discovered artificial milk, even
as it is bottled and sold to this day. And the
chemists also made water extracts from slippery
elm bark, and from flax seed, combined with
rice milk, and this also made an excellent
liquid food for infants.
34. J ehovih had said : Whether flesh or
milk or cheese that man useth for food, behold,
in the herbs and plants and trees I created, I
gave the same things. . Let man discover them,
and understand the fruit of My inventions.
CHAPTER XII.
ES, the chief nurse, had said: I must tell
you of the wonderful Light of Jehovih,
that always cometh to us in time of emergency.
Even at the moment despair is about to reach
us, lo, His Light provideth unto us.
2. I had undertaken to nurse, with bottles,
ever so many babes, more than was possible
for one woman to attend, taking one at a time
on my lap, but I could not get round in time.
So, also, I had had observation that babes
should be held in somebody's arms, and that
when they cried they should be taken up, held
upright, and diverted by walking with them
or by tossing them.
3. To do these things for many babes was
not possible for one nurse; so, after I had
prayed for strength and light as to what was
best to be done, the Voice came to me, plainly,
as if I had read it in a book, saying:
4. My Daughter, why thwartest thou the
way of My creations ? Had I designed My
little ones to be upright, I should have pro-
vided a way for them.
5. Thou shalt permit them to lie down, and to
roll about. Neither shalt thou encumber them
with pillows and cushions. Permit them to exer-
cise themselves by crawling in their own way.
6. And when the proper time cometh for
them to stand upright, and to jump, behold, I
will be with them. JI
7. Es said: Now, thereupon, I began a new
system. I not only searched to know myself,
but to develop these little ones. And when I
took away the pillows and cushions, giving
them double blankets to lie on, and opportu-
nity to exercise by rolling about, behold, they
grew in strength daily, and not only soon
ceased to cry, but began to sing songs (to me
they were songs) and to laugh and amuse
themselves with their hands and toes and what-
ever they got hold of.
8. From this little light, of applying the law
of development unto babes, I applied myself
to make them understand that they should
divert themselves, without depending upon
their nurses. For many of the orphans we
had received were little tyrants, having been
spoiled by former nurses, and they screamed
constantly, to make some one carry them about
and divert them.
9. Now, therefore, I perceived that Jehovih
required more of me than merely to feed and
clean these little ones ; the minds of the
spoiled ones had to be remodeled ; they should
be made to comprehend that no one was slave
unto them ; and, moreover, that they them-
selves should cultivate patience, gentleness
aud love, as better attributes than fretfulness
and authority.
10. For, let no one be surprised, even babes
can be spoiled to think themselves an au-
thority, with power to command obedience
from adults. And they discover, at an early
age, that to give vent to peevishness and pas-
sion bringeth the nurse to do them service.
11. And I saw, too, that some, even such
as could merely hold up their heads, became
jealous, to be the first fed, or the first washed, and
answered my negligence with fearful screams.
12. Now, it came to pass, when I ceased
taking them up to feed them, and did away
with the pillow-props, and laid them all down
alike, and gave them food at the same time
(according to their groups), I had not only
provided unto them better corporeal develop-
ment, but better spiritual development.
13. Such as had been peevish and jealous
ceased their former habits, and began to look
with respect to the other babes, rolling beside
them.
14. Not many months passed by till they
began to be interested in one another, exam-
ining their feet and hands, and evidently. try-
ing to comprehend who they were, and whence
they came. And they also saw in one another
a representation of themselves, appreciating a
fellowship that was surpassingly beautiful.
CHAPTER XIII.
TAE said: Never grew such straight and
handsome children as those of Shalam.
2. And it was so. And, moreover, they were
819
16 OAHSPE.
of all shades of color, and of all nations and
peoples on the earth.
3. And they were timed and disciplined
from the very first ; a time to be fed, a time
for bathing, a time for dressing ·and a time for
sleeping.
4. Beside these times, the nurses provided
music twice a day for them, and at regular
hours. And many of the babes began to sing
and to beat time to the music, even before they
could stand upright.
5. And when the children were able to walk,
the nurses provided them, in processions, with
music to their steps ; and a time was also set
apart for these.
6. Soon aft~r this, they were given simple
calisthenics; and, in time after this, calis-
thei1ics proper, for the development of the
arms, lirnbs and person.
7. Thus were they trained to keep time with
music; to carry themselves erect; to control
the motions of their feet, lirnbs, arms and
hands, and, also, made to develop the full use
of their joints. And they were taught the
names of the bones, joints and muscles, by re-
peating the words in time to the music, being
in songs and semi-songs.
8. Great were the delight and interest these
little ones took in these exercises; and it came
to pass, that even whilst they were little more
than babes, they had mastered the names and
uses of the bones and muscles of the body.
9. And they were timed and limited in exer-
cise, adapted to the most delicate and slender,
and to the most robust; and every one learned
simply by diversion, and not by talk or labor.
10. After this, they were taught marching,
slow and fast, even running to time in music;
and, after this, simple tournaments.
11. Simple tournaments embraced games of
hunting and chasing; some of them taking the
part of foxes or wolves, and others, the part of
hunters. Yet, in all these games, the teachers
and musicians took part, directing and caution-
ing, guarding and supervising the games, teach-
ing the little ones the oneness of teachers and
pupils. Teaching the stronger children to be
observant and gentle toward the weaker ones,

them all as brothers and sisters.
like little saints, and more of a lesson to their
teachers of the glorious creation of J ehovih,
than the teachers were to them of the wisdom
of man.II
13. Amongst their first lessons of labor were
those in the gardens, teaching them how to
plant; teaching them the names of seeds, flow-
ers, plants,· trees and all growing things ; ex-
plaining to them how J ehovih, by His Ever
Presence, giveth life and growth and form unto
all things.
14. And they listened, heeded, and, with de-
light, sought their turns and privileges to do
some little work.
15. Now, with the beginning of labor, with
them, was also the beginning of times and sea-
sons for recreation (play), which, for the first
six years, occupied the principal part of the
day. And, yet, every day they took lessons
of a few minutes in painting or drawing, or
demonstrating with blocks, cords, squares and
angles. .
16. At six years of age, they were entered as
apprentices to labor, devoting half an hour
daily to knitting, or sewing, or working with
tools, giving them an opportunity of manifest-
ing their best adaptation.
17. At six years of age, they were also taught
for half an hour one evening in the week to sit
in the sacred circle for angel communion, that
they might become conversant with angels,
seeing them, and hearing them discourse on
heavenly things. Here they were taught pray- ·
ing in concert, and the order of praise to Jeho-
vih and His creations.
18. And the angels appeared amongst them,
oft carrying them in their arms, and otherwise
demonstrating the tangibility of the presence
of the spirits of the dead.
19. And the children were delighted, often
ejaculating thanks unto J ehovih and praise for
His everlasting heavens.
20. Now was also the time that many of
them began to manifest su'is, being capable of
seeing and hearing angels whilst in normal con-
dition, and also of seeing and hearing corporeal
things miles away, and without their corporeal
eyes and ears.

820
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 17
2. The chieftainess sat in the midst, and was
representative of the Light, repeating from the
words of Jehovih or His Embassadors. And
the responses were by the children, and by the
angels, and many of them were after this man-
ner, to wit: ·
3. Chieftainess : I am the Light and the
Life ; My creations are for the joy and glory
of My Sons and Daughters.
4. Response: All Light is J ehovih; let His
Sons and Daughters rejoice in Him.
5. Proclaim Him with great joy; shout with
glee in the house of the Almighty !
6. C. : To show them the glory of My love,
and the wide dominions I created for their
everlasting inheritance, I send My holy angels
from My kingdoms on high.
7. R. : Who shall fathom the inventions of
J ehovih, and the foundation of His love ! He
provided His holy angels to come down from
the skies, the light and joy of His everlasting
heavens.
8. He fashioned a way for the soul of man
to live forever; from the resting-place of the
spirits of the dead, He bringeth them in the
Voice of His love.
9. C. : I have swallowed up death in vic-
tory; the pain of the parting, betwixt the liv-
ing and the dead, I have bridged over with
Mine own hand, for the joy of My chosen.
10. R. : Greater than life, greater than death,
is the Almighty; with His own hand He han-
dleth them as toys ; by His breath bloweth He
away all terrors.
11. He provided us a life on the earth to
learn earthly things ; death was His invention
to adapt us to His imperishable heavens.
12. Glory be to J ehovih on high; glory for
His beloved angels who come to bless us.
13. Sing unto the Almighty, 0 ye little
ones ; His eye guardeth over you ; His hand
reacheth to the uttermost places.
14. C. : The earth is My paradise; the songs
of My beloved reach up to My realms in the

15. R. : Proclaim the Creator to the ends of
the world; to His children He gave the earth
as a paradise.
16. Sing a song of gladness unto the Al-
mighty; with the harp and the horn, and with
the voices of His beloved, mete out praise for-

to the Almighty ; He answereth in fair fields
and plenteous harvests. He filleth the air
with sweet perfumes ; the color of the field11
and the forests are records of His skill.//
19. Now, during the chanting, the angels
came and joined audibly in the response, and
often took on the semblance of corporeal forms
and walked about within and without the sacred
circle, and, at times, spake a few words of greet•
ing and joy in J ehovih's name.
CHAPTER XV.
A T six years of age, the children were en-
tered in the school of oratory, and also
given the signs and graces of unspoken words
by means of gestures. And, _
now, they began
to take part in theatricals and operatic per-
formances.
2. For such purposes these two houses were
provided with angel chambers adjoining the
stages, and during the performances the angels
came in sar'gis, also taking parts in the operas,
ascending and descending before the audiences,
singing and speaking audibly, so all could hear
them.
3. Many of the plays and operas were com-
posed and prepared by the angels, who also
gave directions how to put the pieces on the
stage. And in some of the pieces there were,
of the children and angels combined, more
than three hundred performers on the stage
at one time.
4. Instead of the crude and loud-sounding
horns and hideous instruments, used by the
Uzians for their operas, the opera here was
provided with an organ of full power, and
with instruments of delicacy and sweetness, so
that the most refined ear should not be shocked
or pained by any crude or disgusting noise, so
common in the Uzian orchestras.
5. Now, as to the plays, whether in the
opera -or in the theatre, they varied on differ-
ent nights, as to being adapted to young chil-
dren, or to older ones, or to adults. But, for
the most part, the plays and operas pertained
to illustrations embracing a life on earth and
an entrance into the lower heavens, showing
also the part in real life which angels of purity
take in guarding and advising mortals, by in-
spiration, to righteousness, and also showing
how drujas inspire mortals to sensual things
and to wickedness.

of mortals ; and every lay was made a lesson
and sermon on life, so s mple a child could un-
derstand them and appl the instructions to its
own soul.
7. Herein, then, was the difference betwixt
the plays and operas i Shalam, as compared
with plays and operas ~ith the Uzians: "With
the latter, they apply tr the lives and adven-
tures of mortals, and _o histories of mortal
affairs and pccurrences wrapt up in inexpli-
cable causes; but the lays and operas with
the Faithists, in Shala1=, illustrated the same
things by showing the oauses that govern and
control mortals by spiril presence.
8. So that (for exam le), were it necessary
to exhibit a drunkard o the stage, it was also
shown how the drunkqrd was surrounded by
dark spirits (drujas), w~o inspired him to his
course; and also was e hibited the struggle of
his guardian. angels to s ve him, showing thus
how the choice lay wi himself as to whom
he would serve, satan oi
' J ehovih.
9. In the simple pl s, where the children
took their parts at fi ·st, they were taught,
without books, by repea ing after their teachers.
10. Auel here was a ~iew school, not known
amongst the Uzians; 'f hich was, to learn by
hearing words spoken, ~o repeat them. First,
they practiced with hall.£ a dozen words, then
with a dozen words, th~n with two dozen, then
four dozen, and so on. And it came to pass,
in a little while, many of the children could
repeat whole chapters, y simply hearing the
words spoken once.
11. Tae said : Here, first of all, began to
manifest that clearness of mind resulting from
an herbivorous diet w ich was and is wholly
unknown amongst -
the ziaus.
12. Tae said: And Jehovih further blessed
our children in su'is, o that many of them
who had not yet been t ught to read, could lay
a hand on a printed page, and repeat it word
for word.
13. Tae said: And their little playmates,
hearing them, could r peat the same things.

and three hours at fourteen.
2. Nevertheless, these thou shalt tempez
according to their strength and inclination,
making labor itself a delightful pastime.II
3. And it was so; all avocations were as a
change from one amusement to another. And
so great were their capacities to comprehend
all things, that, at the age of fourteen, they
were master of all trades and occupations.
4. Aud, of the first thousand children that
reached fourteen years, scarce one could be
found but was master of horticulture, agri-
culture (w;t11 botany), engineering, surveying,
landscape gardening, architecture and general
mechanics. They knew how to make shoes,
hats, clothing (also spinning and weaving
cloth), the mathematics of musical instru-
ments; and they were musicians as well.
5. Tae said: Though they lacked the age
and strength of full-grown men and women,
yet they had attainecl to practical knowledge,
the like of which had never been known to any
adults in all the world. Scarcely anything
was known that they could not make, or de-
scribe how it should be made. II
6. And yet, in all things, scarcely any part
had been taught them by means of books, but
by practical observation and by illustrations
and actual measurements.
7. Jehovih hath said: By My spirit, I move
infants to ask questions; answer ye them, and,
behold, they shall become as Gods. For this
is a door I opened with Mine own hand ; whoso
answereth them not, shutteth the door against
knowledge, and ill-useth My loves.
8. Tae said: With all that our children
knew, behold, we still rebuked ourselves because
we had not answered half the questions they
had asked us. II
9. Now, from twelve to fourteen, they were
initiated into the religious rites and ceremonies
of the ancients, after the manner as set forth
in the Book of Saphah, with explanations of
signs, symbols, emblems and the sacred imple-
ments; with the ranks of Gods and Lords and
Saviors and archangels; with the divisions of
the higher and lower heavens; with the first,
second and third resurrections in atmospherea,
as set forth in the Book of Ben; and with the
cosmogony of the corporeal worlds ; the posi-
tion and travel of the solar phalanx; with
actual observations of the stars, planets and

to save us. We bind ourselves unto Thee from
40. We covenant unto Thee, Jehovih, to
strive hereafter, forever, to save ourselves
from all sin and unrighteousness, in thoughts,
words and deeds, and to serve Thee with all
our wisdom and strength, by doing good unto
others as long as we may live.
41. Tae, of himself: Then, in Jehovih's name,
and by His authority vested in me, I bequeath
you liberty forever. Jehovih be with you all.
Amen.
42. In Jehovih's name we release our sav-
iors from all responsibility for us forever-
more. J ehovih be with you all. Amen !
43. Tae: Draw unto Me, and receive from
My hand, saith Jehovih. Whoso covenanteth
unto Me, I covenant unto him.
44. ·whoso registereth unto Me, shall be
registered in My heavenly kingdoms. Upon
the entrance in heaven of My chosen, behold,
My holy angels are there to receive them.
45. The brides and bridegrooms : We cove-
nant tmto Thee, J ehovih, to be Thine forever.
46. Register us in thy everlasting kingdoms;
make us acceptable associates for Thy holy
ones in heaven.
47. Teach Thou ns, 0 Jehovih, to look down
into our thoughts, words and behavior, every
day and hour, with swift remembrance to do
all the good we can unto others that we may
be an honor and glory in Thy works.
48. Tae: Come unto Me, My beloved ; re-
ceive from My altar the token of liberty in My
name!
49. IIThe marshals then brought the points
of the crescent together, in front of Tae, leav-
ing a space between. The guards, then,
brought the children with wreaths forward,
filed to pass betwixt Tae and Es, who had
advanced to the apex of the horns. The sav-
iors (the founders) drew up in single file, facing
the west.
50. And, now, at a signal from the chief
marshal, the brides and bridegrooms turned
in at the crescent, two and two, and, as they
did so, they gave the acacia to the founders,
whilst the wreaths were placed on their heads
by Tae and Es, the bearers passing the other
way. And, as they did so, Tae said:
51. Receive thou this token of liberty in
the name of the Almighty. It was grown by
Him, gathered by His loves, and is bestowed
by thy benefactor as a crown of J ehovih's
kingdom on earth.
this time forth, forever !
39. Tae: Whosoever striveth
self, shall not fail before Ue.
52. Es, in response: More precious is this
to save him- than the crown of any king or queen on earth.
In Jehovih's praise I receive it; it is an em-

blem of a new beginning in my life, a wreath
of liberty. The saviors (founders) said: This
acacia shall be my register before the Al-
mighty of your love. II
53. After this, the musicians sang and
chanted whilst the audience resumed seats.
54. Tae said : A new life is before you.
Heretofore, you have been directed and criti-
cised, and told what to do and what not to do.
Hereafter, ye shall not be thus disciplined, but
shall discipline yourselves.
55. As much ~s ye are thus bestowed by us,
so shall ye bestow one another. And, hence-
forth, ye shall not criticise or direct or dictate
to one another. As much as ye are free from
us, ye are free from one another.
56. Heretofore, ye reproved one another for
various trifling faults ; hereafter, ye shall not
·i·eprove one another, nor reprove any person
above fourteen years of age; remember con-
stantly that ye are not keepers or supervisors
over your equals or your elders.
57. And for such faults or shortness ye may
perceive in others, save infants, turn away,
behold them not, nor mention them. Such
matters are betwixt J ehovih and the doers.
58. And, now, behold, it is proper for you to
go into Uz, and see them, and observe how
they live, both in splendor and in misery.
59. For which purpose, ye shall be provided
in groups of dozens or more, and accompanied to
the cities of Uz to sojourn there for a season.
60. And, if it so happen that ye desire to
remain in Uz, then be it so; ye shall remain.
61. And, if ye desire to return hither, then
shall ye return.
62. But ye shall not return here as before,
as helpless babes, but as workers.
63. And, if ye elect to remain with us, then
shall ye make the covenant of brotherhood
with us, being one with us in all things, and
this place, or its sister colonies, shall be your
home as long as ye may desire.
CHAPTER XVIII.
W HEN the groups were prepared to visit
Uz, Tae himself took charge of one
dozen, going with them. As the incidents of
these visiting groups were similar, the follow-
ing account of Tae's group sufficeth here, to
wit:
2. Tae took them to the city of Meig, to the
most fashionable hotels, and bad them pro-
vided with every luxury, so-called.
3. Hardly had he them located, when they
came before him, saying : Our rooms are small;
the air of the city smells foul.
4. Tell us, what is the meaning, so many
people strolling about in idleness ? Why do
they sit reading papers ? Which are the mas-
ters, and which the servants ? How do they
know ? Why do the se1·vants not be masters,
and have the others serve them ? What beau-
tiful wagons ! What beautiful mirrors ! What
do the women have their clothes stuffed for ?
What are those bells ringing for? Are they
in the temples of J ehovih ? Take us thither !
What causeth these disagreeable smells ? See
that old woman with a half naked babe, and
leading that dirty child! Why holdeth she
out her hand as we pass? Is she a servant or
a master ? Why hath not some one told the
rich, it is wrong to pass that poor woman by
without helping her to a home? Why does
she not come into our hotel, and have a room?
What do the people mean about rights and
privileges ? Can one person in Uz have more
rights and privileges than another? And why
so?
5. What is that sour smell, down yonder, in
that cellar, where they talk so loud ? What
is sour beer ? See, behold, a man with a
bloody face ! Fighting ? What with, a tiger?
Are those the flesh-eaters ? Why do they
smoke ? \Vhy hath not some one told them
they should rather seek to purify themselves,
than to do in the opposite way? O, here is
the temple of worship, take us in!
6. Tae took them in, and they heard the
sermon, and afterward, they said :
7. 0 the mystery of mysteries ! How can
these things be ? The chief preached most
excellently ; he knoweth all the doctrines for
right-doing; but why is it that his people heed
him not ? Why doth he not gather up little
children, and raise them up to observe the
commandments ? He must be the best of men.
Take us to see him.
8. Tae took them, but a servant met them
at the gate, and demanded to know their busi-
ness.
9. They answered: vVe have come to con-
sult about the poor. Then the gate-keeper
withdrew a while, but returned, saying: The
preacher is not at home !
10. From an upper window, behind the lat-
tices, they saw his face; not at home !
11. They said : Can these things be ? 0,
take us to the poor ; to the streets of misery I

12. 'l'ae took them, and when they looked
about, they asked: Why do the poor live in
the dirty streets ? Why do they not go away,
and dwell in the beautiful places? Who gave
these different allotments to the rich and poor?
Why do the poor not clean themselves, and
clean their clothes, and clean their houses ?
Why do the poor remain in the cities ? Aud
huddle together in such little rooms?
different places in the city of Meig, in the land
of Uz.
23. Now, after the time of the visit was
completed, Tae said unto them: What will
you, l·emain in Uz, or return to Shalam ?
24. And they answered : 0, .take us back;
give us clear air to breathe; let us be where
we can hear and see J ehovih !
25. But since thou and thy people gathered
us up in Uz, and bore us hence, let us go and
gather up infants also, and take them with us.
We will raise them up in the Light of our
Father in heaven.
26. So, in fact, did they ; and they returned
to Shalam, taking with them a great number
of waifs and castaways and orphan babes.
CHAPTER XIX.
13. What is that large house ? A theolog-
ical college? What is that for ? What is the
meaning of, teaching religion? Can it be
learned with words ? What is the reason they
do not live religion? Why hath not some one
explained to the professors that religion is a
thing of practice ? Could not they under-
starrd? Why do they not love their neighbors
as themselves? Dividing up what they have,
with the poor? Why do these children go
without shoes, and so ragged and dirty ? Why
do not the professors and students iu the the- WHEN the multitude returned to Shalam,

22. Thus, Tae explained the tens of thou- 11. Beware of disappointments and trials

BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 23
men to desire to reap too quickly the harvest,
and to consider its fullness, rather than to con-
template the labor of tilling the ground and of
sowing?
12. For the spirit of man conceiveth the
result of perfection; but the judgment looketh
to the labor required to bring it about.
13. Who, then, having the joys and fullness
of Shalam, will turn away from them, in order
to build another place, and yet, the while, not
repine for his choice ?
14. A colony shall stand as an individual
before Jehovih. A colony may thwart its own
righteousness by living for itself only.
15. The whole world is to be redeemed. It
is not sufficient for Shalam to say : Behold, I
am the fullness of the Father's kingdom. Let
others go and do as I have done!
16. The selfishness of a colony shall be, there-
fore, guarded against, even as the selfishness of
an individual.
17. Discipline, as regardeth the means and
power of a colony, shall manifest in directing
to the given purpose of founding the Father's
kingdom.
18. Shalam .might appropriate her excess of ·
production, by sending into Uz, and giving to
the poor.
19. J ehovih forbid that this should be done.
The business of Shalam is not to distribute
charity where it would thwart its own purpose.
20. Shalam shall use her excess of means to
extending the Father's kingdom, in building
new colonies.
21. Jehovih is with us, and we shall draw
Uz unto us, to make them know Jehovih. To
feed Uz in his debauchery is to send him in
the way of destruction.
22. Guard ye, therefore, the appropriations
of Shalam to such as labor for J ehovih's king-
dom. As we have drawn a few away from Uz,
let us prepare to draw more.
23. The way is open for any to go hence to
found a. new colony. Neithe;r shall it be a
branch of Shalam, nor a dependent. But it
shall be an independent sister colony.
24. Neither shall it copy after Shalam, say-
ing: Shalam shall be our exalI,lple.
25. This would be following an earthly light.
26. Neither shall its people copy after Tae,
saying : Tae did so and so, let us also.
27. For this would be following a lower light.
28. But it shall follow the Light of Jehovih
as it cometh unto you who found it.
29. Save J ehovih found it, they shall fail
who attempt it.
30. J ehovih designed not that man should
build his house exactly like his neighbor's.
The misfortune of man is to copy after others,
instead of following J ehovih's Light as it com-
eth to himself.
31. Let not this misfortune come unto Sha-
lam's sister colony. Another locality will call
for other things. Be mindful of these, and
adapt yourselves accordingly.
CHAPTER XX.
A ND there volunteered, and went out of
Shalam, two hundred adults and more
than three hundred children, of whom more
than a hundred were infants.
2. And they went into another part of the
country, and came to a place called Busiris,
which was unoccupied. And they purchased
the country there, and settled, and called the
colony Illaem, signifying, healing waters, for
there were mineral springs on the place, said
to contain great virtue in healing the sick.
3. Now, in a similar manner to Shalam, so
did Illaem, building and improving the place.
But the people of Illaem had less hardship, for
they drew supplies and assistance from Shalam.
4. Nevertheless, they had also many hard-
ships ancl trials, for several years.
5. And J ehovih prospered Illaem also ;. so
that it came to pass, that it was established in
great perfection.
6. As to Shalam, after the first swarm de-
parted, the inhabitants sent back to Uz, of their
women, whose allotment it was, and collected
yet more infants, castaways and orphans, and
brought them to Shalam, and raised them in
the same way.
7. From this time onward, every year, a
goodly number reached the age of fourteen,
and they were also liberated from infancy, and
admitted as brothers and sisters. And, nearly
every year, a swarm departed out of Shalam.
8. .In addition to the infants admitted into
Shalam, there were also admitted many adults.
But these were examined after the same manner
as were those at the first founding of Shalam.
9. And none were accepted save those who
were Faithists in the All Person, J ehovih, and
who were willing to work.
10. Rut there came many of the poor of Uz,
seeking membership for charity's sake.
11. But none of them were admitted. llJe-
hovih had said: The laborers, in establishing
My kingdom, shall not do for charity's sake.
827 .
24 OAHSPE.
Their labor shall be to provide a way to pre-
vent poverty, not to alleviate it. Behold, I
will have a new race of people in the world,
and they shall not waste their substance on
those that deny Me.II
12. But the poor were fed and sent on their
way.
13. Now, it happenecl that many lazy peo-
ple from Uz, having heard of the beauty and
peace in Shalam, sought also to become mem-
bers, bei.ng willing to make any covenant and
to swear any oath, for sake of living in idleness.
14. But the Light of Jehovih had also
made this matter clear ; so that they were
suffered to remain a while in Shalam at work,
and to attend the schools of discipline, that
they might be judged; and, if found worthy,
they were admitted, but if unworthy, they
were rejected.
15. -
But it came to pass, that many who
came with no thought of self-resurrection, but
came for a home, to be cared for by others,
were entirely changed in their habits in a few
months, being converted in truth from worth-
lessness to industry and self-improvement.
1§. And many of these became zealous in
purification and in good works, even above the
average.
17. But nearly all who applied for admit-
tance were poor, or misfortunate, or dis-
couraged with life, and with the ways of the
world in particular.
18. Neither came many who were rich ;
hence the saying, the difficulty for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven.
19. For, having corporeal comforts, they
took little concern as to the spirit, and
especially as to affiliation.

and the spider and all manner of living things
which I created.
6. How think ye they hear Me, learning to
do My will ? Go I to them with lips and
tongue, or with a trumpet ?
7. I am Spirit; I am the Soul of things.
By way of the soul is My Voice unto every
living creature that I created.
8. But man locketh up his sonl, and will
not hear Me.
9. He heedeth that which cometh upon his
corporeal senses. And this darkness groweth
upon him, generation after generation.
10. Then he crieth out : Where is J ehovih?
Who hath heard Him ? Perhaps the ancients;
but none in this day.
11. Jehovih saith : I am as one on the top
of a mountain, calling to all people to come
up to Me. But they hearken to darkness at
the foot of the mountain, calling them down in
corpor.
12. Now, behold, whatsoever thou hearest,
or seest or readest or any indulgence that
raiseth thee upward, the same is My Voice un-
to thee.
13. But, whatsoever thou hearest, or seest
or readest that casteth thee downward, is the
voice of darkness.
14. Whoso studieth to know the right, shall
hear Me; whoso striveth to be all truth, to him-
self and to others, already heareth My Voice.
15. Whoso indulgeth in anger, or vengeance,
or in wrong-doing, casteth a veil up betwixt
Me and himself ; he shutteth out My Voice.
16. It is a talent to hear Me; I bestowed it
upon all the living ; it is seated in the soul.
17. By cultivation, it groweth; yea, it be-
cometh mighty above all other talents.
18. By its culture, man attaineth to all possi-
bilities, for so I created him.
19. When My Voice is weak, because of
the darkness of man, he calleth Me conscien\)e,
or setteth Me aside as a faint impression.

CHAPTER XXII.
THIS was commanded unto the inhabitants
of Shalam, to wit :
2. Ye shall not persuade any adult to come
into the Father's kingdom.
3. But ye shall say unto whoso cometh your
way: Come and see us, and judge thou, in
thine own way, what is best for thee and for
the world.
4. Others shall come to Shalam, inquiring
for curiosity's sake, and for the sake of relat-
ing mischievous falsehoods founded on a grain
of truth.
5. Therefore, be ye guarded, saying to such:
The time of word-doctrines is at an end; ex-
amine thou, and judge as thou wilt.
6. Others will seek to convict you of self-
righteousness. Therefore, if they inquire after
this manner, to wit: Say ye, the Faithists are
immaculate ? or, say ye, all others are wrong?
then shall ye answer them, saying :
7. Nothing mortal is immaculate; and, as
to others, we are not their judges. Go thou.to
J ehovih, and inquire of Him. Sufficient unto
us is it to do all the good we can, having faith
in Jehovih.
8. Some will seek to trap you on the subject
of marriage, inquiring after this manner, to
wit :
9. Say ye, celibacy is higher than marriage?
or, is marriage the higher ? What say ye of
marriage and of divorce?
10. To these ye shall answer after this man-
ner: vVe are no man's keeper; neither say we
whether celibacy or marriage is the higher.
We give liberty unto all .to serve J ehovih, on
that matter, in their own way. One marriage
only do we permit to any man or woman.
And, though one or the other die, yet the sur-
viver cannot marry again. And, as to such as
are married, they can, at the option of either
one, return to celibacy, by being publicly pro-
claimed in the temple of J ehovih.
11. And if they inquire of you as to leader-
:;hip, saying:
12. Who is the leader ? Who is the high-
est? ·vvho is the head? Ye shall answer
them, saying: J ehovih. We have no man-
leader; no man who is higher than another.
V\T
e are brothers and sisters.
14. To these ye shall reply, :saying: All
men are J ehovih's. He designed the strong
ones to carry heavier burdens than the weak;
He designed the wise ones to teach the less
wise. vVhy, then, shall we give any preference
to one over another? They are not ours, but
Jehovih's. Sufficient is it for us to do our
own parts, with all our wisdom and strength.
CHAPTER XXIII.
I N course of time, the first heirs of Shalam
came to maturity and to marriageable ages.
And since they had been guarded as to diet,
and as to controlling their passions, they were
unlike Uzians in their general characteris-
tics.
2. Because they had never known to say:
This is mine, and that is thine, they were
without selfishness or selfish desires; looking
upon all things as Jehovih's, and on themselves
as laborers to render good unto others.
3. They said : We were created in order to
help rescue the world from darkness, and to
rejoice in our own lives, beca11se of such good
as we can do unto others.
4. Behold, we were orphans and castaways;
J ehovih wedded us to all the world.//
5. Having, therefore, wisdom and purity
within themselves, and, withal, having suffi-
cient association to choose from, they did
choose and wed for love's sake.
6. Nor did any worldly ambition control
their choice, or influence them in hope of any
gain as to their wedded partners.
7. And it came to pass that the offspring
begotten of these were indeed a new race in the
world, as to wisdom, love, purity and spirit-
uality, and new also as to beauty and shapeli-
ness, the like of which had never been before
in all the world.
8. And they were by birth so developed in
su'is, that, when they were grown a little, edu-
cation came to them without books. To see
and to hear, either corporeally or spiritually,
was all they required in order to accomplish
wisely all things required unto mortals.
9. And, with them, the heavens were as an
open book; the libraries of the heavens as the
sound of voices full of wisdom.
13. They will press you, inquiring : Some
men can do more work; some men are stronger;
some men are wiser; now, therefore, hew do
ye grade them that excellence may be known
and respected ?
10. And the angels of ancient and modern
times came, and stood by them, and walked
with them, revealing the past and the future.
11. And, now, the fame of Shalam and her
people was spread abroad, and, lo and behold,
829
26 OAHSPE.
colonies were springing up m the east, west,
north and south.
12. Hundreds of forest places and unoccu-
pied lands were purchased and put under cul-
tivation.
13. The wisest and best people began to
depart out of the cities of Uz. Many of the
Uzians, lawyers, preachers and priests and
physicians, g::
we up their callings. And they
went forth, saying: Alas, what good have I
produced in the world? 0 J ehovih, teach
Thou me the way to work in one of Thy king-
doms.
14. And some of the rich gathered up their
means, calling : Come, 0 all ye poor and help-
less ! Behold, I have purchased land; come
hither, and build a colony unto J ehovih.
15. And judges and governors gave up their
callings also, and went and joined the Faith-
ists, founding and practicing J ehovih's king-
dom on earth.
16. And kings and queens and emperors de-
serted their thrones, and went and dwelt with
the poor.
17. So, colonies of Faithists in J ehovih
spread in every direction, becoming the chief
foundation of the state and of the world.
18. And, yet, none of these colonies were
bound by written law~, nor had any of them
leaders or masters, nor any government, save
the Light of J ehovih.
19. Nor was one colony bound by the cus-
toms and commands of another colony; but all
of them lived by the highest Light that came
to them.
· 20. Nor owned any man, woman or child
anything more than the clothes he or she wore;
but all things were Jehovih's, in care of the
keeping of the colony.
21. Nor was there buying or seiling between
the colonies; but they exchanged with one
another according to production, and without
any regard to value.
22. And whosoever came and joined a colony,
bringing gold or silver or valuable goods of any
kind, donated them to Jehovih, and not to the
colony, to be distributed according to the light
thereof for the Father's kingdoms.
23. Neither labored any one for the colony,
but for Jehovih; nor did any colony hire any
man nor woman nor child to work for them.
24. Such, then, was Shalam and her exam-
ple before the world, of the Father's kingdom
on earth.
END OF THE HISTORY OF SHALAM.
CHAPTER XXIV.
THESE are the records of the C'chiefs of
. the Father's kingdoms :
2. Jehovih separated the people, the Uzians
on one hand, and the Faithists on the other.
3. And He said unto the Uzians : Because I
called, and ye came not ;
4. Ber.ause ye said: Thy kingdom come on
earth as it is in heaven, and ye put not forth a
hand in My behalf;
5. Because ye saw the multitude going after
intoxicating drink and smoke and opium;
6. Because ye rose not up, saying: Stay thy
hand, satan !
7. But shirked, granting licenses unto these
sins;
8. And ye have become a polluted people;
9. Given to drunkenness and to smoking and
to all manner of dissipation;
10. Each one casting the blame on others,
and hiding himself in self-righteousness ;
11. Thus opening the doors of your houses
of debauchery as a temptation to the young :
12. Behold, I am risen in judgment against
you.
13. My holy angels I shall withdraw from
your cities ;
14. Auel from your places of worship;
15. And from your government, and your
law-makers and rulers ;
16. For they have profaned Me.
17. Making laws and granting licenses to
carry on evils, knowingly and wilfully, for
policy's sake ;
.18. Hoping for personal favor and gain.
19. For they knew that what was not good
for one person, was not good for a nation ;
20. And that, whatever sin indulged in,
would, soon or late, bring its own punishment.
21. And they said: We derive a large rev-
enue from the duties and licenses for these
iniquities !
22. Thus hoping to justify themselves by
compounding themselves.
23. And I said unto them : A revenue thus
received shall be expended in prisons and
alms-houses, aud shall not be sufficient.
24. Because ye granted licenses, and pol-
luted the people, behold, the pollution shall
more than balance the revenues.
25. The criminals and paupers shall be a
greater burden than though ye received no
revenue.
26. Behold, I showed unto you that, as an
inclividual could not sin against Me without,.
830
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOIVI ON EARTH. 27
soon or late, becoming answerable unto lVIe, I
showed ye also that the same responsibility
and result would befall a nation or a people in
like manner.
27. For which reasons, and because of your
evasions of lVIy commandments, I called unto
lVIy God and Lords and lVIy holy angels, say-
ing: Waste not your time and labor more with
the Uzians;
28. Nor answer ye their prayers when they
call on lVIy name ;
29. And, though their chief rulers and law-
makers be in the throes of death, and they
call, saying: 0 J ehovih, heal Thou our Chief
lVIagistrate !
30. Yet, ye shall not go unto them, nor clo
them service more.
31. For they have become a conceited people,
saying : There is no God, and J ehovih is void
as the wind.
32. Behold, ye shall let them go their way ;
their cities shall become full of crime, for
angels of darkness shall come amongst them,
and no city shall be safo from theft, murder
and arson.
33. And vagabonds shall travel in the
country places, stealing and robbing and mur-
dering.
34. And their great men shall take bribes,
and their judges shall connive with sin; and
the innocent shall be confined in mad-houses.
35. Auel justice shall depart away from
them.
36. The employee shall pilfer and steal from
his employer; and the employer shall hire
others to look after those in his employ.
37. But all things shall fail them.
38. For I will make them understand, I am
the First Principle in all things;
39. And that I am Justice ;
40. And that I am Purity;
41. And that whoso raiseth a hand against
justice, purity, virtue, wisdom and truth, also
raiseth his hand against lVIe.
42. I made the way of life like going up a
mountain; whoso turneth aside or goeth dmrn-
ward, shall ultimately repent of his course, and
he shall retrace his steps.
43. 'fo a nation and a people, and to a gov-
ernment of a people, lam the same.
44. Righteousness shall be first and foremost
of all things.
45. Their governors and law-makers shall be
made to know this.
46. When they were a monarchy, I held the
king responsible.
47.. But when I gave unto the multitude to
govern themselves, behold, I gave also respon-
sibility unto them.
48. And they sought not to make laws for
righteous government unto the whole, but
sought to favor certain cliques of iniquities,
and to make laws to protect them in evil
manufacturies, and for traffic in tobacco and
opium and alcohol.
49. And no man more sought to be a gov-
ernor or law-maker for the good of the people,
or to serve lVIe ;
50. But he sought office for profit's sake and
vainglory.
51. Now, therefore, lVIy holy angels went
away from them, and no more answered their
prayers.
52. And the righteousness of the first days
departed away from them.
53. And they became a nation of money-
getters and servants of mammon.
54. And I l;>lessed not their marriages nor
their households.
55. And their sons and daughters respected
not their fathers and mothers ; for, as the
fathers and mothers respected not lVIe, so came
disrespect and misery upon them.
56. And their sons and daughters became
profligates and idlers, growing up for no good
under the sun, depending on their wits to work
out a life of sin and luxury. ·
57. And whoso married, peace came not to
them ; but contention and jealousy and bitter-
ness of heart.
58. And their offspring fell in the grades,
becoming outcasts and paupers and criminals.
59. Aud husbands and wives cried out for
divorceme.nt on all hands.
60. And the law-makers granted them and
favored them; but, lo and behold, the evil mul-
tiplied on the earth. .
61. In pity I cried out unto them, saying :
Ye may make laws forever, but lV[y kingdom
corµeth not by the road of man's laws. Except
ye turn about, and begin anew, there is no help
for you under the sun.
62. But they would not hear lVIe.
63. Then I sent lVIy angels unto them, teach-
ing them the same things that were taught of
old, amongst which were: As ye bind your-
selves on earth, even so shall ye be bound in
he:wen; as ye live on earth, serving self only,
even so, in a selfish heaven, shall ye enter lVIy
es worlds.
64. But they denied lVIy angels, and abused
lVIy seers and prophets.
831
28 OAHSPE.
65. In their own self-esteem, set they them-
selves up to judge Me, saying: There is no All
Person; there is nothing, save certain natural
and divine laws, and they are dumb, like the
wind ; they see not, nor do they hear.
66. Then I called out over the earth, saying:
The time of My kingdom is come. Now is the
time of My reign amongst mortals.
67. And those that had faith came; and,
behold, they have built unto Me.
68. I have a new people on the earth.
69. Again I called to My God and to his
angel hosts, saying: Behold, I have separated
the wheat from the chaff; I have divided the
sheep from the goats.
70. Go ye unto those that se''Ve Me in the
practice of My kingdom, for they shall become
the chief peopl . in all tho world..
71. The:,' shall rejoice and prosper in all
things ; they shall sing songs of gladness.
72. Their sons and daughters shall be an
honor unto them and a glory in My household.
73. Because they seek to serve Me by prac-
ticing good works with all their wisdom and
strength.
CHAPTER XXV.
THIS rule I made in all My works, saith
J ehovih: When I separate the people, the
good go away out from amongst the evil.
2. Even as I drew the Israelites out of
Egupt.
3. And, whoso go out, prosper in My hand;
I make them an everlasting people.
4. But those that remain, go down to de-
struction; and they become unknown upon the
earth.
5. Their great men are forgotten, and their
wisest men lose caste in the histories of a
thousand years.
6. Behold, these things I had made known
unto the generations of the earth.
7. Now, when I separated the Faithists and
the Uzian::;, in the kosmon era, I sent angels,
warning then. I said unto them:
8. Flatter not yourselves that man is all
wisdom; I say unto you, I am with the right-
eous; might shall not triumph through wrong-
doing. Behold, a judgment shall come upon
this people. .
9. When I begin to call them, My chosen
shall come and found My kingdom ; and they
shall come faster and faster every year.
10. And the Uzians shall fall into iniquity,
more and more every year.
11. And, now, behold what hath been!
12. The prince of devils came upon the
Uzians, saying :
13. Think ;not that I come to send peace on
earth; I come not to send peace, but a sword.
14. I come to set man at variance agaimit
his father, and a daughter against her mother.II
15. Now, therefore, when My angels went in
behalf of My bngdom, behold, the prince of
devils did invade the places of the ungodly.
16. And, whoso received My angels, and
practiced righteousness, were fallen upon by
the emissaries of the prince of devils, and un-
mercifully treated with curses and tortures.
17. But I called the righteous hence, and
they built unto Me My kingdom.
18. And I said unto the Uzians : Let this
be a testimony unto you of the power of the
Almighty;
19. Ye go about building ships of war, and
harbors for defence, with torpedoes, and with
all manner of wicked inventions;
20. But I say unto you, this nation, this
government and this people shall not be
attacked in the places ye build.
21. It is within.
22. For I will draw ~way the righteous, and
none but rogues ::;hall accept your great offices.
23. And this matter shall grow upon you in
the way of evil, declining in virtue more and
more every year.
24. Look, therefore, at; your grade; judge ye
the words of the Almighty.
25. My hands fashioned the signs of the
times.
26. As the hirer this day hireth one man to
watch another, even so shall it come unto you
in the great offices of your government.
27. By force and by might, ye shall hope to
overcome the prince of devils, but ye shall
fail.
28. And, in proportion as ye go down in cor-
ruption, even so shall the Faithists go away
into My kingdoms.
CHAPTER XXVI.
THE C'chiefs said: And J ehovih prospered
the New Kingdoms, as they were called
in mockery, for they were not kingdoms, but
the opposite.
2. Jehovih had said: A republic cannot fol-
low the highest Light; it followeth the majority.
And a majority is, and was, and ever shall be,
the lesser light.
832
BOOK OF JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON EARTH. 29
3, Therefore, a republic is not the all high-
est government ; and, since only the All
Highest can triumph in the end, behold, and
interpret ye what shall come to pass.
4. The ()'chiefs said: But many understood
not. Nevertheless, the Faithists had little in
common with the Uzians.
5. The Faithists established a reciprocity be-
tween different colonies.
6. For, some were suited to agriculture and
some to manufactures.
7. And they exchanged produce, so there
was neither buying nor selling between them.
8. And it came to pass also, that, as some of
the colonies were situated to the south, where
it was warm, and some to the north, where it
was cold, so the people went and sojourned in
any place suited unto them, continuing their
membership wherever they went.
9. Now, thus it did come to pass, in J eho-
vih's kingdom on earth, man was without a
government, such as man's .government.
10. And this was the next higher condition
that came up after republics.
11. The angels of J ehovih, perceiving this
was coming to pass, said unto the· Faithists:
12. Bother not your heads much about pass-
ing new laws for the Uzians; neither take ye
any part in the government, whether it doth
this or that.
13. For many men shall rise up, saying :
If the government would make a law of peace;
or, if the government would prohibit the traf-
fic and the manufacture of this curse or that
curse,-
14. But we say unto you, all these things
shall fail. Trust ye not in the ungodly to do a
godlike matter.
15. The societies shall fail; the Peace So-
ci'ety shall become a farce; the Prohibitory
Society shall be lost sight of.
16. Even the churches that profess peace
and temperance will not embrace peace and
temperance. They will fraternize with liquor-
traffickers and with colonels and generals of
war, for sake of policy.
17. The boast of the Uzians shall be : This
is a home for all peoples ; but, nevertheless,
even in the midst of their boastings they shall
make prohibitory laws to the contrary.
18. For they are fallen under the lower light;
none can turn them about the other way.
19. Under the name of liberty, they shall
claim the right to practice ungodliness.
20. But ye shall come out from amongst
them, and be as a separate people in the
world.II
21. Thi.Is it came to pass ; the people were
admonished by God and his angels, and by J e-
hovih speaking in the souls of mortals.
22. And those that were of the Spirit be-
lieved ; but those that were of the flesh dis-
believed.
23. Wider and wider apart, these two peo-
ples separated. And the believers, having
faith in J ehovih, practiced righteousness, ris-
ing higher and higher in wisdom and purity.
But the disbelievers went down in darkness ;
were scattered and lost from off the face of
the earth.
24. Thus, J ehovih's kingdom swallowed up
all things in victory ; his dominion was over
all, and all people dwelt in peace and liberty.

GOD REVEALETH WHO HE IS.
TJ:IIS is the word from the organic heaven:
2; Hear the words of thy God, 0 man -
I am thy brother, risen from mortality to a
holy place in heaven; profit thou in my wis-
dom, and be admonished by my love.
3. For as I am thy elder brother, so shall it
be with thee, to rise also in time to come, and
look back to mortals and call them to the
exalted heavens of the Almighty.
4. To J ehovih all adoration and glory, for-
ever, Amen!
5. By and through Him is all life and mo-
tion, and power, things seen and 1

6. Nor is there an angel in heaven so high,
or sufficiently wise to comprehend J ehovih in
His entirety, nor to see Him as thou seest thy
fellow man.

18. Howbeit the kingdom of thy God em-
braceth all the heavens of the earth. So is it
also with all corporeal worlds and their atmos-
pherean heavens - a God and organic heavens
belonging to each and all of them.
19. Nor is this all; for there is a third
resurrection, in which the augels rise still
higher in wisdom, love and power, and are
sent by thy God into etherea, mid-way between
the planets - the highest of all heavens -
over which there are Chiefs, who are also Gods
and Goddesses of still more comprehensive
attributes.
20. Therefore I am as any other spirit of the
dead, a one time man upon the earth, even as
thou art in this day; but one within the
organic heavens of the earth.

835
3 OAHSPE.
25. Second to this - that when the angels
of J ehovih should be appointed to mortals, it
should be as guardians over infants, to inspire
them by way of the natural consciousness with-
in, as to what was right and good in reference
to eternal life. And that such guardian
angels be in phalanxes of millions and tens of
millions (but still in close membership with .
thy God and his Holy Council) in order to re-
lieve one another on guard.
26. For, by the inspirations of the angels of
thy God, the individual entity of a mortal is
directed in its normal growth; but by the
angels of the first resurrection, mortals are
used abnormally, by en~rancement, by miracles,
or by sar'gis, oracles or otherwise.
27. That the angels of God might inspire
mortals with the same inspiration, behold, he
and his Holy Council prepared certain instruc-
tion with rules, words and commandments
adapted to the understanding of mortals for
the good of their souls, pandering not to their
earthly desires. Such words being designated
as sacred writings in the original, though for
the most part perverted or lost sight of after-
ward.
28. Chief angels over these phalanxes being
Lords, Marshals, Captains, and so on, the
second resurrection being orderly, disciplined
and organized in its glorious work.
29. Thus my Lords have angels under them
who are authorized and ordained in my name,
and in the name of J ehovih to abide for times
and seasons with mortals as guardians and
inspirers; to provide dreams, thoughts and
visions in the minds of mortals, and to other-
wise labor in elevating them in purity, love
and wisdom.
30. Such then are the angels of God and of
J ehovih. And their teachings are the same as
my Lord's and thy God's; nor doth one of them
teach a matter in one way, and another teach
it differently ; howbeit there are different
·grades and systems adapted to the different de-
grees of intelligence of the different peoples
on earth.
CH.APTER III.
GOD ILLUSTRATETH THE DIFFERENGE OF METH-
OD BETWIXT THE FIRST AND SECOND RESUR-
RECTIONS.
OPEN thy understanding, 0 man, that thou
mayest discern the beauty and glory of
heavenly places prepared by thy God, Lords
and guardian angels.
2. For as we came up out of the first res-
urrection, which may be likened to a great
medley, a noise and confusion of a mighty
multitude, so covenanted we with J ehovih to
make ourselves orderly, and a unit in growth,
manifestation, expression and future develop-
ment, that the place of the second resurrection
should do nothing in common with the first.
3. For alike and like J ehovih created mor-
tals and angels to attract each other ; and
since the aspiration and desire of most mortals
pertain to themselves as individuals, so the
twain bound themselves in the same pursuits
and earthly hopes.
4. For whoso on earth loved riches, or fame,
or great learning, or even evil, such as dissipa-
tion, drunkenness, gluttony, sexual indulgence,
or theft, gambling or arson, doing any or all
of these things for self's sake, or for evil,
attracted angel companions of a like order,
who, by inspiration or otherwise, led him on to
achieve his heart's desire.
5. And it came to pass when such mortals
died and entered the first resurrection, their
former inspirers became their companions and
rulers, having shaped their thoughts whilst in
mortality through their labors for self and
earthly objects. And these in turn became
angel inspirers unto other mortals of like char-
acteristics, so that a long period of time passed
away, before the spirits who were thus bound
to earth could be persuaded there were other
heavens open for them to come and inherit.
And as it was so then, even so is it this day
with the spirits of the dead.
6. As there are good lands on earth still
unoccupied, whilst in other regions there are
great cities with mortals crowded together,
starving, and dwelling in misery, and they will
not hence, even so is the great multitude of
angels of darkness gathered together upon the
face of the earth - and many of them will not
hence into the higher heavens of J ehovih.
7. As cold metal in contact with hot metal
changeth temperature, so by angel contact with
the spirit of man, knowledge passeth from one
to the other. So also is it of the passions,
sentiments, desires and aspirations betwixt
the twain.
8. Also, as where the sea breaketh upon the
land, and the twain are ever in contact, so is
the spirit world ever in contact with the mortal
world (which place of contact was named by
the ancients the intermediate world or place of
purgation, wherefrom none could rise till made
organically pure).
836
BOOK OF DISCIPLINE. 4
9. Now therefore thy God showeth thee
certain signs characteristic of the difference
betwixt the angels of the first and the second
resurrection :
10. Of the first, coming as individuals,
whether professing names, signs or histories,
and especially the ancients. Whose words are
uttered from the standpoint of the earth look-
ing upward.
11. But of the second, as light only. Whose
words emanate from my holy places in heaven
coming down to thee.
12. Of the first, flatterers, to win thy favor.
Whose counsel pertaineth to thyself and to
earthly things.
13. Of the second, to teach thee self-abne-
gation, and lead thee to do good unto others
regardless of thine own profit, caring little
whether thou art prosperous on the earth pro-
vided thou shalt be raised up in time to come.
14. Fol' the revelations of the second resur-
rection come from the light of my Holy Coun-
cil, who have abandoned their earthly habits
and desires, knowing the way of raising up
everlastingly is by constantly putting away
the conditions below.
15. Thy God cometh not as an individual ;
neither do my Lords (nor holy angels though
they come in my name). I come in legions of
thousands and millions.
16. Neither varieth the inspiration from my
kingdom one jot or tittle from what it hath
ever been, save in greater fullness, according to
the increase of capacity in mortals to receive
knowledge.
17. The spirit of my heavens pervadeth my
words; through my holy angels I have spoken
unto thee from thy youth up; and in my
revelations thou perceivest the touch of my
hand.
18. I cry out Order, Purity, Discipline, Jus-
tice and Good Works - or, Retribution !
19. 0 man, beware of angels who say: In
heaven there is no organization; nor God, nor
Holy Council, nor discipline, nor order, nor
teaching, nor self-denial, or,
20. Who say : There is no God, no J ehovih,
no government in heaven, or,
21. Who say : There is no bondage after
death; no place or condition of suffering, or,
22. Who say: When thou diest thy spirit
shall enter paradise and dwell in perpetual
ease and glory.
23. Who say: Heaven is an endless summer
land, with silvery rivers and golden boats for
all, or,
24. Who say: Eat, drink and enjoy thyself
for the gratification of thine earthly passions,
for when thou art dead thy path shall be
straight to glory.
25. Who say: Heap up riches, for there is
no punishment after death, or,
26. Who say : Turn not thy thoughts into
thine own soul to discover thy ungodliness, for
when thou art dead thy spirit shall revel in
bliss, or,
27. Who say: The angel world is a place of
progression without self-abnegation and good
works, or, ·
28. Who saith: Behold me, I am from the
highest, most exalted sphere, or from a far-off
star, or,
29. Who saith: I have visited the planets, or,
30. \Vho saith: Resurrection cometh by re-
incarnation - first a stone, then lead, then
silver, then gold, then a tree, then a worm,
then an animal and then man, or that a spirit
re-entereth the womb, and is born again in
mortality, or,
31. Who saith: Blessed art thou; for a
host of ancient spirits attend thee - thou hast
a great mission.
32. For all of these are the utterances of the
angels of the first resurrection. And though
they may inspire great oratory and learned
discourses, yet they are flatterers, and will
surely lead thee into grief.
CHAPTER IV.
GOD ILLUSTRATETH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
MORTALS ACCORDINGLY AS THEY ARE UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF THE FIRST OR SECOND
RESURRECTION.
CONSIDER the words of thy God, 0 man,
and profit thou in the application of thy
judgment for the growth of thy soul everlast-
ingly.
2. Of the first resurrection man saith : I
know my rights and dare maintain them.
3. Of the second, he saith: I ask not for
rights for my own self; whatsoever is put
upon me, that will I bear.
4. Of the first : No man shall impose upon
me.
5. Of the second: Impose upon me whatso-
ever thou wilt.
6. Of the first: Let me justify myself in
what I have done; behold, I am falsely ac-
cused.
7. Of the second: Jehovih knoweth my case;
837
5 OAHSPE.
neither will I plead in my own behalf. Who-
so is falsely accused, let him wait; in time the
Father will right all things.
8. Of the first : Let no man try to rule over
me; I will maintain my liberty at all hazards.
9. Of the second : S~nce no man in all the
world hath full liberty- why should I ask it?
10. Of the first: ]\fake me a leader; let me
be the head.
11. Of the second : Make me not a leader ;
lest I would feel responsible for those I led.
12. Of the first: I have done my share, let
others do as well.
13. Of the second: Though I do all I .can,
yet I am short before Jehovih.
14. Of the first: 0 that I were rich as my
neighbor, what a great good I woulu do!
15. Of the second : Take all I have, and at
once.
16. Of the first: Myself, and then my family
will I help; after that, others.
17. Of the second : We are all brothers ancl
sisters ; why shall we prefer one of J ehovih's
children above another?
18. Of the first : I will not consider my short-
comings, lest I be dejected in spirit.
19. Of the second: Teach me, 0 Father, to
look into my every act, word and thought, to
purify myself in Thy sight.
20. Of the first: What might the world say?
Ah! my reputation is at stake !
21. Of the second : What will Jehovih say?
With Him must I preserve my reputation, more
than with ten thousand worlds.
22. Of the first: ·whoso injureth me shall
suffer by my hand.
23. Of the second : Let us render good unto
those that injure us.
CHAPTER V.
GOD SHOW.ETH HOW MOltTALS MAY ATTAIN IN-
SPIRATION FROM JEHOVIH A.ND FROM THE
ANGELS OF 'l'HE SECOND RESURRECTION.
WHOSO ruleth over his own earthly desires,
passions, actions, words and thoughts,
being constantly watchful for the highest light
and greatest good, is on the right road.
2. And if he persist in this till it hath be-
come a constitutional growth within him, then
shall he hear the Voice.
3. Who then can judge him, save they have
also attained to the same high estate? Is it
wise for the unlearned to dispute with the
learned; or the unholy with the holy ?
4. Shall the drunken man, reeking with foul
smell, sign the pledge to drink no more, and
straightway say: We temperance men !-and
presume to dwell with the pure?
. 5. I say unto thee, till that man is purified
and grown to be constitutionally temperate he
is not temperate.
6. Consider then the seers and prophets (who
hear the angels) whether they have grown con-
f?titutionally to be one with Purity, Wisdom and
Goodness.
7. For this is required of such as presume
to hear me and my holy ones. And having
attained to this, who can judge them, save
they have attained unto the same ?
8. Shall a man inquire of the magician as to
the inspiration of the prophets of thy God?
Or the angels of the first resurrection be con-
sulted as to their opinions of my revelations,
and their words taken for truth without sub-
stantiation ?
9. Let all things be proved, or supported by
corresponcling testimony known to be true. As
the holy man perceiveth how things should be
in the heavens above, so they are. The unholy
man seeth heavenly things but dimly; he bind-
eth himself in ancient revelations which have
become corrupted.
10. Jehovih is as near this day as in time of
the ancients; put thyself in order, becoming
one with Him, and no book so easily read as ·
His created universe.
11. Inspiration cometh less by books, than by
what Jehovih wrote - His worlds. Read thou
Him and His works. Frame thy speech and thy
thoughts for Him; He will answer thee in thine ·
own behavior, and in the happiness of thy soul.
12. Great wisdom cannot be attained in a clay;
nor purity, and strength, to overcome tempta-
tion, till the growth be from the foundation.
13. The fool will say : The sacred books are
no more than man of his own knowledge might
write; yet, he hath not imitated wisely the
power of the words of thy God.
14. Let him do this well, and, behold, he
will also declare my words are from me. Yea,
he will recognize them wherever found.
15. It is the will and wish of thy God, that
all men become constitutionally capable of, re-
ceiving and comprehending the highest light,
and that they shall no longer depend upon any
priest, church, oracle or holy book, or upon con-
sulting the spirits.
16. That their behavior may make the earth
a place of peace, with long life unto all people,
for the glory of Jehovih.

BOOK OF DISCIPLINE. 6
CHAPTER VI.
OF JEHOVIH AND HIS KINGDOM ON EARTH.
0 MAN, apply thyself to understand the
spirit of my discourse, for herein shalt
thou find the key to the Father's kingdom.
2.- These are the rules of the second resurrec-
tion: To become an interpreter and worker with-
out a written formula:
3. That whatsoever giveth joy to thy fellow
and rendereth peace and good will unto all -
shall be called light : .
4. That whatsoever giveth sorrow to thy fel-
low, or discouragement to others - shall be
called darkness :
5. As to find fault with another, or to aggra-
vate unto displeasure - shall be called dark-
ness:
6. But to make another's burden light, to
encourage him unto strength and happiness -
shall be called light:
7. To be forever complaining about this or
that - shall be called darkness :
8. To be forever imparting cheerfulness -
shall be called light.
9. Now therefore whoso becometh a member
of my kingdom shall practice light ; but who-
so practiceth darkness, will depart away from
my kingdom of his own accord.
10. Neither shalt thou practice darkness upon
thy fellow for any shortness he hath done.
11. Nor shalt thou reprove him for error, nor
blame him, nor make thyself an inquisitor over
him, nor assume to be a judge over him.
12. Nor ask h~m to apologize, nor otherwise
seek to make him humble himself before.thee.
13. Nor shalt thou boast over him because
thou art wiser or st~onge1.. or more expert.
14: For all such inquisition cometh of dark-
ness, and shall return upon him who uttereth
it, in time to come.
15. Rather shalt thou discover the good that
is in thy neighbor, and laud him therefor, for
this is the method of raising him higher.
CHAPTER VII.
GOD SHOWETH THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT THE
RELIGION OF THE OLDEN TIME AND THAT OF
THE PRESENT.
hovih, even as in the olden time, which is the
Ever Present thou shalt set thy heart and mind
and soul upon to love and glorify above all
things, forever and ever.
3. The All Highest in thy neighbor which·
he manifesteth - that perceive and discourse
upon - all else in him, see not nor mention.
4. The All Highest subject - that discourse
upon-all else pass by.
5. The first lowest thoughts pertain to eating
and drinking; and on these the man of dark-
ness delighteth to discourse.
6. The second lowest thoughts pertain to
sexual matters ; and on these the man of dark-
ness delighteth to discourse.
7. The third lowest thoughts pertain to man's
selfishness, as bodily comforts and luxuries, as
ease and riches, as to what he hopes and desires
for himself; and on these the man of darkness
delighteth to discourse.
8. 'rhe fourth lowest thoughts pertain to criti-
cising others, as to doctrine, religion, philosophy,
behavior and so on, forever pulling all things to
pieces; and the man of darkness delighteth in
such discourse.
9. To abandon such discourse, and to dis-
coi.use on the highest subjects, in preference,
such as teaching, imparting knowledge, suggest-
ing remedies for the unfortunate and unlearned,
for improving in excellence the homes of others,
the agriculture, mechanics and such like; the
man of light delighteth to apply himself to
these, both in word and practice, forever build-
ing up.
10. Consider then what thy mind shall go
in search of, that it may pursue the highest.
This is serving the All Highest, instead of
darkness.
11. Now all of these things were tai.1ght in
the religion of the olden time, and were given
to man by thy God to raise man up toward my
heavenly kingdom.
12. Nevertheless this religion pertained to
man's own entity, a religion that was to be
answered either in reward or punishment upon
himself personally. His own salvation being
the subject paramount to all other considera-
tions.
13. And even where they founded brother-
hoods, as the brotherhood of Brahma; brother-
hood of Budha, and brotherhood of Jesus, they
TO the All One, J ehovih, now as in the olden were nevertheless but selfish brotherhoods,
time, and for all time to come, all honor whose aim was the salvation of each one's own
and glory, worlds beyond number. self.
2. The Highest Ideal, the Nearest Perfect 14. Neither was it possible in the olden time
the mind can conceive of-let such be thy Je- to give man any other religion, it being neces-
839
7 OAHSPE.
sary to appeal to his own advantages to make
him heed thy God.
15. But now, behold, 0 man, I come to give
a great religion, yet not to set aside the old ;
I come to such as do fulfill the old, and to give
them the religion of Gods themselves !
16. Saying unto them: Go save others, and
no longer concern yourselves about yourselves.
17. Go ye and provide a place of second res-
urrection on earth, where the people shall put
away all low thir:gs and practice the all highest.
18. And call ye out unto the Uzians to come
and inherit the place with you.
19. Nevertheless whosoever is only concerned
as to the salvation of his own soul is not yet
ready for the religion I give unto you.
20. Mine shall not concern themselves as to
their own self's salvation; for having faith in
J ehovih, that if they raise others up, with
their own wisdom and strength, they are already
saved, and without fear.
21. Compal'e then my second resurrection in
heaven with that which thou wouldst found on
earth for the glory and honol' of thy CTeator.
22. How chooseth thy God his initiates ?
Hath he censors ? - saying to all who come-
hold, be ye examined and tried, to prove ye
are worthy the second resurrection?
23. Nay, verily, for this would imply inqui-
sition - a court of darkness.
24. Now, behold, 0 man, after the second
resurrection was established in heaven, I called
out unto all the heavens of the earth, saying:
Come, all ye of the first resurrection, also, let
my guardians go down to mortals and proclaim
unto all people - the kingdom of God is open
to all who choose to come.
25. Now some, who were not strong in faith
in Jehovih said: Will we not be overrun with
angels of darkness ?
26. But thy God answered them, saying:
That is not our matter ; ours is to serve J eho-
vih by working for all whom He inspireth to
come unto us. Because any one desireth to
come - that is sufficient testimony that the
light of J ehovih is upon him.
27. Others said : What of the indolent and
the shiftless ? ·will they not overrun us and
thus set aside the good we aim at ?
28. And thy God answered them, saying :
When ye practice the all highest, behold, the
others will depart away from you.
29. Then others questioned, saying: Sup-
pose they who come shall practice darkness -
such as slander, or tattling-what then shall
be done?
30. And thy ·God answered them, saying:
Answer them not, lest ye also practice dark-
ness.
31. Again they questioned, saying: Suppose
they are good, but indolent ? Suppose they
say: Let us rest and sleep, J ehovih will pro-
vide for His chosen - what sayest thou of
them?
32. And thy God answered, saying : Censure
them not, for they are weak or diseased. Let
your example heal them. Is it not in the cove-
nant to do good with all of one's wisdom and
strength ? Because they do little, the matter
is betwixt them and J ehovih?
33. Lastly, 0 man, how can they, who live
the all highest, cast the first stone at their
neighbor?
34. For the act itself would be the commit-
ting of darkness.
35. Nevertheless whoso hath strength and
yet will not support himself -teach thou one
such man to change his attributes, and thou
shalt be honored amongst Gods.
36. Thy glory is to fulfill the all highest
thyself. When all who can, will do this,
thereon rest thy faith that the quickening
power and wisdom of J ehovih will sustain His
kingdom through His holy angels.
CHAPTER VIII.
GOD SHOWETH WHAT I S MEANT BY FOLLOWING
THE HIGHEST LIGHT.
BE considerate of thy fellow man, and weigh
his standing place in the sight of thy God.
2. For one man saith: My highest light is
to get money ; another, to get great learning;
another, to enjoy earthly pleasure; another, to
contemplate sexual relations; another, to serve
Buclha; another, to serve Brahma; another, to
serve Christ; another, to be efficient in war-
fare, and so on, every one from his own stand-
point.
3. Many are also under the prejudice of old
things, or the iufluence of a neighbor, or a
spirit or their surroundings, or the impulse
of their own flesh, and say: I too follow my
highest light.
4. Whereas they are in darkness altogether;
neither know they what is meant by the term
- highest light-often venturing an opinion
or a vague surmise instead, and believing they
are expressing their highest light.
5. For which reasons thou shalt explain that
840
BOOK OF DISCIPLINE. 8
only facts well known, or comparatively proven,
are light. An opinion is not light.
6. That whoso professeth light must know
the matter of his own knowledge.
7. 'rhat facts, numbers, figures or axioms
can demonstrate light; and that without these,
then the supposed light is only darkness.
8. Pursue this philosophy and thou shalt
easily discover who amongst you hath the
highest light; ,and also what kind of judgment
shall govern the chief's rulings.
9. Some will desire to consult the angels, as
to which - in a given matter-is the highest
light; but I say unto thee, thou shalt weigh
the words of angels even as if they were mor-
tals, exacting similar facts and substantiation.
10. Was it not the consulting of the oracles
that destroyed Vind'yu (India), Socatta, Fonece
(Phoenecia), Persia, Ghem and Greece? Such
consultation of angels is answered from the
first resurrection ; and it ever will be so, save
man exact from the angels facts and substantial
proof.
11. These, then, are rules of light : -
That
which is self-evident: That which is axiomatic:
That which is substantiated by facts: That
which hath a parallel in known things: Things
that lead to peace, order, and the uplifting of
thy neighbor and thyself.
12. Also to discipline thyself to be con-
stantly on the alert to be pure, good, truthful
and gentle in thy speech ; to practice right-
doing - these are following the highest light.
13. This though is darkness - to express
fault finding, criticism, censure, or even an·
opinion unsupportable by facts.
CHAPTER IX.
GOD SHOWETH WHO IS AND WHO IS NOT PRE-
PARED TO EN'l'ER JEHOVIH'S KINGDOM ON
EARTH.
W HOSO hath said: I have searched my
heart and mind, and, now before J ehovih
I desire to live a higher life.
2. I desire to put away my selfishness, and
passions, and sentiments of unrighteousness
and unclean thoughts - and words.
3. I desire more to serve others than myself.
4. I .desire no possessions, nor preference
over another, nor to be a leader nor a chief. .
5. I wish to discipline myself not to speak
of myself.
6. I would learn to speak truth only.
7. I would that I were affiliative.
8. I desire to do good unto others continu-
ally.
9. I long for association.
10. I will not criticise any person, nor cen-
sure them, or find fault with them.
11. I will conform to the rites and discipline
of the frate1:nity.
12. I will fulfill my covenants with Jehovih,
with all my wisdom and strength.
13. I renounce isolated labor.
14. I renounce the unorganized world.
15. I renounce the Uzians.
16. I consecrate myself to Jehovih.
17. I give up all unto Him.
18. What I do henceforth shall be by and
through the fraternity in His name.II
19. Then that man is prepared to enter the
Father's kingdom.
20. But these are not prepared to enter the
kingdom, who say: I want a home for com-
fort's sake, and where I may lead an easy life.
21. I desire this because I shall have oppor-
tunity to improve myself.
22. I desire this because I cannot care for
myself, and that I may be cared for.
23. Where I may shirk responsibilities. II
24. Weigh this matter, 0 man, and be thine
own judge as to whether thou art prepared in
heart and soul. Neither flatter thyself that
thou canst come in unprepared and not be
discovered. For soon or late thine inmost
thoughts will become known, and the fraternity
will not be thy place.
25. To put away flesh-food is easy, but to
put away dark thoughts and words - who can
do this in a day ?
CHAPTERX.
GOD REVEALETH THE CURE FOR REMORSE.
BE patient, 0 man, with thy neighbor and
thy brother.
2. Many men are far short in righteousness,
and without strength to accomplish to the
extent the mind conceives;
3. And for having done wrong suffer lament-
ably, with none to relieve them;
4. For which reason thou shalt provide them
honorable comfort.
5. In olden time, such ones confessed to a
priest, and he pardoned them, whereby they
were quieted and relieved of great distress.
6. In a later time, it was said : Confess ye
one another.
7. But in this clay neither of these is com-
841
9 OAHSPE.
patible with the intelligence of such as
be of J ehovih's kingdom.
shall Hear me, 0 God, I am weary of the first resur-
8. If then a man have remorse for having
wronged a brother or neighbor he shall so
acknowledge it to that member, and this shall
be restitution, even as if the wrong had not
been committed.
9. But if he hath wronged the "com1mmity,
then he shall acknowledge it to the whole
assembly, and that shall be restitution, even as
if the wrong had not been committed.
10. And in either case he shall not take
further sorrow or .
remorse, or shame, nor shall
any member ever speak of the matter after-
ward, save to comfort him.
11. But in all cases confession shall be made
in the name of J ehovih, and forgiveness like-
wise. But whoso seeketh to justify himself, or
to make it appear that he was but partly cul-
pable, or that another led him into it - that
man shall not be forgiven.
12. If he were led into it- then he who led
him knoweth it and shall exonerate him.
13. Whoso J ehovih hath created in prox-
imity as to time, country, place and association
- the same shall not be far distant on many
occasions in the next world; and in time to
come they shall be as if in a house of glass,
and all the deeds done while in mortality shall
be read as if in an open book.
14. For which reason thou shalt not tarry by
the way when thou hast wronged any man or
the community, but go quickly and confess,
that thy spirit become pure in the sight of
Jehovih.
15. Though thou grieve, saying: Shall I hum-
ble myself ? - I sa.y unto thee this is God-
liness, for it is the purification of thyself, and
the beginning of power.
16. But if a man wrong himself, as by pollu-
tion, dissipation, or otherwise, this is sin
against J ehovih ; and to Him shall he confess
privately, making a covenant with his Creator
to do so no more - which if he keep - then
the wrong is forgiven him, and he shall have
peace of soul.
CHAPTER XI.
GOD SHOWETH THAT THE REXUNCIATION OF
THE UZIANS IS NECESSARY.
rection and of the earth. Open the gates of
paradise unto thy servant.
3. And I say unto them : Whoso will put
aside all that is below, shall dwell in this
heaven; but whoso cannot in heart, and mind,
and soul renounce all that is below is not pre-
pared to enter.
4. Hath not J ehovih said on earth : Hus-
band and wife shall be the model and key of
My kingdom ?
5. As woman forsaketh father, mother,
brother and sister and becometh one with her
husband, so do they of the first resurrection
forsake all the earth and the lowest heaven in
order to become one with the kingdom of thy
God.
6. .For, save the mind and.heart be one with
my holy place, the love of improvement will
also depart out of that man's soul.
7. Isolation belongeth below the second res-
urrection, but unity is within it.
8. He who hath disciplined himself to be
honest in his own sight may be in error; he
who striveth to do good on his own account
may be in error as to an ultimate good; and in
all cases man alone is weak.
9. Yet no man can practice the highest
whilst living with those who are inclined
downward.
10. In the second resurrection the angels are
relieved of individual responsibility, all matters
being under the wisdom of the Holy Council,
whose head is thy God.
ll. First on earth, monarchies, then repub-
lics, then fraternities, the latter of which is
now in embryo, and shall follow after both the
others.
12. Behold, how hard it is for an ignorant
man to conceive of a state without a master,
or for the people of a republic to understand
a state without votes and majorities, and a
chief ruler. Yet such shall be the fraterni-
ties.
13. Have they not resolved their colleges
into teachers and pupils? By their ·superior
knowledge do these heads receive their places,
yet not as rulers, but teachers.
14. H ave they not resolved jurisprudence
so that testimony governs the rulings? Ac-
cording to evidence adduced and the knowledge

ED.J preserve the brotherhood against caste
and dictatorship.
16. See to it then, in departing, out of Uz,
that thou take with thee only things that have
proved good - the rest leave behind.
17. As Jehovih gave woman to man, and the
twain became one in their aspiration, hope and
labor, and especially with reference to their
offspring, so shall the members of the fraternity
be such as having renounced all the world, can
become one with one another, and espeeially
for raising up the young to become the Father's
edifice on earth.
18. As the husband is the representative
head of the family, yet he shall not tyrannize
over them,1
nor by his rulings make himself a
separate entity from the rest.
CHAPTER XII.
GOD DISCOURSETH ON LOVE.
MANY will come to thee, inquiring : How
sayest thou of such as are married, hav-
ing children of their own? Shall they so love
the fraternity and the kingdom of Jehovih that
they shall set aside their filial love, assigning
their children wholly to the teachers, day and
"
night?
2. Thou shalt answer them : Nay, in all the
fullness of their love, let them manifest unto
their little ones. And let this be a testimony
unto those who have children, how hard it is
for foundlings and orphan babes that have
none to love or caress them, that such parents
may add unto their ll'ousehold others also,
showing no partia,lity. And this is the highest
of all mortal attributes- to be impartial in love.
3. Not to abridge love but to extend it, God-
like, embracing all people, so shall the mem-
bers of the brotherhood labor with thy God
and his holy angels, for the glory of J ehovih.
CHAPTER XIII.
OF DESTROYERS AND OF BUILDERS.
ONE goeth about preaching against heav-
enly revelations, and against the wisdom
of J ehovih ; and his daring speeches ·and good
logic fall upon error~ and blunders in the writ-
ten words, and he draweth the populace, after
the manner of a gladiator.
2. Yet one such man that hath organized a
brotherhood for doing good - the world hath
not found.
3. Another man goeth forth preaching in
laudation of heavenly revelations, and on the
glory of J ehovih. The errors in inspiration
he heedeth not; the good he treasureth. He
may draw but few unto him, and his work may
seem little.
4. But in time to come his work becometh
mighty over all the world. He organizeth his
people in love and fellowship.
5. The latter is a builder· on J ehovih's
edifice:
6. Let these two examples stand before thee;
and when the speech of the vain man is directed
against heavenly revelations, saying: This is
not of God; this is not of J ehovih, or this
is not of· angels - know thou that that man
is not a builder.
7. But when a man saith all things are of
J ehovih, either directly or indirectly; what-
soever is good in them is my delight - know
thou that that man is a builder.
8. To strive continually to comprehend the
right, and to do i_
t - this is excellent disci-
pline.
9. To be capable of judging the right, and
ever to practice it within a fraternity - this
is Godliness.
10. In the day thou judgest thyself, as with
the eye of thy Creator, thou art as one about
to start on a long journey through a delightful
country.
11. In the day thou hast rendered judgment
against thyself for not practicing thy highest
light, thou art as one departed from a coast of
breakers toward· mid-ocean - like one turned
from mortality toward J ehovih ! like one
turned from perishable things toward the Ever
Eternal - the Almighty.
12: And when thou hast joined with others
in a fraternity to do these things- then thou
hast begun the second resurrection.
CHAPTER XIV.
GOD DISCOURSETH ON THE AUTHORITY OF HIS
OWN WORDS.
F IRST, freedom unto all people on earth,
and tO the angels of heaven, to think and
to speak whatever they will.
2. ·Second, that since no man can acquire
kriowledge for another, but that each and all
must acquire knowledge for themselves, thou
shalt dispose of whatsoever is before thee in
thine own way
3. Remembering that one man seeth J eho-

vih in the leaves and :flowers ; in the mountains
and skies ; in the sun and stars ; or heareth
Him in the wind and all corporeal sounds;
yea, he knoweth his Creator in the presence
of everything under the sun. And he is happy.
4. Another seeth not J ehovih, nor knoweth
Him. Nay, he denieth there is any .A.11 Person
in the universe. He is not happy.
5. One man distinguisheth the harmony of
sounds, and he is delighted.
6. Another man cannot distinguish the
harmony, and he findeth no delight therein.
7. So, of the words of thy God, one man can
distinguish, and another cannot.
8. The revelations of thy God portray the
harmony and glory of J ehovih's creations, and
of the organic heavens of His holy angels.
9. Whether thyself, or thy brother, or thy
neighbor, shall profess to reveal the words of
thy God - it is well.
10. Strive thou in this, and thou shalt im-
prove thyself thereby.
11. In the preservation of my words for
thousands of years resteth the rec.ognitiou of
iny authority.
12. I call all people unto me and my king-
dom; happiness proclaim I as a result of right-
doing and good works; whoever do these are
one with me in the framing of words.
13. To be one with J ehovih, this is Godli-
ness ; to be one with thy God, the .way is open
to all men.
14. To be organic for love and good works
- this is like the fraternities in heaven.
15. Whoever striveth for this hath my
authority already ; his words in time shall
become one with me and my works,
16. 'l'o improve thyself in these holy things
is to discipline thyself to become a glory to thy
Creator.
17. Let any who will, say: Thus saith God,
or thus saith Jehovih, or thus say I . Truth
expounded shall never di.e ; the discrepancy
from truth is short-lived.
18. Improve thyself, 0 man, to be sincere
in thyself and in all thou doest; and, when
thou hast attained this, thy words shall be
with power.
19. Remember thy Creator and seek to dis-
cover Him in the best perfections; remember-
ing that darkness knoweth Him not, but Light
proclaimeth Him forever.
20. For on the foundation of an All Person,
and believing in Him, lie the beginning and
the way of everlasting resurrection. Without
Him - none have risen.
21. These are the words and discipline; in
such direction shapeth thy God the thoughts
of millions. The twain are the authority
vested in me, thine elder brother, by J ehovih,
Creator, Ruler and Dispenser, worlds without
end. Amen!
