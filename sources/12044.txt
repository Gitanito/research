I was choking on a piece of candy I was given. It was early morning. Everyone had been asleep. I woke my family up choking. No one knew what to do. No one could help. I passed out on the floor in the kitchen, my family around me. Suddenly I was looking down at my body. I felt so peaceful. No fear just peace. Suddenly I was in my body again. I sat up coughed and the candy dislodged.
