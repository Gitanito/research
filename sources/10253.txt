  		              		Experience Description   

    17 hours of nonproductive labor before decision was made to do a c-section. Before they could do the surgery, I went into shock and quit breathing. Before I quit breathing, I told the anesthesiologist that I couldn’t hold on any longer. At that point I just let go or surrendered. I found myself high above everything going on and was accompanied by an entity but couldn’t see their face. The light was beyond what anyone could comprehend. I became very aware that all earthly things were gone and it was wonderful. The light was everything. The best way I can describe it is love in all it’s purity. Pure love like you don’t experience here. It seemed like I was there for a long time, but it was only minutes in earth time. There was no time there. You just are. But I was only allowed to go so far into the light. 

I kept trying to keep going and was held back. Finally, a “presence “told me I had to go back because it wasn’t time yet and I had more work to do. I said “no, I don’t want to” and a force like a huge hand pushed me back into my body. I abruptly woke up taking my first breath and there was a nurse on top of me doing CPR, screaming at me to breathe. Then the anesthesiologist told the doctors to go ahead and do the surgery before he lost me again. At that point, the anesthesiologist leaned down to my ear and told me it was ok to go to sleep that he was going to take the pain away. For a long time, I was rather upset that I had to come back but I knew why. After this experience, I began a lifelong search on different religions and beliefs. I always had faith since early childhood with church experience but not devout as in religious terms. 

This is hard to explain. I know for sure that God is the creator and Messiah was sent to give us further information and that the Bible is truth. I understand certain things most people can’t and consider it a gift. I don’t understand many things in this world and do not feel like I should or want to be a part of it as it is. I do not talk to anyone much about it and I realized a long time ago that if I dwell in that light too much, I can’t be happy in this life. So, I stay the course here, keep seeking for knowledge, do my best to adhere to the Truth, trust God, do the work I have here to do until I can return to that light, that place. In a brief sentence or two, it is a place of the purest and most simplistic form of love that you will never know in this life. The light, the love was everything and it was pure.

How do you consider the content of your experience?        Entirely pleasant  

Did you feel separated from your body?      Yes  When I left the body and was lifted up, pure chaos was going on below but I kept going until I was stopped, not caring about the body or returning.  I clearly left my body and existed outside it  

How did your highest level of consciousness and alertness during the experience compare to your normal everyday consciousness and alertness?        More consciousness and alertness than normal   So many things were revealed.

Were your thoughts speeded up?         No  

Did time seem to speed up or slow down?         Everything seemed to be happening at once; or time stopped or lost all meaning     Time is only of this life on earth. You wouldn’t understand. There is no such thing as time.  

Were your senses More vivid than usual?         More vivid than usual  

Please compare your vision during the experience to your everyday vision that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.       It was different. I could plainly see but there was a knowing that you would not understand.  

Please compare your hearing during the experience to your everyday hearing that you had immediately prior to the time of the experience.      Ears and hearing are from the earthly body. I could very much “hear” and speak but not like with a body.  

Did you seem to be aware of things going on elsewhere, as if by ESP?       No  

Did you pass into or through a tunnel?         No       

Did you see any beings in your experience?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any deceased (or alive) beings?         No       

Did you see, or feel surrounded by, a brilliant light?         A light clearly of mystical or other-worldly origin  

Did you see an unearthly light?         Yes   It was everything. I’ve never been able to describe it. There are no words really. Pure love, truth, simple, right, good, precious, all knowing. Nothing nothing negative. All negative had fallen away.  

Did you seem to enter some other, unearthly world?         A clearly mystical or unearthly realm     In the light but just in it. I wanted to keep going, needed to keep going. I just can’t explain it in human terms.  

What emotions did you feel during the experience?         Love

Did scenes from the future come to you?         No       

Did you come to a border or point of no return?         I came to a barrier that I was not permitted to cross; or was sent back against my will.  See above.  

God, Spiritual and Religion:       

What was your religion prior to your experience?      Christian- Catholic     

Have your religious practices changed since your experience?         Yes     Clearer the path.  

What is your religion now?         Christian- Other Christian     

Did your experience include features consistent with your earthly beliefs?         Content that was both consistent and not consistent with the beliefs you had at the time of your experience     Stay away from manmade laws that do not line up with Gods laws. I began to understand more fully who Jesus was and what he did and why. This was even after I explored many religions and doctrines which still don’t match up completely with my understanding. The Bible is the only source that explains it and my understanding of certain things goes a little bit beyond simply because the experience.  

Did you have a change in your values and beliefs because of your experience?         Yes     They became stronger, sharper in meaning.  

Did you seem to encounter a mystical being or presence, or hear an unidentifiable voice?         I encountered a definite being, or a voice clearly of mystical or unearthly origin   Accompanied by a presence whose identity was kept from me or so it felt like. Then there was the force, the voice that sent me back. I actually told the voice “no” and was pushed back into my body anyway.  

Did you see deceased or religious spirits?         I sensed their presence  

Did you encounter or become aware of any beings who previously lived on earth who are described by name in religions (for example: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, etc.)?         Uncertain   This question is hard for me because of religious doctrine. I know instinctively that it was the creator in the light and I felt like it was Jesus as the force because the 2 were different but one. The one who accompanied me the whole time was very different. I felt like I knew them but they intentionally would not reveal their self to me. It was like they all knew I would NOT want to go back.  

During your experience, did you gain information about premortal existence?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about universal connection or oneness?         Yes     Everything and everyone is connected. We are naturally a part of the light.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the existence of God?         Yes     The force and the light  

Concerning our Earthly lives other than Religion:       

During your experience, did you gain special knowledge or information about your purpose?      Yes   Knowing in a way that can’t be experienced here.  

During your experience, did you gain information about the meaning of life?         Yes     The work we do for each other to be able to go back to the light and love. There is much work to be done. The work has to be caring, positive, and if nothing else, loving. God I’d more powerful than anyone understands. Part of this is seeking the Truth. Being able to discern counterfeit forces.  

During your experience, did you gain information about an afterlife?         An afterlife definitely exists     Yes     A knowing  

Did you gain information about how to live our lives?         No       

During your experience, did you gain information about life's difficulties, challenges and hardships?         Yes     The work that I talk about is caring for others, fighting untruths, exposing untruths, learning more about Gods love and doing His work.  

During your experience, did you gain information about love?         Yes     I could not even begin to describe this. It is the root, the life, the salvation. Just everything, everything. It is everything.  

What life changes occurred in your life after your experience?         Large changes in my life     It changed my life. I understand the need to live a good, love centered life putting God above all else and trying my best to love everyone which is not easy. So much negativity and needless suffering goes on here. We are always facing wrong ways, beliefs, and actions. Sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s right and wrong. But, the earth is a beautifully created world that holds much goodness and joy and we were meant to be a priceless part of it. Together as it was originally intended. In His love. I hope and am trying to get there.  

Have your relationships changed specifically because of your experience?          Yes I know more about truth and the importance of faith and trust and how it plays into everyday life. Also, that we are not in control. We have free will to do what’s right because it is only genuine that way, but God is definitely in control.  

After the NDE:       

Was the experience difficult to express in words?        Yes   It was beyond any language we use. Our words can’t completely describe any of it.  

How accurately do you remember the experience in comparison to other life events that occurred around the time of the experience?       I remember the experience as accurately as other life events that occurred around the time of the experience.  In the days that followed, many nurses involved with the event verified what I remembered as being very accurate. So I know my experience was very real, genuine, and accurate.  

Do you have any psychic, non-ordinary or other special gifts after your experience that you did not have before the experience?         No       

Are there one or several parts of your experience that are especially meaningful or significant to you?          All.  

Have you ever shared this experience with others?       Yes    A few months. It was not favorable and I rarely share it since. It’s been 37 years.  

Did you have any knowledge of near death experience (NDE) prior to your experience?       No     

What did you believe about the reality of your experience shortly (days to weeks) after it happened?         Experience was definitely real     I questioned nurses and hospital staff to verify all that had happened in the operating room. It was very clear to me and still is.  

What do you believe about the reality of your experience now?         Experience was definitely real     It was and is very real. End of question.  

At any time in your life, has anything ever reproduced any part of the experience?       No
