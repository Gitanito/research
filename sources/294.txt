EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON BETWEEN CHANCE AND
THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE IN CORRESPONDENCE
OF DIAGRAMS.
By LIEUT.-COLONEL G. LE M. TAYLOR.
As may be seen on reference to the Proceedings of the American
Society for Psychical Research, Vol. I., Part IV., Professor Minot has
induced 510 people each to draw for him 10 diagrams on a postal
card; he has thus obtained about 5,000 diagrams. These he has
tabulated in various ways, and made the following deductions affecting
the inference drawn in England from certain experiments by diagrams
in thought-transference made by our Society. Mr. Minot finds a great
tendency among his respondents to draw certain particular diagrams,
and also when these diagrams are drawn there is a tendency to draw
them early in a series. He thinks "that the same visual images arise
in many of us with approximately the same readiness," and that owing
to this tendency during experiments such as those reported in the
Proceedings of the English S.P.R., "thought-transference might be
simulated and a proof of its reality obtained which would seem over-
whelming so long as the law of relative frequency was disregarded as
an explanation," and adds, "Until this is done it appears premature
to accept these experiments as valid proofs of thought-transference."
After reading Mr. Minot's paper, it occurred to me to try to put his
theory to a practical test. With this object I prepared 40 sheets of
paper by marking off on each side 25 square spaces headed, "Please
draw 25 diagrams without receiving suggestions from any person, one
in each of the spaces below, running down each column in succession,
beginning at the top of No. 1." I numbered the columns from left to
right, a~d on each paper wrote, "Begin on this side," and lastly before
issue marked each paper, 1 A (agent), 1 P (percipient), 2 A, 2 P,
&c., &c.
These forms I gave to my friends, who kindly did as requested, and
I thus obtained 2,000 diagrams which may be imagined to represent
the result of 20 experiments in "thought-transference" of 50 trials
each, but with the element of the transference of thought eliminated.
On comparing my "Agent" papers with the" Percipient" papers
of the same number, I found only one absolute correspondence, namely,
a square which came second in each of the two papers marked No. 13.
I found 10 cases in which there was such a correspondence in idea that

they would, I think, have been considered more or less successes had
the experiments been real, and 9 in which, though the ideas were
different, if they had been badly expressed, they might have been mis-
taken for successes owing to a likeness in shape.
The accompanying lithographs are exact copies of the above-
mentioned 20 pairs of diagrams, and give an idea of how far the cor-
respondence is carried. There are, besides, about 40 pairs having some
features in common, but which are not similar enough to be counted.
The rest of the diagrams which fall together in corresponding A's and
P's are quite unlike. It must be remembered, when making these
-comparisons, that though a larger number will fall together by chance
the more far-fetched the correspondences are made, the more will also
fall together in a genuine experiment. I should feel bound in the
latter case not to count any correspondence as due to thought-
transference unless there was a marked likeness in the diagrams
-concerned, and am consequently inclined to be guided by the same
rule in considering the present series.
At most, then, without the aid of thought-transference, 20 successes
were obtained in 1,000 trials. How does this result compare with the
~xperiments published in the ProceedingB of the S.P.R.1 Looking over
the diagrams figured in Vol. I., I find that in 42 attempts, of which
31 are reproduced in the volume in question, there are 13 corre-
spondences so near that, had they been found in my collection, I
should have noted them, namely-
Of those beginning page 83, V01. I., Nos. 4, 6, and 9.

18, and 22.
Mr. Minot's "law of relative frequency" has had no very marked
tendency to simulate thought-transference in my 20 experiments,
and this under conditions singularly favourable for the development
of such a law, seeing that all my respondents were people of the same
class, acquaintances, and living in the same neighbourhood.
Now, passing to a consideration of the collection as 2,000 separate
diagrams, I have classed them much as Mr. Minot has his 5,000, but
found two difficulties in doing so. First, there is the difficulty, when the
diagram is complex, as many of mine are, of determining to which class
it should belong. For example, I have the picture of a man in a boat
on a lake; should I call it a man, a boat, or a landscape 1 Second, the
question arises how comprehensive a class may be made. Mr. Minot
classes horses, dogs, and cats separately, and all other animals together,
but I only have 5 cats against 8 rabbits, 8 butterflies, and no less
than 46 birds.
Table I. shows that, though a tendency to draw certain diagrams

Experimental Comparison, &c. [March 28~
does exist, those oftenest repeated in Mr. l\finot's collection are not
the same as those which occur most frequently in mine. Geometrical
figures were preferred by Mr. Minot's respondents, while mine drew
diagrams representing men, animals, and flowers more often than any
others; both, however, show a partiality for words and letters of the
alphabet.
If the classes were made to contain objects so nearly alike that, had
any two of them fallen together as "original" and "reproduction" in
an experiment in thought-transference, the trial would have been
considered a success, the tendency in my collection to repetition would
fall below that in Mr. Minot's. How far below it is difficult to,
estimate without comparing :Mr. Minot's diagrams with mine, and
even then the estimate would altogether depend on how near a corre-
spondence the calculator considered necessary for a "success." If we
consider only those diagrams in each collection the names of which fix
both the shape and the idea, leaving only the size undefined, such as
circles, squares, equilateral triangles, hearts, &c., and neglect those the
short names given to which do not define them, Mr. Minot's diagrams
are repeated 90 times each on an average, mine only 5. If the whole
of Mr. Minot's pictures which are repeated more than 4 times are
taken, the average of repetition is 33 for each, as compared with 14 in
my series. The pertinent question is, of course, not how many diagrams
are repeated a few times, but how many times a few of the most fre-
quently drawn diagrams are repeated.
From Table II. it appears that the ideas conveyed by my diagrams
differ from those conveyed by the American diagrams a good deal.
owing, no doubt, chiefly to different surroundings. 1rIany of my
diagrams are complex rather than simple. I recognise in my series
little evidence of a" mental trick," though as I am conscious of having
such myself. I have no doubt that this habit accounts for some of the
diagrams, as when the only 5 "mouths" pictured are drawn by three
sisters. Some of my pictures owe their origin to what was easiest to
draw, or to what the artists thought they could do best. Many are
suggested by surrounding objects, and many are due to the mind
recurring to objects constantly encountered in the daily occupations of
the reproducer; but I do not think that anyone of these reasons should
be assigned 'as a cause for reproduction more than any other.
Table III. corresponds with l\Ir. Minot's Table VII., and shows the
aTerage place of the 10 most frequently repeated diagrams in the two
collections. I have not only given the average place of the diagram
"when it is drawn," but when it is omitted, taking it in the latter case
as 51st. My 10 most frequently repeated diagrams, when drawn, show
no tendency to come either early or late in the series. 1rlr. Minot's 10
most frequent come with me a little early. When every paper is
Digitized by Google
1890.] Experimental Comparison, &0. 401
included, whether it contains the diagram concerned or not, my most
frequent 10 come late, and Mr. Minot's very late in my series.
I do not find among my respondents any tendency to draw the
most frequently repeated diagrams early.
If, however, a striking tendency does exist to give preference to
certain diagrams and to draw these early in a series, but not to repeat
them when once drawn, the preferential ones will soon be run through
in a number of trials of thought-transference, and then will follow
figures for which the reverse of a preference exists. If thought-trans-
ference were simulated by the tendency above mentioned, we should
find in a series, first, an abnormal number of successes, then the proper
number due to chance, and towards the end remarkably few satisfac-
tory results. But this does not appear to be the case.
