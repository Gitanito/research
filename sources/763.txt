    Summary:&nbsp;  From Pat Deveney's database:

 Horoscope, The.
 A Quarterly Review of Astrology and Occult Science.
 1902-1904  Quarterly
 London, England.  Publisher: W. Foulsham & Co.
 1/1, October 1902-July 1904.  64 pp., 6 1/2 x 10.  4/6 a year.  The journal stated its purpose as to be a "review of reviews," but the it was an unfocused mixture of occultism and astrology.  Ireton (Ralph Shirley, 1865-1946) obviously learned his lesson from the journal because in 1905 he began the long-lived Occult Review.  Considerable astrological content, with articles by Walter Old ("Sephariel"), Heinrich DÃ¤ath, Maud Annesley, George Wild, and Walter K. Lewis, S.L. Macgregor Mathers (on Iamblichus), G. Fabius de Champville, et al.  NYPL; BL; Northwestern University.
