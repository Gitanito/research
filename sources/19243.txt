Dr Stephen Greer the head of the
disclosure project he&#39;s got big things
happening in DC coming up in regards to
disclosure do you guys remember the
national Press Club well Dr Greer is
back in Washington this was one of the
biggest events in early 2000 and now 20
years later back in Washington DC Greer
along with Michael schrat will be
presenting evidence
terabytes of information to the Congress
to the press to the Senate and it&#39;s all
happening in the midst of our new
documentary UFO end game to disclosure
and Above Top Secret they&#39;re still
making the top ratings on Amazon and
iTunes right now we got Dr Steven Greer
you&#39;ve been speaking about
how you&#39;ve been working with people that
work within the black budget projects
the people that budget it out these are
the people that are assigned to the
secret programs and the cover-up these
are the people that should be bringing
disclosure they know it but you&#39;re
working directly with them in Washington
what is their take in regards to the the
goal of getting this out to the public
you know it&#39;s been 14 months that I&#39;ve
been working directly with these folks
and unfortunately they are
uh you know hitting a wall in terms of
how far they can take this quickly but
they&#39;re persisting uh there have been
some unfortunate events that have
happened I don&#39;t want to talk about on
on camera however uh these are the
number top you know the number one
people in the entire United States
government who would have the highest
clearances
managing the three letter agencies
managing the black budget but who have
not been allowed to get anything through
channels
legal channels on the UFO the UAP
whatever you want to call it issue and
and the the issue here for me is that
this is no surprise when I briefed the
CI director 30 years ago this was the
situation when I briefed members of the
Senate intelligence Committee in the
early 2000s this was the situation
because what the public doesn&#39;t seem to
yet understand uh and most members of
Congress are just beginning to
understand this is that there are at
least two governments there&#39;s the
government that we elect and appoint the
constitutional government there&#39;s a
secret government that is far deeper and
embedded and more powerful unfortunately
uh than the constitutional government
and this is not a conspiracy theory this
is something we can prove in a court of
law no question so when you start
talking about what&#39;s happening in
Washington you have to understand that
the people who are tasked with getting
to the bottom of this when they make
inquiries through channels and within
the government they basically get
nothing because most of the people in
the legal government know nothing about
the issue at all
and if they begin to get close to people
who aren&#39;t working this subject both
external to the government as
contractors like at the Lockheed Skunk
Works or inside the government they&#39;re
basically
you know denied information
or threatened
so I think we&#39;re in a situation where
they&#39;re doing the best they can and what
our job is in the disclosure community
is to provide this positive evidence and
proof as well as the testimony of
first-hand people who are in the system
who can then verify the facts uh so
that&#39;s where an external organization
such as the disclosure project which I
founded in the 1990s
is is really becomes a key uh ingredient
in this whole process because
unfortunately until there is an open
hearing right now it&#39;s an investigatory
phase and the information is going into
a skiff of secure compartment and
information facility
under a t top secret special compartment
and information classification
what that needs to Pivot to is an open
hearing but to get to the open hearing
what&#39;s happened at least with the
initiative uh right now the law that was
passed in December is that people are
being rooted to this Pentagon office
known as Arrow aaro now of course that
office is somewhere between not knowing
anything or uh deliberately not wanting
to know anything
in my opinion so uh having dealt very
closely with these folks so this is
where it becomes even more important to
have a check and balance on Arrow and on
the Pentagon on this because as you know
in the past 70 years there have been
multiple committees and panels convened
and they&#39;ve all been dog Pony shows
designed to ensure the cover-up so the
only way you&#39;re going to break that
cycle is to have people who do know what
the truth is this is what we&#39;re doing
providing them with the intelligence
materials and the direct first-hand
Witnesses
and then they can be a check and balance
on the publicly acknowledged process
such as this Aero office so I think that
is really important that people
understand that is what we&#39;re doing and
will continue to do
in my opinion they&#39;ve made huge strides
in the last year year and a half and so
our job now is to try to prepare and
then bring to Washington which is what
we&#39;re doing actively the military and
intelligence and corporate witnesses
that are willing to go through the
current process we&#39;re hoping a number of
them and I&#39;m making an appeal right now
of them will do that and then some who
are comfortable doing so will come out
publicly
uh again uh we&#39;re doing a national Press
Club
uh event on June 12th Monday June 12th
at 2 p.m so and there&#39;s a conference a
two-day conference prior to that on June
10th and 11th at the JW Marriott in
Washington right between the White House
and the Congress a capitol building so
we will be doing that in the National
Press Club event
slated to be about two hours uh we will
be presenting uh an enormous amount of
new evidence and information from uh
some of the nearly 800 top secret
military and intelligence Witnesses we
have in the last two months
we have had about 60 new whistleblowers
come in to the disclosure project six
zero not you know 60. so this is of
course a huge undertaking because we
have to vet them I have to interview
them the ones who are willing to come to
Washington and give classified testimony
we have to arrange for them to come and
we&#39;re trying to see which of those might
be willing to come out publicly at the
national Press Club event
now there&#39;s something in between the two
that&#39;s happening and I can only speak uh
tangentially about it
but
we have had a meeting in the past week
with senior people in the Congress
who have green lighted and open
hearing on the subject not a classified
here right
on a key and relevant committee
now whoop this was in the early
discussion stages
it needs to happen and it needs to
happen I think in the next six months
we&#39;ll see if that can be made reality
the national Press Club event that we
need everyone to tune into support come
to
uh well only 500 people can fit in the
National Press Club ballroom but we have
the big Ballroom reserved and what I&#39;m
hoping is that that will create enough
social support political cover
for the a couple of dozen key members of
Congress Senate and House interest in
the subject to a very uh boldly move
forward out of a classified process
where the public is not informed and by
the way most of Congress isn&#39;t informed
uh to a very open hearing process uh
we&#39;ve been calling for that for as you
know for 30 years
um it has never happened in the history
of the United States uh every time it
starts to happen it gets hijacked by
members of this covert uh Co program
that that really doesn&#39;t want this
information out to the public so we&#39;re
going to see we&#39;ll just see if this
happens or not uh hopefully it does uh
it&#39;s certainly been I can tell you
this open hearing process through a key
and relevant committee has been approved
from the top down in the Congress this
is a big news breaking news story right
now uh to everyone uh just came from
that meeting uh this past Thursday and
uh we&#39;re now scrambling
to prepare for that because this would
certainly alter the course of what we&#39;re
going to end up doing on June 12th so I
hope everyone can come it&#39;s going to be
history in the making stay tuned that&#39;s
still over two months away there&#39;s a lot
happening every week one of the things
that has also happened in the last four
days I&#39;ve learned of a very senior
investigator for the U.S government
that was on the watch group list meaning
the kill list
along with a few of us who is leaving
the government uh this week and has
become an official whistleblower who
will be coming forward not at our
national Press Club event but publicly
later in June early July and it will be
um explosive given what this gentleman
knows the places he was able to go to
based on the intelligence we gave them
it&#39;s going to be substantial but I think
that what people need to understand
is when when these events begin to
unfold
the real question is
how is that going to be
watched overseen by the public because
it&#39;s very easy for covert programs to
Gaslight and deceive members of Congress
because if the members of Congress don&#39;t
know whether these objects are Chinese
balloons or what then they can have any
kind of credentialed scientists or
credentialed military or intelligence
official Co-op there and spew a bunch of
nonsense and disinformation
well what does that do that creates an
enormous problem of uh the whole process
being diverted into something false a
false narrative so of course there&#39;s
great promise with this but there&#39;s also
it&#39;s fraught with a number of dangers
and I&#39;m outlining right now
and this is and this is being headed up
by people who actually do know
that we have extraterrestrial Vehicles
they do know we have reverse engineered
craft they do know that there&#39;s a secret
government operation that&#39;s being run
illegally and unconstitutionally they
know this these are people that we have
duly and thoroughly briefed so I think
that this is a game changer
um it&#39;s dangerous because if if in fact
they stay the course and hold an open
hearing on this and they actually
subpoena
the witnesses we would recommend that
are subpoenaed some of them would be
cooperating Witnesses some of them would
be very hostile Witnesses but under oath
and since we have information about what
they know and what they&#39;ve done they
will either have to testify truthfully
or be put in prison for perjury
you know you speak of the PTSD even when
you were uh found out what was really
going on behind the scenes and you were
talking in our documentary UFO Ed game
about some of the PTSD that these people
are experiencing when you&#39;re briefing
them oh yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s take a quick
look at uh UFO end game to disclosure
and we&#39;ll be right back
so there&#39;s a hundred disclosure efforts
out there now and I&#39;d say most of them
are just putting out there it&#39;s an echo
chamber a parodyne The Narrative and the
script being written by these black
projects these illegal black projects so
I&#39;m a big skeptic I always have been I
mean if you take 99 of what&#39;s presented
on this subject
that you go to any conference or
internet search or what have you I go
that&#39;s false that&#39;s false that&#39;s false
that&#39;s false and can be provably so but
no one&#39;s listening because it&#39;s more
exciting to get all you know worked up
about a threat from outer space it makes
for excitement the juices get flowing
because humans love to have someone to
hate right we&#39;ve had some of the pilots
and the intelligence people talking
about them and now we learn that this is
an ongoing situation and it&#39;s not just
UFOs there&#39;s frankly they&#39;ve been
looking at other things which sound like
they come straight out of an X-Files
script and the demagogues running these
information Warfare programs and
psychological warfare programs they know
human nature they know how they can
trigger people into fear but also into
sort of less unite people around an
enemy short of
a couple of Little Green Men landing on
the south lawn or the North Lawn of the
White House and saying hi to the Press
Corps there or landing at the next Super
Bowl and dropping in
what is the what is the bridge between
these videos and we know that whatever
this thing is it is not human they want
a new enemy they&#39;ve been wanting to
build up a new enemy The Pentagon office
a lot of the folks I know in this city
absolutely realize that that office is
sort of a window dressing to comply with
the Congressional bill that was passed
mandating that the Director of National
Intelligence and the Pentagon report to
the Congress this issue but a true
investigation absolutely is not writ
large I&#39;m on the record here and I&#39;m in
a position to say this authoritatively
it&#39;s going to happen from that office
and they&#39;re involved with it they&#39;re in
close proximity all they have to do is
open the door and find out but they&#39;re
even being uh left out and what you&#39;re
telling them uh leaves them shaking in
their boots so again these people you
say it&#39;s a dangerous job look at what
just happened to our uh former president
what they&#39;re doing in regards to uh
what&#39;s going on in the world are these
people afraid wouldn&#39;t that well of
course they are I mean as soon as I got
off the phone with the most senior
person in the US government covertly
dealing with this I had a Blackhawk
helicopter hovering over my house
rattling my entire house yes of course
it&#39;s dangerous and of course it&#39;s risky
uh but you know I tell these guys who I
remember these folks are not politicians
these senior uh intelligence and
Military investigators who are assigned
to the government now as civilians
they&#39;re not
even though they may have been jsoc and
special forces and this and that these
are not people who are tighten the
loafer
political you know no offense to lawyers
lawyers and you know bankers and
businessmen these are people who are
hardened on the battlefield and hardened
in terms of Special Operations
and so they understand this but they
have never seen something like this I
mean one of the very senior folks that
I&#39;m dealing with called the group that
they&#39;ve encountered uh and by the way
when they you mischaracterize this
process when they were investigating
this issue
even when they went to the Lockheed
Skunk Works they were basically it&#39;s
shown quote a bunch of antique aircraft
with jets they weren&#39;t given any of the
information that was actually been
worked on out there in the desert so I
think that because that happened they
knew they were being gaslit and deceived
and because of that they reached out to
us after that we gave them enough
actionable intelligence and let me
explain what that means
here is the deep underground base where
this operation is located here&#39;s the
gate here&#39;s what&#39;s in that facility and
here&#39;s all the details that we have from
our hundreds of sources that&#39;s all been
given to them based on that they didn&#39;t
knock on the door and get it anywhere
they kicked the doors in
so this has been going on now for 14
months and uh so they have actually
gotten an enormous amount of information
but they&#39;ve encountered the kind of
thuggery that you would think is in a
bad conspiracy movie but it happens to
be true because remember this
organization running these covert
programs is the world&#39;s most dangerous
and largest criminal Enterprise Full
Stop in the discussion so uh forget the
mafia forget the worst terrorist cells
you&#39;ve ever heard of forget all of that
this organization is way worse
and more lethal and vicious so
unfortunately they have hit that buzz
saw but they have persisted and uh
there&#39;s a certain amount of cover that
we&#39;ve extended uh the organization
that&#39;s
been watching what we&#39;re doing who&#39;s
supportive remember this is the
refactions of this covert group and
there&#39;s a substantial faction that
thinks it&#39;s ridiculous this issue is
still secret I met with a man years ago
who worked this matter for a private
Corporation North Grumman and he was
astonished that it wasn&#39;t out by the
late 1960s and we&#39;re talking what 50
some years ago so I think this is uh
there are people who are extremely
committed to the truths coming out
and to the fact that the coover group
currently running these projects is an
existential threat to National Security
and to world peace and and future
security of the planet and I always
point out don&#39;t take my word for that
statement look at the very first or
second but technically really the first
uh CI director Admiral Roscoe helling
heater
and he stated in a letter to the New
York Times after a white Eisenhower gave
his famous the where the military
industrial complex speech and Admiral
healing heater stated that the secrecy
around UFOs is a threat to the National
Security not the UFOs the the secrecy
around it so now that was 60
two years ago uh now imagine the kind of
threat Matrix
uh that&#39;s presented after beyond what he
knew in in the early uh 1960s what has
evolved since then technologically
operationally et cetera and so on so it
is a very delicate issue and this is one
of the reasons why I think the next
phase and love uh of laws passed by the
Congress needs to be an amnesty period
for a lot of the more senior people in
that organization to come forward
because what you don&#39;t want to get into
is into a open conflict
um I mean violent conflict because as
Admiral Wilson who I briefed back in the
90s said once he had it confirmed to him
that what the best
aircraft and weapon he knew we had were
what everyone knows about in the B2
stealth bomber Etc and that this secret
organization had things that could quote
as he said to me do circles around my B2
stealth so and now this is the head of
the intelligence for The Joint Chiefs of
Staff and Admiral sitting in his office
and I looked at him and I said yes that
is the case but the problem is we have
the rule of law and the truth and if we
can disclose this properly the public on
our side and they have their covert
group and a lot of money but they do
have very powerful Technologies and I
think this is why it has to be done
wisely I found in my archive a few weeks
ago my original set of recommendations
to Bill Clinton to create an amnesty
period uh for senior people in this
organization to come forward so that
this issue could get resolved without as
one guy recently asked me a bloodbath
uh and I think that&#39;s really what we&#39;re
trying to move towards is a peaceful
resolution to the subject where we don&#39;t
go trying to get a pound of Flesh from
people
the other problem is restitution of
funds there&#39;s a senior executive with a
major contractor for the US government
who&#39;s now early 80s who wants to come
forward he has several hundred million
dollars
that he has he got by working with that
a corporation and he&#39;s afraid that it
could be seized under the RICO
racketeering influence corrupt
organization laws of the U.S government
and he doesn&#39;t want his heirs his
children and grandchildren to be left
penniless so there are a lot of complex
issues here and people go gee you know
so these are the kind of conversations
I&#39;m having with the one side people who
want to be cooperating Witnesses and
then you have this other uh end of it
where the United States government is
just now getting up to speed on this at
all and therefore don&#39;t have a mechanism
and the laws in place to make this
transition to disclosure complete
disclosure uh an official disclosure
happened peacefully so that is another
thing we&#39;re working on
you know you&#39;re also working with
Michael schrat
um military Aerospace historian he&#39;s
been collecting the files and both of
you will be presenting over there at the
national Press Club
in June 12th over there at DC
massive amounts of information Let&#39;s uh
take a quick look at again at UFO end
game with Michael schrat as he discusses
the crash retrieval situation
Dr Greer had talked about and he wrote a
white paper that discusses this if
you&#39;ve got a classified program you&#39;ve
got a usap program unacknowledged
special Access program so from the very
get-go if this is contrary to the
Constitution at the very beginning then
the entire program goes against the law
so they&#39;re not bound to their National
Security deals because it&#39;s extra
constitutional from the very get-go so
you can see the Way Greer has played
this is very masterful it&#39;s very genius
so not necessarily are all these people
under this umbrella of secrecy if the
entire program is extra constitutional
from the very beginning and so it&#39;s a
very good play that we can capitalize on
and it might be a wedge to get in there
so that some of these programs can be
Declassified
all right we&#39;re back and again working
with Michael schrett he&#39;s been doing
this for decades you&#39;ve teamed up with
Michael to present some evidence over
there in DC at the national Press Club
something historic which was at one of
the biggest internet phenomenons when he
when he did it in the early 2000s and
you know hundreds of millions of people
saw this what what are we going to
expect to see in DC when uh you&#39;re
presenting this evidence you got
terabytes of information is what&#39;s the
end game here
well obviously when you have two hours
and you have if it was continuously
presented
the information we have the testimony we
have the documents we have with last
probably three to four years I&#39;m not
exaggerating so the Big Challenge we&#39;re
having is what is the very tip of the
iceberg that can be that we need to
present to give a sense of the scope of
the evidence and the uh for example out
of the 800 or so top secret military
Witnesses and uh folks that we&#39;ve
identified and many of whom we&#39;ve
already I&#39;ve interviewed
some of them have already been recorded
some are now just now this literally
this month being brought to DC to give
their information through this
classified process
how do you present that in two hours
you know how what what do you present
you have to understand you&#39;re not
talking to you know the mashed potato
UFO circuit where people are you know
conference people who go to UFO things
day in and day out year in and year out
and know the subject you&#39;re talking to
the general public you&#39;re talking to the
people in the U.S government
99.9 of whom have no information on this
so you have to start you have to build
your case from zero and then take them
all the way through to the conclusions
but also and the assessment the
intelligence assessment but then the
recommendations what do we do now
so all of that has to be presented and
done concisely in less than two hours so
that now that&#39;s why the conference
beforehand
uh it&#39;s open to the public until it&#39;s
sold out I encourage people to come to
that if you can&#39;t be there in person
which would really be the most fun uh
you can come and see it via a webinar
stream we&#39;re going to stream the entire
three days Saturday Sunday and Monday at
the press conference but the two days at
the ameria beforehand that&#39;s going to be
open to the public to be there in person
but you can also see it from your home
anywhere in the world and I think the
reason we&#39;re doing that is we want as
many people as possible to participate
in it and then begin to light up the
system for the national Press Club event
whether they have contacts in the media
or they contact or a member or Congress
or they contact staffers they know uh
whoever it is and in other countries
let&#39;s remember the global phenomenon in
other countries they should do the same
thing with their country&#39;s leadership
members of parliament whatever it is
because ultimately this needs to be a
global disclosure movement it can&#39;t it
isn&#39;t just United States and there are
these other countries uh many of whom
I&#39;ve met with some of their leaders I&#39;ve
met with four of the five eyes the five
eyes are the the
intelligence cooperating countries of
you know United Kingdom Canada United
States Australia New Zealand I&#39;ve met
with Ministers of defense for all those
countries except New Zealand and what I
found is that in every single case
they were never read in or briefed on
the subject now this is an important
category of witnesses I call them
inverse Witnesses what do I mean by that
it&#39;s how you prove that these projects
are being run in a criminal manner
because if a president or a minister of
defense or a senior member of the Senate
intelligence committee or the head of
intelligence joint staff like Admiral
Wilson or the director of the defense
intelligence agency uh whom I&#39;ve briefed
and other people like that all over the
world
have not made
any inroads into getting into what&#39;s
going on in their countries or in the
United States that is prima facie proof
that the subject is being run illegally
because they can you know the one of the
things I just determined in 97 98 once
we found out that the Clinton
Administration and a friend of his just
recently confirmed this to me was never
read into this where they had any
control over the matter and that you so
if you go from the president on down and
even through the military chain of
command where there are people who if
the projects were being run legally the
people managing the black budget in the
congress the people in the Pentagon read
into unacknowledged projects uh like
Admiral Wilson they would know about
this and if they inquired about it they
wouldn&#39;t be threatened they would be
read in but that&#39;s not how this is run
and that is proof that the organization
is in fact a criminal Opera operation
unconstitutional and illegal we have to
establish these elements because now
that the Pentagon has said yes the uaps
are real yes they&#39;re material objects
yes our sensors pick up that it&#39;s an
actual 3D thing moving in ways we don&#39;t
understand blah blah then the next
question is what are they now what
they&#39;re being told by professional
counterintelligence operatives such as
Luis Elizondo and Chris Mellon and Nick
Pope and others is that we don&#39;t know
what they are and but they&#39;re a threat
to the National Security
that false narrative which we exposed
two years ago in our documentary The
Cosmic hoax but you can see on the
YouTube channel for free
uh that is the narrative that they
created as another way of deceiving to
press the American people and the
members of Congress but see that that
little game ended about 14 months ago so
now there are people in the Congress
some are beginning to speak out publicly
uh and kudos to them uh like like
Congressman Burchette we have I just got
a letter with 16 senior members of the
U.S Senate signing a letter to the
Pentagon to step up their investigation
on this issue unfortunately they&#39;re
recommending it through the arrow office
which in my opinion uh may or may not be
an actual clean or or trustworthy
mechanism but at least the members of
Congress the Senate and House are
stepping up and are stepping forward
very decisively
hey they&#39;re asking questions and again
Tim burchett the speaks of a major
cover-up he he agrees with you that
there is some kind of uh secret being
hidden from us and it&#39;s on a high level
of secrecy and he&#39;s demanding the truth
and he says there&#39;s this black male
politics going on with people that have
answers but they&#39;re not going to come
forward because they usually got
something on them this is how he says
Washington works of course do we exactly
do we need more uh Tim Burton&#39;s out
there how many other congressmen are uh
uh being as um dare I say ballsy is uh
Congressman Tim burchett coming forward
and asking questions or all these other
go ahead well there there have been else
he&#39;s been very outspoken but you know
Senator Rubio&#39;s been made some very
strong comments there are other members
of Congress and Senate who have
bit milder perhaps in their approach
but I think there are don&#39;t mistake
what&#39;s said publicly with what they feel
is going on but the point you make about
uh using blackmail files this is as old
as the hills where you get try to get
dirt on someone and use it against them
uh and of course you know famously Jager
Hoover had a file on everybody every
president every Congressman everybody
everybody everybody
and that&#39;s how he stayed in in power was
that he&#39;d no one dared challenge him
because he could ruin them with all the
dirty tricks and and stuff they had on
people so yes that is something that
happens day in and day out and day in
and day out
um and so what I always tell people is
that
so what you just have to ignore that
noise but if you&#39;re a politician and you
have to get reelected you can&#39;t ignore
it and so this does become a problem but
there too
one of the things we&#39;re going to call
for and I have not talked about this
before is that there be an immediate
investigation criminal investigation
subsequent to these open hearings that
are being now talked about actually
occurring by the Department of Justice
to prosecute those who have been
involved in
felonious activity drug running money
laundering uh threats and intimidation
assassinations uh so-called Wet Works of
the use of force to kill people who know
too much all of that needs to be moved
quickly into an investigation because I
have dealt just recently with two very
key top secret Witnesses who have been
had this sort of a dirty trick bag of
tricks played on them remember at this
time also with AI
and what they call Deep fakes
um both audio and video deep fakes they
can create anything a man that I know
not long ago in the last
nine months
had a couple of men approach him and
they said look at your phone and on his
phone
they had put horrible things on it and
said to him you either keep your mouth
shut
or you&#39;re going to go to prison and
never see your your children again for
as long as you live quote unquote this
is the kind of stuff I deal with day in
and day out now I think something like
that should be immediately handed over
to people with the investigatory power
and prosecutorial power that whoever did
that should be arrested and tried for
treason number one and then number two
uh felonious threats and intimidation
and what have you but see this is the
sort of thing that has happened for
years is there people who have
documented over the last 70 years many
occasions of this happening to either
public officials UFO researchers or
whatever now with the kind of technology
that is exists
you know they could they could show you
uh you know having an affair with uh Kim
Kardashian or whoever and make it look
like it was a hundred percent real uh
and this is the problem they have the
Technologies and the means and the
intent to do this so how do you how do
you get that under control again the you
have to begin to stay not only within
the law but use the power of the law to
protect the Brave and good people who
want to come forward whether it&#39;s a
member of Congress wanting to support
this process or a top secret
whistleblower or whoever it is and I
think that that is a really important
element that&#39;s been missing we&#39;ve all
been doing this in the wilderness
without any official protection which is
in and of itself an outrageous situation
so that has to also I think be put into
place sooner rather than later
speaking of the AI and the advancement
of it it&#39;s just it&#39;s been unloaded to
the public people are using it kids are
using it chat gbt passing uh their
courses but a whole new level is the AI
as far as uh generating people and uh
situation how far Advanced is this going
to get is this going to be a tool for
the false flag Alien Invasion when they
uh set this AI in motion with these
Graphics that seem photorealistic that
we won&#39;t be able to tell whether it&#39;s
real or not this is getting to a to a
stage no it already is it already is
here&#39;s your question for guess one key
point
whatever you know about
through
a Google search or that&#39;s on CNN or in
the economist or some magazine
is at least five to twenty Generations
behind what these covert programs have
so if you think the state of the art of
this capability is what you&#39;re hearing
and reading about uh you need to take a
wake-up pill because that is not how
technology happens these classified
projects uh have Technologies way in
advance of anything that is known and
discussed uh in the tech sector or in
the public media and this is is a
dangerous situation this is why the man
who in 1997 that we&#39;re trying to track
him down again
who was sequestered out of the briefings
we were doing for members of Congress at
that time in Washington he had been on
an interagency Committee in 1974 where
they could hit a button
and simulate an alien invasion on the
planet seamlessly and he said everyone
from the president on down would be
deceived by it so that system has been
fully operational he said it was fully
operational well before his tenure there
now I have heard this from enough people
to know that that capability can that
card the sort of the fake Alien Invasion
card can be played at any time now what
most people don&#39;t understand
uh is that that card began to be played
in 1953 and 1954. what do I mean once we
mastered gravity control in 1954 and be
they knew they were about there in 53.
we have a document from the CIA director
talking about the psychological warfare
value of the UFO subject the same
language was used in the document that
Jacques Raleigh has but won&#39;t release
that is a CIA document from 1985 that
explicitly talks about the CIA
committing atrocities in Latin America
and Brazil and Argentina staging alien
abductions for their quote psychological
warfare value
Etc and so on now we have multiple data
points on this now one of the things the
public has to understand is that
everyone&#39;s belief about this issue
aliens UFOs the whole zeitgeist
it&#39;s 90 staged deception
now there are there actually
extraterrestrial civilizations yes have
they been engaged in those sort of
activities no we know for a fact these
abductions and mutilations are done by
the this clandestine organization uh and
there&#39;s growing body of evidence for
that but the problem is is that when
people talk about when will this false
flag happen I said uh look in your rear
view mirror 70 years that&#39;s when it
started it started 70 years ago now
we&#39;re living in that&#39;s called the
psychological Preparatory phase the
question is when do will they play that
final card
and if they do what are our defenses I
think our only way we can prevent that
car from being played is to expose the
entire program expose what they&#39;ve been
doing how they&#39;ve been doing it what
part of this is true what part is false
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that
about the time we were working on
together on your film and I had gotten
the senior members of the government
read into
these projects and they started getting
doors entering kicking indoors
that the Pentagon recede from Dr kit
green at tall
and release 1500 pages of accounts of
people being quote injured by uaps
unwanted pregnancies neurological damage
Burns now every single one of those
cases were done by humans against humans
made to look like it was a quote UFO
well it was a UFO in the sense that the
victim did it was unidentified but they
staged it to look alien so they&#39;ve
already started playing that card but
every no one&#39;s watching this no one&#39;s
paying attention to what&#39;s going on so
when that got released I went yep here
we go
then after I brought the first senior
military witness who had been a early U2
spy plane pilot
with multiple encounters with these ET
craft as well as working with the
Lockheed Skunk Works and others
and been Rich personally
into this process in DC
you had all the February light up with
these Chinese balloons and uaps we shot
down so you know this is this is no
coincidence my friend but at the same
time this we expect this this is not so
surprising to us at all
um it would be surprising if they didn&#39;t
do it so we have factoring all this in
our algorithm and planning but the
public needs to be aware that the more
this process of the subject coming out
happens the more there&#39;s going to be a
counter push to pull it into
were being invaded they&#39;re a threat to
the National Security we need an extra
10 trillion dollars from the world
economy to fight the big bad aliens
invading us I mean that&#39;s what the game
has always been this is what Werner Von
Brown said on his deathbed to Carol
rosin we know this so the the issue is
how do we avert it well I think the
disclosure of the truth and proving what
we&#39;re discussing here and having a full
investigation and you can&#39;t do that in a
two-hour press conference having a full
investigation an open hearing and then
the Department of Justice with someone
who&#39;s a clean investigator if you can
find one in Washington
uh really drill down on this but they&#39;d
have to be Beyond reproach they couldn&#39;t
be someone who could be blackmailed or
bought off
I mean let&#39;s not forget a senior member
of the the private Contracting World on
UFOs in 93 told me quote we have given
at least 10 000 people 10 million
dollars a piece or more to secure their
cooperation with our project
and you know I had had two or three
attempts to purchase me back in those
days and they found out I wasn&#39;t for
sale
so now they&#39;re the only way they can
deal with me is that to fame me and call
me names and it&#39;s fine I mean your 30
years of being called every nasty name
in the book I couldn&#39;t care less but you
get a pretty thick skin but the point
I&#39;m making however is that most people
just now stepping onto the field
who if you&#39;re in the U.S government and
you&#39;re either threatened
or you&#39;re you know there&#39;s this nasty
Opera research they have on you or that
they create
or they offer you a lot of money or a
powerful position
unfortunately most humans are going to
be affected by that kind of approach and
this is why to really get to this I
always tell people the bottom line on
this is what&#39;s in your heart what are
your intentions do you have the courage
to go forward and are you Incorruptible
you have to be absolutely incorruptible
you know it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing people are
waking up we&#39;re making these
documentaries you&#39;re making
documentaries you got another one uh
coming up
in a in June it&#39;ll be the biggest one
it&#39;s called The Lost century and how to
reclaim it go to the Lost
centuryfilm.com
uh you can see what we&#39;re doing uh it&#39;s
been finished it&#39;s delivered to the
distributor it&#39;s going to drop June 6th
so here&#39;s the timing the Lost century
and how to reclaim it that is an expose
of all these covert Technologies free
energy Zero Point Energy anti-gravity
that comes out June 6th the conference
in Washington is on a June 10th and 11th
and the national Press Club event is on
June 12th so that&#39;s going to be a very
momentous week
absolutely and then UFO end game to
disclosure is still the top documentary
on iTunes Amazon it&#39;s been rolling for
about three weeks and people are turning
out actually we just dropped the price
uh for rental so people could go watch
it at a lower price versus purchasing
the documentary but again making the
number one spot on Amazon iTunes all
Grassroots no no advertising people just
want to get out there and it&#39;s all word
of mouth because these are the biggest
questions
that people want to get answers to and
that&#39;s what we&#39;re we&#39;re here for we&#39;re
we&#39;re trying to break it wide open and
again it has to be yeah thank you every
everyone liked it who saw it I mean I
just want people to know I I&#39;m not the
producer on that I was interviewed but
um I I think everyone I know who&#39;s seen
has loved it and people thought it was
very well done
hard-hitting and it&#39;s a good compliment
to the other body of work we have I
think that uh the reason we&#39;re releasing
the Lost Century now is that most people
now who follow the news at all on this
subject know that the UFOs are real the
Pentagon has said they&#39;re real
there&#39;s a process to investigate them
even though it&#39;s been diverted in a
number of directions with that Aero
office where you know the people heading
that up either don&#39;t know anything
relevant about the subject or they are
pretending not to know but nevertheless
uh now the question has to be answered
why you know when I first got on the
stage doing this as an emergency doctor
and I&#39;m briefing the director of the CIA
he did not need to be convinced that the
UFOs were real he didn&#39;t understand why
he and the president were being denied
access and what was so important that
the president and he and other senior
people in the cabinet including the
Secretary of Defense were being denied
access
and I had to explain
it isn&#39;t because of little green or gray
men it&#39;s because the Technologies behind
how those things move
uh haven&#39;t studied figured out made
fully operational and reverse engineered
since the 1950s which means it&#39;s the end
of oil gas coal nuclear power surface
roads Public Utilities shall I continue
now what does that mean it means that
the quadrillion of hundreds of trillions
of dollars in assets linked to that part
of the industrial base of the economy
will have to be retired and transition
to an entirely new macro economic and
social system that doesn&#39;t uh uh
relegate uh
to a very small number massively wealthy
industrial folks the control over the
whole global economy
and so this is something that people in
with enormous wealth and power do not
want to see happen now that&#39;s why it&#39;s
been stalled this is why Eisenhower lost
control of these projects in the 50s
it&#39;s why General Patton was killed made
to look like an automobile wreck
um because people who are advocating for
this coming out were hit butting heads
with some of the most impowerful fascist
industrial uh people uh in the world
that are at the backbone of the entire
modern industrial economy so these sort
of issues and it&#39;s not just us it&#39;s
Global uh is really important I mean you
know the entire U.S federal budget five
six trillion dollars a year which is as
massive as that sounds is a rounding
error compared to the assets and revenue
of the industries and the parts of the
financial system related to what I just
described in the energy propulsion
utility sector so the the the power
isn&#39;t in the US government the power is
beyond it above it within it hidden
to most people who are elected to the
office slowly they&#39;re waking up to this
but it I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s not a day late
and a dollar short or you know a
quadrillion dollars short uh we have
known this I&#39;ve known this since the
early 90s now this is the big question
it has we have to begin to answer I
don&#39;t think we need to you know the UFO
subculture needs to understand that the
situation at this point is put forward
the most this positive evidence you have
and I would recommend anybody in
possession of government documents pilot
cases ce2 cases where it&#39;s left physical
evidence anyone who&#39;s a military
whistleblower or government contractor
who wants to come forward either
secretively or publicly they need to
contact me at info at
seriousdisclosure.com
s-i-r-i-u-s-disclosure.com if you have
that kind of material we need it
immediately if you&#39;re that kind of
witness we need to be in touch
immediately
and in particular if you&#39;re willing to
come out publicly which I know for many
people is scary but remember we already
have some 70 disclosure process project
witnesses that have come forward since
2001 and none of them have been
threatened none of them have been killed
none of them have had anything bad
happen to them so I tell people we beta
tested the system uh we need a lot of
people to come forward I was on a Navy
SEAL show uh about a month and a half
ago called the Sean Ryan Show and uh he
was wonderful and it&#39;s a whole group of
Navy SEALs who are supportive and
protecting us also and what I tell
people is that
from that a network is growing of people
who have been Delta Force Navy SEAL
military who are stepping out of the
Shadows but we need that to become an
avalanche of people because we need that
Dam to burst because there are thousands
and thousands and thousands of people
who&#39;ve been involved at one level or
another in these projects over the
decades and so we need those people to
come forward now there&#39;s a legal
mechanism for them to testify and give
their information to these investigators
and these oversight committees in the
Congress where they&#39;re protected legally
and so I&#39;d say the doors open let&#39;s move
through it before something happens
where they slam it shut you know my
concern is after we did the national
Press Club event in 2001
May 9th
if four months later we had 9 11. and so
you know world events can evolve that
didn&#39;t overtake the momentum of
something like this whether planned or
unplanned you can make your own
conclusions but we need to move
expeditiously now that the store is open
it&#39;s a mind-blowing situation
for the public it&#39;s like oh a conspiracy
theory it&#39;s entertaining but if you&#39;re
actually in a responsible position and
you find out that there&#39;s a whole secret
government program that you don&#39;t know
about it&#39;s a shock
from a shadowy pentagon Department that
was shut down in 2012 the disclosure
movement has been hijacked by people
comparing the narrative in the script
being written by these black projects I
would say 90 plus percent of everything
that&#39;s going to come out is false
the most widely seen qfo right now is
not alien it&#39;s actually ours
so it&#39;s a great cover story for all
kinds of criminal activities blame it on
the aliens right
if we were being visited by
interdimensional beans we should know
about it
this has the big disadvantage of the
truth being much more unbelievable
than the fiction it&#39;s the crash
retrievals that are the Rosetta Stone
for solving the UFO cover-up
the implications of this is the
difference between extinction level
civilization versus one that&#39;s going to
take off to the Stars
oh
absolutely it&#39;s a buckle up time you
know UFO end games out and uh you know
you got the Lost Century coming up the
national Press Club it&#39;s all happening
and we&#39;re going to be the links are uh
in the description below so you could uh
take a look at all the events coming up
take a look at the documentaries I know
uh we&#39;re just about out of time here
like receiving career but you know the
the end game is disclosure and you know
free energy at this point and change the
world and have a paradigm shift and I
think we&#39;re on the right path but again
you just never know what&#39;s going to
happen so people do have to come forward
while the timing is right and uh you
know it&#39;s going to be it&#39;s going to be
an amazing year this year and what&#39;s
happening with the Congress and maybe
more hearings we&#39;ll see what happens but
you know things are moving forward in a
positive direction and with people and
whistleblowers that are out there that
are willing to put
their life on the line right and then it
does take courage but I actually don&#39;t
think anyone&#39;s going to be harmed you
know that what we
you&#39;re talking to the canary in the mine
shaft here because I&#39;m the person the
head person bringing these people into
DC and organizing and pushing on this
issue for 30 years so
you know luckily they don&#39;t wet work me
and kill me you know I have plans if
they do they&#39;re going to be very very
sorry they did
um which I won&#39;t talk about but I will
say that I&#39;m more dangerous dead than
alive
So and I&#39;ve made that to an extension to
anyone who&#39;s a cooperating person
whether they&#39;re in the government or one
of these military Witnesses so it&#39;s the
best we can do until there&#39;s a more
official process that exists and I think
we&#39;re gonna you were just seeing the
beginning of this process but time isn&#39;t
on our side one of the things I&#39;ve said
to these senior people in Washington is
that
I know the US government moves at the
speed of molasses in Vermont
uh however
uh we really really need to pick up the
pace because and I think there are
members of Congress who sense this uh
some of the ones I&#39;ve met with have a
clear sense that once you start down
this path it&#39;s not a good idea to dither
because your adversaries here who are
running these criminal operations
they uh they have all manner of
contingencies and buttons they can push
so I think it would behoove us to move
quickly this is why I&#39;m making this
urgent appeal for whistleblowers and
people with evidence now let me make
this very clear if you have material
evidence physical evidence of a craft
photos
documents even if they&#39;re highly
classified
those should all come to us and we can
get them to the right people remember we
declare these projects dealing with this
issue
unconstitutional and illegal in 1997 and
98 that the legal position has never
been challenged even though it was the
entire US government was notified of
this uh the disclosure project was a
test case for that because we released
people with top secret clearances and
and and documents as well as documents
that were not Declassified that were top
secret if you look at the unacknowledged
book
um now what does that mean has anyone
had anyone push back on them no because
no one will ever be able to uh win a
legal battle of or against us on this
assertion that these projects are
illegal and that&#39;s why I call these
inverse Witnesses these senior members
of the government who could discipline
it who have been denied access to this
information
those are your main uh people who would
testify if this ever came to that
because they would be able to say yeah I
was the president yep I was the
Secretary of Defense yep I was chairman
of this Committee in the senate or house
uh and this goes way back way back when
Congressman Dan Burton who issued a
subpoenas against the clintons and the
house government oversight committee
back in the 90s when we met with him and
he came to our 1997 briefings for
congress he said
I&#39;ve never been read into this and
anything we ask about it we&#39;re brushed
aside so this I can there is a long
documented history we have approving
that these projects are being run
illegally without legal oversight of the
president the executive branch or the
course or the Congress therefore it is
by definition Rogue and that&#39;s why I
tell people you should have you should
know that even though when you were
working at the Skunk Works or you were
working on the delta forces or or Navy
SEAL at a facility or an operation you
may not have known that the chain of
command
way up there was operating illegally but
now you do and therefore knowing that
you should feel very encouraged to come
forward
and it doesn&#39;t matter if you sign an
80-year non-disclosure agreement which
some of our guys have eight years and
way past their natural lifespan I said
that&#39;s already been that&#39;s been waived
and we now have a process you can even
if you have these non-disclosure
agreements and security host you can
provide your testimony and so I think
it&#39;s very important that as a civic duty
and a service to humanity people
come forward very quickly now
you know Now&#39;s the Time and you&#39;ve been
doing your work Dr Graham this year it&#39;s
going to be like you say explosive the
information that&#39;s going to be coming
out and the call uh to people to come
forward with the evidence again be safe
over there we&#39;ll see you in Washington
in uh June National Press Club and uh
the Lost Century it&#39;s all going to be
there and it&#39;s going to be straining
live on your channel the national Press
Club you&#39;re putting it out for free this
is this is what it&#39;s all there&#39;s going
to be a bunch of people streaming and
it&#39;ll be the whole National Press Club
event will be free to the world uh and
actually you can come to it personally
if you&#39;re in town for the conference uh
and be there in person it&#39;s going to be
phenomenal uh but yes the entire world
will be able to see this in real time
and when you start seeing what&#39;s in the
archive I&#39;m going to have streaming
behind me
uh whatever 80 90 pages of uh top secret
Witnesses names will be redacted but
what they&#39;re going to just streaming
behind me
you know 800 of them
something not to be missed oh yeah and
remember all of that has been handed off
to the investigators in the U.S
government all of it
everybody&#39;s going to have what you have
basically and you&#39;re just putting it out
there you&#39;ve been archiving it you&#39;ve
been working this uh for so long and
you&#39;re just gonna give it to the people
and let them see what you got well we
need help you know but this archive
project
we need a lot of people helping us with
it we also need funding here&#39;s an appeal
I estimate in the next
in this calendar year 2023 we will have
to spend at least 250 000 to 300 000 to
get all that material indexed organized
data fi based created uh and all the
other things that go along with it
um never mind building a website and
putting it out to the public so that
ain&#39;t going to be done by June but what
I&#39;m saying is that that&#39;s what we want
to do but it&#39;s you know I mean we&#39;re
we&#39;re a public interest group we&#39;re not
being funded by the Ford foundation so
we need people to contribute also to
that if you can
absolutely again all the contact links
is in the description below uh Dr Steven
Greer appreciate it and uh looking
forward to seeing you in Washington be
safe and everybody out there be safe as
well we&#39;ll see you see you soon thank
you
if we were being visited by
interdimensional beans we should know
about it
this has the big disadvantage of the
truth being much more unbelievable
than the fiction it&#39;s the crash
retrievals that are the Rosetta Stone
for solving the UFO cover-up
the implications of this is the
difference between extinction level
civilization versus one that&#39;s going to
take off to the Stars
oh wow
foreign
