 This journal was the product of the Federatie van Vrije Religieuze Groepen en Organisaties (Federation of Free Religious Groups and Organizations) formed in Amsterdam in 1919.  The group’s unifying principles were the rejection of established, dogmatic religious organizations in favor of "Free" religion and a vague, hopeful belief in something beyond the ordinary, materialistic experience of daily life. Within those broad bounds the Free Religious Groups encompassed various liberal Christian organizations, spiritualists/spiritists, including the Spiritist Brotherhood "Harmonia" that published Toekomstig Leven, irregular Freemasons, and Theosophists.  This last group, as Alexandra Nagel has shown in her "The Association of Jewish Theosophists in the Netherlands" (Correspondences 7, no. 2, 1919) notably centered around Jewish Theosophists who were active in both Free Religion and the Krishnamurti-focused Star in the East. The journal’s interests, announced in its subtitle, were all-encompassing.  It described itself as:

 A Magazine Devoted to Free Religious Movements: Liberal Religion, Eastern and Western Religion, Occultism, Spiritism, Theosophy, Astrology, Kabbalah, Freemasonry, Anthroposophy, Rosicrucian Cosmology, Mysticism, Psychical Research, Science, Architecture, Art, Religion and Philosophy

 With these goals in mind, the journal published a hodgepodge of articles, all clear, rational and polite and without conviction or passion, on subjects like "Esoteric Catholicism," "Ethical Pantheism," "Religious Materialism," "Inner Cosmology," "Immanuel Kant," "Psychical Research," the internecine squablings of the Theosophists, "The Krishnamurti Drama," "The Riddle of Man," "The Future of Astrology," "Psychometry, Clairvoyance and Future Predictions," "Nirvana," "Earth Magnetism and Spiritual Magnetism," "Augustine’s Superstitions," "The Ghost Belief of Primitive Peoples," "Why I am a Rosicrucian" (Max Heindel), "The School of Emile Coue in Nancy," "Revelations about Atlantis," "The Astral and the Fourth Dimension," etc.  The journal also carried regular book reviews, original poetry, and a musical column.
