HOW TO PERFORM
MIND ·READING ACT NO. 1
This Act is best performed by using a double
envefope. This can be made by glueing together
the address sides of two ordinary envelopes, which
leaves the flaps on the outside. Care should be
taken to see that the edges fit in close and are even
withcittt any ·gaping, so as to avoid detgction by the
audience. ·'
,Before the show, the Professor and the Medium
place a coin on one ·side of each double envelope
and seal it. The denomination of the coin and the
dates they bear are noted by both performers.
For convenience and to avoid confusion, during
the performance of the Act, each envelope should
be given a number.
When the time arrives for the performance of
this Act, the professor passes into the audience
with the envelopes, and without announcing what '
he intends doing, borrows a coin fro~· some spec-
tator. Before accepting the coin, the Professor
proves the envelope is empty by turning it ¥Pside
down, spreading apart the folds and shaking it,
Then the spectator is asked to drop the coin into
the envelope and the Professor seals it. (The
object of not mentioning what he is about to do,
is to prevent the audience from looking at the
dates on any coins they have before the Professor
gets them.) It is understood, of course, that the
coin the professor borrows, is of the same denomina-
tion as the coin already in on· the other side of the
.envelope. Hav~g thus disposed of envelope No.
1, he proceeds in the same manner to secure coins
for envelopes Nos. 2, 3, 4 and so on, until he has
filled all the enve!Opes.
The Professor then returns to the stage. He
usually gives a little ·talk of a comic nature and
somewhat. shrouded in mystery about the superior
mind-reading powers of the Medium. Then it is
2 5 MIND READING ACTS EXPOSED
that he announces for the fir.st time, his object in
borrowing the coins from the audience. He asks
that everyone be as quiet as possible while the
Medium performs the most delicate task;
Holding up envelope No. 1, he asks the Medium
tite denomination of the coin in that envelepe.
W_
hen the r edium answers, he asks for the date
on the coiilj. Upon receiv-ing this information, the
Professor repeats the date in a loud voice so that
all may be assured of hearing the date.
,Going to the spectator from whom he b.orrowed
the first coin, he cuts open envelope No. 1, and
hands the. coin to its owner, asking him to verify
the date on the coin. Of course the date given by
the Medium is correct, because the Professor cuts
open the side of tke double envelope in which he
'and the Medium placed the coin before the show.
The spectator does not get his own coin back, but
one of the same denomination. Tne same procedure
takes place as regards envelopes Nos. 2, 3, 4, and
so on.
The Medium should always be blindfolded dur-
ing the entire performance of this Act as this adds
to the effect produced.
By using the double envelope, this Act can be
performed in parlors, at picnics, dinners, etc.
MIND READING ACT NO. 2
The ·Professor announces to the audience that
the Medium will now tell them what they are
1 thi~king about. He passes among them and dis-
tributes pieces of paper upon which they are asked
to write a message or ask a question, and sign
their names.
Later, he .collects these messages in a bag having
two chambers, only one of which is shown. Going
upon the stage, the Professor empties the contents
of the ]:>ag upon the. floor, but these contents are
fake papers having been placed in the secret cham-
ber of the bag before the show; however from the
viewpoint of the audience, these papers bear the
messages they just wrote. He then thr'ows the
bag off the stage.
The Professtir borrows a hat from someone in
the audience and places the fake messages in it,
or he may stick a match to them and completely
burn them up on the stage in full .view of the.
spectators. .
He immediately asks the Medium to read the
·messages4he audience wrote, and tell them who the
author is in each case. This the Medim;n does at
once much to the surprise of the awe-inspired and
mystery-stricken crowd.
When the bag is tossed from the stage, an assis-
tant immediately ~akes it behind the curtain close
to where the Medium is seated, empties it, and when
ready whispers the first message to the Medium
and names the author. The Medium in turn an-
nounces it, pretending to read the message by
mental telepathy.
If a question is asked, it may be answered, if
the Medium knows how, if not, then it may be
passed up and another selected which is easier.
As there would be quite a number of messages to
read, it would be simple enough to pass up the un-
desirable ones, and. when ready to quit, any mes-
4 5 MIND READING ACTS EXPOSED
sages not read may be excused from being read <;>n
a<:count of the limit of.time.
When the assistant reads a message in the form
of a question which he cannot answer, the Medium
can express his refusal ·by clearing his throat,
coughing, or by any sign agreed upon. This gives
the assistant notice that it is not wanted, and he
can at once tead another without taking up too
much time between readings.
Some times this trick is performed by having
those of the audience writing messages seal them
in an envelope supplied them. Then, although the
bag secret would be handled the same, instead of
burning the sealed envelopes, they would be handed
to the Medium, still seated (that is, the fake ones)
which he would hold close to his forehead and pre-
tend to draw out the messages by his previously
described super..natural mind.
To make the act more effective, and if the show
continues for another day or more at the same
place, the Professor might request some of the
audience, or their friends, to go together and w.rite
a message and sign it and·bring it with them when
they. come to the show the following evening, when
the Medium would tell them what they wiU have
written and who all signed it. ·
It is aways best that the Medium be blindfolded
during the entire performance of this Act.
,
MIND READING ACT NO. 3
Five or six weeks before the date for which the
show is billed, the Professor sends a representative
to the manager of the theater ·at which the show
is to be held. The manager of the theater gives
the representative the names and addresses of pa-
trons more or less prominent who are known to
attend this particular theatre somewhat frequently.
These patrons the representative interviews. He
usually poses as a representative of some publishing
company gatltering data for statistical purposes or
for some book under publication. He carries ere-
• dentials from this publishing house which he never
fails to show. These credentials help suppress clues
:which the patron later on may surmise.
The representative then produces a questionnaire.
However, before going ahead with the questions, he
submits three souvenirs of meritorious value, the
choice of which he offers the patron for giving him
the information about to be asked of him. This
ingratiates the representative with the patron and
places him in a more favorable position for securing
all the facts he solicits.
The representative refers to the questionnaire
and proceeds to collect the information desired.
This would include the patron's name, street num-
ber, phone ·number, date of birth, whether married
or single, and if married, wife's name, date of her
birth, information about their children, if any, his
weight, size of his shoes, collars, shirt, hat, etc.,
and any number of other things which it is desired
to know. -
. Any information concerning a va·cat1on trip,
either taken or about to be taken, has no place on
the questionnaire. This information must be gath-
ered diplomatically by the representative after
gathering all the other facts. For instance, if the
vacation period is approaching, the representative
may ask, "Have you had your :vacation yet,
1
Mr.
.. ,
6 5 MIND READING ACTS EXPOSED
Brown?" or "Thinking about vacation yet?" when
he is putting his questionnaire into his briefcase.
This introduces the subject, and then the field is
wide open for gathering all the oddities about a
trip.
.These questionnaires are either left with the
theater manager or sent to the Professor to look
over. The manager .of the theater is instructed how
to proceed further. Usually, just a few days before
the show, the manager of the theater·sends out let-
ters calling these patrons' attention to the splendid
entertainment about to arrive, and encloses compli-
mentary tickets good for a certain day only. In
nearly every case, the patron will attend on the
date for which their tickets are good.
When the Professor and Medium reach the city
they immediately go over the questionnaires, if they
have not·been sent to them, and gather the informa-
tion in a systematic manner. In case there is much
to remember, and there is danger of becoming con-
fused when performing the Act, the Medium writes
the facts on miniature cards, one card being used
for each patron.
When the time arrives for the patrons previously
interviewed to appear at the theater on the date for
which the tickets are good, so~e oNe of the theater,
who knows these patrons at sight, m.atches for them
and when they arrive, takes note of the fact and
locates them in the audience, unless the complimen-
tarY. tickets entitles them to numbered seats, in
which case their location in the theater would be
known. This information is given the Professor
and Medium, who then know that these patrons,
or some of them are in attendance.
The time having arrived for the performance of
this Act, the Professor appears on the stage with
the Medium, who is blindfolded, and announces the
nature of the Act. The Professer then steps into
the audience~ lo~ks around, locates one of the pa-
trons, who, before the show has been pointed out
to him by someone of the theatre who knows him,
and previously interviewed by the representative,
and either describes the patron or merely lays his
S MIND READING ACTS EXPOSED 1
hand on him, and asks the Medium to tell his name.
The Medium pretends to receive the name by his
extraordinary psychic power, and announces it. The
Professor then asks the patron if it is correct. He
states that it is. The professor asks, "Where does
this man live?" The Medium answers. Then fol-
lows all the other information it is desired to tell
about this particular patron.
The cards previously referred to may be held in
the hand oi.. the Medium and read when performing
the Act, by looking down under the blindfold with-
out being detected by the audience, as the Medium
is seated too far away for them to see the cards.
Or, if it is desired not to use the cards, the infor-
mation on the questionnaire can be whispered by
an assistant from behind the curtain to the Medium
who in turn gives it out to the audience. The ar-
rangement of the cards before the show starts
woula correspond with the order in which the
patrons are seated. This would prevent errors and
avoid confusion.
Many variations are used by the Medium in an-
swering questions and giving.out information, and
they must be used to make the Act a success and
more mystifying. Not always the same kind of
information is given about each one. At times dur-
ing the act, the Medium complains about the patron
not concentrating strongly enough and then pres-
ently exclaims, "Oh, yes, :sow I get the sensation;
that's wonderful. Your whole life unfolds like a
picture to me," and then continues giving out in- .
formation about the patron.
Many times confederates are used who travel
with the show. Of course, these people being
strangers to the audience, their history would be
unknown to all. , It is-possible for the Medium, in ·
a case of this kind, to liven up the audience, by tel-
ling some very unusual events. about the confed-
erate's life, and especially something quite comic.
The confederate would appear embarrassed, but
would admit the facts revealed by the Medium. . ,
Another method may be employed for giving out
the street number and occupation of any one living
8 5 MIND READING ACTS EXPOSED
in the city, but it is limited to these two things.
Without any pre-arrangement whatever as concerns
·the patrons, the Professor goes among the audience,
and, laying his hand upon the shoulders of some
patron, asks his name, and then announces it to the
Medium. Then, the Erofessor asks, "Can you give
this man's street number and occupation?" to which
the Me.dium replies correctly.
This is done as follows: When the Professor
announces the name of the patron, an assistant,
hoiding a City Directory behind the curtain close
to where the Medium is seated, quickly turns to
the name and whispers the street number and occu-
·J>ati.on to the Medium, who in tum gives it out.
Delays in finding the names by the assistant can be
covered up by the Medium apparently struggling
by means of mental telepathy to accomplish the
result. The Medium ·explains, also, that some
names come to him easier than others.
The Medium and Professor must always be ·tact-
ful. Much practice is required to ·accomplish this
Act, and all.other Acts, smoothly. If anything does
not work out just as either performer expected it
to; they very cleverly pass it up, but do so in such
a .way that escapes detection.
r
MIND READING ACT NO.· 4
This Act may be performed in either of two ways,
or. by a combination of the two methods. In either
case the Medium is always blind~olded.
A certain outlined and memorize~ set of ques-
tions and answers may be used. For instance, as
the Professor passes am,ong the audience, he.
touches a "man,'' then a "woman," then a "boy,"
then a "girl,'' and in doing so asks the Medium
what it is he touches in each instance.
Question No. 1 always means a "man," No. 2,
a "woman,'' ·No. 3, a "boy," No. 4,. a "girl,' and so
on. This is the more elementary of the two me- ·
thods, and most iikely to be used by amateurs. Its
weakness lies in its easy' detection, especially if it
is performed at home, at parties, etc., where the
same order of the questions gives away the secret.
The better method to be used, and less liable of
detection, is what is known as the "coded system."
That is, the form in which a question is asked means
a certain thing. The following is an example :
Who is this?................ . .... A man
Who is that?......•••.••.•••.. A woman
Now who is this? ................. A boy
Now, who is that? ................ A girl
What is this?................~.... A hat
What is that?..•.••••.... A handkerchief
All right.........•.... .. .. Wrist watch
Ladies or Gents?.•.. Ladies' wrist watch
Gents or Ladies?...... Gents' wrist watch·

Come on ...... :........Man with glasses
•
10 5 MIND READING ACTS EXPOSED
Are you sure?.••••.. Woman with glasses
Let's stop ....•.••••.......... Man's n~se
Any number· of phrases and statements may ,be
used and all keyed to mean different objects. With
lots of practice, the Professor and Medium can ask
and answer questions for long periods of time.
·i, In the same way, numbers written on. a piece of
paper while the Medium is'blindfolded, can be told
by the Medium, by keying each of 1, 2, 3, etc., to
some word. When the words are spoken by the
Professor, the Medium identifies them w ith the
numbers they stand for, and tells what the number
is that has been written on the paper, slate or
·blackboard.
Sometimes a combination of both methods ren- J
ders the Act less liable to detection, and where you
are called upon to do the Act several times in suc-
cession, it is always be.st to employ both, by usfo.g
the method first described to begin with.
It is to be noted that this Act requires a good
memory, quickness of thought, plenty of practice,
and a steady nerve backed up with lots of confi-
dence in one's self to avoid errors and put it across.
'
HOW TO PERFORM THE
HOODOO ACT-A Honie Entertainer
With your friends seated around you, you sud-
denly arise and announce that you and (your as·
sistant's name) will now give them something to
think about.
You tell them that you are going outside the
house and ask them to na:me some object in the
room while you ai;e gone and when you return you
will tell them what it is. Tell them that you don't
care what the object is they name as you are not
in the least particular, but a very agreeable .and
accommodating sort of a fellow, and anything that
suits them, suits you. Let's assume a "dresser"
is named.
When you return, your assistant asks you if it
was such and such an object, and you, of course,
answer "No"·; then, after quizzing you closely for a
few minutes, your assistant settles down, and asks
you if it is a "dresser," and you answer "Yes."
Naturally, your friends will want you to do it again,
and when you do, you will be surprised at the num-
ber of solutions most of them will have worked out
to tell you how you do it.
After doing it a few times, renew their interests
in your ability to tell them how they think, by stay-
ing outside the house .while your assistant asks you
the questions through the key.hole. And then final-
ly "cap the climax" by going to a neighbor's tele- ·
phone (if there is also one in the house at which
the party is held) and answer correctly when the
named object is referred to.
How it is done-Immediately before your assist-
ant names the object your friends selected, he
names some object very dark or black in co~or. This
is the key. To illustrate:
Your Assistant
Was it the ceiling of this room?
My handkerchief?
,You
No
No
12 5 MIND READING ACTS EXPOSED
My hand?
The mirror?
Newspaper? •
Lace ...curtains?
My shoes (if they .are black>?
The dresser?
No
No
No
No
No
Yes
The above is only an illustration. Many more
;questions should be asked in actual performance.
Occasionally, go to the extremes, that is, ask 30 or
4o questions one time, and the next time only two
or three.
.To avoid detection, change the key color to
"white" or "red" occasionally. To escape errors,
avoid asking if the selected object was any object
whose c;olor is half-way between black and white or
only slightly dark, as what one person.would regard
as black, another might not. .
, Always be prepared to answer your friends
forcefully, effectively and comically. This wins for
you prestige. It shows you are a master. When
they find you know your business, that you can do
so many mysterious things and change right off
Erom one to another without a moment's warning,
they will seek your company and you will no longer
be "one of the bunch," but "the one."
