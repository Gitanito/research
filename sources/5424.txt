ECLIPSES
OF THE
SUN and MOON,
That will happen this Year, 1814.
Within the Compafs of this Tear there will happen only
Three Eclipfes ; Two of the Sun, and One of the
Moon ; they will happen in the following Ordery as
they were computed from very exacl Tables of the Sun
and Moon^ founded on the Newtonian System of
Gravitation^ which Tables are found wonderfully to
agree with Observations.
THE firll of thefe Eclipfes is cf the Sun, and happens
on Friday, the 21ft Day of January, at 13 Minutes
paft our Two o'Clock in the Afternoon ; but notsvith-
flanding the Sun is above our Horizon at the Time, the
Eclipfe will be invifible to us, and not to us only, but to
all Europe. The Reafon of which is, the Moon at that
Time has only about One Minute of North Latitude,
fo that in thefe Northern Parts of the Earth, the Moon's
Parallax in Latitude will deprefs the vifible Place of her.
Centre more to the South, than is the Space taken up by
the Sum of the Sem;diameters of the Sun and Moon taken
together ; but in the Southern Parts of the Globe, this
will be a very great Eclipfe, for it will be both central
and annular, that is, a bright Circle of Light will ap-
pear round the Moon's dark Body on every Side, very
beautiful to behold ; and this Appearance will be at their
12 o'Clock at Noon, under 18 Degrees 38 Minutes of
South Latitude, and 33 Degrees 19 Minutes of Weft
Longitude from London ; which Place falls in the great
Southern Atlantic Ocean, rear the Eaftern Coaft of the
Country of Brazil, in South America. This Eclipfe
will be ften, more or lefs in Quantity, to all South
America, and I expect will alfo extend itfelf to fome of
our Well India Iflands.
The Second is another great Eclipfe of the Sun, on
Sunday, the 17th Day of July, at 26 Minutes paft our
6 o'Clock in the Morning ; the Moon's true Latitude at
this Time, I find to be about 1 o Minutes to the North ;
On the Eclipses. 39
yet owing to her Parallax in Latitude, which will deprefs
her fo far to the Southward, as to render this Eclipfe like
the former, invifible to us, efpecially under the Meridian
and Latitude of London ; but in the more Eaftern Parts
of the Globe, it will be a very great Eclipfe, in fo much,
as to be total for two or three Minutes in feveral Parts of
Afia ; for, by my Computations, I find in 30 Degrees 5 1
Minutes of North Latitude, and 84 Degrees 12 Minutes
of Eaft Longitude from London, the Sun will be totally
and centrally eclipfed on the Meridian, or precifely at
their 12 o'Clock at Noon ; which Place falls about 156
Miles to the Eaft of the Town of Sirinagur, fituated in a
large rugged Country of the fame Name, between Hin-
dooftan Proper and Thibet, bounded on the North and
North-Eaft by the Thtbetian Mountains. The Sun will
be feen eclipfed* more or lefs, in fome Parts of Lartary,
and to the Southward, as at Calcutta, Madras, and at
Bombay on the Malabar Coaft.
The Third and laft Eclipfe of this Year, is a partial
one of the Moon, on Monday Night, the 26th Day of
December ; and may be feen by us in this Kingdom, if
the Air prove favourable, and not by us only, but alfo by
the Inhabitants of all the States and Kingdoms in Europe
and Africa, together with the Weftern Parts of Africa,
and the Eaftern Parts of America; but in Siam, China,
Chinefe" Tartary, &c. in the Eaftern Parts of Afia, the
Fore-part only will be vifible, the Moon fetting with them
before>the Eclipfe bs over, as appears by confidering her
Pofition, in refpedl of thofe Parts of the Earth during
the Time of the Ecl?p?e ; for at the Beginning 4
flie is
vertical to the Kingdom of Nubia in Africa, among the
Sandy Defarts, under 22 Degrees 33 Minutes of North
Latitude; 30 Degrees 18 Minutes Eaft from London.
At the Time of the Middle, the Moor is vertical to that
fandy and burning Defart of Bilma, lying to the North of

IX STROLOGY is an Art whereby future Events are
foreknown by their proper natural Signs and Caufes, being
i
no other than the Hii-ory of Natural Accidents, which will,
fin a certain Period of Time, by fame known Caufe, be pro-
I duced. , Now thefe Caufes are chiefly the Sun, Moon, and
;
other Planets, together with the Conftellations of Heaven,
ias God himfelf is pleafed to teftify, fee Gen. i. 14, where
you meet witn thefe Words ; And God faid, Let there be
Lights in the Firmament of Heaven , todivice the Day from
^he Night; and let them be lor Signs and for Seafons, and
for Days and for Years. Here you fee they are ordained

for Signs, that is, Tokens foreftiewing fome Accident in I
Time to be produced; and that they are the Caufes of fuchj
Accidents, fee Job xxxviii. 31, 32, where God, treating,
with Job, asketh thefe words ; Canft thou bind the fweetj
Influences of Pleiades (the 7 Stars) or loofe the Bands oft
Orion ? Canft thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his Seafons ?
or canft thou guide Acturus with his Sons ? Which plainly
mews the Stars to be Caufes of fuch accidental Mutations)
and Changes, as we weakly term them, elfe why mould!
God enumerate the reftraining of their Influence amongftfj
his Works of Wonder? and that they are ordained for that I
End, namely, by their Influence, to order and difpofe the I
Affairs of this inferior World, not only Authority of Scrip-
H
tare, but natural Reafon, yea even daily Experience doth
sufficiently confirm; for to what End, I pray you, serve!
the various Motions of the Planets, Appearance of Comet* j|
at certain Seafons, the Full and Changes of the Moon-,
&c. If they were created only to give Light by Night,
as fome People would perfuade the World they were, 1
1
hope they will not pretend that their difappearing foci
feveral Nights, nay Months, efpecially the Moon, whichil
for a third Part of each Revolution, makes little or no Ap-I
pearance, is a Defect or Over fight of their Creator, byl
whofe Almighty Power, and A!l-wife Decrees, they were!
framed, and ordered thus to move ; but in cafe they serve!
I
for no other End than that, namely, to give Light by
Night, it muft of Neceflity be thus concluded which to
affirm were the higheft Blafphemy. Ye: who even amongft
the wifeft of our Adverfaries can deny, but that had tne
Planets, efpecially the Moon, which in this refpedl is the
principal of them, her Light being fo manifeft ; that had
they, I fay, been fo paced as 10 have appeared at the
Sun's Departure, they would, to much greater Perfection,
have performed that Office; therefore it muft of Necef-
fity be allowed, that the Planets and Scars were created
for a more noble End, than barely to give Light upon the
Earth ; which, would my Room permit, I could abund-
antly prove, by my own Experience, in sundry Inftances
of Peace, War, Plenty, Scarcity, Sicknefs, &c. but I
mall content myfelf at prefent with thefe few and undeni-
able Proofs following, which are obvious to the Eyes of
any unprejudiced Perfon, namely, when Saturn beholds

the Sun, or Mars Venus, either by Quartileor Oppofition,
or be joined with them from or in watery or airy Signs,
they are generally attended with windy, and for the moft
Part very wet Weather ; and if other ftrong Teftimonies
contradict not, may certainly be relied on. And who can
deny the Influence of the Moon over all Human Bodies ?
Do not the Tides ebb and flow, increafe or diminifh, as
that Luminary doth increafe or decreafe in Light ? Nay,
they even come and go, as it were, at her Command ; and
such is her powerful Dominion over Human Bodies, that
any one of the Female Sex, be Hie ever fo ignorant, if her
Age do but reach the Teens, is capable of unfolding this
Mvftery. Thus having made it appear, that the Stars are
both Sig-ns and Caufes of fublunary Mutations and
CJhanges, I come next to ihew after what Manner, and
#y what Means, we attain to the Knowledge thereof.
—
It was not in fo ftiort a Time as one, two, or three Cen-
turies of Years, that Man attained to fo per feci: a Know-
ledge in this divine Art, as to forefee Wars, Peace, Plenty,
Scarcity, but by the diligent Obfervations of many
Ages, comparing the Events of one Century with, thofe of
another, and both with the then impending Configura-
tions of the Celeftial Harbingers, was found out the na-
tural Difpofitions of each Planet and Sign ;
by a long
Series of Obfervations, I fay it was, that the World dis-
covered one Planet to be the Propagator of Cold and
Drought ; another Heat and Moifture ; a third, hot and
burning ; this of an equal Temperament, that increaling
Moifture, whilit, another is convertible to either ; and all
thefe active Qualities augmented or dimintfhed in this or
that Part of Heaven, with this or that fixed Star or Con-
ftellation. — Thus having difcovered the natural Quality
of each Pianet and Sign, by the Accidents, Mutations,
and Changes of the World, ; Temperaments, and Habits
,of Men ; and having, by Aftronomical Obfervations, found
out the juft Period of each Pianet's Revo f
ution through the
Zodiack ; being thereby enabled to behold, as it were at
a Diftance, the Positions of the Planets, and how Confi-
gurations, that is to fay, in what Part of the Zodiac, and
with what remarkable fixed Star each Planet would be
placed, at the End of a Month, Year, or what Diftance
I of Time any Perfon was pleafed to appoint ; as alfo
44 Partridge, 1814.
in what Part of Heaven each Planet would be located,
whether in the Eaft or West, above or under the Earth, j
and with what Afpect they would at any fuch Time behold i
each other ; alfo what Hour of the Day they would
rife, culminate, or fet. —Being, I fay, qualified to difcover
j
thefe and the like Particulars, they then found it no hard
Matter to attain to a Foreknowledge of the feveral Acci-
dents which at that Time would, in all probability, (hew
themfelves. —For that Man who by the Accident can dif- \
cover the Caufc, before unknown, may, with much more
Eafe, difcover the Accident by the known Caufe ; and this
and no other is the Ground from which all the Sons of :
Urania deduce their rational Prediciions ; these are the |
Practices which fo many exclaim againft as diabolical
Sorcery and Witchcraft ; thefe are the juggling Cheats,
fo much exploded by thofe very Perfons who, at the samq
Time, do notfcruple to pradife the like Prognoftics. For
who of all thefe, our Condemnors, seeing a Perfon of a
slow aukward Pace, with a dark, cloudy, morofe Afpecl, 1
doth not condemn him for a furly, ill-natured, covetou#
Fellow?

Judicium Astrologicum, pro Anno 1814.
Or, an AJirological Judgment upon the Four Sjhiarterly
Ingrefses of the prefent Year \ and Firji^ of the Brumal
Ingrefsy or Winter Quarter.
HpH& Winter Quarter begins when the Sun enters the
JL Tropic of Capricorn* which this Year happens on
Wedvefday, the 2ic\ of December, 1813, at io min. pad 4
o'Clock in the Morning at which Time 14 Deg. of At-
will afcend in the Eaft, and the firft Degree of Vtrgo-\
will be upon the Meridian —All the Piancts I find are'|
under the Earth, excepting Jupiter, whicn will be at!
that Time nearly fu'l South, and very -nearly in Oppofi-s
tion to the Plane, Mars, which is pofited in the lower
Angle of the Figute. — The D ad of ^, ad vac. 6 of the
Sun. In taking a View of this figure of the Heavens,, and J
Aftrological Obfervations. 45
confidering the Pofitions and Configurations of the Planets*
it appears that there will be in this Quarter many great
Councils and Confutations held, in the different Courts
•f Europe, and perhaps it may be on the Subject of Nego-
ciation and Peace, and change of Illands, or concerning
forne Alterations in States and Kingdoms; if this in fome
Meafure has not been done already, at lead there is fome
Reafon to expect it, during the Courfe of the enfuing
Year, as I find the Planets are more harmoaicus among
themselves, by Trine and Sextile Afpects, than they have
been for fome Years pad ; and which 1 would hope will
f
incline Men's Minds to Peace and Concord alfo. How-
ever, I expect fome Overtures for Peace, frjom forne of the
Powers at War connected with Great Britain.*—! expect
fome great Defigns and Actions arc on Foot, or may be fo
in a few Months, upon the Continent of Europe, as in
PruJJia, Holland, France, Germany, in Spain and Por-
tugal ; the Northern Powers, fuch as Sweden, RuJJia, and
Denmark, will be taken up in thefe Confutations and De-
signs ; however, there feems to be fomething that will be
/carried on; but Time mud produce the Particulars. —The
two malevolent Planets, Saturn and Mars, will come
to a Square Aipect, on the 4th of February, from the
Signs Capricorn and Aries, which is the mod rugged Af-
pect in this Quarter, and will produce Broils and Discon-
tents; it feems, I think, to point at the Ruffians, Tartars,
|
and fome German Princes; but I {till fay, Great Britain
has nothing to fear from the French, her word Enemy, if
fhe is but jud to herfelf. —It alfo feems that Buonaparte,
though ne has been harrafT d and preffed hard on every
Side, and involved by the furroundisg Powers at War
into great Difficulties and Diftrefs, dill feems to brave all
his Opponents ; yet I think the Eyes of all the Powers of
Europe have been opened within this Year or two, as to
caufe them to make great Struggles, to overcome the
. Vaunts and Menaces of the French Government.—It alfo
feems the United States of America will be much agitated
by War, Broils, Difcontents, &c.

Th e SPRING QUARTER,
Or, the Sun's Tran/it through <YS b* > and n.
THE Spring Quarter begins when the Sun enters the
Equinoctial Sign Aries, which will this Year happen
on Monday, the 2 ill of March, at 37 min. pall 5 o'Clock
in the Morning, when 17 Deg. of K are attending in the
Eaf!:, and 25 Deg. of £ will be on the Mid-Heaven.—
The Moon in the Afcendant, applying to a Conjunction
of the Sun in Aries, and departing from a Conjunction
of Venus, and next applying and beholding the Planet
Saturn with a Sextile Afpect. Now the firft Thing to be
noticed at this Ingress is, the Pofition of the Sun, Moon,
and Mercury, in the Eaftern Angle of the Figure, from
all which I should fuppofe fome Negociations may be
going forward, tending to reftore to the diftrefled Coun-
tries the Bleflings of Peace ; but yet I am afraid, accord-
ing to what I can fee from the Figure, that the Lull of\
Ambition, and the Rage of Revenge, will continue to>
diftract and dillurb many Parts of Europe, including Great
Britain, as connected with the reft of Europe, by the reft,
lefs Ambition of the Government of France, as well as
fome other Powers that are at War. — This, like former)
Years, is likely to be a very bufy Year with all the Euro-
pean Powers, and many will fall under great Troubles, on
account of hafty and ralh Proceedings, which I expect will
be the Cafe with the United States of America, if a Ne-
gotiation for Peace has not by this Time fucceeded, and
that under the Influence of the Trine Afpect of Jupiter and
Saturn, which takes Place this Year ; I am doubtful of its
being concluded (I mean a General Peace) for fome Time
yet to come, as the approaching Oppofition of Saturn and
Mars, from Tropical Signs, will ferment the Minds of
Men fo much, that their Paflions will run high, and will,
I fear, not be eafily reduced to Reafon ; which has been
too much the Cafe lor many Years back, and have been the
Occafion of all our Wars and Troubles. —Much might be'
faid, had 1 Room, from this Figure of the Heavens at
this Ingrefs, concerning the general Tranfactions of the
World ; but I mall only obferve in particular, that fome

great Changes, in the feveral Parts of Europe, arc drawing
on, the Providence of the Almighty doth ib order Celef-
tial Influences, by his immutable Decrees, that exceflive
Tyranny mull, at laft, yield to Juftice and Moderation.
The SUMMER QUARTER,
Or, The Sun's tranfit through 25, SI* and ^
THIS Quarter begins when the Sun enters the firft
Point of the Tropical Sign Cancer, which, by my
Calculations, happens this Year on Wednesday, the 22d of
June, at 10 min. paft 3 o'Clock in the Morning ; at which
Time 15 Deg. of ZZ are upon the Meridian, and 21 Deg.
of n upon the Cufp of the Afcendant. The J)abnof $ .
•The moft material Afpe&s at this Ingrefs are, an Oppofi-
tion of Saturn and Mercury, and an Oppofition of Saturn
and Mars from Tropical Signs, which Oppofitions will
be of great Importance to many Places, Kingdoms, and
Countries, such as Ruflia, Sweden, Denmark, with France,
'Great Britain, and feveral Parts of Germany ; its Effect
will alfo extend itfelf into the Southern Parts of Europe,
and alfo Weftward to the United States of America.—This
Oppofition of Saturn and Mars Simulates fome great
Changes and Alterations in the World, with Broils and
Difcontents ; with Wars and Effufion of Human Blood,
where Armies are on Foot.—As to France, I think me is
fick of an Ulcer in her own Bowels. The Spirit of God is
performing Wonders in all Nations, in order to bring
about that great Work of Reformation, which we are now
waiting for and daily expecling.
The AUTUMNAL QUARTER,
Or, the Suns Tranfit through Vt^, and f .
THIS Quarter begins when the Sun enters the Equi-
noctial Sign Libra, making our Days and Nights
once more equal, which this Year happens on Friday, the
23d Day of September, at 55 min. paft 4 o'Clock: in the
Afternoon, when 23 Deg. of ZZ afcend in the Eaft, and
15 Deg. of £ are on the Mid-Heaven. The D ab<5 of J?

«t A of 11, et A of Man, In a few Days after happens
the famous Trine Afpett of Jupiter and Saturn ; and juft:
before thefe was a Conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in
Virgo, the Afcendant of France ; and what is rather re-
markable, thefe Planets occupy at this Ingrefs the Weftern
Angle of the Figure, and they are but juft above th«
Earth; the Moon in an exacl Conjunction of the Planet
Saturn, in the i2thHoufeof the Figure, and in Capricorn.
Some of thefe Afpe&s are of a very promifing Import, as
if Things were drawing on for the better; I wifh it
may turn out to be fo. — Some Countries may obtain
Peace, and England may gain fome Advantages, yet
no General Peace is likely, I doubt, to take Place
;
for the Political Affairs of Europe ftand as yet very un-
settled, and in a very uncertain Pofture. The Effecls
of the late Comets are not yet over ; nor will, I apprejfc
hend, for fome Years vet to come.
